The authors revisit the analysis of Chen et al. 2023a/b and improve upon it in terms of dimensional dependence (from $d^2$ to $d$, which is further argued to now be optimal). This improvement stems from a refined discretization analysis using ideas from the stochastic localization literature."

There are some caveats here that I detail below but this is nothing that cannot be adressed by a round of further proof-reading. Although I did not check the appendix in sufficient detail to vouch for correctness, I think their math is generally OK to follow.\n\n- In terms of originality, the authors observe that Conforti et al. have produced a similar result in a parallell submission. I don't see this as an issue for publishing this manuscript at ICLR. I think it is safe to say that these have been developed in parallell and given the different techniques used they are both independently of each other of interest to the community---in my view the ideas herein are fairly original and interesting."

I do have a few remarks on writing though:\n\n- The notation is a little messy throughout and feels somewhat rushed/needs further proofreading. There are quite a few undefined/implicitly defined objects. Let me give a few examples:\n\n    -  Previous to stating the main theorem, the main object of interest $p_{t_N}$ has never been defined. \n    - The use of bold $\\mathbf{x}$  for realization when defining conditional objects is a little confusing when at the same time $\\mathbf{x}_*$ is a random variable. This is also in conflict with the use in equation 3 where $\\mathbf{x}_t$ is a random variable drawn from $q_t$. It would be helpful if there was a consistent distinction between realization and random object throughout and if this were defined early in the manuscript.\n   -  The notation for conditional expectation given the observation (function $\\mathbf{a}$)  following eqn 6 is unnecessarily dense. In particular, that the LHS depends on $U_s$ whereas the RHS depends on $\\mu_s$ is a little confusing at first glance. It would be good if the authors were a little more parsimonious and consistent in their notation---at least when introducing objects for the first time.\n\n\n*Other comments*:\n\n\n- Following Lemma 1 it would not hurt to expound a little on the significance of the covariance matrix and why it will be useful in the sequel. It would be nice if some version of what is stated \"inside\" the proof of thm 1, second paragraph, appears near this lemma.\n\n- Above equation (9) there is an extraneous square in the definition of the Frobenius norm (and the square root should probably be outside of the trace)"

I do not immediately see how this follows from the standard Ito Isometry relating squares of stochastic integrals and integrals of their squares.\n\nFollowing the statement of proposition 4 could you be a little more precise/remind us about which stochastic transformation is used in the invokation of the data-processing inequality?

One dumb question: doesn't the second part of Assumption 2 imply its first part? Or am I mis-interpreting the meaning of second moment of a distribution on R^d?\n\n3. It is claimed that the isotropic condition in Assumption 2 is not essential. However, this has never been formally justified, if I'm not missing it. Which nuisance of the proof needs to be changed if the covariance is general? In fact, I have some doubt on the claim that this assumption is immaterial. What if the covariance is not strictly positive definite? What if the covariance is **unknown**?\n\n4. In the line following equation (9), there seems to be some typos in the equations for verifying the applicability of Fubini. \n\n5. Right before the statement of Lemma 6, it's claimed that the existence of t_M = T-1 is WLOG. This is likely technical but I suggest briefly justify it. I guess if this does not hold, a tiny approximation error needs to be introduced.\n\n6. Please introduce the notation $\\lesssim$ somewhere if it's not been done yet. I assume that this means the LHS is upper bounded by the RHS multiplied by a numerical constant. \n\n7. It's argued informally in section 4 (with some details in appendix G) that the linear dependence of the convergence rate on d is necessary. \nThis seems like a nice observation. Is it possible to turn it into a formal proposition and specify how this lower bound depends on other parameters besides d? In fact, this observation is a little surprising to me since for product distribution, the problem is effectively 1-dimensional however denoising diffusion still incurs a dimension-dependence. Could the authors offer some more intuition? Thanks in advance."

This paper seeks to prove mixing bounds for the reverse diffusion process after the denoising score model has been learned. In particular, under the assumptions of a learned score function with an L2 error bound and a data distribution with identity covariance, the authors use the theory of stochastic localization to yield a bound on the KL divergence between the generated samples and the data distribution. This bound those that the number of iterates to reach error $\\epsilon$ scales linearly in $d$, quadratically in the forward time $T$, and $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ with respect to $\\epsilon$."

This is important since about a third of the paper is dedicated to explaining the proof of Theorem 1. I found their explanation to be hard to follow. First, I would appreciate a roadmap explaining precisely what steps are new/novel and what steps are guided by past work. In particular, it seems that the work on the discretization error is new, so the authors are then able to apply the bound from stochastic localization. However, is the perspective taken where they view the single process $(Y_t)$ as solutions to (2) and (4) under different measures new? The biggest issue, though, in my opinion, is that much of the proof is left to the appendix. I understand this is necessary, but without more interpretation in the paper to help the reader understand what is happening, it is easy to get lost. Improving this explanation would greatly help the paper since it is primarily theoretical. Some suggestions are the following.\n\nSetup\n- More clearly define the measures $P^{\\cdot}$ and $Q$, and explain how $(Y_t)$ is a solution to (2) and (4) under these measures.\nBound on the discretization error\n- An initial lemma saying the final bound for this section so that the reader can put into context the computations being done. Then, put Lemmas 2-6 into context for how they help with the final bound as they are discussed.\nGirasanov\n- Again, state the final bound as a lemma so that the discussion can be put into context.

Roughly speaking, a diffusion model is a method for sampling from a data distribution $q_0$ that \"works\" whenever one can approximate the scores $\\nabla q_t(\\cdot)$ well, where $q_t$ is the density of a particle undergoing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics from $q_0$. Usually, score approximations would be found with deep neural networks. \n\nPrevious results by other authors obtained bounds relating the quality of score approximations to the distance between $q_0$ and the distribution output by the diffusion model. The present paper gives improved bounds: the main difference is that the error in approximating scores is not multiplied by any time- or -dimension dependent factors, but only by a universal constant.   The proof of this result follows the outline of previous work by Chen, Lee and Lu; the main modification (according to the authors) is in dealing with discretization errors.is"

The central novelty of the paper's analysis is the incorporation of the decay of the expected covariance of the denoising posterior measure during the process of the sampling. The rate of the decay is obtained through results in the stochastic localization literature, which is subsequently combined with the existing analysis based on Girsanov's theorem. The analysis leads to an improved dependence of the iteration-complexity on the input dimension in the absence of a uniform-Lipschitz assumption on the score function."

(2023a;d).\n- The paper improves upon best existing bounds in the absence of uniform-Lipschitzness of the score function. However, more explanation is required to understand why Lipschitzness is a limiting assumption.  For instance, while for discrete measures it is apparent that one must resort to early stopping on a corrupted version of the distribution, it requires further justification for measures absolutely continuous w.r.t the Lebesgue measure. Futhermore, the proofs in the algorithmic stochastic localization works such as El Alaoui et al. (2022), themselves rely on the Lipschitzness of the estimated score function. \n- Assumption 1 of approximating the score to arbitrary error, while utilized in existing works, is unrealistic for several setups. For instance, some recent works have highlighted statistical and computational barriers towards the estimation of the score function, in particular the works El Alaoui et al., 2022; Montanari & Wu, 2023, as well as:\n\n   Biroli, G., & M\u00e9zard, M.

What iteration complexity could one expect under smoothness assumptions non-uniform in time?\n- In Lemma 5, the covariance bound in Lemma 1 is utilized to bound the expected Frobenius norm of the Jacobian of the score function. Can this be interpreted as establishing an average-Lipschitzness of the score function?\n- Are deterministic sampling schemes expected to yield identical iteration complexities?\n\n## Suggestions\n- In the title, it should be clarified that \"linear convergence\" refers to being linear in the input dimension, to avoid confusion with the use of the term \"linear convergence\" in the optimization literature.\n- To improve clarity, one could clarify that the SDE in Eq. 6 and the noisy observation process in Eq. 5 are equivalent only in law.\n- I suggest mentioning in sections 1.1 and 1.2 how the posterior means are related to the score function."
