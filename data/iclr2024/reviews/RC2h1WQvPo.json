In my view, this lack of novelty and originality raises questions about whether this paper is suitable for submission to ICLR, as it could be perceived as a dual submission.\n\n* Insufficient Experimental Rigor: The experimental setup in the paper is notably lacking in terms of rigor. The absence of quantitative metrics and reliance solely on visualizations is a significant shortcoming. Without comprehensive metrics, the results can be susceptible to cherry-picking and fail to provide a strong empirical validation of the method."

The main intuition of the paper is that the corner points of the space-filling curves (i.e., VQ codebook elements), which is expected to capture the structure of the latent space, will refer to similar content, and thus will provide a path to control/interpret the generation process. The proposed method is compared qualitatively with GANSpace, an unsupervised method for discovering interpretable direction using PCA, on two GAN architectures (StyleGAN2 and BigGAN)."

These works are both unsupervised and model-agnostic, and, similarly to GANSpace, should necessarily be included in the experimental evaluation of the proposed method.\n\nSecond, the presented empirical evaluation is only qualitative, rendering impossible to compare its advantages against GANSpace (and other relevant works that are missing [1, 2]). Even in that case, in the only figure that provides comparison with an existing work (i.e., Fig. 7, comparison with GANSpace), it is hardly visible why the proposed method is better.\n\nIn absence of any quantitative comparison, it is impossible to assess the merits of the proposed method. Appropriate quantitative metrics can be found in [1, 2]. In my point of view, the paper should compare with those methods using the suggested metrics.\n\nFinally, I found the structure of the paper hard to follow. Specifically, Sect. 4 appears to be a few unstructured blocks of text discussing limited empirical results. Also, in many occasions, the paper makes unsupported or inaccurate claims. For instance, \"our unsupervised proposed method neither needs any human labeling nor puts any constraint on the learned latent distribution\" is not true according to Sect. 4.2 (for instance).\n\n\n[1] Aoshima, Takehiro, and Takashi Matsubara. \"Deep Curvilinear Editing: Commutative and Nonlinear Image Manipulation for Pretrained Deep Generative Model.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2023.\n[2] Tzelepis, Christos, Georgios Tzimiropoulos, and Ioannis Patras. \"Warpedganspace: Finding non-linear rbf paths in gan latent space.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2021."

StyleGAN2 is not a conditional GAN, that class label is not given during generation.\n\nHave you considered other latent space, such as W+ or the so-called style space S? I think it would be interesting to do so, since:\ni) W+ can be split into 18 512-dimensional sub-spaces, where learning a SFVQ for each sub-space (layer) could lead to further controlability/interpretability, and\nii) the style space S is remarkably disentangled (changing a single element/dimension could lead to a very specific and disentangled change, such as gaze movement)."
