Even though the authors claim that AV-CPL performs {AV, A, V}SR with a single model (compared to SSL models fine-tuned separately for each task), it actually exhibits significant variations in performance across these tasks due to different training strategies (e.g, modality dropout probability, PL stage)\n 2. Considering that VSR is a less common and more challenging task than ASR, I have some reservations about the necessity of a 3-in-1 model that achieves approximately 40% WER on VSR, as opposed to having a dedicated VSR-specific model that can achieve around 20-30% WER for VSR alone.\n 3. In Table 3, the difference in performance between AV-CLP and u-Hubert is not well explained, despite the similar training conditions (number of parameters, no separate FT).\n4. The baseline, defined as solely trained on labeled data, is relatively weak."
