Further, it is practical, as it avoids the need for labeling the exact correspondence of the cross-domain trajectories.\n3.

It would be good if the authors could provide more analysis of these results. Besides, I wonder if PLP (including PLP-disc) is sensitive to the hyperparameter choices.\n2. In Table 2, the ablated variant of the proposed model, BC + MMD, outperforms PLP-full on three out of six tasks. This raises a question about the necessity of the TCC component in the overall framework. Further clarification on the role and impact of TCC in improving performance across various tasks would provide valuable insights. \n3. The method's effectiveness appears to be closely tied to the similarity between the source and target domains. However, the paper lacks an in-depth analysis of this issue concerning PLP's performance in various practical scenarios. It would be valuable to explore how the method performs when dealing with expert demonstrations solely from a highly dissimilar source domain, as well as when utilizing demonstrations exclusively from the target domain (where the source and target domains are identical). Additionally, the paper could benefit from further discussions regarding strategies for identifying a reliable source domain.\n4.

The core innovation of the paper is a method that enables knowledge transfer across different domains without the need for exact one-to-one correspondence between those domains. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the domains are significantly different in terms of observation space, action space, or agent morphology.\n\nTo achieve this, the authors propose a technique that leverages a shared latent representation space. This space is crafted using signals from multi-domain imitation learning and is further refined with domain confusion regularization via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). This contrasts with previous methods that heavily relied on domain translation techniques. It requires only a policy network and a few loss terms for optimization, making it more straightforward than other offline cross-domain transfer methods that typically need more models and objectives.\n\nThe authors evaluate their approach across a variety of domain shifts, including changes in observation, action, viewpoint, and agent morphology. The results demonstrate that their method outperforms existing methods, especially in situations where an exact translation of states or actions is difficult or impossible to achieve. The paper also shows that the method has superior adaptation capabilities for out-of-distribution tasks and that MMD regularization performs better than discriminative training approaches in these contexts."

                "value": "My concerns focus on the possible novelty issues and motivations.\n1) The paper posits that existing domain translation methods struggle with large discrepancies between domains and may not provide stable cross-domain alignment. However, this claim lacks empirical evidence or a theoretical foundation within the paper, which weakens the argument. A comparative analysis or quantitative evidence would strengthen the case for the proposed method's necessity and superiority. Besides, in general, we conduct the domain adaptation when there is no huge distribution shift.  For example, in [1], the target shift is difficult to solve if there are no further assumptions. The examples shown in the introduction parts have less practical application significance, such as the adaption from the agent with no legs to other agents with multiple legs.\n2) For this toy motivational example, despite acknowledging this issue, this paper doesn't involve it in their experimental evaluations. Including such a scenario, especially one that has been previously explored in the literature, would not only validate the method's effectiveness in extreme cases but also provide a direct comparison to existing solutions. This toy experiment has been explored in [2]. \n3) The paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of other methods that tackle generalization in reinforcement learning. By comparing the proposed method to these existing approaches, the authors would better situate their work within the current research landscape and potentially highlight the unique advantages of their approach. For example, [2,3,4,5] also explores the generalization problem in the reinforcement learning field. \n4) The potential novelty issue.  This method is based on MMD, which is widely used in domain adaptation. What is the unique contribution to introducing MMD into reinforcement learning? Do the weaknesses in MMD still exist in this field, such as MMD's sensitivity to kernel choice and its performance in high-dimensional spaces?\n5) While the method claims to be computationally simpler, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of computational costs or training times compared to other methods. Such an analysis would be beneficial for practical applications where computational resources and efficiency are critical factors.\n\n\n\n[1]Zhang K, Sch\u00f6lkopf B, Muandet K, et al.

                "value": "The paper presents a novel approach to align representations between two robotic domains by training an encoder, a policy based on an MDP, and a decoder. The method is tested in downstream tasks, showing promise in its primary objectives. However, it requires additional experimentation to substantiate its claims and illustrate its significance fully."

                "value": "1. Clarify the environment setup. Specifically, define the observational shift in P2P-obs and detail the P2A action space for both Point and Ant agents.\n2. Expand the variety of domain transfers. This paper completed P2P and P2A. But we have never\u00a0had a robot resembling a Point robot in the real world.\u00a0Why not Ant2Hopper? Can you run more combinatorial options: Ant2Hopper, Ant2Walker2D? Can you include multiple source domains e.g., Ant, Hopper, Walker2D and HalfCheetah? With the promise of a general alignment method, it is necessary see how well the method perform on general and more realistic domains. While P2P and P2A transfers have been completed, the absence of a Point robot raises questions. Exploring transfers like Ant2Hopper or Ant2Walker2D and including multiple source domains (e.g., Ant, Hopper, Walker2D, HalfCheetah) would significantly showcase the generalizability of the method across more realistic domains.\n3. Reevaluate the manipulation task in the R2R-Lift scenario. The current evaluation R2R-Lift\u00a0is completed on\u00a0end effector delta space. So the task setup combines (1) tabletop manipulation task like lift where the robot barely needs to rotate the wrist, (2) in end effector delta space, (3) using low dimensional vector space representation. The current setup is too simplistic to conclusively determine the method's effectiveness. Introducing tasks that require wrist rotation, controlling manipulators over joint space, or running R2R in the visual space could provide a more robust assessment.\n4. V2V uses the same robot in the transfer. In this case, the encoder is essentially learning a viewpoint transformation. Address the V2V task's potential overlap with existing viewpoint transformation methods. A comparison with state-of-the-art viewpoint alignment methods could highlight the unique contributions of your work.\n5. The proposal is learning two modules, encoder and decoder. It could help increase the impact of this paper to design evaluations to\u00a0separately\u00a0test\u00a0how well your proposal is learning the encoder (e.g. your V2V task where the visual inputs are from different perspectives) and decoder (e.g. transfer between two domains with non-trivial action space).\n6. Increase the robustness of statistical claims by conducting more trials. Ideally, such simulator task should be evaluated with \u22653 different random seeds across \u226520 runs.\n7. Discuss the assumption that multiple MDPs share a common latent structure. The paper should acknowledge the potential risks of aligning distributions that do not naturally overlap, and if possible, provide an argument against this critique.\n8. Explore and discuss alternative loss functions. The motivation behind the choice of losses is clear, yet an exploration of alternatives could be insightful for the reader and the field."
