One setting is that we don't know whether the label is hard or soft. The other setting is that we don't know the specific format of the soft label. I think these two settings are closer to the real-world cases.\n\nMinors:\n- In Figure 2, it is better to also zoom in and visualize the global minimum similarly.\n- In Table 2 caption, experiences > experiments."
