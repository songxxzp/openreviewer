                "value": "The author studies the flood regularization technique for relieving the overfitting of the deep neural network training and proposes an adaptive flood regularization technique, i.e., provides instance(sample)-wise adaptive weighting (flooding level) for calculating the flooding loss. This instance-wise weighting is determined by the auxiliary networks which are trained by subsets of the whole training dataset with five-fold cross-validation, and these auxiliary networks are fixed only to provide an estimation of the sample's difficulty, i.e., the loss between the auxiliary models' prediction and the input's ground-truth label. To mitigate the unavoidable imperfectness of the auxiliary model, the author also proposed a correction function to modify the prediction of the auxiliary model, i.e., linearly interpolates the predictions and the ground-truth labels. The author also provides ways to improve the training efficiency of the auxiliary networks by fine-tuning the last few layers of the auxiliary model such that they can use only one auxiliary model instead of multiple ones. The author also provides a theoretical intuition about the benefit of using adaptive flooding. Extensive experiments are conducted over text, images, asynchronous event sequences, and tabular data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The limited novelty of the proposed paper. \n\nThe idea of using adaptive weighting for model training is widely used in existing machine learning areas, the more relevant ones can be curriculum learning and uncertainty learning. Moreover, as mentioned by the author in Related Work, using a held-out dataset to condition the training of the primary model is a well-known strategy in machine learning, e.g., in meta-learning, batch or data selection, neural architecture search, etc. In the present paper, the author integrates the adaptive flooding level for flooding regularization, which is just a naive combination of the existing methods. Thus the novelty of the present paper is limited.\n\nAlthough the author proposes a correction function to account for the imperfections of the prediction of the auxiliary model, the proposed correction function is very heuristic, and there is no theoretical analysis to reason about the soundness of this proposed function. The efficient training for the auxiliary networks also has a similar issue.\n\nOverall, although the author provided a theoretical intuition for Equation (3), which is the training objective for adaptive flooding, the technical details to optimize this loss function proposed by the present paper are too heuristic and hard to be a principle and systematic approach.\n\n2. The significance of the proposed method\n\nAlthough the reviewer acknowledges the effort the author has made to validate their proposed method by the different modality of data, the data, and model chosen by the author is still not convincing. For example, though the SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 are commonly used classification datasets, their complexity, scale, and reality are much less than ImageNet and more recent datasets like LAION. Although the review acknowledges that the author has stated in the last two lines of Page 7 that the result of the proposed method is not significant, this still gives us a feeling that the proposed method will not significantly improve the DNN training to avoid overfitting given so marginal improvement on Table 2. It is better for the author to consider a more realistic and decent scale of the dataset to conduct the experiment to show that the proposed simple method can achieve much better performance than state-of-the-art (SOTA), otherwise, it is hard to demonstrate the significance of the proposed method.\n\n3. The efficient training strategy is mainly randomly re-initializing the last few layers of the model and then re-training with the relevant fold held out. How to define the term \"few\"? What's the principle here to choose those layers? The reviewer noticed that the author said ResNet-18 is a large model and used it in the experiment. Can the proposed method still work effectively when we use ViT for image classification and Transformer for text modality? Will this efficient training strategy still work?\n\n4. The author states in the third paragraph of page 5 that: \n\n\"This procedure is justified by recent understanding in the field that in typical settings, a single data point only loosely influence\nthe early layers of a network.\"\n\nThe author should provide explicit references to support this claim, e.g. what recent understanding does the author refer to? How do they relate to the proposed method?\n\nMinor:\n\n1. The `Unreg.` in Figure 3 can not be seen. The author may consider another format of the line for better visualization."

The rigidly uniform and offline nature of difficulty estimation may misalign with the dynamic ebb and flow of instance contributions across various training stages.\n\n(3) A confined exploration limited to toy datasets raises eyebrows, leaving unanswered questions regarding AdaFlood\u2019s effectiveness when unleashed on larger, real-world, and more challenging benchmarks.\n\n(4) The paper's theatrical stage seems restricted to closed-set supervised classification, leaving realms like self-supervised learning, like contrastive learning in vision and auto-regression in NLP, unnoticed.\n\n(5) The improvement seems to be marginal compared with the baselines in both visual and NLP tasks, according to Tab. 1 and Tab. 2."
