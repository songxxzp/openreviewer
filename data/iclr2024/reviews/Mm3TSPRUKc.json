In order to facilitate the study, the paper introduces a \"new human-curated Chinese dataset, comprising more than 40,000 instruction-output pairs, each subject to stringent quality control\" which is assembled from existing sources (C3-D, PRM800K, COIG, etc) and \u2248 1K additional examples of \"Creative Writing User Queries from In-House Data\". Experiments with this dataset show some abilities are learned easily using limited data regardless of model size, while other abilities are relatively unresponsive to both factors. Additional experiments show synthetic data is less helpful overall."

The release of clean non-English instruction tuning data is a valuable contribution that could benefit future work."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The presentation of the experiments with synthetic data is unclear. I believe the dataset used is from [1], but it would be helpful to make this clear and for the paper to include some details about the dataset for the sake of remaining self-contained. Additionally, as far as I can tell this dataset is not balanced with respect to capability frequency in the same way the human-authored data is. This makes it unclear the extent to which these results are meaningfully comparable.\n2. I find the evaluation methodology used for \"Open-ended questions\" questionable. While the probability-based ranking is intuitive, fine-tuned LMs are known to be poorly calibrated [2]. As a result, I am not convinced a model's ability to rank a specific set of pre-specified completions by perplexity correctly necessarily reflects performance characteristics in real-world settings. The random (or close to random) performance in many settings (all models are worse than random for \"Role-play Chat\") reinforces these concerns.\n3. Improving non-English instruction tuned LMs based on English foundation models is an important direction. Unfortunately, it is also a potential confounder for the type of broad conclusions drawn in this paper. It seems plausible that many of the conclusions could be explained due to this discrepancy. This issue should be addressed in the paper.\n4. The out-of-distribution capabilities don't seem like the same kind of \"capabilities\" as the in-distribution capabilities, e.g., \"Creative Writing\" and \"Logical Reasoning\" are very different in breadth/scope than \"Urban & Rural Planning\".\n5. The paper makes broad claims regarding the relative value of synthetic data that are not well supported. Numerous past works (cited in this paper) show clear improvements using synthetic data. I would expect such claims to be supported by experiments on more datasets and consider more than a single synthetic method.\n\n**Other Issues**\n\n1. I'm confused by the sentence \"We normalize the final scores to a percentage scale to align with the in-domain evaluation setting.\" in section 4.3.3. I assumed all figures were percentages since they are labeled \"Ability Score (%)\".\n2. I find Figure 1 inappropriate for a scientific publication. I'm surprised there wasn't something more interesting to put here given page limits.\n\n**References**\n\n1. Baolin Peng et al. \"Instruction Tuning with GPT-4.\" 2023.\n2.

While the paper presents interesting observations, readers are left wanting a deeper discussion to enhance the quality of the paper. \n\n**Novelty Constraints**: It's worth noting that the efficiency of synthetic data has been previously discussed in Gudibande et al., 2023, in their paper titled \"The False Promise of Imitating Proprietary LLMs.\""

One missing reference that also discusses the dynamics of instruction tuning - Dynosaur: A Dynamic Growth Paradigm for Instruction-Tuning Data Curation. Yin et al., 2023. This paper proposes an automatic instruction generation method that can support the dynamic expansion of the instruction-tuning data. Also, it discusses how we can further improve the performance on unseen tasks and avoid forgetting on existing trained tasks, when the instruction data dynamically grows. Moreover, it can be counted as a combination of \"human-curated\" and \"synthetic\" data, since it is based on human annotations but instructions are generated with machines."

The abilities being investigated are not some superficial abilities of the models, mostly involve reasoning. Therefore, I doubt whether 1k is enough for each ability.
