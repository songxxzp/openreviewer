But are these conditions sufficient? Is there any theoretical justification for that?\n2. The clique-sampler tries to sample for as many as possible hyperedges. Will it not affect the size of hyperedges being predicted?\n3. The performance of the proposed method is not very different from the baselines on hypergraphs where the average hyperedge size is large. Is there any justification for that? Also, from the predicted hyperedges, is it possible to provide a stratified evaluation to understand how the proposed method works on large vs small hyperedges?\n4. Can you think of a real-world scenario where converting a graph to a hypergraph (where we know that there are underlying group interactions) is essential, and this approach can help?\n5. Apart from clique-based projections, there are other hypergraph projection methods, such as the node-degree-preserving method[4]. Can this approach recover hyperedges from such projected graphs?\n\n\n6. I request the authors to provide justification for the following.\na. In the Introduction section, whether the hyperedges are observable or not actually depends on the objective of experiments conducted on the system. For example, protein-protein, gene-gene interactions have semantics defined for pairwise interactions where protein complexes are inherently super-dyadic relations of proteins, and experiments observe them in the protein complex form [1].\nb. Unpublished: True, author-author interaction datasets do not provide the underlying hypergraph structure, but one should go with other bibliographic datasets such as AMiner[2] to get a complete view of the system.\nc. Relevance to the hyperedge prediction problem: The problem of hyperedge prediction is actually relevant. The hyperedge prediction methods consume a hypergraph as input, and the right way to see it is every graph is also a hypergraph (more precisely, 2-uniform hypergraph), and the methods [3] where a set of candidate hyperedges is not used can identify underlying hyperedges. Especially when you are using the sample hypergraphs from a given domain, methods like HPRA can generate new hyperedges using the known hyperedge degree distribution.\n\n\n[1] \"Hypergraphs and cellular networks.\" PLoS computational biology 5.5 (2009): e1000385.\n[2] https://www.arnetminer.org/\n[3] \"HPRA: Hyperedge prediction using resource allocation.\" Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Web Science. 2020.\n[4]  \"Hypergraph clustering by iteratively reweighted modularity maximization.\" Applied Network Science 5.1 (2020): 1-22."

In particular, the authors identify two necessary and sufficient conditions for the recovery of the hypergraph from G: (1) the lack of any \"nested\" hyper-edges, and (2) the lack of any \"uncovered triangles\" (Thm 1). Moreover, when (2) is not satisfied, the reconstruction accuracy using maximal cliques can be exponentially small in the number of hyper-edges (Thm 3). \n\nThe second main contribution is a learning-based approach that leverages side information in the form of same-domain hypergraphs to reconstruct a hypergraph from its projection. The method follows a 4-step procedure. First, the distribution of hyper-edges within maximal cliques of G is computed for the training data (the known hypergraph of the same domain); these are denoted by the $\\rho(n,k)$'s. Using this information, cliques in G are sampled  in a way that is optimized for the $\\rho(n,k)$'s and a query budget (since the total search space is very large). Finally, cliques are classified as hyperedges or not based on the local structure of the cliques with respect to the surrounding graph. The methodology is assessed on a variety of datasets with favorable results."
