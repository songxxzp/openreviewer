This is because RRT* using collision checking modules and the RRT* is guaranteed to find a feasible path if it exists (proven in original RRT* paper).

Equation 6, 7, 8 simply ignores this term and combines all the conditional scores. Which one is actually used?\n\n- 1b: If Line 7 of Algorithm 1 is the one that is actually used, it differs from the papers (Equation 9 of [1]), in the sense that there is no subtraction by the unconditioned score. Why does the author choose such a form? Isn't this wrong if applying Bayes' theorem with Equation 10 from [2]?\n\n- 1c: Still about Line 7 of Algorithm 1: Why does the unconditioned score use $E_{\\theta}^1$? What is special about $E_{\\theta}^1$ compared to the other $E_{\\theta}^i$?\n\n2. About the theory side of the compositionality: \n\n- 2a: The basic assumption for Equation 10 from [2] to work is that all the conditions must be conditionally independent. Wouldn't this assumption be violated in this paper's experiment settings? For example, as a scenario mentioned in the paper, if C1={o1,o2,o3,o4} and C2={o3,o4,o5,o6}, will C1 and C2 still be conditional independent?\n\n- 2b: Even the conditional independent assumption holds for t=T, for the intermediate t, is such an assumption still guaranteed, especially the distribution of $x_t$ now is actually affected by these conditions?  \n\n3. About the experiment settings:\n\n- 3a: What is the representation of the dynamic obstacles? Is it a vector consisting of the configurations from all timesteps in the trajectory?\n\n- 3b: Since the dataset is generated from BIT*, why not compare it as a baseline?\n\n- 3c: A general impression of the diffusion model is that it takes a long time to generate samples. Why is the planning time here lower than the other baselines? Does the planning time also include the sampling time of the diffusion model and the finetune time? Is there any additional optimization you did to speed up the process?\n\n- 3d. For the real-world dataset, is it possible to evaluate the model's success rate systematically (like overlap on pixels)? It is hard to parse the normal controller and the model's performances solely from images.\n\n- 3e. What is the timeout condition for the planning? \n\n- 3f.

                "value": "The paper proposes a potential field motion planning approach which uses score matching to learn energy functions which represent the attractor and repulsor potentials. The potentials are then combined via simple summation, producing a velocity policy where trajectories can be rolled-out. The method is pretty straightforward, and the paper easy to follow. The paper demonstrates the applicability of the method on pedagogical examples. \n\nMy main concerns with the paper is as follows:\n\n1. The introduction states that potential field methods have \"fallen out of favour in recent years\", this is not quite true, as reactive motion generation approaches, notably Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs) (Ratliff, 2018) and Geometric Fabrics (GF) (van Wyk, 2022) are in effect potential field methods. RMPs and GFs are highly sophisticated frameworks, capable of composing potentials defined on multiple task-spaces, and combine each potential according to a weighting metric. This is in contrast to the simplistic approach proposed in this paper, which simply considers potentials in the same task space, and then naively sum everything together. \n\n2. Score-matching learns energy functions where the parameterised function's gradients match the target function, however, the energy function values themselves can be very different. This makes directly summing the potentials very unsound. What if the energy values of one obstacle is higher than that representing another obstacle?\n\n3. SDFs are ubiquitous in robotics, and can be thought of as a potential that increases as one moves away from the surface of the obstacle. What would be the motivations of learning a potential to represent the obstacle when ones could build an SDF, which can model complex scenes very efficiently, and use that as the repulsor? \n\n4. The obstacle potential should not be in the C-space, it would be much easier to be constructed in the workspace, as it depends on the geometry of the workspace. However, the attractor potential is defined in the C-space. It is unclear how you combined these via simple addition."
