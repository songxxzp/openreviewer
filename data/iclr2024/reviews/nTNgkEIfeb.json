There definetely exist works that look into data extraction from the global model, but from the perspective of a malicious aggregator that can use techniques like providing inconsistent models. For example: Boenisch et al. (arXiv:2301.04017), Pasquini et al. (CCS'22), Zhao et al.

On the one hand, it is presented as an attack, on the other hand as an evaluation framework => is it supposed to be something that also FL operators should utilize to measure whether real benign clients might be vulnerable to such attacks?\nAlgorithm 1 is also unclear in this respect: Do all clients run the attack in parallel (instead of a small subset of malicious clients pretending to be benign)? The set Q_t is not passed to the FedInverse function as a parameter but assumed to be a global variable in line 19; however, the function still explicitly returns it => make clear what is the purpose of this algorithm, what is the final result of the algorithm, and how values are passed around between the functions.\n\n**Update:** The authors have appropriately addressed my concerns in the rebuttal and provided a revised version of the paper.

However, the setting is not practical for the typical situation. As the number of participants increases, some clients will have similar data distributions, so that FedInverse may fail in this setting.\n- Moreover, FedInverse generates the image from a similar distribution with target clients. However, it could not tell the source of the image exactly (from an attacker or another specific participant).\n- Some metrics used in the experiments should be clear. Take the attack accuracy as an example. A well-trained model may still classify an image with some flaw as the correct class, and it could lead to results at variance with reality. Additionally, the top-5 accuracy is too weak for some experiments, especially on MNIST (with only ten labels). As for FID, the attack results of some baseline approaches(for example, applying the MI attack on local models) should be added for comparison. Otherwise, it would be hard for readers to understand the degree of privacy leakage.     \n- In Section 3, the description of the attack procedure is not clear enough. More details are needed."

Many settings where FL is helpful\u2014such as medical images across hospitals [1]\u2014are often where the data distributions aren\u2019t covered by publicly available data.\n\n[W2] The experiments can be improved in terms of both quality and quantity.\n\n- The paper directly takes a split of the federated training set as the \u201cpublic data\u201d for training the GANs. This in-distribution nature weakens the experimental support for the proposed techniques.\n- The evaluated datasets are fairly small; there are large federated dataset such as iNaturalist [2] that would help make the results more convincing. Indeed, by looking at Figure 4(a), the reader may argue that the model-inverted examples do not look much alike the true examples; what happens if the dataset and the FL setup is scaled up (e.g. more clients, larger local batch sizes)?\n\n[W3] The evaluation metrics can be made more rigorous.\n\n- The bulk of the experimental results rely on having a good \u201cevaluation classifier\u201d which tells apart real vs generated (model-inverted) images and whose embeddings are good enough to give meaningful Frechet inception distances (Section 4.4). However, it is unclear how such a classifier was trained.\n- The core issue is perhaps that the possible plausible deniability that the model-inverted images are indeed part of the training set. I.e. just because the evaluation classifier says the generated images are realistic, can we be sure that they actually are? Is the similarity provable?
