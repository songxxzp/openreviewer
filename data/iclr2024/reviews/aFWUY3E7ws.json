                "value": "The work proposes Global-Local Identification and Prediction (GLIP) for time series forecasting. The proposed method moves away from deep learning (often transformer-based) methods, instead utilising lightweight approaches that can be run on a CPU (system identification and Fourier transformation). This has the further advantage of making training time (mostly) independent of the prediction horizon. In an evaluation over four datasets, GLIP shows improved performance for both MSE and MAE compared to seven other methods."

Additional analysis of percentage improvement for MAE would be helpful (potentially in the appendix).   \nQ2. I have a small concern regarding data leakage from the test set. I believe the test batch information is only used for local prediction (constructing the storage basis), but in Figure 1 there is an arrow going from the test batch back into the global prediction (predicted length). Could the authors please verify that there is no data leakage that would affect the global prediction/overall results."

It also outperforms other Transformer-based methods by a large margin.\n\nOverall, it integrates knowledge about the challenges in time series forecasting (concretely, incorporating global and local aspects of time series datasets). This is further highlighted by additional design decisions like extracting local basis functions, through a prediction-data weighted input time series to mitigate outliers and data-variations. \nAn ablation study stresses the importance of each of the designed components and justifies each aspect of the complex model design (Fig 1).\n\nIn my opinion and after reading the method and appendix carefully, I see this as an excellent paper that demonstrates how to obtain state-of-the-art results in an orthogonal way to mainstream Transformer deep-learning approaches recently proposed.\n\nWhile the overall presentation is complete, well justified, and technically sound, the language seems over complicated at places and could/should be revised. For instance, the sentence \n> \"The parameters \u039e, procured through the sparse identification process, exhibit the capacity to signify the intensity of latent cycles and the magnitude of inter-variable influences. By virtue of these parameters, a more profound comprehension of the model can be attained. \"\n\ncould be rewritten in simpler (and more understandable) English by\n\n> \"The parameters \u039e indicate the cycles and magnitudes between variables, which can be used directly to interpret the model.\"\n\nSimilarly, pointing to individual panels in Figure 1 while describing the method would also greatly support the understanding of the method.\nThe current version describes the process in text and just references the figure as a whole."

Is \\Theta_g includes exactly three items or multiple sin/cos waves? (this question also applied to Section 3.1.2)\n\t* \"from the univariate predictions with the test set\" - should probably be the training set?\n\t* X^*_g is not really used in Eq. (3), different from the text. Also, not clear what order of expressions were considered.\n- Section 3.2: it is not clear to me if this is part of the model/training or a description of how to validate the model's performance (e.g., the paper mentioned it is used to \"evaluate\" or \"conduct an assessment\")?\n- Overall, I think the paper would significantly benefit from a pseudo-code describing training and inference procedures.\n\nOne significant weakness is related to interpretability. The paper positions the proposed approach as an interpretable approach (including the title of the paper and in the motivation described in the abstract). However, the paper presents no results on interpretability in the paper and there is only a short description that says that the parameters are \"amenable to interpretation\". To make strong claims regarding the interpretability of the proposed approach, some results are needed (i.e., what are these parameters, are they weights associated with interpretable features, how many are there, etc). Some example(s) for the interpretability of results would be very useful as well.\n\nExperiments:\n- Datasets: the number of datasets used in the paper seems significantly smaller compared to comparable works. For example, in [2] and [3], other datasets such as weather, electricity, and traffic were included.\n- Global prediction is presented as an advantage of the proposed approach, but without any baseline, it is very hard to judge whether the results we observe are good (e.g., in Exchange and ILI where the predicted patterns deviate from the ground truth). It would be useful to include some time-series forecasting baseline so that we can get a sense of how well the proposed approach is doing by comparison.\n- Reproducibility: missing details as described above (e.g., the construction of \\theta_g). In addition, the chosen values for the hyper-parameters (e.g., \\alpha, \\beta) are not described (as well as the procedure of tuning them).\n\nLiterature: the work should probably mention other models that have focused on basis expansion, such as N-BEATS [1].\n\nMinor issues:\n- Section 3: \" in the testing set for global prediction\" -> should be training set?\n- page 6: \"prediction. we aim\" -> \"prediction. We aim\"\n\n\n[1] Oreshkin, B. N., Carpov, D., Chapados, N., & Bengio, Y. (2019, September). N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting.
