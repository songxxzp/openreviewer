These are two orthogonal changes, and the Transformer seems to have much more performance impact than the swap function itself. Yet, the paper focuses mostly on the swap function.\n- The method uses both the soft and the hard sorting network for training. Also, Tab 15 shows that training with $\\lambda = 0$ has basically no effect on the quality of the trained network. As the standard deviations are not shown, it is unclear whether there is any effect here, but $\\lambda=1$ seems to hinder accuracy. This begs the question if the Error-Free Differentiable Swap Function has any contribution to training, or just during inference, in which case there is no need for the straight-through estimator. It would be worth evaluating the baseline Optimal Diffsort with hard min/max during inference, to see this.\n\nBased on the 2 points above, I'd like to see two sets of experiments:\n- the best optimal diff sort models with identical transformer architecture to those of the Error-Free DSF\n- The same architecture as the best Error-Free DSF with \\lambda=0 (thus, being equivalent to using hard min/max during inference, but being trained as \"Diffsort Optimal\")"

They show how incorporating an attention based part in the architecture is the better choice for sorting large sequences of data, since it provides a way to incorporate the entire sequence of data to sort and contextualize the output for each sample."

                "value": "- Overall, while interesting, the applicability of the method seems limited at first glance, since one can in principle learn the function that maps samples to ordered objects first and then perform the sort using standard methods. I believe that the authors should either better motivate the need for this sort of method, or demonstrate in their experiments why learning the ordinal value directly does not perform as well.\n\n- I think there is a gap in the proof of Proposition 2. Namely, the fact that the soft minimum and the soft maximum are the same as $k \\to \\infty$ seems like it is missing a step in how it is derived. I believe that it should hold, given the differentiability of the function, but filling in the missing step here is needed.\n\n- I believe that certain parts can be improved with respect to the clarity of the paper. More specifically:\n\n  - It seems to me that the paper assumes that the function used to soften the maximum is the sigmoid, and some of its properties are listed in Section 2 - however, it is not clear if the sigmoid is the only choice, or if these properties are sufficient for a function to satisfy. I would appreciate it if the authors could clarify this point.\n\n  - Again in Section 2, I had some trouble understanding the wire-based construction of the permutation matrix, especially since the associated Figure is in the Appendix. I believe that the point of the authors would be clearer if they moved the Figure in the main paper, as well as simplify the explanation for the construction (saying, e.g., that each wire is a step to fix a single wrong ordering, and iterative application of these steps results in a sorted set).\n\n  - I believe that Figures 1 and 2 can be simplified / combined, since they are essentially showing similar things - namely, that the function is error-free, which is not surprising given that it is not softened during the forward pass.\n\n  - In Section 7, the paragraph \u201cUtilization of Hard Permutation Matrices\u201d is not very clear to me. I would appreciate it if the authors could rephrase the point they are trying to make here.\n\n- As a minor point, in Section 6, the authors should rephrase how they refer to previous works, for example: \u201cThe work (Petersen et al., 2021) has suggested \u2026\u201d -> \u201cPetersen et al. (2021) have suggested\u2026\u201d.\n\nOverall, I think this is an interesting work, but I believe that the authors should improve upon the clarity of the paper and the motivation of their technique."
