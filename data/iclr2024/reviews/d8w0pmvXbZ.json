This may be a valid point, although it is not very how to mitigate this problem, and it is hard to be completely convinced that this is *the* reason for instability of large transformers. That being said, some of the experiments are valuable and help us a little bit to understand some issues that may arise in the training of transformers. There is an emphasis on considering the learning rate size. \n\nThe suggested experimental evidence supporting this claim is \"val loss vs learning rate\" curves. However, (1) there is no surprise in training divergence when lr becomes too large, and (2) I do not see any experimental evidence that divergence is indeed caused by the considered instabilities and not by something else.\n\nThe paper also studies how \"learning rate sensitivity\" is affected by certain design choices. Learning rate sensitivity is defined as the average of \"excess val loss\" over learning rate range. However, the choice of particularly this metric does not seem well-motivated. Do authors use uniform distribution over lr? If yes, why not uniform over log(lr)? Why not simply use maximal stable lr?\n\nOne insight which seems useful is that default eps=1e-8 in AdamW might appear too large and cause updates to vanish."

The central contribution is the reproduction and analysis as small scale of instabilities that were previously observed on large-scale models. This allows to study the stability of those models without needing the large computing power required for large-scale training.\n\nTwo central kind of instabilities are studied by the authors: the growth of logic in attention layers, and the divergence of output logits of the model. In both cases, it is experimentally shown that those instability can be reproduced on small models when using a large learning rate, and that the mitigation techniques that were developed for large models are equally effective in this context. The core tool used for this analysis is introduced to be the measure of the sensibility of the model performance to the learning rate used for the optimization, and the experimental results show that those mitigations tend to reduce that sensibility, stabilizing the training.\n\nThe authors finally extend their analysis to study the impact of several other interventions that have been proposed, such as the parameterization of the trainable weights, the integration of weight decay in the optimizer, the scaling of the model size and the use of warm-up periods."
