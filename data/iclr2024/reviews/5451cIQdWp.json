For example, the information bottleneck part seems strange to me at first glance. Maybe the authors can elaborate more on how information bottleneck is related to the main findings and claims and conduct a more fluent transition between (sub)sections.\n* **Novelty.** Using the distilled dataset for better efficiency in pruning has already been proposed in previous literature [1], which weakens the novelty and contribution of the proposed method. Therefore, the efficiency cannot be a main claim. And I think the whole novelty of this paper is weak.\n* **Lack of further evidence.** Information bottleneck is a good perspective to understand the distilled datasets, but I think the paper lacks further evidence on how information bottleneck is related to the findings. Concretely, how the information bottleneck is quantized? I think the loss landscape is not a direct aspect to show the point. More direct and intuitive evidence is needed.\n* **Lack of implications to practices.** Knowing the fact that pruning on distilled data is not new in this paper, the author should provide more insights on how the findings can guide applications and practices.\n\n------\n[1] McDermott L, Cummings D.

The largest part of the paper is dedicated to the description of the process of data distillation, while that is not the contribution of the paper (existing distilled datasets are used for the experiments). \n\nThe discussion about information bottleneck is largely misplaced in this work. The initial idea of IB is that a deep learning model implicitly tries to learn a representation that keeps maximal possible information about targets and minimal possible information about inputs, thus forming a bottleneck. It is still not proven that such compression is needed for generalization and that deep neural networks indeed perform it. Moreover, a natural conjecture about using a data that is already optimized in terms of information is that the model (neural network in this case) does not have to learn it anymore. Meaning, that from the initialization its task is simplified significantly, it basically does not have to form a bottleneck in itself. The empirical evidence in this paper is supporting this conjecture directly (especially with the observation that for more complex datasets there is no effect of smoothing barriers). I see the analysis of direct differences between sparsity masks induced by distilled data and natural data and analysis of them as an important experiment not performed in this paper. As well as the exhaustive comparison between the performance of synthetic masks should be one of the central and most discussed results, but it is reduced to one diagram in the paper. \n\nMinor:\n\n- please make use of \\citep and \\citet to distinguish citations that are not part of the sentence and part of it correspondingly\n\n- in section4 there is a mention of \"architectural relationship of the data\" - it is completely unclear what does this term mean\n\n- diagram in Fig.7 is very hard to understand. Why only 60 and 87 sparsity are chosen? Why the barrier is always same for IMP setup? What is performance ratio? Why IMP baseline is only one no matter that there are several setups?\n\n- I think the first sentence of Discussion does not belong to the text\n\n- the flatness investigation is left out to the appendix, nevertheless it is mentioned as one of the conclusions for the paper. There is no clear connection in general in the existing research between LMC and flatness, so the conclusions are inaccurate."

Moreover, the IB framework lacks experiment or theoretical analysis which cannot convince me firmly. \n3. The Sec 5.1 seems to be redundant. The LMC experiments can already give a clear conclusion over the stability of subnetworks. I don't see a large advantage to include such fancy visualizations in the main text. \n4. Some figures seem to be non-informative (e.g., Fig 1 right part and Fig 2). There is no need to explain the dataset distillation and IMP with both texts and figures. This part can be put into a \"background\" section but no need to explain in such a detailed manner. The audience can be assumed to be people who are knowledgeable in these fields and the effect of including these figures is to lower the informativeness of this paper.\n5. The writing of this paper sometimes makes me lost. There are many \"therefore\" in this paper, but most times when \"therefore\" occurs there is no clear causal relationship between the sentences before and after. Some expressions are vague, e.g., the \"important\" in \"...What is deemed \"important\" for real data might not be important for distilled data; therefore, distilled pruning may attempt to remove these....\" (P. 5). Also, some expressions are actually wrong, e.g., \"Linear paths or Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) is an uncommon phenomenon that only occurs in rare cases...\" and LMC is not a rare phenomenon but happens with both spawning case and permutation case [cite 1].\n[cite 1] Samuel Ainsworth, Jonathan Hayase, and Siddhartha Srinivasa.

In the last paragraph of Section 5.1 (on page 8), it is mentioned, 'We see the trained models fall into two separate minima in both the IMP and Dense cases, explaining the loss barrier in Figure 4.' This seems to connect stability with the loss landscape. If I understand correctly, the linear path for stability and loss landscape are different.
