It makes sense that when the conditional distribution is skewed, using a symmetric confidence interval is not an optimal choice, yet the missing part of the argument is, why the QRF loss is an optimal or better choice? Say, under what distribution shape will the QRF be preferable? The current theoretical evidence only supports that QRF is consistent in a marginal sense (which is weak), but it doesn't show the advantage of the QRF over other methods as claimed. For the numerical experiments, the synthetic experiment is a bit special, while the real-data experiments didn't include many other calibration methods, but only those quantile regression-based ones. \n\n3. The loss function seems to add an additional non-convexity because of the cross term of the product $\\mu_l\\cdot \\mu_u$.

The improvement over the existing approaches is basically marginal. \n  - More importantly, the improvement in the width of the intervals might be due to the regularization term on the interval width. It seems that the same regularization can be naturally applied to QR and WS. Hence, the comparison may not be fair. \n  - The above statement can also be seen from Table 2. For the skewed distribution, the proposed QFR fails to outperform QR; only the QFR-W with the regularization outperforms QR. \n  - It does not make sense to strikethrough the case when the coverage probability is higher than the nominal value. For example, it seems to me that, in Table 3, QR performs much better than the proposed method in yacht data, as the width is roughly the same while the coverage of QR is much higher with a smaller standard error. \n\n2. The essential idea of this paper, as well as some competing methods such as SQR, WS, and IR, is to put different weights on the different sides of the intervals. For example, if a distribution is skewed to the right, it is desired to include more data points on the left of the median in the interval to reduce the width. However, as shown in Figure 2, the proposed QFR-W intervals are narrower than the QR intervals on both sides. Can the author explain why this happens?\n\n3. The name of the proposed method is slightly confusing. The new method basically uses a new loss to estimate the quantiles, so it is not really quantile-free. Also, the main purpose of the quantile regression is to estimate quantiles, and constructing intervals is typically seen as a byproduct. Can the proposed method directly be used to estimate quantiles? If not, it is not appropriate to claim the method is a direct replacement for quantile regression."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Why is it important to report the minimum width interval of a distribution? What practical purpose does it serve to a decision maker who is served with these intervals? The minimum-width intervals come at the cost of losing interpretability on what each end-point constituting the interval means \u2014 why is it meaningful to pay this cost? For e.g. in Fig 1a, symmetric intervals convey the following facts: the probability of the random variable to exceed $\\mu_h$, probability of the random variable to be lower than $\\mu_l$, and that probability of falling within the interval $[\\mu_l, \\mu_h]$. Whereas in Fig 1b, we only know the probability of falling within $[\\mu_l, \\mu_h]$. Doesn\u2019t this convey much less information to a decision maker that makes use of these interval estimates?\n2. Following the point above, is it possible to know _which_ quantiles do the predicted interval endpoints $\\mu_l$ and $\\mu_h$ correspond to? This could then partially alleviate the aforementioned limitation.\n3. An alternative approach to predicting confidence intervals is to regress to all quantile levels at once, as the authors also noted. Then one can present the smallest interval among all, post-hoc. The authors mention that the limitation of this approach is that SQR [Tagasovska and Lopez-Paz, 2019] performs poorly and thus limits its utility. Recently there have been other approaches [1, 2] to regress all quantiles at once. I encourage the authors to consider evaluating these approaches.\n4. *Evaluation methodology.* Firstly, the results suggest that the suggested QFR method results in relatively marginal improvements compared to the trivial baseline QR, and other baselines. This does not fully support the claim of the paper that symmetric intervals are worse than asymmetric ones, as one needs to sacrifice the interpretability of the intervals (see point 1), for very little gain in the interval width. Secondly, and more importantly, I find it concerning that many results in Table 3 were in strikethrough because the coverage requirement is not met. In order to fairly compare two uncertainty estimation methods, it is important that both methods have the same marginal coverage. For example, consider the dataset $\\texttt{energy}$, QFR-W has 89.87% coverage and 0.13 width, and QR has 98.31% coverage and 0.18 width, how can one claim that QFR-W is better than QR? One way to carry out a fair comparison is by employing conformal prediction\u2013based wrappers [3] that guarantee marginal coverage, then it is possible to compare different methods in terms of interval width, while they obey the same coverage requirements. Otherwise I am afraid that the comparisons in this table do not fully make sense.\n\nOverall, I found the idea of regressing to the intervals directly via the modified pinball loss clever  and interesting. However, I believe addressing the above points clearly is important for the paper to reach its full potential. I encourage the authors to consider my suggestions.\n\n\n[1] Brando et al., Deep non-crossing quantiles through the partial derivative, AISTATS 2022. \n\n[2] Rosenberg et al., Fast Nonlinear Vector Quantile Regression, ICLR 2023. \n\n[3] Romano et al., Conformalized Quantile Regression, NeurIPS 2019."
