Though the results are more complicated in the case of ViT and ResNet without weight decay, they suggest that this is an area that merits further investigation."

For example in the MNIST and CIFAR examples, the number of parameters is much larger than the number of datapoints for most of the examples, but the gap does not develop until well into this regime. I have listed some questions about this phenomenology below; I believe some more detail on this point could make the paper significantly stronger.\n\nUpdate: After significant engagment by the authors in the review period, some of the weaknesses have been addressed, and I updated my review score."

What is the evidence that the models in the experiments are distinct in their level of overparameterization? What fraction of them are reaching interpolating minima? How close are any of the settings to the NTK regime?\n\nOne interesting experiment could be to train a networks with a fixed number of parameters, but which is closer to or further from the linearized regime (using techniques from [1] and [2]), with and without SAM, and seeing if SAM is more helpful in the linearized regime or not. This could provide another insight on whether or not overparameterization itself is the cause for the differences in effectiveness.\n\n[1] https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/hash/ae614c557843b1df326cb29c57225459-Abstract.html\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07344"
