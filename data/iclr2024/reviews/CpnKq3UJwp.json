            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There are several major weaknesses of the paper.\n\n1. The empirical validation of the method is very weak.\n    1. Despite the authors proposing the method to tackle large action spaces and mentioning the 27m_vs_30m settings as a motivating example in Section 3.2, there is no experiment in these large action space settings.\n    2. There\u2019s a lack of experimental validation beyond the SMAC benchmark, and the same benchmarks settings are used across all results and ablations. For example, Google Research Football and Multi-agent MuJoCo would be candidates for other tasks.\n    3. The SMAC benchmark is outdated and should be replaced by the SMACv2 benchmark, as many tasks have been shown to be trivially solvable due to the lack of stochasticity in the SMAC benchmark.\n    4. The baselines used are relatively few compared to other published MARL works. There should be comparison with other recent methods like MBVD, RODE, CDS, etc.\n    5. It\u2019s not clear how many seeds the work used for the main Table 3. The work mentions 3 seeds for followup ablations, but this is too few to ensure that the performance is not due to luck. The results should be reported across at least 10 seeds.\n2. To my knowledge, the search-based component of methods like MuZero are very reduced and not significantly useful for many non-board game tasks. For example, while MuZero utilizes a large search depth for Go, it uses a very small search depth for Atari, which raises the questions of how much performance gain the search component contributes. This work mentions that it uses 5 unroll steps, which is still very small. For MCTS-based works like this one, there should be empirical investigations with respect to the number of unroll steps at both training and test time to see whether search is offering any benefits.\n4. As this work mostly treats multi-agent decision problem as a single-agent RL with a very large action space, the authors should demonstrate $OS(\\lambda)$ and AWPO more extensively on (single-agent) decision problems with large action space; indeed, the author could even solely consider these single-agent settings rather than bringing in the multi-agent SMAC benchmark at all. The single-agent bandit experiment in Figure 1 is too simplistic and insufficient to demonstrate the authors\u2019 point. Also, in very large action spaces, MCTS with a limited budget (e.g. $N = 100$ MCTS simulations as considered in this work) seems very sparse and unlikely to simulate the same action multiple times from a given state. This would significantly weaken the motivation for $OS(\\lambda)$, which relies on simulating each action many times from a given state. In such large action spaces, a very relevant heuristics baseline is to sample $N$ simulations (each starting with a different action) with the learned policy and simply follow the action given by the best simulation. Overall, there's insufficient experiments demonstrating that $OS(\\lambda)$ and AWPO solve the stated large action space problem without suffering from unintended side-effects of the additional optimism, and there should be more trivial heuristics baselines which may also work well for searching large action spaces with a fixed budget."

These standard practices have not been followed and I believe weaken what could be a strong case for the effectiveness of these algorithms.\n\nNo discussion is given to hyper parameter tuning, or the choice of hyperparameters for the baselines that MAZero is being compared against.\n\nOn a stylistic note, the paper has a lot of grammatical typos and needs to be gone over thoroughly. An LLM should be able to pick up all of these mistakes.\n\nI would not use the word \"ingenious\" in the abstract to describe your own algorithm, or, as later used \"audacious\".\nCTDE is not spelled out the first time it is mentioned.\nThe different loss terms in equation 2 are not spelled out.\nIs Figure 1 a single seed?
