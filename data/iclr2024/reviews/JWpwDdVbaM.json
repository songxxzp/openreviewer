ARM consists 3 modules: Adaptive Univariate Effect Learning (AUEL), Random Dropping (RD) training strategy, and Multi-kernel Local Smoothing (MKLS).  AUEL is for adaptively estimate mean and variance and capture temporal pattern for each series; RD is for robust learning and avoid overfitting when series are interdependent; Multi-kernel Local Smoothing (MKLS) for capturing various temporal dependency among series.  ARM demonstrates superior performance on multiple benchmarks without significantly increasing computational costs compared to vanilla Transformer."

It attempts to address previous inferior performance of transformer models compared to a simple feed forward neural network DLinear(Zeng et al. 2022) in long term forecasting task. It proposes unique insights on temporal pattern learning of the output sequence distribution and interdependency among univariate series.\n\nQuality: The quality of the paper is high. The proposal of the three core modules are well motivated. AUEL is for adaptively estimate mean and variance and capture temporal pattern for each series; RD is for robust learning and avoid overfitting when series are similar; Multi-kernel Local Smoothing (MKLS) for capturing dependency among series. The authors have performed experiments on 10 benchmarks which are diverse enough to contain different aspect of multivariate time series. The authors also incorporate different ablations by incorporate one or two modules of ARM. \n\nClarity: the overall clarity of presentation is good. It is motivated by the drawbacks of current sota models and address issues one by one by proposing the modules of ARM.\n\nSignificance: the paper can be important to time series learning community."

The authors claim the proposed approach will not significantly increase computational costs. But such discussion/analysis is not included in the paper. \n\nClarity: I found MKLS block in section 3.3 difficult to follow due to notations. The authors introduced many (subscripts and subscripts of X for example); it would be nice to refer to somewhere. \nTable 2 contains large amount of results which are replicate of Table 1. Maybe the authors can eliminate some and find a way to better present them? \nFigure 3 & 4. Due to large amount of information in Figures 3&4, when introducing the components such as MKLS block, I think it will be great to introduce pointers to these components in the figures.   For example \\tilde{X}^{*i} need pointers to point to in Figure 3."

Could the authors explain in what sense the notion of causality is embedded? \n4.\tI am confused about the how Multi-kernel local smoothing helps capture temporal dependencies among different series due to notations. For example, What is X_j. Could the authors elaborate more? \n5.\tThe paper demonstrates superior empirical performance for forecasting task.  It is hard to see how significant the improvement is compared to other recent models such as PatchTST and DLinear. Do the authors have some insights on the sensitivity of hyperparameters in ARM module in the tuning/training process since many learnable hyperparameters are introduced. \n6.\tWhat are the complexity/runtime compute/memory to incorporate these modules in the vanilla model? How does that compare to PatchTST and DLinear?  \n7.\tA few discrepancies regarding Table 1. I found in the original PatchTST paper on traffic datasets Table 3: for MAE,  0.249 for L_P = 96, 0.256 for L_P = 192, different from 0.239 and 0.246 in this paper. Could the authors double check if they are consistent?"
