Also, on the dataset of Enzymes and Grid, both GDSS and EDP-GNN suffer a lot from the constraints. Furthermore, Figure 12 shows a lot of unrealistic molecular graphs (e.g. very large rings, disconnected graphs, very long bridging bonds) with the constraints on atom count.\n2. The proposed projection paradigm main only applied to constraints with simple calculation process so that the optimization problem has a closed-form solution.

My biggest concern is whether such an operation, which pulls the embedding towards the designated constrained space through projection during the reverse process, is effective in more practical scenarios. The paper proposes some compromises to determine whether to pull towards the original data distribution or the constrained space during the reverse process. However, from the experimental results, I find that the performance of this approach is not entirely satisfactory. For example, in the Community-small and Ego-small datasets, the MMD metric worsens in many cases after applying the PRODIGY method. Additionally, in the QM9 molecular generation experiment, adding PRODIGY poses a significant risk of decreasing validity and novelty. \n\n2. Another concern I have pertains to the potential impact of such operations on the convergence of the Langevin Dynamics process. It would be prudent to provide a proof for the convergence of the Projected Inexact Langevin Dynamic/Algorithm follows some ideas from PSLA [1]. \n\n3. I also have some concerns regarding the practicality of the proposed method. From the projection operations summarized in the paper, the proposed method seems more suitable for controllable generation for atomic features X or structural information A related properties, such as valency, atom count, and molecular weight. However, in real-world applications, such as constrained molecular generation, we mostly expect the generated molecules to exhibit certain graph-level properties. \n\nMinor:\n\n4.
