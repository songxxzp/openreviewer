                "value": "This paper introduces a novel approach to 3D molecule generation for structure-based drug design using diffusion models. Recognizing the inconsistency in existing diffusion models that incorporate protein-ligand interaction information predominantly in the reverse process, the authors propose the Interaction Prior-guided Diffusion model (IPDiff). IPDiff integrates geometric protein-ligand interactions into both the diffusion and sampling processes. The methodology involves pretraining an interaction prior network (IPNet) using binding affinity signals, followed by leveraging this network to adjust molecule diffusion trajectories (termed \"prior-shifting\") and enhance the binding-aware molecule sampling process (referred to as \"prior-conditioning\"). Empirical studies on the CrossDocked2020 dataset demonstrate that IPDiff can effectively generate molecules with realistic 3D structures that exhibit superior binding affinities towards target proteins, while preserving essential molecular properties."

Even if the noise injection methods remain the same, the original samples' distinctiveness ensures varied forward diffusion outcomes.\n\n3. It's noteworthy that there have been prior studies that learned the beta parameters for forward diffusion. A comparative analysis with those works would add depth to this study.\n\n4. Based on\"Analog bits: Generating discrete data using diffusion models with self-conditioning,\" the novelty of the prior conditioning contribution in this paper appears less significant.\n\n5.

Can the authors elaborate on this? \n- Between equation 10 and 11, the authors mention that they need to approximate X_0^M and V_0^M (since we dont have access to ground truth during generation). How bad is this approximation? How much performance is lost because of this? Would it be possible to do some experiment to analyse it?\n- Based on the results on the tables of this paper, the proposed method has better metrics than the reference.
