                "value": "## Summary\n\nThe paper presents an extension to the [MACE](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/4a36c3c51af11ed9f34615b81edb5bbc-Paper-Conference.pdf) model by adding a matrix power layer to ensure the positive semidefinite (PSD) nature of the output tensor. Although the idea of maintaining PSD properties might be of value, the paper's contributions are incremental at best. Most notably, the claim about \"high-order rotational equivariance\" is not an original contribution but belongs to the original MACE model. The paper severely suffers from a lack of organization and clarity in writing. Hence, I recommend a rejection of this submission.\n\n## Detailed Comments\n\n### 1. Lack of Definitions and Citations\n\na) The term \"edge shifts\" is used without a definition or reference.\nb) The suffix 'lb' used in the context of training methods is not defined.\nc) Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients are mentioned without proper citation.\nd) On page 17, there are numbers in parentheses next to \"Young's modulus,\" \"shear modulus,\" and \"Poisson's ratio,\" without any explanation.\n\n### 2. Unclear Illustrations and Descriptions\n\na) The paper claims that energy conservation equates to a PSD tensor, but this is tucked away in a footnote. This claim needs to be explained in the main text.\nb) The choice of the optimal 've' method, which is squaring matrix A, is not mentioned until late in the results section. This should be mentioned in the methodology section.\nc) Only absolute errors are presented without giving the context of ground truth magnitudes or relative errors. It's unclear for the readers to know if this method is accurate or not at all.\nd) It's unclear if Figure 1b is a plot for ground truth or predictions.\n\n### Flaws in Finite Element Method (FEM) Introduction\n\na) The paper mentions that FEM has \"~10^9 elements\" but does not state the computation time for such a scale. Furthermore, GNNs cannot handle such scales on a single GPU, making the comparison unfair. Instead, try to report a wall time comparison between your method and FEM for the same dataset.\nb) The statement that FEM ensures force equilibrium is incorrect; it is the underlying PDE that ensures this.\nc) Similarly, FEM itself does not ensure PSD properties; this is ensured by the constitutive model.\nd) The paper incorrectly claims that FEM is rotationally equivariant. Special treatments are needed to achieve rotational equivariance in FEM.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe paper presents an incremental extension to the MACE model with a focus on preserving the PSD properties of the output tensor. However, the paper lacks clarity in writing and organization, and its contributions are limited. As a result, I recommend a borderline reject for this submission.\n\nThe authors can also consider a workshop or journal submission that focuses on this area.\n\n##\nAfter rebuttal, I think the writing quality and the motivation has been more clear. Hence, decided to improve to 6."

About this, here are some questions:\n     - a) To maintain the equivariance of the total model, we must ensure each layer in such a model is equivariant. But for the PSD-layer, the PSD matrix $A$ is based on $M$, which is created by arrange $n(n+1)/2$ entries of the output of an equivariant model.\n        - **i**. Is it an equivariant operator to arrange $n(n+1)/2$ entries to get $M$?  This requires a formal mathematical proof.\n        - **ii**. Is it an equivalent operator of the function $\\rho$ to turn $M$ into $A$? In the end of Section A.2.2, \u201cIf the overall model had been equivariant with respect to vectors in $U$, it will remain equivariant after eigenvalues are made positive\u201d is not trivail, it may also require a formal mathematical proof.\n         - **iii**.\tFor now, we assume that the previous question (function $\\rho$ is equivariant) has a good proof. It is necessary to discuss whether this design will reduce the representational capacity of the entire neural network. Assume that this neural network is a bijection (we consider an equivalence class divided based on different perspectives as an input. But the function $\\rho$ may not a bijection, e.g. $(\\pm \\Lambda) ^2$ will get a same result. The Wigner-D based network build a faith representation of the group, but the induction of function $rho$ will lead to an unfaith representation, it requires more analysis. For example,  an analysis for the increased stiffness-based errors of CGC+ve, NNConv+ve, and MACE+ve in Table 1 may be a manifestation of the decline in the ability of network representation.\n    - b)\tLet assume the PSD-layer is equivariant, there are some questions about the experiments:\n        - **i**.\tIn Section 3 (Related Work) and Section 5(Conclusion), Finite element (FE) modelling is mentioned, but the experiment could not find the data comparison (e.g. time cost or accuracy) between your model and FE.\n        - **ii**.\tMore powerful baselines should be discussed, especially the geometric GNNs like TFN[1], NequIP [2], SCN[3], GMN[4], SE(3)-Transformer [5]. \n3.\tHere are some possible typos and recommended symbol modifications:\n    - a)\tAlmost all the inline formulas in the article lack punctuation at the end.\n    - b)\tIn Section 2.1, the rotation of the stiffness tensor $R_{ia}R_{jb}C_{abcd}R_{kc}R_{ld}$ may be better to generalize to $n$-th order tensors with the format of changing bases of a tensor($ R_{ia}R_{jb} R_{kc}R_{ld} C_{abcd}$).\n    - c)\tIn Eq.
