Section 2.2 says \"The symbols S can be either learned parameters of the model or nonparametric positional embeddings.\" How is S different from a positional embedding then? If S is unique per token, even if the token is a repeat of another token value-wise, then S is essentially a positional embedding. If S is unique per *value* of a token (ie all tokens of value v have the same s_i), then doesn't S implicity encode the value of the token?\n- If the outputs of an abstractor layer are \"abstract states that represent purely relational information\" (section 2.3), then how are features associated with objects passed along/learned in models that use abstractor layers? In all the examples presented in Figure 2, abstractors are used in conjunction with regular encoders. How can you ensure that the abstractor is learning meaningful information and that all the \"information flow\" does not happen through the encoder layers in parlalle setups (architectures c, d, and e)? \n- Section 4.1 claims that the authors hypothesize that \"the ability to model relations as multi-dimensional is also the reason that the Abstractor can learn the order relation better than ...\" Are there any experiments to test or verify this hypothesis? The paper also makes many claims about an information bottleneck in S, but there is no analysis on what is actually learned in S.\n- Is there an ablation on model size? The baseline transformer is not very large, but it may be that a smaller transformer can learn with fewer training data points, or a larger transformer may converge faster.\n- The experiments seem to be on simple problems with small models. Simple problems may not necessarily be an issue since they are relatively diverse problems, but it would be nice to see larger, more complicated problems. For example, the partial order task training set is small enough that one could consider using in context learning with a large LLM, which may offer comparable performance."

                "value": "The motivation of this paper lies in addressing the challenge of relational and abstract reasoning. Contemporary deep learning models excel at tasks involving semantic and procedural knowledge, but their abilities to infer relations, draw analogies, and generalize from limited data to novel situations remain limited. The popular Transformer architecture, through its attention mechanisms, has the capacity to model relations between objects implicitly. However, these standard attention mechanisms often create entangled representations, blending relational information and object-level features in a way that is not optimal for efficient learning of relations.\n\nThis paper proposes a new variant of Transformers, named the Abstractor. The core of the Abstractor is a variant of attention, named relational cross-attention. Compared to the vanilla attention in the Transformer, relational cross-attention disentangles the object-level feature and relational information by replacing the value vector in vanilla attention with a learnable symbol vector or positional function, which is independent of the object-level feature (X). The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their Abstractor through \"pure relational\" and \"partial relational\" tasks, and compare the Abstractor to previous architectures designed for relational tasks."

The proposed Abstractor, a novel variant of the Transformer model, disentangles relational and objective features through relative cross-attention. \n\n3. The authors have proven, through comprehensive experiments, that the Abstractor is more sample-efficient than the vanilla Transformer and previous architectures used for pure or partial relational tasks."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The overly constrained setting limits the significance of the work. The authors conduct experiments under two settings: \"purely relational\" and \"partially relational\". As per the authors' definition, \"purely relational\" implies that object-level features are extraneous and that the statistics of relation/order are already sufficient for solving the task. This is an extremely restricted setting and may not fully represent the complexity of real-world tasks where both relational and object-level information are often important. The authors use math problem-solving to represent the \"partially relational\" setting, but the math problem here is arguably more relational/symbolic than object-level. It seems like the math problems here can be solved by symbolic rules.\n\n2. Scalability is one of the most significant advantages of Transformer architectures. The performance can increase with the model size and data size. Given that the Abstractor is a variant of the Transformer, it's essential to determine whether the scaling law still applies to the Abstractor. From the results provided, the performance can outperform the vanilla Transformer when the data size increases from the 1000 - 5000 range. But what about using more data and a larger model size? Will the Abstractor consistently improve and outperform the Transformer?\n3. Why did the authors choose to replace value vectors with input-independent vectors, while keeping the query and key vectors the same (Q -- X, K -- X, V -- S)? Would not the configuration (Q -- S, K -- S, V -- X) also disentangle object-level features (x) and symbolic vectors (s)? To me, the latter one is more intuitive: the relation weight R_{ij} between i, j is represented by the inner product of symbolic vectors, and then object-level features are weighted by R_{ij}."
