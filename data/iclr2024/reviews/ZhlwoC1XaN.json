Dirichlet conditions are handled in the model. Cell types are handled via learned cell type embeddings.\n- The network is based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). The network architecture employed in the diffusion model extends the U-Net framework into the 3D domain, incorporates a transformer (after 4 level of down-sampling) to enable global communication across the simulation domain.\n\nExperiments\n- The paper provides a new 3D turbulence dataset, consisting of 45 simulations of an incompressible flow in 192 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 48 grid cells.\n- 9 out of 45 samples from the dataset are used to validate the method. From the results, the proposed method is able to generate realistic 3D-flow samples that can capture the turbulent flows caused by unseen objects.\n- The paper proposes metrics for evaluating the quality of the generated flows by utilizing properties of fluids, including turbulent kinetic energy, marginal velocity, vorticity and pressure distribution, and the location of the strongest turbulent vortices.\n- The method is compared with two autoregressive models (Turbulent Flow Net and DilResNet) and each with two different settings to convert them to generative models, showing good performance compared with them."

In the litterature several methods have been proposed to tackle the problem from different points of views but the proposed solutions are either expensive/ intractable in practice or are very complex to set. In this work, the originality of the work is in its simplicity of usability while providing good turbulent flow results in a raisonnable time. Hence, the proposed model is scalable.\nMoreover, it is based on a generative model (diffusion model  DDPM) that has achieved significant leaps in a wide spectrum of applications. Augmenting DDPM with physics constraints like Dirichlet enables generating 3D turbulent flows of good quality. The strength of the proposed model is related to the fact it learns a manifold of turbulent flow states without being tied to the initial flow state.\n\n2/ Quality:\nThe methodology of the proposed work is rigorous. A targeted 3D turbulent flow dataset is generated specifically to assess the capabilities of the proposed generative turbulent flow model in the appropriate conditions. Moreover, data and task dependent metrics are introduced to evaluate to the model in physical way.\n\n3/ Clarity:\nThe paper is very clear and simple to follow. It is well structured."
