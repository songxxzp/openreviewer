This one together with Weakness #1 above are the major concerns from my point of view.\n3. There was some discussion on the cost to perform Laplace approximation when introducing Fasher. However, there is no empirical results that support it.\n4. The ablation study (LLLA vs LA) is also from the [1]. Only comparing LA with Last Layer LA is not very convincing on where the uncertainty comes from.\n\n[1] Erik Daxberger, Agustinus Kristiadi, Alexander Immer, Runa Eschenhagen, Matthias Bauer, and Philipp Hennig.

The proposed Laplace-LoRA seems to be a scalable solution to enable uncertainty estimation for large models.\n\n- **Good experiment design**: Despite some practical issues (see *weakness*), the experiment was conducted well on six public datasets with several strong baseline methods, in terms of three settings -- 1) early stopping, 2) finetuning with validation, and 3) OOD generalization.

It would also be interesting to compare the proposed method with semantic uncertainty [Kuhn et al., ICLR'23]. \n- **Lack of LLM backbones**: The empirical evidence of the proposed method is somewhat weak due to the lack of more LLM backbones. Some concerns include: 1) can the proposed Laplace-LoRA work with larger model sizes (e.g., 13B, 70B)? 2) Can Laplace-LoRA be applied to models other than LLaMA2 (e.g., Mistral 7B, GPT-2, etc.)?\n- **Comparison to ensemble**: Besides the checkpoint ensemble, it is also expected to implement a baseline given by the LoRA ensemble (similar to the deep ensemble approach)."
