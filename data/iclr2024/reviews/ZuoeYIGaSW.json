Specifically, the only difference is the contrastive loss adopted by TACO and the triplet loss adopted by Premier-TACO. The technique of negative sampling is quite common in the area of metric learning and widely adopted in applications other than robotics, e.g., face recognition. Moreover, the empirical comparison with the baseline TACO is very limited in this paper. The effectiveness of simply adding negative sampling is questionable.\n\n2. The authors repeated several times the infeasibility of adopting visual foundation models (such as those trained on ImageNet or Ego4D) in sequential decision-making tasks. However, it is ungrounded. The authors should evaluate these models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, EgoVLP, etc.) on the same benchmark for comparison.\n\n3. The model adopted in the paper is quite small. The pretraining is only performed on synthetic data and also small-scale. The practicality of the method needs further study."
