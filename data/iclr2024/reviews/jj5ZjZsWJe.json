                "value": "The paper delves into the challenge of minimizing the objective, which is defined as a finite sum of smooth, and potentially non-convex, functions within a Federated Learning setting. The primary focus is addressing the significant workers-to-server communication costs arising in a centralized distributed framework, which involves one main server and multiple nodes. The authors' contributions can be summarized as:\n\n- They present a novel formulation of the foundational SCAFFOLD algorithm, which effectively cuts uplink communication expenses by half. This lays a more straightforward foundation for integrating communication compression.\n- The SCALLION algorithm is introduced, leveraging the new SCAFFOLD formulation combined with unbiased compressors.\n- The SCAFCOM algorithm is developed to facilitate biased compressors in Federated Learning via local momentum. Convergence analysis for standard contractive compressors is provided.\n- It is demonstrated that both SCALLION and SCAFCOM either match or surpass the communication and computation complexities of current compressed FL baselines.\n- Through experiments, it's evident that SCALLION and SCAFCOM deliver performance akin to full-precision techniques, boasting compression savings exceeding 100x."

SCAFCOM improves communication complexity by a factor of 1/(1-q) over the prior art;\n- Both SCALLION and SCAFCOM exhibit robustness to heterogeneous data and partial participation, unlike existing approaches;\n- The paper provides a principled way to integrate communication compression into federated learning through the new SCAFFOLD formulation;\n- Algorithms are simple to implement and empirically achieve significant compression savings."
