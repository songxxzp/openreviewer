In particular, whereas previous works primarily focused on attack related to the graph and feature information, the current work focusses on attacks on the weights and biases of the GNNs. Inspired by work on (progressive) Bip Flip Attacks (BFA) on CNNs, the impact of such attacks on the accuracy of GNNs is explored. The work on progressive bit search by Rakin et al (2019) serves as additional inspiration. Furthermore, the authors leverage the characterisation of the expressive power of GNNs in terms of color refinements and tree unravellings. \n\nAt the core of the proposed method lies the observation that harmful bit flips should destroy injective at all layers of the GNN. This results in so called Injective Bit Flip Attacks (IBFA) for short."

Because unlike vanilla CNNs or transformers, GNN models especially GINs are usually small. And users usually train a new model on their specific tasks. So I doubt whether such an attack's influence and whether such an attack is worth exploring.\n2. I think your analysis can also work for graph injection attacks or modification attacks. Then why these models can work well by only attacking the CE loss? Could you please use your theory to discuss why graph injection attack can work well and traditional bit flip attack cannot?"
