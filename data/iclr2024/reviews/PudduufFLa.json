                "value": "A method to learn features representations of geographical data observed on the Earth's surface is presented.  The method is based on intrinsic neural fields, using spherical harmonic functions for the positional encoding, combined with SIRENs which adopt sine non-linearities as periodic activation functions (the spherical harmonic embedding can of course also be combined with other neural networks).  It is also shown that SIRENs can be see as a form of learned Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) positional embedding.  A number of experiments are presented, across synthetic and real-world problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of the representation for machine learning tasks, typcially classification.  The proposed method demonstrates an improvement in performance over existing techniques."

Grattarola & Vandergheynst do not specifically consider the sphere and spherical harmonics, instead focusing on graph representations, but consider an emedding based on the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian.  Koestler et al. consider general manifolds, with an embedding based on the eignenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.  On the sphere, these eignerfunctions are specifically the spherical harmonics.  So an embedding based on spherical harmonics as presented in this article is not new, although in this work the embedding is combined with SIRENs and extensive experiments on the sphere are performed.\n\nOne limitation of the proposed approach is that it is limited to very low degrees L on the sphere, typically L of 20 or at most 40.  The spherical harmonics are precomputed analytically, which while fine for these very low degrees will not scale to higher degrees.\n\nIt is indeed the case that combining the spherical harmonic encoding with SIRENS typically gives the best performance (see Table 1).  However, in many cases the improvement is not that substantial, compared to the next-best method.  The improvements for the ERA 5 dataset appear to be more marked."

As in, is the extra computational cost associated with using SH worth bearing with a higher number of polynomials in terms of gain in performance for L > 20?

                "value": "# When are the performance gains from SH worth it?\n\nWhen using FCNet or SirenNet (which is not much of a burden in practice), the gains from SH are fairly small (<1%). The gains from SH are only large when using a low-capacity network. Similarly, in Figure 4(a) we see that the difference between $L=10$ and $L=20$ is only significant when using low-capacity networks. To me, this seems to suggest that \"expressiveness\" is the main issue. From a user's perspective, does it matter whether the expressiveness comes from the input encoding or the network? What's the difference in computational efficiency between SH + SirenNet and X + SirenNet where X is another high-performing input encoding? What's the best argument (combining computational efficiency and performance) that SH is worthwhile to use as a component in a real system compared to the alternatives? \n\n# What is the trade-off between performance and efficiency? \n\nGenerally speaking, the \"take home\" efficiencies of the different methods are not clear. Figure 5 shows the computation time required to compute SH under different implementations, but the important thing is the trade-off between performance and computational efficiency. E.g. is SH + Linear faster than SH + FCNet? This would be very helpful for evaluating the practical usefulness of SH. \n\n# Isn't network capacity and degree of fit a significant confounder in the experiments?\n\nFollowing on from the previous point, FCNet and SirenNet are \"typically\" implemented with a certain number of layers. I might have missed it, but how many layers does SirenNet have in this work? Are FCNet and SirenNet matched in this sense? Do they behave differently as the capacity of the networks increases? What is the effect of training duration / how well the network has fit to the training data? These factors seem very important for comparing the results for these two networks, but I do not see them discussed in the text. This makes it difficult to evaluate key claims in the paper."
