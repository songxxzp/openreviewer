In such a sense, it is unnatural that this paper does not discuss anything about DRO.

The authors mention several times \"feasibility'' and \"robustness'' when introducing the significance of group irregularity issues in shift explanation and motivation, but the formal definitions of these two terms are not introduced until Section 3.4, which may lead to confusion about these two terms. I think it would be better if the authors discuss in detail about \"feasibility'' and \"robustness'' in the introduction and motivation parts. Further, Figure 1(a) (Figure 3(a)) is not clear in illustrating the group irregularities and GSE's solution compared to Figure 1(b) (Figure 3(b)).\n\n2. GSE rectifies the group irregularity issues by simply extending the optimization of PE to optimizing the worst-group PE. Such idea for tackling subpopulation shifts has already been proposed in [1], though it is not designed for shift explanations. Therefore, the idea of GSE is not very novel. Further, the authors only provide theoretical analysis in a simple 1D setting to illustrate the existence of group irregularities. Regarding the proposed GSE, there is no theoretical justification for why GSE generates a more feasible and robust shift explanation while maintaining group structures than the existing methods. It would be better if the authors could provide further theoretical analysis.\n\n3. GSE assumes that the group information is known in the training data, which is hard to satisfy for most real-world scenarios. \n\n4. The authors did a great job of introducing the works related to explaining distribution shift and worst-group robustness. However, for the works related to domain generalization and adaptation, it would be great if they could discuss connections between domain generalization and adaptation and shift explanations.\n\n[1] Sagawa, S., Koh, P.

As GSE requires pre-specified groups in the training data to perform worst-case optimization, I wonder how to select the proper feature that divides the group. In the paper, it seems that using unactionable features (e.g., sex) might be an option. I wonder if the authors could discuss further how to divide data into groups.\n\n3. It is known that group imbalance (irregularity) will make the empirical risk minimization models learn spurious correlation, which is vulnerable under distribution shifts. Therefore, leveraging worst-case optimization can mitigate the spurious correlation issue. As GSE also utilizes worst-case optimization to rectify the group irregularities, I wonder if spurious correlations also cause infeasible or vulnerable shift explanations. It would be great if the authors could discuss further the connection between spurious correlations and feasible and robust shift explanations."
