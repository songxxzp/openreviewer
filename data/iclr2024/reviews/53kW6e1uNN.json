In particular, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the over-correlation problem, which has been largely overlooked in existing works. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, the paper establishes a proportional association between the over-smoothing issue and the over-correlation issue, shedding light on their interconnected nature.\n\nTo tackle these issues, the paper proposes a model-agnostic constraint with adaptive weights. This constraint is designed to effectively mitigate over-smoothing and over-correlation problems in GNN-based collaborative filtering. The adaptive weights allow the constraint to dynamically adjust and optimize the learning process.\n\nComprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed constraint. The results demonstrate significant improvements in overall performance, enhanced training efficiency, and the efficacy of the adaptive approach. These findings provide strong evidence for the practical benefits of the proposed constraint in addressing the over-smoothing and over-correlation challenges in GNN-based collaborative filtering methods."

Indeed, while over-smoothing has been debated in graph-based recommendation for quite some time now, the authors claim over-correlation is still not properly analysed as happening in graph representation learning. Through an initial empirical study, the authors demonstrate that the negative effects of the two issues seem to be directly dependent and go along with the performance degradation of the models (i.e., usually after the third message-passing layer). After that, the paper underlines how over-smoothing and over-correlation may present a direct mapping to rows and columns in the node embedding matrix, respectively, and mathematically proves that the two are proportional. In this respect, as alleviating one of the two would tackle also the other, the authors propose a loss function named adaptive feature decorrelation, that comes into a static and dynamic version. An extensive experimental setting comprising four recommendation datasets and nine baselines demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach. Indeed, when applied to existing graph-based recommender systems, the adaptive feature decorrelation loss function is beneficial to improve the performance in terms of recommendation accuracy and requiring much less epochs to reach convergence. Finally, an ablation study justifies the soundness of the proposed architectural choices."
