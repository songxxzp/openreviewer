It explores this phenomenon through representation learning, considering both model weights and in-context samples. The findings show a strong link between the quality of in-context representations and learning performance. A well-developed in-weights component enhances in-context learning, suggesting it should be foundational. Besides, a simple Transformer, using pattern matching and copy-paste for in-context learning, matches complex models assuming perfect in-weights. These insights offer new perspectives for enhancing in-context learning abilities."

                "value": "In this paper, the authors explain in-context learning in Transformers. They break down learning into two components: in-context and in-weight and introduce two probes to investigate these components. The in-context probe measures how well the model predicts the correct factor in a task sequence, while the in-weight probe assesses how well the model learns the overall task. To investigate this empirically, they use a synthetic dataset where an image of a 3D shape is given, and the model predicts one of six factors.  They evaluate the effectiveness of probes by look at its predictions on model trained on four different dataset variations. They find that (1) the in-weight component is effective with a fixed mapping between factor values and labels; (2) The in-context component is effective with randomly shuffled mappings, and in-context learning from random mappings generalizes to fixed mappings; (3) Switching from fixed to random mappings accelerates in-context learning; (4) Training on a mix of fixed and random mappings is more effective than training on each individually. Overall, the authors observe a strong correlation between the in-context component and  in-context learning performance and also that in-weight component influences in-context learning but is not sufficient. Furthermore, they show that a  constructed Transformer model with perfect in-weight component matches the performance of a trained GPT2 model, highlighting the importance of the in-weight component for in-context learning. Lastly, they suggest that two-mechanisms used by the constructed transformer - pattern matching and copy-paste - might be the mechanisms underlying in-context learning in larger models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs)."

Given that in-context learning involves numerous classification tasks with shared inputs but varying labels, a more holistic approach considering all these tasks is necessary to capture the complete in-weight component.\n3.

However, the in-context component is clearly also impacted by concepts learned in the weights. It also already seems obvious that one would need to be able to achieve a high in-context comp score in order to achieve high in-context accuracy. For example, I fail to see what we learn regarding the second major claim \u2018in-weights comp plays a crucial role in learning the in-context comp\u2019. I am confused about (1) why this is surprising (2) if it is surprising, which of the experiments justifies this. I could see 6A potentially supporting this, but there are other factors at play. In 5, one trains from scratch so clearly there is some \u2018warm up\u2019 that is needed to get in-context learning ability.\n- One of the other fundamental pieces of the results is training on D_fix and then evaluating on D_rnd or some variation of this. I am concerned that the conclusions that are drawn from these experiments are not necessarily results of in-context learning properties but are just generally issues related to distribution shift. After all, the transformer is not trained on D_rnd. The trend of the results is the following: when we use D_rnd in training, the results get better when evaluating on D_rnd (Fig 5, 6). Is this somehow unexpected?\n- Given this, perhaps the most surprising result is that the in-weights scores on 5A with D_rnd are poor and 6A does not improve to what is achievable training full on D_rnd, but only the in-context score improves. I\u2019m not sure what to make of this though. For instance, this could be explained by saying that it just may not be important to form a representation that is predictive of the factor values without the context for this particular task since the task can be inferred from the context. Perhaps the authors can shed some light on that."

Throughout the intro and early parts, it is clear what th paper wants to do, but it\u2019s difficult to discern what quantifiably one wants to measure since \u2018in-weights components\u2019 and \u2018in-context components\u2019 are sort of nebulous terms until one reaches section 2.3. Honestly, I don\u2019t know the best way of presenting it, but I just want to raise this as a potential issue for future readers in case the authors have alternatives.\n- when you compute the in-context comp score, are you using the very last element of the sequence at L?\n- when producing the probes, are you doing a train and test split and are we looking at the test accuracy. How is this split being done? Are we looking at the test score when we look at the plots?\n- FYI I don\u2019t think E is defined before being used in Section 2.3.\n- Fig 6A should be D_fix->rnd not D_rnd->fix I think.\n- Fig 6A why is it D_rnd^fix => D_fix and not D_rnd^fix => D_rnd? Isn\u2019t it more relevant to understand the in-context score on D_rnd?\n- In, D_rnd^fix, do you use twice the amount of data as D_rnd? That is, does each epoch contain twice the data or are they both halved so the total is the same?\n- I don\u2019t really understand the last paragraph that starts with \u201cComparison with previous work in analyzing the in-context learning mechanism.\u201d\n- It would be helpful to compare 6A directly with 5B since they are plotting the same kind of results. It seems that in both you get good performance starting at roughly the same epochs. This I think supports my question about how much of this is just attributed to distribution shift: once you start training on the same data as you test on, performance improves.\n- Some typos: \u201ccopy-past\u201d \u201cfead forward\u201d \u201cHow transformer solve this problem?\u201d \u201canalysis is to analysis\u201d"
