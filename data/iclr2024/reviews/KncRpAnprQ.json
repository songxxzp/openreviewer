In experiments, they compared various stochastic methods, which I cannot find in this paper. This unfair comparison causes a false contribution.\n\n\n[1] Yang, H., Wang, M., Yu, Z., & Zhou, Y.

This typically indicates some issues with the underlying evaluation [1].\u2028\n\n2.\tEvaluation on Black Box Attacks: Interestingly, the paper does provide an evaluation on the black box Square attack, which is considered to be a strong black box attack. However, the evaluation is subject to concern, as the performance barely dips below the benign performance after attack. A simple test to check any problems with the evaluation would be to intentionally inject adversarial examples and check if the performance is still retained [2].\u2028\n\n3.\tCode for the method and evaluations: Since the authors report stunning performance increases, in light of the above concerns, it would be easier to believe the claims if well documented code would be provided for each of the evaluations.\u2028\n\n4.\tWriting: The writing is loose and informal in some parts of the paper.\n\t1.\tP3: Step 1: What is mean, std?\n\t2.\t\u201c$\\delta$ is a uniform one\u201d -> \u201c$\\delta \\sim {\\rm Unif}([0, 1])$\", etc.\n\t3.\tSec 4.3: It seems that the adversarial examples are generated for one realization of the network, and tested on another.
