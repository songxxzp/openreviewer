The paper presents how guided stochastic exploration can be used in a grow and prune approach to train an always sparse neural network with some amount of empirical performance. The paper presents an approach to do guided stochastic exploration using subset sampling, wrapped in the overall \"cosine decay\" strategy of decision making. The cosine decay strategy is well known for having some form of, \"explore-exploit,\" baked in. Empirical validation and comparisons to related work in the field is presented. Some vague connections to actual neural networks in human brains is hinted at."

As deep learning is a practical and engineering field, it is not really known what is the value of showing improvements in big-O format, when actual implementation of these approaches are in super huge networks such as ChatGPT, GPT4, Diffusion Models, and many other productionized models. There are open source minified models of the above as well that can be run on a desktop or a laptop. The reviewer believes that there are no practical benefits of this approach in that setting either.\n\nIf the paper should be acceptable as a theoretical work due to the potential of its' contributions being useful in the future, then the authors have not shown sufficient novelty compared to the many other related works that are cited within the work. The technical tools used to deliver improvements are rather well known with obvious applications to this problem. If the paper is meant to be in a theoretical setting, what model of computation should be used to analyze its claims?\n\nThe paper does not consider over wall-clock time analysis in any of its thinking. If the procedure itself of guided stochastic exploration takes longer than the theoretical speedup in FLOPs gained by the sparsifying, then, then any benefits of the proposed approach is moot.\n\nThe paper considers sparsifying weight connections, it is well known that this cannot, in practice, deliver any actual improvement on massively parallel SIMD architectures used in deep learning today. Sparse general matrix-matrix multiplies are known to be, more or less, impossible to speed up in SIMD setting where the actual observed wall-clock time speedup is anywhere close to the theoretical speedup indicated by FLOP reduction. There are several peer reviewed works exploring this problem.\n\nThe connection between artificial neural networks and actual neural networks in the brains of living creatures is not well thought out, I will cover this in more detail in the \"Questions\" section of the review."

Could the authors make that argument iron-tight and clear before it is considered under the peer review setting?\n\nIf the purpose of this paper is to connect the field of Artificial Neural Networks with \"biological neural networks\" in brains of living creatures, could the author expound on this greatly? One place to start would be how actual neurons in actual brains having spiking activity called spike trains, and don't behave much like artificial neural networks at all. Spiking neural networks are also a good place to start on this path.\n\nIf it is the case that this paper is an exploratory, prototyping work for some other future work based on the findings of this research work, do the authors believe that it is sufficient to meet the bar for peer review?"

Introduced **GSE** is based on RigL and only augments it with a connection sampling strategy and use of sparse gradient for determination of the new active connections. \n\nWhile the value proposition of the method is the training of large-scale models that cannot fit onto consumer or high-end GPU, experiments in this work are done at small scale, amenable to researchers and practitioners with limited compute power. The potential advantage of the method could be in reduction of the FLOPs for backward pass, but the baseline RigL requires materialization of dense gradient only on update steps, done typically every 100\u20131000 steps. Thus, the computational savings are minor.  At this scale, a method allowing for higher exploration of sparsity masks is likely to get better performance [1], [2] for a given target sparsity and training time. \n\nSome more recent works with always sparse training managed to significantly outperform RigL. Powerpropagation+Top-KAST [3] and ITOP-RigL [4] have noticeably better \nnumbers for 90% sparsity on ResNet-50 while adopting the same training procedure. \n\n*Minor*.  Notation for $f^{[l]}$, $g^{[l]}$ is confusing. $h_l$, $g_l$ - denote a scalar value - norm of the weights / gradients for a given layer, where $1$ is a vector of all ones with length - `(num_layers,)`. And there is expression in the denominator $1^T |h/g^{(l-1)}| 1$ that would imply, that \n$h^{(l)}$ is a matrix of size `(num_layers, num_layers)`. I think it would be better to write sum over $l$ in the denominator.\n\n---\n[1] Peste, Alexandra, et al. \"Ac/dc: Alternating compressed/decompressed training of deep neural networks.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 34 (2021): 8557-8570.\n\n[2] Kusupati, Aditya, et al. \"Soft threshold weight reparameterization for learnable sparsity.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

Importantly, the same pruning and growth criteria are retained from previous methods.\n\n1.2 Regarding the distribution methods employed for sampling, the use of gradient-based distributions appears to contradict the proposed efficiency enhancement. This is because these distributions also require the computation of the full gradient, resulting in a complexity that is identical to RigL [1]. Furthermore, these distributions do not yield any performance improvements over RigL [1], indicating their relatively inconsequential role in this study.\n\n2. Marginal improvements\n\nThe improvements observed in the results are rather modest, typically falling within the range of 0.1% to 0.5%, thus demonstrating limited practical significance.\n\n[1] Utku Evci, Trevor Gale, Jacob Menick, Pablo Samuel Castro, and Erich Elsen.

The existing experimental results seem to suggest that a $\\gamma$ value of 1 outperforms RigL (where $\\gamma$ approaches infinity). It would be valuable to discern at what point the performance begins to decline for specific $\\gamma$ values and provide an explanatory analysis in this regard."
