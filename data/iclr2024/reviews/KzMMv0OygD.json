The meta-training set is further used for training two LMs, one for generating instruction, input, and output given documents, and the other for evaluating the generated content as a bi-classification problem. Experiments are conducted both in-domain and out-domain using the collected 270k samples with Llama2-7B and indicate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Also, a comprehensive analysis of automatic and human analysis is done to showcase the quality of the constructed *Teg-Instrct*."

This method has almost no improvement in out-of-domain datasets compared to other baselines, and the in-domain experiment is almost meaningless because other baselines are all in the setting of out-of-domain when dealing with the dataset proposed in this paper.
