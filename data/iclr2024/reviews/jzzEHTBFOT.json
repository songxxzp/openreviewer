The main messages I took from this paper are (1) this work pointed out the calibration error issue for test-time prompt tuning of VLMs, (2) provided an analysis on the relations between prompts and calibration error, (3) this work found the correlations between text-feature dispersion and calibration. Although the analysis is interesting and novel, it is not comprehensive enough. It would be interesting to know whether training-time prompt tuning also suffers from calibration error. If so, does the proposed method work for training-time prompt methods. If not, what is the reason. Also, the conclusions are empirical rather than theoretical. It is okay if the method is motivated merely on empirical observations, but the lack of theories decreased the contributions of this work.\n\n- The proposed method is only adopted on TPT method. Do other test-time prompt tuning methods suffer from calibration error? Can the proposed method be applied to other methods? Only one method is discussed is not comprehensive to draw the conclusions.\n\n- This work used 80 hard prompts to evaluate the impact of prompts on calibration error. However, according to the prompts shown in Appendix A.3, some of the prompts are not optimal. For example, \"a black and white photo of a {class}\" is not suitable to colored photos, and \"a sketch of a {class}\" may not work for photos. I am wondering whether the discrepancy between prompts and calibration error are due to the bad choices of prompts. If so, the conclusions about the relation between prompts and calibration error may not be convincing enough."

It then proposes a loss function based on the ATFD to increase the ATFD thus improving calibration during test-time adaptation.
