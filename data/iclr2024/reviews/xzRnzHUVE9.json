In this setup, the authors leverage the fact that, in certain problems, distinct action sequences (starting from the same initial state) can lead to the same candidate solution, and make an additional assumption that, given a certain high reward action sequence, such symmetric transformations can be made easily/efficiently. The authors augment the traditional reward-maximizing training of a policy with a ``symmetric replay training'' or SRT, where the policy is additionally trained to imitate symmetric transformations of high rewarding action sequences. This allow the policy training to be more sample efficient by exploring different parts of the action space without needing to query the reward oracle (since the reward is already known).\n\nThis method is RL method agnostic, and is added to 5 different RL methods (A2C, PG-Rollout, PPO, GFlowNet, REINVENT), and evaluated across 1 synthetic task, and 2 real world benchmarks. In almost all cases, the proposed SRT significantly improves the sample efficiency of the base methods to different extents (in a couple of cases, SRT is unable to improve upon REINVENT)."

                "value": "- How does this RL-based combinatorial BBO solution relate to combinatorial BBO problem handled by Bayesian Optimization schemes such as COMBO [B]? In their case, they would never propose the same solution twice (which is something any RL-based scheme might be producing, and SRT is removing this repetition). And if external information regarding the symmetries between solutions are available, that can be utilized (as is done in this paper) to generate new simulations and/or skip repetitions.\n- Are there any existing literature on RL based BBO that discusses or brings up symmetries between action sequences (not necessarily leverages them)?\n- Isn't TSP a problem where we can get a reward after every action (and the final reward is the sum of the partial rewards)? What happens if we compare the proposed scheme to such a setup with a RL-based solution?\n- Are we looking at symmetric action sequences leading to the same solution $\\mathbf{x}$, or are we talking about action sequences that lead to different solutions $\\mathbf{x}'$ but $f(\\mathbf{x}) = f(\\mathbf{x}')$? The TSP example given on page 3 after Definition 1 seem to fit this latter setup. If it is infact the latter, how does that effect the proposed scheme and the related motivations?\n- How is the shifting related to the starting point? Will a different sequence of actions from the same starting point lead to a solution with the same cycle (and hence value) but different order? I agree that the reversed order does lead to the same solution with the same initial state, but I am not sure about the other scenarios.\n- I am not sure where the 20+% improvement is coming in for PPO+SRT over PPO with K=100k (as discussed in Section 4.1). Table 1 lists PPO at $6.77 \\pm 0.12$ vs $6.71 \\pm 0.02$ for PPO+SRT, which is more like a 1% improvement. Am I looking at the wrong results?\n- In the presence of the symmetry, and the access to symmetric transformations, it seems that we should always see improved sample efficiency (or at least no degradation). Under what conditions might we expect degradation (as we see with 2 cases in Table 3 with REINVENT)?"

I'm not an RL expert so I can't comment on how previous works in RL have exploited symmetries, but at least in chemistry the existence of these symmetries is well-known and has been exploited in prior work (e.g. the paper \"All SMILES Variational Autoencoder for Molecular Property Prediction and Optimization\"). To the authors' credit though, I am not aware of work which has done this specifically for RL methods.\n- At least for molecules, the experimental results are not as impressive as they may seem. A recent paper showed that tuning genetic algorithms actually can achieve an average score of `0.639` on the PMO benchmark, which is a bit better than the results shown in this paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09267). Furthermore, the bolding in Table 3 is a bit misleading: they bold the tasks which achieve the best results just on the methods considered, but not necessarily overall SOTA results on the PMO benchmark. For example, drd2, which the authors bolded with a score of `0.960` is beaten by SynNet with a score of `0.969` (Gao et al 2022).\n\nMore broadly, in my opinion, this paper's contribution only makes sense because RL methods are being applied to non-sequential problems by introducing some sort of artificial action sequence. To me, this suggests that RL is not the right tool for these kinds of problems. However, this is just my opinion and I did not take this into account when deciding my score.\n\nOverall, I think this paper proposes a sensible method which does improve performance, as shown in a well-designed experimental evaluation. However, the idea is somewhat obvious and only applies to a class of methods which I think are not really well-suited to the problem. Putting these factors together, I feel that a score of 6 is appropriate."

To address this, the authors notice that there can be multiple symmetric solutions with exactly the same reward (or cost) (e.g., by shifting the original solution, permuting it, etc.). They then propose symmetric replay training, a technique that consists in replaying symmetrically transformed high-reward samples, so that it can better explore the under-explored regions in the symmetric space. For this purpose, we do not need additional interactions with the environment, as the reward (or cost) function in the symmetric configuration is equal to the original one. The authors experimentally assess their approach on the traveling salesman problem, molecular optimization and hardware design. They find that symmetric replay training consistently improves the sample efficiency, often by large margins."

Since this paper is mostly experimental, it would have been great to assess how the proposed technique performs on top of such architectures that already incorporate the symmetric inductive bias. The experiments with the DevFormer in Table 2 and Figure 6 suggest that we can get additional benefit by applying symmetric replay training on top of such symmetric architectures. It would be interesting to understand if this is generally true with other architectures, too. In particular, even if the policy (and possibly value) networks already incorporate the symmetry in their architecture, is it possible for symmetric replay training to give additional benefit, and why would that happen?\n\n3. The ablation study in Figure 4a is a bit unclear to me. How is it in principle possible to do simultaneous updates, given that we must first collect the high-reward samples in Phase 1? I think the idea of a 2-phase algorithm and alternating steps is inevitable, given that we must fist isolate the high-reward samples before applying the symmetric replay training. The authors could explain this part better to avoid confusion. Did they for example only store the high-reward samples in the replay pool for the simultaneous update, and then performed simultaneous updates once the replay buffer was sufficiently large?"

                "value": "1. Have the authors tried other symmetric architectures besides the DevFormer? Does symmetric replay training on top of symmetric policy and value network yield additional benefit, and why? The proposed technique could complement other ideas such as symmetric NNs, so their combined impact would be interesting to understand.\n\n2. Can the authors explain how simultaneous updates were performed in Figure 4a? Did they first conduct standard RL to fill the replay buffer with high-reward samples, and then switched to simultaneous updates? This was unclear from the text.\n\n3. The paper emphasizes the fact that evaluating the black box function is an expensive operation. However, Table 8 shows that the proposed method can outperform other sample-efficient algorithms such as Sym-NCO in the synthetic settings, where function evaluation is fast and cheap. In that case, it seems that symmetric replay training could be positioned as a general technique for improved sample efficiency that can be used not only with black-box optimization but also more generally. The authors state \"broad spectrum of CO problems and methods\" and \"a new generic DRL method\" in the main text, so perhaps symmetric replay training is positioned as a general-purpose technique. On the other hand, the black-box nature (with expensive function evaluations) is mentioned several times and even in the title. It would make sense for the authors to disambiguate this point and position their method very clearly (i.e., as a general-purpose algorithm or a technique that is better suited for black box optimization with expensive function evaluations)."
