The authors may comment and explain this \"discrepancy\" -- otherwise it seems to be that the abstract is exaggerated. \n\n(2) As the authors pointed out themselves, the analysis is similar to De Bortoli (2022). I understand that the technicality comes from analyzing the \"tangent\" process to avoid $\\exp(T)$ term. The authors may highlight/summary the novelty earlier in the introduction. \n\n(3) In most theorems/corollaries, the authors distinguish \"aggressive\" $\\beta_t = t^2$, and \"conservative\" $\\beta_t$'s (e.g. $\\beta_t = t$). I wonder if there is some \"phase transition\" at exponent $2$ (i.e. $\\beta_t = t^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha < 2$ and $\\alpha = 2$). The authors may comment on this point. \n\n(4) Now all the experiments are deferred to appendix. I feel that the authors may lift some of experiments to the main text.

When $\\tau=1$, it is exactly the well-studied variance preserving SDE in the literature. Because of that, it is not clear to me the advantage of proposing this new VESDE given that it seems to be quite similar to the VPSDE. \n\nMoreover, since it is a small extension of the VPSDE, the paper should be more transparent about the technical contributions. What is the technical novelty and difficulty to extend the existing theoretical works in this field to allow this added parameter $\\tau$. For example, Lemma 13, Lemma 14, Lemma 15 all come from De Bortolli (2022). The authors should make it more clear what is the novelty that arises from this new VESDE.\n\nIt is not clear the advantage of this new VESDE compared to VPSDE or other diffusion models. It would be helpful if the authors can compare the complexity with the existing literature to demonstrate theoretically that this new VESDE can indeed outperform or at least comparable to the existing models. What is more important is the paper lacks convincing numerical experiments. There is only a very small numerical section in the appendix about a 2-dimensional Gaussian distribution, which is not enough to suggest this new VESDE model is promising. Given that this VESDE is just VPSDE with an added parameter $\\tau$, would it be possible for the authors to utilize the publicly available codes from the previous literature to see if it works well? Also, in terms of practice, it seems that it is quite often in the literature people simply take $T=1$. If that is the case, then you get $\\tau=1$ which corresponds exactly to the VPSDE. The point is that without numerical experiments, it is not clear to me why this new VESDE is a good idea, and what advantage it can bring compared to VPSDE."

As a result, more rigorously speaking, VESDE is a Brownian motion with a (deterministic) time change.\n\nOn page 2, \u201cWe propose a new forward VESDE with the unbounded coefficient $\\beta_{t}$ and a small drift term.\u201d It is not clear to me whether this description is accurate. Maybe it is better to say \u201cand a drift term that is typically small\u201d? The reason is that in your model, you can choose $\\beta_{t}=t^{2}$ and $\\tau=T$. Under this choice, when $t$ is of the order $T$, the drift term can be large?\n\nOn page 6, it would be better if you can add some more detail about Assumption 3.
