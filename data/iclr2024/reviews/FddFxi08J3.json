This paper studies the higher dimensional variant k-WL, where instead of nodes the information is passed between k-tuples of nodes. This variant has been associated with \"higher-order GNNs\", a generalization GNNs where correspondingly, messages are passed between sets of nodes. The paper is theoretical and proves some results about the \"WL dimension\" of graph substructures, which is the smallest k such the k-WL test can distinguish between graphs that have a different number of copies of that substructure. The results concern to variants like induced versus non-induced substructures, whether\u00a0the number of copies can be computed, and whether the WL dimension of a substructures can be computed efficiently."

                "value": "This paper studies the power of the k-Weisfeiler-Lehman (k-WL) algorithm for the natural and fundamental task of computing graph motif parameters (a weighted combination of subgraph counts). The motivation for studying the k-WL test is the connection to the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs).\n\nBuilding on recent results for unlabeled graphs, this paper characterizes the class of graph motifs that can be computed by the k-WL test for labeled graphs (i.e., with edge and vertex labels). A central quantity is the WL-dimension of the graph motif parameter $\\Gamma$, which is the smallest $k$ for which a k-WL test returns distinct outputs for graphs which induce distinct values of $\\Gamma$. In Theorem 2, the authors show that the WL-dimension of $\\Gamma$ is equal to the maximum treewidth of any of the subgraphs in the support of $\\Gamma$. In Theorem 6, the authors show that the result of the WL test can be used to compute the value of $\\Gamma$ as well (alone, the $k$-WL can only distinguish between different values of $\\Gamma$). In their final set of results, the authors turn to the more specific question of subgraph counting. Theorem 8 shows that it can be determined whether a labeled graph has WL-dimension at most $k$ in polynomial time. Proposition 9 examines the popular task of counting graphlets, and shows that counting k-graphlets has WL-dimension k - 1."

Together, Theorems 2, 6 and 8 show that one can determine an appropriate value of $k$ in polynomial time for the motif-counting task at hand, and can then compute it using a modification of the k-WL test.

It is known that multiset functions $f$ can be sum-decomposed in certain situations. For instance, [Zaheer et al. 2017] show that continuous permutation invariant functions $f$ from $[0, 1]^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ (which can be viewed as functions on multisets of $n$ elements) can be written as $f(X) = \\rho( \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i))$ for some continuous functions $\\rho$ and $\\phi$. This motivates the common form of \"readout\" functions in GNNs, i.e. permutation invariant functions mapping from $k$-tuple representations to a single representation for the graph. In fact, from previous work I would already expect to see a result like yours; it is unclear whether your result is useful for practical GNNs, since one would already build a readout function in this form.\n\n\nNotes:\n1.
