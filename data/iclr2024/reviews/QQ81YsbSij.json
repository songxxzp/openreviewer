The policy has a very limited action space, and is basically just learning a more efficient way to substitute atoms. I do not see any evidence that the approach could be easily extended/scaled to a more complex action space as described in the future work section, so I am not sure how useful this approach is in practice. The RL approach itself is not very original since it is mostly a straightforward adaptation of CQL. And while I appreciate the effort to generate the dataset with QE, I would have liked to see more details about how the dataset was generated (e.g., which settings have been used and how were failures handled) if this is one of the main contributions of the paper.\n\nThe paper also has substantial flaws in its methodology. First of all, total energy says nothing about thermodynamic stability; instead, energy above convex hull is a much better measure. Secondly, I found the presented baselines pretty weak since they are either random or completely oblivious of the target condition (if I understand correctly). For example, a stronger BC baseline might be to train the policy on only those materials whose band gap values are close to the target condition. Finally, I would have liked to see how the generated crystals look like.\n\nIn terms of presentation, I found the quality of the tables and figures to be quite low. Given that this is an RL for materials design paper, I also would have liked to see a few more references at this intersection. See below for a few examples (however, note that I have not checked all of them thoroughly):\nSui et al. (2021). Deep Reinforcement Learning for Digital Materials Design.\nLaw et al. (2022). Upper-Bound Energy Minimization to Search for Stable Functional Materials with Graph Neural Networks.\nPan et al. (2022). Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inverse Inorganic Materials Design.\nZheng et al. (2022). Designing mechanically tough graphene oxide materials using deep reinforcement learning.\n\nMinor comments:\n- p. 1: \"large and discrete space\" - While the search space in the paper is discrete, the space of all possible materials is not discrete.\n- p. 2: \"in the Materials Project database\" - citation missing\n- p. 3: \"is the is the\" -> \"is the\"\n- p. 3: \"230 having the\" -> \"230 has the\"\n- Table 2: Given that the table does not add much additional information, I would suggest to move this to the appendix"
