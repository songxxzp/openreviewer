This paper theoretically justified the plausibility of formulating the problem as a generative task that is akin to what recent GAN-based EA approach has done. Specifically, for the problem with dangling entities, different from prvious work that has focused on detecting such dangling points, this work proposes a novel solution of entity synthesis. Experiments are done on common datasets shared by most prior works on this topic, with fair comparison ensured (by removing entity names, which has been violated by some prior works)."

For the recently proposed dangling entity problem, a novel solution of entity synthesis is proposed to fulfill the missing targets in the target-side KG. Evaluation has covered the traditional setting of close-space entity alignment to show the effectiveness from that perspective, and a new, plausible setting is proposed for entity synthesis to show the effectiveness from this new angle of solution. The presented method and experiments look sound."
