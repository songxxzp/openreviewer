                "value": "- It is claimed that the proposed losses address that existing approaches \"rely on\n  architectural priors\" for learning objects. In my view that's not true. Slot\n  Attention can be related to soft k-means clustering; the proposed losses enforce more\n  compact and better separated clusters. But what is considered as one cluster (i.e.,\n  an object) is still determined by architectural biases.\n- In my view it is not sufficiently motivated why training unsupervised object-centric\n  models on RGB images is the best approach for improving \"object-based reasoning\n  capabilities\":\n    - Segment Anything (Kirillov et al. 2023) suggests that generalizable object\n      segmentation can be learned from limited supervised data.\n    - Object-centric methods based on contrastive features such as DINO features are\n      very capable, e.g. Dinosaur (Seitzer et al. 2022) or CutLER (Wang et al. 2023).\n      It is argued that it \"limits the applicability of the method to domains that the\n      pretrained encoders are trained on\". The works mentioned earlier however show that\n      the resulting models work well on a range of datasets, including datasets that\n      were not used to train DINO (e.g., MOVi).\n    - Some works show that using additional data, such as optical flow or depth, allows\n      training strong object centric methods (e.g., Karazija et al. 2022). The paper\n      claims that \"relying on [...] optical flow and motion is not feasible since many\n      datasets and scenes do not come with this information\". In my experience however,\n      unlabelled video data is abundant for most practical settings.\n  In summary, it is not clear to me why the restriction to unsupervised, image based\n  methods trained from scratch is adequate for the goal of \"developing object-based\n  reasoning\".\n- Only FG-ARI is used as a metric for quantifying segmentation performance. It has been\n  pointed out several times in the literature that this metric is problematic since it\n  does not take into account whether object boundaries are accurate and favours\n  undersegmentation (e.g., Engelcke et al 2020, Karazija et al. 2021, Monnier et al.\n  2021). More established segmentation metrics, such as mIoU or AP, should be used that\n  do not share these problems.\n\n**Update:** The authors addressed the concerns in the rebuttal. In particular, additional experiments have shown that the improvements by the proposed method are orthogonal to other approaches, such as using contrastive features or videos. I therefore update my rating of this work."

From this perspective the proposed regularization terms can be\n  interpreted as enforcing compact, well separated clusters. In my view the paper would\n  profit from discussing the proposed loss terms from this angle.\n- The Dinosaur model, which is mentioned in the paper, shows improved scalability of\n  object-centric learning to real world data by applying Slot Attention in the feature\n  space of a large scale contrastive model (DINO). Do the proposed regularization terms\n  also improve the Dinosaur model?\n- I would find the result section more natural to read if object discovery came before\n  the experiments on downstream tasks."
