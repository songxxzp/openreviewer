                "value": "This study introduces Wanda, an unstructured pruning method for large language models (LLMs). Wanda utilizes both weights and activations as proxies to estimate the importance of parameters, selectively zeroing out those with low importance. This approach results in a sparse LLM, which can be accelerated with some special devices capable of 2:4 sparsity acceleration. Wanda not only outperforms traditional magnitude-based pruning methods for efficiency but also offers quicker processing compared to SparseGPT, which depends on second-order information."

There are a lot of criteria in the literature of pruning, such as first-order Taylor expansion ($|w*\\delta w|$) [1], and optimal brain damage [2]. It seems that these general methods, with a similar form to Wanda, can be easily adapted to LLM. So, is the proposed $|w| \\cdot |x|$ the optimal criterion, especially in the context of LLMs?\n\n- It would be helpful if the authors could detail the overall speed-up of the entire LLM. Table 6 indeed summarizes the speedup for a single layer. However, an LLM usually comprises various components, including QKV, attention, and linear layers. Since Wanda primarily targets the sparsification of linear layers, it may not significantly boost attention computation speeds. Therefore, the actual overall speedup could differ from the single-layer improvements indicated in Table 6.\n\n- The effectiveness of Wanda on models like OPT and Pythia, particularly under high sparsity conditions (e.g., 50%), seems to be limited. In these scenarios, SparseGPT has even demonstrated superior performance.\n\n[1] Molchanov, Pavlo, et al. \"Importance estimation for neural network pruning.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2019.  \n[2] LeCun, Yann, John Denker, and Sara Solla. \"Optimal brain damage.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 2 (1989)."

While the authors emphasize efficiency, and Wanda indeed greatly surpasses SparseGPT in efficiency (for example, 0.54s for WANDA and 203.1s for SparseGPT when pruning Llama-7b), I would like to question whether this disparity in time consumption truly holds value. My point being, the time expense for SparseGPT also remains quite low. Even though the authors claim the presence of certain real-time scenarios, I believe their notion of training sparse models from scratch is impractical, hence a more thorough discussion is warranted in this aspect."

The paper's introduction of a method to estimate weight importance based on both activation and weights does not appear to be novel. Similar concepts have been explored in previous works on LLM quantization, such as the AWQ work [1]\n2. The pruning method proposed in the paper is simple and straightforward, which can be seen as an advantage. However, it operates under some strong assumptions, such as comparing and removing weights on a per-output basis, rather than adopting a more global pruning strategy. This could limit its applicability and effectiveness.\n3. Given the limitation mentioned in point 2, although the method can be extended to semi-structured pruning, there are doubts about its ability to be extended to structured pruning. \n\n\n\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978"

I believe Wanda prunes the weights of a given layer before computing the activations that will be used to prune the next layer, and the manuscript supports this by saying \"After pruning a preceding layer, the subsequent layer receives updated input activations, based on which its pruning metric will be computed\". I would suggest rephrasing this statement slightly to make it clear that the the \"updated input activations\" are those created by the pruned weights of the prior layer.\n\n2. Is this really an \"element wise dot product\" (page 3), and not a Hadamard product?\n\n3. On page 4, $\\mathrm{diag}$ is used twice, once on a matrix and once on a scalar. I think the usage on the scalar is conveying that we have a diagonal matrix with each entry being the squared $\\ell_2$ norm of the $j$th feature.
