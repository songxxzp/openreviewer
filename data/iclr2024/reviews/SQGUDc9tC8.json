The proposed approach is a significant step toward more interpretable Artificial Intelligence and aims to mitigate social biases without the need for expensive re-training or fine-tuning of very large language models like BERT or RoBERTa. The paper makes an extensive evaluation of the proposed approach and compares it with multiple baselines such as DPCE, AutoDebias, and Union_IG, demonstrating that the proposed approach outperforms them in terms of various bias metrics. Also, I really liked that the paper makes an extensive evaluation, including a large number of demographic attributes as well as modifiers. Overall, I believe that this is a good paper submission, and I believe it can advance research and state-of-the-art methods in mitigating social biases that arise from the use of large language models."

Is this based on the BERT model? I suggest to the authors to clarify this and also discuss if they observe any differences in the presented results for Figure 2 across models. Finally, I would have liked to see a more detailed discussion and explanation of how the authors envision the use of the proposed approaches in other applications beyond social biases and debasing. The authors touch briefly upon this in the Introduction, however, they do not go into details, and it is unclear from a reader\u2019s perspective how the proposed approaches can be applied for other purposes."

Combined with curated prompts that have positive or negative sentiment and are intended to be completed with a demographic group, this method is used to identify neurons in the network that most strongly contribute to differences between demographic groups along different dimensions, including gender, ethnicity, etc. Once these neurons are identified, the paper applies a new technique, Bias Neuron Suppression (BNS), to zero out the activations of neurons that are above a threshold score. The paper shows that when identified bias neurons are amplified, demographic gaps increase, and when they are suppressed, demographic gaps decrease. The paper also shows improvement on scores based on StereoSet for measuring the demographic bias of a language model. Finally, the paper also presents interesting empirical results comparing to other debiasing methods, showing for example that the number of bias neurons in FairBERTa does not decrease. Instead, the neurons get shifted into earlier layers compared to networks that have not been debiased. Overall, the paper demonstrates the promise of this new technique."

To do so, the authors introduce Integrated Gap Gradients (IG2) as an approach to identify neurons attributable to social bias. Their approach is evaluated on a dataset of around 200000 template-generated samples. The evaluation is carried out by either suppressing or amplifying the detected neurons, and the experimental results demonstrate that doing so indeed reduces or increases the generation of biased outputs. Based on these results, the authors propose a debiasing approach based on the suppression of detected neurons and evaluate it on the StereoSet benchmark. Comparing this approach to a range of baselines, the authors show that the method successfully debiases model predictions while at the same time having little impact on unrelated model predictions (measured via the Language Modeling Score)."

Does the conclusion hold for all models, especially for FairBERTa? \n- It seems most of the time, Union_IG can make the bias score lower. Is it because Union_IG contains more neurons? Does this mean adding more neurons generally helps reduce the bias? How sensitive is the result w.r.t. $\\sigma$?\n- What if you replace Union_IG to Intersection_IG, i.e., the intersection of bias neurons for different attributes?\n- Table 5, it should be \"StereoSet\"."
