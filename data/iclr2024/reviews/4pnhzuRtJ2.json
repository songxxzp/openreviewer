For Figure 3, could you plot privacy-utility tradeoff instead? (i.e., change the x-axis from communication rounds to $\\epsilon$). The same thing also applies to Table 1. For DP experiments, the comparison is only fair when the $\\epsilon$ of different techniques are aligned to be the same. \n\nWhat is the dimension of the gradient? And how is the privacy parameter for releasing a single dimension being composed? For sign-sgd experiment, the total number of composition is gradient dimension x number of rounds, which seems to be very very large and I am not sure what's the final privacy parameter. \n\nAlso, it seems the author assumes each client trains DP models, but for PATE each teacher does not need to be trained differentially private. Therefore, I am not sure whether the comparison in the experiment is fair given that each teacher is already DP but still adds the same noise as what is stated in PATE. Can the author provide a comparison with the original version of PATE for both experiments in Section 6.2 and 6.3?"

                "value": "While the problem studied is interesting, the text is insufficiently rigorous.\n\nThe main idea of the text is mostly clear, but sometimes overloading of notations and other elements lead to confusion.  For example:\n* In Algorithm 1 line 4, $\\gamma$ is a real number\n* In Eq (1), $\\gamma$ is a function $\\gamma:\\mathbb{N}\\to \\{0,1\\}$\n* In Lemma 3.2, $\\gamma$ is a function taking as input $S\\in\\{0,1\\}^K$\n* In Theorem 4.1, $\\gamma$ is a function $\\gamma:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\{0,1\\}$\n* In Eq (3), $\\gamma$ is a tuple of $(K+1)/2$ (not $K$) real numbers (not booleans), i.e., $\\gamma\\in[0,1]^{(K+1)/2}$\n\nWhile the $\\gamma$ confusion is not very harmful, some issues are more problematic, e.g., the formulation of Theorem 4.1:\n* Theorem 4.1 says: \"Consider Problem 1.1 when $p_i = p$, ...\" but Problem 1.1 does not feature a variable $p_i$, $p_i^\\prime$,\n* Theorem 4.1 says: \"Given a privacy budget $m \\in [K]$\", but usually $\\epsilon$ is called a privacy budget and $\\epsilon$ is rarely restricted to be an integer.  Is $m$ really to be interpreted as a privacy budget?  In fact, according to Algorithm 1, $m\\epsilon$ (not just m) is the \"target privacy cost\".\n* Theorem 4.1 says \"Given a privacy budget $m$, if one sets $\\gamma(l) = ...$ when $m\\ge (K+1)/2$\".  The sentence seems ill-structured, I suppose you mean \"if\" rather than \"when\", and it becomes easier to break the sentence down into smaller parts, i.e., \"Let $m\\in[K]$.  If $m\\ge (K+1)/2\" then set $\\gamma(l) = ...$, else ....\".\n* Theorem 4.1 mentions $\\gamma$, which does not occur in Problem 1.1, while Problem 1.1 mentions the majority function g not used in Theorem 4.1.\n\nOther notation and related issues:\n* Lemma 3.1 says $\\gamma_{subsampling}$ depends on $\\mathcal{L}$ and next defines $\\gamma_{subsampling(l)$ rather than $\\gamma_{subsampling}(\\mathcal{L})$.\n* Eq 1 defines both $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma_{subsampling}$.  What is the difference in meaning between the two notations?\n* In Lemma 3.3, what are $\\mathcal{D}$ and $\\mathcal{D}'$ ?  Are these arbitrary datasets, or do you assume they are adjacent datasets?\n* In Lemma 3.3, $\\gamma$ is required to be a \"symmetric function\".  What does this mean exactly?  I guess that the meaning of \"symmetric\" depends on the signature of $\\gamma$, for example, if $\\gamma$ is a function of a single variable, we could call a function for which $\\gamma(l)=\\gamma(K-l)$ symmetric.  If $\\gamma$ is a function of tuples $S$, then we could call $\\gamma$ symmetric if it is invariant under permuting $S$.\n\nThere are a few minor language issues, e.g.,\n* Title of Section 5: \"Optimizing $\\gamma$-function\" -> \"Optimizing the function $\\gamma$\"\n* Section 5: \"On the other hand, one can to optimize for such $\\gamma^*$ but this involves solving \u201cSemi-infinite Programming\u201d, due to the infinitely many privacy constraints.\":  Especially the first part of the sentence doesn't make sense grammatically.  Also, you probably mean 'solving a semi-infinite programming problem' rather than 'solving \"semi-infinite programming\"'.  \n\nSome claims are too optimistic.  For example, Lemma 3.3 says \" ... is $(m\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differentially private if and only if ...\".  There doesn't seem to be a proof (in particular, Appendix B is about preliminaries while appendix C is already about Section 4).  I doubt a proof can exist for this statement, since under the provided conditions DaRRM_\\gamma could be $(m\\epsilon,\\delta$-DP even if Eq (2) is not satisfied, for example if the individual mechanisms $M_i$ are $\\epsilon'$-DP for some $\\epsilon' < \\epsilon$, or if the mechanisms $M_i$ satisfy other favorable conditions.  So while I believe one can prove \"if\", I don't believe one can also prove \"and only if\".\n\nSimilar issues arise in the appendices, which provide a number of proofs but with insufficient rigor to easily determine what is the exact claim nor to easily verify them."
