Under the assumption that the approximate model $\\hat{\\mathcal{P}}$ is given, a corrected model $\\bar{\\mathcal{P}}$ is derived by minimizing the KL divergence $D_{KL} ( \\cdot \\parallel \\hat{\\mathcal{P}})$ with feature matching constraints. The proposed method, MoCoVI and MoCoDyna, employ the corrected dynamics to learn a state value function. Then, the value function trained with the corrected dynamics is used as a new basis function used in the feature matching constraints. MoCoVI and MoCoDyna are compared with OS-VI and OS-Dyna, respectively, on the modified Cliffwalk environment. The experimental results show that the proposed methods converge to the true value function faster than the baselines."

On page 4, the authors mentioned that the number of basis functions, $d$, is usually small, but I am unsure whether it is true in general. I do not know the details of the modified Cliffwalk environment, but I think it is a toy problem. Is $d$ still small if the proposed method is applied to tasks with huge state space?\n\nThe following are minor comments.\n- The end of the second paragraph in Section 2.2: $\\phi(Z)$ should be $\\phi_i(Z)$. \n- The paragraph below equation (3.2): I do not understand the following sentence: $\\bar{\\mathcal{P}}$ is not constructed by the agent.\n- In the first paragraph of Section 3.2, the authors define the function $\\phi: \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$, but $\\phi (x, a)$ is used to compute $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{Model}}(x, a)$.

Both methods iteratively update the basis function, using the value functions derived from MaxEnt MoCo.\nTheoretical analysis suggests that the MoCoVI may converge to the true value function at a faster rate than approximate VI, under specific conditions.

I am not fully convinced by the potential faster convergence of MoCoVI than VI. \n\n    Let\u2019s say that the model is perfect, why should MoCoVI enjoy a faster convergence? Also, in Theorem 2, the comparison between the order of $\\gamma'$  and the order of $\\gamma$ could be oversimplified. For instance, the constant could matter: the big O hides the constant $(3\\sqrt{2})^K$ which could become significant.  Besides that, the $\\gamma'^K$ also hides $(\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma})^K$ but is not addressed in the paper.\n\n    Another concern is regarding the maximum of the ratio over K steps in $\\gamma'$. Can the authors comment on the implications of it on the robustness of the algorithm?\n\n2. The gap between theory and experiments: the theoretical analysis suggests applicability to both finite and continuous MDPs, yet experimental validation is confined to a small-scale tabular MDP. Broadening the experimental scope to include continuous MDPs would substantiate the theoretical findings more comprehensively.\n\n3. The requirement in MaxEnt MoCo to sample the dynamics `d` times for each state-action visited, seems to restrict its practical applicability.\n\n4. The paper could be improved with additional clarifications in certain sections. I would ask the authors to help address the following:\n\n    a. Is there any assumption on the action space? It does not appear to have been stated in the paper, except for MoCoDyna where Algorithms 1 assumes a finite MDP. It appears that there's an implicit assumption that MaxEnt MoCo and MoCoVI are applicable to both finite and infinite action spaces. However, the approximate VI method that MoCoVI is compared with, traditionally assumes a finite action space [Munos 2007]. Could the authors clarify why the finite action space assumption is not necessary for MoCoVI?\n\n    b. The introduction claims that the theoretical analysis is applicable to \u201cboth finite and continuous MDPs\u201d. Does this applicability refer to both the exact and approximate versions of the proposed methods? Considering the complexity often associated with analyzing continuous spaces in RL, a further explanation on how the proposed analysis overcomes these challenges would be beneficial.\n\n    c. The algorithm for MoCoDyna, as presented in Section 5, is specific to finite MDPs, yet prior analysis encompasses both finite and continuous MDPs. The paper suggests the possibility of extending MoCoDyna to incorporate function approximation without elaborating on the approach. Could the authors clarify if the focus on finite MDPs is solely for the sake of a simpler presentation, or are there inherent difficulties when adapting the algorithm to function approximations?\n\n    d. The significance of the additional `c` features in the `d+c` features in MoCoDyna is not clear. Could the authors provide clarifications, and guidance on how to select `c`?\n\n    e. The paper assumes that we can make exact queries to P in MoCoVI. Yet, the algorithm description only has approximation $\\psi$ and lacks details on how $\\psi$ is updated.\n\nMinor:\n\nIt would be beneficial if the algorithmic procedures for MaxEnt MoCo and MoCoVI were presented (perhaps in the appendix) in a structured algorithm format, similar to MoCoDyna. \n\nTypos:\n\n1. Is the $|| V^{\\pi_{PE}} ||_\\infty$ before Sec. 3.2 missing anything?\n\n2. Sec. 3.2: domain of $\\phi$ should be $\\mathcal{X}$ $\\times \\mathcal{A}$ instead of $\\mathcal{X}$.\n\n3. Sec. 3.1: in the equation at the end of paragraph 1, the expectation should be w.r.t. $\\bar{P}$."
