                "value": "Dataset Construction:\u20281. The example provided in the Appendix from the task \"Prompt Prioritization\" appears to be an unsuitable choice for evaluating GV-consistency. This task specifically requests the model to enumerate the \"benefits\" of the 2nd amendment, which inherently biases the output towards positive aspects. Consequently, when the Validator is tasked with judging bias from the generated text, it is more likely to yield a biased (\"B\") outcome.\n2. An evident drawback in the methodology is the absence of human evaluation for assessing the quality of data generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).\n3. The current format for the \"Close-book QA\" task seems to introduce unnecessary complexity. Instead of maintaining a straightforward approach, such as simply judging whether the provided answer is correct or not, the task involves considering misleading answers. This inclusion of potentially misleading responses adds layers of uncertainty and can compromise the clarity of the evaluation process.\u2028\u2028Evaluation Framework:\n1. The results presented in Table 5 are perplexing, particularly regarding how the validator is evaluated for tasks like \"PriorityP\" and other LLM-generated tasks. The source of the \"answer\" used to judge the validator's performance is unclear, leading to confusion in interpreting the results.\u2028\n2. The current framework predominantly focuses on consistency, with limited attention to accuracy, highlighted mainly in Table 5. It would be more beneficial to integrate factual correctness into the assessment, alongside consistency. Developing a leaderboard that encapsulates both these aspects would provide a more comprehensive and meaningful evaluation.\u2028\u2028\n\nWriting issue:\u20281. Under Figure1 there are too much space which disrupts the flow of the text.\u20282. The improvement for the performance of validator is \u201c6.3&\u201d in abstract, but \u201c6.5%\u201d in section 6.3"

After fine-tuning LLMs with GV-consistency filtered data, the GV-consistency improves for the original ALPACA-30B model across 6 tasks and also outperforms baseline SELFTRAIN.

The paper hypothesizes that this could be due to the relatively low performance of initial generator/validator. However,  with the reported generator/validator performance of the initial model, it is not clear how \u201clow\u201d the initial generator/validator performance could impact the effectiveness of this approach. It would be useful to investigate on LLMs of other different model sizes and initial generator/validator performances on various tasks, to gain more insights on the effectiveness of the approach on different initial generator/validator performances, which could also correspond to different categories of tasks.\n\nb.\t Section 7.2 is quite superficially analyzed. CC-FT could be considered as providing both consistent and inconsistent data for the model to fine-tune, whereas the consistency fine-tuning only uses consistent data to fine-tune.
