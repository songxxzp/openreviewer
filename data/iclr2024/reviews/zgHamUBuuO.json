                "value": "The paper looks into the problem of learning sparse intermediate activations that preserve spatial information, which can help interpret the intermediate outcomes better and be useful for certain tasks. The paper argues that existing methods based on regularization, such as L1 norm on activations, have drawbacks of either low sparsity rate or low accuracy. To overcome this, the paper introduces optimizations such as an extra spatial sparsity layer normalization layer before the activation and iteratively induces a higher sparsity rate during training. The paper evaluates the proposed method on three tasks DIGITCIRCLE, LATEX-OCR, AUDIOMNISTSEQUENCE and shows that it can achieve higher sparsity and higher accuracy than several baselines."

While the interpretability of deep neural networks is crucial, the paper looks into the problem from the angle of changing the model architecture and training method to obtain more interpretable representations. As such, it is less clear how the proposed method can impact state-of-the-art deep neural networks that have been used in practice. It would be more helpful if the authors could add some real applications where sparse activations are useful. \n\n2. Related to the motivation issue, the datasets the paper uses for evaluation seem to be a bit artificial and at a tiny scale. It would be helpful if the authors could elaborate a bit more on how the tasks/domains can interact with real-world applications. Also, given the small scale of the datasets, it raises questions on how well the proposed methods can generalize to larger and more complex data.\n\n3. The paper introduces many additional hyperparameters, such as M, d_T, /delta_update. However, the paper does not explain how these hyperparameters are selected, such as the search space and the sensitivity of each hyperparameter.\n\n4. The paper claims that the adaptive sparsity training technique is novel, but it seems to be similar to the iterative pruning method proposed in the lottery ticket hypothesis paper, except that the paper applies it to the activation and via the parameter in the spacial sparsify layer. The paper should better clarify the differences."

Not having any guarantees on the identifiability of the latent variables jeopardizes the proposed method, which seeks to find meaningful/interpretable latent variables without any explicit supervision. When is a given amount of data enough to guarantee that the proposed method can recover all the latent factors? And, are there any other specific requirements needed to have disentangled factor of variations as discussed in [2]?\n    - Since no theoretical guarantee is provided, it would be good to contextualize more the empirical claim on the motif identifiability which in turn, will justify the use of the proposed method.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] M.
