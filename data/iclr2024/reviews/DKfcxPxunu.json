Quite a number of subsequent works surpass it, such as Efficient Active Search and 'Simulation-guided Beam Search for Neural Combinatorial Optimization'. In this sense, the comparison is not that convincing. \n3. Although the authors reviewed and criticized 'Efficient Training of Multi-task Combinarotial Neural Solver with Multi-armed Bandits', it is the most relevant baseline to this paper. It is good to compare with it in some adapted or tailored experimental settings.\n4. In table 2, where the proposed method is inferior to other neural baselines should be analyzed and explained.\n5. In table 3, the generic traditional methods like LKH-3 and OR-tools should be included.\nOverall, the methodological novelty and the experimental results are not significant."

As illustrated, different VRPs need to use different masking mechanisms to handle constraints. If a VRP variant is very complex, would it be hard to design a masking mechanism? Or even would there be some complex constraints that cannot be handled directly by masking?\n3.
