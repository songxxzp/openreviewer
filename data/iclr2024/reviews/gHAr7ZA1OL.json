The authors seem list them as different. But as I see, they are the same problem.\n-The forward and reverse process are not clear due to the poor writting.\n-Fig.1 and Fig.2 are redundant which evens show similar objective about the proposed MPD. Also, the designed method seems complex and not easy to follow.\n-I also concern about the claim \"lacking unknown data\".

Following the previous method VOS that alleviates the OOD-OD problem by adaptively synthesizing virtual outliers, MPD also attempts to synthesize suitable virtual OOD features as well as generate augmented features for supervised training. Different from VOS that assumes a class-conditional multivariate Gaussian distribution of the feature space, MPD in this paper tries to add noise to the phase domain in the diffusion way. Moreover, the authors find that the Gaussian Average for processing each step is better than directly adding noise. Many experiments and ablation studies have verified that MPD is superior than previous methods for dealing with OOD-OD."

Introducing diffusion to generate different features is a new attempt in OOD. After discovering that simply and directly adding noise according to the original method was problematic, the authors proposed their own effective improvement strategies.\n\n3. Quantitative experimental results prove the advancement of MPD in many OOD-OD benchmarks."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Similarly, we summarize the weaknesses of this paper as follows:\n\n1. Actually, studying the processing of features from a phase perspective is not the first of its kind in this paper. In other words, the method [1] has proven that phase-related features are content-oriented in the DG field, which is very similar to OOD. This paper directly uses such a conclusion of DG in OOD and cannot be regarded as a complete innovation.\n\n2. Generally speaking, there are quite a few steps in the continuous transformation of the Diffusion model, such as dozens or even hundreds of steps. The method in this paper seems to only use up to 4 interations (T=4 in Table 5). Why not try more steps? Is it because more parameters are introduced (such as the U-Net model for predicting feature maps, and two branches for generating new features in OOD) that it is inconvenient to increase T to a too large number? If so, the authors need to explain clearly how the new method MPD increases the number of parameters compared to the original basic detector, such as the used Faster R-CNN.\n\n3. As we all know, Faster R-CNN is a classic but outdated detector. It gives a weak baseline of detection comparing to recent new ones. The actual value of OOD-OD is to achieve robust and generalizable object detection in real applications. Thus, using advanced basic detectors such as YOLOv5 [2], YOLOv8 [3], TOOD [4] and DETRs is more meaningful. And it will be important to see if the proposed MPD works or not on these superior detectors. It may not be practical to do more experiments. The authors could give similar explanations and discussions. For example, is MPD universal to these superior detectors?\n\n[1] Decompose, Adjust, Compose: Effective Normalization by Playing With Frequency for Domain Generalization, CVPR 2023\n\n[2] https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5, YOLOv5 2020\n\n[3] https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics, YOLOv8 2023\n\n[4] TOOD: Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection, ICCV 2021"
