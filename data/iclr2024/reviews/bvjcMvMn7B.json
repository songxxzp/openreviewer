                "value": "The study focuses on enhancing the performance of GNNs for semi-supervised node classification, even when high-quality labeled samples are scarce. Traditional active learning methods may not work optimally in graph data, given their unique structures and the bias introduced by the positioning of labeled nodes. To address this, the researchers introduce a unified optimization framework called SCARCE, which can be combined with node features. Their experiments confirm that this method not only enhances GNN performance but also helps mitigate structural bias and improve fairness in the results."

Otherwise, it is very hard to estimate the significance of this work. \n\n2. My major concern is that the fairness definition in this paper is not very clear. We usually use demographic party (DP) or equal odds (EO) to measure fairness. However, this paper only uses the Standard Deviation (SD) and the Coefficient of Variation. Why do the authors consider them instead of DP and EO?\n\n3. Figure 6 and Figure 7 are also not very clear to me. The authors discussed that 'SCARCE, which combines both SIS and LPS variance, SCARCE can not only elevate overall performance but also attain commendable fairness'. However, it is very hard to get this result from these two figures. I suggest the authors provide more details for examination.\n\n4. This paper should focus on fairness instead of classification accuracy. However, Tables 1 and 2 provide more details about the classification accuracy. There should be a trade-off between accuracy and fairness. Only showing accuracy does not make any sense. In addition, how to balance the trade-off between accuracy and fairness in this paper. I do not find any implementation details related to this."

The goal of active learning is different from mitigating the bias in graphs and the ultimate goal of AL is to use as few as labeled nodes to achieve the best prediction performance. Therefore, the motivation of this work is totally unclear. \n\n3. The paper does not provide any theoretical proof to support the findings or the motivations.
