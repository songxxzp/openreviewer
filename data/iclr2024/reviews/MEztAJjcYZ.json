However, it is well known that these scores do not often correlate with human ratings. As such, it is vital for this kind of study to have human evaluations on the quality of the generated summaries, perhaps among different aspects.\n2. **Marginal improvement but significantly more cost.** From Tables 2 and 3, it seems that the proposed method only marginally outperforms the previous SOTA, especially on the English dataset (48.82 v.s. 48.24 by GPT-4 + ICL). However, the proposed method obviously uses much more computation. I would like to see more analyses on comparing the latency or computing cost by different methods.\n3. Overall this is an over-optimized method for a specialized task (generating doctor-patient conversation summaries), so it might not appeal to most of the audience in this venue."

Different from existing approaches that involve self-evaluation where LLM is used to critique and improve its own generation results, a separate small-scale fine-tuned scoring model and a separate refinement LLM are employed to iteratively score and refine a clinical summary initially generated by LLM with in-context learning. The framework applied to initial summaries generated by GPT4 + ICL shows solid improvement over several competitive fine-tuned and zero-shot ICL baselines. And the ablation studies conducted by the authors showed the necessity of both added models and several other key designs in the proposed framework. This paper overall presents an easy-to-follow yet effective refinement approach to improve upon existing LLM models in the domain of medical summarization."

A few minor clarifications may be needed (addressed in weaknesses and questions sections).\n\nSignificance:\nThe paper is definitely of great interest for practical research in the domain of medical NLP, specifically on the topic of medical dialogue summarization, which has already seen a slew of applications in commercial use (e.g., AWS Healthscribe, Microsoft/Nuance DAX); but the general framework of iteratively improving upon LLM capabilities for summarization could be generalizable to text summarization in other domains as well, especially when there are specific rules for target text."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The major weakness is the lack of human evaluation, or more thorough selection of automatic evaluation metrics that correlate well directly with the quality dimensions proposed by the authors: the authors preamble the motivation for the research as LLM fails to follow explicit and implicit guidelines specific to the problem of clinical note generation, with which the reviewer agrees, but unfortunately the final improvement was reported only in a limited selection of evaluation metrics, most of which are based on lexical similarity (with the exception of Bertscore). It is therefore hard to draw the conclusion whether an improvement in Rouge or Meteor score is indeed an improvement in the generated summaries better meeting the said guidelines.\n\nAnother obvious weakness is the inclusion of all sections in final evaluation while applying the proposed framework only to a subset of sections (e.g., on ACI-Bench, evaluation is done for all sections but REFLEXSE is applied only to HPI and A/P). Although ablation study presented in the paper hints at the effectiveness of the framework even if only affected sections were evaluated, it would still be more robust to separate the sections not involved in the framework in the evaluation."

            "questions": {
                "value": "A couple of suggestions:\n1. Section 4.2, *...large datasets are good at capturing this conciseness, thereby benefiting the computation of the Rouge-L metric...* may be an unsubstantiated statement, the different between the leading Rouge-L score and the model's score is barely larger than one s.d., the difference may just be statistically insignificant.\n2. Section 4.2, *...The former facilitates the calculation of Rouge-1/2 metrics, primarily centered around precision, while the latter is conducive to Meteor metric calculations, primarily emphasizing recall...*. Can't say I agree with the statement here: what type of Rouge scores did you report in the results? Rouge P/R/F1? Unless it is Rouge precision, rouge is generally a recall-based metrics. Meteor in its default setting is biasing towards recall, but a low meteor score could be caused by either low recall of unigram or larger penalty of chunk continuity (e.g., addition of unmatched words or wrong word order). Are any of these factors more prominent in the generated summaries than precision/recall based analysis?\n   1. it may be instructive to report the typical length (word count) of the generated summary, or an average ratio in word count between generated and reference summaries. Rouge is well-known to exhibit a length bias, so the different improvement across different metrics may simply be due to length.\n3. Section 4.3, **Accuracy of the small model**, since you also mentioned some initial generation may be correct and removed from fine-tuning the small scorer model, using a score comparison to define accuracy is a bit contradictory. One interesting quantity to analyze may be $Corr(X, Y)$, where X is the difference in the scores between reference summary and a generated summary (not necessarily the initial generation), and Y is some metrics of the generated summary evaluated against reference. If you observe a strong negative correlation, then it means the scoring model $r()$ correlates well with the target metrics, therefore making it appropriate as a \"judge\" for iterative scheduler that aims to improve the target metrics.\n4. Figure 2, it is better to use separate legends for the two bars for the ACI-Bench dataset, since the section names are different across these two datasets.\n\nA few clarifying questions:\n1. How are the examples in Error2Correct module selected? Randomly chosen or is some similarity-based selection involved? How are they created? Are they available in the datasets (probably not in ACI-Bench) or annotated through separate effort?\n2. How does the Rule prompt embed the guidelines for clinical notes? Take SOAP note for example, specific institutions may provide very specific guidelines such as \"always use pronouns\", \"always state date in MM/DD/YYYY format\", etc. Did you use any instructions like these, or a more generic collection of guidelines. Can you provide a table of rule prompts used in the experiments?\n3. Table 3, variants 1-3 very clearly show the importance of the small-model, but variant 1 is one iteration of refinement through error correction and it's already showing large improvement over GPT+ICL baseline, this makes me wonder if you could provide a plot of model performance as a function of inference time or number of iterations to show if the framework already displays diminishing return behavior. In other words, how much extra time would one pay to get improvement from (Rouge1 52.13 -> 57.49 to Rouge1 52.13 -> 58.42)?\n\nLastly, a very minor suggestion is that since clinical data is involved, it's best to include an \"Ethical Consideration\" section to state clearly the nature of the data and no PHI was involved."
