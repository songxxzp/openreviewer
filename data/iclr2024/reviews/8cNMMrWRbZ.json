For example, the authors can analyze which capability in Section 4.1 is easier or less likely to be improved. Also, the authors can consider how to disentangle the evaluation of capabilities in each task.\n* Generated examples by the trained agents can be added. Although the authors have put emphasis on \u201cour goal is not to utilize this approach to benchmark whether LLMs are good at talking to humans, but rather as a way to test RL algorithms with datasets that are sufficiently difficult and complex so as to gauge how effective they might be if they were then trained on data from real humans.\u201c in Introduction, it is good to see how relevant the obtained rewards and the conversation's naturalness are.\n* While the paper claims to focus on LLM, the experiments are conducted on GPT2-small and medium (according to Table3), which may be controversial. I\u2019m also confused by the contradiction in Section 7 and Table3. In Section 7, the authors say they \u201cprimarily trained and evaluated models with a maximum 1.5B parameters\u201d, but Table3 shows the experiments are conducted on less than 355M parameters. Therefore, I\u2019m wondering how large is the trained agent in Table2 actually?\n* The writing of section 4.1 can be further improved.

For example, the desired capability for every task. For now some are left in the appendix.\n* Typos:\n  * Is the Twenty Questions task example in Figure 2 needed to exchange the labels of environment and agent? I guess it should be the environment to say yes or no, but not the agent.\n  * There is no reference to table in Appendix C (which is mentioned in section 5.1). I guess Appendix C should mention Table 3 in it.\n  * Do the authors actually mean \u201cdo NOT consider\u201d in Section 2 - 2nd paragraph?
