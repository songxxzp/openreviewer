I read section 4 for multiple times and tried to figure out the implementation details of Standardized Embedder, but I still have some questions. \n  - I don't understand \"any subset of the baseline feature set B can be directly associated with a binary vector $\\{0,1\\}^N$\". Definition 2 is thereby unclear to me.\n  - I think there may be a typo related to $\\delta$-equivalence. In **Definition 1**, $\\delta$-equivalence means the expected similarity between transformed features is larger than $1-\\delta$, therefore if the $\\delta$ is small, then the similarity is high (near to one). However, in the last line in page 6, \"the optimization wants to find a subset of the baseline features that is $\\delta$-equivalent to $F$ for larger $\\delta$\". I think the \"larger $\\delta$\" should be corrected as smaller $\\delta$. \n  - Although I understand the idea of standardization (using baseline features to derive the features of models and tasks), there are still other details of this method, and why are them designed in this way? For example, \n    - Why is $v$ constrained in $[0,1]^n$?\n    - Why is the equivalence defined using affine transformations? For example, why don't we use $w^TF(x)$ only?\n- The design of Standardized Embedder lacks enough justification. For example,\n  - Are there any theoretical justification for the standardization? Although it's intuitive, the theoretical analysis is necessary to explain the effectiveness.\n  - The comparison between Standardized Embedder and other existing model selection methods are missing. \n  - The study on task distribution generalization is missing. It's unclear if the selection works for task distributional shifts in downstream tasks. For example, as the current datasets are all about classification - what about the selection performance on other tasks like segmentation or object detection?\n- There are some weaknesses about the experimental settings.\n  - The \"underlying distribution D\" is approximated using ImageNet, which has class overlap with CIFAR (downstream task dataset).\n  - The models are trained with a linear classifier and fixed feature. This is usually different with downstream fine-tuning. The results may thereby not be applicable to real applications as full model fine-tuning usually results in better results."

However, the scalability of existing solutions is limited with the increasing amounts of candidates. This work presents a new paradigm for model selection, namely independently-prepared query-efficient model selection. The advantage of their paradigm is twofold: first, it is query-efficient, meaning that it requires only a constant amount of model operations every time it selects models for a new task; second, it is independently-prepared, meaning that any information about a candidate model that is necessary for the selection can be prepared independently requiring no interaction with others. Consequently, the new paradigm offers many desirable properties for applications: updatability, decentralizability, flexibility, and certain preservation of both candidate privacy and query privacy. With the benefits uncovered, they present Standardized Embedder as a proof-of-concept solution to support the practicality of the proposed paradigm. Empirical results across different model architectures and various training recipes highlight the potential of the proposed paradigm."

The theoretical proof is not sufficient to strongly support the author's point of view, while for the author's so-called new paradigm I suggest to describe it in relation to a specific application scenario.\n3. The author's experiments I think are scanty and should be supplemented. Since it is a new paradigm, it should be suitable for all types of tasks and not just limited to deep models for object classification, or it should not be limited to the CV domain, but cover other such as NLP text classification, tabular classification, time-series classification and so on.\n4. With the authors' experimental setup, I see that the claimed 100 pre-trained models are different hyper-parameter settings for several commonly used models, such as the number of network layers and so on. This is a different selection of models than what I understand, and I think the authors' experiments are more appropriately classified as either neural architecture search or hyperparameter optimization. Simply by modifying the hyperparameters should not be referred to as a different model."
