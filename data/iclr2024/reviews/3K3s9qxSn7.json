The authors introduce a special class of majority MDPs and theoretically demonstrate that while the transition and reward functions of these MDPs have low representation complexity, the optimal Q-function exhibits exponential representation complexity. The paper then extends these findings empirically by examining MuJoCo Gym environments and measuring the relative approximation errors of neural networks in fitting these functions. The results demonstrate that the optimal Q-functions are significantly harder to approximate than the transition and reward functions which supports their theoretical findings."

And the authors provides unique insights into why model-based algorithms usually enjoy better sample complexity than model-free algorithms from a novel representation complexity perspective.\n- The theoretical results are supported by empirical demonstrations."

This work introduces the definitions of Parity MDP and Majority MDP and proves that the reward function and the transition function have lower circuit complexity than value functions. Experiments are conducted in MuJoCo continuous control tasks with SAC algorithm, quantitively corroborating the theoretical results."

Some important details are missing, e.g., the exact computation of the approximation error of the optimal Q-function.
