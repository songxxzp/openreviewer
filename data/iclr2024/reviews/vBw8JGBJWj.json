Additionally, a clustering method has been introduced as a replacement for Kmeans, leveraging the learned representations to address the issue of imbalanced bin size.\n* UnitigBin has been evaluated on 12 datasets against baseline methods. The binning results have been assessed by evaluating both the completeness and contamination of the bins using checkM and by evaluating the accuracy of clustering via Precision, Recall, F1, and ARF scores."

The results from datasets with assembly graphs generated by two different assemblers demonstrate that UNITIGBIN outperforms the compared methods in overall."

Additionally, the binning steps appear to be a combination of Metacoag (binning initialization) and RepBin (propagating and refining) with limited improments. The authors should provide a more detailed and distinct description of the similarities and differences.\n\nThe experiments are inadequate in terms of comparing the results obtained from unitig-level assembly graphs with those from contig-level assembly graphs. These experiments are significant for demonstrating the transition from unitig-level assembly graphs to contig-level assembly graphs.\n\nThe experiments are insufficient. Most of the datasets are small-scale single-sample datasets. For a more robust comparison of binning performance, it is recommended to utilize the CAMI I and CAMI II benchmark datasets.  In addition, the recently introduced Metadecoder has shown its effectiveness as a method. SemiBin2, an improvement over Semibin1, presents a novel approach specifically designed for long read data. It is highly recommended that the authors include these methods in the benchmark analysis.\n\nWe recommend that the authors employ Checkm2 to assess MAG quality, as it outperforms the original version of CheckM in predicting MAG quality, even for those with sparse genomic representation or reduced genome size.\n\nThis method is tailored to address a particular problem and may pose challenges when attempting to adapt it for use in different domains."
