In particular, it proposes an enlarged optimizer search space constructed using tree-based grammar using building blocks of both update equations as well as decay functions (functions of the optimization step number). To search over this space, the authors employ a mutation-only genetic algorithm that evolves optimizers by mutating and selecting the best optimizer according to its generalization performance on the Cifar-10 dataset. The authors also propose a sanity check to eliminate degenerate optimizers by first checking its performance when training on a quadratic task to save compute. The discovered optimizers are shown to outperform or match existing hand-designed optimizers on training/fine-tuning EffNetV2Small on multiple vision datasets."

                "value": "1. __Significance in the Contribution__. To my understanding, the two types of contributions the authors can make in this paper are: __1)__ proposing a new set of algorithm procedures (including new search space, search algorithm, integrity check) to find better optimizers; __2)__ the actual optimizers found and any insights obtained from analyzing them.\n    \n    In terms of __1)__, despite the authors doing a generally good job of documenting their procedures for reproducibility, the actual procedures are very specialized to the ConvNet model architecture (with multiple rounds of different types of heuristics to filter the search candidates) and might still be difficult to replicate and also generalize to a new task, architecture combination. \n    \n    In terms of __2)__, it\u2019s not clear to me how much better the discovered optimizers are compared to existing hand-designed optimizers like Adam. All of the results in Table 6 are evaluated using a single model architecture EffNetV2Small after performing some final optimizer candidate selection directly over this model architecture. Therefore, it\u2019s unclear to what degree these optimizers can general to other models. Besides, focusing on EffNetV2Small, over the non-cifar tasks (tasks not used in the optimizer selection), there always exist hand-designed optimizers that are close if not better than the discovered ones. Finally, in terms of interpreting the analytical form of the discovered optimizers, the paragraph at the end of page 8 and beginning of page 9 are more of surface-level descriptions of the experimental results rather than a distilled summary and insights, making it difficult to parse the key message the authors wish to convey.\n    \n2. **Evaluating the importance of enlarging the search space**. As one of the claimed contributions of the paper is an enlarged optimizer search with more operands, operators, and decay functions, it is expected that the authors should perform an ablation study to understand the benefit of the introduced enlarged search space. The bare-minimum ablation baseline is to train on the datasets in Table 6 using several of the optimizers discovered by Bello et al (2017) and compare whether the performances of the optimizers discovered in this paper are better than those discovered in a smaller search space.\n\n3. **Incomplete results**. Part of the results in Table 6 are unfinished as the authors claim to finish before the rebuttal period."

                "value": "- In Bello et al (2017), in addition to tables comparing optimizers\u2019 performance, learning curves of optimizers\u2019 generalization performance progression are also shown. For some of the cases, it helps reader to see that Bello et al's discovered optimizers can converge faster than hand-designed methods for cases where the final performances might be similar. I suggest the authors also consider showing such graphs to provide additional information of the discovered optimizers.\n- The authors should formally define what a decay function is. I personally found it hard to understand the terminology until I read its definition in Bello et al (2017).\n- The authors mention that the mutation operator in the paper selects the best mutated child as the next position for the particle. It\u2019s not clear to me whether this best child is compared against its parent. Can the authors clarify if this is done? (If so, then the selection should guarantee monotonic performance improvement.)\n- On page 4, the authors use the term \u201cnon-distributive function\u201d. However, I wonder if the authors mean to say non-homogeneous function."

To achieve the goal claimed in this paper, the authors prepare a lot of different components for the project's implementation.\n\nThe convenient way to verify if the proposed method works for the current fact is to search an optimizer on some SOTA neural networks, and then to check if the performance of the compared SOTA can be improved.\n\nThe format of references should be updated, the current form of submission is hard to read."

I do like the transferability experiments, where the algorithms are tested across various image classification tasks.
