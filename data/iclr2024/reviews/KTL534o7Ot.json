            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* The support for fairness seems limited. There are many fairness definitions in the literature beyond demographic parity including equalized odds, equal opportunity, predictive parity, equal error rates, individual fairness, and causal fairness, which seem to be ignored here. The proposed work would be much more interesting if it could also be configured for the other fairness measures as well. Supporting demographic parity only gives the impression that only the easiest fairness measure is supported, and there is no discussion on how to possibly extend the framework to other measures either.\n\n* Emphasizing the programmability of ProgSyn sounds a bit exaggerated. For example, Figure 3 looks like a conventional config file instead of say a Python program. When using DP, a user always specify epsilon and delta, but this is not called programming.\n\n* It is not clear why DP should be optimized together with fairness holistically. Why not generate a fair dataset using an existing technique or a fairness-only version of ProgSyn and then add random noise to satisfy DP? This two-step approach should be a baseline and compared with ProgSyn empirically.\n\n* It would be more interesting to see the limitations of this method where the accuracy actually has to drop in order to satisfy various constraints. The current experiments only show success cases, but fairness and privacy are not necessary aligning, so there has to be a point where the accuracy cannot be maintained. In Table 3, there is almost no reduction of accuracy after applying DP, which suggests that the proposed method may have not been stressed tested enough. Hence, there should be more extensive experiments showing what happens in truly challenging scenarios."

The overall architecture of this framework is based on a two-stage process, starting with pre-training of the generated model using sampling and decoder structures, and then fine-tuning specific downstream tasks and adapting to their requirements.  At the same time, in the process of concrete implementation, ProgSyn uses the relaxed version of differential privacy, descriptive requirements and specification to achieve the programmability of the whole process.  The structure of this paper is reasonable and the content is clear, which provides a good model for the research of controlled table data generation.  In subsequent experiments and appendices, the authors also intelligently present their contributions and ideas by using selected datasets."

The proposed ProgSyn framework, utilizing a pretraining and fine-tuning architecture, effectively caters to the requirements of downstream tasks in practical scenarios.\n2.\tIn terms of methodology, the authors employ three approaches: differential privacy constraints, logical constraints, and statistical formulations. These strategies support the programmable nature of ProgSyn and demonstrate careful consideration for its differentiability, thereby enhancing its practical implement ability.\n3.\tWithin this paper, the proposed differential computation for binary masks addresses the challenge of non-differentiable hard logical constraints and counts. This method provides an effective means for controlling the content generated by the model during the generation process.\n4.\tThe supporting materials provided in this paper exhibit well code writing standardization and good applicability. The code content aligns well with the paper's core ideas, making it an excellent resource for readers seeking a deeper understanding of the author's concepts."

                "value": "1.\tTheoretical Framework: Although the research area explored in this paper holds promise for further investigation, the technical aspects in the paper appear somewhat dated, primarily covering foundational theories and methods. Considering the goal of ProgSyn is to generate sufficiently realistic simulated data with privacy protection properties, the authenticity aspect is addressed mainly in terms of experimental accuracy (given that XGBoost is a robust classifier), without validating its reliability from a statistical hypothesis testing perspective. This arrangement may lead to a somewhat one-sided argument in the paper.\n2.\tWriting Clarity: The content in the paper's introduction appears somewhat disorganized, as it combines background introduction with an overview of the framework's methodology. It is recommended to organize the sections logically as \"introduction,\" \"related work,\" and \"formulation\" to help readers better understand the core content of the paper. Additionally, there are instances of non-standard writing in the paper, such as lengthy formulas (page 6), pseudocode (page 5), page breaks (page 15, 20, 25), and inconsistencies in paper formatting (page 10-12). Also, it's important to address the improper use of color in tables.\n3.\tCode: To facilitate the research framework's wider adoption, it's advisable to update the code version requirements. Personally, I encountered issues with running the code on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 with CUDA capability sm_89, and it would be beneficial to address compatibility concerns to ensure broader accessibility and usability."

                "value": "Regarding this study's research, I have the following queries:\n1.\tTypically, table data is more widespread and common than image data. Does the controllable generation method proposed in this paper aim to fill the missing distributions in real data, as opposed to directly applying conditional filtering within the table? Because it is cheaper to filter tabular data through simple rules than to generate data compared to other data structures.\n2.\tIn the field of image generation, we can rely on our own visual judgment or specific discriminators or metrics, such as FID, for authenticity assessment. Apart from the loss function control methods mentioned in this paper, are there more reliable approaches for verifying the authenticity of the generated data?\n3.\tIn practical scenarios involving table data, recommendation systems present a more realistic application. Since relying solely on a highly generalizable model like XGBoost might not provide strong model performance validation, can ProgSyn consider further methodological validation (e.g., using models from other domains like ONN, xDeepFM, or more general models like SVM, GBDT)?\n4.\tIn the main text, I didn't come across rigorous proofs related to statistical control of table data generation. Could you provide some information on the formulation process for statistical control? This would greatly assist readers in understanding controllable generation."
