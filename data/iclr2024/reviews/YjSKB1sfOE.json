Experiments show an image with a specific patch (eg, a deer image with a specific patch) can be generated, but the backdoored model also generates a truck image with the patch. This paper also tries to study the relationship between backdoor defense and attacks, as well as the effect of data replication."

                "value": "1. I don't quite understand the logic of this paper. It proposes a new but weak attack method and then shows it's easier to detect this attack because of the weakness of the proposed attack. A bad backdoor attack is expected to be easily detected. It seems that all the insights in this paper are based on this new attack and thus not valid. And in fact, it's questionable if this is a backdoor attack.\n\n2. This attack is not well-defined, precise, or stealthy. This paper's attack goal is to generate a deer's image with a specific patch when the input condition is \"a truck\". This is not a backdoor. Existing literature defines the goal as generating specific images (e.g., one specific image or images with a specific patch, etc, ) whenever the input condition contains trigger words such as \"[T]\". The backdoor shouldn't be triggered if the input condition doesn't contain \"[T]\". This paper's method is not a backdoor attack. When the input condition is \"a truck\", it will generate a deer with the patch, a truck with the patch, or a clean truck. It's more like training a bad classifier with mislabeled data and the classifier will randomly predict a label for a truck. There's no way to consistently or precisely trigger the backdoor effects. This is probably why authors have A(2) and other observations related to the \"amplification\".\n\n3. The proposed method can only attack conditional diffusion models, while VillanDiff can attack both conditional and unconditional diffusion models.\n\n4. This paper claims Baddiff and VillanDiff change the sampling process. However, it's not the case according to my understanding. They change the input distribution but not the sampling process. Changing the input distribution is reasonable, as backdoor-attacking image classifiers also adds triggers to the input image and thus changes the input distribution.\n\n5. Experimental details are missing. What are the training details such as learning rate, and epochs? Which part of the stable diffusion models is trained? What's the accuracy of the ResNet-50 used to measure the misalignment? How are the images in G1-G4 generated (only using the target class)? How are existing backdoor detection methods such as STRIP applied to the diffusion models because they are designed for classifiers?\n\n6. The Y-axis of Figure 7 means the similarity between the training image B and its replicated counterpart C. Why are there a lot of points at the left bottom corner? Does it mean B is very different from its replicated image? But I think they should be very similar. If so, does it mean the similarity metric is problematic?"

Based on the second observation, the paper proposes a novel backdoor defense via training DM models on the suspicious dataset. Datasets with high poisoning rates will produce DMs with amplified trigger appearance, thus allowing more accurate backdoor detection. Datasets with low poisoning rates, instead, have the DMs transform malicious data into benign and be safe to be used for retraining. Backdoored DMs can also be used as image classifiers with improved robustness. Finally, the paper shows that poisoning the replicated training data leads to increased data replication."

It is recommended to examine if the bilateral effects still appear with more sophisticated dirty-label (e.g., WaNet, LIRA) and clean-label attacks (e.g., LabelConsistent, SIG) and whether the proposed backdoor defense is helpful in those cases.\n- The authors should provide more details on the Caltech-15 dataset, including the selected classes, the statistics on data size, and the absolute ratios of poisoned and clean images of the target class.\n- In Table 3, the proposed approach only helps to improve backdoor detection accuracy on the generated images; it cannot be used to filter backdoor examples in the original training data. Hence, it does not help to mitigate datasets with moderate-to-high poisoning rates, unlike many other backdoor defense approaches. \n- In Table 4, the classifiers trained on generated data, while being more robust, have significant accuracy drops (sometimes more than 10%).
