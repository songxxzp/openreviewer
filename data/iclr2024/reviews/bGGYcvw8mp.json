The longer the repeated part, the stronger the reinforcement effect (Figure 3).\nIt then shows that even discontinuous repeated subsequences give rise to the reinforcement effect.\nSection 4 studies the effect of the reinforcement effect on ICL. The effect can help constrain the output space and the desired pattern, but it can also lead to incorrect results."

Do the authors argue that co-occurrence reinforcement is implicated in LMs' ability to pick up input-label mappings? And what \"inner workings\" are responsible for the co-occurrence effect? A range of recent research discussed in Section 5 aims to explain how ICL works, and observations on the self-reinforcement effect could help shed light -- and indeed the paper hints at this repeatedly (e.g., end of page 4, \"In the context of ICL, this pattern corresponds to demonstrations like\" -- it seems that the experiment is understood as some kind of simple prompt-like structure, but this idea and its implications are then not made explicit)."

The same question about how masked subsequences are resampled also applies to the other experiments.\n\n- Section 4.1, \"Learning to follow patterns\" -- when masking the Question, does this mean that the questions in the demonstrations are masked (i.e., replaced with random word sequences) but the question in the final element of the prompt (the one to respond to) is not masked?"
