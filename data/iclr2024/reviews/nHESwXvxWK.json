The key problem is to faithfully sample from the underlying posterior distribution.  It is not straightforward to integrate a likelihood into SGMs since it is difficult to consider a closed-form for the likelihood due to the dependence on time and thus noise level.  Existing approaches address this issue by various approximations (e.g. data consistency projections) but as far as I'm aware, and as the authors also state, no existing method fully solves this problem.  The authors claim they present the first provably consistent algorithm for condional sampling from the target posterior.  While I haven't checked all of the mathematical details I believe this is indeed the case.  Numerical experiments indeed confirm for the simple distributions that the sliced Wasserstein distance between the proposed method and the posterior recovered either analytically or by NUTS sampling is considerably smaller than for other SGM approaches for solving inverse problems."

From looking at the source, the diffusion code seems to be based on DDPM, which is not acknowledged in the main text or appendices. Speed issues have not been mentioned.\nThe bibliography is excellent except for the first paragraph of the introduction. Linear inverse problems as described have been studied mathematically for a very long time (Fredholm, etc) and in computer vision since the late 1980s at least.
