For a general audience, the word \u201cagent\u201d, \u201cpersona\u201d (defined, but defined upon \u201cagent\u201d), \u201ctruthfulness\u201d should be better defined. It\u2019s even better if such definitions are highlighted. \n2.\tI like Figure 2 (b) that you are comparing the 65% F1 with other time steps. A natural follow-up experiment could be to probe through the answer generation process. I bet the F1 should be higher than 65%. It will tell us that the persona the model puts on is also formed during the decoding process stochastically.\n3.\tThe fine-tuning experiments aren\u2019t informative/surprising. We have known this from inference-time intervention (Li et al. 2023) How does your finetuning performance compare to their TruthfulQA results? But again, I could be biased on this because I\u2019ve already fully agreed with your hypothesis.\n4.\tMost importantly, I\u2019m afraid this submission lacks novelty. Specifically, given Andreas 2022 proposing a wider hypothesis, Burns et al. 2022 show truthfulness could be probed from internal activations, Li et al. 2023 show there is a simple trick to boost the truthfulness of LLM. Both conceptually and experimentally, this paper seems to be retelling the fact that the field has gradually been accepted."

                "value": "The paper has a few confusing aspects to me.\n\n1. First of all, the terminology \"persona\" -- my thinking around persona has been mostly influenced by Social Simulacra [1], using constructed persona profiles as prompts for LLMs and controlling what the LLMs generate. At first, I thought the paper was discussing persona in the same way, but from the experiment and even from Figure 1, it is hard to tell what is the \"truthful\" or \"untruthful\" persona the paper is referring to. Can the authors explain by persona, do they mean a concrete part of the LLM (i.e., a prompt or an embedding at a particular token position?) To alleviate confusion, maybe choose a slightly different wording?\n\n2. The paper cited Jacob Andrea's LLMs as Agent Models. The hypothesis says, \"There exists a group of agents who are more truthful than others,\" and suggests that \"By modeling this truthful persona, language models can.\" Does this suggest that LLMs model persona and each persona is an agent? The hypothesis does not make enough sense to me. Where is this group of agents? Is it implicitly defined by LLMs' weights? Is it defined by the prompt (hypothesis seems to suggest \"Wikipedia and Science\" to be personas/agents)? The paper would be hugely improved if authors could clearly define what they mean by agent and by persona. \n\n3. Section 3, the two setups -- the most significant difference is the first setup, two agents are FULLY truthful, and two agents are FULLY dishonest. The other setup is partially truthful. I don't think this setup proves the hypothesis -- A lot of untruthful information, or if we think about conspiracy stories, often have a shroud of truth in the story and then mix them with lies. This truthful persona setup (that supports your hypothesis) is not close to reality -- but please feel free to showcase why you think it's closer to the actual training data of LLMs. \n\n4. Would it be more interesting if the authors could extract these personas and visualize them? Or show how fine-tuning or ICL can actually force LLMs always to adopt a truthful persona. I guess this requires the authors to define what a persona is, but it's very unclear what they mean from this paper.\n\n[1] Park, Joon Sung, et al. \"Social simulacra: Creating populated prototypes for social computing systems.\" Proceedings of the 35th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology. 2022."
