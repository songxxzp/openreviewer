The paper goes on to present a method to facilitate likelihood modelling with cascaded diffusion by introducing *hierarchical volume-preserving maps*, allowing to express the model likelihood as a joint likelihood over different hierarchical scales. In practice, this includes wavelet and Laplacian pyramid transforms. The paper also proposes a surprising connection with the denoising score matching loss over the different scales of the hierarchical maps and optimal transport. The new models show impressive performance in model likelihoods on CIFAR-10 & different-resolution ImageNet datasets, out-of-distribution detection and lossless compression."

                "value": "### On the connection to the EMD metric:\n- Given that it is the central part of the proof, I would like more elaboration on how exactly the connection to Theorem 2 of Shirdhonkar & Jacobs is made. One way to do this would be to repeat the theorem and its assumptions in the paper and showing step-by-step how does it apply here. In particular, I wasn\u2019t able to see how do the $2^{-j(s+n/2)}$ terms in their statement of the Theorem connect to the application of it in the paper. \n- What exactly does the paper claim by making the connection with score matching on wavelet representations and EMD? The last sentence of section 5.2. seems to claim that the method allows training diffusion models with the EMD measure, which does not quite seem to be the case here. While the connection between wavelets and EMD is definitely interesting, the connection to diffusion models doesn't seem particularly important as of now.\n### On the ELBO and the necessity of volume-preserving maps:\n- I might be confused, but it seems to me that volume-preserving maps are not necessary to form an ELBO with cascaded diffusion models. My thinking is as follows: We have the data $x$, and S sequences of latent variables $z_{1:T}^s$ with different resolutions and noise levels. The generative process, as defined in the paper, is $p_\\theta(x,z)=p(x|z_1^S)\\prod_{s=1}^S\\prod_{t=2}^T p_\\theta(z_{t-1}^s|z_{t}^s,z_1^{(<s)})p(z_T^s)$. We can then form the following inference process that is factorized for the different resolutions: $q(z|x) = \\prod_{s=1}^S \\prod_{t=2}^T q(z_t^s|z_{t-1}^s)q(z_1^s|x)$. Here $q(z_1^s|x)$ downsamples $x$ and adds the smallest level of noise in the diffusion process. Now if we form the ELBO, we get: $E_q[-\\log p_\\theta(x)]\\leq E_q[-\\log\\frac{p_\\theta(x,z)}{q(z|x)}]=E_q[-\\log \\frac{p_\\theta(x|z_1^S)\\prod_{s=1}^S\\prod_{t=2}^Tp_\\theta(z_{t-1}^s|z_t^s,z_1^{(<s)]})p(z_T^s)}{\\prod_{s=1}^S \\prod_{t=2}^T q(z_t^s|z_{t-1}^s)q(z_1^s|x)}]$, and further $=E_q[-\\log p_\\theta(x|z_1^S) - \\sum_{s=1}^S[\\sum_{t=2}^T\\log\\frac{p_\\theta(z_{t-1}^s|z_t^s,z_t^{(<s)})}{q(z_t^s|z_{t-1}^s)} + \\log p(z_T^s) - \\log q(z_1^s|x) ]]$. From here, we can follow the standard derivation to get to the KL divergences (e.g., Appendix A in Ho et al., Eq.19., with the difference that their $x_{1:T}$ is redefined to $z_{1:T}^s$ and $x_0$ to $x$). I think this results in the same ELBO as in the submission, with the difference that instead of having a $p(x|z)$ term for each scale, this would only have it for the last scale. Do the authors agree with this point of view, or have I potentially misunderstood something? In case I have not misunderstood, this seems to be a major issue with the paper, since there is no comparison to cascading diffusion models without volume-preserving maps, making the significance of volume-preserving maps unclear. \n\n## Overall\n\nWhile the paper is well-written, the method showcases improvements and is well-evaluated, I hesitate to give an accepting score before I can see more clearly what is the benefit of volume-preserving maps. It is possible that I have missed something, and if so, I am willing to raise my score. Otherwise, I think that the paper requires more elaboration on what exactly is the role of volume-preserving maps in likelihood training of cascaded diffusion models. I would also like to see a clearer derivation for the EMD metric connection, as well as more elaboration on what is the significance of the connection. \n\nReferences:\nHo et al., Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, NeurIPS 2020"

                "value": "- The theoretical setting of the paper is general, with possibly non-linear volume-preserving maps $h$, but in practice only linear $h$ are used, which thus boil down to using an orthogonal transform (for wavelets) or a tight frame (for Laplacian pyramid). The linear setting already leads to important improvements, and the possibility of the extension to non-linear maps is interesting for future research, but it obfuscates slightly the results of the paper behind unnecessary complexity. In particular, using \"Hierarchical volume-preserving maps\" in the title instead of a more explicit reference to orthogonal wavelet transforms (which yield the best results) does not accurately describe the contents of the paper and makes it harder for the reader to connect the contributions of the paper to known concepts. Orthogonal transforms are not mentioned anywhere before page 6, yet are the core component of the method.\n- Related to the previous point, orthogonal wavelets have been used for multiscale generative modeling in several missed previous works: see [1] for nomalizing flows, [2] for direct likelihood modeling, and [3] for diffusion models (closest to the setting of the paper, though the focus is on image quality rather than likelihood modeling). In particular, [1] and [2] critically rely on the orthogonality of the transform to model the likelihood. Also, the recombination of $z^{(<s)}$ into a same-resolution image mentioned in Appendix B is crucially used by [1-3] to parameterize efficiently the conditional likelihood.\n- The connection to the earth's mover distance seems problematic to me. First, it is unclear what benefits it brings to the paper: I do not understand how to interpret Theorem 5.1, since here the transport is between the true and approximated scores (seen as distributions on $\\mathbb R^2$), as opposed to transport between distributions of images as is usually the case. Second, the soundness of the results look questionable to me. For instance, the Wasserstein-p distance is defined between probability distributions, which thus requires that the scores have non-negative entries that sum to one. The authors do not mention this restriction anywhere in the paper. Second, the proof seems to assume that the wavelet coefficients of the image score $\\nabla \\log q(x)$ are the wavelet conditional scores $\\nabla \\log q(z^{(s)} | z^{(<s)})$, but this is not the case. Indeed, one has $\\log q(x) = \\log q(z^{(1)}) + \\log q(z^{(2)} | z^{(1)})$ (with $S = 2$ for simplicity), and thus the $z^{(1)}$ component of the image score includes an additional term coming from the high-frequency score component (called \"free energy\" in [2]). For this reason, the equivalence between wavelet and Laplacian pyramid for the score matching losses also breaks down (which is a more plausible explanation for the difference in performance than the authors' footnote 1).\n\nDespite these weaknesses, I recommend acceptance (see Strengths above). I am willing to increase my score if the authors address these points.\n\n[1] Jason J Yu, Konstantinos G Derpanis, and Marcus A Brubaker. \u201cWavelet Flow: Fast Training of High Resolution Normalizing Flows.\u201d In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020.\n\n[2] Tanguy Marchand, Misaki Ozawa, Giulio Biroli, and Stephane Mallat. \u201cWavelet Conditional Renormalization Group.\u201d\n\n[3] Florentin Guth, Simon Coste, Valentin De Bortoli, and Stephane Mallat. \"Wavelet score-based generative modeling.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022."

How do the authors deal with this difficulty, and how is Lemma 4.1 not meaningless in this case?\n- The authors mention switching to a different architecture and weighting scheme for optimizing FID as opposed to likelihood. Does the improvement in FID come with an increase in BPD? If so, the tradeoff between the two should be acknowledged explicitly.\n- Why not using $M=1$ in the OOD detection task? In high-dimensions, we expect from concentration of measure that $-\\log p(x) \\approx \\mathbb H(p(x))$ for almost all $x$, so we should be able to detect changes in distribution from just one sample?\n\nMinor suggestions:\n- Multiscale image modeling has a much older history than 2017, e.g., [4-10] for a very incomplete list, which seems more relevant than the reference [Horstemeyer, 2010]. Though these earlier works generally focus on other tasks such as denoising or compression, the motivations for using a multiscale representation remain the same.\n- Line before equation (5) should read $\\log p_\\theta(x_0)$ instead of $p_\\theta(x_0)$.\n- Any linear map could be used for cascaded likelihood modeling, even if its determinant is not one (as long as it is not zero). Indeed, it just introduces a constant offset in the likelihood, which has no effect for training, and this offset can be estimated once offline for test-time likelihood evaluation. In particular, the standard cascaded hierarchy is in this case.\n- The discussion below Definition 1 should state that it requires $\\mathrm{dim} \\mathcal{Z} \\geq \\mathrm{dim} \\mathcal{X}$ with a full-rank Jacobian $\\mathrm{rank}(A) = \\mathrm{dim} \\mathcal{X}$. Also, the convention used for the Jacobian matrix should be stated to avoid confusions with its transpose: i.e., $A \\in \\mathbb R^{\\mathrm{dim} \\mathcal{Z} \\times \\mathrm{dim} \\mathcal{X}}$.\n\n\n[4] P J Burt and E H Adelson.

It\u2019s not clear what the terms in eq 9 even mean or how they are defined, and the dependency issue of the joint still remains.\n- In eq 10 the h is now some kind of linear operator, while earlier it was a function. Is the idea that h(x)=h*x? It would be good to clarify the distinction between function h and operator tensor h.\n- What does * mean in (j*2)? Is this a product or convolution? If this is a convolution, what does it mean to convolve j with 2?\n- What does fig 2 show? I think it shows y^4 and z^3...z^1. Can you clarify?\n- What does tight frame mean? Can you give a conceptual explanation? What does \u201ch\u201d mean in parseval equation? There is no \u201ch\u201d in the Laplace section of the paper at all: does some of this stuff (y,z,d,u) relate to h?\n- Again, what is the \u201cmapping\u201d h in Wavelet case? Is it the z\u2019s, or y\u2019s, or them together, or something else?\n- The wavelet and Laplacian pyramids both retain the original resolution of the image. Wasn\u2019t the goal of this paper to reduce resolution? I\u2019m a bit confused. Can you clarify the notion of resolution vs scale, and clarify which one you want to reduce? The very first sentence of the paper in introduction talks about super-resolution, which leads me to believe that one should change resolution somewhere in the paper, but neither of the transform types seems to change resolution. Can you clarify these aspects?\n- I don\u2019t see what lemma 4.1. has to do with eq 15. It seems that you just apply the x=z1\u2026zS substitution and use chain rule to split the p(x) to p(zs|z_<s). Where is lemma 4.1 here? Also, the paper has already defined p(x) in eq 7, which seems to conflict with the p(x) in eq 15. Can you clarify? Is this a redefinition, or are both true?\n- What is the q in eq 16?\n- What is z_0^s in eq 16? How do you get them? How do you get the z_1\u2019s? How do you get the z_k\u2019s? What are the terms here: I can\u2019t really follow any of them. Can you explain all three terms (the logp and two KLs). For instance, the regular logp term is the probability of observed image given z^1 while marginalising all intermediate states away. Here isntead we have p(z^s_0 | z_1^s, z_0^<s). So we are looking at one scale likelihood, but somehow conditioning with earlier scale \u201cobservations\u201d? I can\u2019t really follow at all what is happening, since very little of eq 16 or the underlying processes have been defined or characterised. Please include an algorithm boxes for training and sampling. It\u2019s also confusing what is h here.\n- I\u2019m having hard time understanding what the eq 18 is conceptually representing. Is the idea that criss-cross the pixels from one image to another by moving the pixel locations around?\n- Eq 19 is a lot of stuff without much motivation, introduction or exposition. I have hard time understanding what this means or how it connects with the paper. Somehow optimising the scale losses is equivalent to reordering pixel locations in the scores\u2026? Err.. what? This feels very strange, and I can\u2019t follow. I also don\u2019t see why this is significant: what are you trying to argue here? How do we benefit from this connection? If you want to present this theoretical connection, it needs to be presented in a way that is digestable, and requires more exposition and explanation, and also helpful illustrations.\n- At experiments I still don\u2019t know what does the function \u201ch\u201d mean in this paper, or what it is. I guess it\u2019s the Laplace pyramid, but not sure which part. I\u2019m also not sure how did we now solve the problem of joint needing to be marginalised to only evaluate the final image. I can\u2019t really connect the problem statement in introduction to the methods presented in the paper. I think the paper needs a method summary section that explains how all the pieces come together to solve the original problem, while including an algorithm box.\n- The paper should cite to simple diffusion, that also tackles multi-resolution.\n- In experiment the key comparison is how does this method fare against diffusion models that utilise laplace or wavelet pyramids; or have an explicit super-resolution component. Looking at table 1 almost all comparison targets are irrelevant old methods, and I fail to see many if any super-resolution/laplace/wavelet methods. There is only a single comparison to a 2022 method, and none to 2023. Given the astronomical pace of the research in diffusion, this is not acceptable. The paper needs to compare both to (i) other super/wavelet/laplace diffusion models, and more comprehensively to 2022 and 2023 diffusion models. The claims of state-of-the-art performance is unsubstantiated.\n- The OOD experiments only seem to compare to quite old generative models. Why not compare to other diffusion models? Wasn\u2019t the point of the paper to improve the multi-scale handling of diffusion models, so surely one should then compare to other diffusion models with more adhoc multi-scalings, or to diffusion models with a single scale only. I\u2019m also not sure what the table 2 rows mean.\n- In 6.3. there are comparisons to uni-scale diffusion models (which is great), but one should also compare to competing multi-scale diffusion models."

                "value": "This paper proposes the cascaded diffusion models for high-fidelity image synthesis that also works as a likelihood model, by overcoming the intractability issue of the likelihood function in multi-scale diffusion models. To do this, this paper provides some hierarchical model of the latent variables, to reduce the marginal likelihood problem into the cascaded conditional likelihood problem. To do this, a class of transformations called hierarchical volume-preserving maps. Some special yet natural instances of the hierarchical volume-preserving maps include Laplacian pyramids, where the image data is divided into its low-pass filter part and its counterparts sequentially, and the wavelet decomposition, which is more general and more rank-preserving transformation, first orthogonalize the image into four filters (low-low, low-high, high-low, high-high) which is also called subbands. Then, the subbands that include high-pass filter in at least one coordinate (vertical or horizontal) is kept and low-low subband is hierarchically downsampled and again taken the wavelet transform. \n\nThen, the likelihood training of this cascaded diffusion model is done by the factorization of the variational objective of the diffusion model into the sum of the conditional variational objective with respect to each hierarchical latent variables. Finally, the paper suggests the connection of this paper to the optimal transport concept, by providing that the Wasserstein-p distance between the approximate and exact score is upper-bounded by the cascaded diffusion objective. The experiments show that the cascaded volume-preserving diffusion model yields better likelihood measure compared to other existing flow-based models and diffusion models. Furthermore,"
