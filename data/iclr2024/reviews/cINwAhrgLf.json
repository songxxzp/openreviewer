The authors achieve this by designing an asymmetric network and further develops two algorithms: the first algorithm directly uses the asymmetric primary-to-auxiliary architecture, where the auxiliary tasks can be directly removed during the inference; the second algorithm initiates with an architecture with bi-directional connections, and subsequently exploits a tailored L1 constrained NAS optimization to prune all the auxiliary-to-primary connections, thereby enabling to remove the auxiliary task during inference. The proposed soft-parameter sharing architecture-based method can be integrate with existing optimization-based methods. The author validates their method with extensive experiments on 6 tasks with 3 CNN and transformer architectures."

The paper is well written and easy to understand, with an extensive literature review in Table 1 clearly demonstrating the contribution of the proposed method.\n2. The evolving and asymmetric network design, coupled with a tailored NAS algorithm, ensures the converged network comprises only the primary-to-auxiliary connections, thereby guaranteeing a single-task inference cost for the learned architecture.\n3. Beyond the benefits in the single-task inference cost, the authors also show (in Sect. 4.2.4 and the supplementary) that the training complexity exhibits a linear scalability to multiple auxiliary tasks.\n4. The experiments are extensively performed on 6 highly diverse tasks with 3 base net architectures including CNN and transformers. The authors also checked the performance when the primary and the auxiliary tasks possess different architectures in the supplementary. The results of all those experiments are promising."

As a result, the proposed method achieves a multi-task level performance while keeping a single-tasks level inference cost. The authors implement their design as adaptive layerwise feature fusion of multiple single-task branches, where the full network converges to an asymmetric architecture with only primary-to-auxiliary connections existed, enabling the removal of the auxiliary task during the inference. Two algorithms are developed to achieve this, where the more advanced one exploits a specifically designed NAS pruning to achieve an asymmetric architecture after convergence. The experiments are extensive across 6 tasks with 3 network backbone architectures, which sufficiently demonstrate the promising performance."

The authors offer an exhaustive overview of both Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and Auxiliary Learning (AL) methods. Authors have incorporated a wide range of references from multiple years, indicating a holistic survey of both seminal works and recent advancements. The inclusion of their method alongside existing techniques also provides clarity on its positioning within the broader research landscape. \n\n++ The proposed method is backbone- and task-agnostic that is applicable to multiple backbones and tasks."

                "value": "-- I am not very familiar with auxiliary learning. However, I do think one baseline might be meaningful, which is to share a single backbone while projecting the gradient of the auxiliary task to the orthogonal direction of the main task on all (or selective) layers. This baseline also has no inference lag while exploiting the auxiliary objective signals. \n\n-- The authors use NAS to search for suitable architectures to optimize the main task's objective. However, distinct backbones are used for each task, and their weights can vary significantly. I'm uncertain why \"stitching\" two backbones with different weights and objectives is logical. Are there any supporting theories or references?\n\n-- The authors claim that their method achieves \"promising performance.\" However, based on Tables 3 and 4, it appears that the performance gain of the proposed method is only marginal. Considering the additional training costs in the NAS search and optimization, I am not sure whether the loss in training efficiency is worth it."
