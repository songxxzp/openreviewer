                "value": "The paper presents PRoM, a method to learn pseudo-rotation matrices. The motivation is that the paper claims that learning rotation matrices in a deep learning framework suffers from imposing orthonormality constraints by means of SVD or Gram-Schmidt. The proposed method removes these orthogonalization methods and apply the estimated rotation matrix. The paper presents a mathematical analysis discussing the reasons about why SVD or Gram-Schmidt suffer when applied in a deep learning framework. The paper presents experiments on various applications (e.g., human pose estimation and point cloud pose estimation) showing that PRoM outperforms the included baselines."

Lack of discussion about other possible ways to constrain orthonormality in learning problems. While the problems of orthogonalization in the learning problem may bring issues as described in the paper, there are other possible solutions that the paper does not discuss. For example: \n\ni) In 3D computer vision, some camera-pose estimation solvers constrain the rotation with $I - M^{\\intercal}M$ and $\\text{det}(M)=1$ pose problems and showing good estimation results (see Reference [A]). Why couldn't this trick replace the SVD or Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedures? Although, the paper does not discuss a learning approach, the trick is applicable to any learning problem. Unfortunately, the paper lacks discussion about these tricks and if they also present problems when learning.\n\nii) Learning rotation with neural networks does not need to follow the pipeline shown in Figure 1. One can easily use a quaternion parametrization, remove $\\mathcal{L}_{\\theta}$ and thus remove the orthogonalization, and simply add a regularizer term that enforces the norm of the quaternion be one.\n\n2. The continuity issues discussed in the submission and that are used to motivate the problem are questionable. One of the main claims of the paper in Learning for Rotations in Section 2 states that the parametrization of 3D rotations with four or fewer dimensions is discontinuous and non-ideal for learning (according to Zhou et al. 2019). However, Zhou et al. 2019 defines the continuity concept from an intuitive example and lacks solid theorems showing that these definitions and observations strictly apply to learning rotations. Subsequent works using quaternions show that they work well with neural networks (see Reference [B] below). Reference B conflicts with the observations of Zhou et al. which is the foundation of this work and explore pseudo-rotation matrices. Thus, this puts into question the main assumptions stated in Section 2.\n\n3. The paper would've been more solid if they included the discussed methods in 1 (see above).\n\nReferences.\n[A] Ventura, Jonathan, et al. \"A minimal solution to the generalized pose-and-scale problem.\" CVPR. 2014.\n[B] Zhang et al.

Since the proposed method is not a novel framework, it is generally applicable to any existing methods for pose estimation. Hence, I assume that PROM could be used together with baselines to also improve learning. \n\n3. In the area of camera pose regression, it has been shown that predicting pseudo rotation matrix during training works in [3] and quantanion without orthogonalization is also possible [4].

This method seems to be very simple, simply removing the $r$ and $g$. why is removing $r$ possible? If I understand correct, $r$ is the mapping from input to rotation representation, and should not be identity mapping. \n3. My biggest concern is: if orthogonalization can be safely removed as suggested by this work, why the previous work adopted GS or SVD to make the rotation representation valid?"

I see that the authors have removed some wrong derivations, but there are still many vague and wrong claims in the paper.\n\n- Most claims in the paper are either vague or not surprising (not showing what the authors intended to show). Most importantly, the proposed method (using a plain 3x3 matrix without any orthogonalization and instead guiding it to a rotation matrix using an additional loss, i.e., soft constraint) is a somewhat basic technique that has been frequently used in the literature. Accordingly, I'm afraid the paper has little merit to the research community. The detailed errors (or concerns I have) are listed below:\n\n- Section 3.4.1 (and Appendix A.3) basically says that (5) has two more terms other than the first term, so the gradient can be scrambled. The claim itself is vague, but before that, what the authors need to show is not that there are two more terms, but that these two terms do not die out (and actually steer the overall gradient towards funny directions) in the majority of the input space. In (12)-(16), we can actually see that there are many duplicating expressions, as well as many terms related to cross-product, inside those three terms. This suggests that the two terms (related to $r_2$ and $r_3$) might actually be canceled, either by themselves or by combining the two. I actually showed this in my previous review for a specific case provided in the previous manuscript. This might hold for larger regions in the input space if we do the manipulation. The authors must explicitly derive against this to justify their claim, not suggesting them as in the current paper.\n\n- Theorems in Section 4.2 are not surprising, and most importantly, they do not prove anything. What they are showing are (specific) upper bounds of losses for orthogonalized and unorthogonalized cases. This does not guarantee anything. They do not guarantee that the actual loss will be lower for the unorthogonalized case, and moreover, there is no proof that they are the best upper bounds we can have (so it is not correct to say that the unorthogonalized case has a better chance of a lower loss).\n\n- The meaning of Fig. 3 is vague. It simply shows that the correlation between the gradient and $t_{11}$ is not apparent in Euclidean space. This has nothing to do with the stability or ambiguity of the gradient. More importantly, it is obvious that the relation between the gradient and the parameter is more complex for orthogonalization than for plain identity mapping.\n\n- What if we do not have ground truth rotations? Without $L_\\theta$, it is possible that PRoM deviates too far from the rotation space, and this can be detrimental to having a correct solution. What should we do then?"
