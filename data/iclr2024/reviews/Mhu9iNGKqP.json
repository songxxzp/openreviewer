In terms of the FHE ciphertext evaluation, the authors propose modulating the ciphertext moduli-chain layer-wise to reduce the inference time.

The authors give a detailed mathematical analysis of the polynomial approximation method and dynamic programming design.\n2. The authors propose a moduli-chain management method to achieve additional reductions in inference runtime. This method focuses on removing unused moduli. Instead of using a single moduli chain, the authors propose to use multiple moduli chains for each depth of the activation approximation polynomial function. In this way, this paper can reduce the number of bootstrapping operations."

Given that the method determines the appropriate polynomial degree for each layer, its computational complexity varies depending on the network's depth. This adaptability makes it increasingly impractical for deeper networks, such as ResNet101 and ResNet152. In contrast, the complexity of PI-specific manual ReLU pruning depends solely on the number of stages within the networks and remains independent of the total number of layers.\n\nAdditionally, the authors must have included a comparative analysis of their approach's complexity with previous methods that involve retraining, with a focus on absolute time, to demonstrate the advantages of their method, which eliminates the need for retraining.\n\n$\\bullet$ **Lack of comprehensive empirical evaluation:**  The experimental evaluation in the paper is limited to CIFAR-10 using ResNet20 and ResNet32 networks. As per the standard practice in PI [1, 2, 3], an evaluation on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet datasets with networks such as ResNet18 should have been included to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution on complex datasets. \n\n\n$\\bullet$ **Comparison with prior work:** To demonstrate the superiority of the HE-only solution over a hybrid approach (HE + MPC) [1, 2, 3],  a comparative analysis of the end-to-end PI runtime is required. Also, a discussion on low-degree polynomial substitution should have been included, which has been shown to be effective even on complex datasets such as [4]. \n\n\n**In conclusion,** I question the practicality of using higher-degree polynomials, especially considering their need for extensive bootstrapping when compared to the hybrid approach (HE/VOLE for linear layers and GC/OT for ReLUs).

This has been achieved by tying it to minimizing the variance of the loss function.\n\n2) A dynamic-programming based method has been proposed to determine \"optimal\" polynomial degree in each layer of a neural network.

                "value": "1) Two key claims in the paper have been stated without any strong validation.\n\na) Firstly, what is the guarantee that the input to the ReLU activation layer will always follow a normal distribution? Is this true for every layer of the neural network? What happens if this assumption does not hold?\n\nb) More importantly, why is the \"variance of the loss\" a good surrogate for the classification accuracy? The challenge in encrypted domain inference is not sensitivity to small approximation errors. Contrarily, even a single large (unbounded) approximation error can screw up the entire inference process (as observed in the bit-flip attack on machine learning models). This is reason we need some bound on the approximation error (leading to the minimax formulation).\n\n2) It is well-established in the literature on MPC-based private inference that not all ReLUs are equally important in the inference process. For example, see Peng et al., \"AutoReP: Automatic ReLU Replacement for Fast Private Network Inference\", ICCV 2023 and the references therin. In fact, the literature on MPC-based private inference does not stop layer-wise and tries to find exactly which particular neuron requires more accurate approximation. \n\na) It is important to acknowledge the progress made on ReLU reduction in the field of MPC-based private inference because it is directly relevant to the problem considered in this work.\n \nb) Can the proposed dynamic programming approach be scaled one step further to find the optimal polynomial degree for each specific neuron?\n\n3) The results indicate that there is orders of magnitude decrease in the max. polynomial degree (see Table 3), which is surprising not reflected in the max. depth as well as the overall inference time. There should be a more in-depth analysis of how the max. polynomial degree impacts the inference time because that forms the core motivation for this work."
