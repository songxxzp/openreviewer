                "value": "$\\bullet$ **Novelty of the method:** The proposed approaches for improving ReLU efficiency at the expense of FLOPs count are not novel at all. Previous work, such as CryptoNAS and Sphynx, has already explored this concept by maintaining a constant ReLU count per layer, which in turn increases the FLOPs count (however, these studies did not provide detailed FLOPs count information). Furthermore, this paper fails to introduce any fresh insights or observations that shed light on how networks can trade ReLUs for FLOPs. The insights presented in Section 4.4 of the paper are already well-established.\n\n$\\bullet$ **FLOPs-cost are ignore:** This is the core-issue with the paper. The authors presented the results with online latency and ignored their impact on end-to-end latency, a trend also seen in works like SENet, SNL, Sphynx, DeepReDuce, and CryptoNAS. Nonetheless, these prior work on PI improved the ReLU efficiency of the given baseline networks (mostly ResNets and WideResNets) *without increasing their FLOPs counts* (Although WidResNets have 4x to 5x higher FLOPs than ResNets). \n\nDelphi assumes that no matter how many FLOPs are there in networks, they can be processed offline. However, in real-world scenarios, private inference requests arrive at non-zero rates. Even at low arrival rates, processing the entire FLOPs offline becomes impractical due to limited computing resources, storage, communication bandwidth between server and client, and time constraints arising from the non-zero request-arrival rate. Consequently, offline costs are no longer truly offline, and FLOPs start affecting real-time performance, as illustrated in Figure 7 of the paper [1]. This effect can be exacerbated by networks with higher FLOP counts, as proposed by the authors.\n\n\n**The argument of online vs. offline latency is only valid if the optimization is performed for a single private inference in isolation.** FLOP penalties can only be disregarded when there are no inference arrivals or when an accelerator offering more than 1000x speedup is employed. Even with complete FLOP parallelization, such as using LPHE in [1], end-to-end performance improves but does not eliminate FLOP costs.\n\nThe authors cite [1] to support the claim that ReLU is 300x costlier than FLOPs, but this argument is valid only for online overhead. When considering end-to-end latency, FLOPs are shown to be 4.8x more expensive than ReLUs, as demonstrated in Table 1 of [1]. Therefore, the authors should have provided a FLOPs comparison with ResNet18, WRN22x8, and CryptoNAS.\n\nIn summary, *this paper does not contribute any new perspectives on private inference and fails to advance the understanding of current gaps in the field, rendering it less relevant for the ICLR audience.*\n\n\n[1] Garimella et al., \"Characterizing and Optimizing End-to-End Systems for Private Inference,\" ASPLOS 2023."

While the NAS algorithm itself is novel, the lack of thorough discussion on security during its implementation and validation makes this paper appear incomplete as a paper on privacy-preserving AI.
