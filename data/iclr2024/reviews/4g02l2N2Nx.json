                "value": "The authors found that prior linear attentions miss two key properties of softmax attention that are crucial for good performance: having low-entropy (spiky) weights and maintaining dot-product monotonicity. A new learnable linear attention called Hedgehog was introduced. Hedgehog retains these crucial properties while keeping linear complexity. It uses trainable MLPs to produce attention weights similar to softmax attention. The results indicate that Hedgehog can achieve over 99% of the standard Transformer's performance, outdoing previous linear attentions in various settings."

The authors then investigate why this is the case, by studing the properties of the attention maps produced by full attention and linear approximations. They find that two properties in full attention that previous linear attention methods seem to lack:\n\n- low-entropy \"spiky\" attention weights\n- monotonicity over query-key dot products\n\nThe authors then attempt to measure the importance of these two properties by inducing these properties in some test tasks, finding that these properties seem to correlate with performance of the trained model.\n\nFinally, the authors propose Hedgehog: the core idea being using linear map from the query/key space into a lower-dimensional feature space, but learning this linear map to *explicitly* approximate the final attention maps produced by dense attention. \n\nExperimental results are quite convincing: Hedgehog outperforms most other linear attention methods on multiple tasks (including LM perplexity and popular downstream tasks), both when training models from scratch and when \u201clinearizing\u201d models with dense attention."

Previous work [1] has shown that linear attention approach are less amenable to scaling than dense attention (meaning as models get larger, the gap between dense and linear attention increases) and so it\u2019s unclear if this approach would still lead to such small gaps with dense attentions for 1B+ models (which IMO, is the main use case for this technique). While I already really liked the paper, I think this paper could be much stronger impact on the community if results were validated on larger LLMs.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10551.pdf"
