The authors propose a Bayesian estimation-based knowledge distillation method to alleviate the limitation of traditional knowledge distillation methods. And I really appreciate this work because the uncertainty plays an important role in language generation and  Bayesian based distribution estimation can be naturely used to solve this problem\n\nI have captured the main idea of this paper, but get lost in the motivation of technical details\n\n1. For prior estimation, I understand it as the authors wanna to obtain the probs of hard lable provided by close-form LLMs. The main question is how the authors to collect the corpus $C$, and will you use the given sequence (w_t, ..., I) as the prompt?\n\n2. For posterior estimation, what is the motivation of this part. I do understand why you update prior here. Moreover, why you process iteratively sampling on open-source LLMs to obtain the posterior distribution of given token? Further, for  open-source LLMs, the probs accross the whole vocabulary can be directly obtained and do need to be calculated like the estimation in Eq.2 and Eq.3\n\n3. Why you use KL as loss function, will it be different from cross entroy loss in normal LLMs training?"

Training on the entire corpus via cross-entropy appears the same as fitting the prior distribution.\n3. The $gamma$ term can smooth the distribution. Is the prior estimation step novel or basically the same as label smoothing?\n4. Assume the teacher distributions are available in the **posterior estimation** step, and there is no need to learn a proxy model. Will sampling from this teacher to get a posterior distribution help? You could run an experiment where the teacher is open-sourced. Will the posterior distribution be the same as the teacher-generated corpus distribution?\n5. Does the improvement from adding the posterior distribution actually due to the ensemble of the teacher and the proxy model?\n6. How important is the choice of the proxy model? Can you compare multiple options, present how well they fit the teacher model, their performance on held-out data compared to the teacher model, and how they affect the student performance?"

Then the authors further propose to estimate \"posterior\" probability by sampling a proxy open-source language model.
