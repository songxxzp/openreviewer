The main issue that the contribution tackles is the cost of running expensive queries on real hardware which can hinder learning efficiency (from a wall-time perspective) when training deep reinforcement learning agents. This becomes even more problematic in the case of query optimization where the search space is exponential and finding fast-executing query plans is NP-hard. The simulator uses precomputed exact cardinality for each of the possible plans in the search space, which offloads the cost of evaluating plan performance (and therefore collecting a reward) to the developers of the simulator rather than the user. The authors release the queries and intermediate relation cardinality estimates which can also be used for learning cardinality estimation models. Many RL algorithms are benchmarked using this RL environment."

Additionally, more traditional cost models which approximate the IR estimates such as the Postgres cost model should be evaluated to solidify that precomputing the IR estimates manually is necessary for strong performance. Ideally, showing a curve of environment cost vs. learning performance curve would be useful (e.g. does using real execution latencies improve over the exact IR cardinalities which improves over the Postgres cost model?).\n\nThe dataset for learning supervised cardinality estimators is not benchmarked against other methods for learning cardinality estimators (both supervised and unsupervised) and should be benchmarked to better contextualize the contribution for the broader ML and systems community as to the datasets potential impact with respect to training estimators."
