By treating the predictions from student and teacher models as vectors, the method utilizes the scale-invariant property of cosine similarity to optimize student learning. The authors also introduced the \"Cosine Similarity Weighted Temperature\" (CSWT) technique to enhance the knowledge transfer efficiency."

Does \"[:,j]\" mean by concatnating all vectors from 1 to j (if so, please refer to C3)? It said that p_s, p_t \\in R^{B\u00d7C} which is a matrix. How to compute the consin similarity for two matrix based on Eq (1)? \n\nC2. By the explanation in the below of Eq (3), it seems that the loss only focuses on one class j? I got the answer Yes from Eq (9). So it's suggested to make the definition clearer or reorganize the presentation order. It's better to explain all notations with a formal way without the assumption that audiences also understand what's presented.\n\nC3. Though cosine similarity is scale-invariant, the significance of a cosine similarity value depends on vector length (i.e., the dimension of the vector). For a 200-d vector, 0.4 may be a relative large value. But for a 5-d vector, 0.7 does not mean two vectors are similar. For classification, the number of classes and  batch size are two factors to affect the vector length. That means, even for the same task, for difference batch size, the proposed would get different student models.\n\nC4. The authors must take a long time to conduct extensive experiments in following sections to show the advantage of the proposed. However, concerns exist in the results due to unclear definitions and intuitions (please refer to C1 to C3)\n\n\n==========\n\nThe authors response help my understanding on the methodology. I would like to raise my review score.\n\nHowever, the concern is still on the batch-wise cosine similarity. Overall, I don't think it meet the acceptance bar."

Despite its significant effectiveness, the paper still faces several issues that currently place it significantly below the acceptance threshold for ICLR.                          \n\nIssues:\n1. The author's concept of cosine distance is commendable but lacks a comparison and discussion with existing KD methods based on KL divergence, such as SHAKE [1] and DKD [2]. Incorporating relevant comparative analysis in the next version would be beneficial.\n2. The paper does not adequately explore the relationship between the proposed method and existing KD techniques; it merely provides result comparisons. This leaves readers struggling to understand the unique significance of the proposed approach. A deeper discussion of the differences between these two types of KD methods is needed in the related work section.\n3. The motivation behind the entire loss function is unclear. While the author introduces a temperature parameter (T) in Equation 3, its specific setting is absent in subsequent explanations. In Equation 9, where two loss functions are introduced, there is only one balancing factor, leading to reader confusion.\n4. There are overall writing issues in the paper, including citation formatting and writing errors such as inconsistent tenses and mixed usage of abbreviations (e.g., Fig. vs. Figure, Table vs. Tab.). Careful proofreading and editing are required to enhance professionalism.\n5. Figure 4 lacks a detailed explanation, making it challenging for readers to understand the purpose of the experiment and the impact of batch size on the results. More background information and clarification are needed.\nI hope this feedback helps in further improving your research. \n\n[1] Shadow Knowledge Distillation: Bridging Offline and Online Knowledge Transfer. 2022.
