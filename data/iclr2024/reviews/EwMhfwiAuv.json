                "value": "In this paper, the authors introduce a novel layout control method called CAC (Cross-Attention Control) for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. CAC allows for precise control over the generated images' layout, including bounding boxes and segmentation maps, solely by manipulating the cross-attention maps during inference. Importantly, this technique is training-free and serves as an extension to existing T2I models. Experimental results demonstrate that CAC outperforms other methods like naive SD (Stable Diffusion), GLIGEN, and MultiDiffusion, showcasing its effectiveness in layout-controlled image generation."
