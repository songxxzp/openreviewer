I'm having difficulty understanding why an autoregressive policy structure is necessary for generating solutions to optimization problems involving a mix of continuous and discrete variables. While sequential structures are commonly used in reinforcement learning for combinatorial optimization problems to effectively learn policies for arbitrary problems, this study appears to be focusing on optimizing a specific given problem. In such a case, wouldn't it be more efficient to explore the entire solution space rather than constructing solutions sequentially?\n\n2. How is the order for selecting optimization variables determined, and does this order have the potential to affect the performance?\n\n3. Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) is a well-known class of optimization problems that involve optimizing both discrete and continuous variables, and many studies attempt to optimize MIPs using deep learning. How does this research differ from those studies involving MIPs?\n\n4. The experimental content seems limited. While three types of problems are presented, the first problem only compares the number of function evaluations, and the second problem presents curves indicating the improvement in solutions for a specific problem. It would be beneficial to solve a more diverse set of problems and provide statistical evidence to validate the performance."

The goal here is to tackle problems that involve predicting an object that has both discrete and continuous values such as a decision tree with selection of branching feature as well as the corresponding threshold, or producing a symbolic regression expression which is a combination of selected functions and constants. Their approach jointly produces both discrete symbol and a corresponding continuous value as opposed to previous work which focused on generating discrete backbones and then found the continuous values for the fixed skeleton. They evaluate their approach empirically by comparing against baselines that handle discrete and continuous decisions independently, as well as baselines from the literature for symbolic regression and interpretable RL (identifying a decision tree for solving simple RL problems). They demonstrate improved performance over previous approaches both in terms of solution quality, as well as in the efficiency as they require fewer calls to the evaluation metric to train their approach since the continuous variables don\u2019t need to be optimized separately."

However, it seems that this approach also may have misleading rewards for the skeleton or continuous solution if neither are optimal. It may shy away from high quality discrete solutions even though there may be one setting of continuous variables which are highly performant.\nIt is also unclear how this approach may work on more complicated discrete-continuous settings where the feasible region may be more complex such as in solving mixed integer linear programming, or in other cases where the continuous space may be more decoupled from the discrete space such as in cases where there are many continuous decisions that need to be made but not all of them have a corresponding discrete decision.\nAnother small limitation is that it would be helpful to see the applicability of this approach on more tasks that have hybrid domains such as real world use cases of symbolic regression."

Prior works follow a decoupled approach, where the discrete and continuous variables are modeled separately, leading to inefficiency in the sampling and optimization procedure. DisCO-DSO uses an autoregressive model and produces two latent variables, one is used to generate the discrete distribution, and the other is used to generate the continuous distribution. This method requires one evaluation step per sample, whereas prior approaches use black-box optimization methods to sample the continuous variable for each discrete token. Experiments are performed on a newly proposed parameterized bitstring task, symbolic regression for equations, and learning decision tree policies for RL. The experiments demonstrate competitive performance with existing methods while improving efficiency."
