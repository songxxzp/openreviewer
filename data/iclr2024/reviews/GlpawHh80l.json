To be more specific, we can stack the observations and obtain the sensing relation $X = V\\Pi + N$, where observation $X_i$ is the $i$th column of matrix $X$, and $N$ is the sensing noise. Easily, we can verify that $V\\Pi$ is a matrix with rank at most $K$. Hence, we can view matrix $X$ as a linear combination of low-rank matrix and noise matrix. Then, we exploit the research on low-rank matrix reconstruction and solve the problem. \n\n3.

The discussed problem is essential in many problems in ML/data analysis, e.g.: hypespectral unmixing, archetypal analaysis, and community detection in networks, topic modelling in NLP.\n\nThe *main innovation* is the *pseudo-point successive projection algorithm* (pp-SPA), which is the improvement of the well studied SPA method that is simple and effective. The proposed innovation consists of two parts: (i) in applying PCA to estimate the K-1 dimensional linear subspace defining the simplex (ii) to perform K-nearest neighbours averaging on the points. Both of these actions are meant to help with denoising of the given sample points and to help with correct estimation in high-noise settings.\n\nThe *main contribution* of the paper, apart from proposing the two denoise methods to SPA, comes from the supplied theoretical analysis. The authors show an upper bound on the error that depends on $K-1$th singular value of the matrix formed by the concatenated sampled points $X = [x_1,x_2, \\ldots x_n]$. This is a contrast to the existing bound that includes $K$th singular value in the work of (Gillis & Vavasis, 2013) that proved the first recovery bounds for the basic SPA algorithm. The authors claim that this is a significant difference, especially since the sampled points are guaranteed to lie in a $K-1$ lin. subspace, thus the $K-1$th singular value is bounded away from zero, while the $K$th singular value is not.\n\nThe *numerical comparisons* with the basic SPA and the related ablation studies are provided in the text and show benefits of the proposed methods in the specific cases of small $d=2$ and $K=3$, however, other situations of interest when the denoise function can be more pronounced, e.g., when d >> K is not showed. \n\nThe proofs seem to be technically involved, but it is difficult for me to check the soudness of the results as I am not an expert in the area."

The authors consider the (practical) problem of having noisy realisations $X_i = r_i + \\epsilon_i$ where $\\epsilon_i$ is some Gaussian noise.  This Gaussian noise assumption can be relaxed; the authors don't explain how, but looking at the proofs, I don't doubt that claim. \n\nWe are interested in writing each $r_i$ as a linear combination of $v_1, .., v_K$. This would ofcourse be trivial if we have access to $r_1, ..., r_n$, because we can find the extremal vertices $v_1, ..., v_K$, and then the problem amounts to solving a linear system of equation. Unfortunately, we only have access to the noisy $X_1, ..., X_n$, so finding the extremal vertices is not possible. Intuitively, we want to solve a linear system \"approximately\". \n\nThe existing algorithm for this problem is called SPA, or the successive projection algorithm. The algorithm starts with an empty extremal set K. at iteration $k$, given the current residual space, the algorithm projects all the points to the compliment of the previous residual space, then adds the vertex that maximizes the Euclidean norm greedily to the extremal set. \n\nThe authors claim that the current SPA algorithm has an issue of being biased outward bound. To counter this, they do a few contributions (in the paper):\n\n1) They introduce a new practical variant of the classical SPA algorithm, pp-SPA. This algorithm has two steps. First, it uses the fact that the points $r_1, ..., r_n$ lie on the same $K-1$ dimensional hyperplane $H$. So they project the noisy readings $X_1, ..., X_n$ onto the plane that minimizes the least square error with respect to the noisy realizations. Next, it \"averages\" each point using KNN to create more robustness and crease \"pseudo-points\". This is where the pp term in the algorithm name comes from. The algorithm seems to do better in practice.  \n\n2) The authors tighten the non-asymptotic bound for the classical SPA result from depending on $O(1/s_k^2)$ to $O(1/s_{k-1}^2)$ where $s_k$ is the $k$-th largest Eigen value of the extremal vertices $v_1, ..., v_K$.

The analysis for the SPA algorithm is a bit gross; I spent several days following the proof, it felt like a nightmare. I don't claim I understand all steps there, but otherwise the proof looked kosher to me. Perhaps spend some time on simplifying it, but that's easier said than done. \n\nOverall, I think that together with the new practical and nice pp-SPA algorithm that clearly does better in practice from the experiments, and the new non trivial theory to back it up, the paper is above acceptance threshold."

This result suggests that SPA is biased outward bound for this example! Why would this suggest it is a general phenomenon?! Actually, how do you know your own algorithm doesn't display this phenomenon for other examples?\n\n\n\"he triangles in black, green, and cyan are the true simplex (which is a triangle since (K \u22121) = 2), the simplex estimated by SPA, and the simplex estimated by D-SPA (D- SPA is a special case of pp-SPA where the projection step is skipped and pp-SPA is a new approach to be introduced; see below), respectively.\" Rewrite this sentence! \n\n\nPage 2 \"Roughly say\" --> Informally, ...\n\n\n\"successive projection algorithm (SPA) (Ara\u00b4ujo et al., 2001)\" The \"term\" successive projection algorithm might've originated from the Araujo paper from 2001, but I can't believe that this algorithm was first discovered in 2001. To start off, it has similarities to the Frank-Wolfe minimum norm point algorithm, and several polyhedral algorithms. Can you please verify where the original **idea** was derived, to keep historical accuracy? \n\nLemma 1 (Best-fit hyperplane) There is no way this result isn't known. I can literally prove this result without even looking at your Appendix with Lagrangian multipliers and straightforward linear algebra identities. Please search for where this result was first proved, and don't reprove old things unless your proof is starkly different (which is absolutely not the case here)"
