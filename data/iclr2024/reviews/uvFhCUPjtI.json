Furthermore, the proposed transform was shown to be robust to structural perturbations, and comprehensive simulations verified the utility of the transform when combined with some vanilla transformer models to perform link prediction tasks."

However, performing GFT over the entire spatio-temporal graph is typically computationally expensive, which hinders the spectrum analysis of spatio-temporal signals. This paper provided solid theoretical guarantees for using Evolving Graph Fourier Transform (EFT: DFT+GFT in order) to approximate the absolute decomposition (AD) with reasonably low approximation error. Standard properties of the transform are established in section 5.1 as well. For the simulations, it is also very interesting to see that EFT can be used within transformer models to perform sequential link prediction tasks in practice."

                "value": "The idea of decoupling spatial and temporal domains in spatio-temporal data analysis is actually not new, especially for the spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GCN) community. As a matter of fact, most existing ST-GCN models, no matter their design come from empirical perspectives [1, 2, 3] or theoretical perspectives [4, 5], all share the idea of graph-time decoupling to reduce the computational complexity. However, only a handful of prior works on ST-GCNs have been mentioned and discussed in the paper. I understand that the authors are considering graphs that change with time, for which most ST-GCNs are not directly applicable as they deal with static graphs, but I still believe related discussions should be added so that the readers are clearer about the contribution of this paper. Furthermore, the complexity of the proposed approach seems quite similar to those in [5]. The authors may also want to have some comments on that as well.\n\nIn addition, for the approximation of EFT to work, two extra assumptions are needed in place: 1) The rate of change of the graph with time is bounded; 2) The eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian at any given timestep and between timesteps have a multiplicity of 1. I think it is better to state these assumptions in the main text instead of the appendix to help the readers better understand the limit of the approach, as the assumptions are quite important (and intuitive) for the EFT to work.\n\n[1] Yan, Sijie, Yuanjun Xiong, and Dahua Lin. \"Spatial temporal graph convolutional networks for skeleton-based action recognition.\" Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence.
