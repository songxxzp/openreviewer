The reasons for **only** updating the (first) MLP layer in each transformer block are not sufficient. This paper ignores the discussion of other components, such as the attention block and normalization layers. The previous work [A] mentioned in this paper does not suggest that MLP layers are more important than other layers. \n\n    Besides, as for fine-tuning ViT, [B] suggested that \"fine-tuning attention is all you need\" since tuning attention weights are more efficient than tuning MLP parameters while reaching similar performance. It is supposed to include such discussion since this paper claims to find an efficient way for tuning foundation models. \n\n    On the other hand, the generalization of the Parameter Selection operation may be limited if it cannot automatically select parameters when all parameters of the transformer are included without the manual Localization operation.\n\n4. Missing comparisons and discussion. This work compares two baselines, FLYP [C] and ZSCL [D], in the main text (and two prompt-based methods in the appendix). Note that FLYP was not proposed for the continual setting. Therefore, this paper combines it with four continual learning methods, which makes sense. However, a closely related (but not mentioned) work [E] indicated that the pre-trained foundation model can naturally preserve generic knowledge even when tuning all parameters continually. It is supposed to include discussion and comparisons with [E] as a baseline to support this work. \n\n5.

IIUC SPU is a rather simple method and that should be a plus if presented as so. Unfortunately in my opinion that is not how the text presents it. E.g. no need to write the fixed decision of only using the first MLP layer as a phase of the algorithm, similar I think the text on the selection of parameters is a rather indirect way to say it selects the parameters with the highest absolute loss derivative computed on a sample of examples.\n\nIncomplete ablation: There is an ablation indicating that the first layer is better to update the parameters, however there appears to be no sweep of other hyper parameters such as the percentage of values being tuned. Similarly when comparing gradient vs learnable score it seems both have different tradeoffs of accuracy/forgetting and sweeping other parameters they could reach different tradeoffs.\n\nTrain cost efficiency: The gains on batch time are suspiciously high, which could be true in a specific hardware/configuration/batch size/communication/memory limitations/etc but maybe not representative of performance gains one would observe in a well tuned baseline.

                "value": "1\uff09The paper lacks sufficient theoretical support and generalization ability to explain how to identify the specific layers that need parameter updates. It is not sufficient to argue that only the parameters in the MLP layer need to be updated by pointing out that the MLP layer has the ability of pattern detection. The paper's final choice to update only the first MLP layer is determined by designing a permutation experiment. Imagine that when the number of layers to be selected becomes larger, determining the final position requires a large number of experiments. This indicates that there is no clear theoretical guidance for locating specific layers. When dealing with non-transformer-based models, the paper does not specify how to locate the specific layers that need to modify their parameters.\n\n\n\n2\uff09Neither of the two scoring functions designed in this paper stands out significantly. The paper points out that learnable scoring functions will improve gradient-based methods for a range of problems, at the cost of more computation. However, according to the experimental results in Table 3, it can be seen that the learnable function only has some advantages in the accuracy of the control set, and it can be seen from the data that this advantage is very small. This does not fully demonstrate that it eliminates some of the drawbacks of gradient-based scoring functions.\n\n3) On some key issues, the paper lacks in-depth analysis and experiments. First, the paper posits that parameters with a more substantial impact on gradients hold greater significance for new tasks, without further analyzing what these parameters represent and their specific relationship with new tasks and general knowledge. Second, other than localization and sparsity, the paper does not analyze much of how or why their method retains the generic knowledge but focuses more on the relationship of the model to new tasks. Third, in addition to the CLIP model, I suggest that experiments can be conducted on more foundation models, and the control set can not be limited to ImageNet, but select multiple representative datasets to reflect the experimental results."
