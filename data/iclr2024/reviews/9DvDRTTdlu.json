The paper also did not mentioned how these masks are obtained and how sensitive is the proposed method against the object mask segmentation accuracy.

A refinement layer is introduced to enable nearby pixel feature interactions thus enhancing rendering quality, while an adapted mask-aware DDS loss (compared to the common SDS loss) is utilized to distill the SD guidance more effectively and ease the color saturation and mode-seeking. Various ablations analysis, comparison to baselines have demonstrated its effectiveness and superior performance against previous methods."

The incorporation of DDS into 3D for ED-NeRF editing is a reasonable and innovative adaptation. This allows for more precise editing of implicit 3D models, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the edited results.\n\n3. The qualitative results presented in the paper demonstrate that the proposed technique can efficiently modify specific objects while preserving regions beyond the target objects. This is an improvement over baseline methods that often face difficulties in guiding the model toward the intended text.

Given that the \"Generate source image and latent feature map\" paragraph in Appendix A states their approach involves generating novel view images and extracting their latent feature maps, the time required for this procedure should also be reported and factored in when comparing with baseline approaches."

To this end, the latent NeRF representation is adopted, while the efficiency comparison with the existing methods is not shown in the main paper. Moreover, there is a lot of work for fast NeRF training/finetuning, which makes the improvement less interesting. \n3. The design of Refinement layers is straightforward to me, and it is more like adding some additional layers after the volume rendering, which is a normal way to improve the rendering quality. Moreover, from Fig. 2, it looks like some layers are adopted directly from the SD VAE. What's the benefit of such a desgin?\n4. In the experiment, most of the examples are about color changes or local texture editing. I am wondering whether the proposed method works for other 2D editing, such as the whole image style transfer or object replacement as shown in Instruct-NeRF2NeRF. Moreover, from Fig.4, we can see that compared to Instruct-NeRF2NeRF, the improvement lies in the accuracy of the editing for certain areas.
