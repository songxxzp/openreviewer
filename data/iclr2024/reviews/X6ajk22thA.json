The missing of the details make the results in the inductive setting unconvincing.\n\n    - I suggest the authors focus on the inductive setting rather than the transductive setting, where student MLPs can directly fit their teachers\u2019 outputs on testing nodes, as they are available to the students during training. This means that it is trivial for the students to achieve comparable performance to their teachers in the transductive setting."

The accuracy rankings in Figure 1.(a) are difficult to support the claim that distillation from a larger teacher with more parameters and high accuracy may be inferior to distillation from a smaller and less accurate teacher, as the used baselines share similar performance. For example, the authors report GCN outperforms GAT on the Cora dataset, while [1] reports GAT outperforms GCN on the Cora dataset. This is because their average accuracy is similar while the corresponding standard deviation is large (the avearages+-standard deviations of GCN and GAT on the Cora dataset are 81.88+-0.75 and 82.80+-0.47 respectively in [1]). Some suggestions are as follows.\n\t1. The authors may want to evaluate a statistically significant difference. Moreover, in my opinion, the accuracy is more important than the accuracy rankings.\n\t2. The authors may want to compare the state-of-the-art GNNs from the top spots on the OGB leaderboards [2] with the vanilla GCN.\n2. The authors claim that Pubmed is a small dataset and CS is a large dataset. However, the number of nodes in CS (# Nodes=18,333) is less than that in Pubmed (# Nodes=19,717) from Table A1. In my opinion, the small datasets include Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Photo, CS, and Physics.\n3. The improvement on the large datasets (ogbn-arxiv and products) is marginal. The authors may want to evaluate a statistically significant difference against the second-best result.\n4. The motivation for GNN-to-MLP distillation is unclear. In Section 4, the authors mainly focus on the transductive setting, whose metric is accuracy rather than inference time. Therefore, GNN-to-GNN distillation is more promising than GNN-to-MLP distillation in this setting, as MLP suffers from suboptimal prediction performance according to the claim in Section 1.\n\n\n[1] GNNAutoScale: Scalable and Expressive Graph Neural Networks via Historical Embeddings.
