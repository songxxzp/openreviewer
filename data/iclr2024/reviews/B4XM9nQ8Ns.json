                "value": "1. Problem setting about the stochastic system. As the author mentioned, they used an alternative definition of the stochastic dynamics, e.g random ODE. However, the reviewer is confused by the benefit of such definition compared to the deterministic setting. In result part 4.1, both the mean and the STD of the underlying system are shown. However, the STD form doesn't corresponds to any dynamics and the mean is close the the true mean of the system. In such circumstances, it seems only the mean estimation is important and the std cannot be leveraged to judge the performance of the proposed model. For part 4.2, the STD result is also confusing. It is compared with the diffusion terms but it is totally different from the true diffusion term. Therefore, the reviewer wants to ask why we need to include the STD and how it can help the proposed model. \n\n2. The result needs to compare with more SOTA models and include more comprehensive metrics. There are several model combining learning based method and SINDy-like algorithm for the equation discovery tasks [1][2]. Also, by checking the Figure 2, we could find that the discovery form is different under different $\\sigma$. For a equation discovery problem, it is important to get a consistent and correct form. Therefore the reviewer suggests adding more metrics on evaluating if the proposed model can get the correct form, e.g, precision and recall metrics.   \n              \n[1] Bayesian Spline Learning for Equation Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamics with Quantified Uncertainty. \n       \n[2] Physics-informed learning of governing equations from scarce data\n  \n3. The high dimensional 10d lorenz 96 is not compared with any baselines. Moreover, the analytical form is not listed in the main manuscript. Figure 4's caption says check equation 9 but that's for lorenz 63. Lorenz 96 should like equation 12 but with the concrete forcing terms. Equation 12 indicates that all the coefficients except the forcing terms should be close to 1 or -1. However, the discovered coefficients for $x_i$ is not close to these values. Again, the reviewer doesn't understand what is the gain of reporting the STD form of the equation here. \n\n4. The methodology part is confusing. Figures 2 says $\\theta$ has 3 terms but page 8 says $\\theta$ has 2 terms. Moreover, in the lower part of Figure 2, $z$ is firstly sampled from $p_{\\theta}(z)$ then was fed into decoder $H$. However, the definition of $\\theta$ has already included $H$, making the $H$ applied to $z$ 2 times. The term \"inference model\" is commonly used for test time, but the author use it to indicate training procedure. There are all the confusing parts need to be clarified."

                "value": "This work introduces HyperSINDy, a framework to model a family of special stochastic dynamics via a deep generative model of sparse, nonlinear governing equations whose parametric form is discovered from data.  HyperSINDy is built upon the combination of hypernetwork and SINDy and can learn a family of stochastic dynamics whose coefficients are driven by a Wiener process.\n\nThe main contributions of the HyperSINDy are summarized as follows: \n(1) This framework can efficiently and accurately model random differential equations (random ODEs), whose coefficients are parameterized by a Wiener process. Hence, it provides a generative modeling of stochastic dynamics when their random ODE forms are driven by white noises.\n\n(2) HyperSINDy can discover the analytical form of a sparse governing equation without a-priori knowledge. Also, by using the sparse masks, the computational complexity of HyperSINDy is scalable."

The second example equation (11) is not even a valid example of stochastic  Lotka-Volterra. I don't know what is N(0,1) on the Right hand side means here. \n\n3.
