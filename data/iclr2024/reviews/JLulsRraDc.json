            "questions": {
                "value": "Abstract:\n- Some claims in the Abstract are a bit vague. For example, the authors mention RaFFM shows \"significant superiority in resource utilization efficiency.\" What metrics are used to measure this superiority? How \u201csignificant\u201d are the improvements?\n- Further, the authors claim that the performance is \"on par with traditional FL methods applied to full-sized FMs.\" This statement would benefit from quantification, if possible. Is it a 1% difference in performance, or is it negligible?\n- The abstract mentions that the framework is effective \"across tasks in both natural language processing and computer vision domains.\" This is a broad claim. Please specify if there any limitations or specific conditions under which this is true.\n\nIntroduction:\n- The problem statement could be more explicit and clearer. The authors mention the challenges of integrating FMs into FL but do not clearly delve into why this integration is crucial. For example, \u201cGiven the superior strengths of FMs in few-shot transfer learning, they appear well-suited for non- IID FL environments.\u201d This sentence: a) assumes that Foundation Models have \"superior strengths\" in few-shot transfer learning without providing evidence or citations to support this claim. This is a strong statement that requires substantiation. b) The sentence implies a logical connection\u2014that because FMs are good at few-shot transfer learning, they are well-suited for non-IID FL environments. However, it does not explain why this would be the case. The logical leap is not self-evident and needs justification.\n- \u201cfine-tuning FMs typically requires approximately seven times the resources compared to inference.\u201d This is an interesting point but is presented without reference or further elaboration.\n- Consider improving the logical flow and cohesion when transitioning from the problem statement to the proposed solution.\n- While the authors discuss the technical aspects, the broader impact of this work is not adequately addressed. For example, how will RaFFM contribute to the field of FMs/FL?\n- The key contributions could be more specific (despite some descriptions in the paragraph before the bullet points). For example, what are \"specialized FM compression algorithms\"? How are they specialized, and why is this significant? Also, claims such as \"enhanced resource utilization,\" \u201csignificant reduction in communication overhead\u201d could benefit from clearer quantification and specification, if possible.\n\nBackground:\n- The discussion about FL somewhat lacks depth and may benefit from improved cohesion as it feels disjointed. For example, the authors mention \u201ca representative FL algorithm is FedAvg\u201d but do not explain why it is representative or how it works.\n- The authors mention that FL is a preferred choice in sectors like healthcare but do not elaborate on why this is the case. A sentence (or citation) or two providing context could be beneficial.\n- Phrases like \"often lead to training failures\" and \"poor model convergence and performance\" are vague. What constitutes a \"training failure\"? How poor is \"poor performance\"? Consider adding some citations to support these claims at least.\n- Similar problem to the problem statement. The authors mention that there is a gap between traditional model training and FL, particularly in heterogeneous FL-edge environments. However, the nature of this gap is not clearly articulated. Is it a technological gap, a performance gap, or something else?\n- The term \u201cresource-hungry\u201d has been mentioned several times so far but it is somewhat ambiguous. Is it computational resources, memory, or something else? Furthermore, in the context of the paper, it seems \u201cresource-hunger\u201d would be more fitting, given it has been properly explained?\n\nMethodology:\n- This section reads a bit like a mix of existing solutions and proposed solution (especially the opening part of the first subsubsection \u201cSALIENT PARAMETER PRIORITIZATION\u201d). This lack of clear demarcation can lead to confusion for the reader and dilutes the focus of the section. Consider maybe moving some of the discussion on model compression/scaling, the review of existing solutions, and how the proposed work differs or improves upon existing ones."

Third, the paper does not make it clear why it is necessary to apply a special significance prioritization strategy to the transformer.\nW2: Comparisons with relevant baseline methods are lacking in the paper. Methods that extract submodels from the original model for local training have been investigated, such as in [3].\nW3: The description of the experimental setup of the paper is not clear, for example: 1) The scenario in the paper is client computing resource heterogeneity, and the experimental part does not introduce the distribution of the sub-model size held by each client; 2) The hyper-parameter settings in the experimental part are not listed, which makes it difficult to reproduce the experiments; 3) The distribution of the data between the clients is not introduced, and there is a lack of experiments on the part of the heterogeneity of the data.\n\n[1] Li H, Kadav A, Durdanovic I, et al.

Typically we might train those on public tasks. Is FL  mostly targeting the fine-tuning part ? Overall, an expanded motivation would be great. \n\n- Maybe some discussion about privacy could be good to have. For example, how well does this method work with Differential privacy (noise), gradient clipping etc. I don't think there is a need to show these results, but maybe consider discussing these aspects. \n\n- While speedups of ~2x were shown for smaller FM (e.g, bert base), and reduced memory cost,  I was wondering if this is enough to train on resource constrained devices (e.g., mid-range mobile phones). In figure 3, memory in the order of 200GB is shown. I was wondering if this can be broken down to better show the memory requirements during training for end-devices. Maybe provide some numerical results wrt to the time it would require to compute a single round for a range of end-user devices."
