Analysis of 2D/3D masked autoencoders.\n\nIn the manuscript, the authors commented that __\"These designs make an intrinsic difference from 2D MSMs, where there is no need to recover masked pixel locations.\"__\n\nIt is true. I understand the analysis by the authors. When we think of the vanilla MAE, it also takes a masked image as an input and predicts the color information, not its pixel location. However, when we think of the nature of the point cloud, it is sparse, irregular, and unordered. Even, I would say _raw point cloud_ naturally does not involve color information. Accordingly, it is not feasible to extend the concept of the MAE for the 2D image into the MAE for the 3D points. In my opinion, the authors should have written such a clear understanding of MAE for 3D points. \n\nW-2. Details in computing surface normal and surface variance on scene-level experiments.\nWhile the various object-level datasets, such as shapenet, are synthetically created, the real-world points are captured by the sensors. Due to such difference, raw point cloud from the real world naturally involves lots of noise, which could be an issue when computing surface normal using PCA. So I wonder how the authors solve this issue when conducting experiments on Sec. 4-4 in the manuscripts.\n\nW-3. Insightful analysis\nI truly agree that the proposed experiments demonstrate that the surface normal and surface variance are important measurements for self-supervising learning using 3D points. Technically, I also agree with such an observation. However, I wonder why such an approach brings performance improvement. Is there any geometric analysis? Based on the manuscript, this approach can be viewed as a naive extension of the Point-MAE that additionally uses other geometric measurements. \n\nI want to know the author's own analysis of such problem setup and insights."

However, my main concern is not only related to this work in particular but to this line of works where they focus on tasks related to single objects. I have been playing around with these datasets for many years already, and I can say that datasets such as classification on ModelNet40, and segmentation on ShapeNet are relatively \"easy\", there is a lot of noise in the annotations, and I believe the improvements presented by current methods is simply overfitting to this specific data set. In other subfields of computer vision, a pre-training paper that is only evaluated on MNIST or CIFAR10 would not be accepted, but for some reason, they do for point clouds. So, I don't find these works convincing since the reported results and architectures usually do not translate to more challenging tasks such as semantic segmentation or instance segmentation on real 3D scans. That being said, this work presents results on the task of object detection of ScanNet and SUN-RGBD, which I believe is the right direction. However, I think more results reported on other tasks such as semantic or instance segmentation should be necessary to determine the quality of the pre-training strategy. Therefore, I will rate this paper marginally below the acceptance but I will be happy to see additional results during the rebuttal phase."
