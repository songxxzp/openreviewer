It would be better if the authors specify the data modalities with limited availability or accessibility.

It seems like a 2D matrix, so what do the rows and columns represent? From the Introduction section it seems to be two distinct biomarkers, but suppose the matrix is $ M \\times N $, what will the M and N feature dimensions represent?
