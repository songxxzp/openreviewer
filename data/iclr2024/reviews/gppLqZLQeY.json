The proposed method is overall an extension to the 1-MLE method in the OSAN, which is not a big problem to me. However, what I would expect is a more in-depth analysis of the proposed method. The authors only use a single category of graphs (CSL and its $(n, l)$ extension) to show that the proposed method is more powerful than a random policy and OSAN, which is trivial from my perspective. Instead of comparing it with random policy, a more interesting question would be: How well does the proposed method compare to the full-bag version? Can it achieve the same expressive power as the full-bag version and in how much $T$ can it be from a theoretical perspective? \n2. To distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is only the first step towards an expressive GNN. Can the model successfully encode the structure information like counting cycles play a more important role in real-world tasks. Full-bag versions of subgraph GNNs have a much better ability to encode sub-structures [1]. I am wondering can the proposed method maintain its ability to encode sub-structures.\n3. Some commonly used synthetic datasets for comparing expressive power are missing (e.g. EXP [2], CSL [3]). This could be part of the answer to weakness 1.\n4. Some commonly used synthetic datasets for evaluating the counting power of GNNs are missing [1]. This could be part of the answer to weakness 2.\n5. The main contribution of the subgraph sampling is its lower computational cost compared to the full-bag version. However, the authors only show a simple comparison of the inference time using one dataset where the full-bag version is OOM (Table 7). I believe a more comprehensive comparison between the full-bag version and the proposed method is required. What is the time and memory cost of the proposed method compared to the full-bag version in both the train and the test? How does the cost vary if we increase the $T$? \n\n[1] Huang et al., Boosting the cycle counting power of graph neural networks with i$^2$-GNNs, ICLR23.\n\n[2] Abboud et al., The surprising power of graph neural networks with random node initialization.

However, CSL graphs are just a family of regular graphs that cannot be differentiated by 1-WL.

I recommend adding time evaluation on more datasets, and reporting the time of \"policy learn\", \"random selection\", the full subgraph GNN, and MPNNs. For example, you can report the time of GIN, OSAN, FULL, RANDOM, and POLICY-LEARN on ZINC.\n\n(Wang and Zhang 2023) Wang Y, Zhang M.

The observation should be pointed out, since the definition now seems that the sequence of k_i might also lead to non-isomorphism.

The paper introduces a new subsampling strategy, _Policy-Learn_ which aims to reduce the number of subgraphs needed for subgraph GNNs. _Policy-Learn_ consists of two subgraph GNNs, one selection network $f$ and one policy network $g$: $f$ learns a distribution over the nodes of the input graph to select which subgraph to sample next, $g$ takes the sampled graphs as input and performs a prediction task. The paper motivates _Policy-Learn_ by considering the graph class of $(n,\\ell)$-CSL graphs, where one instance consists of $\\ell$ disconnected, non-isomorphic CSL graphs on $n$ nodes. For $(n, \\ell)$-CSL graphs, _Policy-Learn_ only needs to sample $\\ell$ subgraphs in comparison to random subsampling and the existing subsampling strategy OSAN.
