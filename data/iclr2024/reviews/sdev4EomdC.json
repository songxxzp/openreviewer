Experiments are done on Split-Cifar100, Mini-Imagenet100 and Core50, and using several competitve methods like ER, SCR and ICARL. They find that under a fixed memory budget, it is more efficient to store most of the memory in the long term memory rather than in the short term memory (thus, the *online setting* is more efficient)."

In that case, why are you using short term memory at all if the analysis concludes that you should not use it ? (It's also a question, please inform me if I missed something here). In the case that I am correct, I think that these analysis are not necessary to the paper.\n- 2) I think an important comparison is missing to the paper which is for me the main point. You claim that the optimal setting is using a small short-term memory but I have not seen experiments not using any short term memory (which would collapse to the GDumb baseline [1]). Indeed, if this baseline performs well under your experimental setting then the claim of the paper changes completely and the novelty is not here anymore. So I think it's very important to include this baseline that uses all the memory available (i.e 7k for cifar100) as long term memory.\n- 3) It would be nice to have results for Split-Cifar100 and Mini-Imagenet with more splits (20), since then the total allowed memory would also be smaller.\n\n[1] \"GDumb: A Simple Approach that Questions Our Progress in Continual Learning\", A Prabhu, PHS Torr, PK Dokania"

If resolved, I can list the other issues in the work.\n\n**W1.** *$C_{task}$ and $M_{online}$ have different distributional constraints* [**Critical**]\n- The fundamental discrepancy arises from the proposed memory correction. Offline continual learning employing a 2000-sized memory buffer ($M_{offline}$) is notably disadvantaged relative to online continual learning with a 7000-sized memory ($M_{online}$).\n- This stems from the fact that while the data distribution within a task ($C_{task}$) remains static, the memory ($M_{online}$) has the potential to represent samples from all past data distributions.\n- Concretely, I think the primary factor favoring online CL over offline CL in Section 3.3 comes from this imbalance in representation. 5000 samples from the latest distribution $C_t$ (in $M_{offline}$) are markedly less useful than 5000 samples across $D_1, ..., D_t$ (in $M_{online}$), hence it performs poorer. \n\nI would be very surprised if online continual learning ever outperforms the offline continual learning setting, elaborated below.\n\n*What if , with the only difference being short-term memory?*\n\nWhat is the fair correction to memory then? (I agree with the paper equalizing computation)\n- Equalize the long-term memory alongside computation. Interpolate between short-term memory from size $C_{batch}$ to $C_{task}$ \n\n- Concretely, in Section 3.3, the offline model can use a far larger short term memory (5000) compared to an online model (64). Both have the same fixed sized long term memory but have equal computation.  \n\nI claim (informally): Any training algorithm (with compute budget C) where 64 samples are sequentially introduced can be mimicked when you have access to those 64 and subsequent samples (totaling 5000 samples). The reverse is not feasible due to the inaccessibility of future samples. \n\nConclusion: Offline continual learning should be strictly better than online continual learning in principle! (Strictly better because future samples help improve performance)\n\nHowever, this diametrically opposite to the aim of this work. I hope the above informal statements conveys the core intuition behind why offline continual learning is going to be better than online alternatives.\n\n**W2** *Bound not tight, and likely vacuous* [**Critical**] \n- Theorem 1, in its current form, merely establishes an inequality without showing that the bound is tight. However, the subsequent arguments rely heavily on the bound being tight.\n- For proof of theorem 1 to be complete, one must additionally show that the same hypothesis h* achieves equality in both Eq 9 and Eq 8 in Appendix A.1. It is unclear to me that the best hypothesis on distribution of memory samples will necessarily be the best for overall data distribution. However, note that I haven't looked at Mansour et al. (2009).\n\n *Would the tightness, if shown, convince me?*\n\n- It would make the proof of the theorem complete. However, for deep learning systems, generalizations bounds likely more sophisticated than Theorem 1 are shown to be vacuous [1]. I would not hinge my entire motivation on minimizing discrepancy due to this. \n- Because of this reason, I think the theoretical motivations for the empirical results are quite poor and Section 5 adds little value to the work.\n- However, I am perfectly happy to consider predictions from Corollary 2.2 on their own terms and empirical results in Figure 3 from it.\n\n[1] Uniform convergence may be unable to explain generalization in deep learning."

However, as it stands I think there are fundamental flaws in the work due to confusing the nature of $C_{task}$ and $M_{online}$ and I am fairly confident in this claim."

                "value": "Although combining online and offline CL is interesting, using the same memory and compute for online CL as used by offline CL makes both computationally expensive. Online CL uses many more iterations at each timestep to match offline CL\u2019s compute overhead. Thus online CL becomes ill-suited for many real-world applications e.g., on-device learning where fast adaptation / speed is critical. Online CL\u2019s performance gains are mostly attributable to higher compute (more SGD updates) and memory usage.\n\nThis paper defines online CL based on batch learning i.e., learner receives a batch of new data and makes multiple iterations where each iteration combines a new batch with a sampled batch of old data from the buffer. This becomes very similar to offline CL with larger batch size. A more realistic online CL can be defined such that an online learner learns new data sample-by-sample manner (instead of batch-by-batch) using a single training iteration that combines a new sample with a batch of old data. This is much faster than the former definition and suitable for real world applications where speed matters. Another difference is the number of times each new sample is seen by the learner. Unlike the latter definition, the former one allows the model to see each new sample multiple times which is not truly a single pass (core ingredient of online CL).\n\nI am not convinced that single pass causes underfitting and online CL requires multiple iterations at each timestep. Underfitting originates from specific design choices for example training from scratch where online CL model is randomly initialized and struggles due to lack of an optimum initialization (pre-training on a subset of data). There are methods that do not exhibit underfitting. An example of such a method is REMIND [1] that performs a base initialization using a subset (10% of ImageNet). REMIND performs online continual learning in sample-by-sample manner at each timestep with one SGD step / iteration on a mini-batch consisting of one new data and several old data. REMIND achieves competitive accuracy to the offline variant.\n\nAlthough this paper presents valuable insights and observations, the proposed framework focuses mainly on how to balance memory and compute between online and offline CL. It does not propose any specific mechanisms to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, enhancing stability and plasticity and underfitting issues (when present due to design choices). It lacks sufficient scientific contributions.\n\nIt is unclear how much each online and offline CL model forgets due to absence of offline upper bound (jointly trained on all data).\n\n[1] Hayes et. al., \u201cRemind Your Neural Network to Prevent Catastrophic Forgetting\u201d, In ECCV, 2020.\n\n[2] Yasir et al., \u201cA Real-time Evaluation in Online Continual Learning: A New Hope\u201d, In CVPR 2023."

                "value": "Why do we need a unified framework combining online and offline CL from real-world application perspectives?\n\nWhat is the offline upper bound (jointly trained on all data) which shows how much online CL / offline CL model forgets?\n\nHow practical is the online CL when using the same compute and memory as offline CL? Can this online CL keep up with the speed of data stream as described in this work [2]?\n\nHow does the proposed unified framework perform when a learner receives and immediately learns a single data point at each timestep i.e., sample-by-sample manner?"
