In particular, they introduce a per-instance noise variance optimization (NVO) game, which is designed to find suitable non-identical per-instance additive Laplace noises within a dataset. The authors use two algorithms to derive strategies for achieving the NE: 1) best response dynamics (BRD).1) best response dynamics (BRD), and 2) an approximate enumeration (AE) using a genetic algorithm. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the NVO game on various statistical metrics and shows that it can achieve better statistical utility while maintaining the same level of DP as the conventional Laplace mechanism."

The problem of pDP is well motivated, considering that conventional DP often introduces substantial noise into the dataset, which can significantly diminish its statistical utility. The introduction of a game-theoretical modeling approach is indeed a novel and well-suited method for tackling this challenge, with the aim of optimizing per-instance noise.\n\n2. The paper is commendably presented and effectively communicates its core contributions. It adeptly addresses fundamental questions within this domain, namely, 1) how to ensure the preservation of statistical utility, and 2) whether this alternative modeling approach maintains a sufficiently high level of privacy protection."

It is worth noting that, in practical scenarios, an even lower value of $\\epsilon$ (i.e., $\\epsilon<1$) is often preferred. I would greatly appreciate it if the authors could either provide further justification for their choice of $\\epsilon$ or consider conducting additional experiments with smaller values of $\\epsilon$ to address this concern comprehensively.\n\n2. I am genuinely curious about the computational cost associated with this approach. The datasets used in the experiments consisted of roughly one thousand samples, and the variance set was defined as relatively small. For the best response dynamics (BRD) approach, it would be valuable if the authors could present the computational time required. Regarding the approximate enumeration (AE) approach, I have some reservations about its privacy protection level, as Theorem 4.1 can only guarantee privacy protection for a Nash Equilibrium (NE) point. However, there is a possibility that AE may fail to obtain any NE point, which raises questions about the robustness of privacy protection in this context."
