                "value": "I believe that the main contribution of the paper is the construction of MLR on SPD manifolds associated with variants of Log-Euclidean and Log-Cholesky metrics. However, as I said above, the main paper's weakness is lack of novelty in developing SPD MLR. Its key ingredient here is the reformulation of MLR from the perspective of distance to hyperplanes. This formulation has been used by Ganea et al. (2018) in the context of hyperbolic neural networks, and by Nguyen & Yang (2023) in the context of SPD neural networks. The difference between the proposed reformulation and the one in Nguyen & Yang lies in the definition of the distance from an SPD matrix to an SPD hyperplane in Equation (14). However, this definition is a direct consequence of Theorems 2.23 and 2.24 in Nguyen & Yang (2023), where it is stated that the pseudo-gyrodistance is equal to the SPD gyrodistance (which turns out to be the geodesic distance) in the case of Log-Euclidean and Log-Cholesky metrics. Thus there is no finding in Equation (14). \n\nIt is noted in Xavier Pennec et al. (2006) that the Log-Euclidean framework turns SPD manifolds into flat spaces. Thank to this property, \nextensions of classical methods in Euclidean space to SPD manifolds pose no challenges. Sereval examples are given in Xavier Pennec et al. (2006). Please see also Arsigny et al. (2005) (reference below). This is also the case of Log-Cholesky framework, where it has been shown (Lin, 2019) that the sectional curvature of SPD manifolds under this framework is constantly zero (thus SPD manifolds become flat spaces). \n\nIn summary, Equation (14) is a direct consequence of Theorems 2.23 and 2.24 in Nguyen & Yang (2023), and the Log-Euclidean and Log-Cholesky frameworks that the paper focusses on turn SPD manifolds into flat spaces and therefore allow one to straightforwardly derive extensions of MLR to SPD manifolds (Lemma 3.3 and Corollary 4.3). \n\nIn terms of experimental results, although the proposed method achieve improvements when it is used in the frameworks of some SPD neural networks, it is hard to see the real benefit of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. For instance, the method in Li et al. (2018) (reference below) achieves 84.47 $\\pm$ 1.52 on HDM05 compared to 63.06 $\\pm$ 0.76 obtained by the proposed method. The same issue applies to experimental evaluations for radar and EEG classification where more efforts are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. Also, there is no comparison against SPDNetBN which has been shown to outperform SPDNet in a variety of problems. \n\n**Questions:**\n1. Can the proposed method be used in SPDNetBN ? If yes, how about the performance of the resulting network ?\n\n**References**\n\n1. Arsigny, V., Fillard, P., Pennec, X., and Ayache, N.
