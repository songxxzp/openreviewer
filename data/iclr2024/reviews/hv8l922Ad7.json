They also show correlations of metrics to this measure of generalisation.\n\nOverall, the proposed metrics are fine, but are not ground-breaking. People used Hungarian matching before (albeit not in metrics, by choice, it comes with an effective metric see below), and using classifiers is also quite standard (although again, not in exactly the same way they do).

                "value": "1. The alignment problem is well defined, and even though I am not sure I would agree with the decision, the choice of going for strong disentanglement is well put forward.\n2. The metrics are fine (up to questions below), and I would expect them to improve on the status quo (which is not satisfactory to any practitioner, metrics are hard), although I am not sure supervised metrics is really what is missing right now."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The paper spends a lot of time presenting the problem, even though these are quite known/trivial to the community and these flaws are mostly the effect of historical drift / evolution. \n2. In my opinion, strong disentanglement is not something that is of high value to target anymore, and hence the paper is solving for something that the community has moved on from already. This will show up in subtle ways in the metrics, for example how would you expect \u201ccolor\u201d to be handled by your metrics? What about if your groundtruth labels for generative factors use RGB but the latents use something closer to HSV? Again, strong disentanglement is an odd (historical) target.\n3. The presentation and clarity could be improved. A lot of time is spent on setting up the problem and what is wrong, but very little to actually present clearly how the metrics are computed and what matters. Several captions/descriptions refer to missing content (or that is only in the Appendix), and tables use bolding in a confusing way. Overall it needs work.\n4. The compositional generalisation section makes some assumptions that are too simplistic and the provided interpretation is not taking into account some existing subtle observations from previous work.\n5. It is of limited scope, and it is not clear if this will be useful to the community at large. The correlations are only performed between their own measurements, which could have cyclical dependencies."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. How would your metric handle situations which are not compatible with strong-disentanglement?\n   1. E.g. the color example above? This happens a lot and in my experience is what makes current metrics \u201cbad\u201d, not just the alignment issue.\n2. The Hungarian algorithm usually uses L2 over whichever values you use. You chose MI, which means you\u2019re taking squared distances of bits in order to do tie-breaking or fine-grained factor-latent attribution. Is that really what you want?\n   1. This is actually a strong hidden assumption in your metric. In my experience L2 is not always what you need, and situations where multiple alternatives are equally likely do not always behave well without careful consideration.\n   2. See for example AlignNet [1] and especially OAT [2] for a more careful discussion of why learning the metric to align on might be necessary in more complex situations.\n3. The presentation of the SNC metric is not as clear as it should be.\n   1. What is z_i? I understand it\u2019s the output of the hungarian matching from G to Z, but you do not define it\n   2. The description of the binning is confusing. \n   3. What happens if you had continuous factors/latents?\n   4. How does this differ from computing the Discrete mutual information?\n4. The NK metric reliance on classifiers might be problematic:\n   1. How do you avoid issues with overfitting by using classifiers?\n   2. This is partially why DCI used linear classifiers. I am not sure the MLP results in Table 1 are encouraging.\n   3. How different is it to doing the \u201cdifference between best and next best\u201d latents that most other metric do? Your Hinton diagrams do not have a lot of mass on more than 1-2 factors per latent (as expected if the methods work), does it really matter?\n5. Table 1 is not discussed that precisely and Table 4 in the Appendix seems more interesting\n   1. Why did you bold all MLP values, instead of bolding across rows to indicate the best model? This was confusing / unhelpful.\n   2. Why do you use an MLP despite the issues you raised? How do you counteract overfitting?\n   3. The comparison of accuracies at the end of Section 5.1 just does not feel appropriate. You cannot make judgements about linearity of sum of classifier scores vs classifier score of more latents, especially given you used a nonlinear classifier? It also does not bring much.\n6. Table 2 cites a CG linear which does not exist.\n7. The compositional generalization does not feel consistent with previous work or my own experience with these models. It is both more complex and simpler than you assume.\n   1. These models will encode what data they have seen. The fact that they can extrapolate to held-out value combinations depends entirely on the support you chose to train on.\n      1. See the Appendix of Spatial Broadcast Decoder [3] for an example of this in action in a simplified setting, compare Figures 13, 14, 15 and 18.\n      2. As you can see, having no support in the \u201cmiddle\u201d of the support is not hurting the generalisation ability of the encoder. It perfectly handles unseen values.\n      3. Instead, having values held out at the \u201cedge\u201d of the distribution can result in various failures / under-optimal solutions. The latent space in Figure 15 (say FactorVAE with Spatial Broadcast) does somehow complete the missing corner, but not perfectly. So yes it is not perfect but it also is better than a random manifold?\n   2. Your usage of a MLP, especially without careful regularisation, will definitely amplify this effect. Also if you use discrete generative factors, you should not really expect meaningful rank-preserving latents to appear. As you chose size and shape, you are exactly in the regime where no linear extrapolation is likely, so all bets are off (especially on these toy datasets).\n   3. In my experience it is definitely possible for these models to extrapolate compositionally, but one has to be extremely careful about it, and they are not magical. But it is not as clear cut a \u201cno\u201d as you assert however.\n8. Some examples are contrived and less likely to happen in reality. \n   1. For example Section 3.2 proposes a XOR latent to indicate how the metric might fail. How likely is that to happen in practice?\n\nReferences\n- [1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08973\n- [2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04693 \n- [3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07017"
