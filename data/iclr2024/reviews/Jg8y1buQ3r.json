Also, the paper's contribution is well-motivated but not concretely declared as bullet points in the last part of introduction (probably due to space restrictions) which would be very helpful to several readers.\n\nThe methodology is clearly presented and the notation is suitable. I would only demand more rigor through providing the dimensionality of all symbols.\nQ1: Why perform random sampling to produce x_m? Wouldn't be the same to average the N' first vectors? Please motivate your choice.\nQ2: In rejection sampling, it is unclear why should the average memory vector be equal to the vector of highest reward. Maybe I have missed something.\nAnswer to Q1 & Q2: The randomness is necessary to obtain x_m^*. The process is done for each (I,X) pair, so after it the best memory vector is obtained.\nThese questions should be answered before the reader gets confused.\n\nToo few datasets are used for evaluation: only two while there are several meme datasets (Memotion7k, MultiOFF, Harm-C, Harm-P, etc. \n\nCan one gain any explainability with regards to the memory module? What does it actually learn? It seems like a black box that has been named memory module and untenably attributed with correlation-extracting functionality.\n\nThe related work is somehow poor. LLMs are missing and the meme literature while sufficient is described only in very high level.\n\nNo limitations of this work are provided, including for instance the compute requirements both for training and inference compared with the competing SotA methods for the task. \n\nMinor issue with respect to terminology: I suggest to use multimodal LLMs instead of plain LLMs to avoid confusion."

As there is no introduction about its optimization, I assume they are updated in each iteration by BP. Therefore, the modules suffer from limited novelty. In addition, current introduction cannot reflect why they are memories? What does the matrix memorized? The operations in Cross-modal Memorizing looks like attention mechanisms with visual and text features as inputs.\n\n2)The authors should discuss differences between self-rejection training and previous methods. Current introduction makes it looks like standard contrastive learning\u3002\n\nOther issues:\n\n1)From Fig. 1 and Fig. 4, it is insufficient to observe complementarities or contradictions between image and text. The authors should present more examples to demonstrate effectiveness.\n\n2)Fig. 2 is somewhat complicated and confusing. I suggest the authors present HMD and self-rejection training by different figures.\n\n3)The experiments can be further improved. First, the baseline performance without LLM should present in main manuscript. Second, the right column of Table 3 should be removed. The improvements seem minor. Third, from Table 5, it seems that memory module is actually co-attention mechanism. There are only ablation study for the proposed methods. The authors should present some analyse experiments, e.g., compare self-rejection training with similar methods, influences caused by different prompts."
