The paper creates the new DER-Solomon dataset by first estimating the probability distributions of the essential parameters of the Solomon dataset and then generating new problem instances by using the estimated distributions. The paper then trains a DRL model on the DER-Solomon dataset and shows comparable performance on the testing instances compared to optimization-based approaches."

The paper lacks background descriptions of the CVRP and CVRPTW problems and also probably some more detailed introductions on the existing traditional algorithm approaches. Given there is plenty of space for the paper, such background information could be very beneficial to the audience. VRP may be well-known in the community, but the variants are probably not.\n\n2. A lot of details are not presented in the paper. E.g., given the estimated distributions of the parameters, how are the new instances sampled? Are all parameters considered independently? Why generate 1280k instances? Moreover, there are no given details on how the DRL model is trained using DER-Solomon.\n\n3. The technical contribution is limited. It mainly estimates the distributions of a given small dataset to generate instances to form a larger dataset. It does not compare the proposed sampling method to some more basic methods. For example, what if we just add Gaussian noises to parameters in Solomon or use some uniform sampling to generate the instances?\n\n4. Curretly I think parameters of the dataset are assumed to be independently samples (correct me if that is wrong). Is there a reason to make such an assumption? Would it be beneficial to consider a more complex distribution of the parameters?\n\n5. The studied problem has a relative restricted scope. Could such techniques explored in the paper get applied to solving other classic optimization problems as well? Or what special properties of the Solomon dataset makes the approach most effective?\n\n\nMinor:\n1. Page 3:  \"its frequency histogram is shown in Figure 2(a)\" but there is no index of (a) or (b) in Figure 2.\n2. X-axis of Figure 5 is not labeled."
