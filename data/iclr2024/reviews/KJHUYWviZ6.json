By \"socially fair\", it means the objective is to minimize the maximum value of loss over given 'protected' groups. The authors show simple polynomial time algorithms for fair regression however they show hardness results for even constant factor approximation to the fair LRA(Low rank approximation) problem. Under certain assumptions, the authors show a $2^{poly(k)}$ algorithm for the fair LRA problem. The authors use sketching techniques and several well-known results from randomized numerical linear algebra to achieve this. The authors support their theoretical claims with a set of proof -of -concept empirical results."

The experiments complement well with the simple algorithms.\n4) The paper, for the most part, is written clearly and appears sound (only had a high-level look at the proofs).

I believe here the groups are non-overlapping. Can you comment on the results were the groups overlapping?\n4. What is the significance of the $\\Delta$ in theorems 1.1. and 1.2. Is it guaranteed that the optimal $\\mathbf{x}$ will also lie in the range given by $\\Delta$?\n\nMy score is weak accept due to some of the confusion.

For example, for fair regression, the authors may want to compare their convex solver method to Abernethy et al. (2022). \n3. The contribution to socially fair regression seems limited since the method is simple and based on the observation in Abernethy et al. (2022). \n4. This paper is not well-organized. Section 1.1 about the contributions is overwhelmingly long (about 2.5 pages), most of which is about the fair low-rank approximation which I think can be put in Section 3, especially since some parts in Section 1.1 and Section 3 are overlapped.\n\nSome typos:\n1. Page 4. 'Thus we consider the multi-response regression problem $\\min_{B^{(i)}} \\max_{i\\in[\\ell]}$ ...' I don't understand the $B^{(i)}$ since $i$ in used in the $\\max$.\n2.
