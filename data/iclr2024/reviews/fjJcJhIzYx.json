The idea is simple - use the overlap of answer with other clusters as the boost signal, assuming that highest overlap is most representative and likely to be the optimal solution. Experiments are done on HumanEval and MBPP-S datasets with 5 code models. Overall the proposed method can outperform 2 baselines published in the literature."

But the reviewer can foresee possibilities: for example, when the tasks are difficult and the model may make wrong outputs. Also, the wrong answers match with each other may not be scarce, since the programs are sampled from the same LLMs.\n\n\nW2: the method is specific to code cluster ranking. The significance of the results are not very clear without a significance test. The reviewer is not sure if it is a good idea to discuss improvement of average performance across various models.

Consequently, they propose SRank, which focuses more on the interplay among clusters. By quantifying functional overlaps between clusters, SRank provides a more refined code solution ranking strategy. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in pass@1 scores on both the Human-Eval and MBPP benchmarks compared to traditional methods."

The authors only briefly reference two previous works when depicting solution clustering and re-ranking tasks, which may confuse the readers, e.g., why not just execute the test cases of the dataset instead of going to generate new test cases? Thus, it is advised to emphasize the generation of new test cases and the need for re-ranking due to the lack of human-designed test cases, as done in CodeT.    \n\n- Figure for SRank reveals that result of test case execution will determine the final rank. However, the process for generating suitable test cases is inadequately discussed. For example, are special means employed to ensure the quality of generated test cases? How were the test cases generation prompts designed?\n\n- As mentioned, test case quality can significantly impact re-ranking results. For more complex programming problems, the quality of CodeLLM-generated solutions and test cases may decline. In such cases, SRank's performance changes merit discussion. Therefore, it is suggested the authors validate SRank's effectiveness with more challenging datasets (e.g., Apps and CodeContests).\n\n- Table 2 results indicate Cluster sizes are a more effective feature than Pass rates, which seems counterintuitive as Pass rates more closely resemble the Pass@K metric. An in-depth explanation is recommended. Furthermore, no mention is made of how the authors ordered entries based on Cluster sizes feature\u2014ascending or descending?"

If yes, does executing the test cases for the generated solution add value? Can we directly compare the test cases sampled from the model?\n- Why the evaluation is confined to Python language only? There are many multilingual benchmarks available now.\n- \"For each problem, we sample 100 solutions and 100 sequences of test cases.\" - In a real setting (say in an industry setting), is this a good assumption that 100 solutions will be sampled?
