The knowledge distillation strategy was used to allow for efficient self-supervised training of the supernet, and an unsupervised evolutionary search algorithm was designed to achieve self-supervised transformer architecture search. The paper is well written and easy to understand. The authors have conducted quite extensive experiments which show that the proposed method achieves good results in general. In particular, the searched architectures can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark dataset without using manual labels."
