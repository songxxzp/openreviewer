Overall, the paper exhibits a well-written supported by experimental evidence and a well-formulated mathematical framework. Figure 2, along with Section 4, elucidates the proposed approach and its crucial implementation details for the reader. I believe that this methodology holds significant promise for the research community, particularly in the midst of the surge of VLMs, where interpretable representations can not only serve as effective starting points or initializations, but also provide disentangled inputs for VLMs/LLMs to engage in high-level reasoning. The transfer learning experiments outlined in Table 2 provide strong evidence of the approach's utility beyond the confines of its training domain."
