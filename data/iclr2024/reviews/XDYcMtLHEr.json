From equation (1) I understand it results from the noise function if $p\\leq\\lambda$, but I fail to understand where $unk$ comes from. Is it a fixed token? If so, I cannot agree that noise is being applied to the message, also because, according to the equation, the message $m$ is not affecting any of the generated noise. Could the authors elaborate on this?\n2. It is unclear to me what $\\hat{x}$ means. In page 3, it is both stated \"where the goal is to try to identify the image $x \u00e2\\in C$ that the Speaker received, $\\hat{x}= x$\" and \"round when the Listener plays the I don't know (idk) action, \\hat{x} = \\hat{x}_{idk}\". It seems to have different meaning in each case. In the first case it seems to denote the guess of the listener and in the second it seems to define an action. Could the authors clarify?\n3. In page 6: \"where we linearly increase the noise level in the communication channel from 0 to $\\lambda$.\". From equation (1) $\\lambda$ represents a probability of wether insert noise or not. How does increasing $\\lambda$ will increase the level of noise? While it can happen, it does not seem necessarily true that it will happen.\n4. In tables 1 and 2, since LG(RL) and NLG are the same but NLG uses noise (as described in section 3.1); how is the accuracy of NLG much higher? is the existence of noise ($\\lambda\\geq 0$) beneficial for learning?\n5. Is the variation LG(RL) a contribution (as stated in section 3.1)? REINFORCE as been used before in emergent communication games [3, 4]\n6. do the authors allow the gradients to flow across agents as it happens in works such as DIAL [5], or are they fully independent?\n\nOverall, I have several concerns regarding the contribution of this work and the approaches presented that I would like the authors to comment on.\n\n[3] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.11192.pdf\n\n[4] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03980.pdf\n\n[5] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06676.pdf"
