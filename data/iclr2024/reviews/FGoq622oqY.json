BayOTIDE views multivariate time series as a combination of various low-rank temporal factors with distinct patterns. A group of Gaussian Processes with different kernels is utilized as functional priors. To enhance computational efficiency, the GPs are transformed into a state-space prior using an equivalent stochastic differential equation, enabling the development of a scalable online inference algorithm. One of the key advantages of the proposed method is its ability to perform imputation over arbitrary time points in the time series."

The methodological aspect of the paper does not introduce significant innovations.

As a common practice, scalars are typically represented using lowercase letters, vectors using bold lowercase letters, and matrices using bold uppercase letters. The notation employed in the paper is confusing. For instance, in Equation (1), F (a matrix) and L (a vector) are presented in the same format. Additionally, $\\omega(t)$ (a scalar) in Equation (1) and $\\mathbf{y}_n^d$ (a scalar) in Equation (5) are both scalars but are denoted differently.

Is the approach beneficial at all levels of missing values or do the benefits come only at a certain level?\n\n-- Only missingness at random is considered. GP-VAE paper considers the following mechanisms: random, spatial, 2 temporal and missing, not at random.  While spatial would not be relevant here I presume, a more relevant multivariate time series mechanisms of missingness can be considered. \n\n-- The approach considers trend and seasonality explicitly. I am not sure any of the compared benchmarks explicitly consider these channels of the time series. Therefore, I would at least include a standard multi-output GP framework with linear + periodic kernels or a spectral kernel (the implementation of the latter should be available in gpytorch). In particular, on the example represented in Figure 1 I would expect these standard methods to perform well. \n\n-- Results in Table 2 appear over a single run; a more extensive Monte Carlo study should be considered with corresponding standard deviations in the results."

To the best of my knowledge, the framework is new. The basic concept of the BPCA-based imputation approach has been known for decades, but the paper adds a few new elements. \n\nI vote for accepting the paper."

                "value": "- Section 3.2 does not seem to play any role. Perhaps this paper has been rejected before, and the authors just wanted to add a \"modern\"-looking section. I got it. But it looks hardly related.\n- Very poor proof-reading quality. Basic latex commands such as \\eqref, \\cite, etc. are not properly used. I know this might be re-re\u2026 submission, but PLEASE be respectful to the reviewers by meticulously proof-reading the manuscript before submission."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- How does the well-known non-identifiability with respect to the unitary transformation in the UV-factorization form (1) take effect on the result?\n- I am not clear how the almost linear trend could be separated in the result presented in Fig.1. How did the kernel expansion with the GPs produce the linear-looking trend component? What is the intuition behind it? \n- Although I support accepting this paper, I am not 100% sure about the novelty. Bayesian PCA-based imputation is well-established. I know the main novelty comes from the time-series part, but your paper was not very clear about the \"delta\" from the pre-deep learning imputation works. To defend your work, please elaborate on the novelty in light of existing works. I just want to help you --- I suspect many ICLR reviewers do not have a strong understanding of the machine learning basics such as Bayesian PCA, and hence, papers like this one tend to receive unfairly low ratings."
