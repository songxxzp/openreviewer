Figure 3 lacks legend, what does lines of different color represent?\n3. In Table 2, the ACC results (mean and std.) of 'No Post Calibration' method and 'Temp. Scaling' method are exactly the same, which is counter-intuitive and is of low probability, what is the reason.\n4. As for result in Table 3, the compared method (Vovk et al., 2005) is proposed too long ago. To be more convincing, further ablation study should be done, for example, compare with vanilla StoNet or other related works.\n5. In Table 1 and 2 of Liang et al. (2022), results of massive datasets and methods are listed, which is not discussed in this paper."

Afaik it requires rather restrictive assumptions [e.g., here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06177.pdf) even in much simpler cases such as $l_1$-regularized linear models. Maybe I overlooked that in all the assumptions in the Appendix. Would be great if authors could elloborate on this.\n- [Q2] further: how comes that it requires special techniques -- again even in the linear Lasso model -- to obtain valid inference after selection (post-selection inference) and this is not a problem in this much more complicated network?\n- [Q3] See C2"
