                "value": "This paper considers adversarial attacks against deep reinforcement learning agents which work by directly modifying the observations input to RL policies. The authors point out a flaw of previous work in this area: the observations which are produced by attacks may be very unrealistic and thus detectable by the victim, which could lead to mitigation of the attack's effects. They aim to remedy this by constraining attacks to be illusory, a set of properties they introduce which mean an attack is in some way hard to detect. Illusory attacks are defined by placing a constraint on the KL divergence between the distribution over sequences of observations seen by the victim policy when under attack and when not under attack. This is a reasonable constraint because optimal hypothesis testing can be shown to become harder as the KL is lower, i.e., it becomes less and less feasible for the victim to detect an attack. The authors devise an algorithm to generate KL-constrained attacks and show that it works well in practice, evading a state-of-the-art anomaly detector and human detection."

                "value": "My main concern with the paper is the presentation, which is very dense and at times difficult to understand. For instance, many of the equations in Section 4 are presented without much motivation or intuitive explanation. It seems at some points that the authors include additional mathematical details which are unconnected to the main message of the paper (e.g., discussing nonparameteric density estimation on line 188); it might be best to omit these and devote the room instead to making other points more clear. I have listed some specific problems with the writing below.\n\nAdditionally, I found many of the figures had only limited explanation. I don't find Figure 1 to be so clear\u2014there is a lot going on and I could only understand it completely after going through the rest of the paper. Figure 2 is presented with only high-level explanation in the paper, and it's not clear what all the arrows and lines mean. Algorithm 1 is confusing since $p(\\emptyset)$ and $p(o_\\\\text{old}, a_\\\\text{old})$ seem to be undefined and there is no caption.\n\nSpecific issues:\n * Line 132: I believe it should be $\\text{supp} \\\\: \\xi(\\cdot \\mid s) \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}(s)$.\n * The definition of additive perturbations on line 134 is a bit confusing. First, why are the perturbations themselves in the state space $\\mathcal{S}$. Shouldn't they be in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$? Second, the $\\delta$ notation for a point mass is not previously introduced.\n * Line 225: I believe \"relative entropy\" is actually another term for KL-divergence, and what is mean is \"cross entropy.\" The notation used of $H[X, Y]$ is standard for \"joint entropy,\" though! So this is quite confusing\u2014it would be best to clean up the notation.\n * In Algorithm 1, $\\hat{D}_\\text{KL}$ is not defined."
