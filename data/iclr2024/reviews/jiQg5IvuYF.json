In particular, for datasets stored on the cloud in homogeneous shards, the authors try to address the performance degradation of CorgiPile, which is an online shuffling algorithm. The authors design an extra offline shuffling procedure, which can be implemented without requiring extra storage, that diversifies the examples seen during the training. Depending on block sizes $b$, the provable speed-up relative to CorgiPile can be much larger than 1. The authors then empirically study the test accuracy accuracyon standard benchmarks of training ResNet on CIFAR100 and ImageNet, and, in addition, the test loss when training on a proprietary dataset."

The offline shuffling mixes data points across different storage blocks, hence making the distribution of data points stored in each block more similar to one another.

                "value": "W1. I think the main weakness of this paper is that its contributions are a bit incremental. The key contribution is to add an offline step to mix between different data blocks, and the analysis of the reduced block variance. After that, everything else is a straightforward application of the existing bound by CorgiPile, with the block variance term replaced with a smaller one. For this reason, I think the overall technical novelty is limited.\n\nW2. I also question if the proposed offline shuffling step is realistic. First, the with-replacement version of Algorithm 2 requires creating *new* storage blocks to store the new blocks, doubling the storage requirement. This is a serious limitation in practice, as the algorithm is more pertinent to the setting where the dataset is too large so that it has to be stored in a distributed manner. I reckon that developing an analysis for the without-replacement and in-place version of Algorithm 2 must be carried out for this algorithm to have any practical impact. Even in the case where in-place implementation can be adopted, I still question if it actually makes sense to mix between different storage blocks. This is directly against the philosophy of in-database machine learning which was the original motivation for the development of CorgiPile.\n\nW3. The \"baseline\" SGD is not clear throughout the paper, as the paper switches between random access SGD (with-replacement SGD, where index is chosen uniformly at random) and full shuffle SGD (without-replacement SGD, where index is shuffled and then accessed sequentially). Figure 1 compares the proposed algorithm against full shuffle, Section 2 describes random access SGD and Section 3.2.1 mentions it as the baseline, but experimental evaluation is done against full shuffle SGD.\n\nW4. The paper fails to cite the recent development in the analysis of shuffling SGD, and I think this is a bad omission. Over the last several years, it has been shown that for shuffling SGD variants such as Random Reshuffling (RR) and Shuffle Once (SO) converge **faster** than random access SGD [A, B, C, and more] in certain cases. For example, when component functions $f_i$ are smooth and the average $F$ is strongly convex (as assumed in this paper), both RR and SO converge at the rate of $\\tilde O(\\frac{1}{nK^2})$ when the number of epochs $K$ is large enough. One can notice that this is indeed faster than $O(\\frac{1}{T})$ rate of random access SGD, by realizing that the number of iterations $T$ satisfies $T = nK$. Given this set of results highlighting the difference between full shuffle SGD vs random access SGD, I believe the actual theoretical baseline for Corgi$^2$ should be the full shuffle variant of SGD.\n\n[A] Random Reshuffling: Simple Analysis with Vast Improvements\n\n[B] SGD with shuffling: optimal rates without component convexity and large epoch requirements\n\n[C] Tighter Lower Bounds for Shuffling SGD: Random Permutations and Beyond"
