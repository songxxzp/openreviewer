The paper found better OOD generalization with FST pre-training and prefixes than other baselines. The paper also shows positive transfer on some natural language tasks."

It is not as clear what the motivation for exploring particularly FST-related tasks is. Transformers have been shown to underperform in OOD generalization on logical inference [1,2], ListOps [2], Flip-Flop languages [3], parity tasks/sensitive tasks [4], automata tasks [5], and others [6]. It would have been good to contrast the approach with some of such works, reconcile with them, and see if the synthetic pre-training proposed here can be used. \n\n[1] The Importance of Being Recurrent for Modeling Hierarchical Structure - Tran. et al.

The need to encode FST as a sequence of prefix encoding also makes the design of FST topology limited. Overall, I feel this work might scarifies too much symbolic information obtainable from FSTs in order to fit it into the prefix encoding framework. \n\n1.Limitation of FST which has to be deterministic.\n\n2.The setup looks up state and transition from the embedding table which is not scalable.\n\n3.Positional information of transformer is used as usual, which means two identical FST with different state ordering have different representation in the transformer.
