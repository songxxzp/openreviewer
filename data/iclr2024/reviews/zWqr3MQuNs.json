I think the two case studies reported by the authors, which have taken up three pages, should be two blog posts, rather than three pages of an ICLR paper. In my opinion it is fine that the proposed method (or heuristic) is simple. But it is not fine to fill out the remaining pages with experiments which are either judgmental (the first case study) or repetitious (the second case study).\n\nPage 8, second paragraph. Authors report that their accuracy is proportional to the pretraining corpus size. They also cite a paper on memorization of NNs, and argue that outliers are memorized better.\\\nMy question is: with the same theory, can Authors justify why the outliers of a small dataset are not memorized better than the outliers of a large dataset? Because that is what they are reporting. This cannot be supported by the cited theory.\n\nMy last question (and the most important one) is that why the proposed method works? Authors have not answered this pivotal question. Why not using the occurrence probability of all the words, why not the occurrence probability of the entire sentence, why not the occurrence probability of the sentences that appear in the pretraining corpus and filtering out the rest. \"WHY\" the proposed heuristic works?\n\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = \\\nThe comment below was added after I reviewed the paper and posted the score, but before it was released to the authors.

To this end, the authors introduce a benchmark dataset -- composed of wikipedia data known to be excluded from current published LLMs -- and a method for predicting if a sample has been seen by the model during pre-training. They compare the performance of their approach with several other known approach, and demonstrate that their approach outperforms the others, on their constructed benchmark dataset. (They also compare direct-examples versus paraphrased examples, though this is in the appendix.) The authors then apply their detection method in two case studies: 1) detecting books known to be included in ChatGPT training data, and 2) detecting data pertinent to downstream tasks. Through these case studies, the authors demonstrate that model size and text length are two important factors in the feasibility of detecting pretraining samples."

Thus, I will use this section to point out the instances that are a bit unclear, or otherwise areas I think should be addressed in some form (e.g. punctuation), though I know this does not really constitute \"weaknesses\". \n\nWeaknesses: \n\n1. I presume the authors only work with English? That itself is not a weakness, of course, but it should be clearly stated. The \"weakness\" part of working with only English, is that I think lower-resourced languages may contradict the underlying hypothesis propping up the MIN-K PROB method: That is, because English is such a large percentage of training corpora for multilingual models, I'm not sure how this would work for other languages where the token probabilities given by LLMs are likely to be very low in general. How does this square with the authors' original hypothesis, and newly proposed method? \n\nMinor clarity issues: \n\n2. [S4.1] You say you use \"different lengths (32, 64, 128, 256)\", but do not specify what -- is this characters? tokens? words? S5.1 says \"words\" specifically. \n\n3. [S6.2] Similar to above: are your \"examples\" document level? Sentence level? Or what? \n\n4. [Figure 4] Your figure 4 makes it look as if 7 of the books are contaminated beyond 100%. I can tell from Table 2 that the books in the last bin (100-120) of figure 4 are at 100%, but I would either outright explain that the final bucket corresponds to 100% contamination, or change something with the visualization, because it looks a little funny :-). \n\n4. [S6.2] I find the verbiage around \"in-distribution\" and \"outlier\" contaminants to be a bit awkward. If I'm understanding you correctly, Fig5 (a) shows the contaminates that you correctly detect in the continued-pretrained model, (b) shows contaminated unrelated to the continued-pretrained model, but still included in pre-training. Is (a) the \"outlier\", simply because its not supposed to be included in pre-training data, and thus (b) is the \"in-distribution\" because this sort of data is presumed to be the type of thing we'd expect in pretraining data?  Maybe reword to \"downstream task data\" and \"control data\", or something of the like? \n\nPunctuation: \n\n5. [Appendix] Tables 5 and 6 have no bold numbers.\n\n6.

(From \"Weaknesses\" Q1) Seeing as English is going to be much more sensitive in terms of word/token probabilities, what about non-English languages, that don't constitute so much of the PLM training data. If we take mT5 as a VERY ROUGH example of the distribution of representation across languages for LLM pre-training data: English represented roughly 5% of training data -- but what about all the languages that represent only a fraction of a percent of training data (e.g. Basque, Hausa, Amharic)? Will your proposed detection method still work for these instances, where the \"signal\" that each token \n\n2. (From \"Weaknesses\" Q4) This distinction between \"in-distribution\" (August 2023 Events Wikipedia) and \"outlier\" (downstream task datasets that ought nought to be in training) got me thinking -- do you think your approach will struggle with certain domains over others? Again, if we hark back to your original assumption about unseen data having more outliers w.r.t. probability from the LLM: I would expect books and such to have much more complicated (i.e. higher PPL) samples than, say, twitter posts."
