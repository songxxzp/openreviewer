                "value": "This work aims to propose a method for stroke-level sketch editing. It addresses the challenges of decoupling strokes from sketches and accurately positioning edited strokes. The proposed approach divides the drawing sequence into individual strokes and learns stroke embeddings using a stroke encoder. Users can easily select and edit strokes at any location. The diffusion process is used to generate precise locations for the strokes based on their features. These stroke embeddings and locations are then fed into a sequence decoder to synthesize the manipulated sketch."

This is an interesting point, which is meaningful when finer control over stroke is required.\n\n- Another contribution of this work is that the authors employ a diffusion model for stroke placement, i.e., generating stroke locations based on their features. The deployment of diffusion models on stroke placement seems novel."

Perhaps the quality of the experiments could be improved by introducing editing-related tasks, such as stroke replacement/modification/interpolation, and providing analysis on how these change or improve the visual outcomes and the obtained matrics scores.\n\n- The novelty of the paper is somehow limited. The proposed method for generating sketches is mainly based on combining existing techniques. Diffusion models have been leveraged to model locations of stroke points [A, B]. The concept of generating parts/strokes and subsequently assembling them to create a sketch is not new either [C]. Please refer to the attached papers for more information.\n\n        [A] ChiroDiff: Modelling chirographic data with Diffusion Models, ICLR 2023\n        [B] SketchKnitter: Vectorized Sketch Generation with Diffusion Models, ICLR 2023\n        [C] Creative Sketch Generation, ICLR 2020\n\n- From Table 1, compared with using the original locations, the generation results with the generated stroke locations will decrease dramatically, caused by undesired stroke location shift, category changes, and messy stroke placement. Although the authors had provided some analysis on this, this could be a significant limitation of the work.\n\n- Regarding the sketch reconstruction comparison mentioned in section 4.3, the proposed method utilizes the original stroke location rather than the generated ones. It would be beneficial to evaluate the performance of using the full model in conjunction with location generation. This will help readers to understand the proposed method better."

Method is evaluated against other methods by the quality of the sketch reconstruction. The proposed approach allows combining pieces of multiple sketches together, on a stroke level."

In practice, you have almost trained an autoencoder model!.\n\nWithout using the original location (table 1), the proposed method has a REC score on par with SP-gra2seq (Table 2). The FID is lower than other methods (because you are using original locations and/or a reconstruction loss). The LPIPS using the generated locations is comparable to Sketch-RNN which is a paper from 2017!.\n\nJust having good reconstruction does not make a useful contribution.\n\n**(MAJOR ) Lack of convincing qualitative comparisons**\n\n---\n\nThe low scores would still be acceptable if the actual use-case of editing was comprehensively shown, but we are only shown a few examples in Figure 1. (where the original stroke and the edited stroke themselves aer not shown). I am not sure what the authors intend to show with the two generations - is the model unable to copy the edited stroke faithfully? or are the two generations because of two input edits? The figure and the caption do not make it clear.\n\nThe examples in Fig3 are also unconvincing - when using the locations from the diffusion model, the unedited parts change significantly!\neg the wings on the bumblebee example columns 5/6\nthe cat moves up and down considerably.\n\n**(MAJOR) Because of points 1 and points 2, the novelty is unconvincing**\n\nI would accept the paper if the results were impressive. However, they are not. This makes the paper a bit problematic to accept because the major components already exist\n\n1. GMM modeling comes from [1] and [2] with the EM algorithm also lifted from there\n2. Token based MLPs come from [3]\n\nThe major contribution would be the token mixture block but that is not presented or ablated in great detail. The mixture block is what gives the model permutation invaraince which is needed for handling sketches composed of strokes. The sequence composition is itself not detailed - do you permute the sequence of strokes or is the model itself permutation invarianct becuase of the MLP, and the encoding CNN being applied independently.\n\n**(MINOR) Grammar not being in the continuous tense**\n\n---\n\nA lot of the text is titiled something like \"Pre-train the stroke encoder...\" and \"Train the diffusion model\" instead of \"Pre-training the stroke encoder...\" and \"Training the diffusion model\".\n\n\n[1]: Sicong Zang, Shikui Tu, and Lei Xu.
