(2022) and the density-ratio-estimation perspective of Concrete Score Matching (Meng et al. 2022). The authors claim that their new objective has a number of advantages over previously-considered losses, and present a number of variants of the objective for computationally-efficient training ~~(although I don't think their justifications are sound, see weakness [W1])~~. They also discuss some alternative forms of sampling algorithms for fast decoding (similar to Campbell et al. (2022)) and discuss how to apply their technique to infilling tasks.\n\nExperimentally, the authors train non-autoregressive generative models using their objective on the OpenWebText dataset, using the GPT-2-small and GPT-2-medium architectures. They present preliminary results of partially-trained models, and show that their model's perplexity bounds are within around 15% of the perplexity of the standard autoregressive GPT-2-small. *Edit: In the current revision they also have compute-matched comparisons to GPT-2-medium, and comparisons to a number of discrete diffusion baselines, with strong results for both.*  They also assess sample quality by computing the GPT-2-large perplexity of generated samples, and find that their samples outperform vanilla autoregressive sampling for a fixed number of network evaluations (or that they match autoregressive modeling with 16x fewer network evaluations)."

                "value": "~~**[W1]**~~ *(addressed in current revision)* The central theoretical claims of this work are incomplete and unsupported, and I am not convinced they are correct. In particular, although much of the paper is devoted to statements about the new \"score entropy\" and its properties, the proofs are either omitted, incorrect, or only provided in a sketch form.\n\n- Proposition 3.2, which states that their score entropy loss has the right minimum, is never proven.\n- Proposition 3.3 and Theorem 3.4, which give alternative forms of the score entropy, have \"proofs\" that are very handwavey and informal. And I believe these proofs are also incorrect! The derivations ignore the weights $w_{xy}$ and thus end up proving something different than the intended proposition/theorem.\n- The central result, Theorem 3.6, is justified only with a sketch which says to apply the (likely incorrect) trick from the \"proof\" of 3.3 to some unstated result of Campbell et al. (2022). This is nowhere near enough detail to reconstruct an adequate proof.\n- Theorem 4.2's proof is also a sketch which does not include enough detail for me to verify its correctness.\n\nAdditionally, although the introduction claims that one contribution of the work is a \"Langevin corrector framework\", this never appears in the paper.\n\n*Edit: The authors have corrected some small errors in their theorems and added detailed proofs for all of them. I believe the theoretical claims are justified now, although I'm not familiar enough with stochastic processes to check everything in detail.*\n\n---\n\n**[W2]** The provided experiments appear to be only preliminary results. For their SEDD-small model, they \"emphasize that it is still improving\", and for their SEDD-medium model, they state that it \"has not started converging\". The authors say they will \"update our model results as training progresses\".\n\nMy understanding is that work submitted to ICLR is supposed to be feature-complete at the time of submission. I'm not sure it's appropriate to plan on updating the central results of the submission during the review process.\n\n*Edit: The authors have explained their reasoning below (they meant to pre-emptively reassure reviewers that they could add more comparisons if asked, not to do so unasked). It still seems a bit strange to include comments directed at the reviewers in a paper submission, especially with results that the paper calls \"preliminary\", since presumably these would always be removed in the final version. On the other hand, if these statements had simply not been added in the first place, I think the initial results would have still supported the main empirical claims, so perhaps this isn't a big deal.*\n\n---\n\n~~**[W3]**~~ *(addressed in current revision)* I found the evaluation criteria to be somewhat imprecise, especially in regards to the authors claims that the demonstrate \"for the first time, a non-autoregressive modeling technique that is able to achieve similar perplexity scores as autoregressive modeling\".\n\nThe authors claim performance is \"competitive\" with GPT-2-small, but this seems like a subjective statement; the perplexity of their SEDD-small models seems to be a few points higher for everything except the PTB dataset. They also present results for SEDD-medium, a larger model, which outperform the smaller GPT-2 model. However, it's not clear that comparing perplexity across model sizes is fair without controlling for the amount of training compute.\n\nThe authors additionally reference the Plaid 1B model from Gulrajani & Hashimoto (2023), which had previously shown strong non-autoregressive performance relative to GPT-2-small (albeit with a larger model and more training compute than GPT-2-medium). That seems to contradict the claim that this work is the \"first time\" non-autoregressive modeling has been competitive with autoregressive modeling.\n\nI would have hoped for a more rigorous set of experimental results here. For instance, Gulrajani & Hashimoto (2023) give a thorough study of different model scaling law behavior while controlling for training compute; this kind of thing seems necessary to fairly compare with autoregressive methods. (Perhaps much of the performance of the SEDD models here is due to them being overtrained relative to the GPT-2 models.)\n\n*Edit: The authors have added context for their 10% perplexity gap based on existing continuous diffusion results, added comparisions between their medium model and GPT-2 medium, and clarified that their experimental results are not overtrained with respect to GPT-2. The new baselines also provide additional supporting evidence.*\n\n---\n\n~~**[W4]**~~ *(addressed in current revision)* Although motivated as a way to improve upon previously-proposed discrete diffusion approaches, the experiments do not include any discrete diffusion model baselines. Additionally, the perplexity experiments use different evaluation splits and different evaluation methods from previous works, so the numbers cannot be directly compared to previous works. The GPT-2-small comparisons may also be confounded by differences in the dataset or number of training iterations used for GPT-2-small.\n\nIt is thus difficult to tell how much of the observed gains are due to the new contributions in this work, rather than being due to the training procedure, base model architecture, or evaluation method.\n\n*Edit: Diffusion baselines have been added, using consistent training, architecture, and evaluation setups.*\n\n---\n\n~~**[W5]**~~ *(addressed in current revision)* The generated samples still seem somewhat incoherent in a qualitative sense. In particular, I found the \"infilling\" samples in Table 2 to be unimpressive; none of them appear to be meaningful or consistent with the provided prompt tokens.\n\n*Edit: The newer SEDD-medium samples and long-form samples are much more coherent than those in the initial submission.*"

The key original contribution of this paper is a training criterion that is non-negative and reflexive, as MSE would be, but that also imposes a constraint requiring the network output to be non-negative.  Essentially, rather than being symmetric about the optimum in score space, the new criterion is symmetric about the optimum in log score space.  The authors argue that the new criterion is theoretically better justified.  Two simplified versions of the proposed criterion are proposed, and from one of them, a score-matching training update is proposed.  The general diffusion Markov transition matrix is argued to be too memory-expensive for practical use, so simplified transition matrices are proposed, one which tends toward a uniform distribution, one which tends to place all the probability mass into the mask label.  Using these simplifications of the proposed criterion, the authors train and demonstrate diffusion-based text generation that is comparable to GPT-2."

I am almost able to derive Eq. (9) by making the assumption that it is a Bregman divergence between s(x,y) and p(y)/p(x), using -log as the convex function, which would totally make sense, because it would guarantee that your score divergence is non-negative, reflexive, and convex in s(x,y); these properties are stated in the paper, but are not proven in the paper, perhaps because they follow naturally from the Bregman divergence.  However, if I derive it in that way, I find one typo in the equation: by that derivation, the last term should not be  (p(y)/p(x))\\log(p(y)/p(x)-1), it should be (p(y)/p(x))(log(p(y)/p(x))-1).  Indeed, my correction seems necessary, because log(p(y)/p(x)-1) will often be taking the logarithm of a negative number, which would be avoided if you instead calculated log(p(y)/p(x))-1.  Notably, this last term in Eq. (9) is ignored for most of the rest of the paper, since it does not involve s_\\theta(x); it seems to be necessary only for the purpose of shifting the criterion upward so that it is strictly non-negative."

The model is still being trained, and the authors claim that it has not converged yet; the experiment on the 1 billion-word dataset is said to have encountered unexpected errors, without elaboration.\n* Certain design choices lack justification. The SEDD model uses rotary embeddings instead of learned positional embeddings, as in the GPT-2 baseline.

Although they may have a similar number of network evaluations (as in Fig. 2), AR models can leverage techniques like KV-caching, which probably makes them significantly faster than diffusion models.\n* What does z denote in Eq.

Section 4 is not well presented. Why the design of this denoising scheme is needed? If it is designed for speedup, you need to explain two things: (1) no detailed experiments or ablation study about this strategy (2) some discrete diffusion models can sampling within several steps (like~10), and in such condition, discrete diffusion models already have the advantages over generation speed, so what's the difference between theirs and yours?\n- Writing: cictation format (citep and citet) is mixed up."

It seems that it does not refer to sampling iterations. GPT-2 is also in this Figure, what is the number of network evaluations or sampling iterations of GPT-2?\n3. It seems that you use $Q_t(i,j)$ (Eq.14) to replace the $w_{xy}$ in Eq.11. However, due to memory limitation, you choose standard matrices Q_uniform and Q_mask, where the value in these matrices is either 0 or 1. Can we assume that the Eq.14 is degenerated and we actually do not have the soft weighted denoising score entropy?"
