They begin by introducing an intuition that features contributing to misclassified samples (both ID and OOD) are more susceptible to perturbations. Building upon this insight, the authors propose a method called MixDiff, which involves mixing target and ID samples (oracle samples) with auxiliary samples to perturb both types of samples. By comparing the model outputs of the perturbed target samples with those of the oracle samples, the authors determine whether the target samples are OOD data. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in achieving OOD detection while solely relying on the model output.\n\n- In summary, leveraging the observation that contributing features in misclassified samples exhibit higher sensitivity to perturbations, the authors present MixDiff, a perturbation-based approach for OOD data detection. The method combines mixed samples and model output comparisons to effectively identify OOD data, as validated through experiments on various datasets."

However, this intuition lacks proper support and validation. Hence, it would be beneficial for the authors to incorporate relevant verification experiments to provide further evidence and clarify this aspect.\n\n- The description of the algorithm section could be improved to enhance its intuitiveness. It would be helpful to include a schematic diagram illustrating the algorithm, providing readers with a clearer understanding of its workflow.\n- In the related work section, the authors mention that some methods are not suitable for black-box APIs, where only access to inputs and outputs is available. An example of such a method mentioned in the paper is:\n\"Decoupling maxlogit for out-of-distribution detection.\" In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3388\u20133397, June 2023.\n- However, including a comparison with such methods would help readers understand the extent to which the proposed approach differs from ideal scenarios with more information, under the constraints of rigorous black-box conditions.
