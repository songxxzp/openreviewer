                "value": "This paper explores the sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) to prompt formatting choices and investigates the impact of prompt design on LLM performance in few-shot (especially few-shot classification) settings. The authors find that even subtle changes in prompt formatting can have a significant effect on model behavior, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points. This sensitivity remains even when the model size or the number of few-shot examples is increased. \nThe authors argue that evaluating LLMs with a single prompt format is inadequate and propose reporting a range of performance across plausible formats. \nThey also demonstrate that format performance weakly correlates between models, questioning the validity of comparing models using a fixed prompt format. To facilitate systematic analysis, the authors introduce an algorithm called FORMATSPREAD, which quickly evaluates a sampled set of prompt formats for a given task. The paper emphasizes the importance of reporting and considering prompt format variations when comparing models and highlights the impact of formatting choices on model behavior by extensive experiments."

The paper primarily substantiates its core claim that \"Performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to prompt formatting choices, particularly in few-shot settings,\" through experiments in classification tasks. However, the scope of the experiments does not extend to the frequently utilized capability of LLMs for long text generation. While short text generation tasks (such as identifying the second letter of a word, adding numbers, or responding with a synonym) are discussed in the appendix, these do not fully capture the important aspect of long text generation. Hence, I suggest that the authors either explicitly state that these findings are specifically under the context of classification tasks or conduct additional experiments on long-text generation to avoid any potential overclaim or misleading interpretation.\n\n2. For Figure 2, I recommend that the authors include the Pearson correlation coefficient directly on the figure for a more comprehensive representation of the data.\n\nOverall, I believe this paper studies an important question. If the authors can address my concerns, I would consider increasing my score."

In the experimental section, the authors explain that classification tasks were selected for their ease of automatic evaluation. I am curious about the challenges associated with measuring performance for text generation tasks, especially considering the benchmarks that have been proposed recently."

The sensitivity remains critical even after increasing model size, usage of in-context learning, and instruction-tuning. Given this situation, authors suggest evaluating the performance of LLMs with various prompt formatting, not with a single prompt format. The authors also report that format performance across LLMs has a low correlation, which supports the multi-prompt format evaluation of LLMs. To facilitate the multi-prompt format, the authors propose an analysis method, FORMATSPREAD, that evaluates a set of plausible prompt formats for a given task. The proposed method induces the concept of semantically equivalent formats and measures the performance gap among LLMs queried with the different formats but in a semantically equivalent set, procured by the help of Bayesian Optimization."
