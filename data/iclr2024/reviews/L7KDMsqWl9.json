Moreover, it would be interesting to see how the models presented in the experiment section would perform on these other datasets, or to include the models used in these other papers in the baseline, as they might address the challenges of Ethiopic script. (for example, Abdurhaman et al. report a CER of less than 2% on their dataset)\nIn a paper proposing a new dataset, I would expect more statistical analysis or the proposal of a method to address the specific challenges of the new dataset. In particular, the human error rate seems quite high, which at the same time makes the dataset interesting but begs the question of the quality of the ground-truth. How would the human performance be with access to reference material? Do the annotator make the same errors or different ones? Do the model make the same mistakes as the human evaluation? For the training set labeling, is there a measure of, for example, inter-annotator agreement?\nThe paper is interesting and the proposal of a new dataset valuable, but it could be more suited to other venues like DAS, ICFHR, ICDAR or maybe ICML"
