Thus, it could be unnecessary to make this approach general for everyone.\n    3. I would expect some deeper insights besides the engineering efforts made in this work. For example, how does the sequential fine-tuning change the behavior of the models? Answering some scientific questions like this would give the readers more insights for future research. \n2. Insufficient and unclear experiments.\n    1. Reranking: why K is 8? I think there should be more experiments to explain.\n    2. One more dataset would be even more convincing. \n3. Writing needs to be improved\n     1. For example, in Section 3.2, we are following Cobbe et al., (2021) to perform re-ranking. When you have the pair loss in (7-9), it is obvious that we don't explicitly have the correct and incorrect pairs. The number sampled from the model could be unbalanced, how do you handle this problem. And, do you still use the gold annotations in this reranking?"
