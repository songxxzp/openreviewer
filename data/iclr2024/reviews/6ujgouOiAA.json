                "value": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on many tasks, mainly due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. However, their performance depends heavily on the instructions/prompts given to them. Manually designing good instructions is human-intensive and costly. Thus, developing methods to automatically optimize instructions for LLMs is important. Recent works propose gradient-free methods for prompt tuning. Concretely, Chen et al. propose InstructZero which uses Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes to find optimal soft-prompts that can be used to generate optimal prompts.\nSoft prompts are vectors fed to an open-source LLM, which can generate a human-readable and task-relevant instruction given a few exemplars of the target task. The instruction is then submitted to the black-box LLM for evaluation on the target task, whose performance is used to guide the optimization of the soft prompt toward generating better instructions.\nHowever, GPs struggle to model complex high-dimensional functions like the LLM score function.This work proposes INSTINCT, which replaces the Gaussian process with a natural bandit (Neural Upper Confidence Bound - NeuralUCB (Zhou et al., 2020)) based on a pre-trained LLM to improve modeling capability. This allows efficient exploration vs exploitation for optimizing black-box LLM instructions. Experiments show INSTINCT consistently outperforms existing methods on instruction optimization tasks for the black-box model ChatGPT."

Authors tackle an important problem in leveraging large language models - automatically optimizing instructions/prompts to get better performance from LLMs. Manual prompt design is costly. They clearly identify limitations of prior work on prompt tuning that relies on GPs as such models struggle to find the optimum in high dimensional spaces such as prompt tuning.\n2. Authors improve the previous results of InstructZero (INSTINCT) and replace the Gaussian process with a neural bandit model based on pre-trained LLM embeddings, improving modeling capability for the LLM score function. Neural bandits based on pre-trained embeddings are sample efficient due to the power of pre-trained models used for embeddings. \n3. The paper is well written and easy to follow, most notably authors clearly explain the prior work and outline their contributions. They highlight the limitations of prior work, the proposed method, and present convincing experimental results.\n4. Authors  evaluate their method on instruction optimization tasks for ChatGPT, compare it to prior state-of-the-art methods, and show consistent improvements. They run ablation studies to explore the strength of using pre-trained LLM-based representations of the prompts which they show offers good similarity measure for prompts."

It is unclear how this affects automated tuning of Prompts. I would love to see how:  increasing the dimensionality D of the soft prompt affects the accuracy of the downstream accuracy of the black-box LLM with the best prompt chosen based on D. This should be repeated for both normal GP based BO and the NN-bandits based BO to see how the curves change.\n\n2. Authors improve on InstructZero by exploring different surrogate models in the BO scheme introduced by the original authors. Neural Network based bandits are shown to be an efficient mechanism but it is unclear whether a different surrogate function would not offer larger improvements. Similarly, more discussion about acquisition functions would be important. Overall, Authors choose one BO strategy, different than InstructZero and it is unclear whether it is better than any other, modern BO strategy, perhaps BORE [https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/tiao21a.html] TPE [https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2011/file/86e8f7ab32cfd12577bc2619bc635690-Paper.pdf] or evolutionary algorithms such as REA [https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01548]. \n\n3.The authors explore the BO approach for prompt tuning but neglect the recent line of work of evolutionary methods for generating better prompts, for example PROMPTBREEDER [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16797.pdf]. I believe it would be helpful to see how this strategy fares against others. I understand the paper I have references only came out recently but nevertheless more extensive evaluation is needed.\n\n4.The empirical evaluation is limited to optimizing instructions for a single black-box LLM (ChatGPT) and a single white-box LLM (Vicuna). Testing on more LLMs would strengthen the results."
