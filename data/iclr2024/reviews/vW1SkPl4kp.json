The presentation can be further enhanced in terms of clarity and logic:\n\n   - In the first paragraph on page 2, the paper introduces two proposed algorithms but fails to sufficiently detail how these tools embody and implement the ICVaR concept. This lack of substance makes the uniqueness and contribution of your algorithms unclear.\n\n   - The main argument presented in the second paragraph on page 2 is confusing. It's unclear whether the intention is to highlight the importance of integrating human feedback, with LLM as a successful example of this, or to underline the significance of risk-sensitive RL, with ChatGPT as an example. Additionally, why is \" LLMs operate in diverse conversational landscapes, where defining reward signals unequivocally is challenging\" relevant here?\n\n   - The third paragraph on page 2 attempts to give an outline of the key challenges in theoretical analysis for ICVaR algorithms with function approximation and human feedback. However, critical concepts and symbols which outline these challenges are not adequately defined or explained, which hinders the comprehension of arguments. For instance, without further context or clarification, the term \"key elliptical potential lemma\" remains obscure to readers. Moreover, the majority of the \"challenges\" outlined are essentially highlighting that current proof techniques and results cannot be seamlessly applied to your problem setting. However, there's a lack of explanation rooted in the problem's inherent characteristics.\n\n2. Limited discussion on the intuition and implications of their theoretical bounds, making it difficult to understand the relevance and significance of these results.\n\n3. Absence of algorithm implementation or experimental results limits the understanding of the theoretical results' real world impact and applicability. Practical validation through experimentation is essential to underline the significance and verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, which has been neglected in this paper."
