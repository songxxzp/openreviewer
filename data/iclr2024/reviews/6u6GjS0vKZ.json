While results from table 1 show significant improvement, they are arguable. For instance in this paper ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00476v1.pdf ), there are reports, using the same architectures,  of significantly better results. Given that baseline better results are achievable with known techniques, the improvement is shadowed by the probability that the overall technique used in training CNN is flawed and the proposed idea recover only some of the flaws. \n \nWhile I might miss a point and there can be a major difference between this paper and the reference mentioned, thus they are not comparable, this paper must refer to outside sources while establishing baselines. The databases are standard and so are the architectures, therefore other papers should have reported the accuracy for some, if not all the cases.\n\n2. Presentation - is not clear and I have problems understanding the method. A critical aspect is that the proposed loss is not explained clearly. :\n - Page 8 \"We thus propose a novel loss function leveraging activation hue, that may be used as a training signal in the (x, y) image plane of arbitrary CNN layers, most notably bottleneck layers with minimal spatial extent\".

                "value": "This paper introduces an activation method inspired by concepts found in metric learning, contrastive learning, and image retrieval. Instead of using a straightforward activation function, the proposed approach relies on measuring similarity to the nearest image's activation. The paper further supports this method with four key observations.\nHowever, I have some concerns as follows:\n\n1)\tThe proposed method relies on the assumption that target objects consistently occupy the center of activated feature maps. This assumption may be overly restrictive and should be thoroughly validated. If this assumption holds true, it suggests that using center-cropping techniques could potentially enhance network performance.\n\n2)\tFurthermore, the method also assumes that all objects are small enough to fit within a limited area at the center of the image. It's important to note that these two assumptions may not always hold in real-world scenarios, and there are many cases where objects are not confined to the center or are not small enough to fit within this region. These assumptions might not be universally applicable.\n3)\tRemarkably, the paper includes only one experiment demonstrating the benefits of the proposed method. However, to provide a more comprehensive understanding and build a convincing case for its adoption, it is essential to include in-depth analyses alongside the reported benefits.\n\n4)\tAdditionally, the paper primarily focuses on comparisons in few-shot learning scenarios, even though the proposed method isn\u2019t designed for the specific cases. To ensure fair and comprehensive comparisons, it is advisable to evaluate the proposed method against a na\u00efve activation function using the full dataset, not limited to few-shot learning scenarios.\n\n5)\tThe paper appears to lack sufficient comparisons with prior works, and it seems that the authors may have faced challenges in categorizing the proposed method and identifying relevant prior research. It would enhance the paper's contribution to the field if it included a more extensive comparative analysis with existing methods, even if the proposed approach doesn't neatly fit into existing categories. This would provide a clearer context for evaluating its novelty and effectiveness."

This activation hue generalizes the concept of the color hue angle in the standard 3-channel RGB intensity space to an N-channel activation space. Based on observations from nearest neighbor indexing of activation vectors with pre-trained networks, the authors suggest that class-informative activations are concentrated about an angle \u03b8 in both the (x,y) image plane and in multi-channel activation space.
