                "value": "The paper studies the low rank matrix completion problem using alternating minimization. Existing algorithms based on alternating minimization for this problem (Jain, Netrapalli and Sanghavi) takes time $\\tilde{O}(|\\Omega|k^2)$ time where $\\Omega$ is the set of entries samples (nearly linear in $n$ for an $m \\times n$ incoherent matrix $M$) and $k$ is the target rank $(k<<m,n)$. The main computational bottleneck in alternating minimization comes from solving two multiple response regressions per iteration (once for U and once for V). The algorithm presented in this paper proposes solving the regression problems approximately using off-the shelf sketching based solvers which take nearly linear time in input size per iteration and thus, the time for solving each regression problem reduces to $\\tilde{O}(|\\Omega|k)$ (with extra $\\log(1/\\epsilon)$ steps for convergence). However, this complicates the analysis of the algorithm as the solution at every iteration cannot be written exactly in factorized form (so the previous analysis doesn't carry through). This runtime is equal to verification time for the solution upto polylog factors. To analyze this, an inductive argument is presented which shows that at every step, the approximate solution for $U$ or $V$ is close to the optimal solution $U^*$ and $V^*$. Moreover, it is shown that the incoherence of the exact solutions to the regression problem is preserved. Finally, to show that the incoherence of the approximate solution is also preserved, some matrix perturbation bounds are developed which show that as long as any two matrices are very close in spectral norm and one matrix is incoherent, the other matrix will also be incoherent. The sample complexity for the proposed algorithm is the same as that of the old algorithm."

Moreover, the proposed algorithm is practical and easy to implement as different off-the-shelf sketching based solvers can be used for this regression step. Also, the sample complexity remains the same as previous algorithms.\n\n2) Some interesting technical result are developed for the theoretical analysis of the algorithm. Specifically, some matrix perturbation bounds are proven which show that if a matrix with incoherent rows and columns is close in spectral norm to another matrix, that matrix will also be incoherent with the incoherence factor depending on the condition number of the first matrix. This seems to be an interesting result which could be of independent interest (though I have some questions related to the proof, please see the questions section).\n\nRemark: I haven't checked all the proofs in the appendix closely (especially the proofs related to induction in Section E and F of the appendix)."
