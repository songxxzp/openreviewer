Specifically, the authors commence by elucidating the shortcomings inherent in constructing bridges within the feature space represented by bridge network, and subsequently propose their diffusion bridge as a solution to generalize from a single network output to an ensemble output. In order to empirically substantiate the efficacy of their method, a variety of experiments are executed across the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets, utilizing ResNet-$32\\times2$, ResNet-$32\\times4$, and ResNet-$34$ as backbone architectures. Overall, the paper offers an intuitive approach to the problem at hand, and I will delineate its strengths and weaknesses in the subsequent sections."

                "value": "1. **Other Transport Models** To the best of my understanding, related works such as \"Rectified Flow\" [1] and \"Flow Matching\" [2] are capable of accomplishing similar functionalities. Additionally, when compared to the Schr\u00f6dinger bridge approach, these models operate through a deterministic process, which could potentially benefit from lower variance properties. The omission of such deterministic flow models from the discussion may limit the generalizability and applicability of the method proposed in the current manuscript.\n\n0. **Inference Algorithm** In the manuscript, it appears that the authors have not provided details regarding the inference algorithm for the proposed DBN during the model inference stage. This omission leaves a critical gap in the paper, as understanding the inference mechanism is essential for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.\n\n2. **Annealing of Temperature** In Section 3.2, the authors discuss the concept of temperature distribution, yet the experimental section lacks elaboration on how the temperature distribution is selected and what principles govern temperature annealing. This absence of information creates a gap in the methodological clarity and poses questions regarding the thoroughness of the experimental design. Furthermore, from a scholarly perspective, treating the distribution as a Gumbel-Softmax distribution [3] could raise additional questions. Specifically, one might inquire whether the training variance of the Diffusion Bridge Networks (DBN) is influenced by the temperature parameter. Addressing such intricate relationships between the temperature and training variance would enhance the paper's academic rigor and contextual relevance.\n\n3. **LaTeX Compile** In Section 4.1, line 3, the manuscript contains two instances of \"??\", which clearly indicate placeholders or unresolved references. The authors should rectify this issue to enhance the document's professionalism and completeness prior to submitting the finalized manuscript.

                "value": "**Writing** This article's writing is very hard to follow. There are many spelling or grammar mistakes (see Questions). Ideas are presented poorly or too quickly, leaving the reader confused. The theory, which originates from Liu et al. 2023 is presented very quickly and unclearly, with some mistakes. ($f'$?, no definitions of $W_t$, $\\bar W_t$, $\\beta_t$, no dimensions, Schr\u00f6dinger systems are not presented, it's never clarified that $f=0$, although $f$ was never even defined. It's not clear how equation (8) is obtained.\n\n**Training** Many important points are missing, in particular, the architecture of the score network is never given anywhere in the article. Contrary to what the authors claim, the appendix does not give any hyperparameter settings: the training details of both the ensemble networks and the DBN are left unclear (Optimizer, scheduler, number of epochs/steps, distillation schedule...) This is not a detail, in particular for the DBN. If its training is particularly expensive/slow, it is an important drawback despite the speedup it provides during inference. Are Bridge Networks also using distillation, and is their training comparable to DBN? Without this information, it is hard to compare the results obtained.\n\n**Number of ensembles** I find unclear the number of ensembles that a score network is trained on. Section 4 indicates that a score network is trained on 3 ensembles, with no clarification on why this number is chosen (presumably Section 4.3). Why also not simply increase the size of the DBN network? For more than 3 ensembles, 2 or more DBNs are trained. In this case, are the DBN trained on all of the ensembles at the same time? Are they limited to a given subset of 3 ensembles, as indicated previously? \nThis becomes even more confusing in Section 4.2, where the number of ensembles increases to 9, and the number of DBNs is left unclear (\"two or more\"), as well as for BNs. \n\nDespite promising results, this article needs a serious rewrite before I can accept it for now."

In algorithm 1: is a single temperature value drawn for each member, for all data points in the minibatch?\n4. Does performance increase with multiple diffusion steps?\n4a. What's the \"cost\" of each diffusion step in term of % of DE inference speed. Can DBN admit more than diffusion step at inference and still be faster than DE?  \n5. Can the authors comment on the calibration error increase with this method?"

                "value": "The paper proposes to use Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge (DSB) as a way of bridging two arbitrary distributions, namely that of the output activations space of deep models, thereby achieving more efficient ensemble. In contrast to the previous Bridge Network approaches, the DSB approach imposes no (direct) restriction on the low-loss subspace of the parameter manifold, but instead learn a diffusion that solves the SB problem to diffuse from any ensemble member to the \"target\" ensemble model. The authors claim that the empirical results demonstrate superior performance and FLOPs requirement of the Diffusion Bridge Network (DBN)."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The introduction of temperature does define a distribution, but essentially at a cost of compromising the performance of the original ensemble member (for example, if you look at the NLL loss of the logits after applying temperature, it will be worse). Is this really a reasonable design? If you look for bridging on logit space with another, wouldn't it make more sense to consider the logit space as is (e.g., get a distribution via input perturbation, etc.)?\n\n2. Why DSB rather than a conditional diffusion from Gaussian? In $\\textsf{I}^2\\textsf{SB}$ the motivation was clearer as they hoped to leverage the structural prior of the image. Empirically, how big would the difference be?\n\n3. The paper has a bunch of analysis on the ensemble approach, but little (almost none) on the diffusion portion. For example, how much training (data and speed) is needed for the DSB training? Why diffusion instead of some simpler approaches like normalizing flows, and bringing all ensemble members to a (same) tractable distribution?\n\n\n--------------\n\nPost-rebuttal edit: I'm raising my score slightly from 3 to 5, in light of the amendments the authors make during the rebuttal. However, I still believe this paper is not completely ready for publication at the venue. See comment below for details. \n\n4. About the baseline: the Bridge Network paper seems to have better numbers on TinyImageNet than what the authors reported in this paper (e.g., 65.82% accuracy for 3-BN-sm and the FLOPs seems to be much smaller (1.15x). The BN paper also evaluated on ImageNet, where in my experience the accuracy is **much less volatile**. If, as authors claim that the BN approach has more training cost (at the end of Sec. 2.1), perhaps the DSB approach should be compared with BN on that turf as well."
