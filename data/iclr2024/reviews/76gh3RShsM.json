For example, though the abstract provides many words, it gives limited information regarding the method or contribution.\n\n2. It will be better to give further elaboration on the method section. For example, in equitation 1, the definitions of y, and \\pi are missing, as well as how the concatenation is performed. Meanwhile, I kindly ask for a detailed explanation of the term `policy-guided`. \nSimilarly, in the paragraph `Positive Unlabled Contrastive Learning.` (there is a typo `Unlabled` in the title as well), a detailed explanation is highly appreciated considering this section should cover the main technical contribution of this paper. There are other terms whose definitions are not clearly presented: `over-redundancy` in the abstract, `local optimum` in Fig.1 and introduction, and so on.\n\n3.  In section 4, the paper says\n> Note that T presents the information related to the rewards of RL, which is orthogonal to the discriminative visual semantic information, denoted as V\n\nThis is a strong claim that requires firm evidence (which can not be found in the paper). A detailed explanation of the rest of section 4 is highly appreciated.\n\n4. Regarding the experiment settings: for sample-efficient RL, 2M training steps for Atari and 1M for DMControl are quite larger than a typical setting which is 100k. The number of random seeds under the same setting is also missing. The authors are highly encouraged to provide the reward-step curve for DMControl experiments.\nThe author also mentioned they applied random plasma shadow as data augmentation, Is the augmentation applied to other baselines as well?\n\n5. Jointly optimizing the self-supervised loss with RL loss for pixel-based RL has been extensively explored in [1] and it seems [1] does not give a positive answer even with an evolutionary search on the combination of SSL losses. Does the improvement really come from the new method proposed in this paper, or only from the random plasma shadow?\n\n6. The reward curves in Figure 1 do not contain any axis labels.\n7. There are two Figure 9.\n\n### Reference\n[1] Li, Xiang, et al. \"Does self-supervised learning really improve reinforcement learning from pixels?.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 30865-30881."

The author claims that \"in different training phases, exploring visual semantic information can both enhance and impede the performance of learned feature representations.\" I would like to know when this exploration can lead to enhancement, and when it can prevent improvement.\n\n2. The author seems to have different viewpoints compared to SODA. In SODA, the author believes that as more factors of variation are introduced during training, optimization becomes increasingly challenging, which can lead to lower sample efficiency and unstable training. Therefore, they propose decoupling augmentation from policy learning. However, the author of the current study argues that the contrast-based training paradigm is decoupled from the policy network, which interferes with the training of the RL model and ultimately degrades its performance. Regarding the performance of PUPG under strong augmentation methods like random convolution, it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.\n\n3. Is there any quantitative evidence to demonstrate that redundant representations indeed lead to a reduction?\n\n4. Why is it said that DQN acquires representations with more task-relevant information than DrQ-v2?\n\n5. Many related methods have not been compared and analyzed. For example, the DrAC approach eliminates redundant representations by constraining the policy to be invariant to the augmented and non-augmented images. How does the author's approach compare to this method in terms of advantages?\n[1] Automatic Data Augmentation for Generalization in Reinforcement Learning.\n[2] Action-driven contrastive representation for reinforcement learning.\n[3] TACO: Temporal Latent Action-Driven Contrastive Loss for Visual Reinforcement Learning.\n[4] Return-Based Contrastive Representation Learning for Reinforcement Learning.\n6.
