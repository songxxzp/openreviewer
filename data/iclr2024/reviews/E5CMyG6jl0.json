                "value": "This paper presents a unified framework that integrates the two traditionally separate processes in LLM alignment: SFT on demonstration data and preference learning on preference data. The framework is structured for point-wise preference learning, considering the intrinsic characteristics of real-world preference data distribution. Specifically, the authors treat the positive and negative samples differently, applying SFT loss to the former and adding an additional KL regularizer for the latter. They also justify this formulation via gradient analysis and comparison with DPO. Since the method enhances learning from the positive samples, the authors extend the Anthropic's Helpful and Harmless dataset by refining the positive responses using GPT-4, thus boosting their method with high-quality data."

                "value": "Reward modeling is a crucial and challenging part in LLM alignment. Conventionally, preference data is collected through rankings and used as preferred\u2013dispreferred pairs for learning, as the human-annotated scalar scores on individual samples can be uncalibrated and noisy. However, the ranking-based reward model may fail to impose correct penalty, since it is trained based on binary relative signals, potentially compromising its precision on individual samples. In this case, I agree with the authors that pair-wise RM may inadequately capture the nuances of real-world preference data distribution, especially on the data where preferences are obviously polarized and scoring quality against specific criteria is unambiguous. Therefore, I think it is important to explore the point-wise RM for better preference learning in LLM alignment."

                "value": "While preference learning from pair-wise data is challenging (as I briefly discussed above), it still applies to most cases in the real world. For example, toxicity is not a strictly binary metric as we can categorize samples to be _toxic_, _very toxic_, or just _pose risks of toxic content generation_ [1]. Also for verifiability, there can be labels such as _unhedged correct_, _hedged correct_, and _uninformative_. So I don\u2019t think the authors made a convincing argument regarding the superiority of their point-wise preference learning over the pair-wise methods. In fact, the binary signals could result in significant information loss, since the learning can only capture the data polarity, omitting the nuanced levels present in practice.\n\nAdditionally, the paper lacks empirical analysis with limited experimental results to justify the design of each component in Equation (9). It is hard to interpret how the win rates evaluated by GPT-4 correlate with human judgment or the actual quality. For example, if I understand it correctly, the baseline to compare against is the chosen answer in the dataset, which can be considered as the golden samples for preference learning. This makes the numbers of win-rates in Tables 1&2 somewhat weird and vague since there should be a big proportion of tie cases as indicated in previous works [2]. It\u2019d help to report on metrics that are consistent with existing works for clear and interpretable result comparison. It is also important to extend the evaluation to other benchmarks, _e.g._, RealToxicityPrompts [1], to compare their effectiveness at least in the domain of harmlessness.\n\n---\n[1] Gehman et al.

However, one essential issue is that in many cases, there can be a mapping function between pair-wise preference and point-wise preference. For example, from pair-wise -> point-wise: you can directly enumerate how many positive preferences have been received for each document, and then rank the documents according to the numbers and assign a ranking score to each document. Or, a simpler way is to use the number of (positive num \u2013 negative num) preferences as the point-wise preference. Therefore, to verify the idea of studying the point-wise human preference. Similarly, point-wise -> pair-wise, one document with higher scores can receive the positive preference. One must prove that these rule-based methods can not work well for the LLM. Also, to test the performance of an LLM, there are many evaluation metrics and many LLM-based tasks. Therefore, I expect the authors to test the LLM for more tasks and metrics. Also, more LLMs are expected. For the reported tables, many numbers are quite close, and it is necessary to have a significance test to see whether the proposed method is better (or you can report the mean and std for multiple runs). Overall, I like this idea, but this version may not be ready for publication. If you can answer the above question or point out my misunderstanding, I will be happy to raise my score."

In this paper, the authors propose a new DPO method to align LLM with point-wise preference data. Standing on the proposed point-wise DPO method, they incorporate supervised fine-tuning, unifie the whole alignment framework, and solve it as a one-step alignment problem.
