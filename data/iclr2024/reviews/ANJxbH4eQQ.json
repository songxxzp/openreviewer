                "value": "The paper addresses a common issue in design problems. Given a expensive-to-evaluate function $f(x)$ and an initial set of training points, the goal is to find points $x$ where $f(x)$ is maximised. In model-based optimization (MBO) approaches, the idea is to iteratively train a surrogate model to approximate $f(x)$ using the existing data and use it to generate new data. However, the common issue here is that the initial points may not be sampled i.i.d. from the input space, leading to a distribution shift problem.\n\nThe paper addresses the issue by training a binary classifier, which they call it Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) classifier, to predict whether the input comes from the training data or from the design data, and uses the classifier's logit to derive a notion called OOD score that can be used to weight the input towards the distribution of the design data. Using the OOD scores, they show how the distribution shift problem can be largely mitigated.\n\nExperiments were conducted in a 2D toy model, a simulated protein structure design, and the design of AAV capsid protein."

The RND is estimated by a function of the prediction scores of the classifier, named as the propensity score, which matches with the OOD score of the paper.\n\nIf we take OOD classifier/score out of consideration then unfortunately the remaining contributions are not sufficient for me to recommend acceptance."

However, there are *no* experiments that directly test the impact of this approach. The fidelity between OOD metrics and model errors are presented, but no results demonstrate that incorporating the OOD classifier in the MBO search procedure improves the quality of proposed designs. As far as I understand, the analysis on the AAV data in section 4.3 does not actually incorporate the OOD classifier to change the library of selected AAV sequences. Instead, a library was generated without the paper's proposed MBO approach, and then some analysis was done retrospectively to argue that perhaps using the OOD classifier would have been helpful. Given that the paper provides a concrete proposal for an MBO algorithm, there needs to be a head-to-head comparison between this approach and a baseline approach. This could be done easily, for example, on the synthetic 2D data of Sec 4.1.\n\nOOD detection seems like an unreliable way to reason about where the model will reliably be able to extrapolate, since it only looks at the P(x) distribution of training data, not the distribution P(y|x) or labels or anything about the particular inductive biases and invariances of the model being used to make predictions. In particular, many modern predictive models use some sort of pretraining on natural protein sequences. How does this impact your assumptions?"

                "value": "I find the overall flow of the proposed algorithm a bit confusing. If I understand correctly, the approach is this: fit a predictive model, run some sort of search algorithm to find points with high predictive model score, train an OOD classifier where the positive examples are the points from the previous step and the negative examples are the training data used to train the predictive model, re-run the search algorithm using a modified objective that combines the scores of the OOD model with the original model. Is this correct?\n\nAs far as I can tell, the data used for fig 3 came from a single round of MBO; only one additional wet-lab experiment was run, and it was run on sequences from the entire trajectory of the Adalead optimizer used for finding sequences with high model score. I understand that wet-lab experiments are expensive, and that multiple rounds of experiments would be infeasible. However, I don't understand the point of focusing on the 15 steps of the Adalead algorithm. This method should be treated as a black-box search algorithm used for finding high-scoring sequences. Why was experimental capacity spent on sequences from the early iterations of Adalead?\n\nI don't understand this:\n'' In contrast, the Deep Ensemble scores cannot effectively serve as a quantitative predictor of shift intensity.' Why not?\n\nSection 4.2 is extremely terse. What is the key take-away point from it that suggests it should appear in the paper?\n\nThere need to be far more details about the AAV setup. Is the data public? Will it be released with the paper? How big is it? How long is the sub-sequence of the protein that was mutated? \n\nPerhaps I'm misunderstanding things.

                "value": "This work presents a method for detecting out-of-distribution samples drawn in model-based optimization ML-guided design. The main idea is that black-box MBO may when optimizing some target function result in designing (drawing from the input space) a sample that is OOD w.r.t the available training data. At the same time, these OOD samples are those for which the performance of the target function predictor is less reliable and therefore undesirable as design choices. Shift between training and design distributions are measured via a shift detection model that classifies samples coming from each distribution. The OOD detection is then used to limit the search space in the design process to those with low \u201cOOD scores,\u201d i.e. close to the distribution of the desired data."

                "value": "Addresses an important problem in ML-guided design where under-represented regions of the input space are exploited by the surrogate prediction model.  \n\nBy using a distribution classifier, avoids estimating the distribution of the respective data sub-spaces directly. This is especially important to allow for high-dimensional data and avoids setting limiting assumptions on their distribution.   \n\nSynthetic and real experiments show the design shift problem and well motivate the use of OOD detection in MBO design pipelines"
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "This approach overly constricts the search space of allowable design samples. The OOD scores rely on a classifier that considers only the data, and therefore is only effective to combat covariate shift. This means that design samples will be forced to be similar to training samples, even if distant samples in the input space could still have correct surrogate model predictions."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Q1] The statement that distribution shifts in supervised regression \u201ctypically takes the form of covariate shift\u201d is not well supported. Assuming covariate shifts is ones of the most restrictive assumptions on shift since the model predictions p(y|x) is unchanged between training and test/design distribution. Can you expand on this argument for focusing on this type of error?\n\nQ2] Several approaches to refining the search space in ML-guided design are discussed in Section 3 (first paragraph). Why were these not used as baseline comparisons in the experiments?"
