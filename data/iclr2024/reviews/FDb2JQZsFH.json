What type of mistakes are made by the baselines and eliminated by the new approach? How do they behave over examples with unseen names (systematic generalization cases)?

                "value": "Background information: TPRs are an approach for representing compositional structure in vector space; they work by encoding a compositional structure via pairs of fillers - the components of the structure - and roles - the positions of the fillers in the structure. For instance, in the sentence \u201ccats chase dogs\u201d, the fillers could be the words \u201ccats\u201d, \u201cchase\u201d, and \u201cdogs\u201d, and the roles could be \u201csubject\u201d, \u201cverb\u201d, and \u201cobject\u201d, respectively. Each filler and each role is represented with a vector, and these vectors are then combined via tensor products and matrix addition to produce a representation for the whole compositional structure.\n\nWhat this paper does: The authors introduce an approach called Attention-based Iterative Decomposition (AID) designed to generate role and filler representations for models based on Tensor Product Representations (TPRs). TPRs require the input to be broken down into fillers and roles (both represented as vectors), and this is what AID is designed to do; it can be plugged into any TPR-based system as a way to produce the fillers and roles, which can then be processed in the way they normally are for TPRs. AID starts with an initial proposal for the values of the role and filler vectors. These values are then iteratively updated; at each iteration, each TPR component (i.e., role or filler) attends to the input elements, and the TPR components compete with each other for which component attends to which input element. The result of the attention process at each iteration is a new proposal for the role and filler vectors, which is then the input to the next iteration, until the iteration finishes and the final role and filler vectors are produced. The authors then run experiments where they test 3 TPR-based systems from prior work on 4 tasks that involve systematic generalization. They find that adding the AID module improves compositional generalization across tasks."

Therefore, it\u2019s possible that the improvements created by AID are due to having more parameters rather than due to the effectiveness of the strategy. For most of the experiments, the difference in performance is so large that it\u2019s probably not solely due to number of parameters, but for the Wikitext experiment, the improvement that AID brings is pretty small, so it does seem like a more important concern there. The most convincing way to address this concern would be have the same number of parameters in the model version that has AID and the model version that doesn\u2019t; this could be achieved by, for example, making the feedforward size a bit smaller in the AID version than the non-AID version.\n- W2: I believe that the paper mischaracterizes the binding problem. The binding problem is the question of how different attributes of a structure can be appropriately bound together; for example, given an image with a red square and a blue triangle, how can a system appropriately associate (that is, bind) colors and shapes in order to represent the fact that you have a red square and a blue triangle, rather than a blue triangle and a red square? There is a separate problem that I\u2019ll call the \u201cdecomposition problem\u201d (I don\u2019t think this is a standard term, but it will be useful for this review), which is how to decide what the attributes of a structure are. The paper seems to use the term \u201cbinding\u201d or \u201cbinding problem\u201d when in fact what it talks about is the decomposition problem. Specific places where this occurs are in the abstract (\u201cbecause of the incomplete bindings\u201d, \u201ccan effectively improve the binding\u201d), the second paragraph of the intro (\u201cthese works still have a binding problem\u201d), and the first section of related work (\u201cBinding problem\u201d). The reason why I think that this work is not really about binding is that the part of the TPR formalism that does binding is the step where tensor products are used to combine fillers and roles; the AID module does not alter that portion of the formalism, which is why, properly speaking, I believe it is really about decomposition rather than binding. I would recommend updating the wording to clarify this point. \n- W3: I think the paper is not as careful as it should be at distinguishing facts (things that have been empirically demonstrated), goals (things that the authors want to achieve), and plausible guesses (things that we think are likely to be true but can\u2019t be certain of). I would recommend rewording the paper to be more careful about these points; as it stands, some points are presented as facts when I believe they are in fact goals or plausible guesses, and this could potentially mislead readers about how clearly these points have been demonstrated. Here are the specific points that stood out to me:\n    - The intro says \u201cthese works still have a binding problem \u2026 because the decomposition mechanism they employed relies on a simple MLP, which is known to be not effective in capturing the compositional nature of data.\u201d I think that this is plausible but not something that can definitively be stated as a fact; a way to more clearly state what is known vs. not known would be \u201cwe find that these approaches still show some difficulties on compositional generalization, likely because the decomposition mechanism they employed relies on a simple MLP, which may not be sufficiently structured to learn the compositional nature of the data.\u201d Specific motivations for these edits: adding \u201clikely\u201d to signal that this explanation is plausible but can\u2019t be definitively said to be the cause; add \u201cmay\u201d for a similar reason; changing \u201ccapture\u201d to \u201clearn\u201d, because an MLP can capture anything (it\u2019s a universal function approximator), so the actual difficulty would be when it needs to learn something.\n    - At the start of section 2, I think the word \u201ceffectively\u201d should be removed from \u201cwe illustrate how the AID module effectively decomposes\u201d. This section doesn\u2019t show that the AID is effective - that is not demonstrated until later, when there are empirical results. Similarly, near the top of page 4, I would remove the word \u201ceffectively\u201d again; I don\u2019t think this work demonstrates that competitive attention on its own is effective at decomposing (as opposed to competitive attention being effective when used in combination with the rest of AID, such as the appropriate initial_components).\n    - At the start of section 3, and at the end of \u201cDisentanglement analysis\u201d under 3.1.1, I would recommend removing the word \u201cconsequently\u201d. That word asserts a causal connection that has not been demonstrated (we know that the model gets better disentanglement and better task performance, but we can\u2019t be certain that one causes the other); a more valid way to phrase this would be \u201cThese results demonstrate the AID module\u2019s efficacy in capturing underlying factors during TPR component generation, which may explain why the AID improves task performance.\u201d\n    - Near the top of page 7, it says that AID generates \u201cmore accurate representations.\u201d I don\u2019t think that \u201caccurate\u201d is the right word here; a better phrasing might be \u201crepresentations that better conform to the formal requirements that Smolensky established for ideal TPRs\u201d\n- W4: Some aspects of the experimental setup were not clear to me. First is what the input features are; see Q1 below. Second is that I found it somewhat difficult to understand exactly how the tasks worked; this concern could be addressed by providing some examples of the tasks (ideally in the main paper, or in an appendix if there isn\u2019t room). For example, it\u2019s not clear to me what the inputs are in the SAR task - is it just one x and one y? Or a sequence of x\u2019s and y\u2019s, and if so how are they arranged - x y x y x y, or x x x y y y? And how is the model presented with an x?\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this paper, but I do think that these concerns currently decrease the paper\u2019s understandability as well as the confidence that we can place in its results. If these concerns are addressed, I would be open to raising my score.\n\nUPDATE: The author response has sufficiently addressed my concerns. Therefore, I have raised my score from 5 to 8; previously I said 5 because my concerns prevented me from recommending acceptance, but with these concerns addressed I believe that the paper's helpful contributions are now effectively highlighted, enabling me to happily recommend acceptance."

                "value": "- Q1: What are the input features? I was unable to figure this out. Specifically, is each input feature one object (such as one word)? Or is it one element within a vector representation? From most of the paper I was assuming that it was one object. However, I normally associate the word \u201cfeature\u201d with an element of a vector representation. Also, if the input features are objects, that makes me confused about why N_inputs is considered a hyperparameter in Figure 5, since that\u2019s really a property of the task rather than a hyperparameter. One thing that could help to clarify this is to show an actual example from an actual task in Figure 1, so that we can see what wach input feature is in the context of that task.\n- Q2: Near the top of page 4, it says that producing initial_components from the concatenated input features assigns symbolic meanings to each component, such as roles and fillers. I don\u2019t understand how it achieves this. I can understand why this would be useful (because it would provide a better/optimized starting point), but I don\u2019t see how it pushes each component to have a particular symbolic meaning such as \u201croles\u201d or \u201cfillers\u201d"
