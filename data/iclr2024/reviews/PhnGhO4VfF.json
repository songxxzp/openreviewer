In Definition 4.2 regarding 'hard samples', this paper characterizes them based on the introduction of random noise. However, merely adding random noise doesn't necessarily make a sample challenging to classify. Learning with noise is different from learning with hard samples.

It explores the 'fine-to-coarse' transfer learning scenario, where pre-training labels are more detailed than those of the target task. The study finds that pre-training with the most detailed labels from ImageNet21k leads to improved transfer performance on ImageNet1k, a practice commonly adopted within the community. The paper offers a theoretical perspective, suggesting that fine-grained pre-training enables DNNs to learn not just common features but also those that are rare or specific, thereby enhancing accuracy on more challenging test samples that lack strong common features. Extensive experiments with iNaturalist 2021's label hierarchies indicate that effective transfer requires a meaningful label hierarchy and alignment between pre-training and target label functions.\n\n# Post-rebuttal\nBased on the current limited empirical evidence and all I suggested experiments are promised to be done in the future work, I'd like to lower my score. \n\nHowever, I'd like to emphasize to AC, my evaluation is based on the empirical evidence only."

There are some datasets are studied in low-shot learning could be used in this sceneries.\n\n- Studying how to obtain the hierarchy/fine-grained labels for unlabeled datasets. It's hard, costly, and usually \"impossible\" to obtain the used hierarchy for large-scale dataset; therefore, it's important to have discussion and analysis here. The paper currently provided a simple study on Section 5.2. However, I expect more analysis such as how should we decide class-level for unlabeled dataset.

I am not sure if the experiments on ImageNet and iNaturalist are sufficient to support the presented theory (could you please elaborate a bit on that if that is the case). One suggestion (that should be doable and easy to implement) would be to generate synthetic data and confirm that Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 hold on it, exploring and explaining the impact of the different parameters needed by your theory.\n\nJain et al., Test-Time Amendment with a Coarse Classifier for Fine-Grained Classification, NeurIPS 2023"

                "value": "Q1: Just to confirm: When fine-tuning, you do fine-tune the whole network, i.e., you do not keep the feature extractor fixed. It is a bit surprising to me that regardless of the pretraining granularity (e.g. on Fig. 1 and Table 1), the fine-tuned model does not catch up with the baseline training, assuming that sufficient time for finetuning is given.\n\nQ2: Is the granularity solely determined by the number of classes or number of classes AND class level in hierarchy? Do we assume that all classes in a given (pre)training dataset are at the same hierarchy level? What if we mix classes from different levels in the class hierarchy during the pretraining?\n\nQ3: Could you please provide some intuition why you need the different patches and how do they relate to real-world image inputs? If I understand correctly, it is the same intuition as in Fig. 2 and the different patches represent different parts of the image (which may contain different common/rare features).\n\nQ4: If I understand correctly, the theorems require that the neural networks are trained only on \"easy\" samples. Why is that the case? If it is indeed needed, how can you distinguish between easy and hard samples during training?\n\nQ5: In the paper you perform experiments with ViT and ResNets. Based on your theory, in what way is the model important and what is its impact on the training? I.e., what properties are desirable for it?\n\nQ6: On iNaturalist (Fig. 4) why do you only report validation errors but omit the final accuracies? Are the accuracies consistent with the shown figure?\n\nMinor: In your examples (Sec 4) you consider mainly binary task (i.e., 2 coarse level classes). Can the theory and the theorems be extended to the multi-class setup?"
