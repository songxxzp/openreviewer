By decomposing the latent diffusion models into different components e.g. encoder, ResNet, denoising, and decoder, we can attack each module by maximizing the changes in output. For white box settings, through experiments, the authors find that attacking the output of the resnet seems to be more effective than other methods. Also, the authors run black box attacks for the first time for LDM, using prompt-transfer attacks and model-transfer attacks."

In addition to this vulnerability assessment, the paper makes significant strides in dataset construction, offering an automated pipeline that facilitates the evaluation of LDMs under adversarial conditions.

This may not comprehensively represent all latent diffusion models. I suggest the authors consider comparing with other models, such as UniDiffuser[1].\n\n2.\tLimited exploration of diverse attacks and defenses\u3002As the paper aims to explore the robustness of diffusion models from the perspective of adversarial attacks, the paper uses a limited range of attack methods, and the design of attacking method may lack novelty. Additionally, there is no new attack strategy developed based on the unique characteristics of diffusion. Furthermore, the defense methods chosen for experiments appear outdated. I recommend the authors consider incorporating a wider variety of attacks and defenses in their experiments.\n\n3.\tInsufficient discussion of denoising steps. In the experiments, the authors only consider 15 denoising steps for generating adversarial examples. However, according to the findings in DiffPure[2], longer denoising steps introduce randomness and enhance robustness. The authors could explore the impact of different denoising steps as a hyperparameter on diffusion model robustness.\n\n[1]Bao F, Nie S, Xue K, et al.
