The specific wording and informal perspective are different (in this submission, the \"implicit categorical feature\" perspective is suggested, while in `[1]` the motivation is more \"empirical\"), however, I see it as a stylistic difference: the call for action and the explored schemes are the same in nature.\n- the \"ICF\" methods and piecewise-linear encoding from `[1]` are formally different methods, however, on the low technical level, both aim to identify a chance to discretize a given continuous feature;\n- the LFF method is very similar (identical?) to either \"Periodic\" module from `[1]` or to Fourier Features themselves `[2]`.\n\nTo sum up, from my perspective, the key related work is not identified as such, the methods from this submission are similar to those from that related work, and the existing methods are not included as baselines.\n\n**(2) The paper introduces a custom non-trivial architecture which seems to be unrelated to the main topic of the paper.** Specifically, in the second paragraph of Section 3, a custom architecture is introduced without any further discussion (also, to me, the usage of *convolutions* on tabular data problems is not intuitive and deserves its own discussion, or even its own paper). Unfortunately, it makes it hard to understand what is the core factor behind the reported results: the new architecture, the proposed methods or a combination thereof. I highly recommend to test the proposed methods on *existing* backbones (e.g. MLP and Transformer from `[3]`).\n\n**(3) Regarding the presentation,** I should admit that I understand the proposed methods and the backbone to the extent that is enough to write this review, but not enough to actually implement the methods and explain them to others.\n\n**(4) Experiments & Methodology.** \n- no baselines beyond MLP and XGBoosts\n- some of the datasets are represented multiple times in different forms. It makes the benchmark biased towards the repeated datasets and the notion of \"the number of datasets\" becomes less obvious.\n- etc.\n\nTo be more specific, let's consider Figure 1:\n- the figure presents 16 results, however, after removing duplicated datasets, only 11 results are left.\n- In the light of `[1]`, there are no performance gaps on the following datasets: covertype, eye movements, house 16H (also, the \"eye movements\" dataset contains a leak and is solvable with almost perfect accuracy; it is not a well known fact though).\n- On three (OnlineNews, wine quality, nyc-taxi) of the remaining 8 datasets, XGBoost wins.\n- Error bars are not presented, so it is hard to judge how significant the remaining 5 wins are.\n- Baselines are missing, so it can be the case that the remaining wins can be achieved with prior methods.\n\n**References**\n\n- `[1]` \"On Embeddings for Numerical Features in Tabular Deep Learning\" by Gorishniy et al.\n- `[2]` \"Fourier Features Let Networks Learn High Frequency Functions in Low Dimensional Domains\" by Tancik et al.\n- `[3]` \"Revisiting Deep Learning Models for Tabular Data\" by Gorishniy et al."

I.e., the particular model used and how it is applied, the fourier features, and the implicit categorical feature selection - none of these are clearly explained or described in enough detail to reproduce what was done.  Furthermore, what is described does not make much sense the way it is currently described.  As one example, it's stated at the beginning of modeling, a 1D CNN resnet is used - but not how this is applied to tabular data (which is not typical), what the architecture looks like or math equations, etc.  A machine learning practitioner would typically not think of applying convolution to tabular data, and the \"how\" and \"why\" of this is never explained.\n\n-There doesn't seem to be much novelty.  Most of the proposed elements were used in prior work, including learned fourier features, resnets, and identifying implicit categorical features (indeed Grinsztajn et al., 2022 included identifying implicit categorical features as part of their data processing pipeline, as can be seen in their publicly-released code as well). The exact same dataset and experiment setup is taken from prior work and it seems like this particular method is just plugged in.  Perhaps this particular way of applying 1D convolution has not been tried with tabular data before - I can't tell because it's not completely clear what exactly was done.  Even so the novelty is very limited.\n\n-There is no rational or explanation given for why something was done or why it might work / did work, and most of the proposed methods don't intuitively make sense.  E.g., why is chi-square test used to determine if a feature is implicitly categorical or not?  What is the rationale?  How does this make sense?  Similar how does it make sense to use 1D convolution with tabular data?  How does the excessive 0-padding make sense - if every numerical feature is also 0 padded to the maximum number of categories?  What about for the fourier features.\n--Similarly, there is no analyses of results or understandings given for why anything proposed worked and how it relates to the original motivating claims.\n\n-It's not clear how the different proposed components contribute to the improved accuracy - ideally there should be ablation study and more experiments understanding the impact of the different components. \n E.f., the different components before the neural net (identifying implicit categorical features, fourier feature transforms) should be used with other models as well, and the impact of the particular CNN model should be understood based on how it performs with and without each component as well.\n\n-Some claims are unsubstantiated.  E.g., the authors state: \"Grinsztajn et al. (2022) and Ng (2004) before them, establish that tabular data tends to lie in a natural base and that models which are invariant to rotation, such as the MLP, suffer from a higher sample complexity in the presence of noise. For this reason we select a 1D convolutional Residual Network (RESNET) to be our baseline and primary architecture since 1D convolutions are not invariant to arbitrary rotations or permutations of the data.\"  However, they do not show or cite that 1D CNN resnets are not invariant in the same way that MLPs are.  Since MLPs are a superset of CNNs (i.e. CNNs are MLPs with a special structure) - I doubt this claim.  The work that is cited does not mention CNNs at all.\n\n-I don't feel that using results based on random hyper parameter search is the most reasonable way to compare the different methods, as it's not what is typically done in practice."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the authors summarize the current literature well, the comparison between the literature and the proposed method is somewhat lacking. While it is not feasible to reimplement all the competing methods and evaluating them, at least some of them should be compared. In particular Kadra showed that simple networks can perform well, if tuned correctly, while this paper only uses a very limited search space for the baseline MLP.\n\nThe authors use a measure that I'm unfamiliar with for evaluation, 'p-range' and don't provide a reference for it. Using this and using unnormalized scores both seem non-standard, and are not in line with the measure in Grinsztajn, which uses ADTM. Other options would be critical difference diagrams or performance profiles.\n\nThe main novelty of this work is introduced in 3.2, so this aspect should be investigated in more detail. There is many choices in the detection of implicit categoricals, and not all off these are justified or even discussed. For example, it's unclear why implicitly categorical features should have low cardinality. For example a time series with discrete jumps is something that's hard to learn for an MLP and should probably qualify as implicitly categorical, but can have arbitrary many values.\nI find the definitions in 3.2.2 hard to follow and possibly an illustration would help, or maybe a reasoning why these are good criteria.\n\nThe choice of the channel-wise encoding of categorical variables seems odd, in particular since it seems that one category per variable is special, since it is the category with all the continuous features associated with it, while the others are permutation invariant - except that they depend on the permutation of the other features. The paper doesn't suggest an ordering of the categorical features, so this seems a bit strange.\n\nThe paper states that the current state-of-the-art on the Grinsztajn dataset is XGBoost, but I'm not sure if that is a fair characterization. Many of the works in the related work section simply have not been evaluated on this benchmark, as far as I know. As mentioned in the introduction, McElfresh showed that the gap between tree-based models and neural models is negligible for many datasets; I feel the phrasing in the rest of the paper should reflect that, in particular the second sentence of the introduction seems to contradict this.\n\nMinor nitpicks\nThe phrase \"natural base\" was not entirely obvious to me when first used, maybe a different phrase or explanation when first mentioned.\nThe Sentence defining ResNet+C is just after the definition of the Fourier features, which is a bit confusing, and ResNet+F is not defined at all. I assume that is a typo?\nIn the conclusion, the paper states that it reports on the prevalence of implicitly categorical features, which I think the paper does not. It would be very interesting to study the prevalence more directly, but this seems not to be included in the paper.\nI am also a bit ambivalent about the last statement about computational efficiency, since the paper uses a large search space and large computational budget to find good models."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Was there a reason not to include learning rate, batch size and schedules in the searches for ResNet and the MLP? These seem quite important.\nHow was the threshold for including the one regression dataset chosen? Since the scores are not normalized, there is no special meaning to 0.1, is there?\nHow are categories ordered in the multi-channel encoding of categorical variables?\nWhy was a 1x1 convolution resnet chosen, and how would it compare against a standard resnet? In particular, any resnet would not be permutation invariant with respect to features because of the skip connections, right? [if the number of hidden units was chosen as the number of features, which is quite smiliar to the 1d case in some sense]\nIs there a reference for the p-range metric?"
