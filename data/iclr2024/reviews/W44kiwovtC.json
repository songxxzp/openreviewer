It's notable in its absence, how come?\n- The authors explanation of how diversity is to be generated in CEs is too brief.  Section 3.2 very briefly states that the temperature parameter $t$ is used to add noise to the origins of the samples of $\\mathbf{z}_{test}$.  But does this offer *more* diversity of valid samples than a method like DiCE, which intentionally penalizes the covariance between sampled points?  It's unsatisfying.\n- The first paragraph in section 3 discusses some notation for CE generation, but states that: \n> The aim of CE is to generate perturbed inputs $\\mathbf{x}_{cf}$ such that $f(\\mathbf{x}_{cf})>f(\\mathbf{x})$ for the observed input x.\n\nThere are two mistakes here.  First is that  $>$ should be $!=$.  Second, it is far from settled what the benefits of CE are for, and is largely dependent on the person using the tool.  Users will take different insights from CEs than people building models, for example.  My reading of the paper of the paper suggests the authors are intending FastDCFlow to be a user-centric tool, so they should inform their perspective and their experiments accordingly.  Could they do a simulated user study, showing that FastDCFlow helps users make better decisions?  Or could they take an organizational risk perspective, showing that FastDCFlow helps an organization providing a model-based service make better (e.g fairer) decisions?"

Is this just an error in tense?  Or does the present implementation of TE not respect order?  Or something else?\n- The same paragraph of the conclusion continues\n> Although predicted target values between the ML model evaluations using TE and OHE showed no marked differences, effectively adapting conversion methods for compact datasets remain a challenge.\n\nI believe this statement needs way more unpacking.  If there were \u201cno marked differences\u201d between TE and OHE, I see two important questions that should be asked here:\n1. Why is this so?  Is this a consequence of the evaluation criteria for CEs?\n2. If OHE and TE don\u2019t show a marked difference, what\u2019s the justification for pursuing the integration of TE?"

The two main contributions involve a) using a latent space model and b) converting categorical features to continuous mappings. The first has been proposed many times in the literature, mostly using VAEs. Normalizing flows have also been used before in this context, as the paper references. The transformation of categorical features to continuous features is not new either, and as such, I find the paper's novelty somewhat lacking.\n- When considering the usual metrics proximity (P), validity (V) and run time (RT), the proposed method does not perform best across any one metric. The diversity metrics are questionable since they do not appear normalized, thus worse proximity is likely to promote better diversity (see questions).\n- The results therefore rely heavily on the proposed metrics, CV and CS, which themselves are left highly unjustified in the text. I do not find these functions particularly compelling, since CS relies on CV, which itself relies on the diversity metrics proposed."

Based on Table 1, Inner Diversity (ID) and Outer Diversity (OD) compute the average $\\ell_2$ differences between CEs for one test point and between CEs across multiple test points. Why was diversity not considered via the angle between CE perturbations rather than the $\\ell_2$ norm between raw CEs? Using the $\\ell_2$ norm alone means larger diversity can be achieved through CEs with very bad proximity.\n2. For the Bank dataset, FastDCFlow achieves proximity an order of magnitude worse than other methods (this is serious), and also achieves worse validity. Yet, FastDCFlow achieves an order of magnitude higher performance on the CS metric which is used for the final assessment of the methods. Proximity and validity are the two fundamental goals of counterfactual explanations, and in this case FastDCFlow fails on both fronts while being pushed as the method with the best overall score. Can the authors please provide further justification of the CS metric (mostly the diversity evaluation in the CV metric) in the context of the above example?"
