                "value": "The paper presents LEGO, Local-feature Enrichment and Global-content Orchestration, an architectural tweak to transformer-based diffusion models for unconditional and class-conditional image generation.\nThe core idea behind LEGO lies in applying self-attention blocks with varying patch sizes across the transformer, thereby allowing different blocks (called LEGO brick) to focus on different scales of reconstruction / image generation, e.g. blocks with small patches will naturally focus more on local reconstruction, while larger patch sizes encourage enforcing global consistency. Furthermore, each LEGO brick can be applied to a subset of local patches, thereby increasing compute efficiency. Another way in which LEGO allows more efficient generation at test time is to selectively disable some LEGO bricks at specific time steps: For example, the contribution of very local LEGO bricks with small patch sizes is negligible for early t-steps during inference as the local structure of the pixels will still vary heavily in subsequent time steps -- similarly, transformations with a wider receptive field can be dropped at later t-steps since the global structure of the image to be generated has already been decided in earlier time steps. Finally, the method allows variable-size (and aspect ratio) image generation, even after being trained on a fixed-sized image dataset.\nOverall, this method achieves competitive results with favourable compute cost."

Meanwhile the remaining sections obfuscate major questions, e.g. whether a LEGO brick is applied densely or sparsely or how the patches are selected.\n\n- The majority of the experiments and results are placed in the appendix, while a very large portion of the main paper is dedicated on an extensive introduction, related works, and more context setting at the start of the method section. The authors should strongly consider making the first 4 pages of the main paper significantly more concise, thereby allowing the main findings to move from the appdix to the experimental section of the main paper.\n\n- The graphic shown in right panel in Figure 1 is interesting, but there may be a better choice of representing the same data. Drawing circles with FLOPs as their radius makes differences between models appear much more significant than they are (since the difference in circle size == circle area grows with the square of the radius), making the plot somewhat misleading. A more common choice is a plot showing FID on the y-axis and FLOPs on the x-axis, where each model would be a single dot."

While there is lots of talk on modularity and skipping of blocks, these aspects are only explored in the appendix on 64x64 CelebA images, i.e. an easy data set at a resolution where inference speed ups are not very interesting. The aspect of incorporating a pretrained diffusion model is only explored as an ablation. Further, generating images larger than the training resolution is demonstrated with a few examples, which might also be obtained by cleverly leveraging prior works.\n\nGiven all these points it feels like the contribution is not as significant as suggested at the beginning of the paper. Experiments where skipping blocks at inference time yield substantial wallclock-time speedups for class conditional ImageNet generation at 256 or 512 pixels resolution would be more convincing. \n\nMinor: Page 6 typo: LEBO"
