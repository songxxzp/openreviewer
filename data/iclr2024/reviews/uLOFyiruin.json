Babel-ImageNet provides translations of (up to) 1000 ImageNet labels in 92 languages without relying on machine translation or manual annotation, just on a multilingual knowledge base. The study evaluates several multilingual CLIP models on the proposed benchmark and shows significant performance disparities, with low-resource languages showing (as expected) the greatest performance gap. Additionally, the paper presents an approach for enhancing the performance of multilingual CLIP models in those low-resource languages."

However, BabelNet is automated and has a known percentage of error, potentially affecting the label mapping [1];\n- Using WordNet synsets for translations may introduce limitations, as not all concepts or words have direct equivalents in WordNet or BabelNet, potentially impacting the completeness of translations for some languages.\n- While the paper emphasizes the creation of the benchmark and model evaluation, it could benefit from a deeper analysis of why certain languages perform poorly according to the chosen metrics and explore potential solutions to address these disparities;\n- Considering that the paper belongs to the \"datasets and benchmarks\" area, the methodology employed (mapping from ImageNet to WordNet and then to BabelNet) is expectedly straightforward.  However, I think there's also some weakness in the data cleaning and validation since the obtained multilingual data is used to evaluate models, but those same benchmarks cannot be used to assess the quality of the data itself;\n- The paper's process of removing words with identical English counterparts in the class label translation and cleaning may not be fully justified, as there can be legitimate shared words between the English and language-specific vocabulary;\n\n[1] Ten Years of BabelNet: A Survey.

I'd like to kindly ask the authors what they think about it or if they have alternative ideas toward strengthening data validation, which I think is the strongest weakness in this current version of the manuscript;\n- Not a direct weakness, so I'm listing it here: multiple usages of the verb \"demonstrate\" (e.g., \"we demonstrate that OpenCLIP performance strongly correlates with the distribution of languages in LAION5B\" ). Personally, given the empirical nature of this work, I wouldn't suggest using such a theoretical-related term;\n\nGiven the doubts about the data validation, I'm starting the discussion period leaning toward rejection. However, I'm open to changing my assessment in light of the rebuttal discussions and the reviews of my colleagues.\n\n[1] Fatality Killed the Cat or: BabelPic, a Multimodal Dataset for Non-Concrete Concepts.
