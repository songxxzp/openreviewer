To address this, the authors propose an efficient strategy called  AQOT, based on the concept of Optimal Transport (OT). AQOT leverages OT to measure the difference between instance distributions, allowing for a balance between informativeness and representativeness. The method efficiently selects instances based on the sparsity of OT solutions and can be adapted to multiple classification models. Experimental results indicate that AQOT outperforms other active learning approaches in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency."

The main results focus on binary classification problems and there does not seem to be a way to generalize. The compared baselines are mostly older methods, with more recent deep active learning (WAAL from [1], classic methods like BatchBALD [3] Kirsch, Andreas, Joost Van Amersfoort, and Yarin Gal. \"Batchbald: Efficient and diverse batch acquisition for deep bayesian active learning.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 32 (2019). and so on) or even binary classification active learning ([4] Raj, Anant, and Francis Bach. \"Convergence of uncertainty sampling for active learning.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

                "value": "This paper proposed a new active learning query score for pool-based setting. The score is composed by three parts: certainty, uncertainty, and dynamic adjustment term. The main novelty comes from the certainty term, which is measured by the absolute difference of standard deviations of coefficient vectors of the optimal transports from the candidate unlabeled point to positive set and negative set. The intuition is that the coefficient vector is sparse and hence is of high variance when transporting to the set with the same label, but more uniform if it\u2019s transporting to a different class. The optimal transport can be efficiently solved by an existing algorithm after adding entropy regularization.  Uncertainty is simply the inverse of margin, and the dynamic adjustment is the sum of distance to a labeled set, weighted by a parameter that diminishes as iterations go, which encourages exploration in the beginning. Experiments show superior performance on six UCI datasets with 3 typical learning algorithms such as SVM, GBDT, NN. Ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the importance of each term and how sensitive the entropy regularization parameter is and the empirical optimal range of the relative importance between the certainty and uncertainty terms."
