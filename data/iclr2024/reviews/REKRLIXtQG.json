The authors mainly consider two concrete models: matroid-constrained maximization and set function ratio minimization. In the first model, we are given a monotone, non-negative function $f$ with generalized curvature $\\alpha$ and submodularity ratio $\\gamma$, and a matroid system $M$. The goal is to pick an element subset $S\\in M$ such that $f(S)$ is maximized. The authors prove that there exists a framework such that by applying it to any approximation algorithm with $O(q(m))$ queries ($q(\\cdot)$ is a polynomial function), a better approximation ratio can be obtained in time $O(2^{r-1}n^{r-1} q(n))$, where $r$ is the elementary submodular rank. In the second model, we are given two set functions $f, g$ and the goal is to pick a subset $S$ such that $f(S)/g(S)$ is minimized. The authors prove that when $f,g$ are normalized positive monotone functions and $f$ has a bounded elementary submodular rank, they obtain an approximation ratio polynomially that was previously only available when function $f$ was submodular. Finally, the authors conduct experiments to investigate the empirical performance of the algorithms."

In these problems, we are given a supermodular/submodular or a related function defined over a ground set. The goal is to select a certain subset of the ground elements such that (1) the selected subset satisfies some properties; (2) the value of the selected subset is optimized. If a function is not submodular/supermodular, one can describe it into several parameters, and the approximation ratio shall also be related to these parameters.\n\nThe main contribution of this work is a new approach to grading the space of set function. They propose a new concept called supermodular/submodular rank, which is defined over a partial order set. Based on such a concept, they show that a function can be decomposed into a summation of several \\p-supermodular/submodular functions. Then, one can improve the approximation by such a splitting."

To my knowledge, there is no such definition and decomposition in the literature. Probably the most related one is that a submodular function can be decomposed into n! additive functions, but the definition used in this paper is quite different from this."

Without this knowledge, it's hard to get the definition of \\pi-supermodular. After moving, it seems that the authors didn't do careful proofreading. For example, R(alpha, gamma) in Theorem 25 is not defined. This significantly impairs readability. I appreciate that the authors also try to explain their ideas with some examples, and I also understand that the space issue is not the authors' fault, but it is a fact that the paper does need a better presentation.\n\n2. To my understanding of Table 2, the proposed algorithm improves the previous ratio only in the case where the elementary submodular rank is a constant. If this is true, it\u2019s not clear how important this improvement is. Because the paper didn't include a discussion about whether there exists some famous functions with a constant submodular rank. Besides this, the paper only includes an upper bound on the rank of a function but excludes the way to compute the rank of a function. Maybe I missed something, and such a computation is trivial, but this should be stated explicitly."

The main reason behind this suggestion is that I think the paper can be presented much better without the practical part (which is not convincing in my opinion), which can be replaced by highlighting some non-trivial theoretical results such as Theorem 10."
