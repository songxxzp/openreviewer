                "value": "This paper provides a methodology for learning a policy given human intervention. Unlike other imitation learning frameworks such as Dagger, the method does not directly clone the actions taken by the expert, but rather uses the expert\u2019s decision to intervene as a negative reward signal. The paper claims that by doing so, the learned policy has the potential to exceed the performance of a suboptimal expert, and does not need to assume the expert is optimal. The method is demonstrated experimentally in simulation to outperform imitation learning baselines, and is demonstrated to work in a real world experiment. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify the method."

What does the analysis tell us? \n\nGrammar:\n- \u201c\u2026for selecting when to intervene lead to good performance\u2026\u201d\n- \u201cWe leave the of DAgger analysis under\u2026\u201d"

Wouldn\u2019t this result in actions taken by the expert being labeled -1 too? \n- Could the else statement in line 7 of Algorithm 2 set the reward to the RL reward signal if it were available? \n- I\u2019m very confused by this sentence: \u201cthe performance of DAgger-like algorithms will be subject to the suboptimality of the experts, while our method can reach good performance even with suboptimal experts by learning from the expert\u2019s decision of when to intervene.\u201c If no task reward is provided, how could the policy end up outperforming the expert?\n- How do you end up with a 110% expert if the expert level is w.r.t an expert trained to near optimality?\n- It seems unfair that Dagger variants are given 100 episodes to learn from while RLIF gets 1 million. It is also unrealistic to expect that we could have 1 million episodes in any real-world setting. How would RLIF perform if also restricted to a more realistic 10-100 episodes?\n- In experiments, do you warm start the dataset for RLIF? If so, with what reward? And does this pose an unfair advantage to your algorithm?"
