More precisely, the authors propose to subtract the Double-Q objective by a \"std\" term, computed as the standard deviation of the two Q-value networks. Experiments are provided to compare the new modification with existing Q-learning algorithms, using tasks from the Mujoco simulation.\n\n## After rebuttal\n\n\nI cannot access the responses to my three questions.\n\nThe other responses did not solve my primary concern that the paper's contribution is too incremental and lacks in-depth analysis. I, therefore, maintain my score."

The new term is also easy to implement."

                "value": "The contributions are too incremental. It is just a minor adaptation of the Double Q-learning algorithm. The majority of the paper is devoted to describing well-known methods. The main idea is presented in less than 2 pages with little insight.\n\nIn fact, the term \"std\" is just to reduce the absolute gap between the two value networks, and I do not see it should be considered as a significant contribution. Moreover, computing standard deviation using only two samples is nonsense to me. The regularizer term is just to reduce the gap between two Q-values, so something like |Q_1 \u2013 Q_2| would be enough. The authors should not name this term as \"standard deviation.\"\n\nThe experiments are not very convincing. For instance, Table 4 shows that the average improvement rate is negative (so the new approach is worse than its counterpart)."

                "value": "This paper proposes a variant of value-based policy optimization methods that can be applied to several deep RL algorithms.\nIn particular, for any algorithm with one or more copies of the Q-function approximator, the authors propose to measure the \"disagreement\" among the two (ore more) models on a batch of state-action pairs as the average (over the batch) of the empirical standard deviation (across the Q functions), and subtract to the Q-learning target a penalty that is proportional to this measure of disagreement. The intuitive idea is to be conservative (that is, underestimate the Q value) whenever there is a lot of uncertainty, testified by the disagreement. This technique can be used in several deep RL algorithms: double Q-learning, DDPG, TD3, and more. The benefits of this technique are tested on Mujoco and D4RL tasks, comparing with the performance of the original algorithms (TD3, TD7, MaxMin Q-Learning, REDQ)."

A small variant is applied on top of state-of-the art deep RL algorithms to show some improvement in the learning curves.\nFirst of all, the improvement is not particularly consistent over the different algorithms and tasks that are considered. In many of them, the improvement is not statistically significant, and there is even a slight degradation in some cases.\nMore importantly, there is no strong motivation underlying the proposed technique, besides the brief intuitive motivation that is provided. Previous approaches to mitigate the overestimation bias of Q-learning are mentioned, but not discussed critically. Nor did the author discuss the similarities between the proposed approach and other methods that try to capture the uncertainty of value estimates, such as distributional RL or ensembles. The latter were only mentioned as another family of algorithms that may benefit from Q-function disagreement.\nSimilarly, there is no in depth discussion on why the proposed technique works in some cases, and not in others. There is no theory or ablation studies to understand the effect of the proposed algorithmic addition in better detail.\nThe writing, although generally good, seems rushed in some ways: for example, many parentheses are missing from the citations."
