This is highly confusing for me because in my opinion this is the true challenge. Once you have it and test on a problem that requires it, then clearly it will work better. \n\nGenerally, the paper introduces POMDP and other formalisms in solid detail. I partially can imagine moving some of these parts to the appendix. They do not really reveal what the authors have actually done in the end. \n\nI went astray on how the FSA model is learned. What is the actual input given to the learner to learn the FSA model, and how is it then actually used to infer the reward function. Given a model such as the ones depicted in Figure 2b and c, then I can well imagine how this is done. The model learning is hardest. The authors here write about \u201cHand-crafted\u201d features in the reward function learning subsection. The RM structure learning is referred to other work without providing any intuition. \n\nI am also fully left astray what the actual observations / state representations are that you feed into your model. It, for example, (as you must well-know) makes a huge difference if you have the possible state space S given a priori or if you really only have access to observations O without any prior knowledge of the potential structure of S. \n\nSeeing these weaknesses, I currently cannot recommend publication. But, to be honest, I am at this point rather uncertain about the details and their potential merit."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Fundamentally, while interesting, I do not believe that ICLR is the right venue for SMIRL. ICLR is a conference where \u201clearning representations\u201d is part of the name, and SMIRL fundamentally relies on fixed representations with propositional logic. The foundations for SMIRL, which is the reward machine approach, are consistently published in AI venues such as JAIR, IJCAI or AAAI because the audiences there are more appreciative of these approaches, and have the background to better appreciate this kind of work. My comments below are therefore intended to help improve the clarity of the paper, but I believe it would be better suited to a different venue.\n\n### Unclear methodological contribution, restructuring of related work / background needed ###\nThe paper has an unusual structure for a machine learning paper, where the related work and background section are not separated. They are instead joined under \u201cPreliminaries and background\u201d. This section is not well structured, and it is therefore very difficult to determine what is novel about the presented method.\n\nFor example, the first three subsections of \u201cPreliminaries and background\u201d are obviously applicable to all IRL models, and so that seems appropriate. However, diving into MaxEnt IRL, there is already some confusion, as SMIRL relies on MaxEnt IRL as a sub-routine, but also distinguishes itself from MaxEnt IRL by using a Reward Machine (from my understanding based on reading the rest of the paper). Similarly, the next section on \u201cIRL with Partial Observability\u201d mentions a separate approach from Choi and Kim, but which has no connection to the SMIRL method (other than being a piece of related work, but it is not a preliminary). The final paragraph returns to Reward Machine, which SMIRL is based on, but slightly different from, in ways that are not clear from reading these sections. \n\nTo help a reader understand what the new methodological contribution is, there should be separate \u201cbackground\u201d and \u201crelated work\u201d sections, that clearly distinguish SMIRL from alternative approaches. Otherwise it is very difficult to determine how it is different from, e.g. Icarte et al 2018, or MaxEnt IRL.\n\nTo further demonstrate this point, in the Appendix the paper states: \u201c\u201c... to the best our knowledge, learning the motif on continuous 3D domains with complex logic (see SMIRL Algorithm) is not undertaken in prior works. While this difference can be argued as meagre for 2D toy like domains, but is significant for continuous domains, because \u2018Tabu search\u2019 for state space is computationally infeasible in such complex domains. Thus, this insight is more applicable in solving IRL in real-world robotic or embodied-ai domains commensurate with the motivation of our work.\u201d\n* It was not at all obvious to me that this was the main point of the paper. Since it is not explained how the SMIRL method differs from the Icarte et al, 2018 work, I could not determine that this was the main methodological novelty. Furthermore, the main method description states that Tabu search is being used (\u201cIn order to learn the RM\u2019s structure, we build on the method described in Toro Icarte et al. (2019), where Tabu search Glover & Laguna (1998) is used to compute an RM\u2026\u201d), so I fundamentally misunderstand something about the way the method works. If this is the main methodological difference, the experiments performed should all be on 3D, continuous domains, since that is what differentiates SMIRL from prior work.\n\n### More relevant baselines are needed ###\nIn the limitations & future work section, the paper notes:\n\u201c Choi & Kim Choi et al. included a detailed exploration in this setting, and future work might compare our model\u2019s performance against the three approaches that use sampled trajectories (Max-margin between values (MMV), Max-Margin between feature expectations (MMFE), and the projection (PRJ) methods) and corresponding domain experiments. However, we notice that these methods are derivatives or extensions of algorithms outlined in Abbeel & Ng (2004); Ng et al. (2000), therefore they may have been subsumed by our baselines used, making a proxy comparison with these approaches.\u201d\n* I do not believe this is a good reason for not running relevant baselines. As discussed in the survey paper linked to throughout the paper (Arora & Doshi, 2020), these methods do have important innovations that make them more applicable to POMDP settings. Claiming that these methods are similar enough to a much older approach that was not designed for POMDPs is not reasonable. The paper would be much more informative if it included any comparisons to approaches that were designed for POMDPs, and without this comparison, it is hard to evaluate the importance of SMIRL\u2019s methodological innovation.\n\n### Other smaller comments ###\nAlmost all citations in the paper are incorrectly formatted in the text, making the paper very difficult to read.\n\nAlgorithm 1 is not well formatted. It is not clear from the algorithm box that \u201clearn the reward machine\u201d is actually a comment describing the next few lines of the algorithm, but that is what the text suggests.\n\nThe baselines in the continuous control domain are not defined in the main text of the paper."
