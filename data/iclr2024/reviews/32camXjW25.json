                "value": "This paper proposes a normalization method with class-aware sampling to cope with class imbalance in long-tailed classification. By analyzing covariance matrices of features trained on an imbalanced dataset, the authors find out the issue of long-tailed learning that learnt feature components heavily correlate with each other, degrading rank of feature representation. To mitigate it, the proposed method embeds a whitening module to decorrelate features and applies a sampling strategy based on class distribution toward stable training. In the experiments on long-tailed image classification, the method exhibits competitive performance with the other approaches."

                "value": "### - Sampling technique.\nWhile the whitening is well introduced into long-tailed classification in Secs.3.1-3.3, the sampling strategy (Sec.3.4) is presented in a heuristic manner without providing detailed (theoretical) analysis nor motivation.\n\nIt is unclear why classes are first divided into several groups (in Fig.4). The concept of \"group\" as a superset of classes is introduced in a procedural way, lacking discussion about its effect on sampling.\n\nThen, ad-hoc sampling rule is defined by using lots of hyper-parameters in Eqs.(4,5). What is a key difference from the standard class-balanced sampling? For realizing such a class-aware sampling, it is more straightforward to control the class frequency in sampling between the uniform (class-balanced sampling) and the ratio of class samples (instance-balanced sampling), though it is hard to grasp the purpose of GRBS in this manuscript.\n\nBesides, BET is just a simple technique to control frequency of the GRBS.\nAs shown in Table 4, the GRBS itself degrades performance, while it is improved by BET. Following this direction, class-balanced sampling (CB) could also be improved by applying such an ad-hoc control of sampling frequency.\nPile of these ad-hoc techniques makes the method theoretically unclear.\n\n### - Feature analysis.\nThis paper lacks in-depth analysis about feature co-variance (Fig.2). Qualitative discussion/analysis is required to clarify why such a rank reduction happens in the scenario of class imbalance. SVD results in the bottom row of Fig.2 are less discussed; add more comments on it such as by clarifying what the two axes mean.\nThere are also several works to cope with class imbalance by means of feature co-variance [R1,R2] and normalization [R3][Zhong+21]. The authors should discuss the proposed method in those frameworks for clarifying its novelty.\n\nFig.3 provides a confusing analysis based on trace norm of covariance matrices. The right-hand figure shows that the proposed method increases \"instability\", possibly leading to unfavorable training.\nIt is a confusing result and makes it hard to understand the authors' claim. The trace norm is dependent on the feature scale (magnitude) which is less relevant to instability of training. Thus, it seems not to be a proper metric for measuring the instability in this case; the authors should apply the other metric invariant to feature scales.\n\n### - Experimental results.\nThe performance results in Sec.4 are inferior to SOTAs reported, e.g., in [R3]. For fair comparison to the SOTAs, the method should be embedded into the popular backbone networks, e.g., ResNet-50 for ImageNet-LT and iNat18.\nIt is also valuable to check whether discriminative features of deeper backbones behaves in the similar way to Fig.2 or not.\n\nIn Fig.4 right, it is meaningless to compare training losses among different sampling strategies since even an identical training dataset can be regarded as different ones by varying sampling rules.\n\n\n[R1] Xiaohua Chen et al.

This paper uses the Batch whitening (whitening over the batch dimension, like its specification, batch normalization (standardization) ) [Huang CVPR 2018, Huang CVPR 2020], but it terms as channel whitening. I understand this paper want to address the \u201cchannel\u201d decorrelation, but the method is commonly said as \u201cbatch\u201d whitening (v.s., batch normalization).   \n\n2.I am not confident to the novelty. Indeed, batch whitening is a general module proposed in [Huang CVPR 2018, Huang CVPR 2020], and is also plugged in before the last linear layer to learn decorrelated representation for normal class distribution. I recognize the novelty of this paper using BW for imbalance classification, but overall, the novelty seems not to be significant.  \n\nOther minors:\n\n-It is better to proofreading the paper. E.g., \u201cre-samplingPouyanfar et al\u201d in Page 2, \u201cAditya et al. Menon et al. (2020) propose\u201d in Page 3. \u201cTable ??, \u201d in Page 8. \n\n-I am not sure this paper whether use a correct reference, e.g., \u201c. Cui et al. Cui et al. (2019)\u201d \u201cCao et al. Cao et al. (2019) \u201d \u2026., Besides, There provide too much reference in the first paragraph, and most of words in the first paragraph is the reference.
