The training strategy of the proposed method is similar to Imagic, with the main differences being that the authors employ BLIP to generate a caption describing the input image, and combine the first and second stages in Imagic into one. Besides, authors use DreamBooth as the backbone.\n\n2. I find the location of the point (1-y)e_src + ye_tgt in Figure 2 confusing, and I'm uncertain why the value of y (gamma) exceeds 1 in vector subtraction. Typically, y should fall within the range [0,1] if normalization has been applied. Furthermore, It would be beneficial to include a discussion explaining why projection is more suitable for editing compared to vector subtraction, in terms of identity preservation.\n\n3. The qualitative comparison suggests that the results produced by the proposed method may have lower resolution compared to other methods, as evident in the examples of the dog, bird, and giraffe in Figure 7. I am concerned about the potential impact of the proposed method on image quality, and I notice that there are no evaluation metrics in the paper reflecting image quality, such as Inception Score (IS) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID).\n\n4. It would be beneficial to include a quantitative comparison for the various components employed in the proposed method. Additionally, it's unclear why the authors chose to apply the forgetting strategy only in vector subtraction and not in projection. Further clarification on this decision would be helpful."
