The paper showcases the effectiveness of this new approach by demonstrating its ability to recover the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimate and its favorable performance within the exponential family of distributions. To validate their method, the authors conduct comprehensive empirical tests on both low-dimensional synthetic and real-world datasets, illustrating its efficacy and its superiority over Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE). Additionally, the authors extend the application of their method to Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with energy-based priors, broadening the scope of their contribution in the field of generative models."

                "value": "However, I am not fully convinced by whether the proposed algorithm really works better in practice than original EBM training when modeling complex distributions. This lies in several aspects:\n\n1. From my own experience, the most challenging part when training the EBM is to get valid samples from the current fitted distribution to estimate the (gradient of) normalizing constant. Previous works try to solve this problem with different sampling techniques. While this work proposes a linear lower bound, it still needs to estimate the normalizing constant with Monte Carlo based method. Thus, it might not really alleviate the training difficulties.\n\n2. To do this Monte Carlo estimation, the work employs important sampling using a base distribution $q(x)$ and $q(x)$ are simple distributions like Gaussian. I suspect this algorithm works because the target distributions tested in this work are very simple, either toy distribution or conditional distribution $p_\\theta(y|X)$ where y is low dimensional. If we are modeling model complex distribution like unconditional distribution $p(x)$ on high dimensional data like images, then we still need Monte Carlo based methods and the previous diffculties are still there.\n\n3. The proposed algorithm introduces a variational parameter b, and it requires to update b together with the energy function iteratively. Then similar to the VAE case, whether there can be a mismatch between the estimate of b and the energy function $E_\\theta(X)$.  (Not sure whether the $\\exp^{-b}$ term will make the training more unstable if b is not well optimized.) Or in other words, how diffcult is it to design the schedule of updating b and energy function to make this algorithm work. \n\n4. As also mentioned in 2, the modeled distributions in the experiments are too simple to be convincing to me. The modeled experiments are either unconditional distribution on toy data or with image input but only models the conditional distribution on some low dimensional label. The VAE experiment in 5.3 models binary MNIST (which is also not very complex). And with the help of encoder and decoder, the latent space might be more simple. (Beside, what if we train the model VAE-EBM not with $l_{snl}$ but with plain MLE loss? There seems to be included as a baseline in Table 5.) I think in order to make the proposed algorithm more convincing, the authors need to demonstrate better results than pure MLE loss on more complex distributions like real image (face or cifar or SVHN).\n\n5. The review for EBM study seems to be insuffcient, may consider the following works:\n\n[1] Improved contrastive divergence training of energy-based models.\n\n[2] Learning energy-based models by diffusion recovery likelihood.\n\n[3] A tale of two flows: Cooperative learning of langevin flow and normalizing flow toward energy-based model."
