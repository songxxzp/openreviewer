How would you know if there is an edge between them from the matrices D(A \\cup 0) and M(G;A \\cup 0)?\n\nOther questions:\n* Where in your proof do you need straight non-intersecting edges?\n* Also is this assumption always valid in chemistry? If so could you explain/ give reference?\n* Can you explain in more detail what problem 2.1 is? Is this a problem you solve in this paper?\n* Page 5: what is the `main paper'? There is only one paper. How are these definitions related to the definitions above when you defined \n  IGS and RGS?\n* A paper you could consider adding to your refs:\n[Is Distance Matrix Enough for Geometric Deep Learning? Li et al]\n\n\nLocal remarks and suggestions regarding writing (no need to address in rebuttal):\n* Last paragraph in page 2 is confusing I would rephrase\n* In the past work section: Why do you say Problem 1.1 is much simpler? The explanation gives is that there is an  algorithm with exponential complexity to solve the problem (note also this algorithm has issues when there are eigenvalue multipliciities)\n* There are two  things which seem to me make the presentation unnecessarily too complicated (this is not essential). Firstly, why do you decide to have a (n-1) by (n-1) distance matrix instead of n by n like the rest of the world uses? It makes the notation cumbersume. Secondly, why do you bother to lexicographically sort things when later you will define a permutation invariant distance? You can just store things in an arbitrary order.\n* I think the first paragraph is Section 5 is unnecessarily aggressive. Firstly, I didn't attend Isabelle Guyon's talk but I would guess the remark you are quoting was made half-jestingly. Secondly, experiments on QM9 use the standard train/test paradigm and results are evaluated on the test. This is a reasonable and standard practice. The limitations of this practice regarding generalizing to out of distribution data are also known. Since you are not addressing these issues in the experiments I don't see why you need to bring up the whole issue. Just say what your experiments are. \n* Page 12 just before the beginning of the appendix there is a paragraph which maybe is misplaced?"

                "value": "The paper delves into the representation and comparison of Euclidean graphs using concepts developed for point clouds. These point clouds are often represented by finite sets of unlabeled points, and the most natural equivalence for these point clouds is rigid motion or isometry, which maintains all inter-point distances. \n\nThe paper emphasizes the importance of complete isometry invariants, which are descriptors that can reliably compare Euclidean graphs without ambiguity. The authors propose the first continuous and complete invariant for Euclidean graphs, which is computable in polynomial time based on the number of points.\n\nFurthermore, the paper also touches upon the challenges posed by real data, which is often noisy, and provides implementation details and code for verification."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Following would be some of the central points of discussion :\n\n1) **Scalability \\& Approximation**: While this is a pioneering effort for complete invariance in graphs, to be applicable to a much broader application class the question of scalability is crucial. Graphs typically comprise thousands or millions of nodes. Having a polynomial complexity on the nodes makes it harder to execute. To this end, would the authors think of some approximations that could be possible? or as a reverse question can comment on the impossibility of such a scenario?\n\n2) **Other graph types**: I am assuming the graphs in the paper are undirected and consist of an edge weight of 1. Can the theory developed extend easily to weighted and/or undirected graphs? What would be the challenges in doing so?\n\n3) **Robustness to noise**: This is a minor point, but is there some theoretical result possible on the tolerance to outliers or Gaussian noise levels?"
