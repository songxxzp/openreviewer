On top of identifying the \u201ckey heads\u201d being focused on addition, the paper shows that the same heads are also involved in subtraction. While this might be intuitive, considering that one of these tasks is the opposite of the other, it is not obvious that an LLM would discover and utilize this duality. However, it is unclear whether that is because the heads focus only on numbers or because they are utilising the duality of summation and subtraction.\n4. The paper recognises that later heads depend on earlier ones and attempts to analyse these dependencies (although it appears there are none)."

                "value": "1. The paper identifies attention heads that take part in the processing of summation but does not look into or explain what each of the \u201ckey heads\u201d actually does and what is the mechanism through which it contributes to summation. Therefore, the paper focuses on _localization_ of the heads that partake in summation, rather than _interpreting_ them.\n\n2. The paper does not look at alternative representations of numbers. For example, in words (\u201ctwo\u201d instead of 2), Roman numerals (II instead of 2), and other languages (\u4e8c or \u0662 instead of 2). The lack of such analysis leaves the question open whether these heads simply attend to numerical tokens or whether they are involved in higher-order reasoning about numbers and arithmetic.\n\n3. Related to the above, the paper seems to focus only on single-digit summation. It is unclear whether the results would translate to the summation of larger numbers (or more than two numbers). This is important as prior works have shown that the ability of LLMs to do arithmetic quickly decreases with the increase of the number of digits. It would be interesting to see if your analysis would be able to provide insights into this phenomenon.\n\n4. I am not sure how to read the attention patterns in Fig. 4. How can the attention be negative? In fact, it does not seem that these heads attend to all numbers. The first head seems to attend to the completion of \u201cor\u201d with \u201canges\u201d and the full stop. Both heads seem to attend only to 3 while solving the task would also require attention to 5. Therefore, it is not clear how these heads participate in performing summation.\n\n5. The paper looks predominantly at attention heads. However, it is well known that a lot of the computation and processing happens in the MLPs. Hence, a full picture of the interoperation of the mechanisms for summation should also include the MLPs"

                "value": "1. Does knocking out the heads have effects on other tasks, i.e. are these heads only important for arithmetic or are they polysemantic?\n\n2. In the Introduction, you say _\u201cContrary to expectations that LLMs may involve diverse attention heads across all layers, our findings reveal that only a small percentage (0.5%) of the attention heads significantly impact the model\u2019s performance.\u201d_ However, this is exactly the expectation: attention heads have diverse functions so it is not surprising that only a few of them would be involved in summation.\n\n3. In the Introduction, you say _\u201cRemarkably, only the absence of these heads leads to a notable decline in model performance.\u201d_ But this can\u2019t be true. Surely there are many other weights that, if perturbed, would result in a significant decline in model performance (e.g. the embedding matrix or the final output projection matrix).\n\n4. In Section 4.2, how do you decouple the effect of the individual heads? In the implementation of LLAMA there are no separate $W_O$ for each head but a single one that is applied to the concatenation of all the heads. Therefore, it mixes information across heads. How do you resolve this?\n\n5. In Figure 4 left, how do you know that the effect you see is because of the heads specialising in numbers and not because your test sequences have numbers in them? I\u2019d be curious to see how this plot and the rest of your analysis would look like if applied to sentences which have nothing to do with numbers and arithmetic. Possibly the heads that you have found to be important for arithmetic would be especially unimportant for other tasks."

Through this analysis, they identified the most important attention heads involved in the addition calculations for each model. To confirm the importance of these heads, the researchers ablated them and used counterfactual examples, which showed a clear impact on loss when these heads were removed. Interestingly, only a very small number of attention heads were consistently involved in the addition across all the different question formats. Further examination showed these heads specifically focus on the numerical tokens in the input strings. The researchers replicated some of these findings with one-digit subtraction as well. The paper clearly maps out how a few key attention heads enable simple addition across different state-of-the-art LLMs."
