It appears that algorithm 2 is the method they propose. However, in algorithm 2, there are a lot of hyper-parameters, including $\\eta_k$, $\\gamma_k$, and even $\\alpha_k$. It is not clear to me why Algorithm 2 is \"learning rate-free\". The explanation about the notations in Algorithm 2 should be clearer.\n\nIn section 5.2, authors should report the metrics for their reinforcement learning experiment. It is hard to understand the value of the proposed PS-SPS and PS-DA-SGD from Table 3. Also, the authors mention that they removed all the batch normalization layers in the CIFAR-100 experiment. What are the benefits of such removal?\n\nAuthors should also clearly write their assumptions and conclusions into a formal theorem in Section 4.2."

The authors claim that the adaptive methods can be viewed as applying the steepest descent to parameter-scaled networks based on Eqs 1-4. However, the notations are not clear, what's the formal definition of $f'$, why $f'$ needs to be introduced, and how to leverage it?\n\n3. In Section 3, equation (7) is also confusing, in Adam, $\\alpha$ is also depending on the randomness of the stochastic gradients, when why $E u = \\nabla f(w)/\\alpha^2$ can hold?\n\n4. The reasoning from (9)-(11) is also not clear to me, if you only want to mention that the learning rate should not depend on $\\alpha$, why do you still need equations (10) and (11)?\n\n5. The convergence analysis is also not clear, the authors just provide a very simple proof in the appendix, in the main part, I actually do not see anything that is related to the convergence. Additionally, the proof is also not clear, many notations such as D,G are not clearly presented; the assumption that $\\alpha_k$ coverges to $\\alpha$ is also not presented; Eq.
