Through well-written experiments, the\nauthors show how deep linear networks display critical learning periods. They\nconducted two experiments: one focused on competition in a multi-path model\n(similar to our eyes), and the other focused on the effect of critical periods on transfer\nlearning.\n\nThe first experiment reveals that a deprivation deficit in one pathway will result in the\nother pathway to winning the competition and learning all the corresponding features.\nThe deprivation only has an effect if applied in the early epochs. This reinforces the\ncritical learning period claim. The authors also show, by permanently lesioning the\ndominant pathway, that the deprived pathway isn\u2019t dead and will pick up features that\nthe dominant pathway has missed.\n\nThe second experiment highlights the effect of depth and data distribution on the\nimpact that deprivation during the critical period has. It reveals that deeper networks\nare more sensitive to deprivations in the critical period, and the structure of the data\ndistribution also dictates the impact of the deprivation."

Sure the literal biochemical explanation doesn't hold in an artificial setting, but analogies of this (reduced plasticity) could well occur. I don't think these are 'competing' hypotheses as they are framed; plasticity, imperfect optimization, etc. are *mechanisms* by which critical periods could arise in both artificial and biological systems; it doesn't tell us the reason\u00a0\u00a0(inherent to learning, quirks of substrate, something else, etc.). In the conclusion \"natural information processing constraints\" are contrasted with biochemical processes like plasticity as an alternative hypothesis, but what is (decreased) plasticity buyt a natural information processing constraint? Demonstrating presence in artificial systems doesn't estabilsh it as a general feature of learning, except insofar as we've defined learning narrowly to be done by biological and ANNs (does naive bayes learn? does it exhibit critical periods?). It becomes sort of a circular argument about what does \"learning\" even mean. This commonality is actually supported by your experiments in Fig 3 recreating Guillery's. Anyway, I think the key sentences/claims (e.g. last of the abs) and results stand and are extremely interesting,\u00a0 I would just like to see this framed around mechanisms or instantiations of information processing constraints, or something, rather than competing hypotheses. and maybe acknowledge\u00a0more of the ambiguity of what \"learning systems in general\" means/ (without compromising clarity and narrative, which I believe are strong points of the paper).\n\nTerms used in equations are not explained when introduced\u00a0 in 3.1 -- I know it's from a citation and you might be short on space, but you will lose a lot of readers here and it's a shame not to continue the clear prose you've had thus far.\n\nAround eqn 9, connection of matric completion to what you're trying to do is not clear -- be explicit about how imputing missing values is the same as / allows us to specify\u00a0 task relationships with flexibility.\u00a0\n\nWhile the relationship of experiments to showing dependence on depth is very clear and well-explained, the insights and relationship of experiments to data distribution is much less clear."
