Then authors claim that the ordered clustering can be defined as the distance between sample x and its centroid and two neighbored centroids. Based on these, authors proposed an ordered k-means algorithm for clustering ordered data."

Some basic clustering metrics, such as ACC and NMI, lack comparison. Also this explains why other comparison algorithms achieve poorer performance.\n\n2. We question the value of unsupervised order clustering. The important value of clustering as a classical unsupervised method is that it does not require a tedious data preprocessing process such as labeling data in advance. In contrast, the order clustering proposed by the authors has high requirements for the dataset itself (sequentially), and such requirements are usually obtained by tedious manual sorting, which contradicts the advantages of clustering itself. Can the authors provide a real dataset or scenario where sequential order exists and clustering is required? Note that this is different from the manually ordered dataset used by the authors in the experimental section.\n\n3. Why did you select only two data sets for your different ablation experiments? Did the authors artificially select the datasets to present the ablation experiments? Meanwhile, the parameter \\gamma lacks ablation experiments with relevant parameter descriptions. More experimental results are expected"

Even with relative attributes, it may be difficult to define a total order between categories so an equivalence between pairs of categories is sometimes defined. Partially ordered sets are in general easier to define than total orders. \n\nMoreover, there might exist different ways to define orders between categories. For instance, in ref [A], the orders between face categories might define age, chubbiness, roundness, color, big lips etc... Fortunately, in Fig 1 (c) of the submission, the face images are ordered by age, but another criterion might have been extracted by the method since it is unsupervised, and the reported scores would not have been as good. \n\n[A] Devi Parikh & Kristen Grauman, Relative Attributes, ICCV 2011"
