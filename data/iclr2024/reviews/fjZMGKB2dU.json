                "value": "This paper addresses the challenge of answering logical queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). The authors argue that current approaches are limited in that they focus on monadic anchored tree-shaped queries, characterized by query dependency graphs with a tree structure and constant values as leaf nodes. To address this limitation, the paper claims the following contributions:\n\n(C1) A technique for over-approximating arbitrary monadic CQs as tree-shaped CQs (without anchors). This means that, given a CQ q, the technique would generate a tree shaped q\u2019 that subsumes q (meaning that each answer to q on any dataset is contained in the answer set for q\u2019 on the same dataset) and which is \u201coptimal\u201d in some well-defined way\n\n(C2) A proposal to adapt the method of Zhu et al. for anchored tree-shaped CQs to the unanchored setting\n\nAdditionally, the authors provide empirical results based on established benchmarks related to these tasks."

                "value": "The topic of query answering over incomplete KGs has attracted significant attention in recent years. Hence, this submission is clearly relevant to ICLR. Furthermore, the problem of approximating CQs has also received attention within the database theory and knowledge representation research communities. The paper is also clearly written and the main formal claims in the paper appear correct. The paper does make a contribution to the current state-of-the-art, albeit one that I consider rather modest (for specific elaboration, please see below)."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "As previously mentioned, I find the claimed contribution rather limited. Specifically, Contribution (C1) is not directly related to the field of Machine Learning; the results it claims are strictly within the domain of database theory. Unravelling techniques are conventional in database theory and knowledge representation. Furthermore, the observation that the tree unraveling (to any depth) of a non-tree-shaped conjunctive query results in an over-approximation of the original query might be considered common knowledge within the community. Therefore, as a researcher with main background in database theory, logic, and knowledge representation, I regard the primary findings presented in Section 4.1 as straightforward observations that might not carry sufficient significance for publication.\n\nThe significance of (C1) in the context of the current machine learning-based query answering state-of-the-art is also not evident to me. As the authors have mentioned, existing approaches are unable to handle arbitrary monadic tree-shaped conjunctive queries (CQs) without the requirement of query anchoring. Consequently, most of these approaches cannot directly leverage the proposed approximation. This brings us to Contribution (C2), in which the authors introduce an expansion of Zhu et al.'s method to encompass unanchored queries. This extension is not sufficiently elaborated and it is unclear it what manner it enables the technique by Zhu et al to \"support\" arbitrary tree shaped CQs. Additionally, it is uncertain whether this extension can be applied to other methods, especially those dependent on the existence of embeddings for the anchors.  This doesn't seem straightforward in my view.\n\nI also found the experimental results somewhat perplexing. Specifically, in the comparison between GNN-QE and its extension, \\exists GNN-QE, applied to anchored queries, both systems are trained on distinct datasets; the significance of the reported results remains unclear to me in this context. Adding to the confusion, the experiments appear to include results for queries that may not strictly adhere to conjunctive queries (CQs) and may incorporate other first-order constructs, including negation. To the best of my knowledge, the results presented in the core technical sections of the paper are confined to CQs (and indeed, the seminal result by Chandra and Merlin only applies to CQs)."

                "value": "This paper is trying to apply a technique that works for for the certainty case to reasoning under uncertainty that is inherent in learned models. In particular, it is assuming that the probability of a disjunction is like the maximum probability of its components. Consider the cyclic CQ of Figure 1 (c): as the number of friends of someone goes to infinity, the probability that two of them are coworkers should approach 1. If you wanted a particular x,y and z, what you propose may be more sensible, but not when the query is for just one of them and the others are existentially quantified.\n\nYou need to convince us that the sort of queries you can handle is a useful class. (E.g., the valid path restrictions seems very restrictive.) Can it answer *all* queries on knowledge graphs (including when the knowledge graph has arbitrarily many reified relation)?. E.g., this seems to include many fewer queries than could be made with say Problog, which I don't think has any of the restrictions you embrace.\n\nPage 3 \"y and z are both existentially quantified\" isn't true as it stands. They are universally quantified at the scope of the rule, and existentially quantified in the scope of the body.\n\nI don't understand why \"the number of approximations is infinite\". If we ground a graph out to propositions (by replacing variables with the elements of the population of entities in all ways), the model is still finite. There is exponential explosion, but it's not infinite. This makes me suspicious. Surely, you can check for loops which would make it finite. However I suspect it is exponential in path length, so that is probably moot. Please give us the complexity."

                "value": "What is the mean reciprocal rank of a set? How do you rank sets? If there are multiple witnesses for one x (e.g, multiple instance of y and z for a single x), how do you choose which one if the ground truth? What is the ground truth?\n\nWhat is \"the Spearman correlation rank between the total number of answers....\"? Spearman rank correlation measures differences between ranks. Why is it appropriate for the total number of answers?\n\nThe MRRs for FB15k-237 seem particularly low. The methods don't seem to work. It seems like the modifications that were made to create  FB15k-237 from  FB15k are exactly what your are exploiting. The Spearman rank correlation seems particularly high. Can you explain these results?"
