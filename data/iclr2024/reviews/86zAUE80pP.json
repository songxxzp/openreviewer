The weighting strategy can be implemented in a heuristic way or a learnable way through the Lagrange function. As a result, in the continual learning setting, the policy (Language model) can seek a good trade-off between new task performance and old knowledge retention. The experiments show that the method outperforms all baselines and is close to the ChatGPT in terms of several metrics such as reference preference model score."

                "value": "- The continual RL problem solved by this paper is never really formulated. Equation 4 is proposed as an objective, but it is never made clear what problem it solves. This makes it feel a bit arbitrary to me. For example, see recent work proposing formal definitions of the problem [1], [2]. \n- In general I find section 3 prior to section 3.2.1 to be very hard to follow. A number of things are referred to as theoretically justified or derived, but as far as I can tell this is not true in any meaningful sense. I think I would be much more open to the positioning of the contribution if the authors just started with the desiderata of section 3.2.1 and explained the reason for each intuitively maybe with the aid of a little bit of math for each one (something that is currently lacking in my view). The paper could be better positioned in my view more as an exploration of the impact of these various intuitions and their impact on continual RLHF. This is because, in my mind, the current discourse does not really deliver on proposing this technique as a theoretically justified approach for RL. \n- Improvements in Table 6, Fig 5, and Table 8 seem to be there but it is not clear how significant these are or exactly why this would generalize across domains. I didn\u2019t notice any analysis of statistical significance, which is odd because PPO (and most RL methods) are known to have high run to run variance in general, so it is very hard to take RL results seriously without this. \n\nBecause I worry about statistical significance and generality of the results and don't believe the formulation is well justified as presented, I lean towards rejection at this time. \n\n[1] Khetarpal, Khimya, et al. \"Towards continual reinforcement learning: A review and perspectives.\" Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 75 (2022): 1401-1476.\n\n[2] Kumar, Saurabh, et al. \"Continual learning as computationally constrained reinforcement learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.04345 (2023).\n\nDetailed Comments on Equation 5:\n\nA particular issue with the start of section 3 is with equation 5 and the discussion around it. What do you mean when you say \u201cBy introducing the actor-critic version, the clipped ratio, and the entropy bonus, we claim that Eq.(4) can be improved to (the derivation is detailed in Appendix Section B)\u201d? What does \"improved\" mean in this context? Also going through Appendix Section B, it seems apparent to me that this is not a derivation of any particular theory/lemma/proposition or fact, rather it is just a series of steps that are not explained in the main text. For example, the authors mention improvement when they say: \u201cIn the PPO method, the objective is to maximize the expectation of the advantage function instead of the reward value. Hence, we improve the above objective as\u201d -- here the \"improvement\" is either empirical or related to the theory about bias/variance. It is mentioned again when they say: \u201cwe introduce the knowledge retention penalty instead of the true KL divergence, we discuss the reason in lines 134-137 in our paper. Here, the above objective is improved as:\u201d  -- here the improvement is based on the authors own empirical observations and computational justification. The authors also write \"Then we introduce the importance sampling like PPO, the above objective can be written as\" -- importance sampling is a deep theoretical topic related to off-policy optimization while having issues related to variance to implement in practice. I find the analysis of and flippant discussion of this component of the algorithm to be entirely inadequate in the appendix. It is also not even discussed in the main text."

The key difference with generic RLHF seems to be that the optimization of the two terms is only over a subset of the data in equation 4. Why does it help us to essentially throw away data? Or is this motivated as part of a computational constraint from some implicitly considered problem formulation that is not spelled out? \n4. The hard cutoff based on hyperparameter k seems a bit weird to me. Towards what metric would the hyperparameter k be optimized for if it can't be equation 4 itself? This gets even weirder for me when the hard cutoff is then relaxed in equation 6. I don't get why it was ever introduced to begin with. \n5. Why does equation 6 make equation 5 easier to optimize? I buy that equation 6 is more general than equation 5, but this is the key motivation for this sense and it is really not clear to me why this would be the case. Especially considering that focusing on only a subset of the data would require less computation, which I presume is a major constraint of the implicit problem formulation."

The values of \\alpha and \\beta are adjusted by collecting roll-out samples and classifying them into 5 categories, normal, high performing, ... noise.
