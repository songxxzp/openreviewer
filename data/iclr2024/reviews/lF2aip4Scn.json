In fact, under this choice [1] proves in their Theorem 5 that it is possible to recover an $\\epsilon$-suboptimal policy compared to the expert with behavioural cloning.\n\n3) Corollary 3 requires the expert to be $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$ optimal but I would expect that, given the reward knowledge, it should be possible to prove a sample complexity bound without the assumption on the $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$ optimality of the expert.\nTo see this think to the case of any BPI algorithm which requires no expert at all to learn an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy.\n\n4) I think that Lemma 11 should be referred as the standard performance difference lemma.\n\n5) Just before Corollary 3, it is said  that \"UCBVI-Ent+ algorithm for regularized BPI. It is a modification of the algorithm UCBVI-Ent by\nTiapkin et al. (2023) with improvement sample complexity\". However, it is not explained which is the crucial difference between the two algorithms. In particular, also the settings are different because UCBVI-Ent+ uses reward information while UCBVI-Ent can be used only for maximum entropy exploration and not to solve Regularized MDPs but this difference is not explained in the main text.\n\n\n[1] ( Rajamaran et al., 2021 ) On the Value of Interaction and Function Approximation in Imitation Learning."

Then during the online interaction with the underlying environment, the learner penalizes deviation of the learned policy from the one learned in the behavioral cloning phase. The paper provided a theoretical analysis of these two phases. For behavioral cloning, the authors show that the KL divergence between the learned policy and the expert policy decreases linearly as the number of demonstrations grows. This holds for both tabular MDPs and linear MDPs under certain assumptions. Then based on this result, the authors further studied the regularized online learning scenario and the RLHF setting. In both cases, the authors are able to prove a fast convergence rate for the proposed algorithms."

This is a nice and great result. Based on that, the authors further performed analysis on their proposed demonstration-regularized RL algorithms and the RLHF algorithms, and both achieved surprisingly fast convergence rates. Overall, the paper has made significant technical contributions.\n\n(2) The paper studied a very novel, interesting, yet challenging problem.
