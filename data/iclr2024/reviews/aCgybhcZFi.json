The paper is written well as a descriptive or narration but omits details about how a pretrained model can be controlled \"The tuned low-rank matrices can serve as controllers, which can be merged into the model weights.\"\n\n\n- Inappropriate manuscript style for ICLR: The conference manuscript is written in a style more suited for a journal publication rather than for ICLR. Most of the implementation details, results and network analysis are missing in the 9 pages and are left to the supplementary material. While the motivation of the manuscript is relevant, the manuscript is not informative enough as an ICLR proceeding. \n\n- Minor: Figure 1 is unclear to describe the difference between the bottom-up (mechanistic) vs top-down (normative) approaches of explaining model computation. The classification of top-down as normative vs bottom up as mechanistic from computational neuroscience [1] seems to be in contradiction with the terminology used in the paper? \n\n\n[1] Levenstein, D., Alvarez, V.

                "value": "1. The paper's overall structure and order contribute to its poor readability. The content would benefit from a better balance between technical formality, such as formal definitions or problem formulation, and more intuitive explanations. Currently, the paper leans too heavily on motivations and visualizations.\n\n* Specifically, Figure 2 takes up excessive space with repetitive examples. Moreover, the detailed methodology such as reading and controlling process is relegated to supplementary materials accessible through multiple layers of links. This makes it difficult to access and potentially hinders a reader's ability to gain a comprehensive understanding of the content. I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of key concepts, such as reading vectors, controlling vectors and objective of reading and controlling process, both in a technical manner and in a more general, high-level way.\n\n2. The paper's contributions are not clearly articulated. The Related Works section lacks a comprehensive technical comparison with prior works, making it difficult to distinguish the paper's unique contributions. I recommend that the authors clearly differentiate their work from existing approaches, particularly in terms of their methodology for reading neural networks' internal representations and controlling neural networks' outputs.\n\n3. While the practical benefits of the proposed method are evident, the paper overlooks limitations of the approach. For instance, such as the general disadvantages of a \"white-box\" approach, such as the need for full accessibility to the LLM's, and the cost of collecting stimulus sets or generating contrastive examples, should be explicitly acknowledged. This limitation is particularly important given that the comparison is conducted against in-context, inference-only LLMs."

Additional related works that also involve research on editing the internal representations or weights of neural networks include [1] and [2]. I hope the authors can explain why these methods were not considered for use in RepE.\n* [1] Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT.\n* [2] Inspecting and Editing Knowledge Representations in Language Models.\n\n4. As mentioned in the Weakness section, I request a more detailed explanation and justification from the authors regarding the potential drawbacks of RepE compared to in-context learning (few-shots) methods. In particular, with reference to Figure 3, I question whether the performance gain over five datasets is significant, especially considering the assumption of accessibility to large language models (LLMs)."
