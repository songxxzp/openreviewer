                "value": "In this study, the authors discuss boosting performance of knowledge distillation without use of ground-truth labels. Knowledge distillation usually uses combinations of human annotations and features/embeddings extracted from teacher models, but this study discusses knowledge distillation in an unsupervised setting and introduces cosine similarity and space similarity (CoSS) training objective to help student models learn to mimic teacher models' embedding structure. The proposed approach is numerically assessed mainly for ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-b0 in image classification tasks and image/video instance segmentation tasks. The evaluation also involves GPU memory requirement per method, and the result seems comparable to that of SEED baseline. Based on those results, the authors confirm the improvements by the proposed approach in many scenarios (models x methods x tasks) in efficient manners."

There are not many existing studies that discuss knowledge distillation in a pure unsupervised learning setting for target tasks.\n\nThe strongest point of this paper may be a lot of experiments the authors conducted such as multiple image classification tasks and image/video object segmentation tasks. Even though each of the experiments is not well described (e.g., lacking justification of baselines and hyperparameter tuning for those methods), the reviewer wants to recognize the attempt to show how the proposed method generalizes.\n\nThis study provides not only quantitative assessments but qualitative assessments e.g., Figs. 3 - 5. While Figs. 4 and 5 seem not much inconclusive, specifically with respect to BINGO+, the provided examples helped the reviewer see the representations learned with CoSS is more similar to that of teacher than SEED."

Appendix A.1 is not detailed enough (how teacher model is trained, architectures of additional trainable layers, baseline hyperparameters, etc) and does not cover all the experiments (at least) in the main body.\n\n\nThis paper also lacks clarity and needs improvement in writing.\n- The reviewer needs more clarifications in the description of the additional evaluation with kNN as it's not convincing. While Section 5.1 explains it is because the approach allows them to evaluate the methods directly without the need of tuning parameters, it is still dependent on the choice of $k$, which is not justified but heuristic.\n- In Section 1, the reduction of GPU memory requirement is emphasized, but the GPU memory requirement is not defined in this paper. How was it measured? If the teacher's embeddings are pre-computed and cached, it maybe easily save GPU memory usage as much as the proposed method does.\n- There are many typos and grammatical errors:\n  - \"distilled student\" should be replaced with \"trained student\", as (knowledge of) teachers are distilled into students, and students are not distilled\n  - and Attention transfer -> and attention transfer\n  - \"(i) feature queues (ii) contrastive objectives (iii) heavy augmentations (iv) and custom batch composition\" -> \"(i) feature queues, (ii) contrastive objectives, (iii) heavy augmentations, and (iv) custom batch composition\"\n  - Some notations are not defined where used. e.g., $\\widehat{A_t^T}$ and $\\widehat{A_s^T}$ in Eq.

Such a conclusion **assumes** that the unsupervised learning methods learn a low dimensional manifold and the manifold is locally euclidean. However, there is a lack of references or theoretical analysis to support their point.\n2. The designed loss is analogous to contrastive learning, which computes the cosine similarity between two normalized feature.

                "value": "This paper tackles self-supervised distillation, specifically targeting the challenge of existing methods requiring extensive sample queues. To address this, the authors have innovatively introduced a loss based on dimension-specific spatial similarity. The novel CoSS supervision framework is composed of conventional sample-based similarities in conjunction with space similarities, thereby effectively emulating the semantic and structural attributes of the data manifold as captured by teacher models. Many experimental validations demonstrate that CoSS not only achieves performance on par with existing methods but also with enhanced efficiency."

            "strengths": {
                "value": "1. The math formulation of the proposed space similarity is elegantly concise, suggesting an inherent capability to capture and learn the manifold's structure effectively.\n\n2. The diversity of experimental settings presented allows readers to gain a thorough understanding of the proposed CoSS loss's capabilities and performance.\n\n3. The organization of this paper benefits from a clear and logical progression that facilitates comprehension of the material presented."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The Methods section could be enhanced by incorporating a simplified example or illustrative figure to show the concept of space similarity.\n\n2. The discussion on topological spaces in Section 4 is commendable. However, It should be noted that L2 normalization in previous approaches is designed to conform the semantic manifold to a hyperspherical space, thereby constraining the metric within the bounds of the cosine similarity. That means the manifold of teacher feature space is already a cosine space and the similarity is determined by the inner product between two hyper-sphere spaces. In light of this, the paper would benefit from a rigorous comparison demonstrating the superiority, if any, of a d-dimensional Euclidean manifold over a d-dimensional hypersphere for the learning tasks at hand."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. This paper could be strengthened by investigating the connection between batch normalization and the proposed CoSS. Can the authors provide insights or very simple results about how BN might influence or interact with CoSS?\n\n2. In my view, to some degree, the joint constraint in CoSS appears to share conceptual relations with the optimal transport (Sinkhorn function). Could the authors elaborate on any theoretical underpinnings or empirical evidence that supports this connection?"
