This paper proposes an alternative estimator based on kernel smoothing to also achieve the minimax lower bound. In the \u201chard cases\u201d where the nuisances are non-smooth, relatively few estimators have been shown to have good properties; for the \u201ceasy cases\u201d where the nuisances are collectively smooth enough, this is a very mature literature."

Therefore, I could not assess this study well. If possible, I want to deepen my understanding and clarify the contributions of this study through an interaction with the authors.\n\nThe reasons why I could not understand the contributions are based on the following three points.\n\n1. Necessity of the exact estimation of the propensity score.\nIn the 2000s, there were enormous arguments about what kind of weighting functions are effective in ATE estimation. As a result of long arguments, researchers found that using the **true** propensity score does not achieve the asymptotic lower bound proposed by Hahn (1998). That is, some finite-sample bias improves the asymptotic efficiency of estimators, as shown by Hirano et al. (2003). Does this study lie in those literature or completely discuss different topics?\n\n2. Significance of the use of a kerne-based U-statistics.\nTo the best of my knowledge, existing studies such as Hirano et al. (2003) employ kernel-based U-statistics, at least in theoretical analysis. What is the difference from the existing approaches?\n\n3. Minimax rate.\nI could not understand why the authors use the minimax optimality for nonparametric estimators. The estimator used by the authors is typically referred to as a semiparametric estimator, which is characterized by nonparametric and parametric estimators. Then, the authors are interested in the estimator error of the parametric part of the semiparametric estimator. Therefore, I believe that the nonparametric minimax optimal rate is a bit meaningless in this context (in other words, I think that although the authors say that the proposed estimator is nonparametric, the estimator is (semi)parametric). Furthermore, the asymptotic variance in Corollary 1 is not efficient from the viewpoint of the semiparametric efficiency bound proposed by Hahn (1998). Is the estimator really efficient or minimax optimal?\n\nAdditionally, I could not understand connections to existing estimators whose asymptotic variance aligns with the semiparametric efficiency bound; that is, the authors' estimator cannot be more efficient than the existing efficient estimators. Overall, I could not understand the author's intent in this study.\n\nMy assessment may be biased my knowledge of existing literature of this topic, and I am not confident on my assessment. I hope that I can deepen the understanding via communication with the authors."
