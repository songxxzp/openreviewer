Considering equations 1 and 2 this approach will be able to capture different activity patterns for users and items, such as popular vs unpopular items but it will not capture which of the popular/unpopular items a given user prefers. This is further validated by tables 2 and 3 where the performance of QRec is essentially identical to MostPop. So in essence I think the percentile embeddings are just capturing fine grained popularity statistics. Given these results I think this approach is of limited utility and needs further development."

However, this assumption may not be true, for example, it is quite possible that a user likes popular items on the movie domain but likes niche items on the music or product domain. To set up a persuading motivation for the proposed method, it is important to at least provide case studies using real-world datasets to test if or not this assumption holds, under what condition does it hold, and by what degree it holds.\n\n- Problem definition 1 and 2 claims \"without training the scoring function on M' or M*\". However, the proposed method is still constructing a scoring function based on M' and M*, using hand-craft statistical functions instead of learned function, but no matter the function is hand-crafted or learned, it needs to use the information in M' and M* for prediction, and thus there really is no fundamental difference, the only difference is wether the function is hand-crafted or machine-learned. It would be better if the paper further clarifies the problem definition.\n\n- Baseline methods are too old and weak, and did not include any of the other pre-trained models for recommendation, such as pre-trained language model based recommendation methods. Given that the proposed method aims at pre-trained recommendation models, it's important and necessary to compare with other existing pre-trained recommendation methods such as pre-trained language models for recommendation.\n\n- Many of the conclusions derived in the experimentation section is based on the ACU metric. However, AUC is not a realistic evaluation metric for recommendation tasks. It would be better to derive the conclusions based on other more realistic metrics such as Hit Ratio and NDCG."
