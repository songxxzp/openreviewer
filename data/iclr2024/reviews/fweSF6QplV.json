The authors need to explain what unique aspects of their framework set it apart from these previous studies. Further elaboration is required in Section 2 to clarify how this work advances the field beyond the current state-of-the-art. This clarification will not only strengthen the paper but also assist readers in understanding the novel contributions made by the authors.\n\n2.

The reviewer notes that the submission lacks a clear exposition of its novel contributions, especially when contrasted with prior works such as those by Manoj Kumar (JMLR, 2023) and Sandeep Kumar (JMLR, 2020). Could the authors specifically articulate the unique and novel aspects of their approach that advance the state-of-the-art in graph coarsening?\n\n2. While applying convex optimization methods to graph coarsening is theoretically appealing, concerns arise regarding scalability, as time complexity may increase quadratically with the number of nodes. This appears to conflict with the primary objective of graph coarsening, which is to reduce computational load. Can the authors address the apparent contradiction and clarify how their algorithms maintain or improve upon the time complexity compared to existing graph coarsening methods?\n\n3. The datasets employed in validating the proposed technique are relatively small-scale. For a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's efficacy, would the authors consider applying their approach to larger-scale graphs where the benefits of coarsening could be more pronounced and the technique's scalability and effectiveness more rigorously assessed?"
