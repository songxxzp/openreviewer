The problem of memorisation in diffusion models was already noticed in several works (as mentioned in the related works section). The observation that in the theoretical optimum of diffusion models they can only replicate training data is new, but it is quite expected since the simplified training objective of DDPMs [Ho et al. 2020] is to directly denoise all training examples with a simple MSE loss.\nThe main contribution of this work is therefore, a set of experiments that measure the memorization across different model sizes, widths, dataset sizes etc. Except for one experiment described in the strengths sections the results are rather intuitive and expected (e.g. diffusion models memorize more examples from smaller datasets, or when trained with wider models), and are presented in a form of report without in-depth analysis of the root-causes of memorization. The interesting hypothesis is proposed only for the analysis of the class conditioning influence, but it is denied right away in the next paragraph.\n- The memorization is only studied with respect to the direct pixel-by-pixel comparison of training and generated samples. Some works (e.g. Carlini et al. mentioned in this work) show that diffusion models can also memorize by generating simple interpolations between similar training examples.\n- The evaluation is performed using only one dataset (CIFAR10). It would be interesting how diffusion models memorize more detailed dataset e.g CelebA."

The results regarding resolution of dataset, data diversity and model size are interesting. The results confirms the expected monotonic behavior, showing that diffusion models memorize samples more when data dimension and data diversity is small, and model size is large. \n4. The results regarding the impact of time embedding are also quite surprising. It would be interesting to analyze this further, and understand why random Fourier features impact memorization in DDPM++."

I also expected to see at least a few of these analysis, on another simple  dataset such as SVHN or CIFAR-100. \n3. The results don't discuss other relevant metrics, such as quality of generations or loss convergence. For example, high weight decay in this work is shown to have a large effect on memorization but it isn't discussed how much it comes at the cost of quality of generations.\n4.  Several results presented in this paper, especially regarding dataset and model complexity are generally expected based on previous work on other generative and discriminative models [1, 2]. \n\n[1] Feng, Qianli, et al. \"When do gans replicate? on the choice of dataset size.\"\u00a0_Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision_. 2021.\n[2] Zhang, Chiyuan, et al. \"Understanding deep learning (still) requires rethinking generalization.\"\u00a0_Communications of the ACM_\u00a064.3 (2021): 107-115.\n[3] Somepalli, Gowthami, et al. \"Diffusion art or digital forgery? investigating data replication in diffusion models.\"\u00a0_Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition_. 2023.\n[4] Somepalli, Gowthami, et al. \"Understanding and Mitigating Copying in Diffusion Models.\"\u00a0_arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.20086_\u00a0(2023).\n[5] Carlini, Nicolas, et al. \"Extracting training data from diffusion models.\"\u00a0_32nd USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 23)_. 2023."

The top and worst matches obtained as a result of using this criterion and its drawbacks should be discussed further. Are the results the same, if the memorization criteria is changed? For example, Somepalli et al [1] used SSCD for memorization.\n2. Results regarding weight decay and EMA aren't very informative. Is the model convergence much worse when weight decay is set high? I would suggest discussing this in more detail.\n3. It would be interesting to show how noise schedule in diffusion models impacts memorization? \n\nThings that impact clarity, but didn't affect score -\n\n1. Skip connection results figures could be better, Figure 4a & 4c some markers are too close to understand. The main observation while comes out clearly, the results about number of skip connections is hard to parse from the figure.\n2. The memorization criterion can be easily explained in words.

                "value": "In this work, the authors present a detailed study on memorization in diffusion models by investigating various factors that may be responsible for increased memorization of training samples. In particular, the authors vary the amount of data in the training set, the time that the model was trained for, the size and the configuration of the model, and the existence of various types of embeddings in the model, and analyze their respective impacts on memorization. The study provides a deep investigation on small-scale data sets like CIFAR-10, and discusses unconditional versus conditional generation."

                "value": "1. First, the paper is very well structured with strong motivation for why memorization is natural in diffusion models, and then going on to present preliminary results on how, on small datasets, diffusion models tend to memorize. \n2. Second, the study is very comprehensive in terms of the breadth of the factors that the authors assess that could lead to memorization. In particular, I enjoyed the section on data distribution, which discusses data dimensionality and diversity with two different formulations. I enjoyed reading these two formulations because these are facets of memorization that are seldom discussed, and most prior work typically only discusses factors like model size and data size. \n3. Third, the paper is very thorough in the effects of embedding, and in particular, the finding that using Fourier embeddings versus positional embeddings can cause a significant change in memorization was surprising. \n4. Fourth, the work acts as a great guide for practitioners who might want to understand the effect of memorization and will be useful for future research."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. First, the analysis of memorization is done in complete isolation of the model's generalization or analysis of aspects of image generation or image quality such as inception score or pressure distance. And I do not think that any analysis on memorization can purely happen in the absence of the latter because we might end up analyzing models that do not make any sense for practitioners. \n2. Second, the experiments are performed on very small datasets and it is unclear how these findings actually take shape in real scenarios where you have huge datasets and you are training on millions of samples with almost similarly sized models. \n3. Third, I don't think that the authors should perform a set of experiments where they try to fine-tune a stable diffusion model on a small dataset which may still be a reasonable analysis where people might want to use a custom stable diffusion model on a particular style by further fine-tuning it on a certain type of data. However, the setting that the authors discuss while it is very helpful in creating the analysis that they do is also very, very restrictive and does not generalize to realistic settings that practitioners actually care for. And I would encourage the authors to explore that. \n4. Fourth, a lot of the paper is about showcasing a finding but does not actually explain the reasons for why a finding actually makes sense. For instance, in particular, the section on the type of embedding was rather weak in my opinion in terms of explaining the effect. Similarly, the section on why data diversity does not influence memorization so much was pretty weak and this paper can significantly be strengthened if the authors actually discuss the results in more detail and why they should happen in a particular way. And I would say that this is true for most of the sections where currently this paper reads as a reporting of a result rather than a scientific discussion of a phenomenon."
