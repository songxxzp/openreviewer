The authors derive a weak-sense stochastic continuous time limit approximation of the discrete dropout algorithm and use this modified ODE to explain the phenomenon of dropout. This SDE is driven by a deterministic modified loss (due to dropout) and a stochastic Brownian motion with a covariance vector that also depends on the dropout parameter. The authors derive their conclusion from the similarity between the strcuture of the Hessian and the stochastic noise covariance matrix which could aid in getting flatter minimas as sharper directions would have more stochastic noise (due to similarity between Hessian structure and covariance matrix)."

It seems clear from the appendix. Better to refer it to the appendix or provide a statement on how it was derived. \n\n2) It's not evident how the authors get equation 8 from section 4.1. I missed the part where the stochasticity V comes into the picture from section 4.1. From Theorem-1, it is not clear, what effect dropout is having as the author's do not clearly mention the source of stochasticity. \nIt is well known a stochastic discrete algorithm can be well approximated by Euler-Maruyama discretization of an SDE, but in the manuscript the connection/derivation is not clear. \n\nNow here are some technical concerns I had:\n\n3) The role of the modified loss $L_{S}$ from the SDE is not clear in terms of generalization. Authors only use the flatness argument from the Hessian-covaraince alignment, but the deterministic part driving the SDE seems to not play any role ?\n\n5) It's not quite clear how the Hessian alignment with the covariance matrix is aiding to flatter minimas. Does the eigenvector directions of the covariance matrix also correspond exactly as that of the Hessian? Given, the equations in 5.2, it is not clear how the structure of the Hessian and the Cov matrix are the same. The coefficients (involving $e_{i}$) seem to suggest that the alignment may not be same. Infact near convegence, $l_{i,2}$ tends to 0, making the second term in the covariance term vanish. \n\n6) How the effect of dropout is in aiding to flat minima correspond to that of SGD and parameter noise injection. In some sense, dropout has some correspondace to both. Parametrer noise injection is well known as the explicit hessian regularizer (more explicitly on the trace of the hessian https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04613). In my opinion, a comparison between SGD, parameter noise-injection and dropout are critical. \n\nminor: \n\n4) Which SME is used in the experiments?

Everything within the paper is well executed (up to some minor comments addressed in questions), but the main result seems to be writing down the modified loss and SDE. The results about the alignment of the Hessian and dropout noise seem somewhat incomplete; I have given suggestions for improving those analyses as well.\n\nIn particular I wonder if the conclusions will generalize to the case of deeper networks, or if the qualitative picture changes, both in terms of the modified version of the loss, and the Hessian alignment. A related question is whether or not the results hold for the larger learning rates which are common in practical ML settings, and in the SGD+dropout setting. Even additional numerical evidence would be sufficient here in my opinion. Perhaps focusing experiments more on sweeps over $\\epsilon$ and $p$ can improve this.\n\nSome of the figures can also use improvement; see \"Questions\" for more detailed comments.\n\nI'm looking forward to comments from the authors on these points and am open to changing my review score if they are sufficiently addressed.\n\nUpdate: after author responses, many of the weaknesses were addressed and I have updated my review score."

Is there evidence that the same structure should remain?\n\nThe theorems in the paper rely on small learning rate; however, typically neural networks are trained with large stepsizes (which are far from gradient flow for example). Which aspects of the theory will hold at larger learning rates?\n\nFigure one and its related experiments could use improvement. For one, it would be better to plot e.g. panel 2 as a 2-D heatmap versus $\\epsilon$ and $p$, so one can understand the effects of varying each (and any interaction that occurs). Additionally, I think its important to probe some smaller $p$ values (1e-2, 1e-1 perhaps) as the effects of dropout get more interesting with sparser activations.\n\nFor Figure 2, it is better to label each panel by the parameters directly rather than (setting 1, setting 2).\n\nFor the discussion of matrix alignment, it is worth pointing out that random PSD matrices have non-trivial correlation even in high dimensions. In particular, for random PSD matrices the alignment is related to the average eigenvalue. Therefore the statement\n\n```\nIt is noteworthy that the cosine similarity between two random matrices of the same dimensions is highly improbable to exceed the threshold of 0.001.\n```\n\nis not the right one. It would be helpful to add a comparison to the plots of the covariance of two matrices with random eigenvectors, but the same eigenvalues as each of the relevant matrices. This will provide a better null model.\n\nI would suggest finding a different notation for the stepsize (currently $\\epsilon$). This will bring the notation more in line with what practitioners use, which I think will help the paper find a broader audience.\n\nAs a minor point: this line in the abstract:\n\n```\nThese dual facets of our research, encompassing both theoretical derivations and empirical observations, collectively constitute a substantial contribution towards a deeper understanding of the inherent tendency of dropout to locate flatter minima.\n```\n\ndoesn't really add anything for the reader - the content of the paper is what will convince me if the contribution is substantial or not!"
