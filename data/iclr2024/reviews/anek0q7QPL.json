                "value": "1. I found the theory to be a weak.  For me to believe the relevance of this theory, it must operate within a multivariate context.  The question is about whether the top eigenvalues of either of these matrices contain the relevant signal. Theory operating on unidimensional data I think has relatively little to offer on this topic. \n\n2. As I read the paper, the authors talk about *the* Hessian matrix.  However, the paper is about a Hessian estimated using a specific deep net, which is of course *a* Hessian, but not *the* Hessian.  The discussion implied (to me) much more general claims than were warranted, imho, given the actual theoretical and empirical results. I would have expected a specific mention of Fisher's Information Matrix, which is closely related to the Hessian, as it includes it, and is a known bound of the variance for any random variable.\n\n3. LDA is well known to find the projection that balances maximizing across-variance while minimizing within-variance.  It was never clear to me why we would want another method to do something like that?  What is missing in LDA that this method achieves? I can imagine a desire to embed in multiple dimensions, rather than just 1, but see my next point about that.\n\n4.  Under the Gaussian model, the direction that captures the variance across classes is simply the difference of means vector (after 'whitening'), and the direction that maximizes the variance within is the class-centered covariance.  Reduced Rank LDA essentially combines those two: it projects the data onto the matrix which is the product of the difference of means with the low-rank estimate of the pooled covariance.  So, we already have a standard/classical approach to embedding into these two dimensions.  How is your approach better than this?\n\n5. The defined Hessian is closely related to another standard thing called the Pointwise Mutual Information (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information), which is very commonly used in language processing and embedding.  A discussion/comparison with this method would be desirable.\n\n6. The numerical results indicate that embedding using the proposed approach is slightly better than the unsupervised approaches, or LDA, which is purely linear.  But your approach is nonlinear.  So, unless the data are strongly linear, a supervised nonlinear approach is likely to win.  And your proposed approach must lose in simulations where the data truly are linear. I'd think any reasonable kernel LDA approach would improve relative to PCA or LDA, assuming a large enough sample size."
