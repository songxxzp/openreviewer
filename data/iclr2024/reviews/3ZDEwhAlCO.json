                "value": "Authors propose a novel convolutional architecture for processing volumetric data, based on an orientation invariant convolution operation. The authors give a sound introduction to equivariant/invariant convolutions. The authors propose a method where convolutional kernels are constructed using spherical harmonics, which are subsequently applied to the input signal to obtain orientational feature fields expressed in a basis of circular harmonics. The signal is mapped back to a position-orientation scalar feature map, after which the authors then apply (soft-)max pooling over the orientation axis to map back to the original 3D domain. Authors show results on two datasets of 3D data, very clearly showing a significant reduction in the number of trainable parameters compared to baseline methods."

The authors are very thorough in their literature review, and include references and explanation of a lot of relevant equivariant/invariant approaches to convolutions in multiple domains. However, I\u2019m not sure where this method fits in. What are the specific challenges with previous works in invariant/equivariant convolutions applied to 3D data that this method is proposing to alleviate? And how does it compare to previous works using spherical harmonics (e.g. [1, 2, 3]). You mention the need for avoiding a summation over the rotation axis, but I\u2019m not sure where this follows from. Could you expand on this? \n\nFrom what I gather your work seems like application of convolutions based on spherical harmonics followed by orientational pooling. Neither of these concepts are novel, nor is their combination.  Where is your contribution exactly, and what is its motivation? It seems this approach is severly limiting in the spatial composition of orientational patterns it is able to express, since architectures invariant to rotation are provably less expressive than equivariant architectures (e.g. see fig 1 in [4])\n\nSecond, the experiments are somewhat limited. Authors show results only on two datasets, neither of which is very widely carried in the field of learning on 3D data. I would be interested to see performance of your approach on larger-scale data, e.g. non-aligned ShapeNet, ModelNet, QM9.\n\n[1] Thomas, N., Smidt, T., Kearnes, S., Yang, L., Li, L., Kohlhoff, K., & Riley, P.
