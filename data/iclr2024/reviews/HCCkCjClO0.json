For example, the authors state that they are trying to address catastrophic forgetting. The forgetting issue is extensively studied in existing works. The abstract should state what are the limitations that exist in CL literature. Then, this paper should state how their proposed method addresses this specific problem.  Second, the motivation of introducing Online Weight Approximation (OWA) to continual learning is unclear. After reading the paper, it is unclear how OWA addresses the forgetting issue. Third, in the related work section, not only related works should be presented, but also their limitations and relation of the proposed OWA with existing methods should be clearly presented. Lastly, the method description should be clearly connected with continual learning. \n\n\n* Lack of insight into how the proposed OWA mitigates forgetting. It would be better to provide more insights and illustrations of OWA and the connection with catastrophic forgetting. \n\n\n* It is unclear the advantage of the proposed method compared to other related methods. In the introduction and the method sections, the paper should state the advantages of the proposed method compared to others. This would make the positions of the paper more clear.   \n\n\n* The compared baselines are too weak. OWA is only compared to a simple replay method. More recent memory-replay methods should be compared. For example, [1, 2] should be compared.\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\n\n[1]  Dark Experience for General Continual Learning: a Strong, Simple Baseline.

The proposed uses $O(n^{2})$ training time for each parameter of the model, which seems quite large, considering the number of parameters present in a typical deep neural network. Therefore, I believe it is necessary to compare the time required to train the proposed method with the other baselines.\n\n2. Empirical evaluation does not include large deep neural networks. For CIFAR10 experiment, authors have used ResNet-10, however, it is not that deep. I suggest the authors to use deeper neural networks, like ResNet-34/50, Vgg-16/19, WideResNet.\n\n3. Additionally, the datasets used for empirical evaluation is not large scale dataset. I suggest the authors to experiment with ImageNet-1k. If it is not possible due to limited resources, then try to evaluate on ImageNet-100.\n\n4. I also think that it is not fair to reduce the number of replay samples of a rehearsal based methods such as Experience Replay, as you are model (parameters) is using very limited memory. This type of comparison is unfair to a rehearsal based methods. In that case, I would suggest the authors to not to use any memory at all and simply compare with regularization based methods such as EWC[1], MAS[2] etc.\n\n5.
