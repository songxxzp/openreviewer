                "value": "The paper explores various meta-algorithmic choices (\"control signals\") that influence the learning dynamics of neural networks. The authors define optimal control signals by the condition that they maximize the cumulative learning performance (minus control costs) over the learning process. They study the setting of deep linear networks which allows analytic solutions of the learning dynamics equations, and, consequently, enables gradient-based optimization of the control signal. In the experiments, the authors consider control signals describing parameter initialization, learning-rate choice, learning curriculum, and gain modulation. The authors discuss the relevance of their results in the context of cognitive control in neuroscience."

The proposed framework appears as a nice approach to reason about meta-algorithmic choices in the cognitive sciences and machine learning. The authors derive a general framework and apply it to a range of experiments which seem to be well fleshed out. I appreciate that the authors study an analytically tractable variant (linear networks) and derive results that seem to be consistent with the cognitive control literature. While I am uncertain of the practical relevance of the experimental results (cf. weaknesses), I consider theoretical studies of the proposed kind interesting and relevant in their own right. Thus, I recommend acceptance (with low confidence)."

Optimization is a big challenge in neural networks. An analysis focused on the effect of different optimization techniques might be helpful when extending the work on non-linear settings, which is currently being analyzed in only simpler artificial settings.\n3.
