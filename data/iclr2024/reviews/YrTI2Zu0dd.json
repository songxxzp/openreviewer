The KRR estimator with the best possible regularization (this minimizes the true population risk)\n2. The KRR estimator with zero regularization (this minimizes training set error)\n\nThe paper asks when the second estimator, which has zero training error because it overfits the training data, has similar true population risk as the first (and statistically optimal) estimator. Specifically, the paper is interested in bounding the ratio of these risks:\n$$\n\\text{ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Risk of unregularized model}}{\\text{Risk of perfectly regularized model}} \\geq 1\n$$\n\nThe paper is interested in the _agnostic_ setting, where we do not assume that the labeled data points are generated, or even well approximated, by a KRR estimator.

Then, **what is the maximum value that the above ratio can take?**\n\nThe paper provides bounds on this maximum ratio, denoted $\\mathcal{E}_0$.

                "value": "### Overview\nThe paper has some presentation and significance issues. I'll give my opinions and thoughts at the top of this box, and back it up with evidence at the bottom of this box.\n\nFor significance, the worst-case bounds achieved in this agnostic model are tight only in unrealistic cases. Specifically, the worst-case ratio $\\mathcal{E}_0$ should only be representative of the $\\text{ratio}$ for a real ML task if the Bayes-Optimal estimator is the always-zero function.\n\nIt's understandable and reasonable that we give guarantees in the worst case, but the fact that the worst-case is achieved by an unrealistic setting means that I'm skeptical that this theory can precisely characterize when overfitting actually is benign or catastrophic. The result is nice either way, but any practical takeaways will further require understanding the gap between $\\mathcal{E}_0$ and $\\text{ratio}$. This harms significance, but is not a deal breaker.\n\n\n$\\phantom{.}$\n\nThe paper also suffers from a lack of clear discussion of the mathematics involved. This is felt in two key ways: there are no proof sketches or intuitive justifications for why the theorems should be true; and there are no good intuitions given for key mathematical properties of a kernel used in the theorems. The lack of proof sketches harms my confidence that the results are correct, but frankly the results feel believable, so I'm not really marking down a lot here (though the paper would be significantly improved from just a bit of discussion of what the proofs look like).\n\nThe really painful point here is about the **Effective Rank** of a matrix. On page 5, Definition 2 introduces the values $r\\_k$ and $R\\_k$, both called the _effective rank_ of a matrix. $r\\_k$ and $R\\_k$ can differ by upwards of a quadratic factor, but no intuitive understanding of the difference between these definitions is given. Further, it's not even clear why we call these \"ranks\" -- usually the rank of a matrix has no notion of starting to count only from the $k^{th}$ eigenvalue.\n\nTheorems throughout the paper depend on both $r\\_k$ and $R\\_k$, though $r\\_k$ appears more often. I have no understanding of what these value really mean, so when I see Theorem 6 on page 8, I'm not really clear what's going on. This theorem me if our kernel matrix lies in the benign or tempered or catastrophic setting, depending on the limit $\\lim\\_{k\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{k}{r\\_k}$. Is this limit a way of characterizing the rate of decay of a spectrum? What kinds of spectra ___intuitively___ make this limit large or small?\n\nThis lack of discussion really hurts the clarity of the takeaway from the paper.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence\n1. $\\mathcal{E}_0$ _only matches_ $\\text{ratio}$ _if the optimal KRR estimator is the always zero estimator_:\n\n    This follows from the top of page 5, before equation (11). This paragraph says that $\\text{ratio} = \\mathcal{E}_0$ if we have $v_i = 0$ for all $i=1,...,\\infty$. Here, $v_i$ is the $i^{th}$ coefficient in the expansion $f^*(x) = \\sum\\_{i=1}^\\infty v_i \\phi_i(x)$ where $f^*$ is the Bayes-optimal estimator and $\\phi_i$ is a function in the Mercer-theorem-decomposition of the kernel function. Essentially, since $v_i=0$ for all $i$, we get that $f^*(x)=0$ everywhere, and hence that $\\mathcal{E}_0 = \\text{ratio}$ only if the Bayes-Optimal estimator is always zero.\n\n2. _There are no proof sketches_:\n\n    This is in all of the theorems except Theorem 1, which is proven in the body of the paper. Theorems 2 and 3 on page 5 are good examples though. It's just a theorem statement with discussion of the implication of the theorem. No justification for the correctness of the theorem is given.\n\n3. _$r\\_k$ and $R\\_k$ can differ by upwards of a quadratic factor._\n\n    See page 5, just below equation (13)\n\n4.  _Usually the rank of a matrix has no notion of starting to count only from the $k^{th}$ eigenvalue._\n\n    This even holds for \"smooth\" notions of the rank of a matrix, like the intrinsic dimension $tr(K(K+\\lambda I)^{-1})$ or the stable rank $\\frac{\\tr(A)}{\\|\\|A\\|\\|_2}$."

This could just be a difference of perspective though.\n1. [page 3] I have no idea what spherical harmonics or the Fourier-Walsh (parity) basis are, nor how they apply here. I'd cite something here.\n1. [page 3] The omiscient risk estimate and equations (8) and (9) remind me of various ideas from various papers not discussed here. You don't need to discuss them, but I figured I should mention them since they seem relevant:\n    - The effective regularization constant seems similar to the parameter $\\gamma$ in equation (2) on page 3 of _[Precise expressions for random projections: Low-rank approximation and randomized Newton](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10653.pdf)_\n    - The $\\mathcal{L}\\_{i,\\delta}$ values seems to be exactly _ridge leverage scores_, so that for instance $\\sum\\_i \\mathcal{L}\\_{i,\\delta}$ is the intrinsic dimension of the kernel. See eg _[Fast Randomized Kernel Ridge Regression with Statistical Guarantees](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2015/file/f3f27a324736617f20abbf2ffd806f6d-Paper.pdf)_ or _[Fast Randomized Kernel Ridge Regression with Statistical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07263.pdf)_ or _[Random Fourier Features for Kernel Ridge Regression: Approximation Bounds and Statistical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09893.pdf)_.\n1. [page 4] For reader like me, who forget what pareto-optimal is, move the parenthetical \"(point on the regularization path)\" earlier in the paper to the first use of the word \"pareto\"\n1. [page 5] The statement that $k = o(n)$ and $R_k = \\omega(n)$ is one condition, not two. It's not well defined to say that $R_k = \\omega(n)$ without a notion of how large $k$ is. Really, this statement is \"$R_k = \\omega(n)$ for some $k = o(n)$\", which is clearly a single condition.\n1. [page 6] At the end of example 1, explicitly note that $\\mathcal{E}_0 \\rightarrow 1$.\n1. [page 7] It's kinda weak that the tempered overfitting doesn't have any matching lower bound part. We are already given the freedom to pick a really adversarial $y|x$ distribution, so it'd feel much more satisfying if the example could fully indulge a proof that $1 < \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\mathcal{E}_0 < \\infty$. This might be hard, but it'd be a good payoff for strengthening the paper.\n1. [page 8] Theorem 6 should be MUCH EARLIER in the paper. It's really clean and is nice to glance at and understand. It would be nice to first see this limiting result, and then see the finite-sample complexity statements that make it up. We could also then always compare a finite sample complexity result back to Theorem 6 from the (eg) introduction, making everything feel more soundly tied together into a comprehensive story.\n1. [page 8] I'd change the language a bit in the theorem to recall that $\\mathcal{E}_0$ is a worst-case across all $y|x$:\n    - _then overfitting must be benign_\n    - _then overfitting can only be tempered_\n    - _then overfitting can be catastrophic_\n\n    These phrases make it clear that, eg, $\\mathcal{E}_0 \\rightarrow 1$ means that you must always be benign while $\\mathcal{E}_0 \\rightarrow 3$ means that some $y|x$ can achieve this $\\text{ratio}$ of 3 but not that all $y|x$ distributions must do this.\n1.

                "value": "This work study the cost of over fitting in kernel ridge regression. It is reflected by the ratio of the test error without regularizer and the optimally tuned model. It provides the necessary and sufficient conditions of three types of overfitting, benign overfitting, tempered overfitting, catastrophic overfitting. The analysis is under an \u201cagnostic\u201d view."

            "strengths": {
                "value": "1. The work is well organized. It studies three types of overfitting: benign overfitting, tempered overfitting, and catastrophic overfitting separately.\n\n2. The work proves matching upper and lower bounds. It gives a necessary and sufficient condition, dependent on the effective ranks of the covariance matrix, $\\lim_{k\\rightarrow \\infty} k/r_k$, to determine whether the overfitting is benign, tempered, or catastrophic. This resolves an open problem in Mallinar et al. (2022)\n\n3. The work provides several concrete examples to exhibit how their results work."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. For people unfamiliar with the literature, some concepts are hard to understand, for example,  \u201comniscient risk estimate\u201d and the \u201ccost of overfitting.\u201d Can you provide more intuition about these parts?\n\n2. This work focuses on the specific problem of linear ridge regression. The analysis highly depends on the concrete structure of this problem. It might be hard to generalize to other problems of interest.\n\n3. For a purely theoretical paper, this work provides its main results directly, without mentioning the techniques or the difficulty of the proof. Highlighting the techniques used can help the readers understand this paper's technical contribution. For example, when comparing with Bartlett et al. (2020), the paper says, \"Our proof technique is completely different and simpler since we have a closed-form expression.\" This, however, is not helpful enough because it does not provide any equation or concrete comparison to show what the closed-form expression is and where the key difference is."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Theorem 2 and 3 depend on $R_k$, while Theorem 4, 5, 6 depend on $r_k$. What\u2019s the connection of these results, or are they independent?\n\n2.  Although assumption 1 is commonly used in the literature, I\u2019m still curious whether the analysis can work for some different assumptions. What key property of the Gaussian distribution is used in the proof?"
