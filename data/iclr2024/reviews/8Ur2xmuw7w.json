Specifically, it considers that a link can be generated through Local structural proximity (LSP), Global structural proximity (GSP), and Feature proximity (FP). The experiments show discrepancies in the top-ranked edges according to the selected features. The paper suddenly changes to the proposition of a model based on feature proximity, latent node pairwise distance, and some hyperparameters. The paper supports this model claiming that node pairs with a large number of common neighbors tend to have low feature proximity and vice versa, and that this phenomenon is given once the network has been already formed over time. Finally, the paper suggests considering the feature space and structural space by different models and combining them at the end."

As it is mentioned in the paper, the claim is based on a given network, that has already made several connections among them. \n\nThe proposition of the new theoretical model is interesting but not so novel. I mean, while the combination of LSP, GSP, and FP has been largely considered, the novelty is the inclusion of these characteristics in a different factor (more important to FP when nodes have a large distance and vice versa)."

Unfortunately, the paper uses the appendix to explain very important parts of the paper; for example: \"Limitation, broader impact, and future works are in Appendix G, H, and I\". So, if you can not reduce and contain the paper to 9 pages, I suggest you submit the paper to a journal, instead of a conference. Note, I usually read the appendices of the paper. They usually have important proof and complementary results, but in this case, it is being used as a main part of the paper. \n\nThe details of the theoretical models are not explained in the main paper. There are several details without any type of information, for example, the parameter r. It seems then rather than a parameter, r is a hyperparameter, but no details about this are given in the main paper. I have similar issues with the \\beta parameter/hyperparameter, which is described as a feature proximity parameter, but no details about its calculation or suggestion are given. \n\nI understand the main idea of the theoretical model and its importance in the paper, but this is not used in the experiment section of the main paper."

Two natural questions are studied: how much does each help and whether they have overlappings. Then the authors introduce a latent space model and then theoretically demonstrate that the model reflects the effectiveness of LSP, GSP, and FP factors.  Then, based on the undetstandings of the heuristic groups, the authors provide practical guidelines from model and data perspective."

This systematic analysis enhances our understanding of what influences link formation in graphs, contributing to a more comprehensive approach to link prediction.\n3. The revelation of an incompatibility between feature proximity and local structural proximity in link prediction is a significant finding. It highlights a vulnerability in existing GNN4LP models and suggests that certain links, primarily driven by feature similarity, may be challenging to predict accurately.
