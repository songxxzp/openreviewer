If the upper bound of the confidence band is lower, then the empirical fairness is better.  The differences between upper bound and lower bound of the confidence means that the uncertainty is high, thus it is better to choose a method that has small difference especially in the case where a strict fairness constraint is needed.\n\n+ Multiple fairness metric has been evaluated using multiple FR methods.
