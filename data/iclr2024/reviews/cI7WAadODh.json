It is standard in optimization to relax $\\ell_0$-norm into $\\ell_1$-norm. And I think it cannot be viewed as a contribution of this work. Other modifications, including replacing the adjacency matrix with Laplacian (then the variable in the loss function and in the constraint become the same), as well as relaxing the constraint from $\\le 2k$ to $\\le 4k$, are also very slight, from my point of view.\n2. What is the contribution of the proposed framework to solve this problem? It seems to be the use of projected gradient descent. But I think the projected gradient descent is also very standard in optimization. So what is the novelty of this method?  \n3. It is my first time to see polarization minimization. So my confidence is only 2."

The goal is to minimize the polarization of the network by making changes to the weights of the network, subject to a budget constraint. The authors show that polarization is an invex function, and develop an invex relaxation approach to solve this problem. Computational results are presented on both synthetic and real data."

The authors should clarify this. \n\nSome of the content presented in the paper seems superfluous, including the material related to polarization under stubbornness and multi-period polarization.\n\nThe assumptions that the authors make about the distribution of the unknown opinions seems to be quite strong. The authors could make their work stronger by providing stronger justification for this assumption or by examining how this assumption affects their results. For example, the authors could provide computational experiments where these assumptions are violated.\n\nThe authors do not report required computational time of their method.\n\nThe computational experiments in the case where some opinions are unknown could be stronger. The only comparison method that the authors provide is one that ignores all known opinions. It would be good to also apply some of the other existing methods, such as the coordinate descent approach where the unknown opinions are mean imputated."

In particular, given an adjacency matrix on an undirected graph, the problem at hand is to find a new adjacency matrix which only differs from the original by a given budget and minimizes the polarization. It is expected that this problem is difficult in nature (due to the sparse/zero norm constraints), which is what is stated. The authors then provide a nonconvex relaxation and show that this relaxation falls into the category of an invex function minimization, and naturally use this to provide a trackable formulation."
