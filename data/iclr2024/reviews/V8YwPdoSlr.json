                "value": "In this paper, the authors propose a new self-supervised method for medical time series. Their method, CHRONOS, aims to separate features with different temporal granularity explicitly. For that, they propose three objectives, static, short-term, and long-term dependency, using different projection heads between static and dynamic features. The authors also come up with a specific regularization scheme at training called \"selective optimization\" relying on masking the lowest quantile of features (or highest depending on the objective) in terms of similarity with the anchor when computing the objective. They evaluate their method on ECG data on tasks specifically relying on static or dynamic features."

However, the field of SSL for time series is much richer. To cite a few:\n- Franchesci et al. Unsupervised scalable representation learning for multivariate time series NeurIPS, 2019\n- Cheng et al. \"Subject-aware contrastive learning for biosignals\", 2020\n- Mohsenvand  et al. \"Contrastive representation learning for electroencephalogram classification\", Machine Learning for Health, 2020\n- Tonekaboni et al. \"Unsupervised representation learning for time series with temporal neighborhood coding\" ICLR 2020\n- Kiyasseh et al. \"Clocs: Contrastive learning of cardiac signals across space, time, and patients\" ICML, 2021\n- Yeche et al. \"Neighborhood contrastive learning applied to online patient monitoring\" ICML, 2021\n- Eldede et al.  \"Time-series representation learning via temporal and contextual contrasting\", IJCAI, 2021\n- Fan et al. \"Semi-supervised time series classification by temporal relation prediction\" ICASSP, 2021\n\n### Clarity in the method \n\n- The authors don't have a part where they introduce precise notations even though the authors use a lot of different notations. This contributes to making the reading quite complicated and leaves some parts of the method unclear to me.\n\n\n- In addition, the figures don't have descriptive captions. Typically, except for the colors, no description is given for the numerous components of Figure 1. Conversely, in Figures 2 and 3, no explanation is given regarding the coloring scheme.\n\n### Some missing experiments\n\n- The authors use a covariance loss borrowed from VICReg but do not provide ablation for that component. Hence it's impossible to know if performance improvement comes from the disentanglement of the dynamic and static features proposed by the authors or this additional regularization. \n- Similarly, the authors propose to use two projection spaces instead of one because of the adversarial nature of their objectives. Unfortunately, they do not provide an experiment justifying this choice over a unique space.\n- The authors introduce a window parameter for their short-term loss. They don't provide ablation for it."

(5) involves the calculation of the inner product between vectors from the two spaces, which indicates there is in fact only one space. Also, based on the description, it seems that the authors attempted to differentiate three types of temporal dynamics: static, short-term, and long-term. However, the proposed model only learns two types of representations, static and short-term. \n\n- The description of the proposed method lacks clarity. For example, what is the relationship between projector and predictor and that between teacher and student networks. The proposed architecture includes encoder(s), projectors, and predictor. What exactly the representation used in downstream prediction task is not clear.\n\n- The loss functions are not clearly motivated, or least need more explanation. For example, why two different records are used and why projection and prediction are compared while not both projections in Eq. (2). What are i and j in Eq. (3)? Hyperparameters? How were they determined?\n\n- It seems to me that the proposed set of loss functions is problematic, leading to representation that has no discriminative capability across recordings. Eq (2) and Eq (3) drive similarity only and Eq (5) only encourages difference in learned dynamic and static features. What really helping here may be the covariance loss function (Eq. (6)), which needs more explanation and deserves an ablation study.  \n\n- The empirical results are relatively weak across the board. Statistic tests are needed in Table 1 (small difference in mean but with large variance) to show whether the differences have statistic significance."

CHRONOS distinguishes itself by projecting data representations into two spaces and optimizing selective model units for each temporal aspect. The method has been evaluated on electrocardiogram (ECG) signal tasks such as arrhythmia detection, gender identification, and age estimation, showing it can surpass existing methods.\n\nKey concepts include the identification of unique static patterns as biometric identifiers, the volatility in short-term dynamics for immediate physiological changes, and the gradual change observed in long-term dynamics related to slow-evolving characteristics like age or cholesterol level. CHRONOS extends the DEBS approach by using three types of loss functions for distinct temporal representations and captures the evolution over significant time gaps, enhancing the ability to understand and utilize physiological signal patterns for diverse health-related analyses."

                "value": "1/ The authors introduce a new self-supervised learning method that incorporates observations about the nature of temporal data on medical ECG-based tasks which show three different major characteristics: static, short-term dynamics and long-term dynamics. By introducing multiple projection heads for contrasting the static and dynamic characteristics the model is able to learn more about the importance of different features for multivariate time series predictions.\n2/ The authors explain the implementation and evaluation setup in detail, showing empirical performance comparisons that have an increase in performance against previous work."

                "value": "1/ The authors frame the work as generalizing to other applications besides medical ECG however it seems most of the motivation for the design of CHRONOS is very grounded in the specifics of ECG datasets and the provided tasks with references to medical-specific features, model selection, and dataset characteristics. An expansion of the evaluation to standard baselines like UCR, or the FD-a and FD-b tasks used to evaluate TF-C, could help show the proposed generalization characteristics of this approach with more empirical validation.\n2/ There are a number of existing time-series specific transformer applications. FormerTime (Cheng, et. al., 2023), for example, also focuses on multi-scale time series dynamics for multivariate time series classification, albeit without self-supervised learning. The authors should consider evaluations against these time-series specific transformer models such as Formertime and Informer to see if their proposed method continues to add benefit or if simply updating the encoder they use could lead to improvements across all the tasks evaluated using standard self-supervised learning.\n3/ The figures with feature importance and overlap of features for the static and dynamic cases could benefit for my explication of which features were included (e.g. by including the feature name instead of its number).\n\nNits:\n1/ All the references are improperly included in the text. I believe you should change from using `citet` to `citep` in most cases. References should include the author names in the sentence (e.g. \u201cAdditionally a SHAP Analysis *as proposed by* Lundberg & Lee (2017) is carried out\u201d) or by including the author names in the citation (e.g. \u201cAdditionally a SHAP Analysis (Lundberg & Lee, 2017)...\u201d). Please read the \u201cCitations in Text\u201d part of the provided LaTeX template for more information.\n2/ \u201cShort-term\u201d vs \u201cshort term\u201d and \u201clong-term\u201d vs \u201clong term\u201d."

                "value": "1/ Could the authors expand on the implications of the ablation study conducted in section 5? For example: it\u2019s not clear why the removal of the long term loss was only evaluated when the time scale ratio was set to 25/50/25 (basides this being the ratio chosen during selective optimization). Would the long term loss add more benefit in the case where the long-term ratio is higher than 25?\n2/ As an additional ablation, have the authors considered removing the selective optimization and randomly selecting a loss function at each step of the pre-training process? \n3/ In the SSL time series literature, pre-training on the Sleep Heart Health Study is quite common. Why do the authors believe this dataset is more or less useful for pretraining given the tasks at hand? Have the authors tried pre-training on any other datasets?"
