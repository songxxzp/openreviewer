                "value": "1. Firstly, the novelty of the proposed architecture is somewhat limited, as there are already several similar approaches in the field that operate on K-hop neighborhoods in a similar manner. While the combination of permutation-invariant neural networks and linear recurrent networks is a sensible choice, it may not present a significant departure from existing methods. Specifically, the proposed method is very similar to [1], which proposed the following update rule: $h_u^{(t+1)} =COM(h_u^t, AGG_{u,1},..., AGG_{u,k} )$. The main difference is that the proposed approach uses an RNN for the $COM$ function. Moreover, there is no proper discussion of other k-hop approaches such as [2].\n\n2. Secondly, the experiments in the paper are conducted on a relatively limited set of datasets, focusing on long-rage benchmarks, and the absence of experiments on benchmark datasets like TUDatasets raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed model. Expanding the experimental evaluation to a wider range of datasets would strengthen the paper's claims.\n\n3. A notable weak point of the paper is the unavailability of the source code for the proposed model. This omission hinders the reproducibility and transparency of the research. Releasing the source code is not only a common practice in the research community but is also crucial for enabling other researchers to validate and build upon the work presented in the paper. \n\nReferences: \n\n[1] Abboud, Ralph, Radoslav Dimitrov, and Ismail Ilkan Ceylan. \"Shortest path networks for graph property prediction.\" Learning on Graphs Conference.

It would be nice to show how K is selected, and how the different selections of K can affect the task performance.\n3.
