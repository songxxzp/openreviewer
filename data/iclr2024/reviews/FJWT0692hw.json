Experimental results show that SequenceMatch can improve the accuracy in the arithmetic add-or-sub-in-base sub-task of the match dataset, and improve the mauve score in the openwebtext dataset."

We don\u2019t know if the method can generalize well on other tasks. In the second method, the method has a slightly better mauve score, but the perplexity score drops by a large margin. How can we know that this method indeed improves the model generation?\n- The method relies on negative sampling, but there is no reasonable negative sampling strategy provided for open language tasks. This paper provides two negative sampling strategies: random noise and ground-truth noise. As the authors also mentioned in Sec. 6.1, the ground-truth noise needs to be manually constructed for different tasks. The random noise simply samples other tokens in the vocabulary. Both strategies look hard to generalize to open tasks, as it is almost impossible to design ground-truth noise for all the tasks in the world, and the vocabulary for open tasks is too large (the whole token codebook) for the random noise to get meaningful negative samples easily. Thinking about applying SeqenceMatch to the pretraining of LLMs like Llama2, what negative sampling strategy should be used?"

It identifies two drawbacks of traditional maximum likelihood approaches: Firstly, such techniques, like behavioral cloning, allocate weights to sequences based on their prevalence in the training set. They do not consider the problem of guiding the autoregressive model when it starts to be out-of-distribution. To tackle this issue, the authors draw inspiration from Garg et al. 2021 and put forth a non-adversarial objective aimed at minimizing multiple divergences. A distinguishing feature from Garg et al. 2021 is their extension of the methodology to infinite-dimensional state spaces. The second drawback is that classical auto-regressive methods can go OOD by predicting bad tokens. To address this, the authors introduce an innovative approach of incorporating a \"backspace\" token, which has the capability to erase the preceding token. To facilitate the model in learning when to generate this backspace token, the authors suggest the introduction of noise into the training sequences. They then enhance these sequences with the backspace token, employing the modified sequences as training data. Additionally, they present a systematic method to process the backspace tokens in transformers using masking. This ensures that the renowned high-speed learning capabilities of transformer models on GPUs remain uncompromised.\n\nThey compare their approach with classical approaches on an arithmetic task, and on text generation, with positive results showing the effectiveness of the two components."

However, based on my understanding, this extension doesn't seem particularly pertinent to the problems explored in the experimental section. While I'm somewhat familiar with Garg et al.'s work (having read it for this review), the nuances differentiating the two papers aren't immediately clear to me. I'd encourage the authors to better identify these differences more explicitly. While Garg et al. 2021 delves into reinforcement learning, the authors of the current paper narrow their focus to sequence generation, which can be seen as a simpler challenge than the broader realm of RL. The originality of this contribution remains somewhat ambiguous to me.\n\nThe paper's second contribution (introducing backspace) is more algorithmic and makes sense, especially given the efficient implementation strategy the authors have introduced. However, this contribution stands independent of the first, resulting in a paper that seems to amalgamate two separate ideas. While the combined nature of these contributions makes the proposed model efficient, it also emphasizes that individually these contributions are not so strong. \n\n(Small remark: bibliography is in the supplementary material and has to be moved back to the main paper)"

Historically, the MLE has been nice properties, but it is unclear whether Eq (4) has any nice properties with relation to the true divergence. \n* Performance of the proposed approach does not perform much better than the MLE except for MAUVE, when the data does not appear to be OOD (OpenWebText).  Additional experiments on OOD datasets (would artifical noise)   would supplement the results and show better performance potentially.\n* The SequenceMatch approach is relatively slow taking 1.5-8x the training time.

The work does not discuss the opposite, however where the data distribution has non-zero mass, KL minimization will encourage the model to always try to match the distribution - an explicit advantage of KL.  Without minimizing KL my concern is that we do not cover the full data distribution.  Explicitly, to address the main metric of interest in 2.1.1, implicitly the reverse KL would be a good choice to optimize.  This can be a problem especially for a large model or small data.\n* Given that the new metric may not cover the full distribution as well as KL minimization evaluation on retrieval or Q/A tasks where information is needed - will further improve the paper."
