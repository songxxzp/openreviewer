                "value": "This paper considers the problem of cleaning up large datasets used for training and evaluation. The paper considers three kinds of imperfections: (1) samples which are irrelevant, (2) samples which are near duplicates of other samples, and (3) samples with incorrect labels. The proposed approach is to use self-supervised learning methods to learn an embedding of the data and then compute scores for each of the imperfection categories above based on these embeddings. Then, samples are deemed to be flawed based on either a threshold-based criterion or human review. The method is evaluated using datasets with artificially injected flaws, as well as \"in the wild\" datasets (in which metadata and human review are used as ground truth). \n\nI liked this paper because of the problem it considers and the ambition and thoroughness of its approach. However, there are some technical issues and some issues with framing. If tweaked to be a bit more thoughtful along a few axes, it could be a great contribution to ICLR. \n\nI will flag the fact that I don't know the related work well enough to know whether all key baselines are included. On this, I will defer to more knowledgeable reviewers. \n\n# References (used later)\n\n@article{xiao2020should,\n  title={What should not be contrastive in contrastive learning},\n  author={Xiao, Tete and Wang, Xiaolong and Efros, Alexei A and Darrell, Trevor},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.05659},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{cole2022does,\n  title={When does contrastive visual representation learning work?},\n  author={Cole, Elijah and Yang, Xuan and Wilber, Kimberly and Mac Aodha, Oisin and Belongie, Serge},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition},\n  pages={14755--14764},\n  year={2022}\n}"

                "value": "I have a few technical concerns:\n* The paper is built on augmentation-driven SSL methods. The representations learned by these methods are driven by the augmentations they use, which generally need to be chosen in a domain-specific way [xiao2020should]. These seems like a liability for the proposed method, and should be addressed. In practice, how is someone supposed to pick? \n* The SSL encoders which are the foundation of this paper are all trained with default or near-default parameters. Given that those parameters were tuned for ImageNet in the original papers, why shouldn't we worry that the encoders in this work are trained to varying levels of quality, confounding the results? \n\nThe paper's goals can seem a bit detached from real use cases, despite being framed in a very practical way. For instance:\n* One of the three types of data fault considered in the paper is *near duplicates*. Given that the paper considers many medical use cases, this seems potentially problematic. What about adjacent B-scans in an OCT volume? Or adjacent tissue sections in an H&E block? Or longitudinal X-rays from a patient? All of these should be near-duplicates, but may be quite important. \n* One of the three types of data fault considered in this paper is *irrelevance*. This seems like a loaded and insufficiently defined term. Isn't relevance in the eye of the beholder? When does it make sense to have a sample that is correctly labeled but \"irrelevant\" to the classification task at hand? Wouldn't it be obvious from the label that such a sample is irrelevant?\n* Adding X-ray images to a dataset of images from a different domain seems like a contrived task of low difficulty. (One could probably tell an X-ray image from a photograph of a skin lesion using classical image processing methods.) It seems like the \"real\" use case would be more like adding X-ray images of one disease to a dataset consisting of X-ray images from a very different disease. More broadly, it seems like concept granularity is an important missing piece in this work - see e.g. the granularity-depending usefulness of SimCLR features described in [cole2022does]. \n\n## Minor comments\n* This is not an accurate definition for SSL in general: \"...self-supervised learning (SSL), which produces meaningful latent spaces by training features to be invariant to augmentations.\" Consider, say, BYOL or MAE.\n* The text discussing the merging strategy for irrelevant samples is a bit hard to follow. \n* It would be nice if e.g. the metrics in Table 1 could be translated into an estimate of how much human effort is saved. This would help us understand what percentage improvement is necessary to make a meaningful difference between two methods. \n* The \"Comparison with human annotators\" section was a little hard to parse for me. Consider making the metrics and outcomes clearer. Also, \"more often than random\" is a pretty low bar - if something stronger can be said, it should be said. \n* It might be mentioning in the main paper that all of the experiments are done on ViTs (and are therefore confounded with architecture)."

                "value": "0. See \"weaknesses\" section. \n1. Why should we not be concerned about the choice of augmentations underlying the self-supervised learning used in this paper? \n2. Does the synthetic case of adding X-ray images to a dataset of images from a different domain model a realistic use case? \n3. The paper notes that \"the batch size cannot be large\" for SimCLR - why is this? \n4. Table 1 shows that sometimes SimCLR and DINO lead to very different performance and sometimes they do not. Is there any insight to be had into why this is? \n5. Why shouldn't we worry about the proposed method removing difficult but important images or groups of images, especially in a medical context?"

Beyond this, I struggle to identify other novel aspects.\n\nWhile the experiments are detailed, they appear somewhat limited in scope. The authors mainly concentrate on dermatology datasets and their experiments to natural images or other domains seems rather limited. Based on the novelty of the paper I would expect a stronger experimental section.\n\nThe first and second contamination strategies, while intuitive and useful, don't seem to address real-world noise. In the context of medical images, irrelevant examples often include images that are out-of-focus, images with doctor\u2019s annotations, or images with parts from an apparatus. They do not contain random ImageNet examples, PowerPoint slides or data from a different medical modality. Similarly for the duplicates, a simple rotation, resizing etc. is a rather a simplification of real-world duplicates.\n\nThe impact of dataset cleaning appears to be less significant than anticipated. While there are instances where cleaning the evaluation set boosts performance, there are equally instances where has a negative impact on the results.  Most importantly, when the training set gets cleaned, the performance decreases in 3 out of 5 cases. In the remaining 2 out of 5 cases, the gains in performance are rather small. This is important especially considering real-world applications \u2013 dataset cleaning is not only for benchmarking. Only the training set is accessible. The test set remains unknown and probably contains corrupted data.\n\nWhen k-NN evaluation is used, cleaning the training set seems to help consistently (although marginally in most cases). However, this is rather expected given the nature of k-NN evaluation.  However, in reality we care about the performance of linear classifiers and not k-NN. Most importantly, a fine-tuning step, which is a standard expectation in real-world scenarios, seems to be missing from this analysis."

Meaning that if an image is a sketch of a dog, it is hard to tell if it will match more a real picture of a dog or a sketch of a cat using self-supervised features.\nThis means that images from under represented groups or from rare classes will be removed or wrongly flagged as anomaly which is a big issue in medical imaging."
