I'm concerned about whether there is enough room for further development of the core insight of this paper, i.e., learning all tasks in a single prompt. Although I appreciate that the proposed method uses less parameters than L2P and DualPrompt, the improvement seems to be less significant because the prompts are light-weight. \n\n2. In addition to the results of parameter cost and inference cost, I would encourage the authors to further compare their training cost, as the use of contrastive learning usually requires more computation in training phase.\n\n3.

One justification can be the the approach requires two passes through the ViT during inference: one pass with the old prompt and another with the new prompt (referred to as ensemble in the paper). However, without the ensemble also, the approach seems to perform better as can be inferred from table 3 of their paper. Similarly, look the other work [4,5].\n\n[3]. The prompting based model is mostly expansion based approach (where prompt is the expansion parameter) where these approach leverages over the strong pretrained model. In the absence of the pretrained model how the approach behaves? There are few expansion based recent work [2,3] that does not leverages the pretraiend model can author show the result compared to these approach.\n\n[4] In the ablation (Table-4) the author has shown the model performance and prompt parameters growth which is good. The different parameter growth vs model performance is missing. How the model will behave if the prompt parameter are increased? If the next tasks are complex we require model prompt parameter to adapt the novel task.\n\n[5] The paper mentions that the prompt selection  mechanism in l2p and dual-prompt can introduce mis-alignment of prompts.

From this pespective, the loss proposed in this paper is very similar to the regularization loss in LwF. To be more specific, the loss used in this paper requires that the current prompt and previous prompts be similar, essentially demanding that the output of the new model and the old model be similar. However, the authors do not compare their methods to any classic regularization techniques.\n\n2. The comparison in this paper is insufficient, as it does not compare their method to the CODA-Prompt [1]. Different from most existing prompt-based incremental learning methods, the authors use the same prompt for different sessions. To support the technique selection contrary to most existing methods, more comparison is essential.\n\n3. The authors do not provide the performance of using the upper-bound prompt. It is insufficient to only prove that the prompt has been close to the upper-bound prompt. Whether is the performance of using the upper-bound prompt higher than the performance of state-of-the-art prompt-based incremental learning methods using task-specific prompts (including CODA-Prompt and HiDe-Prompt [2])?\n\n4. This method restricts the model ability to learn new tasks, so I suspect that it may not work when there is a large gap between the pre-trained data and new-task data. It is essential to use other pre-trained models or conduct experiments on other datasets, e.g., using the model pretrained on ImageNet-1K with MoCo v3 [2,3]. For more datasets, the authors can refer to [4].\n\n[1] CODA-Prompt: COntinual Decomposed Attention-based Prompting for Rehearsal-Free Continual Learning, CVPR 2023.\n\n[2] Hierarchical Decomposition of Prompt-Based Continual Learning: Rethinking Obscured Sub-optimality, NeurIPS 2023.\n\n[3] SLCA: Slow Learner with Classifier Alignment for Continual Learning on a Pre-trained Model, ICCV 2023.\n\n[4] Revisiting Class-Incremental Learning with Pre-Trained Models: Generalizability and Adaptivity are All You Need.\n\nIn summary, my main concern is that the argument in this paper is not convincing. Theoretically, when different sessions use the same prompt, the prompt becomes a set of continuously updating model parameters. In incremental learning, it is challenging for the prompt to both avoid forgetting old tasks and adapt to new tasks. The reason that most existing works use task-specific prompts is to avoid this problem. This work is totally based on the premise that the same prompt is used for each session, but the author does not delve into why task-specific prompts should be abandoned. Experimentally, the method mentioned in this paper has not been compared to state-of-the-art methods using task-specific prompts, e.g., CODA-Prompt. It is also unknown whether the upper-bound prompt can bring the significant performance increase. Building on the two aspects, I still cannot believe that using the same prompt for all sessions can outperform using task-specific prompts. To justify this claim, more evidence may be required."

Why is the regularization loss in this paper better? This is a very important problem.\n\n3. Can the authors provide the comparison to CODA-Prompt? It will be better if the authors can provide the comparison between their method and HiDe-Prompt.\n\n4. When using the upper-bound prompt, how does the model perform? \n\n5.
