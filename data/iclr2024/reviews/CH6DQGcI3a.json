                "value": "1. SDF appears to consequently require more gradient steps than DF. As such the comparisons in Tab. 2/3/4 are hardly fair. As an additional row in the table, it would be fair to restrict the number of gradients in SDF to the number of DF steps.\n2. As the goal is to improve DF, comparisons to DF are missing in Tab. 5/19/20.\n3. The comparison in Sec. 4.3 against DDN is not fair and thus not meaningful: 1) SDF is trained with different hyperparameters - most notably with more epochs: (200 + 60) instead of (200 + 30). A fair comparison would require training with identical parameters. 2) The results are single-run/seed. Expressive results would require at least 3 runs and error bars - especially for unstable training methods like AT.\n4. \"SDF adversarially trained model does not overfit to SDF attack\" - this statement can - in general - not faithfully be made on a single training run and should be either backed theoretically or empirically on multiple architectures (with reported error bars). \n5. The research field has largely moved on from minimum-norm- and/or $\\ell_2$-based adversarial attacks and is mostly focusing on $\\ell_\\infty$-bounded attacks (if at all). As such, this submission may not be that relevant to the ICLR community.\n\nMinor:\n- Some sections are very hard to read as indirect citations are not in brackets.\n- In Sec. 2 $f_k$ is defined twice.\n- Wrong quotation marks in Tab. 8. In LaTeX: \"xxx\" instead of ``xxx''\n- Multiple tables in the appendix overflow\n- This is a personal taste, but I find it odd to cite (Long, 2015) as a breakthrough in computer vision. I'd have expected earlier works by Alex Krizhevsky or the likes"

                "value": "## Major comments\n\nThe paper is well written and clear and easy to read. I believe it is over the acceptance threshold, however I suggest some improvements that would improve this work.\n\nFirst, limitations are not discussed. The authors should describe the limitations that at least should include:\n* the attack is not adaptive per-se, hence it can be blocked by gradient obfuscation or other defenses that break gradient descent. Is the attack easy to adapt in these cases (e.g., application of EoT to smooth the loss landscape, change of loss to incorporate detectors, ...)\n* the attack is still an empirical attack, thus the authors should discuss that even with the best optimization process there are no guarantees that the points found are global minima of the optimization function.\n* the attack formulation only works for the L2 norm\n* the attack is not tested in the targeted version.\n\nThe authors should also improve the evaluation to include additional insights and analyses:\n* analysis of complementarity with AA, do the two attacks find smaller perturbations for different points? This could suggest whether the best strategy is to add it to the ensemble or to remove directly some of the sub-optimal attacks of AA (e.g., FAB that seems sub-optimal w.r.t. the proposed method). Additionally, in AA the attacks are used in a cascade manner, i.e., if the first attack finds an adversarial perturbation within the eps bound, the other attacks are not launched. Would SDF be launched before or after, e.g., APGD?\n* the other attacks are tested with default hyperparameters, and the authors report that the performances degrade when changing the datasets. However, testing the attacks with a set of hyperparameters could potentially reveal that the proposed approach is sub-optimal w.r.t. the other attacks, while still defeating them because of the parameter-free advantage.\n* additionally, it would be interesting to see the query-distortion curves, such as in other related works (e.g., FMN), as the median is only a compact measure of the performances\n* the attack should also be tested and compared in the targeted version, otherwise, the authors should still list this as a limitation (as it has not been tested, thus it is difficult to evaluate whether this is the best approach in the case of targeted attacks).\n gradient computation $\\neq$ fast attack\n* to claim that the attack finds perturbations \"quickly\", the authors should perform a per-query runtime comparison such as the one done in other papers (FMN, ALMA) to compare the efficiency of the attack in a fair manner. The attack seem to win in any case (given the runtimes reported in the appendix), however a per-query comparison would still be interesting to see, given that there are additional operations within the steps (even if they are probably negligible w.r.t. the time for computing the gradients).\n\nOn the formulation, the attack seems to be clear enough, however the attack might produce invalid perturbations in some domains (e.g., images)\n\n>we clip the pixel-values of SDF-generated adversarial images to [0, 1], consistent with the other minimum-norm attacks\n- The attack algorithm should enforce this constraint \"by default\", as for the majority of applications there are input space constraints and they should be enforced to produce valid perturbations. \nThe authors should also discuss what happens when they enforce this constraint, as, for example, it is probably not possible anymore to enforce the orthogonality with the decision boundary. For this reason, also the plots added in the appendix comparing the orthogonality of FMN and CW might be biased by this additional constraints (while the comment on the line search is not clear, as FMN does not perform line searches unless initialized from the adversarial class).\n\n## Clarifications needed\n\nThere are some aspects that should be clarified to improve the quality of the paper.\n\n> For an optimal perturbation, we expect these two vectors to be parallel\n\n- The authors should clarify this aspect to make the paper accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, a figure with a 2D example might also help clarify this observation.\n\n> DeepFool, C&W, FMN, FAB, DDN, and ALMA are minimum-norm attacks, and FGSM, PGD, and momentum extension of PGD Uesato et al. (2018) are bounded-norm attacks.\n\n- The authors should state that the bounded-norm attacks solve a different problem than (1).\n\n- As it is a scalar multiplied by the gradient, is the first part of eq. 4 an estimation of the step size? Maybe this could be specified in the text to make the description clearer.\n\n- The authors should discuss why the other attacks are not parallelizable, as they state that attacks for AT should be and CW, for example, is not. \n\n## Comments on figures\n\n- caption of Figure 3 should be improved by clarifying all points shown (e.g., $x_2$). Moreover, f(x) used to denote the decision function does not seem to be defined in the text."

For example, it is not clear why the authors propose SDF adversarial training. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate that the attack strength of deepfool can be improved, showing results on using super deepfool for adversarial training, doesn't seem to help strengthening this claim. In case the authors want to demonstrate the utility of using super deepfool for adversarial training, the authors should consider a more rigorous comparison with adversarial training methods like PGD [3], Trades [4] and Trades-AWP [5]. Just including Trades-AWP [5] as a baseline should also work.\n\n* Authors should also include comparison with some strong adversarial attacks which are not trying to find the minimum norm. For instance a comparison against guided margin aware attack [1] can help in developing a better understanding. The authors can also try to determine the norm from the proposed super deepfool and then try strong attacks like carlini and wagner attack [2], multi-targeted attack and guided margin aware attack [1] on the threat model with this norm.\n\n* It would be nice if the authors consider improving the presentation of tables. For instance, Table-3,8, Fig-3 have a lot of whitespace left on the right and left hand, which does not look good. The quality of the figure could also be improved. Further, I think it would be fine if the authors present merge Algorithm-1 and 2. There is a lot of duplicated content in these algorithms.\n\n* It would be nice if the authors incorporate their attack with the autoattack package and analyze a few more defences. Since Table-8 currently shows mixed trends, therefore a more rigorous analysis is required to justify the claims.\n\n\n[1] Sriramanan, Gaurang et al. \u201cGuided Adversarial Attack for Evaluating and Enhancing Adversarial Defenses.\u201d ArXiv abs/2011.14969 (2020)\n\n[2] Carlini, Nicholas and David A.
