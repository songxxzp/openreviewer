With experiments on ImageNet-C and ImageNet-3DCC, the paper shows that the method outperforms some of the recent techniques on TTA on online, continual and federated evaluations. The paper also proposes an analysis tool that is called _lookahead analysis_ which compares the entropy of predictions on a batch before and after doing the adaptation with the source distillation loss."

It is also very unclear if the two problems that the paper set out to solve are tackled, as there doesn't seem to be any quantification of either one. The justification for federated evaluation are not convincing. Additionally, the lookahead analysis tool only measures the correlation between entropy of aux task and test data, but doesn't inform us of the test accuracy. While prior works have shows the correlation between test data entropy and accuracy, this cannot be taken for granted, as the paper doesn't show when the proposed method _doesn't_ work i.e., when is having source distillation not useful or harmless."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The authors essentially re-invented domain adaptation, and try to re-sell this as a SOTA TTA approach.\n\nIn the classical domain adaptation setting, entropy minimization or pseudo labeling methods are combined with a cross-entropy on the source dataset, see e.g. [French et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05208). This is a very well-studied method, and established to work well.\n\nIn this regard, I find the paper story a bit problematic: The authors position themselves in the space of test-time adaptation, which is exactly the setting in which source data is *not available*. The fact that the state-of-the-art TTA model, EATA*, when evaluated in an unsupervised domain adaptation setting instead of a TTA setting becomes better might be obvious.\n\nThat being said, a well-made evaluation on applying domain adaptation techniques to TTA might be interesting to increase cross-talk between the two fields/evaluation settings, but this is completely dismissed by how this paper is written. There is not even a single instance (besides a few titles in the bibliography) mentioning the word \"domain adaptation\", or better, \"unsupervised domain adaptation\", in the whole paper.\n\nI am not sure about the best way to rectify this, and would be happy to engage in a discussion with the authors. I would be especially keen to know:\n\nAdditional main weaknesses:\n\n- I find it confusing that at first, entropy minimization on the source data is introduced, and then switched to cross-entropy. As I noted above, this is a very standard and established thing in the literature, and I would re-write this part of the methods section with that in mind.\n- \"auxiliary task\": I would change the naming here, again, and note that this is unsupervised domain adaptation. The paper title is also very misleading, as it suggests that multiple \"auxiliary task*ss*\" are considered when it is in fact only one.\n- Given my comments about unsupervised DA vs. TTA, an extensive review on SOTA UDA methods is lacking, and fair experimental evaluation towards these SOTA methods. If the authors are interested in rectifying this issue, I would be happy to discuss a set of methods to benchmark against before running experiments.\n- There is no discussion on the additional memory burden introduced by storing the source data in the paper. In Figure 2, EATA and DISTA are compared in terms of additional computation, but not in terms of additional memory. The memory requirement is quite drastic: [ResNet50](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet50.html) weights are quoted at about 97.8 MB per model. Storing the source model is easy (as batch norm params are light), but storing the *source dataset*, which is required for this method, is of course very memory heavy. Can the authors comments if the results were conducted with using the full imagenet dataset, or subsampling it somehow? If the full imagenet dataset is used, this adds 160GB of additional storage. At this storage requirement, it would have been possible to run much bigger models, e.g. an EffNet-L2 ([Xie et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04252)) which cuts the reported error rates much more drasticially than DISTA (under higher compute requirements, of course). The memory requirement is a big limitation, and (in my opinion) one of the main reason why TTA is hard.\n- Why not consider datasets for natural corruptions, like ImageNet-R, -D, ObjectNet, etc., on top of ImageNet-C?\n\nAdditional weaknesses and comments:\n\n- \"signficiantly\" is used throughout the paper, and not a single error bar is provided. Please either compute error bars and proper stats, or replace this by a different term.\n- There is a confusion of \"improvement by X%\" when \"improvement by X percentage points\"/\"X% points\" is meant. I think the confusion is used consistently, though, so might be fine.\n- \"large scale\": I find it questionable if nowadays, ImageNet-C still constitutes a large scale dataset, but this is a minor point/comment. I would suggest to simply drop the term.\n- Methodology: The start is loaded with (in my opinion) unnecessary notation for very simple concepts like how the classifier is setup. I would suggest to make this more crisp, as it does not really add much to the paper, the setup is very standard.\n- The table headings should outlined which model is used for the results\n- How stochastic is the method? Errorbars should be provided.\n- The empirical results are somewhat limited in the breadth of explored methods. It would improve/broaden the scope if additional models, e.g. larger resnets etc. were used.\n\n\n___\n* note that also EATA slightly deviates from the pure TTA setup, as they leveraged clean source images for the computation of their regularizer, cf. the original paper for details."

How were $\\epsilon$ and $E_0$, which influence the weighting of both losses, tuned? An analyis table for varying these two parameters on a hold-out set (or however they were validated) is missing and should be added to the next paper version.\n\n\n**Additional questions:**\n\n- Abstract, \"key challenge in TTA: adapting on limited data\": Can you give references that identify this as a key challenge? Quite to the contrary, when adapting a model at test-time, especially in continual settings, I would argue that a wealth of data exists.\n- Abstract, \"conducting several adaptation steps ... will lead to overfitting\": I am not aware of work suffering from this. Can you give a reference?
