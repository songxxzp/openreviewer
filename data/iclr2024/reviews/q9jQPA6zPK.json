                "value": "This paper investigates the soft cellular robot design problem. Instead of traditional approaches that apply genetic algorithms directly in the design space, this paper proposes to optimize the robot design in the robot embedding space, specifically a 2D hyperbolic space defined by Poincare ball. It constructs the embedding space by first sampling a set of robots in a coarse-to-fine procedure and applying Sarkar\u2019s method to construct the Poincare ball. It then finds the optimal design from the sampled set by applying CEM in the hyperbolic space. During design optimization, it follows previous work [1] to gradually adapt and optimize a transformer-based policy via PPO to control the robot designs in the current CEM population."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The coarse-to-fine process seems specialized for the cellular robot representation in EvoGym. Is it generalizable to other robot design representations, such as articulate rigid robots (e.g. Wang et al. 2019 [1], Gupta 2021 [2])?\n\n2. Since coarse-to-fine clustering is based on running K-Means with different random seeds, it seems to be possible that there are two robot designs located in different subtrees. Will such two designs be embedded in similar locations in the hyperbolic space?\n\n3. Being relevant to the last question, it seems that the cell type is not used during the embedding. If I understand correctly, the embedding only captures the structural/subdivision similarity but not the cell functionalities. How can we interpret the distance in the embedding space into the similarity between designs? \n\n4. Some notations are unnecessarily complicated. For example, it would be easier to understand if just saying the algorithm clusters the robot cells into 2, 4, 8, \u2026, Nc/2, Nc components instead of using logarithm and exponential expressions.\n\n5. Page 6 \u201cIn practice, similarity here means that fine-grained robots only need to change one component to be the same as their parent robots\u201d. What does it mean? The fine-grained robots have more clusters than the parent robot, does it mean the fine-grained robots only change the cell type of one \u201cnew\u201d cell cluster?\n\n6. During the algorithm, is the robot design set fixed after the initial sampling? In other words, when you do $argmin$ in line 9 (Algorithm 1), do you always search for a design in the pre-sampled robot design pool?\n\n7. After reading the paper, the phrase \u201ccoarse-to-fine\u201d is indeed the way of building the candidate robot design pool instead of a coarse-to-fine optimization process. If this understanding is correct, the paper (especially the abstract and introduction) needs to be more clear about this point to prevent confusion.\n\n8. EvoGym has 32 tasks however the algorithm is only tested on 15 of them. It would be great if the authors could evaluate the proposed algorithm on other tasks as well.\n\n9. It would be great to provide the pseudo-code for the ablation variations to help understand the design of those ablation methods. For example, does HERD w/o C2F differ from full NERD mainly on the pre-sampled robot design set? So how does HERD w/o C2F sample the robot design set?\n10. From the visual results, most of the optimized designs only have one single cell type. Does this result from the limitation of the embedding approach since the embedding only captures structural information but is not informative about the cell types?\n\n11. How does the proposed embedding approach compare to other embedding approaches such as neural network embedding (e.g. GLSO [3])\n\n[1] Tingwu Wang, Yuhao Zhou, Sanja Fidler, and Jimmy Ba.
