It first shows that the final approximation error of node embedding is related to the error caused by stale embedding. Then, it uses the stale error of two nodes as the weight of an edge and conducts graph partitioning by minimizing the weight of the cross-partition edges. To reduce the overhead of graph partition, it proposes to adjust partition adjustment instead of running from scratch."

There is no guarantee that minimizing an upper bound for an expression (i.e., the latter part) will actually minimize the expression (the former part). Thus, Theorem 1 should be stated in much weaker form. Second, on the bottom of Page 16, the expressions use the squared approximation error, but on the top of page 17, it becomes the approximation error (without square for the Euclidean norm). If this is not a mistake, it should be made clear how the derivation works.\n2.\tThe performance gain is very limited, and, in most cases, the improvements in accuracy happen only three digits after zero. To make a practical impact, much larger improvements are required.\n3.\tExperiment needs to be improved. (1) In Table 1, the results of many cases are missing, and the explanation is that these results are not reported in their original paper or difficult to reproduce. It should be made clear which results are not reported and which results are difficult to reproduce; for these difficult to reproduce, pls specify why; for these not reported, pls try the best to run the experiments, if you cannot, pls explain the specific reasons; at least provide the results of your method in these cases. (2) Although the paper claims to support very large datasets, the datasets used are actually quite small. Some large datasets are well-known for GNN training, e.g., Papers-100M, MAG240, and IGB. Pls consider using these datasets for the experiment. But I wonder if the many nodes in these graphs will make graph partitioning expensive. (3) To validate the necessity of partitioning adjustment, the authors make check the difference of a graph partition before and after the adjustment. This can be measured by the portion of nodes that change their partition. (4) The influence of the number of partitions."
