                "value": "- The novelty seems somewhat limited.  The only new thing introduced is adding a \"log\" transform in the fine tuning loss function - everything else is prior work. Mean squared log error is not a new metric or loss, and has been used for both training and evaluating forecast models before.  One could argue the connection to error accumulation in this particular setting (and the application particularly to fine-tuning) is the novel part, but this the justification for this does not seem so clear, aside from experiment results.\n\n\n- The paper is not very clear or detailed.  E.g., the actually loss functions used in each training phase are not well defined, there are many details left out, such as how hyper parameters are selected and models tuned.  There are many incomplete sentences.  The details in the explanations / formulation are lacking and not clear.  E.g., many detail are left out in section 4 making it hard to follow.  It's not clearly explained how the error metrics are computed in the reported results - for example, for table 2, an a particular range like 096 - is this computed averaged across predictions for all time steps 1 to 96, or just the last time step?\n\n\n- The justification for adding the log transform in the loss seems lacking and not so clear and not really tied to the motivating points.  \n  - I.e., it's posed that existing approaches (using MSE loss between Nth order n-step prediction and ground truth) for fine-tuning suffer from error accumulation, but it's not clear how the proposed approach addresses this, especially since they end up using the same base error in the loss in the end. They instead state the goal of including more order error terms (i.e., at each time step as opposed to just the last), claiming without any substantiation that this can improve performance - but essentially state it's more efficient to use their approach to approximate this.  Meanwhile, prior work has used errors for each prediction step as well (as this is the typical approach for RNNs or CNNs) - which should already be doing what they are aiming to do (albeit arguably less efficiently) - and this is not compared to in the experiments.  \n  - In the analyses, the authors claim the Nth order error can be seen as the 1st order error plus some error accumulation term, then state that its most efficient to reduce / optimize for this Nth order error by optimizing for the 1st order error plus the \"error amplifier\" term (and subsequently drop the 1st order error part as well) - presumably as a way to bring in the other error terms - but the equating analysis is a bit of a stretch and requires multiple assumptions.  Additionally, they also state that the 1st order error is already accounted for by the pre-training step, so fine-tuning can focus on the error amplifier, which is then roughly approximated by the mean log squared nth order error (bringing the loss back to the original objective anyway, just with a log term).  This seems like an unjustified assumption, since fine-tuning a neural net can cause the original concept learned to be forgotten, but I would suspect that since the nth order error depends on the 1st order error anyway, it would likely avoid the first order error getting worse, but it's not justified in this way here.  \n\n\n- Experimental procedure and results seems a bit lacking.\n  - As mentioned, specifics around hyper parameters and how they are selected are missing.\n  - For experiment results, it's hard to tell if the difference shown is significant, because the differences generally seem very small, no error bars are reported, and apparently a single sample is used to get the test error scores.  Along with not knowing how methods are tuned, it's hard to say if the improvements shown aren't from over-fitting to the particular test sample.  In general it's hard not to be skeptical of the results in light of the lack of details, given the very minor change applied.  \n  - It would also be better to see the mean and variance of the results over multiple test sets (test windows) and model training runs - e.g., with time series cross-validation (sliding window evaluation)\n   - It seems like the e2e approaches are not applied as e2e - so it is not really a fair comparison - as it's stated they are applied auto-regressively after the initial output window, which defeats the purpose.\n  - Another thing that casts some doubts on the correctness of results, is that the forecasts for the 0-96 output horizon for which the e2e models are specifically trained does worse than the auto-regressive approach fine-tuning those same models for additional future horizons, according to the results (Table 2).  This doesn't seem to make much sense - since the fine-tuning is causing the models to focus on future errors which the models are not even evaluated on, and this would typically only match the targeted models performance or possibly make it worse.  Yet somehow in these results it always improves it.  However, this would trivially make sense, if the metric being evaluated in this case is the prediction only on the last timestep in that window (i.e., at time step 96) as the fine-tuning would cause the model to focus more on predicting that time step in particular more accurately (at the expense of other time steps like 95, 94, etc.) - so these results are not really showing anything when it comes to comparing to E2E.  Since for the E2E case we also care about predicting accurately all the time steps before the last one being predicted in that prediction window - and these models were not given the opportunity to be trained focusing on one particular time step - so it's also not a fair comparison."
