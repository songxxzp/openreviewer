                "value": "Wasserstein (W) distance plays an increasingly preponderant role in many machine learning pipelines, since its ability to capture geometric features of the objects at hand. However, it suffers from a heavy computational cost, $O(n^3\\log(n))$ where $n$ is the number of supports of the probability measures. To overcome this computational bottleneck, sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) stands as an alternative to Wasserstein distance. SWD is based on slicing the origin measures  $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ by projecting them on a direction $\\theta$ of the unit-hypersphere and then calculating an expectation (average) of the 1-dimensional Wasserstein distances between the projected measures $\\mu_\\theta$ and $\\nu_\\theta$. This expectation is calculated using Monte Carlo (MC) integration to estimate SWD distance. It is known that the error of the MC approximation is $O\\big({L}^{-1/2} \\times \\text{Variance}[W_p^p(\\mu_\\theta, \\nu_\\theta)\\big]\\big)$. \n\nThis paper proposes a computationally efficient control of the term $\\text{Variance}[W_p^p(\\mu_\\theta, \\nu_\\theta)\\big]$ based on the control variates from the literature on variance reduction. The idea behind this is to find left and right control variates estimators, which are Gaussian control approximations of $\\mu_\\theta$ and  \\nu_\\theta$ with a low variance of their Wasserstein distances.  These estimators share the same computational complexity and memory complexity as the conventional estimator of SWD (vanilla MC estimator)."

I'm thinking about the following scheme: we first calculate these Gaussian approximations of the origin probability measures then an SWD between these approximations and the controlled SWD is given by: $|\\hat{SWD}(\\text{origin measures}) - \\hat {SWD}(\\text{Gaussian Approximation of the origin measures})|$ without adding the factor $\\gamma$. \nI don't know it may highlight the importance of $\\gamma$ to get more ``tight`` control variate.

Can we expect a fast rate of convergence of the controlled variate estimator, e.g. LCV-SWD to the true Sliced Wasserstein distance?

However, to the best of the reviewer's knowledge, there's no way to obtain finite value for KL between discrete distribution and continuous distribution, even under the most generalized setting with Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative. The reviewer acknowledge that this potential flaw does not defeat the purpose of identifying the Gaussian proxy using information of $\\mu,\\nu$ (e.g. as an alternative, through moment matching), but urge the authors to revise this part accordingly.\n2. The usage of 'upper/lower bounds' seems to lack justification, as they are quite different from the Gaussian approach the paper proposes, in terms of how much correlation is changed/lost. In addition, though $\\mathbb{E}[\\sigma_1(\\theta;\\mu)\\sigma_2(\\theta;\\nu)]$ does not have a closed form, it's unclear why it can't be estimated by MC, as is done throughout the paper. (A personal thought: from a statistical perspective, in order to introduce correlation it might be possible to use $\\sigma_1^2(\\theta;\\mu)\\sigma_2^2(\\theta;\\nu)$, if it is at all possible to address.)\n3. The treatment of the resulting estimator from control variates is rough. In particular, the following items need proper discussion: unbiasedness (the biasedness after taking p-root does not justify the biasedness of proposed estimator which is without a root), actual variance of the proposed estimators (which is not the control variate estimator but a further estimator of it), and how good the proposed estimators of coefficients are (e.g. $\\hat{\\gamma^*}$)."

                "value": "I think the authors also miss an important application on computing sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. Since the SW distance can be used to quantify the difference between distributions, it can be used for non-parametric two-sample testing, i.e., given samples from two distributions $\\mu$ and $\\nu$, to determine either $H_0: \\mu=\\nu$ or $H_1: \\mu\\ne\\nu$. Related literature [Wang et al. 2021] used the projected Wasserstein distance (seeks the one-dimensional projector that maximizes OT distance, instead of finding the averaged OT distance among all one-dimensional projectors) for two-sample testing, but it can be naturally extended for SW distance. The authors can use their variance reduction technique to finish this task with superior computational efficiency.\n\nRef: Wang J, Gao R, Xie Y.
