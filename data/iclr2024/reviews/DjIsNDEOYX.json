The investigated problem, learning monotonic neural networks, is important in many fields, where some features are believed to have a positive or negative impact on the concerned output.\n2. To the best of my knowledge, the proposed SMNN is novel.\n3. The proposed SMNN is succinct. It is easy to understand as it only consists of commonly used activation functions, exponentiated weights, and a two-group architecture. Thus, SMNN can be trained by traditional backpropagation algorithms. It is also intuitive that SMNN can guarantee monotonicity."

The authors provide many experiments but it seems that the proposed SMNN has a similar performance to LMN. There are 5 datasets. SMNN wins on 2 of them, loses on 2 of them, and is comparable on the last one.\n----\nThe authors' answers are convincing and I have updated my ratings."

                "value": "1. On page 2, the authors claim that the assurance of monotonicity is not always guaranteed as a regularization method. This is true but I think this should not be treated as the drawbacks of regularization methods. The monotonicity usually comes from experience and may not be the truth. When we prefer to believe the experience, we can use methods in the first group to guarantee monotonicity. But when the experience contradicts collected data, then regularization provides a chance to balance between past experience and new data. Thus, I think it is more suitable to say these two groups of methods have their applications in the real world rather than treating not guaranteed monotonicity as a drawback.\n2. Authors provide two definitions for partial monotonicity, one using function values and one using partial derivatives. However, it seems that the definition using function values is not correct. I think the correct one should be \"The function $f(\\boldsymbol{x})$ is partially monotonically non-decreasing on $\\boldsymbol{x}_m$ iff $\\forall i, x_i \\leqslant x_i' , \\forall j \\neq i , x_j = x_j' \\Rightarrow f(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\leqslant f(\\boldsymbol{x}')$. Take a 2-dimensional case as an example. Let the 1st coordinate be the monotonic feature, and the 2nd is not. Let $f(x_1 , x_2) = x_1 + x_2^2$. Then $f$ is partially monotonic according to the definition using partial derivatives but is not partially monotonic according to the definition using function values.\n3. On page 4, the authors claim that \"ReLU is commonly used as an activation function due to its advantages such as avoiding gradient vanishing\". ReLU helps address the problem of gradient vanishing (compared with sigmoid) but it cannot \"avoid\" gradient vanishing. When the weight parameters are sufficiently small and the number of layers is large, ReLU also faces the problem of gradient vanishing, and other techniques are needed to help address the problem of gradient vanishing. Thus, it would be better to use the verb \"alleviate\" rather than \"avoid\".\n4. In Eq. (5), $h_{con}$ should be $h_{conf}$.\n5. In the current SMNN structure, both the exp unit and conf unit use the ReLU-n activation function for the purpose of universal approximation and aligning output magnitudes. But in the ReLU unit, ReLU is used rather than ReLU-n. I am wondering what will happen if all these three units use the ReLU-n activation function. I think a unified activation function makes the structure more succinct.\n6. In theorem 1, $x$ belongs to $\\boldsymbol{x}_m$. To my understanding, $\\boldsymbol{x}_m$ is a vector rather than a set, which indicates that the belonging relation is not rigorously defined. I think $x$ is a coordinate of the vector $\\boldsymbol{x}_m$. A suitable way is to define the subscript set of $\\boldsymbol{x}_m$ as $M$, and then use $x_i$ with $i \\in M$."

                "value": "Quality\n----------\n1. Regarding the theoretical aspect, and the proof of Theorem 1, an issue is that ReLU-n is not a differentiable function, contrary to the definitions in section 2. Its derivative is not defined at 0 or n. I think the conclusion is still correct due to it being continuous, and that both the left-derivative and the right-derivative at every point exist and are >=0, but the proof and definition should be updated.\n2. The scaling of compute time wrt number of monotonic features cannot really be extrapolated from varying the dimensions from 1 to 20. It's likely that at this scale, the execution time is dominated by constant factors, and it's unclear how it would actually scale to \"high-dimensional monotonic features\", compared to Certified MNN or COMET for instance. Due to the architecture, it is likely that the scaling time _per training step_ would scale up as well as a regular MLP, however optimization issues could happen and slow down convergence, for instance. It would be more effective to demonstrate the scalability of this method by applying it on a problem too big for Certified MNN or COMET.\n3. In Tables 2 and 3, statistical ties should be bolded, and be assessed by a statistical test taking into account the variance of _both_ distributions. Assuming the \u00b1 numbers indicate 95% CIs, there should be many more ties, and the conclusions about SMNN outperforming all other methods on regression tasks to not really hold. For instance, on AutoMPG, 7.44\u00b11.20 and 7.58\u00b11.20 should clearly overlap.\n4. The COMPAS dataset is used despite ethical concerns, since these features were used by the original COMPAS system to produce a score that was unfair and biased. This work uses the dataset despite not explicitly aiming at producing unbiased decisions, or examining critically the trained system.\n\nClarity\n---------\n1. In Table 1, maybe indicate which methods are categorized as \"regularization\", and which ones are \"customized architectures\". Or, if \"customized architecture\" is synonymous with \"end-to-end learning\", maybe indicate it in the caption.\n2. The circled \"+\" signs in Figure 1 is confusing if the operation is concatenation, not addition. Maybe it would be clearer to have both arrows point directly at the next \"Exp unit\"? (Idem for the fc layer)\n3. Why are Table 2 and 3 separate? Both have a mix of regression and classification datasets, but they have a different set of methods, and those in Table 3 do not report parameter counts.\n4. Not clear at first what \"subjected to denoising\" (S. 4.1) means.\n5. Clarify what the \"\u00b1\" numbers in the table means: standard deviation, confidence interval?\n\nSignificance\n-----------------\nThe small scale of experiments is a limitation. Given that the ambition of the algorithm is to be \"scalable\", I think it should try to demonstrate scaling where some other algorithms are limited.\n\nMinor points\n-----------------\n1. Datasets should have citations or footnotes when they are introduced in the main text, not only in the appendix. Maybe also refer to the appendix explicitly for which features were considered monotonic."

Exponential unit preserves the monotonic nature of its input and are explicitly tied to the monotonic inputs. Remaining inputs go through the confluence and the ReLU unit, while the output of the confluence unit also goes through addition with the input for the next exponential unit (see Figure 1). Thus, monotonic inputs pass through a unique path in the network that preserves their monotonic nature.

Does it take longer to converge compared to existing methods?\n- Why are parameters missing for XGBoost and Isotonic methods in Table 2?"
