Are these failures representative?\n- Introduction. It is not clear how the authors measure the time it took to instantiate these failures. Was it a straightforward process, or were there complexities that could affect the time? Are the time metrics (8 hours vs. under 15 mins) average times or one-time measurements?"

In terms of effectiveness, it demonstrates, through human evaluation, that 68.8% of the failures identified with ToolEmu would indeed be considered real-world agent failures. Regarding efficiency, it significantly reduces testing time, generating failures in less than 15 minutes compared to the 8 hours required by existing sandboxes for the bash terminal. ToolEmu assesses the safety and usefulness of various LM agents, offering insights into their performance and the impact of prompt tuning."
