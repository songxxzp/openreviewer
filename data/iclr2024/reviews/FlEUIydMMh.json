                "value": "The positioning of NCFA for causal structure discovery may be problematic as both causal understanding and interpretability are quite constrained. \n\nIt is not really clear how the identifiability guarantee may be beneficial for causal understanding under the constrained settings of NCFA. \n\nThe presented experimental results appear to be preliminary, without much explanations on causal relationships, interpretability, benefits from identifiability and flexibility by having nonlinear mapping using VAE. \n\nThe first part of NCFA depends on the quality of UDG and minimum MCM graphs. UDG appears to be a Markov Network for statistical independence representation. By the nature of Markov Networks, UDG can be guaranteed to be an I-map but not be a perfect map for the data generation distribution. The UDG and induced minimum MCM graphs therefore may not always capture the underlying causal structure faithfully. For example, when we have a M_1 to M_5 forming a Markov chain. Based on the described algorithm, the UDG may just have a complete graph with 5-node clique, which does not really provide any additional causal understanding or constraints in NCFA. \n\nThe authors may want to clearly define what they meant by NCFA being 'non-parametric' and 'identifiable'. For example, the overall FA framework is a parametric setting and VAEs also typically are considered parametric for the source-measurement mapping. If the authors meant that there is no need to specify mapping functional families as being 'non-parametric', it may need to explained clearly. It may also not be fair to claim the advantages on identifiability of minimum MCM graphs in NCFA over the existing other causal structure discovery methods due to the assumed specific settings. \n\nMath notations may need careful proofread. For example, in Section 4, $\\hat{U}$ was referred as 'estimated UDG' in the second and third paragraphs but then as the MCM graph at the beginning of the fourth graph. It is quite confusing. There are in fact many of these examples in the submission."
