                "value": "While researchers began to utilize multi-model data for neuroimaging analysis with the hope to combine distinct information from multiple modalities, the challenge in learning a shared representation space has arisen. The authors pointed out that this is especially nontrivial when dealing with covariance-based data characterized by their geometric structure.\n\nTo that end, the authors proposed a metric termed \u201cgeodesic correlation\u201d that expands traditional correlation consistency to covariance-based data on symmetric positive definite manifolds and measures the consistency of latent representations obtained from paired views/modalities. They further proposed a deep learning framework termed \u201cDeepGeoCCA\u201d for data on symmetric positive definite manifolds that optimizes the geodesic correlation of unlabeled paired data."

The paper is well-written and clearly explains the concepts and methods used in the study. \n\nOriginality: The introduction of geodesic correlation is a novel measure that expands traditional correlation consistency to covariance-based data on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold. The proposed DeepGeoCCA framework is also highly original, as it is the first completely data-driven approach to learn latent representations from paired EEG-fMRI data. The effectiveness of DeepGeoCCA is demonstrated on both EEG-fMRI and fMRI-fMRI datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark tasks.\n\nQuality: The paper is clearly presented and well-structured. With detailed descriptions of the datasets, experimental setups, and evaluation metrics used in the study, it is easy for other researchers to reproduce their results.\n\nClarity: The paper is well-written and the figures are clearly plotted to illustrate the concepts and methods used in the study. \n\nSignificance: The paper is highly significant, as it presents a novel measure and framework for enhancing the consistency of latent representations obtained from paired views in covariance-based neuroimaging data. The proposed DeepGeoCCA framework has the potential to improve our understanding of the dynamic relationships among brain networks and their alterations in pathology, which could lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. The framework is also not limited to neuroimaging data and can be applied to other types of data with geometric structures, making it a valuable contribution to the field of deep learning."

In normal CCA or even deep CCA, we never have such constraints to encourage data points to align with the components. Component analysis is about finding directions that explain the data, not the other way around.\n\n2. My biggest concern is the cross-validation setting. These are small datasets (8, 54, and 12 subjects in three datasets). How do you perform 10-fold CV on 8 subjects? I would then assume that the data split is not on the subject level, but on the matrix level (each subject has many covariance matrices generated by a sliding window). These matrices are derived from overlapping time series and have high dependency. Having subject-level split is essential to make the results clinically relevant, otherwise one would just need to find a method that can overfit to the training data."
