                "value": "This paper proposed a detection model called organ-DETR for 3D organ detection. There are two major designs, one for the multi-scale learning mechanism and another for the dense matching strategy. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that the proposed organ-DETR has achieved superior performance than several public methods for 3D organ detection. The performance gain is impressive and the claims are supported by corresponding experiments. Overall, this work is sound."

The technical novelty should be clearly pointed out in this paper. Another issue is that ICLR might not be the best place for this paper and more technical contributions can be emphasized."

The authors only consider the detection of organs, which occur always exactly once in each scan. Object detection in medical 3D volumes when focussed on (healthy) organs is different from natural images, where the presence/absence of objects or multi-instances is the real challenge. The counterpart in medical imaging would be lesion/nodule detection, which may or may not appear once or multiple times in one scan. As a toy example the organ/bone detection task is fine, but a more realistic setting e.g. including LUNA16 as described in https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnDetection would have to be considered. Table 1 only comprises adaptations of natural image detection pipelines to 3D but avoids direct comparison to realistic medical detection pipelines such as nnDetection or multi-label segmentation e.g. nnUNet. For VerSe (detection of vertebrae that could be well identified by a centre point) many more landmark localisation tools should have been evaluated in terms of localisation error in mm. Even within the comparisons RetinaNet show similar accuracy for VerSe despite slight differences in false positives. I wonder whether at least a direct comparison to the Retina-UNet which was part of the discontinued Medical Detection Toolkit (https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/medicaldetectiontoolkit) could have been included?"
