The principal uses a mechanism to recommend actions for the agents to perform and to decide payments for the agents. The mechanism also elicits information from the agents about their observations of the state of nature. Besides the interactions, the principal also takes an action after the agents perform actions and report their observations. The paper first presents an algorithm based on linear programming to compute the optimal mechanism in the full information setting. It then studies a learning problem where the transition probabilities are unknown. A no-regret algorithm that gurantees sublinear regret is provided for the learning setting."

While I appreciate the effort it takes to set up the constraints for this more complicated model, the insights the approach yields are somewhat limited. The same can be said about the learning algorithms. \n\nBesides that, some specifications of the uncorrelated mechanisms are not well justified (see Questions). The model itself does not look scalable with respect to the number of agents because of the exponential growth of joint action profiles."

The agents are strategic, meaning they could deviate from the principal's action recommendation and report fraud signals. Thus, the exploration phase (with uncorrelated scoring rule) is needed to ensure IC.\n2. The cost differences $C_i(b_i, b_i')$ are unobservable by the principal, which prohibits standard RL methods (via estimating the agents' cost directly) and essentiates the binary searching method.\n3. In the multiple-agent setup, the number of constraints can be growing dramatically without any reduction. \n\nThis paper formulates the multi-agent information acquisition problem, reduces the problem to linear programming that can be solved in polynomial time, and provide online learning guarantee.\nIn particular, the authors show there is a clear separation between the uncorrelated and the correlated mechanism."

Algorithmic Design and Optimization in Multi-Agent Settings: This paper works on designing an efficient algorithm for the multi-agent information acquisition problem, addressing both the optimization and online learning dimensions of interactions between a principal and unknown agents. The proposed algorithm, which navigates through a quadratic optimization problem via linear relaxation, culminates in a polynomial-time solution to the original problem. \n\n2. Addressing Uncertainty in Online Learning: The transition to online learning scenarios, characterized by the principal\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding game parameters, is handled with a robust algorithmic approach, achieving a ($\\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$) regret. This aligns with state-of-the-art benchmarks in single-agent settings.\n\n3. Ensuring Truthfulness and Optimality: They first discussed the relationship between the optimal design and the correlated and uncorrelated mechanism. They also introduce the novel definition of regret as the difference between the optimal (correlated + IC) and suboptimal (uncorrelated + IC, correlated + NonIC). The final phase of the algorithm, committed to achieving an approximately optimal strategy while upholding truthfulness under uncertainty. The authors leverage estimations from previous phases to find an approximately optimal and incentive-compatible mechanism, subsequently combining it with a strictly incentive-compatible scoring rule. This approach demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the trade-offs and complexities involved in designing mechanisms that balance optimality and incentive compatibility."
