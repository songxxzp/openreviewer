This conflict limits the generalization of models. To address this problem, the authors propose a training strategy called Output-Domain focused Biasing (ODB), which emphasizes inductive biases based on output labels. ODB consists of four steps: learning intermediate latent object features, decoupling visual dependencies, capturing structured features optimized for classification, and integrating these features for prediction."

To remedy this, the authors propose a novel method (ODB) where an auxiliary loss is introduced in order to enforce diversity in the latent vectors across classes. This loss term is disconnected from the regular discriminative visual features, so as to not pollute it. The authors show across 5 random seeds that they achieve better results on ImageNet1K than well-known baselines."

At one point in the introduction you instead write 'undescribed world knowledge', which I think refers to the same thing, and is more clear to me. Would it make sense to use another name than ODB? Specifically to change the OD to something else. This would make the paper clearer. Output domain is the domain where you test, which I think does not really do the job here.\n\n* In the related work, a knowledge graph is mentioned briefly while describing the method of one work. However, I miss a small section about the general idea of including hierarchical information or knowledge-graph representations into visual representations, which these authors are not the first to explore. For that reason, it becomes a bit difficult to buy when the authors claim they are the first to raise the issue of the implicit 'output-domain' knowledge missing during training, and a more complete related work section here would make the paper stronger (see for example the related work of Pan et al.)\n\n* The conclusion and future work section does not really contain recommendations for future work."

It seems relevant in your comparison to the baseline which is quite close (84.80 vs. 84.40). You cannot use the term 'significant' in the Ablation study section of Section 5.1 if you do not show these standard deviations.\n* Table 2: explain what w/o Pos. stands for in table caption, even if you also say it in the text (if somebody glances quickly at the table.)\n* Formatting of references generally needed, use {} around text which should be case-sensitive in the .bib-file. (e.g., \"mixup\" >> \"MixUp\" for Zhang et al.)\n* In the end of Section 5.2, it would be great to specify either in the text or in the figure caption which classes numbers 1173 and 1813 correspond to.
