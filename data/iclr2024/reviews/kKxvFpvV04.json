This formula depends on a pre-specified error rate and measures how much inductive bias is required to achieve a certain test error given the hypothesis space under consideration. This quantity can be estimated by first sampling from the hypothesis space (which translates to sampling models that attain a low training error) and subsequently estimating the distribution of test error associated with the previously sampled models. \n\nThe paper focuses on two types of hypothesis spaces: 1) neural networks trained by gradient descent (each element of such a space corresponding to a different initialisation of the weights) and 2) Gaussian Processes with RBF kernel. \n\nThe experiments, performed on MNIST, CIFAR-10, Omniglot and inverted pendulum control, show that the proposed approach provides estimates of the amount of inductive bias that are in line with previous works (despite the latter being based on upper bounds)."

I believe this part should be explained more carefully and more details about the analysis should be provided. Appendix B mainly provided details about the model architecture and hyperparameters but not on how, for example, Fig 4 is obtained.\n\n- As explicitly mentioned by the authors, inductive biases can arise at several levels, including but not limited to, the choice of the architecture and optimisers. Such aspects are not investigated as the reported experiments only focus on MLPs of different width and depth. It is not clear if the proposed method could be applied in this setting. More empirical evidence should be provided.\n\n-  Equation 1 critically depends on the value of \\epsilon which, in practice (see section 4.1) is arbitrarily chosen. I understand that in section 4.1 this is enough to demonstrate the value of the method, but in more general settings choosing an appropriate value of \\epsilon may be less obvious.\n\n- the derivation in Section 3.3 is based on kernel hypothesis space and it is not clear to what extent it transfers to different hypothesis spaces.\n\n- The experiments contain quite simple tasks and architectures.

For instance, the result about the test error distribution (Section 3.3) follows directly from a known one, i.e. it is well known that the sum of squared errors for a linear regressor follows a chi-squared distribution.  Additionally, the statistical result about the finite sample approximation (Section 3.4) is already known for a chi-squared distribution. Why not simply casting the discussion in such terms? (**Originality**)\n2. It is not clear why it is important (i) to introduce new terminology and to distinguish between hypothesis space and model class, (ii) to consider the first space as a superset of the second one and (iii) to define the inductive bias as the negative log probability of sampling a hypothesis in the model class. Regarding the first point and as far as I understand, the inductive bias is merely defined by choosing the proper hypothesis space (architecture and hyperparameters). Regarding the second point, the provided definition of hypothesis space and model class is not consistent with the experiments. Indeed, in section 4.2, the hypothesis space consists of neural networks, whereas the model class includes decision trees, linear regressors as well as neural networks. Clearly, the model class is not a subset of the hypothesis space, as mentioned in Section 3.1. Regarding the third point, especially for experiments about kernel regression, it is not clear why the proposed prior distribution on the hypothesis space represents a meaningful inductive bias (i.e. once you have chosen a kernel and a bandwidth in the case of a Gaussian kernel, there are no additional biases to introduce) and therefore what is the proposed quantity computing? (**Quality/Significance**)\n3. The experimental analysis is quite limited and could be more thourough. This could help to deepen the insights drawn from the analysis. For instance, by comparing different inductive biases inside each function class (e.g. different kernels for kernel regressors, different architectures for neural networks, or different choices of hyperparameters).

These are based on an extremely sparse set of experiments and are not backed by theoretical justifications. Especially for 2) the observation even seems to me quite indirect: I do not think that the method proposed can directly quantify \"the inductive bias encoded in (some subclasses of?) neural networks. I might have missed some detail, and I would appreciate the authors to highlight what are the supporting evidences for these two claims (and carefully consider their quality).\n- From a more subjective standpoint, I have some doubts that the concept of inductive bias can be effectively captured by a (single) scalar number. Rather, the inductive bias of a learning algorithm is the set of explicit and implicit assumption that cause the learning algorithm to \"choose\" one hypothesis (rather than another) and thereby asserting the way the resulting model generalizes. In this sense, I disagree on the definition of inductive bias that the authors give, although I understand that this somewhat subjective. \n- In any case, I find the measure proposed in Eq. 1 rather brittle; by changing threshold and distribution over hypothesis one may obtain essentially arbitrary numbers. Therefore any quantity produced by any estimation procedure of 1 should be heavily contextualized to avoid drawing any unsupported conclusions (this also relates to my 1st concern), casting doubts on the effectiveness and practical use of this measure. \n    - on the top of this, I also think that the definition does not capture well the interplay between inductive bias, sample complexity,  hypothesis space and learning algorithm (as an higher-order functional). In particular, different learning algorithms have different sample complexities, which may result in one algorithm performing comparatively better than another up until a certain data regime; e.g. think about few shot-learning. How does (1) captures or addresses this fact? I think (1) could more explicitly incorporate dependence upon a training regime (which could be simply the number of training examples).\n   - I also have some doubts about folding the learning algorithm into the probability distribution $p_h$. This causes confusion on how to design $p_h$ (and who should do it) and does not consider important details such as the choice of hyperparameters.  \n   - the paper would also benefit from a broader and more careful commentary about the introduced measure. How should one interpret the resulting number?
