                "value": "In the paper \"Towards deep viticultural representations: joint region and grape variety embeddings\", the authors develop a VAE-based approach for learning representations of wine varieties and wine-growing regions. They use data on ~600 wine-growing regions with information on which of the ~1500 wine varieties they grow. The authors train two coupled multinomial VAEs, one encoding wine variety and another encoding wine-growing region. Then the authors argue that the resulting latent representations are meaningful and outperform existing alternatives in terms of representation quality."

The main issues are: (1) lack of clarity in writing and presentation; (2) unclear motivation for a coupled region-variety representation; (3) insufficient and unconvincing evaluation; (4) insufficient benchmark comparisons, in particular using simpler non-deep-learning baseline models."

            "questions": {
                "value": "MAJOR ISSUES\n\n1. I found the presentation very confusing. After reading the first THREE PAGES (\"Introduction\"), I still did not know what the authors want to achieve. I would recommend to have a clear 1-page introduction that explains what the paper wants to do (what exactly is the input data, what is the output, what are the performance metrics). The rest can go into the \"Related work\".\n\n   The whole sampling approach and sampling-based evaluation are not very clear either... Does each variety (and each region) in the end get one embedding vector? Or does it get a whole distribution? Can this distribution be multimodal? All figures that I see in the Appendix contain multiple points per variety/region, but all very unimodal. Is this expected/desired?\n \n   Many technical details are unclear as well. E.g. what K is used for K-means clustering, and why? What are the A/B/C classes used for classification? Etc. \n\n2. The premise of the paper is that they use *coupled* VAEs for joint representations of varieties and regions. This was not motivated clearly enough. Imagine there is one wine region that grows two very different varieties. What is the perfect joint representation of this data? The \"coupling\" only ensures that the entire latent spaces overlap, if I understand it correctly. What would make them overlap meaningfully? I don't understand the setup or the goals here.\n\n3. Regarding evaluation. Tables 1 and 2 assess how clustered the representations are but tell us nothing about how meaningful they are. Table 3 shows that VAEs outperform an extremely simple model based only on 2 features (latitude + longitude). And they don't outperform it very strongly. Table 4 only uses dummy baseline, Table 5 shows that all wine/region parirings are not statistically significant. So the ONLY result that actually shows that the emebddings are meaningful is Table 3; and that result is reather weak.\n\n   I understand that quantitative evalutions may be difficult. But qualitative evaluations are lacking altogether. I would expect to see some visualisations of the latent space, but they are only shown in the Appendix and only using PCA. Moreover, they seem to make no sense! For example, in Fiture 1 in the Appendix, Alvarinho (white grape) is located close to Tempranillo (red grape), and similarly Riesling (white) is located close to Pinot Noir (red). How is this meaningful? Maybe PCA is misleading here, so why not use something like t-SNE? I feel like qualitative evaluation has not even started here.\n \n4. Lack of proper baselines is a big problem. In Table 3, the comparison is to lon/lat model with 2 features. Why not using something that actually uses the A_ij matrix, but without deep learning? Some simple regression/classification models or maybe SVD/NNMF models applied to A_ij matrix? Same for Table 4. The authors use a relatively complex setup (coupled VAEs) for a relatively simple dataset (co-occurence matrix A_ij), so I would expect them to choose some reasonable baselines."

There are also some unclear and unreasonable statements in the article:\n1) The formulas used in this paper are not numbered.\n2) There are errors in the description of variable v_i.\n3) The description of the variables in the formulas is unclear.\n4) Confusing organization of content in the part of the paper that tests the model on downstream tasks.\n6.

The authors should compare their methodology with existing approaches, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to demonstrate its advantages or innovations in the field.\n8.
