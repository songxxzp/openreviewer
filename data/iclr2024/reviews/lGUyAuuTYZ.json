With the right hardware, operations can be saved. The effect of sparsity becomes clear when compared with BNNs that use binary weights. The proposed method seems more energy efficient despite using floating-point weights.\nThe activations achieve a high sparsity. And by using the Hoyer regularisation during training, activations are resistant to noise and achieve higher accuracy than most SNNs, especially ones with only 1 time step."

                "value": "The experiments executed in this paper are generally insightful. It is especially interesting to compare with both BNNs and SNNs. However, some evaluations are lacking detail. The energy consumption is estimated using power numbers of a paper from 2014 at an outdated technology node. Real values obtained from logic synthesis will be significantly different. Additionally, sparse operation induces overhead, such as checking if an activation is actually zero. Those factors are not accounted for in the estimations. Since there was an FPGA simulation done to evaluate the effect of quantisation, I would like to see a power estimation using this FPGA simulator. Alternatively, a GPU evaluation of the actual power consumption is interesting, since it is stated that the BNN operations are compatible with \u201cexisting hardware (standard GPUs)\u201d.\n\nFor comparison of the energy consumption between SNNs and the proposed method, sparsity is used as a proxy. However, it is not clear how the sparsity numbers in Figure 3 were obtained except that they \u201crepresent existing low-latency SNN works\u201d. Were those numbers given by the references or was it a replicated implementation by the authors?\n\nMore emphasis could be placed on the comparison with BNNs. It is stated that SOTA BNNs use network modifications that increase FLOPS but also expressivity. To which extend does calculating the Hoyer extremum during inference incur additional FLOPS? The power estimation in Equation 9 only accounts for one additional comparison.\n\nImportant parameters such as \u03bb are not provided. At the same time, it was not indicated that training code and trained models will be provided. That means it is currently difficult to validate the results of this paper and derive further research. I would see open sourcing as a requirement of acceptance.\n\nThe formatting of the references in the text makes the paper very hard and slow to read. Figure 2 was prominently placed in the manuscript but never mentioned or further explained in the text."

How can the Hoyer extremum be reduced to a simple comparison to make the inference match the equation?\n\nCould you take some actual energy measurements using your already existing FPGA simulator? It would also be interesting to see SNN\u2019s energy consumption on hardware. This way, we do not need to rely on outdated energy numbers from 2014 and also account for the overhead induced by the sparsity.\n\nWhy is the ImageNet energy lower than that for CIFAR-10 in Table 4? Could you elaborate how you arrived at those numbers?"
