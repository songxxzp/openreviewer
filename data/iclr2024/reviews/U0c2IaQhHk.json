Some related works appear to be missing, such as earlier works on sample-efficient RL for low-rank MDPs or MDPs with bounded Bellman-Eluder dimension, or recent works such as admissible Bellman characterization.\n3. Is it assumed, perhaps implicitly, that the reward function is known beforehand? The paper appears to estimate the transition kernel only and does not discuss how the reward function $r$ is estimated. It would be surprising if the paper can obtain the regret guarantee without any regularity assumptions on the reward function. \n4. The algorithm design appears to be similar to earlier works on RL with general function approximation: it appears to be a specialization of earlier algorithm such as OLIVE for when (1) only the transition is estimated and (2) the function class is known to be an RKHS, which allows the optimization problem to be written directly over the space of $M$.\n5. Algorithm 2 requires $S$ and $A$ to be finite, which is not assumed by Section 3.4.\n6. The remark after Algorithm 1 is a bit misleading.
