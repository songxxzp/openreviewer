The authors first developed the threat model in a white box setting, then proposed an algorithm for the black-box setting which performs similar to the white box setting. This method leverages the idea of recursively partitioning the continuous state and action spaces into a binary tree, where each node represents a continuous subset of actions and selecting the nodes from the tree during the attack. The authors also provided theoretical results which shows that the attack costs are bounded under specific conditions in the white box setting. Finally, numerical experiments were provided to three popular RL algorithms in two simple environments."

As stated above, one of my main concerns is the scalability of the algorithm as the numerical experiments were only shown for two extremely simple environments. Could the authors discuss the computational runtime for such the algorithm? It seemed to me that constructing the binary tree for environments which higher dimensional state spaces/action spaces would be prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, computation aside, the results would be more convincing and much stronger if the authors could show similar results on a much more conventional benchmark, like the MuJoCo environments.\n\n2. The results shown are also lacking comparison with existing threat models, even in terms of white-box attacks, such as the work by Sun et al. 2020. \n\n3. There's also sentences in the introduction which I believe the authors should further clarify as they seem like blanket statements to me which might not necessarily be true. For example, \"With the increasing complexity of scenarios, in many cases, reinforcement learning algorithms for discrete state-action environments are no longer applicable\". This seems like a really harsh statement as there is a lot of real world problems where discrete actions are still applicable. Another statement is  \"It is evident that compared to manipulating observations, rewards, or the environment, action-manipulation is not as direct and efficient\". Could the authors elaborate why action space manipulation is more challenging than reward/state manipulation as this seem to be the core motivation for action space attacks over other forms of attack?"

                "value": "This paper investigates adversarial attacks in continuous reinforcement learning environments. The primary focus is on action manipulation attacks, where attackers intercept and modify the actions taken by the intelligent agent before they reach the environment. The paper makes the following key contributions:\n\n1. The paper introduces a threat model for action manipulation attacks in continuous state and action spaces, defining the attacker's goals, knowledge, and capabilities with the help of a target policy. It also introduces the concept of a \"target action space\" to adapt to continuous environments.\n\n2. The research covers both white-box and black-box scenarios. In the white-box scenario, the attacker has extensive knowledge of the underlying processes, allowing for intuitive attack methods. In the black-box scenario, a novel (as far as the reviewer concerned) attack method called \"Lower Confidence Bound Tree\" (LCBT) is introduced to approximate the effectiveness of white-box attacks.\n\n3. In the white-box scenario, the paper proposes the \"oracle attack\" method, which can compel agents using sub-linear-regret reinforcement learning algorithms to select actions that follow target policies with sublinear attack costs.\n\n4. The proposed attack methods are applied to popular RL algorithms, including DDPG, PPO, and TD3, and their effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments.\n\nIn summary, this paper addresses the crucial issue of security in continuous reinforcement learning environments, particularly focusing on action manipulation attacks. It provides a comprehensive understanding of these attacks, introduces new attack methods, and validates their effectiveness through experiments."
