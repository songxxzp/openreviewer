                "value": "This paper proposed a method for improving existing pretrained YOLO networks for object detection. Specifically, in order to reduce the finetuning cost after directly injecting new layers to the pretrained model, the proposed Homeomorphic Model Transformation (HMT) initializes the new injected layers with zero weights and bias such that they do not affect the initial performance of the pretrained YOLO network. Experiments on several datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of their method."

Initialize the new layers with zero convolutions and biases can ensure the pretrained model performance, while enabling the subsequent finetuning.\n2. The performance is great. Experiments have clearly shown the advantage of their proposed method: compared to directly injecting layers into the pretrained model and finetuning, HMT can reduce the computational cost while achieving better performance.\n3. This paper is easy to follow."

For example, ControlNet [A] adopts zero convolution to ensure the initial generation performance is not affected. However, this paper lacks an important discussion of it.\n\n2. Fundamentally, the motivation of keep improving a pretrained network is not convincing. In Algorithm 1, the training loop is conditioning on the marginal performance gain. However, it can be difficult to know if the pretrained network can actually reach the performance after the unknow training time. In the second paragraph, \"...surprisingly, the accuracy can be improved from original mAP of 70.91% to 71.46% (0.55% \u2191),\" Actually, this is not surprising to me since adding one convolution layer, or scaling model size will introduce new parameters, thus improving the model performance [B, C].\n\n3. The writing  and presentation of this paper needs to be improved. For example, \n    - In the Introduction, it is not straightforward to understand what \"fixed architecture\" refers to at the first place.\n    - \"...we simply add one convolution layer in layer 143\". This is confusing. It would be better for the authors to draw a figure here or rephrase the sentence.\n    - Figure 1 is too small, even I can clearly observe it has a lot of blank space.\n   - Section 4.2 \"TIME CONSUMING ANALYSIS\". It turns out that this section is not just about analyzing the time cost.\n   - Table 1. The common practice in the literature is to report GPU hours, instead of seconds without any specification on what hareware.\n  \n[A] Zhang, Lvmin, Anyi Rao, and Maneesh Agrawala. \"Adding conditional control to text-to-image diffusion models.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2023.\n\n[B] Zhai, Xiaohua, et al. \"Scaling vision transformers.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022.\n\n[C] Wang, Wenhai, et al. \"Pvt v2: Improved baselines with pyramid vision transformer.\" Computational Visual Media 8.3 (2022): 415-424."
