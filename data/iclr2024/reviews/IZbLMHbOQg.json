According to the description, it optimizes the objective of evenly distributed cross-attention maps. It disturbs the attention recognition of the diffusion process, but it is unclear how the corruption can be transferred to other pure classifiers without diffusion. Briefly, the loss can help attack diffusion, but how can it help transferability?\n\n2) structure loss: if the purpose is to maintain structure property over diffusion steps, why not directly impose constraints on edges detected by discontinuity detection algorithms or PCA analysis and so on?\n\n3) Evaluation: Lack of ablation study of coefficient in eq. 6 for understanding the interplay of the designed losses.\n\n4) Overall, I feel the loss design (main contribution of the paper) is not fully explained. Basically, it is not convincing why adversarial examples generated by diffusion have better transferability. It is not clear why the designed loss is important, and ablation is missing."

Thus it hinders the technical novelty of this work.\n- In Table 2, the results show that the method performed worse in attacking NIP-r3 and RS, and it performed worse than PI-FGSM to attack Adv-Inc-v3.\n- In Table 4, the authors used FID to measure imperceptibility which is not a visual quality metric, while LPIPS should be more accurate and these results should be presented in the main paper rather than in Appendix.\n\n**Post rebuttal**\n\nI thank the authors for preparing the rebuttal. I have carefully checked the rebuttal and comments from other reviewers, I still feel the technical contributions and the presentation can be further improved. Therefore, I would like to maintain my rating."
