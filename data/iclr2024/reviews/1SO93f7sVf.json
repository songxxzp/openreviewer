The authors' main finding is that frequent synchronization, e.g. every batch, is unnecessary for effective training. Instead, stale gradients may be used effectively reducing the communication overhead. In an experimental evaluation the authors study the impact of number of heads, rank and synchronization delays on a Vision Transformer and ImageNet dataset. They observe that the overall number of necessary training iterations until convergence increases by roughly 20%, while requiring only a third of the memory."
