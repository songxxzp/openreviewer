Perhaps this is a tangent but demonstrating properties of this distance would have been great. This distance is a strength though because of the strength inherent to Wasserstein distance. It could perhaps be well applied in future works.\n\n\nMinor comment: the conclusions start with a typo \"W\""

However, such a relaxation will usually induce large optimization error. Besides, the authors claim that \"However, for large dimensions, the gap is minimal, as our experience demonstrates.\" When I look at the numerical results in Table 2, the optimization gap actually increases when the data dimension increases. Therefore, I think Section 3 does not present a reasonable approach for optimization. \n- Several citations are missing. For example, in the last paragraph of Section 2, the authors introduced particle selection problem using the Wasserstein distance but did not include a citation. It is confusing to tell the specific application or problem formulation the authors are referring to.\n- Numerical study is too stylized."

Equation (9) presents a variation of the Wasserstein barycenter problem. However, the manuscript lacks a comprehensive discussion of the Wasserstein barycenter, and it would be beneficial to explicitly address this concept. Additionally, a comparison of the proposed method with relevant baselines is warranted.\n3. Numerous typographical errors are present in the manuscript.
