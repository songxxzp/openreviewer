It\u2019s interesting to see how an extra exploitation phase at the beginning of each episode helps deeper exploration, which may be of interest to the broad RL community. \n\nIn addition, the theoretical analysis of DEXR-UCB (LSVI-UCB with DEXR) is somewhat interesting.

The effect of the extra hyperparameter, the truncation probability $p$, is not discussed adequately. The paper only mentions that it is set to $1-\\gamma$.

The environments considered are low-dimensional, without a hard-exploration challenge.\n\nWhile I agree that the maze navigation environment is technically a sparse-reward setting, the considered mazes are \u2018simple\u2019 to explore. Even TD-3, without any intrinsic bonus, reliably achieves rewards in three of the four settings and reaches the goal sometimes in the largest maze. Many intrinsic bonus approaches have enabled success in settings where naive exploration (as in standard TD-3)  is far slower and (almost) never succeeds in the considered interactions (e.g., mazes in MiniGrid [1] or hard-exploration atari environments [2]).\n\n**W2.** To properly evaluate the sensitivity of approaches to the intrinsic reward coefficient, further details are needed for how the range for  $\\beta$ was selected. For the navigation tasks, only two values of $\\beta_s=1$ and $\\beta_l=10000$ were selected, and they are extremely wide apart. I have similar concerns for the Mujoco experiments, which use five values of $\\beta$ in the same range. Is there a reason why lower values of $\\beta$ were not considered?\n\n**W3.** It would also be useful to understand DEXR\u2019s sensitivity to truncation probability p. No results are presented regarding this. \nFurther, is there a reason why p is chosen as 1- gamma? \n\nIt would also be better to mention that p is decayed in the main text (not just in the appendix).\n\n\n**W4.** The paper misses discussions regarding Bayesian RL approaches (see [3] and references within), which can elegantly balance exploration and exploitation without ugly coefficients to balance intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. There also exist some scalable variants (e.g., [4]). \n\nOn a separate note regarding presentation, the paper could be improved by incorporating a separate section for the theoretical results. I also felt that the introduction and the related work section (that immediately follows the introduction) could jointly be compressed as there is quite a bit of overlap between them.\n\n\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\n\n### References\n\n[1] Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Dai, B., Towers, M., de Lazcano, R., Willems, L., Lahlou, S., ... & Terry, J.
