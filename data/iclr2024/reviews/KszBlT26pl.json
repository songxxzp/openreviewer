I have strong concerns against the motivations in the paper:\n    1. \u201cMost IRL methods require the transition function to be known\u201d: This is repeatedly claimed in the paper and is considered as the motivation behind this paper. This is not true as a number of works propose sample-based estimators to solve IRL [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. These methods should be discussed and compared against.\n    2. \u201cEmpirical treatment of dynamics using NN\u2019s is not generalizable\u201d: While this statement is true, the way this problem is addressed is not by FP but by using Hermite cubic functions since FP also requires estimating the potential function which has the same learning complexity under a expressible function class. How do other prior methods compare if you use the Hermite cubic function as limited hypothesis class.\n    3. \u201cThis means that the agent employs to reach states whose value function is high\u201d: This is not a true statement as some high value states can be unreachable under a given starting state distribution. A better explanation for the conjecture might be needed. \n2. Novelty: I believe the core strength of paper is in combining FP-dynamics with IRL, merging existing theoretical components. But this combination is not well investigated empirically, experiments are performed on low-dimensional single domain.\n3. Empirical evaluation: It is surprising that no baselines were compared against. There are a number of existing IRL baselines[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] that need to be compared in order to make the claims of the paper stand. The function class of Hermite cubic functions should be ablated in these comparisons as well.\n\n[1]: Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (https://cdn.aaai.org/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-227.pdf)\n\n[2]: Algorithms for inverse reinforcement learning (https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml00-irl.pdf)\n\n[3]: Learning Robust Rewards with Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11248)\n\n[4]: IQ-Learn: Inverse soft-Q Learning for Imitation (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12142)\n\n[5]: Dual RL: Unification and New Methods for Reinforcement and Imitation Learning (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08560)\n\n[6]:OPIRL: Sample Efficient Off-Policy Inverse Reinforcement Learning via Distribution Matching (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04307)\n\n [7]: f-IRL: Inverse Reinforcement Learning via State Marginal Matching (https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04709)"

However, this $\\psi$ function is related to the dynamics. In particular, $\\nabla \\psi$ is the gradient field. It seems unclear to me why the conjecture is true because the $Q$ function depends on the choice of reward function as well. \n\nIt is possible that the authors actually assume that the equivalence is between the (entropy-regularized) optimal policy and the (entropy-regularized) optimal Q function. In this case, it is still unclear to me why the conjecture should be true. It would be great if the authors could at least prove it in special cases such as linear-quadratic case. \n\n2. For discrete-time MDPs, there are existing works that study max-entropy IRL without knowing the transition function. In fact, not knowing the reward seems not a barrier -- we can just estimate the transition from the trajectory data. Thus, the claim that \"While most IRL approaches require the transition function to be prescribed or learned a-priori, we present a new IRL method targeting the class MDPs that follow the It^{o} dynamics without this requirement. \" seems ungrounded. Moreover, it seems unclear to me why Ito dynamics should be used here. \n\n3. Related work.

This equivalence implies that methods that can be used to learn the potential are valid as IRL methods, using the inverse Bellman equation (IQ-Learn [1]). In this work, the potential is learned using variational system identification (VSI). VSI uses a parameterization scheme where the potential is a product of learnable parameters and features expressed using Hermite cubic functions.The learning occurs through minimization of the magnitude of the FP-PDE functional (since we want the FP-PDE function = 0 eventually). Overall, the established connection is interesting, but the use of VSI is limiting, which is reflected in the experiments."
