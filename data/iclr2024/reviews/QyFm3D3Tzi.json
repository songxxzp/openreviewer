                "value": "Although this paper has the above merits, I would like to point out the following concerns.\n\nW1. Insufficient related work and baselines:\n\nThe examination of related works in the paper appears to be extremely insufficient, with a noticeable lack of comparison to existing studies. From my understanding, numerous studies [1,2,3,4, 5] have delved into the application of meta-learning or hypernetworks to tailor prediction models for each node or region, especially [1] and [2] with high impacts in the field of traffic forecasting. It seems that implementing these directly could address the issue of varying data distributions across regions or cities. Therefore, I find it necessary for this paper to provide a compelling justification for the utilization of the framework proposed in this manuscript. What's more, they should be considered as baselines for empirical comparison.\n\nW2. Limited technical novelty:\n\nCompared to existing meta-learning-based methods, this paper has no significant novelty and technical contributions. The primary difference lies in the utilization of a DDPM (along with some prompts) to generate model parameters for each region, without theoretical contributions from the model side. This approach doesn't seem to surpass the acceptance threshold set by ICLR. The originality and technical value of this study could benefit from further enhancement.\n\nW3. Weak evaluation:\n\nFirstly, while the paper asserts that the proposed framework is model-agnostic, this claim is substantiated solely with evaluations on two outdated baselines, published before 2019, while recent methodologies have been overlooked, e.g., [6, 7, 8], see more in [9]. Secondly, the affirmations made in Section 4.4 lack persuasiveness. Figure 4 doesn't offer any insightful revelations, except reporting their differences. For instance, is there any proximity amongst various regions based on their respective POI information? These elements need to be elaborated on for a comprehensive understanding. Thirdly, the paper lacks a discussion on the model's efficiency. Customizing models for each region always brings considerable computational overhead. By the way, the efficiency of the proposed method should be benchmarked against the existing approaches as mentioned in W1. \n\nW4. Some SOTA baselines are missing, such as CrossTReS, MetaST, etc.\n\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Urban traffic prediction from spatio-temporal data using deep meta learning, KDD 2019.\n\n[2] Adaptive graph convolutional recurrent network for traffic forecasting, NeurIPS 2020.\n\n[3] Spatio-temporal meta learning for urban traffic prediction, TKDE 2020.\n\n[4] Region Profile Enhanced Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction via Adaptive Meta-Learning, CIKM 2023.\n\n[5] Hyperst-net: Hypernetworks for spatio-temporal forecasting, arXiv.\n\n[6] Pre-training enhanced spatial-temporal graph neural network for multivariate time series forecasting, KDD 2022.\n\n[7] Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Traffic Forecasting, AAAI 2022.\n\n[8] Spatial-temporal identity: A simple yet effective baseline for multivariate time series forecasting, CIKM 2022\n\n[9] Spatio-temporal graph neural networks for predictive learning in urban computing: A survey, arXiv."

Merely focusing on regional features might not provide comprehensive information.\n- Some alternative methods may consider transferring at different levels or scales, whereas this model appears to only consider regional features. Is there a way to adaptively incorporate large-scale features as well?\n- The authors mentioned the issue of negative transfer between cities as the second limitation in the introduction. However, it is not clear how the proposed model explicitly addresses this problem. Can the authors provide more discussion and experimental evidence?"
