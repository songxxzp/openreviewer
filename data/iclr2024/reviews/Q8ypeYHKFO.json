                "value": "Diffusion models have been a successful generative modelling mechanism in image synthesis. Many works have made creative extensions to use diffusion models for planning and trajectory synthesis. Most of the previous work doesn\u2019t explicitly guide the diffusion process to respect hard safety constraints. Inspired by CBF\u2019s and classical theorems known about barrier functions, this paper proposes to project the diffusion dynamics to improve safety constraints over the course of the diffusion process. Three formulations: robust safe diffuser, time-varying safe diffuser and relaxed safe diffuser are defined with the latter two fixing a critical issue with the first approach. The foundational idea of the contribution has mathematical backing and it is possible to prove from Nagumo's theorem that every point of the trajectory will eventually satisfy constraints. Experiments are performed on maze solving, robot locomotion and manipulation to demonstrate and compare with previous baselines."

As a result, I am leaning towards an acceptance score.\nAdditionally, I found the extensions of the Robust Safe-Diffuser to time-varying and relaxed Safe-Diffuser to be quite interesting. It is believable that the most basic formulation would get stuck in local traps as it is never allowed to violate safety. Additional deeper insights on this phenomenon are appreciated."

Can something like that be amenable to the diffusion process?\n\n4) Would it be necessary to have a large number of diffusion steps in some cases? \n\n5) Is there a possibility of trajectories not being consistent with the dynamics of the environment? i.e. the generated trajectories can have several violations of the underlying dynamics of the robot. If yes, are there some metrics quantifying the dynamics validity of trajectories."
