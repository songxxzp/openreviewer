They further conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses to understand the potential factors of these inconsistencies. While such preference or rating data is essential for recent RLHF approaches as well as evaluation for open-ended generations, it is still unclear whether such data is reliable or what kind of factors affect the overall rating. This work provides an interesting analysis of this important area, and sheds light on several underexplored issues.

Having more detailed discussions on key findings can make this paper stronger (detailed below). I am also not fully convinced by the results of Section 5. Below, I detailed those points. \n\n**Lack of detailed discussions on findings and detailed annotation setup** \n\nParticularily Section 3 and 4 report various interesting phenomena, but some of them lack detailed explanations. For instance, \n\n- Section 3.1 length distributions: despite multiple papers reporting length of responses has a positive correlation with rating, the authors claim there's no difference (\"we find that there is no discernible difference between the average length and average number of unique tokens of the preferred and unpreferred response in the rankings feedback collected from the humans and AI.\"). I wonder if the authors have any insights into this. \n- Section 4.2 Qualitative analysis: the authors say that they sampled a few inconsistent instances and asked annotators to provide explanations for the inconsistencies. I think this is an important and inconsistent analysis and the annotation protocols should be precisely documented. If the claim \"the differences in the preferences of the humans while annotating for different feedback protocols played a significant role in their decision making\" is based on 2-3 instances, the claim may not be fully satisfied. \n\n**The findings of \"Alignment and Evaluation\" section**\n\nI think the findings of Best-of-n policies outperform SFT have been already reported in prior work, and evaluation inconsistency is somewhat predictable given the discussion of inconsistencies. While the second part (inconsistencies) can be novel, I am confused about the descriptions of the results. To my understanding, the finding is if we use a ranking model for Best-of-n ranking we can get higher rates when the same ranking protocol is used during evaluations. For me, it's not really surprising as the reward model is trained on the feedback data and reranks n responses at inference time, so if a model is trained on pairwise feedback data it learns to choose the response preferred in the pairwise setup. It'd be interesting if you could use the feedback data during training (e.g., PPO) and see if the trends remain as well. Yet, I am overall confused with the descriptions in these paragraphs and feel free to correct me if"

One flaw is that a proper baseline is missing here. For example, if you annotate the same examples using another batch of human or sample from the same model (GPT-3.5-Turbo) using different temperature, what would be the disagreement? I would be curious to see such a baseline as it also correlates with the main conclusion of this paper.\n\n- This is not necessarily a weakness but given what observed in the paper, it would be great to see if the authors could take one step further to verify the root cause of the difference and try potential ways to combine the advantages of the two annotation protocols. To me, Figure 3 shows that the ranking-based protocol is more effective and robust (it yield better win rate with ranking-based evaluation protocol and smaller gap when changing the evaluation protocol). This makes sense, as in the rating protocol, the model/human only see each individual answer thus the rating is likely to be less calibrated. Also, seen from the examples in section H, the ranking protocol is likely to introduce some systematic biases. Here is my proposal: can we try the third protocol that instruct the model/human to give both ratings and rankings for either a pair of responses or a list of responses. My guess is that rating annotated in such a way will be better calibrated and the rankings will less likely to be biased."
