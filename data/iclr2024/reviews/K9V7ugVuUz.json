The standard contrastive loss is: \n\n$L = ReLu(d^+ - \\delta^+) + ReLu(\\delta^- - d^-)$\n\nwhere $d^+$ denotes the distance between positive pairs, $d^-$ denotes the distance between negative pairs, $\\delta^+$ denotes the positive margin and $\\delta^-$ denotes the native margin. This loss repels features of negative pairs until they are $\\delta^-$ away from each-other. In effect, the contrastive loss ensures that all negative pairs are $\\delta^-$ away from each-other. This would also satisfy your loss function. Could your loss function be doing something similar to enforcing a negative margin?\n\n- There are some minor issues I saw with the math and the theorems that I don't think are consequential. For example, the notation is quite complicated; I think Algorithm 1 is obvious given the optimization objective in Eq. (8); Theorem 2 seems to trivially follow from the standard GD convergence result; Theorem 4 ignores the tradeoff between generalization and approximation (you say that higher lambda leads to a smaller upper-bound on the generalization gap, but a higher lambda also means $\\mathcal{L}(\\phi)$ is a bad approximation of what you actually want to minimize.) Obviously, it's not hard to design a loss function that generalizes well if you don't care how well it approximates the actual minimization problem; so I'm not sure how meaningful Theorem 4 is.\n\nIf there were a seven, I would give the paper a 7."

Theorem 4 presents a bound on the generalization gap based on max{d'(t; t_hat)}, a metric akin to first-order measurement of feature distance. Despite the notion that smoothness of discrepancy could minimize the largest max{d'(t; t_hat)} by pulling it towards the majority, this mechanism inherently relies on first-order measurement. Consequently, the theorem does not robustly support the paper's primary claim, casting doubts on the reliability of the proposed solution.\n\n2.\tInconsistency between motivation and method. Figure 2 suggests that a smoother distance between different distributions correlates with better performance. However, this conclusion appears flawed. The generalization in a mixed Gaussian scenario is predominantly governed by the distance of the distributions (a first-order attribute) rather than higher-order terms. For instance, three Gaussians with unit variance located at (0,1), (1, 0), and (1,10000) would exhibit a smaller generalization error compared to them being positioned at (0,1), (1, 0), and (1,1). The implication is that sufficient distance, regardless of higher-order distances, should invariably simplify distinguishability.\n\n3.\tWriting issues. I would suggestion the author revise the introduction, mainly on discuss the motivation and purpose of using higher order feature distance, rather than general discussion on representation learning."
