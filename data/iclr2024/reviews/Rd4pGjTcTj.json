The authors propose a method called Parrot-Ask to generate high-quality instruction-tuning data with more human-style instructions. They also introduce a multi-turn evaluation benchmark called MT-Bench++ to assess the performance of chat models. The experiments show that the Parrot-Chat model, trained on the Parrot-Ask data, outperforms other open-source models on various instruction-following benchmarks. The main contributions of the paper include the systematic exploration of multi-turn instruction-following, the development of the Parrot-Ask method, the construction of the MT-Bench++ evaluation benchmark, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

                "value": "- For the first contribution the authors claimed, i.e., \"show that a high-quality instruction-tuning dataset plays a key role in empowering the multi-turn instruction-following capabilities of the chat models\", I think this is obvious enough and has been revealed by many previous works. Personally, I don't take it as a \"contribution\".\n\n- The paper identifies an important shortage of previous methods (self-chatting and iterative self-chatting), but the proposed method lacks intrinsic novelty. I like the idea that we probably need a better model to simulate real human questions; this is interesting, though, but more like an engineering trick, not a scientific research problem.\n\n- It's very strange to me that the authors \"extend dialogue turns based on the dialogues sampled in ShareGPT\". I think most of the dialogues in ShareGPT are already finished and it is unnatural to \"extend\" such dialogues. Extending such dialogues on purpose could make the generated data longer, but not real.\n\n- The generated dataset heavily relies on existing two datasets (ShareGPT and UltraChat), the success of Parrot may be largely owing to the high quality of existing datasets.\n\n- It happens that the performance improvement is because the GPT evaluator prefers the generation that has long content and has multiple rounds of dialogue. I mean the performance is better probably because the model is biased towards generating longer answers, not better answers. Some experiments are needed to further verify this point.\n\n- Minor: given the rapid development of SFT for open-source LLMs, the current SOTA has been leveled to 95%+, even higher than GPT-4. However, the paper only compares relatively weak baselines, I think the author could add several recent baselines to further demonstrate the quality of the proposed dataset."
