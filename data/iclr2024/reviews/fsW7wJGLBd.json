These attacks target Large Language Models (LLMs) and shed light on the vulnerabilities of LLM-based applications to malicious prompt manipulations. The dataset is the largest of its kind, and it reveals that LLMs are susceptible to both prompt extraction and prompt hijacking attacks. The authors use this dataset to create benchmarks to evaluate LLM resistance to such attacks and demonstrate that many models are vulnerable. They also show that these attack strategies generalize to real-world LLM applications beyond the game setting."
