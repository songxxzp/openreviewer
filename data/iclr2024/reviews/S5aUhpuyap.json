                "value": "I have major concerns about the justification and derivation of two central claims (dendritic nonlinear and global oscillating signal) about neural circuit implementation of diffusive models. A possibility is that the text doesn't explain the key math steps sufficiently well. I look forward to seeing some justification in the rebuttal.\n\n### Dendritic nonlinearity\nThe paper directly states the nonlinear dendritic operation $f(x_t, \\beta_t)$ after Eq. 5 without explaining how it is derived. I am confused about how this nonlinearity comes out. Is it directly from $\\mu_\\theta (x_{\\lambda + t}, \\lambda)$ in Eq. 2? In this case, does it imply the dendritic nonlinearity needs to be readjusted if the transition operator in the reverse process is changing? Or it is just used as a way to capture the nonlinearity in biological neurons? \n\n### Global oscillating signal\nI don't understand how the global oscillating signal is derived. Although the author explained the $\\beta_t$ is analogous to the sequence of noise variance in the diffusive model, it seems that the diffusive model doesn't have such an oscillating signal if I understood correctly. I have no idea how Eq. 5 was derived, what assumptions it relies on, and why the $\\beta_t$ becomes a sinusoid function there.\n\n### Training an ANN-based model for dendrites\nThe author says the dendrite is modeled as an ANN whose parameters were trained via gradient descent. Does this imply some mechanism to adjust the dendritic parameters in real neurons? If so, what are the possible biological mechanisms? I don't see related discussions in the paper.\n\nOverall, I suggest the author explain the key motivations, and assumptions in deriving the nonlinear dendrite, global oscillating signals in modulating dendritic noises around Eq. 5. They seem quite critical in this work. In addition, it is better to write a concrete, commonly used recurrent neural dynamics in a single line, and compare it directly with the reverse process in diffusive models. If my major concerns are solved, I'd like to increase my rating."

Does the author mean the neural dynamics of sensory transmission correspond to injecting noise in a similar fashion with the forward process in a diffusive model?

What's the relation between $\\lambda$ and $t$? My understanding is that $\\lambda$ is a non-negative number while $t$ can go to infinity.

For one, the diffusion model in this implementation can be trained as per usual, but how would real dendrites in a neuron go through this learning? The authors state the the learning aspect is for future work, but that\u2019s a huge \u201cif\u201d\u2014is it really realistic to suppose that such a complex mechanism can emerge in vivo, without any hint for the readers of how it could? Additionally, sampling critically depends on a stationary and permanent oscillation, which is rarely found in the brain. Even hippocampal theta, which the authors draw inspiration from, are irregular in time and frequency, nevermind oscillations in other cortical areas. \n\nSecond, the performance is only demonstrated on a relatively simple task of sampling from a very smooth and low-dimensional manifold. I understand that the quantitative results are mostly a demonstration of proof of principle. However, there\u2019s no indication that this would work with mildly more complex high-d distributions, as the authors had originally motivated (and pointed out as a weakness in previous literatures, i.e., mostly Gaussian prior/posteriors). It would be nice to have some indication of how this can be scaled to perform a mildly more complicated task, like conditionally sampling MNIST, or would it be completely infeasible given the architectural constraints? \n\nThese are the two major categories of concern, and I have a number of other concrete issues in the limitation / questions sections below. Taken together, I am skeptical of how much of the claims regarding \u201cneural circuit implementation\u201d is substantiated. And if not, how impactful would the contribution be, which is essentially connectivity-constrained DDPM with an oscillatory noise schedule. Therefore, I recommend borderline reject, noting that it is a well written paper (with some technically dense sections) and solid work but perhaps for a more niche readership, and that I am open to be convinced of its potential biological relevance."

Also, what exactly are the inputs/outputs of the dendritic networks, and what exactly is the somatic \u201ccompartment\u201d doing, or is that functionally just the last layer of the dendrites? Apologies if I had missed this obvious info.\n- In the case of posterior inference (Figure 2/3), do the samples still show zero autocorrelation?\n- I may have fundamentally misunderstood something, but the authors motivate their proposed architecture as flexible, since it can be reused for various inference scenarios, just swapping out or combining likelihoods. This is demonstrated well for the current model, but wouldn\u2019t this be true for a model where a different population encodes the prior as well? Why is it necessary that it\u2019s in the dendrites? Or is that just a \u201csemantic\u201d difference, since the branching networks can equally be implemented as different neurons?\n- Isn\u2019t it typically the case that bottom-up sensory info and contextual info are thought to be likelihood and prior, respectively? Whereas here, they are represented as two different steams of likelihoods. Can the authors comment on this discrepancy?\n- there is a recent body of experimental evidence implicating oscillations of different frequencies coordinating bottom up (gamma, ~40Hz) vs. top down (beta, ~15Hz) signaling (see A. Bastos, EK Miller, etc.), while here it\u2019s crucial that there is a global oscillation of a single frequency, otherwise the prior and likelihood sampling are temporally misaligned.\n- The proposed implementation draws one prior / posterior sample per oscillation cycle, which, given the fastest cortical rhythm (40Hz gamma), results in 40 samples per second, and more likely to be less, e.g., 8Hz theta in the hippocampus. Is this sampling speed too slow? Does it match behavioral data of evidence accumulation?\n- As I mentioned above, most of the time, most areas of the cortex are not experiencing oscillations. Furthermore, oscillations tend to disappear during task engagement (such as 10Hz alpha in visual areas and 20Hz beta in motor areas), which would be a time that is critical for sampling. How reliable would the proposed implementation be in such scenarios?\n- caption for Figure 1F is missing"
