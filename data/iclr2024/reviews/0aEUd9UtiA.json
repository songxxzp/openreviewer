In fact, $J(\\mu)$ is **not** convex w.r.t. $\\mu$ and the duality results can not hold. Consequently, the theoretical analysis presented in this paper is compromised, significantly undermining its contributions.\n\n* The paper lacks clarity. Multiple mathematical objects are introduced without clear definitions. For example, $Q_\\phi(s,a)$, $\\epsilon_\\theta(x_i,i)$, $f_\\phi(y\\mid x_i)$, $H(\\cdot,\\cdot)$, etc. . If the reader is not familiar with the literature on RL and diffusion models, she/he will definitely get confused by the undefined notations. Also, I think the authors should provide more explanations about the exact methods used to update $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$.

I checked the image and did not find such a difference. Can the authors give an explanation?"

The proposed baselines are entirely numerical and quantitative; while convincing, it would have been nice to see some qualitative behavior of DiffCPS compared to other baselines as well in order to strengthen the authors' claims. For instance, trajectory stitching is a popular example in offline RL where unimodal policies might possibly fail if done naively. In simple offline RL tasks such as the X data collection task in Diffuser [1], does DiffCPS succeed?\n\n2. One interpretation of the authors' work is that when we use a generative model of the training data from the behavior policy, this has the effect of automatically constraining the distribution shift between the learned policy and the behavior policy. The authors are missing some relevant work in this direction in the context of model-based offline RL. For instance, [2] motivates a very similar objective with DiffCPS, where the cross-entropy term is penalized rather than constrained (with the difference that the distribution shift is on the state-action occupation measures rather than the action distribution in the model-based setting).\n\n3. On a related note, offline RL also has model-free and model-based approaches, and the author's approach is model-free. The title might give the impression that this method is model-based, though I am aware that the authors' intention was to say it's based on a diffusion generative model. Maybe Diffusion based might be a better title?\n\n[1] Janner et al., \"Planning with Diffusion for Flexible Behavior Synthesis\", ICML 2022\n\n[2] Suh et al., \"Fighting Uncertainty with Gradients: Offline Reinforcement Learning with Diffusion Score Matching\", CoRL 2023"

How specific are the authors' claims to diffusion models? For instance, if we had trained a denoising autoencoder model (assuming they can be trained well), would the theorems still hold?"
