The authors introduced new dataset called EDGAR10-Q of sentences extracted from annual and quarterly financial reports. The entities were automatically extracted and described by experts. Besides, the authors introduced a baseline based on machine reading comprehension model, which doesn't require to train. The authors carried out experiments with several systems: the proposed baseline, few-shot chatgpt, some generative models (e.g. T5). The authors performed some analyses and found that pre-finetuning on EDGAR10-Q (e.g. using T5) is beneficial for some financial downstream tasks, even better than using LLM BloombergGPT 50B."

                "value": "One of the main limitation of the paper is its dataset, EDGAR10-Q. \n\n* First of all, it is unclear how the data were annotated. The paper emphasizes that \"These reports are prepared by domain experts (financial analysts), ensuring highest quality of gold labels and contextual relevance.\" but nowhere in the paper mentions the job of experts. The paper also does not presents the quality of annotation. \n\n* Secondly, it is not clear why entity descriptions can contain information outside of the given sentence. For instance, in \"There were impairments of \\\\$0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and [\\\\$2.2 million] for the six months ended June 30, 2020.\", why could \"\\\\$2.2 million\" can be \"valuation allowance for loan\"? What is the evidence for that? If the reason is of domain \"common sense\", how many experts agree with that annotation? The major concern is that if the sentence itself doesn't contain any evidence, a model trained on this dataset can generate hallucination. \n\n\nAnother limitation is that it is unclear about why the baseline is introduced. In the experiments, the baseline is clearly outperformed. The baseline doesn't have any contribution to the community either. \n\nWriting is also a major limitation. The paper is difficult to follow as its main text is not self-sufficient. To understand the main text, readers need to check appendices. For instance, the main text doesn't introduce the used MRC model, how BERT is used in that model. In the experiments, how were the used generative models finetuned? The number 30.31% (last paragraph page 6) isn't introduced at all in the main text. In additions, there are several typos such as \"Additionally, In...\" (sec 2)."

It is more accurate to refer to these types as attributes of a person or organization. Although some NER taggers (e.g., stanford ner tagger) also recognize the aforementioned types as named entities. \n- The objective of the introduced task is unreasonable. Some entities defined in the paper, such as \"time\", \"money\", do not depend on the sentence context. It seems to be facts or results of an event. It seems unreasonable to generate a phrase based on an irrelevant sentence.\nIt is more accurate to define the task as to generate a concept description given a sentence rather than context NER. \n- The contribution of this work is controversial because the quality of the work cannot be judged based on the difficulty it poses for ChatGPT."

Are they automatically extracted from the annual report? Or the labels are annotated by humans following the instruction in Appendix D.1?\n- It's unfair to compare the model fine-tuned on EDGAR10-Q with the BloombergGPT-50B model since the model performs the task via a few-shot manner while the T5 model is fine-tuned on the dataset. And a dataset analysis about the potential entity overlap between EDGAR10-Q and the downstream benchmark (e.g., FiQA) would be more helpful to understand the benefits. Also, what would happen if we continually pre-train the model on EDGAR10-Q corpus using T5 objectives (i.e., not predicting the phrase label, but pre-training on these finance text).\n- While the authors report the overall performance of the models, it would be much better if they provide a breakdown of the types of errors made or the specific examples where the models fail / be improved after fine-tuning on EDGAR10-Q. This information would be valuable for understanding why the model performance is improved after fine-tuning on EDGAR10-Q."
