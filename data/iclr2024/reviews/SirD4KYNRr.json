Apart from the large number of typos, and repetitions (which I will list separately), there are some major issues with the statements themselves.\n\n1. The problem of the paper is not clear to me. What are the problems where the Invariant Attention is needed? Will it increase the overall data efficiency of ViT-type models? How is the clustering property helpful in this case?\n2. There are no proofs of the theorems and claims, and not even a sketch of the proof or an idea is provided. Though the authors claim to put it in the appendix, it is not possible right now to review the correctness. The definition of \u201cinfimal convex combination reach\u201d, which is an important part of the theory, is not provided even on an intuitive level.\n3. At the same time, there is a lot of redundancy. Some almost self-evident claims are explained in long, like the fact that the invariant mean is indeed invariant under image transformations, which is evident from its close form. \n4. It is not clearly stated which transformations are admissible. Authors claim that their method works for any transformation set, but provide theoretical guarantees only in the case of the T=SE(2). At the same time, they state that Invariant Attention enforces invariance under unknown transformations of the domain, which is clearly misleading, and the transformation set should be known beforehand to construct the kernel.\n5. The optimization procedure for finding invariant mean is not fully described. How are the transformation vectors \\tau_i parametrized in each experiment? Exactly, what parameters are we optimizing, and how? It would be nice to have a clearly described algorithm in the form of pseudo-code or something like that. Also, no information about the time complexity or needed resources is provided in the experiment part.\n6. Not a learnable algorithm. Though the authors claim that they are currently working at implementing learnable weights inside Invariant Attention, its real applicability to modern visual transformer models in the presented form is questionable. It requires running an optimization procedure for each attention head and each pair of image patches only to calculate the kernel weights. This is also dependent on the dimension and complexity of the transformation set and will require training separate models for different symmetry groups. The issue is not addressed in the paper.\n7. Novelty. The kernel attention mechanism was earlier introduced by (Tsai et. al., 2019), and the kernel used in the calculations was described by (Liu et.al, 2021), so the only novel part is in the theoretical results of the paper, which are not significant enough. It is no wonder that we will identify clusters in the data when the data itself is composed of the groups of samples varied through transformations, and we seek to find these exact transformations to match two samples. \n\nThe typos:\n\n1.
