The paper also introduces two sampling techniques to improve controllability and demonstrates that their methods allow for effective image manipulation and translation."

Additionally, it presents Generalized Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) to allow for more natural compositions during inference when conditional inputs are not independent.

Are $z_s$ and $z_c$ just the conditions $c_1$ and $c_2$, respectively? How is this a generalization of CDM?\n\n- Limited novelty. It appears to me that the main contribution involves the addition of joint conditions, rather than simple independent conditions (CDM) in Eq. 3. This is overall a rather simple addition from CDM. Proposition 3.2 is not very interesting, as it appears to simply state that GCDM generalized CDM (which is known) and CDM generalized CFG (which is known).\n\n- Lack of scalability. In the current formulation, it is not clear to me how the proposed method will scale well with increasing conditions. The number of joint conditions required in Eq. 3 seems to grow combinatorially with the number of conditions.\n\n- Lack of ablation study. The authors propose several orthogonal improvements (e.g. timestep scheduling and an adaptive group normalization, a.k.a. AdaGN, layer).
