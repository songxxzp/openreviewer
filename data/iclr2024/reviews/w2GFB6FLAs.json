Their analysis shows that the proposed DFedSGPSM achieves a convergence rate of $ \\mathcal{O}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}} \\right) $ in a non-convex smooth setting.

It seems that DFedSGPSM is a combination of DFedSAM [1] with Push-Sum protocol [2] and momentum mechanism, and the convergence analysis can be thus directly extended by combining existing theoretical analysis methods. The authors should comment on this and clarify what\u2019s the new technical challenge in their convergence analysis.\n\n2. According to Corollary 1, DFedSGPSM can converge at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$. However, existing decentralized approaches such as SGP [2] and D-PSGD [3] can converge at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{nT}) $ where $n$ is the size of the network, which shows a clear linear speedup in the node number. The reviewer believes it is the major limitation in the convergence property of DFedSGPSM. Can the authors improve the rate, or comment on the reason why they cannot achieve the linear speedup ?\n\n3. The authors assume that the gradient is bounded (Assumption 5), which is too restrictive.  DFedSAM [1], SGP [2], and D-PSGD [3] do not need this assumption. With this assumption, the theoretical analysis becomes quite straightfoward. In fact, the gradient can be bounded by $ \\left\\| \\nabla f_i\\left( x \\right) \\right\\| ^2\\leqslant 2\\left\\| \\nabla f_i\\left( x \\right) -\\nabla f\\left( x \\right) \\right\\| ^2+\\left\\| \\nabla f\\left( x \\right) \\right\\| ^2\\leqslant 2\\sigma _{g}^{2}+\\left\\| \\nabla f\\left( x \\right) \\right\\| ^2 $ .\n\n4. The impact of momentum parameter $\\alpha$ on the convergence rate is not discussed in their theeoretical results.\n\n5.

Even so, none of the techniques in this paper is new. The debiased technique for asymmetric decentralized learning, SAM optimizer, and momentum have all been used in the literature. In essence, this paper carefully combines three existing techniques. However, such a combination does not bring sufficient differences in proof and analysis compared to those in the literature.\n\n2. Also related to the previous bullet, one new element in this paper is to extend [Chen et al. 2023] to non-convex settings. But it's well-known that such an extension from strongly convex to non-convex and federated settings doesn't have any major hurdle and can still largely follow the same proof framework. Also, the extension of the K-local step decentralized FL is not new, it has been studied by some references cited in this paper and many others. The bounded gradient assumption (Assumption 5) is also strong. Such an assumption is not needed in many convergence performance analyses. Can it be relaxed? Due to these reasons, the $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate result is well expected.\n\n3. The biggest rationale for incorporating the SAM optimizer is to improve the generalization performance. However, this paper only proved the convergence performance of the proposed DFedSGPSM method. There is no theoretical analysis for the algorithms's generalization performance. Hence, there is no theoretical understanding regarding how much generalization performance gain can be obtained due to the use of SAM."
