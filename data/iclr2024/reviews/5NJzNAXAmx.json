The additional information, denoted as i, is assumed to be a function of the underlying state s, which makes the observation o conditionally independent of s given i. \n\nThe paper then proves that a representation of the history is sufficient for optimal control if it is recurrent and can accurately predict the next reward and the next information i. This is different to the prior works, which looks for sufficient representation that can predict the next reward and the next observation o. \n\nAfter providing a learning objective for such sufficient representations, the paper presents a practical method that combines the learning objective and DreamerV3, a state-of-the-art MBRL method. \n\nThrough experiments, the paper investigates main two research questions. First, does the use of priviledged information during training improve the convergence of the agent? It also briefly studies the impact of different information on the speed of the agents' training."

                "value": "## Novelty\n\nOne of the main contributions of this paper is the proposal of the informed POMDP formalization. \nThe key novelty I find form this formalization is that it enables a new objective for learning sufficient statistics in POMDPs, which relies on predicting the next reward and information instead of the next reward and observation as in prior works. \nBuilding on top of DreamerV3, this formalization leads to a practical MBRL algorithm that leverages additional information during training and does not need to reconstruct observations. \n\nWhile I acknowledge that this is a new and promising idea, I don't find it very novel. \nAs discussed in the paper, asymmetric learning for learning policies in POMDPs has already been well explored. \nThe paper leverages this idea and combines it with MBRL approaches for POMDPs, which are not new neither. \nThe theoretical result is not suprising. Intuitively, if a representation of the history is predictive for the reward and information, it should also be predictive for the reward and observation by the construction of information i. The later has already been proven sufficient for optimal control by Subramanian et al. (2022).\n\n## Experimental evaluation\nI also have concerns on the experimental evaluation. \n\n1. The authors hypothesize that leveraging this additional information will improve the convergence of the agents. However, I don't think this hypothesis is clearly supported by the results as I don't see significant improvement from informedDreamer. Moreover, for domains in which the authors claim that informedDreamer performs better at the end of training, I don't find the results very convincing due to the large standard errors. In Table 2, the large standard errors make the confidence intervals of informed and uniformed heavily overlap with each other. I would strongly suggest to run more random seeds to reduce the standard errors. \n\nI would also like to see more reasoning for the hypothesis that leveraging such additional information will improve convergence. I disagree with the reasoning that because the information i contains more information than the observation o, the new objective will be better than the classical objective. Rather, I would argue that learning to predict i, a more complex variable, instead of o, a simpler varibale as it's function of i, might actually make the objective harder to optimize. And it is not necessary. \n\n2. To understand the proposed method well, I think it is important to investigate the impact of different information on the training. The paper explores this question but only in one environment. I think more ablation study on this question would greatly increase the value of this research. For example, one can conduct similar controlled experiments in other domains. Or dive deeper by looking at the losses of different components of the learning objective."

Does this mean that the standard error is 0?\n- Does the proposed method introduce new hyperparameters? How are they tuned? For example, are there any coefficients used to balance different losses in the learning objective?\n\nMinor:\n- I would suggest to add the uninformed baseline in Figure 4(b) as well for comparison. \n- Typo: Section 3.1 the discount factor \\gamma \\in [0,1[\n- There seems to be a double citation in the second paragraph of introduction: Gregor et al. 2019. \n- Figure 4 can be made larger."
