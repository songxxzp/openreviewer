                "value": "The paper has multiple significant problems:\n- **Unclear writing** There are many points in the paper (particularly where mathematical definitions are provided) where terms are used ambiguously. Here are some examples:\n    - *Definition of Weight Shrinkage Ratio (WSR)*. Just below the definition of WSR, a line says, \"The purpose of WSR is to quantify the ratio of neurons...\" But the definition says \"proportion of weights ...\". Which one is it? The ratio of weights or neurons. In the same definition, the term $h_t^l$ is used, but it is never defined. What is it?\n    - *Definition of Dynamic Weight Rescaling (DWR)*. Again, the paper uses a definition $a^l=h^{l-1} \\odot \\gamma^l$, but \\gamma^l is not defined anywhere. My guess is that it is $\\Gamma^l$. But if that is the case and $h^{l-1}$ is the output from the previous layer, how can we have an element-wise product of $h^{l-1}$ and $\\Gamma^l$? One is a vector, and the other is a matrix. $\\Gamma^l$ is the mask over weights, not neurons?  \n- **Wrong conclusions** The first claim in section 4.2 is that \"shrinkage speed increases.\" But, there is no shrinkage. The weights will only shrink, on average, if the shrinkage ratio is more than 0.5, but the shrinkage ratio is never more than 0.5. So there is no shrinkage; the weights are always getting bigger. The plots show that the weights get larger, not smaller, as training progresses, which is the exact opposite of the main motivation of introducing sparsity.  \n- **Improper statistical reporting** There are many instances where wrong statistical conclusions are drawn. For instance, Figure 6 says that \"Reset buffer distinctly outperforms the Small Buffer strategy in 3 out of 4 tasks, with 2 of these improvements being statistically significant.\" This is wrong. There is no statistically significant difference between the two algorithms in any of the four cases. We can not conclude that one algorithm is better than the other.

They further motivate this by claiming that sparse-to-sparse training can be computationally ineffient, which undermines the reasons for sparsity in the first place. With this motivaiton, the authors propose to modify RL algorithms to periodically reset their replay buffer and to perform layer normalization while ignoring zero activations that arise from sparsification (referred to as \"Dynamic Weight Rescaling\"). They claim that their algorithm, PlaD+SAC, is an improvement over the mean performance of other sparse-to-sparse and dense-to-sparse (but lack statistical significance) on 4 mujoco tasks. They further ablate showing that both components contribute to the performance of their algorithm and that the reset mechanism is statistically significant imporovement over a smaller replay buffer in one of the mujoco tasks.\n# Decision\nI recommend that this paper be rejected, primarily due to confusing motivation, unsubstantiated claims about its connection to plasticity and partially due to the weakness of its empirical results.\nThere are some interesting ideas in this paper that can and should be developed, such as the connection between sparsity and plasticity. This link between sparsity and plasticity is described as a contribution, but I do not see any connection to plasticity in either the algorithm, nor in the experiments. There are also some hints that the proposed algorithm is benefitting from dynamic weight rescaling and a periodic memory reset in the ablation study. Unfortunately, this alone is not enough because the comparisons against the baselines do not show statistically significant improvement over the baselines."

            "questions": {
                "value": "# Detailed Comments\n- Abstract and introduction: Several claims are made but little evidence or context is provided. For example, what exactly about sparse-to-sparse training \"may escalate overall computationa cost\"? The introduction gives some details, giving references to RLx2 that sparse training is 3x more expensive than dense training. But this is not sufficient evidence of an increase in computational cost, because the sparse models per iteration cost may be more than 3x lower than the dense model.\n  Why should sparsity necessarily contribute to less plasticity, there has been no concrete evidence of this connection in the literature beyond very specific forms of (double and triple) sparsity [cite:@zilly21]. Neither the neuron dormancy and primacy bias papers do not provide evidence for this fact. Neuron dormancy, while seemingly related, is about relative mangnitude of activations and provides no evidence that lower magnitude activations can or should be removed.\n- Section 1 (Comments on plasticity): It is stated that the replay buffer is the source of non-stationrity. In a certain sense, the replay buffer may contain information from previous distributions and be a contributing factor to non-stationrity but to state that it is the primary source of non-stationarity is over-claiming. I do not think periodically removing such a large source of experience is worth it, when you can instead just use an on-policy learning algorithm.\n- Section 2.2 (NN Plasiticty): Plasiticty and generalization are two separate problems. The ash and adams paper, for example, has no non-stationarity in the traditional sense, and their results do not demonstrate loss of plasticity. Training error can be minimized, but generalization suffers. Whereas plasiticty is about an inability to minimize the errro. There is a conncetion between the two, but the nature of this connection has not yet been made clear.\n- Section 2.2 (Non-stationarity in DRL): There are transient sources of non-stationarity in deep RL that are present even in stationary MDPs. But, explicitly addressing these is not necessary to design successful DRL algorithm. It remains unclear why this is a particular concern in the training of sparse networks in DRL.\n- Section 4: Equating increased sparsity with increased plasticity is not supported by any previous work, and is not clearly demonstrated in this section.\n- Section 4: (Weight Shrinkage Ratio): I do not understand how WSR can \"serve as an approximation of the first order gradient of shrinkage / shrinkage speed\". First of all, what is the \"first-order gradient of shrinkage\"? What is shrinkage speed, and what is this speed with respect to? I also do not see how this exposition has anything to do with the study of neural network weights because they are not normally distributed besides at initialization.\n- Section 4: (Activation function concerns): Why is this referred to as the weight shrinkage ratio when it is defined over activations? If this were about weights, I do not see why the relu activation would drive the weights to zero. If all the relu activations saturate at zero, then the weights remain unchanged and the weight shrinkage ratio would be 0. This would only be a concern for a \"Activation shrinkage ratio\".\n- Section 4: (Gradient shrinkage ratio): While the details on this are sparse, I also do not see how this has anything to do with plasticity. Gradient shrinkage is a desirable property for achieving a local minimum.\n- Section 4 (Conclusion and connection to sparsity): This section demonstrated that neural network weights shrink over the course of training, but this does not indicate loss of plasticity and you have provided no evidence for a reduced ability for learning.\n- Section 5 (Periodic Memory Reset): While resetting the neural network may be computationally wasteful, the primacy bias paper demonstrates that there is far more value in the experience stored in the replay buffer than in the neural network being learned. Furthermore, if plasticity is being lost then it is a property of the neural network and it is not clear at all whether that issue can be alleviated by resetting the replay buffer and using more on-policy experience. Furthermore, these methods use a higher replay ratio because their goal is sample efficiency rather than computational efficiency.\n- Section 6 (Results, fig 5): I am not able to discern any significant differences from this plot, as many of the error bars are overlapping.\n- Section 6 (Results, fig 6): There is only statistically significant evidence of the reset buffer surpassing the small buffer in one task (hopper-v4). While you study off-policy algorithms (SAC), it would be interesting to show how this compares to an on-policy algorithm.\n- Section 7 (Conclusion): No link between loss of plasticity or sparse training was established.\n# Minor Comments\n- Section 5 (Dynamic weight rescaling): While this is described by weight rescaling, you are rescaling activations? The benefit is that certian weights that are zerod can lead to zero activations, but it is more accurate to call this somthing like \"dynamically sparsified layer normalization\""

However, the motivations behind this research are not entirely clear to me, and I believe they warrant further clarification.\n\n- **The motivation of the sparse-to-sparse training.**\n\nMy expertise lies in the reinforcement learning domain, but my acquaintance with pruning and sparsity is comparatively limited. I comprehend that pruning is theoretically posited to lessen computational demands, yet practically, it might not effectively reduce computational burdens on contemporary hardware due to the intricacies of batching processes. This discrepancy prompts me to question the drive behind adopting sparse-to-sparse training methodologies within reinforcement learning. It is evident that memory conservation during the training of large models like GPT or LLama is advantageous, yet it is less obvious why such a strategy is beneficial or necessary when dealing with the typically smaller models used in reinforcement learning.\n\nMoreover, advocating for sparsity-based training in RL solely on the grounds that it is an established area of investigation does not constitute a convincing argument. A specific, tangible benefit of sparsity in reinforcement learning needs to be identified. Is there a particular aspect of reinforcement learning where sparsity could lead to significant improvements? Could sparsity-based training contribute to advancements in efficiency or performance that are not possible with dense models? These questions need to be addressed to establish a strong motivation for this research direction.\n\nWhile I recognize that my limited familiarity with sparsity-based training might color my perspective, I encourage the authors to provide a more robust justification for the focus on sparsity in the RL domain. Establishing this foundation is crucial for appreciating the importance and potential impact of the proposed Plasticity-Driven Sparsity Training (PlaD) approach.\n\n- **Concerns to periodic memory reset.**\n\nRegarding the strategy of periodic replay buffer resets to preserve network plasticity, there is a prevailing belief, both theoretical and empirical, that larger memory sizes correlate with enhanced performance. This is attributed to their ability to avert local optima and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it is thought that a more extensive memory can mitigate shifts in data distribution during training, thus potentially preventing the loss of plasticity. \n\nGiven these considerations, the efficacy of periodically resetting the replay buffer as a means to improve plasticity or performance remains uncertain. The adoption of this technique appears counterintuitive and warrants a more in-depth justification. How does this method reconcile with the commonly held view that more extensive memory benefits learning? The paper would greatly benefit from a detailed discussion of the trade-offs involved in this approach and its overall impact on the performance of reinforcement learning models."
