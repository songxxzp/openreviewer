Similarly, HiddenKey only demonstrated marginal improvements in Table 2 to 5, with the highest improvement in Table 2 CoLA (1.95%). I would not claim performance superiority given these results. \n\n- lack of analysis: While the paper describes the intuition of how HiddenKey differs from DropKey, DropAttention, HiddenCut, it does not give any analysis to describe the difference in empirical experiments e.g. what features were learned or how the computations are empirically different. Minimally, an ablation study is necessary to elucidate which component of HiddenKey is required for the marginal performance gains. \n\n- unsupported claim for faster convergence: The authors claimed that \"HiddenKey outperforms baseline with shorter finetuning process\". When training a model, the training loss is usually used as the metric to determine when model training should be stopped. In Fig.5, at the point of the black vertical line, the baseline model has clearly plateaued while HiddenKey is still decreasing. To reiterate, if i were to use the HiddenKey method, I would take reference from the plateauing of the training loss and not the accuracy, which in this case is significantly longer than the baseline method."

                "value": "1.\tWriting: \n- The Introduction conclusively describes the phenomenon of overfitting without dropout in PEFT. After reading the Intro, I naturally associate this paper with \u201cDropout neurons in LoRA\u201d or something like this. However, in Sec. 2 and 3, when formulating problems and methodology, there is nothing about PEFT, which makes me really confused about what this paper is really about.\n- The contribution of this paper is not summarized, leading to more confusions.\n- The results that validates the insight (dropout helps overfitting) should be a pivot experiment arranged before the method. Otherwise, the logic may fall in and jump out rapidly, and readers may lose concentration of the conclusion that the results intend to present.\n2.  Investigated Methods:\nWhen talking about dropout methods, it is so limited to only talk about DropKey, DropAttn and HiddenCut methods. At least, the very basic Dropout or DropConnect should be investigated. This paper also mentions dropout in so many aspects: Neuron-wise, input-wise, and also attention-wise. There are so many works concerning those aspects, and a comprehensive analysis can be really complicated. However, there is no systematic analysis concerning different types of dropouts. I suggest to focus on a more specific aspect (e.g., attention-wise). Otherwise, a case-by-case analysis in this paper should not be concluded with such a big title - \u201cPEFT meets Dropout\u201d.\n3.  Theoretical Analysis:\nWhen talking about preventing overfitting, some analyses about the generalization error bound is expected. However, this paper only conducts some gradient calculation to present \u201cproofs\u201d about reducing gradient noises. However, it is unclear what gradient noises are. There is also no formal definition or theories that can defines or support the noise reductions and lower error bounds of your methods.\n4.  Novelty of the Proposed Method:\nThe core method is simply a mixture of three mentioned dropout schemes. I do not think this is novel enough for ICLR."
