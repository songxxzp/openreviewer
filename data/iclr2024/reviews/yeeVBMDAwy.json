These contributions are tested in scenarios with limited labeled data and compare favorably against other methods.\n\nOn the theoretical front, the paper explores both discrete and variational cases. In the discrete case, the variance enlarged approach corresponds to a reduction of the edge-weights, which, under certain conditions, strengthens connections between nodes of the same class and weakens those between nodes of different classes. In the variational case, the minimizer of theoptimization problem is expressed as the solution of a PDE."

However, the conventional Laplace learning approach can be solved directly through a linear system ([1,2]). I'm curious if your method could also utilize a linear system solution. Is there a specific reason for the iterative approach? Is it faster?\n\n2. **Relation to Previous Work:**\n   \n   - In [2], Laplace learning was associated with the probability of sampling a spanning forest that separates the seeds. Do you think your approach could also have a similar interpretation in this context?\n\n3. **Consideration of Directed Graphs:**\n   \n   - As far as I understand, your approach does not consider directed graphs. Does your approach and the theoretical insights extend to the directed case as well?\n\n4. **Convergence Dependency on Parameters:**\n   \n   - I'm interested in understanding how the convergence of your algorithms is influenced by the value of $\\lambda$. Could you shed some light on this relationship?\n\n5. **Clarification on Lemma 4.1:**\n   \n   - In the final step of Lemma 4.1, it seems that the sum of $q_j$ is factored out of the norm. However, this step isn't clear to me. Could you provide a more explicit explanation of how this is done? To illustrate, if I consider $(u_1,u_2)=(0.5,1)$, $(q_1,q_2)=(0.5,0.5)$, $\\lambda=1$ and $w_{12}=w_{21}=1$, the equation doesn't seem to balance. The right term of the inequality is equal to \n$\\sum_i^n\\sum_j^n(w_{ij}-\\lambda q_iq_j)||u(x_i)-u(x_j)||_2^2=$ \n\n$=2\\left((w_{12}-\\lambda q_1q_2)(u_1-u_2)^2\\right)=2\\left((1-0.5^2)(0.5-1)^2\\right)=0.375$\n\nWhile the left term is equal to\n\n$\\sum_i^n\\sum_j^n(w_{ij})||u(x_i)-u(x_j)||_2^2-\\lambda\\sum_i^nq_i\\left|\\left|u(x_i)-\\sum_j^nq_ju(x_j)\\right|\\right|^2_2=$\n\n$=2\\left(w_{12}(u_1-u_2)^2\\right)-\\left(q_1\\left(u_1-\\left(q_1u_1+q_2u_2\\right)\\right)^2+q_2\\left(u_2-\\left(q_1u_1+q_2u_2\\right)\\right)^2\\right)=$\n$=2\\cdot0.5^2-\\left(0.5\\left(0.5-\\left(0.5\\cdot0.5+0.5\\cdot 1\\right)\\right)^2+0.5\\left(1-\\left(0.5\\cdot0.5+0.5\\cdot 1\\right)\\right)^2\\right)\\\\\n     =0.4375$\n\nThis clarification is crucial as Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 4.3 depend on this Lemma.\n\n6. **Typos**:\n   \n   - In proposition 4.3 references Theorem 4.1.

It would be beneficial to expand the experiments to larger datasets, such as ImageNet.\n- Typos: e.g., lambda in the caption of Figure 1.\n\nMy other concern is the practical value of such graph-based (parameter-free) semi-supervised learning methods. As shown in Table 2 and Table 3, despite significant improvements over the baselines, the accuracy of the proposed method still falls short of being satisfactory. To my knowledge, parameterized models like ResNet and ViT-based self-supervised learning methods tend to perform better in cases of label sparsity.

Graph SSL techniques are a popular class of approaches where by constructing a graph with data points nodes and relationship edges, information can be propagated across the graph to make predictions on unlabeled data. A well-recognized limitation of typical Graph SSL techniques is the problem of degenerate solutions where, when the labeled sample is sparse, the nodes far away from any labeled sample can converge to a constant and uninformative value.\n\nThis paper proposes a simple and intuitive fix to degeneracy issue by regularizing the node values to be different from one another through a term that increases the variance between node values. Clear theoretical insights have been provided to show that, when the graph edges connect same class nodes more often than others, variance enlargement can amplify the importance of edge weights connecting vertices within the same class, while simultaneously diminishing the importance of those connecting vertices from different classes, thus leading to improved solutions.\n\nExperimental results show salient gains due to variance enlargement regularize on a variety of datasets."
