Therefore an important question need to be answered: are there any datasets satisfying $I(X_{test};Z)\\geq I(X_{tr};Z)$?  There lacks empirical evidences in this paper to answer the question and I do not think the algorithm 1 could effectively detect shortcuts.\n\n2). Unlike the proposed algorithm 1, the experiments in this paper, on the other hand, mainly compare networks trained on two datasets \"with\" and \"without\" shortcut. This approach also have problems since it requires comparing with a network trained on dataset that is \"without\" shortcut. By defining \"without shortcut\", it also involves domain knowledge and human expertise to detect shortcuts.\n\nBased on the above two points, I think that the propose method have major flaws.\n\nMinor issues:\n\n1). the introduction of estimating mutual information using NTK is vague. For example, what is the definition of $\\Theta(x,X)$? $\\sigma$ is used in Eq.5 but it is written as $\\Sigma$ in Eq.7.\n\n2). Figure legends (e.g. Fig.4) could be more detailed."

To study the training dynamics of shortcut learning, a framework based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) in introduced, able to detect shortcuts and spurious correlations in training data without requiring class labels for the test data.

However, it becomes evident during the testing phase that $I(X_{te}; Z) < I(X_{tr}; Z)$, provided a domain gap exists between the training data $D_{tr}$ and the test data $D_{te}$. Subsequently, equations (4) - (10) are all employed to compute $I(X; Z)$ using well-established formulations from prior literature. Hence, the methods devised are not restricted to the detection of shortcuts and can be applied to data exhibiting substantial domain gaps. I recommend that the authors conduct additional experiments on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.\n\n2. Based on the experiments on partially correlated shortcuts as depicted in Figure 4, I have reservations about the method's limitations when it comes to detecting datasets with partially correlated shortcuts. This is because the hard line in Figure 4(a) appears to be very close to the dotted line in Figure 3(a). I recommend that the authors conduct additional experiments to further investigate the detection of datasets with partially correlated shortcuts."

An example:\n\t- Let's assume a binary label $Y$ and a binary feature $S$, and that $p_{train}(S=1|Y=1) = p_{train}(S=0|Y=0) = 1$, and  $p_{test}(S=1|Y=1) = p_{test}(S=0|Y=0) = 0.5$, which conforms to the Eq's 2 and 3. Also let $p_{train}(Y = 1) = p_{train}(Y = 1) = 0.5$. $Y$ can be odd/even label and $S$ can be the presence of the white patch.\n\t- Then, according to paper's arguments a trained model would learn to reduce the representation of $X$ to the presence of the white patch $g(X) = Z = S$ to maximally compress $X$. In the test set the network would still extract the presence of the white patch from the OOD samples. Why would then $I(X;Z)$ be different under $p_{train}$ and $p_{test}$?\n- Moreover, can the authors definitively claim that $I(X_{test}; Z) < I(X_{tr};Z)$ can only be due to the presence of spurious correlations? If not, how reliable should this method be considered for detecting shortcut learning?\n- The suggested methodology might make sense under some distribution shifts, but it is authors' responsibility to describe and explain this while presenting their method.\n\n## On conceptual clarity and notation consistency\n- The authors do not make clear notational distinctions between random variables and specific values they can take, and use inconsistent notation seemingly without explanation:\n\t- After introducing $X$ and $Y$ as random variables, why do we revert to $x$ and $y$ in Eq.s 2 and 3? \n\t- On Eq.s 8 and 9 why do we have e.g. $X$ and $x$ in the same equation?\n\t- Why is $\\mathcal{Y}$ never explicitly introduced?\n\t- Do $p$ and $P$ refer to different mathematical objects? If so, why are they not explicitly introduced?\n\t- Why is $s$ always lower case? \n\t- Why do we have $X_{tr}$ but not $Z_{tr}$?\n- The generative model implied in Section 3 is not clear, and it's not clear how it relates to distribution shifts in question.\n- Definition 2 is unclear. What is $\\Gamma$? Is it a function that outputs scalar values, such that we can have order relationships?\n- Proposition 1 is not a provable mathematical statement, so it should be named a conjecture or a hypothesis. Even as a hypothesis it is imprecisely stated.\n- Pg. 1: \"A shortcut is a distribution shift...\" I think defining shortcut as a type of distribution shift is both unhelpful and is inconsistent with the rest of the literature.\n\n## On experiments \n- Both in the abstract and the introduction, as well as in the Algorithm 1, the authors propose examining $I(X_{test}; Z) < I(X_{tr};Z)$ as a way to determine presence of shortcut learning, yet in none of the experiments they apply this methodology to decide on this, until Section 5. Neither is this information present in any of their figures before Figure 8.\n- Although deferring some details to the supplementary material is understandable, the authors include no details whatsoever on their experiment setting. This ranges from the used model families to how $Z$ was obtained.\n- The comparison with OOD methods (i.e. how the baselines were used for this task) should be introduced in a more detailed fashion.\n- Figure 2 is a singular demonstration of what the model learns in the presence of strong spurious correlations. A method for quantifying this is needed, in a way that generalizes to other experiments as well."
