Not only in this paragraph, but in many other places throughout the paper, the notations $y, \\hat{y}, f(x), f_\\theta(x)$ were carelessly used, making the paper almost impossible to understand. I believe the paper can be much improved by clearly defining the problem (under which probability distribution the data is generated, which parameter is being estimated, what assumptions are used, etc.).\n\n- Most equations in the paper remain at the level of heuristic. While it is okay to have a heuristic explanation of the proposed method, the way it is presented in the current draft is unnecessarily confusing. For example, how do we even define the limit in Eq. (1)? I think the paper should try to minimize the use of non-rigorous math."

It is said in the paper, that the curvature of the function at x cannot alone explain the stochasticity of the samples which motivate the use of k_3(x). It would then be appropriate to motivate the definition of \"spatial covariance\" by the the \"curvature of x\" and of \"?\" coming from k_3(x).

                "value": "Although the general idea is attractive and, to some extent, promising, the concept is not properly exploited in the article. In this regard, the most relevant weaknesses of the paper are: \n\n- Generally, the paper could be clearer, and its format can be improved. For instance: \n    - the abstract (5th line) defines the mean of a Gaussian as $f(x)$, and the covariance as $Cov(f(x))$. So, it is not clear whether $f(x)$ refers to the RV to be modelled or its mean.\n    - Figs 1 and 2 are not referred to in the body of the paper, and they are not self-explanatory either. To this Reviewer, their purpose is not clear. \n    - Tables span beyond the margins of the text\n    - A few times, it is mentioned that the experiments are run over _multiple network architectures_; however, in the experiments, there is no mention of specific architectures used\n    - gaussian, hessian -> Gaussian, Hessian\n    - axis labels in Fig 3 are too small\n\n- Also, in the line of clarity, the paper is motivated by the pitfalls of maximum likelihood (ML). However, the proposal in the paper results in a specific parametrisation of the covariance, which ties the structure of the covariance and the mean (eq 8 shows how the covariance contains the Jacobian of the mean function). Therefore, the proposal is not _another training strategy_ but rather a covariance parametrisation. As a matter of fact, after eq 8 the authors state that their parametrisation is used alongside ML. \n\n- Benchmarks are unclear: The experiments compare the proposed parametrisation against **NLL** (though the proposed method also uses NLL as far as I understand), **Diagonal**, which I assume also uses NLL and other methods. It is thus confusing if the paper compares approaches to training covariances or models for covariances.  \n\n- Another point worth noticing is the fact that the paper proposes a variance parametrisation and also a performance indicator (C-MAE). However, this is the only performance indicator used in the experiments, meaning that other than the conceptual justification of C-MAE (which I find valid), there is no experimental validation. This means that the authors propose a model and use their own defined metric to assess it.   \n\n- There should be given more details about the choice of $k_1,k_2,k_3$, the networks, and the learning objectives."
