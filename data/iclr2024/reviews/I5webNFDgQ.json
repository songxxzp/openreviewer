DiffusionSat shows strong performance across multiple tasks (super-resolution, temporal generation, and in-painting) on three repurposed datasets."

This allows the approach to leverage an image sequence to address the shortcomings that may be present in any individual image (e.g., clouds). While the underlying temporal transformer was introduced by VideoLDM (Blattmann et al., 2023), its application to remote sensing problems is still valuable.  Further, the proposed method allows satellite image synthesis to be controlled using metadata and text. For example, synthesizing images with seasonality (summer grass vs winter snow), location (France vs.  USA), and ground sample distance.\n\n- The authors introduce a new temporal generation task using satellite image datasets. This task targets common issues with using satellite image sequences, namely that the interval between images is not fixed and that frames can have varying GSD.\n\n- Evaluation is fairly extensive."

                "value": "- Limited technical novelty. \n\n  The proposed method reduces to a straightforward way of embedding metadata and then conditioning a stable diffusion model on said metadata. The temporal transformer component is from VideoLDM. \n\n- Quantitative performance across multiple tasks is strong, but not convincingly better than existing approaches. While the proposed method does achieve SOTA performance on some metrics on some benchmarks, it doesn't show consistent enough performance across the board to substantiate the claim that the method is SOTA on all these tasks, as the introduction indicates.\n\n- The approach and evaluation are limited for multi-spectral imagery (MSI).\n\t\n  This work does not address the issue of varying image band GSD (e.g., Sentinel-2 bands) in MSI, despite claiming to support MSI synthesis. For various remote sensing products, image bands may not all be the same GSD. Some effort should be taken to recognize this occurrence, since 10m -> 1.5m super-resolution is far easier than 20m->1.5m (Sentinel-2 bands 5, 6, 7, 8a, 11, and 12) or 60m -> 1.5m (Sentinel-2 bands 1, 9, and 10) [1] super resolution.\n\n  [1] https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi/resolutions/spatial\n\t\n  The MSI super-resolution problem aims to synthesize 3-band WV3 imagery from 13-band Sentinel-2 imagery. While this may be useful in some scenarios, it does leave out a fairly significantly problem, namely, generating all spectral bands. As such, the method does not really perform MSI synthesis, but rather can support MSI inputs for RGB super-resolution.\n\n- Figure 4 is not informative as the disaster-related damage is difficult to identify. Consider highlighting damaged areas, or use a more clear example.\n\n- Minor editing problems: leftover question mark (page 4), repetitive text (bottom of pages 1 and 3), typo and highlighting on page 8, etc."

Ultimately, I think this paper will have a positive impact on the community.\n\nFor the fMoW super-resolution task, are the super-resolved images multi-spectral or just RGB? The text seems to suggest that the model takes in a 13 band Sentinel-2 image and outputs a reconstruction of a 3 band WorldView-3 image from fMoW. Is the reconstruction limited to just 3 bands (R, G, B)? If so, then the task isn't actually multi-spectral super-resolution."
