In particular, the algorithm receives a prediction of the frequency of input items, and it utilizes this info to build a separate data structure for items with similar (predicted) frequencies via a simple thresholding strategy. Indeed, if this partition of the data is good enough (which means items of similar frequency are put in the same parts), then it can achieve a better accuracy-space tradeoff compared with a generic count-min sketch. Similar ideas have been considered in recent papers such as Vaidya et al. (ICLR 2021) which studied bloom filters."

Items with sufficiently high predicted frequencies have their frequencies tracked exactly, while the remaining items, with low predicted frequencies, are placed into the Count-Min Sketch data structure. In this work, the authors extend this idea and propose the partitioned learned count-min sketch(PL-CMS) where the algorithm partitions the items into multiple ranges based on the prediction. The paper studies how to set the threshold of each range to make the performance of the algorithm better formally (in this paper,  the estimation error metric is different where the authors aim to improve the false positive rate of identifying the heavy items).
