How to evaluate the training efficiency of the proposed StyleCL?\n\nOn choosing the most similar previous task in Section 3.4, why can Eq. (6) be used to evaluate the similarity between the current task and previous tasks?\n\nOn preventing negative forward transfer, why can the sim(t, k) in Eq. (7) be used to signify positive or negative forward transfer? How is the formula $V_{m}^k {}^{*}U_m^t V_{m}^k$. Also, if sim(t, k)>0, then how to guarantee that optimizing the t-th objective will not lead to negative forward transfer on task k?\n\nSection 3.5 is generally not clear. Please elaborate on how to modify Algorithm 1 to handle real-life scenarios without task IDs."

Why all the historical nearest models are omitted in equation (3)? \n\n2.\tThe right side of Equation(7) is a matrix? How to make comparison to zero?\n\n3.\tThe technique about overcoming task ID constraints in lifelong learning setting is not impressive, and some related problems are not mentioned, e.g. How to set a proper number for the mixture of tasks? How to exclusively employ the feature adaptors and latent vectors since we don\u2019t know the task ID? are the historical tasks also have no task ID? \n\n4.\tFigure 4, the t-SNE of the learned latent dictionary shows a lot of points for each task, which is confusing, since the learned latent dictionary for each task is not bigger than K, do the authors use large and different K for each task?\n\n5.\tThere is no analysis about the effect of different dictionary size K on the performance? Which K is used in the experiments? How to select K for a new dataset?\n\n6.\tTable 2, are the backbone for all the compared methods styleGAN2?  Why the performance of GAN Memory here looks much worse than the original paper, where the FID are all below 20."

For example, some or all vectors might be shared across stages or tasks.\n2. The necessity of (shared) feature adaptor is not justified. Including this, authors could do ablation studies to justify the effectiveness of each proposed module.\n3. The claim that \"(the set of bias vectors) captures the relative position of the learned latent subspace in the W^+ space.\" is not justified.\n\n- There is no comparison with baselines in experiments starting from Section 4.4, so not sure if the proposed method/module is really effective. There might be suboptimal or even redundant design choices.\n\n- The paper is overall not well written. The aspect ratio of figures is awkward, e.g., Fig 1 and 2. There are many citation format errors. Please distinguish the usage of \\citep and \\citet.\n\n- Metrics used in Table 2 are never explained, so it is hard to understand what is going on without reading references.\n\n- The reference section requires thorough proofreading, as there are many incomplete/inaccurate references. For example, many references miss the name of the published venue or they are in inconsistent format, e.g., \"In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)\" vs. \"In Proc.
