                "value": "The paper proposes an approach for spatiotemporal modeling using physics-aware causality. The approach integrates domain knowledge with data-driven models to construct more robust and interpretable pipelines. The model learns causal weights from spatially close and temporally past observations to current observations via semi-supervised learning, allowing it to capture the underlying cause-effect relationships in the data. The approach employs a regularization term to capture the causal structures that align with the physics-aware causality, further improving the model's performance. The model's ability to handle noisy and limited data is demonstrated by extensive experiments on time series data, and its superior forecasting performance on real-world graph signals highlights its effectiveness in capturing the underlying physics principles governing spatiotemporal observations. Overall, the proposed approach is a promising direction forward in the field of machine learning, with potential applications in climate, traffic systems, and electricity networks."

The introduction mentions the existence of various physical laws in the real world. However, in the model and specific dataset experiments, these physical laws were not introduced as prior knowledge. I am curious whether this prior was learned or predefined. Moreover, since the introduction (in the second paragraph) states that partial physical laws can be discovered from real-world data, I wonder why no tests on related real data were conducted to verify this claim. These inconsistencies negatively impact the overall coherence of the paper, making it challenging to read. \n\n(2) The paper emphasizes modeling using causal theory. However, learning causal correlations through an MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron) seems somewhat inappropriate. In other words, the causal relationships in the model are determined by a black-box network. This approach might require further justification. While I completely understand the use of attention mechanisms to establish interpretability and correlation, an MLP seems to lack a logical foundation in this context."

To the best of my knowledge, there is quite a large number of literature exploring the integration of physics law or causality into spatio-temporal graph neural networks [1,2,3,4,5,6]. For example, [1,2,6] employ neural ordinary differential equations to capture continuous ST dependencies. Ji et al. propose a physics-guided neural network for spatiotemporal modeling in traffic flows [3]. CaST designs a new framework for handling causality in spatio-temporal graphs [4]. However, this paper lacks a discussion on these studies and doesn't compare the proposed model with them either. What's the difference between them? Why should we use the proposed model? It would be good to survey more related publications before paper submission. What's more, the related work section should be included in the main body of the paper, instead of the appendix.\n2. The technical contribution of this work against existing approaches is not significant, which is clearly below the acceptance level of ICLR.\n3. The term \"causality\" in this paper is questionable. This causality is more similar to proximity in other spatio-temporal graph neural networks [7, 8], rather than the actual causality in causal inference. \n4. The learned causality in this paper lacks justification.\n5. The baselines used in this paper are weak and outdated. Please consider more recent baselines for comparison (see the above references). \n6. This paper lacks the experiment over one of the most popular tasks -- traffic forecasting, which is also driven by inherent physics laws.\n7. No source code for reproducing the results.\n8.
