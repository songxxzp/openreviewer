For instance, it would be helpful to clearly state the purpose of the experiments and analyses in Subsections 4.2 and 4.3.\n\n2. The language used in the paper is quite loose, leading to some confusion. For example, when the paper states that \"Increasing the time step (T) enhances the SNN\u2019s expressiveness,\" it would be beneficial to provide a precise description of \"expressiveness.\" Additionally, the claim that \"increasing the time step leads to an increase in the calculated surrogate gradient error\" requires further explanation. The treatment of time steps in this work deviates from typical learning methodologies for SNNs, potentially causing confusion for readers, as $T$ here does not represent the length of a spike sequence.\n\n2.1. The authors blur this concept here, making it difficult for readers to distinguish existing work from traditional practices.Clearly, the authors seem to aim to bolster the significance of their paper with this assertion. However, it must be acknowledged that this approach is not in line with standard practices, particularly for SNNs. When employing this method, SNNs may not showcase the capability to outperform conventional neural networks. Instead, their representational capacity may be limited to a subset of RNNs.\n\n3. The title of the paper may be considered somewhat overstated. The claim of \"temporal generalization\" lacks substantial support throughout the paper. The assertion of theory verification in Section 5.3 requires clarification.\n\n4. The temporal transformation module introduced in the paper bears similarity to existing concepts, such as multi-step RNNs. Providing a clear distinction or novelty in this module would enhance the paper's contribution."

There can also be more discussion on the compatibility of the layer-wise adaption of time steps and the thought of (asynchronous) parallelism for neuromorphic computing.\n\n2. Theoretical analysis is limited and there are many informal claims. For example, in Section 4.2, \u201cwe believe \u2026 balance between SNN expressiveness and gradient accuracy \u2026\u201d --- what is the formal definition of \u201cexpressiveness\u201d and \u201cgradient accuracy\u201d and what\u2019s the quantitative measurement of them? And \u201cthe new training loss may not converge, leading SNN to jump out of the local minimum point\u201d --- to which loss the \u201clocal minimum\u201d refers and why not converging can certainly lead to \u201cjump out of the local minimum point\u201d rather than move surrounding it?

Compared to naive NMT, MTT urges each layer of SNNs to learn feature that is weakly correlated to input length from the previous layer.

Overall, I believe MTT marks a significant step forward in the right direction."

I'm worried that these datasets contain essentially time-invariant features along the time dimension. Even for CIFAR10-DVS or N-Caltech101, only simple movement of static images is recorded using the event cameras. The authors should validate their methods on those datasets with affluent temporal dynamics, like from DVS-Gesture to audio such as GSC (Google SpeechCommands) or SHD (Spiking Heidelberg Dataset) to strengthen their results.\n\nThe former concern raises the other issue that, mixing different timesteps is partially empirically based on the finding that the temporal gradients resemble each other when timestep stretches or shrinks, and we expect the training will be stable to some extent since gradients are relatively similar. If the input has invariant length and a different amount of temporal information in essence, will the MTT work as it is now?"
