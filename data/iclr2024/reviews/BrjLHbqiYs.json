The semi-supervised setting being investigated contains only labelled unimodal datasets and unlabelled co-occurring multimodal data. The authors derive 2 lower bounds and 1 upper bound for Synergy information - emerged information when all modalities incorporate. Additionally, the research demonstrates how these theoretical results can be applied to estimate multimodal model performance, guide data collection, and select appropriate multimodal models for various tasks."

The authors acknowledge that the synergy bounds are not tight, and that they may underestimate or overestimate the true amount of synergy in a dataset. This is a limitation of any information-theoretic approach to synergy quantification. While the paper provides a theoretical framework for quantifying interactions between modalities, there is limited empirical evaluation of the proposed approach. The authors only provide a proof-of-concept experiment on a small dataset, which may limit the generalizability of the results.\n\n2. The synergy bounds are sensitive to the choice of auxiliary distributions. The authors use a set of auxiliary distributions to compute their lower bound on synergy. The choice of these auxiliary distributions can affect the tightness of the bound. The authors do not provide any guidance on how to choose the auxiliary distributions, which leaves this as a practical challenge for users of the proposed method.\n\n3. The synergy bounds are not applicable to all types of synergy. The authors focus on quantifying synergy that arises from the disagreement between unimodal predictors. However, there are other types of synergy, such as synergy that arises from the complementary strengths of different modalities. The proposed synergy bounds are not applicable to these other types of synergy.\n\n4. The paper does not provide any theoretical guarantees on the performance of multimodal models trained using synergy bounds. The authors show that synergy bounds can be used to predict the performance of multimodal models on held-out data. However, they do not provide any theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of these predictions. This is a limitation of the paper, as it would be useful to know how accurately synergy bounds can predict the performance of multimodal models in practice."

I think authors could have provided more explanations or examples to make the paper more accessible to a wider audience.\n\n4.
