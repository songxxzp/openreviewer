(Possibly, the threshold-based gradient filter cannot properly filter out the adversarial gradients?)\n- The authors argued that the proposed threshold-based consensus guidance mechanism filters out the meaningless adversarial gradients, but when it comes to Figure 4, it seems that those the consensus guidance mechanism cannot filter out those gradients. For example, in Figure 4(f), intervening \"bulldog\" to \"beagle\" should not affect the grass texture since it should not be sensitive to the breed of dogs. It seems that those factors are not perfectly disentangled in the latent or noise space.\n- Definitely, the proposed method is quantitatively outperformed in the CelebA case."
