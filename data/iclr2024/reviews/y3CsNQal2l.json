The authors propose learning adapters that capture 'task ability' and 'language ability' separately and introduce a novel adaptive adapter merging method called AdaMergeX, which is applied to LoRA adapters and IA3 adapters.

Element-wise addition/subtraction is applied to LoRA type adapters and element-wise multiplication is applied to IA3 adapters.\nThe paper examines the proposed method in several cross-lingual transfer tasks and demonstrates that it achieves improved performance."

(See MAD-X as an example, which is not fundamentally different in terms of training data requirements compared to Houlsby nor this work). \n     * The test results are sub-sampled (in paper, \"while for XNLI, XLSum, and XQuAD we randomly sample 1000, 500,\nand 1000 data points from the whole test set respectively\") without convincing justifications.\n\n- Ablations:\n    * Even though differences in results between the same task across two languages approximate 'language ability,' such a claim was not carefully examined or discussed. Are the domains of training data the same for two languages (for the same task)? Was any of the cross-lingual data for the reference task machine-translated?\n    * Why is the ablation of backbone models (Table 6) evaluated on only a single task with two languages? Given that XNLI contains 15 languages, it's unconvincing that the results generalize across languages, especially when prior tables (e.g., Table 2 or 4) show results across multiple languages.\n    * The same question applies to Table 3, where results are only shown for 2 languages (es, fr), and they are not even the same languages as in Table 6 (es, vi). No justifications are provided.\n\n- Inadequate discussions about the proposed work and its relationship to prior work. For example:\n    * the training of adapters capturing language ability skills using 'LM objectives' (equivalent to the reference task in the paper) lacks a clear connection to existing literature in cross-lingual transfer, such as MAD-X and LT-SFT.\n    * insufficient exploration of its relationship and differences with methods like AdaMerge and Task Arithmetics. The LoRA merging in the proposed work involves element-wise addition/subtraction, which is the same as in Task Arithmetics.\n    * imho, one of the core interesting point proposed by the author is different types of adapters requires different merging operation, yet this aspect is not sufficiently studied in the paper. \n\n- Writing:\n    * Details of the experiments, such as the backbone model used for the experiments, are scattered throughout the paper, making it very difficult to follow the experiments.\n    * Definition of AdaMergeX (adaptive) vs AdaMergeX (cross), Eng-Tune vs Eng-FT etc.\n    * There are unclear descriptions of experimental settings, such as of what has been used as reference tasks for specific experiments, including details on the amount of data used and the training process etc."

(2) Baseline setup:  MAD-X[1] adopts a similar idea, and introduces task and language adapters to cross-lingual transfer, which should be the most important baseline. Besides, fine-tune-based cross-lingual transfer methods such as xTune[2], and translate-test[3] should be considered. The setup of the XLT baseline is not clear. If the proposed method uses training data, is XLT evaluated in a few-shot setup as well?\n- The results are insufficient to support the claim \"AdaMergeX consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods\". First, the XNLI accuracy scores in Table 2 are too low to compete with random guess, which has 33.3% accuracy. For reference, mT5[4] achieves 85.0 accuracy on zero-shot cross-lingual transfer on XNLI. Besides, regarding XLT as a SOTA cross-lingual transfer method is misleading because a lot of cross-lingual transfer methods achieve better performance.\n- \"AdaMerge outperforms cross-lingual transfer methods\" is misleading.

The term 'structure-adaptive' adapter merging from the title and the abstract actually denotes the need to perform merging via different operations, which depends on the nature of the chosen adapter architecture: e.g., LoRA relies on elementwise addition, so the same operation should be used for adapter merging, while IA3 requires elementwise multiplication. As the ablations studies show, doing 'blind' merging that doesn't align with the actual underlying adapter structure yields large task performance drops.\n\nThe proposed merging strategy is then applied on several LLMs and mostly compared against other recent (and less sophisticated) merging strategies on several standard cross-lingual transfer tasks, spanning a total of 12 languages. The results show consistent gains over the chosen baselines."

One of the main conceptuals novelties, as claimed by the authors, is the division of information and abilities into 'language abilities' (captured through language adapters via causal language modeling) and 'task abilities' (captured through task-specific tuning). However, while it's interesting to revisit this idea in the context of LLMs, the idea is definitely not novel (see W2).\n\nS3.

The idea of connecting modular and PEFT learning with cross-lingual transfer has been explored before with encoder-only models (a body of work on bottleneck adapters, sparse subnetworks, etc.) as well as encoder-decoder models (e.g., check the work on mmT5). Moreover, even the idea of (simple) adapter merging is not novel and has been proposed, e.g., by Zhang+.\n\nW2. There has been a large body of work that decomposed language and task abilities into dedicated language and task adapters and then performed various operations on such decomposed modules with well defined abilities. Cross-lingual transfer is basically one of the primary applications demonstrating how modularisation helps with postiive transfer. I suggest the readers to check a recent survey paper on modular deep learning of Pfeiffer+ for an overview (e.g., MAD-X work performed exactly this but stacking instead of merging language and task adapters). Overall, the paper doesn't perform a good job in contextualising their work within the wider area where the idea of modularisation for cross-lingual transfer has been extensively researched with encoder-only and encoder-decoder models. This diminishes the novelty of the work substantially.\n\nW3. The gains are reported only over the chosen baselines (which seem most relevant at first), but there's a large body of work on cross-lingual transfer (i.e., with adapters as well as without adapters) that the paper simply ignores. For instance, combining language and task masks as done in the work of Ansell+ (ACL-22) can be seen as a form of direct adapter merging for cross-lingual transfer, and is therefore directly relevant as a baseline. Comparing performance to adapter-based transfer with encoder-only models is also a must, as previous work typically reported much higher absolute scores in general.\n\nW4. The results in absolute terms are quite low - for instance, many XNLI results actually underperform the random baseline (or a majority baseline) in a 3-way classification task such as NLI. The same goes for XCOPA results. There are much higher scores reported on those benchmarks in prior work on cross-lingual transfer learning. Given the reduced novelty and other methods that are very relevant and perform some sort of adapter merging, I fail to see how exactly this approach advances the field.\n\nW5. It is quite intuitive to see that merging adapters via the same technique that merges their parameters with the parameters of the original model will yield the highest performance. While it's nice to see this confirmed empirically, I feel that the paper overclaims this as a contribution (similar to overclaiming the novelty of decoupling learning into language and task adapters). Also, the work only explores adapters that get their parameters merged/composed with the original parameters of the large model, but it doesn't explore other techniques such as bottleneck and serial adapters, or a combination of different architectures (e.g., UniPELT or AutoPEFT).\n\nW6 (Minor). The paper doesn't really evaluate on low-resource languages, but this mostly stems from the limitations of the underlying LLMs that simply cover less languages than models such as mT5, XLM-R, mDeBERTa, etc."

With that assumption authors define a way to train a model on a specific task task and specific language by using another task as pivot to provide the language ability, to provide the task on a different language, and remove the undesired pair pivot task and languages.\nThis idea is adapted into two existing parameter efficient fine tuning methods, LoRA and (IA)3 and tested in a variety of tasks such as multilingual arithmetic reasoning, multilingual common-sense reasoning, multilingual natural language inference, question-answering and multilingual summarization. The method is compared against five cross-lingual transfer competing techniques, which are beaten by AdaMergeX.\nA few ablation studies are presented, showing the generalizability of the approach regardless of the pivot language, using Spanish and Vietnamese instead, and generalizability  in terms of pivot task, comparing the performance using XNLI and XCOPA as reference tasks.\nFinally an experiment using T5 instead of LlaMa model is performed, showing the generalizability  in terms of architecture."

Cross adaptive merging methods is probably a bad idea and your experiments support that.\n\nThe experiments on source language generalizability ? Why choose only 2 languages? Do the authors consider that the experiments on Spanish and Vietnamese make the point?\n\nSimilar question for XNLI and XCOPA for task generalizability\n\nAnd for T5.\n\nDo this approach work on Encoder models as well such as XLM or mBERT?"
