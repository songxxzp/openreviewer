                "value": "This paper presents a method to prune an encoder-only pre-trained transformer-based language model without retraining it. The method is based on the notion of a global importance score for each attention head or feed-forward neuron, considering both the prediction loss (KL divergence between pruned and unpruned models) and the representational loss (L2 distance between weights at each layer before and after pruning). It uses a layerwise pruning of attention heads and feed-forward neurons, starting with the bottom sublayer and working up. In each layer, three steps are performed: 1) Global importance computation: Compute the global importance score for each attention head or neuron. 2) Mask search: Search for a mask for each attention head or neuron, considering both prediction and representational knowledge. 3) Linear projection layer tuning: Tune the linear projection layers for the heads or neurons that are not pruned using a linear solver on a small amount of data. The proposed approach achieves an improvement between 8.5-58.0%p in F1 across tasks/models relative to a training-free approach in Kwon et al. (2022). Compared to the unpruned baseline, the proposed approach achieves an inference speedup of 2.65x, while the method of Kwon et al. gives at most a 1.87x speedup. It achieves comparable accuracy to retraining approaches (such as DynaBERT) with significantly less computation."

The key challenge addressed by this work is the accurate compression of such models without requiring retraining. Existing retraining-free algorithms suffer from significant accuracy degradation, particularly at high compression rates, due to their inability to handle pruning errors effectively.\n\nKprune employs an iterative pruning process that focuses on preserving the valuable knowledge contained within the pretrained model. This process includes three main steps: knowledge measurement, knowledge-preserving mask search, and knowledge-preserving weight-tuning. By implementing these steps, Kprune achieves remarkable results, with accuracy improvements of up to 58.02% higher F1 score compared to existing retraining-free pruning algorithms. These improvements are observed under a high compression rate of 80% when tested on the SQuAD benchmark, all without the need for any retraining."

Unlike prior techniques, KPrune considers both the overall loss impact and the effect on representation preservation when deciding which units to prune. It does this by analyzing the expected output of each head/neuron. As a result, KPrune requires minimal pruning time compared to retraining methods and outperforms previous retraining-free approaches. This work differs from Kwon et al. (2022) in two main ways: 1) it incorporates layer-wise representation loss when measuring unit importance, and 2) it recovers weights by tuning the output matrix with linear solvers. These innovations enhance pruning quality with minimal overhead versus retraining. In summary, KPrune efficiently compresses models while maintaining performance by carefully accounting for loss impact and representation preservation when pruning."
