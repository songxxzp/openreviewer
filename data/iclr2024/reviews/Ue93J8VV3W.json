First, the datasets are merely described, but there is little rationale about why they have been constructed in this way and what qualitative properties they have. Second, and more importantly, the experimental study reports results of some baseline models using fixed (!) hyperparameters, but does not provide any additional insight beyond pure numbers. I did not learn anything from this study.\n\nOn W2. This is more a dataset paper than a research paper. As argued above, the methodology used in dataset construction and, more importantly, empirical study does not enhance our understanding of graph learning.\n\nON W3. The paper positions itself as graph learning with \"tabular\" / \"heterogenous\" features. This raises misleading expectations, as it's really just graphs with a fixed set of vertex-level features.\n\n--- UPDATE AFTER DISCUSSION ---\nI'd like to encourage the authors to follow-up on this benchmark, even though I do not think it is ready for publication at ICLR. I raised my overall score to express this point.\n\nThe current submission (still) misses a solid discussion of available benchmarks and where they fall short, it is not clear if the submission provides SOTA baselines (which are not \"easy\" to beat by subsequent work), it's not clear to what extent feature heterogeneity actually plays any role (e.g., would the result change if the original non-heterogenous datasets were used), and the paper's study lacks insight (including insight beyond Platonov 2023)."
