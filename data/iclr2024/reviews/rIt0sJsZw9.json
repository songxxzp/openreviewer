                "value": "Multi-entity sequences are common in the realm of NLP. However, existing approaches towards deriving entity-specific embeddings are typically only able to construct embeddings for a single entity at a time. The paper proposes a general method for deriving entity-specific embeddings from a multi-entity sequence completely within the transformer architecture. The method showcases SOTA performance on emotion recognition in MELD and EmoryNLP datasets, and on player performance projection task. In addition, the paper proposes a novel distribution-aware clustering method in the absence of labels, which attains SOTA performance in long-tail partial-label learning."

This casts doubt on whether the performance gain could be attributed to the \u201cpre-training\u201d on the target domain.\n\n- The introduction of the player performance projection task, given its relative unfamiliarity, necessitates further clarification. It would be better if the authors could provide some examples of the task, especially in relation to the extraction of entity-specific embeddings from multi-entity sequences.\n\n- The paper concurrently presents two distinct methodologies: one centered on extracting entity-specific embeddings and the other on a distribution-aware clustering approach. Presenting these two methods in the same paper seems unconventional, as it appears the two approaches are tackling different challenges and are not interdependent."

The paper introduces two methods (i.e. deriving entity specific embedding and clustering) that are not highly related to each other. The weak connection of the methods makes the paper difficult to understand.  The motivation for clustering may need clarification to avoid the perception of merging two separate papers.\n3.
