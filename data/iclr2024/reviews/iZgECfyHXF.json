                "value": "This work studies the problem of online nonconvex optimization with single oracle feedback. More specifically, the authors consider three setups of the single oracle: single exact gradient feedback, single stochastic gradient feedback, and single function value feedback. The authors choose local regret on the original function, not on the smoothed version of it as previous works, as the performance measure. The key contribution of this work is that the authors find that the problem-dependent quantity of function variation is a fundamental variable in this problem. Specifically, in the first two cases, the authors give two corresponding lower bounds regarding the function variation for the linear-span algorithm family. And they prove that OGD and OSGD are optimal inside the linear-span algorithm family. In the functional value feedback, the authors use a new running difference gradient estimator and obtain an optimal result inside the linear-span algorithm family. Note that the result under the function value feedback with one-point running difference gradient estimator is as good as that using a two-point gradient estimator."

                "value": "I have only one major concern, which affects my score for this paper.\n\nConcretely, I think some statements of the optimality of the results are a little over-claimed. Note that the lower bounds (Theorem 1 and Theorem 3) do not hold for any possible algorithm but only for a specific family called linear-span algorithms. Although the family of linear-span algorithms contains many famous and widely used algorithms such as GD, AGD, and so on, as the authors have stated, they cannot represent all algorithms. As a result, the lower bounds are only algorithm-related lower bounds. When talking about optimality, it is correct to say that 'our algorithm is optimal inside the linear-span algorithm', but not just 'our algorithm is optimal', as the authors have claimed in the current version. This is a serious issue, and I suggest that the authors could revise the corresponding statements to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings of the paper's contributions. By the way, I think the contributions of this paper are still adequate for acceptance, even if the authors use the correct descriptions of optimality. As a result, there is no need for over-claiming, which will only give readers and reviewers (at least for me) a bad impression."

Or equivalently, does this work offer a strictly superior methodology compared with Hazan's work? If not, what is the disadvantages of measuring local regret defined on the original functions?\n2. Is the one-point running difference gradient estimator strictly superior to the standard FKM one-gradient estimator? I think this only holds in the problem of online nonconvex optimization, but not in bandit convex optimization (BCO)? As the authors have stated, the variance of the one-point running difference estimator is a constant, which is also the case for the standard two-point estimator, and thus the guarantee of this work is as good as that using a two-point estimator. However, is the variance of the running difference estimator still a constant in the BCO setup? If so, it seems that an $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret can be achieved in the BCO setup, which is definitely the most exciting progress in the BCO research (which is too simple to be true). If not, what is the difference between using this estimator in the nonconvex setup and in the convex setup? Will using the running difference estimator in the method of Flaxman (SODA'05) improve their $O(T^{3/4})$ regret? If not, what is the key difficulty?"

Moreover, the paper focuses on single oracle algorithm where, in each iteration, the algorithm can only request one oracle query. Specifically, three oracle models are analyzed in this work: 1. deterministic gradient oracle (SGO) that returns $\\nabla f_t(x_t)$, 2. stochastic gradient oracle (SSGO) that returns an unbiased estimator of $\\nabla f_t(x_t)$, and 3. function value oracle (SVO) that returns $f_t(x_t)$.

I'd like to highlight a few standout results:\n\n- While previous results of ONO with local regret consider window-smoothed approximation $F_t(x)=\\frac{1}{w}\\sum\\_{i=t-w+1}^t f_i(x)$, which may vary a lot from the original loss, this paper works directly on original losses and thus providing a more accurate regret bound.\n\n- The algorithms studied in this paper only makes one single oracle query in each iteration, while most algorithms in prior works require multiple oracle queries due to window-smoothing.\n\n- This paper provides comprehensive analysis for 3 different oracle models. Specifically, it provides lower bounds for the gradient oracle models and proves that online subgradient descent achieves the optimal lower bounds in both cases. \n\n  Moreover, for the function value model, this paper proposes a single oracle algorithm, matching the state-of-art regret bound which is previously achieved by an algorithm making two oracle queries per iteration. The idea of one-point estimator using running difference of function values instead of the standard two-point estimator is novel and interesting.\n\n- What stands out to me the most is the notation of \"function variation over time\", namely $V_T = \\sum_{t=2}^T \\sup_x |f_t(x) - f_{t-1}(x)|$. Similar to the notation of path length in dynamic regret, function variation is also an adaptive measure that captures the difficulty of the ONO problem. Therefore, the proposed regret bounds in this paper (namely $O(1+V_T)$ for SGO, $O(\\sqrt{(1+V_T)T})$ for SSGO, and $O(d\\sqrt{(1+V_T)T})$ for SVO) are always tighter than the previous vacuous bounds in the corresponding settings.\n\n  I also find it interesting how $V_T$ naturally follows from $\\sum\\_{t=1}^T f_t(x_t) - f_t(x_{t-1})$ in the smooth loss analysis, and it just happens to be a tighter measure."

However, all of these work use smoothed version of the loss function (i.e., the average of a batch of functions in a window) when computing the regret, and people typically believed that using the exact function (that is, with window size 1) will lead to a \\Omega(T) regret. However, these bounds are actually worst-case bound, and do not depend on data of the loss functions themselves. That is to say, there must exist simple cases where the regret is sublinear. In this paper, the authors captures this by showing a data-dependnt lower bound (function variation bound) and matching upper bound. This is the first paper that shows both sublinear lower and upper bounds for online non-convex optimization with local regret with window 1, which is a significant and novel contribution, and may inspire future works. \n\n\nThe proof for the upper bound is relatively straightforward and brings to mind what people do when obtaining the function variation  bound  for dynamic regret. The proof for lower bound is much more challenging and require novel techniques.\n\nPresentation: The paper is in general well-written, and easy to read."

See, e.g., (1) of [1], for more information. \n\n[1] Chiang, C. K., Yang, T., Lee, C. J., Mahdavi, M., Lu, C. J., Jin, R., & Zhu, S.. Online optimization with gradual variations. In Conference on Learning Theory, 2012.\n\n> Introduction: One line of work adopted the global regret as the performance metric (Krichene et al., 2015; Agarwal et al., 2019; Lesage-Landry et al., 2020; Heliou et al., 2020), which compares the algorithm output to the global minimum of the nonconvex objective functions. However, accessing the global minimum of nonconvex functions is typically infeasible.\n\nI don't understand this discussion. Regret is a performance metric, and people do not really compute regret when implementing the algorithm. So why \"accessing the global minimum of nonconvex functions is typically infeasible\"?"
