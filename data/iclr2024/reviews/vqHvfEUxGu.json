Rather than using a single agent, it introduces multiple agents that interact with separate environments in parallel. The key ideas are:\n\n- Multi-agent formulation: Maintain a set of N parallel agents, each with its own policy and environment. All agents share a common replay buffer.\n- Collaborative reward generator: Calculate an intrinsic reward for each agent that encourages it to visit novel states not explored by other agents. This induces collaboration and specialization between agents.\n- Collaborative data collection: Agents can also explicitly coordinate during data collection, e.g. selecting diverse actions compared to others.\n  \nThe approach is evaluated on DM Control tasks. Results show improved exploration and performance compared to single agent baselines and other intrinsic reward methods like RND and ICM. The idea of collaborative reward is general and can be integrated with different algorithms."

This seems detrimental, I assume that we're interested in using a multi agent method because we care more about wall clock time than sample complexity, in that case the additional cost to compute the embedding may not be worth it.
