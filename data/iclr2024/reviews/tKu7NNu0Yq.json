Traditional EMD calculations are computationally expensive, so surrogates like the Chamfer distance are often used. To overcome this, the authors focus on computing the point cloud matchings rather than the EMD itself. Experiments show that this model can be used to estimate the EMD faster than using the Hungarian method or Sinkhorn algorithm. The paper demonstrates how the approach can be used to train a point cloud Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using the approximated EMD."

Framing of the problem: The framing of the point-cloud matching problem as learning a cost function is quite intersting and makes me think of a number of applications for which this can be used. The empirical results provided, particularly the comparison against the Chamfer distance, the Hungarian method, and the Sinkhorn algorithm (as seen in Figure 8), is nice. This comparison gives a clear view of where the proposed model stands in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.\n\n\nS2. Clarity: The paper's structure and presentation seem to be well-organized, with the problem clearly articulated. The choice of casting the problem as an estimation of an attention matrix and its relevance is also clear. However, for a reader unfamiliar with point cloud analysis or attention mechanisms, some sections might be dense. A more thorough introduction or background on these concepts could enhance clarity.\n\nS3. Significance: Notwithstanding missing comparisons (see Weaknesses below) I think the proposed model for approximating EMD could be quite useful in a number of scenarios (basically anywhere the Hungarian algorithm or the Chamfer distance is used at the moment). The model's performance, particularly in the out-of-distribution tests, is quite promising. The model also seems to generalize well to larger point-clouds than on which it was trained."

Comparative Evaluation: The paper does not compare its method to state-of-the-art registration approaches. Given that point-cloud registration is a long-studied problem, there are likely several strong baseline methods against which the proposed model should be evaluated.\n\nW3. Generalization may be an issue: While the paper mentions that the model generalizes well to larger point clouds during inference than those seen during training, most of the experiments are carried out on datasets consistent of synthetic 3D models. What happens when this is applied to real LiDAR scans or depth images?\n\nW4. Scalability Issues: Attention mechanisms, particularly in the context of a large number of outputs, can be memory-intensive. Given that point clouds can be large (millions of points), it might be difficult to scale the proposed approach to such cases."

Providing a thorough review of existing methods, especially those that leverage learning-based approaches, will help highlight the contributions of this work.\n \nW2. The authors should compare their approach against leading methods in point-cloud registration, possibly ones from the above list. By doing so, they can better demonstrate the advantages of their method, be it in terms of accuracy, speed, or other criteria.\n\nW4. The memory overhead of the attention-based method should be addressed, particularly in the context of large point clouds. Providing benchmarks for total memory usage would be beneficial."

This has been explored in the literature in papers such as these two papers. The transformer architectures in those papers also predict a matching matrix/scores that is then used to compute correspondences to solve a registration task. The proposed architecture is different from the ones in these papers but from what I can tell, the architectures/models in [A, B] appear to be superior as they allow the ability to deal with partial matching, outliers where the work proposed here cannot deal with such scenarios.\n\n[A] RPM-Net: Robust Point Matching using Learned Features, Yew and Lee 2020.\n\n[B] REGTR: End-to-end Point Cloud Correspondences with Transformers, Yew and Lee 2022.\n\nThe authors claim that their proposed approach to compute EMD approximately is significantly faster than existing techniques. They primarily consider two baselines, the well-known Hungarian method which computes EMD exactly and the well-known method that used entropic regularization to compute approximate EMD (Cuturi et al 2013) using matrix scaling / Sinkhorn Knopp algorithm. It is true that the proposed method is significantly faster than the Hungarian method and the Sinkhorn implementation tested here. However, there are a number of works in the literature which are either variants of the Sinkhorn method that have a better convergence than the original Sinkhorn method [C] or have investigated faster algorithms for computing EMD [D, E] that do not require any learning and therefore do not have the issue of overfitting/failure to generalize. A comparison with methods such as [C, D, E] is needed (perhaps there are a few other works in the literature) to make a stronger case for the proposed method.\n\n[C] Near-linear time approximation algorithms for optimal transport via Sinkhorn iteration, Altschuler et al. 2017\n\n[D] A Fast Proximal Point Method for Computing Exact Wasserstein Distance, Xie et al 2019\n\n[E] Fast Sinkhorn I: An O(N) algorithm for the Wasserstein-1 metric, Liao et al 2022.\n\nThe title/abstract is not particularly appropriate. The proposed approach is aimed at computing EMD-based distance between 3D point clouds of geometric shapes. However, the title of the paper makes it sound like a generic method to compute EMD between arbitrary distributions has been proposed. Morever, the approximation factor in the proposed method is somewhat adhoc and not well analyzed, as some of the existing methods in the literature."
