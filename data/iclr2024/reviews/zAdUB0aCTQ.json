                "value": "The paper proposes a novel benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of a given LLM to act as an agent in a specified environment. In particular, the current benchmark consists of eight tasks belonging to three main categories, namely code generation, game playing, and web browsing. Generally, each environment corresponds to a sequential decision-making problem, and, in some cases, the problems are best represented as POMDPs. The paper then provides a pretty exhaustive evaluation of many state-of-the-art LLMs. The results provide some interesting insights, including showing the status of the applicability of current state-of-the-art LLMs as agents and tasks where GPT-4 lags behind its predecessor, GPT-3.5-turbo."

                "value": "The obvious strengths of the paper are its timeliness and significance. The use of LLMs as agents is a hot topic, and there is a need for benchmarking methods. The authors have put together a reasonably diverse and practical set of tasks and have put thought into creating a scalable and useful benchmarking system that new LLM-based agents can easily use. I would also like to praise the authors on the current set of evaluations, which is pretty extensive, and the authors have covered a lot of publicly available LLMs."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Now, coming to my concerns about the paper, my current worries can be broadly categorized into the following groups\n\nProblem Selection and Quantification: The first issue is with the selection of task domains. The main motivating factor for the authors behind their current selection seems to be potential example scenarios where such LLM-based agents are currently being considered for deployment. While this can be a helpful metric, this approach overlooks an opportunity to curate datasets or even create random problem generators where you can accurately tune the complexity of the tasks being considered (quantified in objective terms such as computational complexity). This could have been done over the current task set (for example, one could quantify the complexity of certain OS operations by looking at factors like the size of filesystems, etc.), but it is currently missing. The current method of scoring each task depends on the abilities of the current set of LLMs being considered and isn\u2019t an objective measure. One potential source for finding task sets where you can objectively quantify task hardness may be considering classical planning and logical reasoning literature. There, you can find many benchmark problems with varying degrees of complexity.\n\nDataset Collection: I was a bit surprised to find out that many datasets used in the benchmark were prepared using large language models, including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. Wouldn\u2019t this potentially influence or bias the results? For example, in the database task, data augmentation was carried out using GPT-3.5-turbo. This was also one of the tasks where GPT-3.5-turbo outperformed GPT-4. Is there any possibility that this is correlated?\n\nEvaluation and Feedback Generation: In the two previous points, I have already pointed out some concerns with evaluation results. Now, I would like to bring up some other points related to evaluation. For one, I don\u2019t know how fair it is to make a blanket claim that, currently, open-source LLMs fall behind closed-source ones when, by the authors' own admission, they only considered OSS models with less than or equal to 70B parameters. I would strongly encourage the authors to rephrase the claim. The evaluation and the benchmark also don\u2019t currently appear to allow any form of task-specific fine-tuning. I didn\u2019t see any discussion with respect to that topic. I also found the authors' choice to do prompt omission a bit surprising. While in the most general POMDP case, the full history of actions and observations is important for fully observable cases, can\u2019t you create a new prompt where the current state of the task (along with any task specification) is fully summarized?\n\nClarity: Finally, the writing of the paper requires a lot of polish. There are numerous typos and malformed sentences littered throughout the paper, and the paper could benefit from thorough proofreading. However, the bigger concern I have is how the authors use certain terms and whether they imply technical meaning to them. There are many examples throughout, but let me point a few instances out. At one point during the analysis, the authors refer to incompleteness. Incompleteness is a technical term used in many areas of AI and computer science, including proof systems and sequential decision-making and planning. Are the authors referring to it in that technical sense? But then the incompleteness is related to the task, which doesn\u2019t make sense from the traditional use of the term. Similarly, the term \u2018turn-taking\u2019 is usually associated with multi-agent games. While this kind of makes sense in the context of chat-based models, the authors use this term pretty liberally, which makes me think the authors may have instead meant to use it in the sense of multiple-step or sequential decision-making problems."

                "value": "- The contributions of the paper seem very limited -- the paper does not propose any new technical insights and simply applies a variety of LLMs on many existing environments.\n\n- The analysis is not particularly insightful and I'm not sure if the conclusions are fully accurate from the analysis. For instance, task length exceeded may just be due to the fact that many LLMs are trained on short fixed context lengths. In setting such as this, it would be better to first summarize the long context to keep inputs in distribution to the input LLM.\n\n- Similarily, the fact that code training helps models is relatively well known. Codellamma performing worse than llamma 2 may just be due to weakness in the original pretrained model that the model is fine-tuned on. Overall, the conclusions in the paper mostly just follow the general trend of the more capable the LLM, the better the performance on the benchmark\n\n- In the related work section, it would be good to also add some references to multiagent approaches to reasoning such as multiagent debate. Also age 2023 seems to be incorrectly formulated.\n\n- Some of the references in the paper are incorrectly cited. For instance, in the intro, Reed et al. 2022 does not use a LLM to learn an embodied policy, a better reference would be [1]. Similarily, Ahn et al 2022 does not use a complex multi-modal simulator based off games but rather a real robot.\n\n[1] Pre-Trained Language Models for Interactive Decision-Making. NeurIPS 2022"

                "value": "1) Have you tried seeing the results of each method assuming a small number of demonstrations to fine-tune each LLM to each domain?\n2) What is the sensitivity of the performance of each LLM to chosen prompts? It seems like prompts used for evaluation are very complex and it would be good to understand how they were chosen and how prompts would effect the performance of each LLM.\n3) Can the authors come up with a method to try tackle all of these benchmarks?\n4) Can the authors explain more why the chosen set of text benchmarks comprehensively evaluate the ability of LLMs to act as agents? For instance, why isn't there a benchmark to test multiagent interaction between LLMs?"
