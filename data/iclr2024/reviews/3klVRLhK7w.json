Frequency-based sampling estimates the similarity between categories and maintains a relatively constant use frequency across samples.

                "value": "- In my opinion, Section 3 needs a lot of work before the paper is ready for publication, because it fails to adequately and clearly explain the two components of the proposed approach. I have personally read this section four times, inlcuding a lot of back-and-forth to the appendix, in order to fully understand the proposed approach. I also think that the pseudocode is too important, and has to be included in the main paper. The same holds for the information discussed in Sections A.2 and A.3. \n- I am not sure I agree with the way the authors measure computational cost. According to my understanding, neural network training can be split in three stages: i) the forward pass, during which we calculate layer activations; ii) the backward pass, during which we calculate layer gradients; iii) the update of the weights. I think that the paper might conflate the backward pass with the weight updates. The proposed approach computes all the layer gradients regardless of the adaptive layer freezing. Hence, the backward pass is always completed in full, and the computational savings might be much less than what they appear at first glance (please correct me if I'm wrong).\n- I think you should include another section in the appendix, where you discuss in detail the memory sizes (number of instances) you use in all your experiments. I would also appreciate a more detailed description of the calculations behind the memory sizes (with examples). \n- I found the ablation to be incomplete, as it only includes the Gaussian setup (but not the disjoint), and it does not examine the Vanilla+Freezing approach (i.e., with random retrieval).\n- The paper does not include any wall-clock time comparison to further reinforce their comparison with respect to FLOPs.\n- There are multiple issues with the references (i.e., duplicates, references with incorrect publication status)."

In all tables, you always bold the highest mean accuracy of each column, but I think that you should only bold when the difference is statistically significant. \n- Do you train the model only with data sampled from memory or do you also use stream observations (e.g., like in ER or MIR)?\n- Did you compare your freezing strategy with a naive freezing strategy (e.g., one where you determine the freezing cutoff layer at random)?\n- Why do you use only the gradient of the last feature layer in Eqs. (4) and (6)?\n- You write \"We evaluate the methods in [...] a newly proposed Gaussian task setup for boundary-free continuous data stream (Wang et al., 2022d; Koh et al., 2022).\" However, Wang et al. adopt the setting of [1], while Koh et al. propose a periodic setup that is different from [1]. Could you clarify which setup you are using?\n- In Algorithm 1, line 22, there is an acronym \"B-FIUC\" which I did not encounter anywhere else in the paper.
