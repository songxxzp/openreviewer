Are there any distribution shifts (for instance, something like a black-friday regime, a change around covid lockdowns, etc)?"

Is the model randomly initialized? Given the effectiveness of the baseline one-fits-all model, an exploration into using pre-trained language models as initialization might be helpful.\n4. It remains unclear whether deep learning benchmarks such as N-BEATS, Autoformer, and FEDformer are only trained on designated training sets. Exploring whether similar performance improvements could be achieved by training these models on the pre-training set, using the same loss function, might offer deeper insights. This also helps determine the source of the proposed model's performance gains\u2014whether from the architecture itself or mostly from expanded datasets."

The paper establishes the groundwork for studying pre-training and scaling of time series models and identifies a promising architecture for the task. This architecture serves as a strong zero-shot baseline and exhibits further improvements with increased model and dataset size.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Lack of Novelty: The paper's approach is primarily centered on training a large transformer model on an extensive time series dataset, which may not offer a novel contribution to the field.\n2. Limited Analysis of Transfer Learning: The study raises concerns regarding the assessment of transfer learning, as the model is trained on one dataset and tested on a similar one without sufficient information about their differences. This makes it challenging to interpret the extent of transfer learning within an in-collection setting. Additionally, the diversity of time series within the CloudOps datasets remains unclear, which could lead to potential overfitting issues, particularly for large models.\n3. Inadequate Baseline Model Details: The paper lacks essential information about the baseline models, including their model size and training duration. For instance, while DeepAR emerges as the second best method in Table 5, it is uncertain if its number of parameters is comparable to the proposed transformer models. A comparison with DeepAR models of similar scale and training iterations would provide valuable insights.\n4. Limited Improvements in Larger Models: The paper reveals that the gains achieved with \"Large\" and \"xLarge\" models are not significant when compared to the base model size. Particularly, the \"xLarge\" model, despite being over eight times larger than the base model, exhibits only marginal improvements. This suggests that the base model may already be overfitting the datasets."
