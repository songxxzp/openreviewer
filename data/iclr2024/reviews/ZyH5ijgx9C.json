Rather than increasing the number of layers trained by stacking them like in Progressive or Gradual Stacking, the authors propose to sample a subnetwork of the full network during training randomly and progressively increase the subnetwork size (while scaling outputs appropriately), which allows evaluation during training.\nThey show empirical improvement for the same FLOPS over other stagewise training techniques, as well as a theoretical study of the change of the losses when changing stages.\n\n[Edit: following my comment, I am increasing my note from a 3 to a 5 for the various improvements and clarifications provided by the authors, and may increase further to a 6 following discussions with the other reviewers.]"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**Improvement** The experimental results do not show a consistent improvement of the method over the other stacking methods. Table 1 and 2 show very limited improvement in some cases, for the same value of FLOPs; for schedules that have been chosen by unclear means.\n\nThe results in Table 3 are also surprising. RaPTr does show an improvement on Tydi QA and SQuADv2 other Stacking, but not for the other metrics. The alternative schedule is not detailed and merits more introduction. It is impossible to compare Stacking with RaPTras as long as Stacking has not been trained with this alternative schedule, or a similar one. (This could be done by training the entire model with 30K steps, then training only the first layers, and restacking the previously trained layers to extend the model, rather than stacking the same layer). Otherwise, the improvement due to RaPTr seems relatively small without this schedule. The small variance claimed by the authors is only proven with the alternative schedule and not RaPTr in general. \n\n\n**Notations** All along the article, the notations of the schedule of RaPTr are very inconsistent and unclear.\nThe schedule $T^{1:k} \u00d7 (p^{1:k}, I^{1:k})$ is never used after its definition if I'm not mistaken. This is logical as it is often useless: $I$ is denoted to be the entire set during all of the experiments, and the stage times are always equal. Only $p$ ever changes during the experiments. Similarly,  The sense of $I$ reverses during the paper. At first, it defines the set of fixed layers before seemingly being reversed during the experiments as $I$ is the entire set $(1,24)$ (which is also not consistent with the claim that the first and last layers are always fixed). $I_s$ in Algorithm 1. is not defined and just seems to be $I$. \n\n**Schedule** The way schedules are chosen is never clear. In the experiments, the whole set of layers is used for $I$ with equal the same number of steps in every stage. Why is only $p$ varying? In Table 2, the stages are defined as 6-8-10-12 for RaPTr and 6-9-12 for stacking for BERT-base, and then once again equal for BERT-Large. Why were they different at first?\n\n**Section 4.2** is extremely unclear. The normalization is very dependent on the initialization, however, the choice of initialization is never discussed. Similarly, the experimental values during training compared to initialization are not discussed. What we are supposed to conclude from Lemma 4.3. is not clear at all.\nIn particular, the link between Section 4.2. and the experimental results in Table 2. are unclear. The goodness of fit of Fig 2.b seems pretty low. The sentence \"$\\Psi^l$ increases slowly with $l$\" is surprising considering that the value decreases until $l=21$. Many claims do not seem to make sense or are never explained: \"suggesting a worse-case bound of $O(L^{\u22120.88})$\" ? What does \"A simple calculation shows that the gap between a $L\u22121$ random subnetwork and the full model scales as $O(L^\u2212c)$ for some c \u2265 0.5\" mean?\n\n**Novelty** The technique proposed is very close to other layer-dropping techniques, in particular of Zhang et al. 2019, which also aims at reducing the FLOPs needed for the training. The main difference is that the dropping is done at the start of training rather than the end, and the different rescaling.\n\n**Figures** The Figures either bring very limited information or are very hard to read. Figure 1 could have been substituted by a simple Table. Figure 2 is never referred to anywhere. Figure 3 is extremely hard to read and never really explained well.\n\n\nThis article thus brings limited novelty or improvement to other methods and is often very unclear. As I have trouble understanding Section 4.2, I am for now keeping my confidence at 3 in case I am just misreading this Section."

                "value": "\"The intuition is that since the first and last layers play different roles\": This seems logical. This does ask the question of whether not only the first and last but $k$ first or/and $k$ lasts layers may need to be fixed. Are the early or later layers more important to be fixed?\n\nI don't really understand why the experiments on BERT are qualified as \"short horizon settings\".\n\n*Errors or remarks:*\n\n* Introduction: \"Gradual stacking (Gong et al., 2019) and Progressive stacking (Reddi et al., 2023)\", the order is reversed, it should be Progressive for Gong et al. and Gradual for Reddi et al.\n\n* Sec 2: \"the computed based\"\n\n* Figure 1.b. \"for fixed set\" -> \"for the fixed set\" \n\n* Table 2 is quite unclear.
