The framework models the intensity function (of time) as a summation of event-triggered trajectories, each of which solves a neural ODE with an initial state that depends on the time of each event and its mark. The additivity of event-triggered trajectories on the intensity function allows us for the efficient parallel computation for model training and the explainable analysis of the dependence between events, which is the advantage over previous neural network-based Hawkes processes."

But Dec-ODE demands to solve ODEs to compute integrations, which is generally more time-consuming than Monte Carlo integrations needed in conventional methods. In Experiment, there are no comparative analysis about computation time (sec/iter), and the authors\u2019 insistence about computation efficiency remains to be verified. \n- The authors insist that an advantage of Dec-ODE over conventional methods (e.g., Yang et al., 2020) is the explainability due to the decoupled structure. But the decoupled structure has been adopted intensively in the literature, which were not in the benchmark models in Experiment. To verify the insistence, the authors need to compare Dec-ODE with references with the decoupled structure, which would make the pros/cons of the proposed model clearer.\n- RMTPP is a standard benchmark model in the literature, and should be included in comparative experiments. Otherwise, the authors need to mention the reason for not including it. \n- The explanation of the experiment setup seems to be inadequate for reproducibility. The details of neural networks (e.g., activation functions) and the machine spec used in the experiments should be shown.\n- The detailed equation about how to compute the derivative of the likelihood regarding model parameter is not shown.\n- Discussions about the limitation of the proposed model are not in the paper.\n- To the best of my knowledge, there are sentences that seem technically inaccurate as follows, which raises a question about the paper\u2019s quality:\n\t- [3rd paragraph in Section 1] the authors introduce neural Hawkes process (Omi et al., 2019) as a marked temporal point process (MTPP), but the Omi\u2019s paper did not consider the marks of each event. Also, there are two Omi\u2019s papers (2019a and 2019b), but they look identical.\n\t- [2nd paragraph  in Section 2] the authors explains that the modeling of intensity function is preferred over the pdf $f^*(t)$ due to the complex dynamics of $f^*(t)$, but the complex dynamics depending on the past events is not limited to $f^*(t)$.\n\t- [2nd paragraph in Section 2] $\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} f^*(s) ds = 0$ is correctly $\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} f^*(s) ds = 1$.\n\t- [3rd paragraph in Section 2] the sentence \u201c$\\\\mathcal{N}_g = \\\\{ t_i \\\\}$ is a temporal point process\u201d seems to fail to explain the definition of $\\\\mathcal{N}_g (t_N)$ in Eq. (2). Do the authors mean that $\\mathcal{N}_g (t)$ is a counting process?\n\t- [Eq. (9)] the definition of $f_{\\theta}(h,t)$ is not found.\n\t- [References] The authors of Transformer Hawkes process are not Yang et al., but Zuo et al."
