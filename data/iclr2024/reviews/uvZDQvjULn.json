                "value": "GOAL: Study Controlled Language Generation Models (CLM) through the lens of RL\n\nOVERALL/The Main Point:\n\nThe main point of this work is to point out that CLM is basically a biobjective RL problem. They then show that this insight helps by using an RL trick in the CLM context. The trick does improve results (compared to treating it as a simple RL method). It is unclear whether reframing as an RL problem helps compared to these two baselines:\n\n 1) other methods finetune the LLM per control code but do not frame the problem in an RL manner.\n\n 2) The same RL trick used in this paper used to update the policy, vs only using the trick at controlled decoding time (and no finetuning involved). This baseline is needed since the RL trick used in this paper actually also exists in in other controlled decoding papers: https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.57.pdf)\n\n\n\n\nOTHER CONTRIBUTIONS:\n1. Frame 3 variants on CLM problems as off policy RL that has to max both likelihood of behavior policy and reward score of reward model. This means we can minimize the KL divergence of the target policy and the behavior policy + exponentiated reward. (I\u2019m not clear to me why the reward is exponentiated, other than for math convenience in Eqs 5 and 6)\n2. Frame off policy RL as a bi-objective function with a necessary Pareto frontier. \n    - Discuss tT=heoretical outcomes of 2 and empirical justification of some properties in a simple 10-turn position game.\n3. Reward Dropout is an RL trick that keeps only the top %ile of rewards to guarantee improvement based on Pareto improvement condition. They show that using this RL trick helps controlled generation as motivation for why an RL framing of the CLM problem is useful."

            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The experimental results in Section 5 does not provide surprising or insightful results. Even the translation to LLM concepts doesn\u2019t provide insight. The takeaways are that we do better when the two rewards have more overlap (so have a wide span of vocabulary and use an LLM over a smaller model) and when the two rewards have similar maxes (so line up your two rewards by training on data that fulfills both objectives). The visualization is cute, but the takeaways are already standard knowledge (bigger models do better, OOD tasks are harder). If the intent is to empirically test your proofs, then can you write this section in terms of when a policy  becomes a uniform policy (4.2), or show the pareto frontier across policies with the same reward etc. etc. The connection between 4 and 5 is weak.\n\n2. [PRESENTATION]  I\u2019d put a minimal version of Appendix D.2 in the main text -- enough to understand the set-up without reading the full Appendix.\n\n3. Also this set-up described in Appendix D.2 doesn\u2019t really allow you to modify the first part of \u03b2(\u03c4 ), and I feel that to keep with the spirit of this being a bi-objective RL problem, it should be possible to get different rewards from that first part of \u03b2(\u03c4 ).\n\n4. [PRESENTATION]  The decoding method is quite expensive, as it involves updating the params of the entire LLM for each target objective (finetuning to be polite is one entire fine-tuning, finetuning to be a negative sentiment is one entire fine-tuning). A lot of CLM methods have the same model be able to output language under different control codes. Can you call this out more explicitly in the limitations section (because it doesn't come across until you read the Appendix)\n\n5. [SOUNDNESS] For the NLP experiment, I\u2019d like to see a non RL-motivated baseline method. The random dropout isn\u2019t really a baseline. It\u2019s nice that this trick from RL translates nicely here, but does the RL framing allow you do better than other CLM methods trained on those datasets? (ex: Perhaps FUDGE as another classifier guided CLM method, or better yet, Diffusion LM adapted to this task perhaps.).\n\n6. [SOUNDNESS/NOVELTY] The last section (the NLP experiment) is strikingly similar to: https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.57.pdf I'm actually not sure there are any differences except that they don't then re-train the policy (please highlight the other differences for me if they exist). Do you do better than this paper (them only using the method as a controlled decoding solution, and your version fine-tuning based on the controlled decodes)? (A positive answer to this question would also help motivate your RL framing where the policy is typically updated).\n\n7. [NOVELTY] Framing Controlled Decoding as an RL problems has been implicitly done before: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09492"

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. In Eq 4, why is the reward function exponentiated? Why does this make sense in context of the problem (and not only because it leads to nice cancellations in successive equations). \n\n2. How is R computed for each sentence?\n\n3. Are there other RL tricks you believe would be useful? Adding those here (and beating CLM baselines AND comparing the effect of updating policy with the trick vs only controlled decoding with the trick) would better help make the case for the utility of the RL-perspective empirically. As is, I'm not convinced this framing is marginally more empirically useful.\n\n4. My own main weakness as a reviewer is that I may be undervaluing the theoretical contributions here. Other works have already referred to controlled decoding as an RL problem, but they do not have your proofs. Either discuss why the theory alone is a solid contribution  (Why is treating CLM as an biobjective RL problem -- as past papers do --  is an unsafe assumption without these proofs established) OR make the case that the RL perspective is useful empirically (See Question 3)"
