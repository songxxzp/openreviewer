It over claims to \"significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods by 5.2% and 4.2% on the respective benchmarks.\" This also weakens the motivation, as the authors believe that the data augmentation is inadequate in countering data corruption, leading to the proposal of CSI. However, it turns out that CSI performs worse than certain data augmentation techniques.\n    - In Table 1, `PCT+CSI` achieves an ER of 18.4 in ModelNet40-C, which is clearly inferior to `PCT+PointCutMix-R` (16.3) and `PCT+PointCutMix-K` (16.5). These two configurations are from the method [3] that originally introduces the ModelNet40-C dataset. I observe that the authors perform the experiment with `PCT+PointCutMix-R+CSI` in Table 2, but the comparison is unfair because it involves comparing `A+B+C` against `A+B`, and the overall improvement is minimal (0.4%).\n    - Similar observations can be found in Table 2 of the Appendix, where `PCT+PointCutMix-R+CSI` fails to outperform `PCT+WOLFMix`.\n\n---\nReferences:\n\n[1]: Pointwise Rotation-Invariant Network with Adaptive Sampling and 3D Spherical Voxel Convolution.

The authors should compare with other SOTA train-time methods under the same settings in the main experiment, such as data augmentation or modules addition to the model.\n3. The authors present the SEM method for Global Feature in Table 5. Given that the authors are making a critical point selection, what is the purpose of this?\n4. The experiments should consider including datasets not based on ModelNet40.\n5. Tables 1 and 2 in Supplementary show that CSI cannot effectively handle point dropping (e.g., occlusion) and transformations (e.g., rotation), and may even be harmful. Does this indicate the limitations of CSI in terms of generalizability? Therefore, the reviewer points out that the results derived from the ModelNet40-C can be misleading.\n\n[1] Zheng, Tianhang, et al. \"Pointcloud saliency maps.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2019."
