And to the best of our knowledge, the FID score is lower (=better) with the stochastic sampler in the high-NFE regime. Even though the dynamically varying phi(x) looks sound, there is not enough evidence of the design of phi(x). Specifially, it will be better if there is some reasoning with the superior performance of ER-SDE-5, compared to other designs.\n\n* What is the phi(x) of ER-SDEs used for experiments in ER-SDE-Solvers of ImageNet64?\n* Could you compare your method to other sampling methods, such as PNDM and DEIS?\n* What does the 'step' in Figure 3 stand for, in both FEI coefficients and FID scores cases? It seems that the steps stand for the sampling step within the whole 200 steps of the reverse process, and the number of function evaluations (NFE) for FID scores.\n\n* In my opinion, some of the large-scale results in the appendix better explain the benefits of using this ER-SDE-Solver than small-scale results.
