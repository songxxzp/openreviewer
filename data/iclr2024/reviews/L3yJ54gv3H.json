In particular, the estimation result shows that ConvResNeXts achieves a rate of error convergence close to the minimax rate."

What insights do we get from the analysis that requires using ConvResNeXts?\n\nSecondly, I found the definition of Besov spaces too dense and, hence, difficult to understand. Perhaps a few examples would help, as well as a more detailed account of how such spaces generalise Sobolev and Holder spaces, which are known to a wider audience."

                "value": "While both the approximation and generalization results seem novel, it is not clear to me whether the derived bounds are interesting in the context of learning with convolutional networks. In particular, it seems that the approximation results hold just as well for standard feedforward networks, and the main contribution of this work is transforming these bounds from densely connected networks to convolutional networks. The work relies on a result stating that any feedforward network can be reformulated as a convolutional network. Given this result, this just means that any property that holds for feedforward networks holds to some extent for a conv-nets. The property of approximating smooth functions on a manifold seems to be just a particular case where this argument applies. Conv-nets are typically used in cases where they display significant benefits over densely connected feedforward, and I believe this should be reflected in the theoretical results. I think the authors should clearly state the following:\n1) Which of the results in the paper also apply to feedforward networks?\n2) For the results that apply to feedforward networks, which of them are novel to this work? E.g., is the approximation bound on smooth functions on a manifold has been already established for feedforward networks?\n3) In which results there is an actual benefit for using a convolutional networks compared to feedforward dense networks?\n\nAnother more minor issue is with the presentation of the approximation and generalization bounds. If I understand correctly, some of the constants in the bounds have exponential dependence on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold, and it is interesting to show this dependence explicitly.\n\nMinor:\n- Definition 6: there seems to be a typo, with some unclosed bracket.\n- Bottom of page 5: \"hyperparameters parameters\" should be just \"hyperparameters\"?\n- Top of page 7: \"our This\""
