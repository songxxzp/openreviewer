                "value": "The appendix and many parts of the main paper very severely lack polishing to the extent that communication is difficult. Many of the proofs look more like a first draft than a serious submission. In particular, I can't vouch for the correctness of any results past Theorem 3.1 (which is not 100 percent correct either. In addition to poor language and presentation, the organization of the paper in terms of which assumptions are made is not good. The paper just needs more calm work and rewording: the authors of the appendix appear in a rush. \n\n\nHere are more details: \n\nFirst, although this is a minor point, it is worth mentioning that the constants in Theorem 3.1 don't seem to be fully correct. Indeed, the proof relies on a combination of Lemma 1 and Lemma C.3 from the arXiv version of [1], with both theorems relying on excluding a low probability event. Since combining both results requires a union bound, all the $\\delta$s should be changed to $\\delta/2$, resulting in different constants throughout. The same issued shows up in the proof of Proposition C.5. Note also that the result cited from [1] in Lemma C.3. is not in the published version, but in the arXiv version only. There are no Theorems 2 and 3.2 in the NeurIPS version, THis is Theorem 2 from NeurIPS and Theorem 3.2 from arXiv (\nHowever, the same result can be lifter from [3] instead.) In addition, the combination of both results should be done explicitly since the constants are wrong again due to not applying the union bound. Also, I am really not sure the authors are actually using Theorem 3.2 rather than a simple generalization bound in terms of VC dimension. \n\n\nTheorem 3.4 makes sense as a statement (though I couldn't check the full proof), but is very hard to read and contains plenty of minor errors. Why is $z_i(A)=argmax...$ unique? It seems the authors mean to say that $z_i\\in argmax....$. When defining $\\mathcal{M}_i$ as \"the set of gobal minima in $C_i$\", the authors actually mean that $\\mathcal{M}_i$ as a set is the argmin of the objective function over $C_i$ (in particular, the elements are \"global\" minima inside the partition element $C_i$, but not necessarily global minima for the whole problem). This is absolutely not clearly written. It is also not clear why a different definition style is used for $|mathcal{M}_i$ and for $z-i(A)$ in that case Every statement in this paper is written vaguely using words instead of maths, adding to the burden of trying to make sense of what is attempted here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==================Minor comments============\n\n\nWhat is Theorem C.2 a restatement of? It seems it is Theorem 3.1 but it is not written (only the title \"restate\"). \n\nThe wording of transitions  is quite sloppy. For instance, in page 14 we have the sentence \"In order to give a fine-grained analysis, we follow the common choice where a two-layer NN function class is widely analysed in most literature, i.e. Neural Tangent Kernel, rich regime, random feature models.\" What do the authors mean by \"rich regime\"? \n\nNote also at the top of page 14, the integral is not properly written as I believe the authors actually meant to write $\\int f(x)g(y) \\tau_d(d(x,y))$ instead of $\\int f(x)g(y) \\tau_d(dx)$  (otherwise the quantity is just equal to 1). \n \n\nThe statement of Corollary 3.2 is not really mathematically well defined. What the authors mean is that the bound from Theorem 3.1 converges to the RHS of equation (3), but what is written is just that the OOD generalization error is bounded by it. The \"proof\" is not very clean either. \n\nThe second sentence of Theorem 3.1 should contain a word such as \"assume that\". \n\nThe description of the case where $K=1$ above corollary 3.2 seems quite dodgy as it implies that the loss is approximately constant in the whole of input space! \n\n\nNote that even the definition of one of the main concepts of this paper, i.e. robustness as in Definition 2.2, is not very well introduced: there \"for all\" which relates to $s,z$ is duplicated, and there is a \"for all i$ after the $forall $s,z\\in C_i$ (which depends on $i$). This makes this much harder to read than necessary. Note that the definition in [1] is much cleaner. It should be copied more faithfully. \n\n\n\n====================Typos====================\n\nThere are plenty of issues with the language, not only in terms of improper use of grammar to an extent that harms understanding, but also in terms of polishing, spelling and punctuation. Below is a highly non exhaustive list. \n\n\nIn the abstract, fourth line \"sharpness of learned minimum influences\" should be \"the sharpness of learned minima influences\" \n\nPage 2: to the left of the figure, \"as shown in \\cite... that when the loss lanscape...\": a coma would be better than \"that\"\n\nEvery theorem which is lifted from a reference involves the text of the name of the authors written twice (once manually and once via the \\cite function). This is probably due to copy and paste from another template with a different citation style without checking through it again. (prop. 2.1, definition 3.3\n\nPage 21, \"under this case\" should be \"in this case\" \n\nEquation (44), there is an equal sign with three bars instead of 2 where I think the authors actually mean equality in the strict sense. \n\nLine 3 of Section 3.1 \" $(K,\\epsilon)$-robust\" should be \"..robustness...\"\n\nIn page 5 (theorem 3.4), there is a \"w.p. a\" which probably should just be \"w.p.\"\n\n\nThere are plenty of \"w.r.t\" and \"i.i.d\" (missing period) throughout the text. \n\n\nIn appendix D, note the use of \"where definition of ....please refer to the corollary 3.5\" \n\nIn page 18 at the beginning of the proof of Lemma D.1, although I agree that equation (29) makes sense, the sentence which introduces it speaks of the smallest eigenvalue whilst the equation itself shows the equivalent statement expressed as an PSD inequality between matrices. \n\nJust below equation (27), it is unclear what the authors mean by saying that \"$\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{F}\\Delta \\mathcal{F}}$ represents the algorithm\" WHat algorithm? \n\n\n====================References===========================\n\n[1] Robustness and generalization.

                "value": "Could you write down a proof of  Proposition C.5 clarifying if you are using a standard VC bound or Theorem 3.2 from arxiv [1], and fixing the constants from the union bound? \n\n\nDo you stand by your proof of Lemma D.5? It seems sloppy to the point of being completely incomprehensible, though I believe a similar result probably holds. Is equation (46) an equation or an approximation ? It seems that the probability (LHS) should be equal to $2\\phi/\\pi$ and not involvea $cos$ at all. For equation (47), it seems that you are calculating the bound the wrong way around: equation (47) holds if the inequality is reversed inside the probability statement. In the next substantial revision you upload, could you also include a precise restatement and citation for \"Robbin's bounds\".\n\n\nWhat is going on in Equation (64)? The statement of Theorem 3.4 appears to be agnostic w.r.t. the choice of loss function, but the proof says \"ohh we can verify that this holds for common loss functions such as L1, MSE, MAE etc.'. How do you get the first equality in (64), and does it hold for all loss functions? Please rewrite the proof accordingly. \n\nCould you fix the \"definitions\" in corollary 3.5? When taken at face value, I maintain that $L_{x^*}=0$: there is something missing there. Also, although I guess that $\\hat{w}_min$ is the minimum absolute value of any entry of $\\hat{w}$ this is not clear from the definition since the notation $|\\cdot|$ to mean element wise absolute value is non standard. \n\n\n \nPlease rewrite all the proofs much more carefully and upload a revision.

Comprehensive evaluations involving transformers, ConvNet, CLIP, and BERT  trained on larger datasets such as ImageNet and MNLI reveal a weak correlation between sharpness and generalization. Surprisingly, a consistent negative correlation between sharpness and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization suggests that sharper minima might actually generalize better, contradicting the authors' proposed theory. Moreover, experiments in [6] indicate that the choice of sharpness definition heavily depends on the specific dataset. To substantiate their theoretical claims, it is essential for the authors to conduct more extensive experiments on larger and more intricate datasets using complex models.\n\n-\tNumerous studies propose that flatter minima might offer better generalization for both standard and out-of-distribution (OOD) data such as [7] and [8]. However, traditional sharpness definitions often fall short in capturing generalization accurately, potentially because they are not consistent under reparametrizations that do not change the model itself.

                "value": "- Why conducting partition on all training data is still not clear to me. It is reasonable that a small distribution shift in the same sub-group could lead to noise and should be ignored. But how such a strategy is formulated is unknown. Besides, could it be possible to conduct an ablation study to justify that such kind of partition is indeed helpful for OOD generalization?\n- The results in Figure 4 are interesting. However, some intuitive explanations are missing. For example, why did the test error of the worst-case group first decrease along the correlation probability and then increase?\n- It would be much more helpful if the authors could provide the experimental results on larger datasets such as DomainBed and WILDS. I understand theoretical papers could still have gaps in realistic application, but it would be helpful for us to find problems and look for possible directions."
