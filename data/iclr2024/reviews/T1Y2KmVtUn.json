The central proposition is in learning task-specific pixel layout parameterisation. To this end, this paper proposes a sensor simulation framework that allows end-to-end training, and  a pixel layout parameterisation. Initial experimentation confirms performance benefits on learned layouts over classification, semantic segmentation and multi-label classification."

How effective is it in covering a variety of scene structures with only two parameters (theta_1, theta_2)?\n- [Exp. on computational cost] In Sec. 2 (in paragraph [End-to-end Optimization of the ISP pipeline]), the authors mention that the proposed model can reduce the size of the network and the training time, so further experiments on the computational cost of the proposed method are needed. \n- [Comparison with non-uniform] The authors conduct experiments comparing their method to other method (Zhao et al., 2017) using a uniform layout, and additional experiments comparing their method to other method using non-uniform layout are needed. (Marin et al., 2019)\n- [Exp. on different object size] In Sec. 5 (in paragraph [Semantic Segmentation]), the authors argue that rectangular layout is learned to put more pixels towards the left and right edges because of a higher density of small objects on the sidewalks and to confirm this effect, experimental results based on the class of small objects near the horizon or accuracy in dense area is required to support this effect. \n- [Exp. on different resolution] The authors run all of their experiments at a lower resolution, but a comparison with experiments at the original resolution along with the computational cost is needed as well."
