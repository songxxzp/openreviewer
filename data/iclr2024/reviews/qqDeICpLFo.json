The accuracy for a two-layer (simple) graph convolutional network without non-linearities is also explored, and the formula for the accuracy conditioned on the graph structure is provided, specifically for a single node.\n\nThe paper concludes with an extensive set of numerical simulations, benchmarking various graph neural networks on the contextual stochastic block model and on other standard benchmarks."

In Wu et al, the authors also noted the ineffectiveness of nonlinearities (in particular ReLU) in Appendix K1, which may also give rise to much of the results of Theorem 2 in the current paper under review.

There seems to be some transpose or dot missing when taking the inner product of vectors (eg - mW should be either m^\\top W or m \\cdot W).\n- Pg 4: Second bullet point of Theorem 1. What is the notation y[X], is it the same as y(X)? \n- Pg 4: Third bullet point of Theorem 1.

Graphs sampled from SBMs are naturally dense (number of edges of quadratic order of number of vertices). \n- Equation 7 (page 14). The first derivative is also 0 when n_in = n_out (is it possible for some setting of the cSBM such that n_in = n_out with high probability?)
