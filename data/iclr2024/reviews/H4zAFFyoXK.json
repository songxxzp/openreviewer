Toward this, the authors propose to align the speech and text modalities through a method they call \u201ccontinuation writing.\u201d The key idea is to first use text input to generate text continuation, and then train an adaptor to predict the same continuation when the text is replaced with its corresponding speech input. The authors show that this simple strategy shows strong results on several tasks such as ASR, translation, and SLU. Analysis also reveals that this strategy helps to align the latent space of speech/text prompts for the same instruction, and push apart different instructions."

                "value": "1. Arguably the biggest strength of the paper is the simplicity of the proposed method. There are no complex training strategies, nor the requirement of large amounts of hard-to-obtain data. The authors keep the largest components of the model (the speech encoder and the LLM) frozen and only train a small modality adapter, and this is done using publicly available ASR training data. As such, the BLSP method should be easy to replicate and use for downstream applications.\n\n2. The authors have performed detailed empirical evaluation on several tasks: speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST), and spoken language understanding (SLU). While their model does not beat single-modality baselines (e.g., on ASR, the WERs are much worse than whisper-small, and on ST, the BLEU is worse than a cascade of ASR+LLM), it is still promising and reminds one of the early days of end-to-end speech translation. I believe with better modality adapters and training strategies, this method may get close to or surpass cascaded approaches.\n\n3. More importantly, on the SLU task, BLSP outperforms a cascaded system since semantic similarity is sufficient for this task. This is an important take-away if this method is used to provide a common interface into a general-purpose QA system, which may only need to be semantically correct to provide accurate responses."

                "value": "### Loss of speaker and paralinguistic information\n\nSpeech contains much more instruction than just its transcription, such as speaker, emotion, etc. Using paired ASR training data for modality alignment forgoes this extra information, and simply marginalizes over them. As such, the resulting model may only be good at tasks which worked with text inputs (i.e., recognition and semantic tasks). If we are extending an LLM with another modality, a natural requirement may be to extend the capabilities of the model \u2014 for example, for vision-language models, image understanding is usually achievable, which is not possible with text-only LLMs. But this kind of \u201cextension\u201d is not shown in this setting. It would have been great to evaluate the model on a non-semantic task (such as emotion recognition) which is not possible using text-only LLMs. This may be an adversarial task for this kind of training; in Section 3.1, the authors conjecture that \u201cthe LLM should behave the same no matter whether it is given the speech segment or its transcripts as input,\u201d but this may not always hold.\n\n### Regarding representations of modalities\n\nIn Section 2 (Figure 1), the authors find that training the modality adapter only on the ASR task is not beneficial since the input speech representations remain the same regardless of the task instruction used, meaning that the corresponding tokens are not being attended to. This is not surprising: the model only learns transcription since that is all it sees in training. Perhaps it would learn to attend to the instruction if the authors trained using a combination of different instructions, such as ASR, translation, and SLU, and also paraphrased the instructions themselves. The resulting model would still not be as good as BLSP, but would not see the representation collapse we observe in Figure 2.\n\nAnother common concern about joint speech-text training usually has to do with sequence lengths. Speech models usually need aggressive downsampling because of their large sequence lengths and redundancy of semantic information. For ASR, usually the speech-text length difference is solved using either cross-attention (e.g. LAS) or alignment-free training (e.g., CTC). For the BLSP model, the modality adapter takes the speech encoder representations, and transforms them for input to LLAMA, which is trained on autoregressive text decoding. Therefore, we expect the adapter to transform the speech representations to the same space as LLAMA input representations. In the paper, the authors used simple speech inputs not containing long pauses, so fixed-length subsampling worked well for them. However, in real scenarios, users often speak with pauses, or correct themselves, and so I wonder perhaps it would be a better idea to use variable-length subsampling techniques in the modality adapter [1].\n\n[1] Y. Meng et al., \"On Compressing Sequences for Self-Supervised Speech Models,\" 2022 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT), Doha, Qatar, 2023, pp. 1128-1135, doi: 10.1109/SLT54892.2023.10022991.\n\n### Empirical results\n\nWhile the BLSP performance on ST and SLU is reasonable and promising, the degradation for ASR is quite large (Table 3). In particular, LLAMA may already have seen the audiobooks from LibriSpeech, or transcripts of the TED talks from TED-LIUM 3, so I expected these WERs to be much lower. The authors suggest (in Table 4) that this is mainly because of the nature of LLAMA to produce fluent text output (probably because of the prompt used). I have two questions about this:\n1. Can the authors show WER results only on rare words to see if important words are transcribed faithfully (without caring about stop words)?\n2. Did the authors try different prompts to see what is the lowest WER that can be achieved? For example, from an application perspective, it may be very useful to have one model that can generate both verbatim and non-verbatim transcripts simply by using different prompts."

In Section 4.4, the authors show multilingual capabilities of the trained model even though the modality adapter is only trained with English ASR data. This suggests that the transformation from speech representations to corresponding text is the same (or similar) across all languages. Can the authors measure this isomorphism among spaces more carefully, perhaps using some of the techniques in [2]?\n\n[2] Marchisio, Kelly et al. \u201cIsoVec: Controlling the Relative Isomorphism of Word Embedding Spaces.\u201d ArXiv abs/2210.05098 (2022): n. pag."
