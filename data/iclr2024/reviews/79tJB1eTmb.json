This addresses a key limitation of existing few-shot prompting approaches: the nature of the task is not known in advance in the real world, making few-shot prompting approaches suboptimal. Meta-Cot involves two steps: i) given the test question, identify one out of k hardcoded scenarios supported by the system (e.g., that the question is symbolic and requires a binary answer), and ii) select in-context examples for the scenario. The fetched scenario is used to run inference with the LLM. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show promising results."

                "value": "- The central claim of generalizing to new questions with a generic prompt is not fully substantiated, as the system only supports 6 hardcoded categories and shows suboptimal performance in out-of-domain scenarios. Additionally, the datasets labeled as out-of-domain (OOD) are not genuinely OOD. For instance, while CSQA and GSM are considered in-domain, CSQA v2.0 and ASDiv are deemed OOD (it is worth noting that using GSM prompts for ASDiv is a common practice). Finally, the OOD performance is suboptimal, with only ASDIV (1 out of 5) datasets showing any gains.\n\n- Regarding the experimental results, Table 3 presents GPT-3 and GPT-4 numbers from MetaCot (the proposed method) together, which could be misleading. Comparison with the gpt-3.5-turbo-based method (AutoCot) shows that the gap is 0.5 points. Comparing this with the data requirements that the proposed method imposes brings the approach's utility into question. Overall, the experimental results are weak and do not justify the rather complex setup used for sample selection. \n\n- The paper reports 89% with GSM-8k. However, this number is with GPT-4, which has been fine-tuned on GSM-8k. Further, the number of GSM-8k without any finetuning is 92% ([gpt-4 technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf))."
