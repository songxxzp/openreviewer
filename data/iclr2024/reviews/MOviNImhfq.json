Specifically, the paper presents a Smoothed Graph Contrastive Learning model which leverages the geometric structure of augmented graphs to exploit proximity information associated with positive/negative pairs in contrastive loss. This enables the significance of node pairs to be adjusted. Furthermore, a graph batch-generating strategy that partitions the given graphs into multiple subgraphs is also proposed to facilitate efficient training in separate batches. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed framework."

A persuasive demonstration of why misaligning negative pairs is harmful should be provided.\n3. The smoothing method only employs the original graph information. However, the node relationship can be highly changed after augmentation. For example, two highly related nodes can be dissimilar when one of them is dropped. In such cases, is the proposal still efficient?\n4. The proposal seems incremental - the smoothing technique, loss function and subgraph generating can be easily detached from the framework.\n5. Can previous contrastive objectives be used in the proposal? There is a lack of ablation studies to exclude the effect of the proposed contrastive objective.\n6. A time analysis should be provided to verify the efficiency of the proposal."

The author dedicates a substantial portion of Section 3 to background knowledge, occupying a significant amount of space, and only begins to introduce the proposed method towards the end of Page 5. This has resulted in an insufficiently detailed experimental section. It is advisable for the author to trim down the content in Section 3 and allocate more space to the experimental aspects of the paper.\n- The author fails to provide the rationale and intuition behind using the loss function as depicted in Eq.4. This loss function does not appear to be particularly innovative. Additionally, I believe that the choice of lambda is crucial, but the author does not explain how lambda is selected.\n- The experiments in this paper seem overly simplified, and the dataset splits chosen do not align with commonly used splits in self-supervised learning (public split). The selection of baselines appears outdated, and the reported results in the paper do not align with the results reported for these baseline methods in their original sources."

However, according to the definition of cross-correlation, $C$ should be an $F\\times F$ matrix rather than an $N\\times N$ matrix, which contradicts Equation 5. I would recommend the author to double-check this issue.\n- In Equation 4, when $i\u2260j$ and $\\hat{\\pi}(i, j) = 1$, Eq.4 assigns a high weight to minimize $c_{ij}$. This seems counterintuitive because $\\hat{\\pi}(i, j) = 1$ should imply that nodes i and j are very likely to be false negatives, so $c_{ij}$ should be maximized rather than minimized."
