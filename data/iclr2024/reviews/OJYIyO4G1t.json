            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Many claims in the article have not been reasonably explained.\n\n     a. The rationale behind the benefits of low-dimensional node representations within the OCL context for enhancing model interpretability is not adequately elucidated.\n\n     b. The reason behinds the integration of the autoencoder framework into one-class classification models is not well illustrated. In page 5, authors wrote \"If we only use the L1, all instances will converge towards the center, regardless of whether they are interest nodes, as the GNN aggregates representations at each iteration. Therefore, we propose multi-task learning with additional loss functions to assist our main task solved by L1, combining the loss functions.\" Such explanation is too high-level, and the underlying mechanism why autoencoder is beneficial to one-class classification is still unclear.\n\n      c. The paper presents the challenge of combining GAEs and hypersphere loss functions, which it appears to resolve by simply combining these functions without a detailed explanation of the challenges involved.\n\n      d. The paper attempts to address the hypersphere collapse problem in one-class classification using low-dimensional representations, but this paper does not sufficiently discuss the advantages of lower dimensions compared with existing solutions. Furthermore, the explanation of why lower dimensions enhance interpretability remains unclear.\n\n2. The writing of the article is not professional enough. In introduction, author wrote \"encapsulating the interest class around a single point in the learned space with a minimum-radius hypersphere can yield erroneous results for unseen data\".   However,  this paper does not respond it in the introduction section, even in the paragraph discussing the proposed method OLGA.\n3. The choice of comparison algorithms in the paper is not sufficiently novel. For example, the OCSAGE method, which uses GraphSAGE, was introduced in 2018, and deep one-class classification was also proposed in the same year. This lack of innovative comparison algorithms diminishes the paper's contribution.\n4. In the reference literature, there are too few articles from conferences such as ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. A more comprehensive reference selection from these esteemed conferences would enhance the paper's credibility.\n\nOverall, the current version does not meet the acceptance criteria of ICLR."

This raises doubts about the accuracy of the author's description.\n\n2.There is a scarcity of comparative methods in the paper, and recent research is underrepresented. Out of the six comparative methods, three are derived from the same paper.\n\n3.The third motivation point mentions \"the methods' lack of interpretability and visualization.\" Nevertheless, the paper itself lacks corresponding theoretical explanations.\n\n4.The paper lacks a complexity analysis of the proposed method, both theoretically and experimentally.\n\n5.In Formula 8, there are three hyperparameters. Unfortunately, the paper does not include a sensitivity analysis for these parameters, making it difficult to intuitively gauge the effectiveness of the design module.\n\n6.The innovation of the author's method appears limited, as it seems to be based on GAE and two MSE losses."
