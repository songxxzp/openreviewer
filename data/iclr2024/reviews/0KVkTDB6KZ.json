The goal is to reduce global loss while satisfying several constraints: (1) Roughly equal loss/accuracy for each individual client; (2) Fairness at each individual client, i.e., low local unfairness; and (3) Local unfairness at each client is also roughly equal to global which reduces to \"equal\" unfairness at each client, i.e., equal local unfairness. The MCMOO problem is addressed by breaking it down into a three-stage optimization process where some of the stages are constrained optimizations. The approach to solving MCMOO has several interesting ideas that involve cleverly controlling the direction of the gradient such that certain other metrics do not increase.\nExperimental results are provided on a synthetic dataset, Adult (2 clients), and eICU (11 clients)."

Or, at least discuss some scenarios where it would diverge.\nFor instance, there are also impossibility results on group fairness in federated learning in: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11333 \n\n3. The word Egalitarian is a bit confusing here. I would think Egalitarian would mean equal accuracy/loss across clients. But, in addition to that, there is also a group fairness criterion with local and global fairness constraints. Using the word \"group\" fairness at places would make it more clear.\n\n4. For what class of fairness metrics would the algorithm work? Please comment.\n\n5. Could the authors also elaborate on the communication cost when there is a maximum since to obtain the maximum also one needs all the values?

Right now it feels more like two fairness considerations are both important, so we will consider them simultaneously. Is it possible to provide some real-world examples or use cases?\n\nW2. Fig. 1 (a) is too hypothetical to support the claim that poor model could impair data generation capabilities and worsening the performance gap over time.\n\nW3. Is there any trade-off or correlation between the Matthew effect and APSD/TPSD? For example, if we only improve the Matthew effect, the accuracy of poorer model might increase, and it may further help reduce APSD/TPSD. Is it possible to show empirical analysis about it (e.g., ablation study)?\n\nW4. In Definition 1, $f_k(h)$ is constrained to be no larger than $\\epsilon_b$, and $\\{f_k(h) - {\\bar f}(h)\\}$ is also constrained to be less than $\\epsilon_{vb}$. Is it possible that enforcing these two set of constraints could hurt a fair local client? Consider a case where the global model is almost perfectly fair, $f_k(h) \\approx 0$, but violate $f_k(h) - {\\bar f}(h) \\leq \\epsilon_{vb}$. Then it might be possible to increase $f_k(h)$ (i.e., making it more biased) to enforce $f_k(h) - {\\bar f}(h) \\leq \\epsilon_{vb}$.\n\nW5. In several places, the authors mention that existing works cannot narrow the gap between worse-performing clients and better-performing clients. I don't understand why the claim is true. For example, minimax-based solution will always minimize the worst-performing clients so naturally it could reduce the disparity among different clients' performance. Is it possible to elaborate the reason more clearly?\n\nW6. It feels a bit conflicting that the authors say minimax cannot narrow the gap among clients' performance but still solve a minimax problem in stages 2 and 3.\n\nW7. Is there any analysis to show the convergence of the proposed method? The authors simply claim it can obtain the convergent solution.\n\n--- Post Rebuttal ---\nI appreciate authors' efforts to address my cocerns, and I have updated my score."
