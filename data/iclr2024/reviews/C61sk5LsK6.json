In conjunction with training on all data towards the end of training, the scheme is able to reduce training cost by about 20-40% on a range of datasets and architectures, including some large scale ones such as ImageNet and a LLaMA model.\n\nOverall, this is a simple but highly pragmatic and practical approach. The scheme solely relies on quantities that are computed during training anyway, so incurs minimal overhead. Unfortunately, I believe that the comparison with the baselines is not entirely applies-to-apples and there are some minor issues with the write-up, so that all things considered I would lean towards rejecting the paper. Nevertheless, I hope these will be addressed over the course of the rebuttal and am open to increasing my score.\n\nEDIT: the extensive additional results for the rebuttal have addressed my concerns and I would now recommend acceptance."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* The comparison with the baselines does not seem entirely apples-to-apples to me due to the \"annealing\" period on the whole dataset. I suspect (intuitively and based on the ablations in Table 4 plus the pruning rule seemingly being irrelevant in Table 5) that ensuring the total length of the optimization trajectory remains comparable to that on the full dataset (by rescaling the gradients) in conjunction with the fine-tuning on all data towards the end of training is the \"secret sauce\" to making a dynamic pruning method perform without a degradation in test accuracy. I'm not familiar with the (Raju et al., 2021) paper, but would expect that at least the annealing period could be incorporated into this method without further issue. At the moment the paper presents its selection rule leading to performance matching that of full-data training as a core contribution, however if this can be achieved relatively easily with other selection techniques as well, I think it becomes more about the re-scaling/tuning as general purpose techniques and the cost comparison between different selection approaches being featured more prominently. I don't think this would worsen the paper at all, although it would change the key takeaways a fair bit and I think it is important that the latter accurately reflect the empirical results.\n* On a related note, I am a little bit concerned that the hyperparameters on e.g. ResNets for CIFAR10 are not tuned for achieving the final test performance as quickly as possible. I think it would be worth adding a baseline that trains on all data with a reduced number of epochs/learning rate decay milestones but increased learning rate corresponding to the computation saved by pruning (so hypothetically for 20% saved computation, train for 80 instead of 100 epochs but with learning rate 1.25 instead of 1 and halve it after 40 instead of 80 epochs). This is to ensure that pruning approaches meaningfully speed up training rather than benefitting from slack in the canonical hyperparameter choices for benchmark problems.   \n* I don't entirely follow what the theoretical analysis is trying to achieve in 2.3. Isn't this just showing that the soft-pruned and rescaled gradient is unbiased? Isn't this completely obvious from having independent Bernoullis multiplied onto the terms of a sum (the total gradient over the dataset) and the expectation of a Bernoulli being its probability (so that if we divide by the probability, we get an expectation of 1 and the sum remains unchanged)?\n* I found the paper to be fairly different to what the title made me expect. \"Info\" and \"lossless\" imply a connection with information theory and lossless compression to me, which is of course not present in the method. I appreciate that this is entirely subjective, but would suggest reconsidering the title of the paper. In particular, I would argue that the \"lossless\" part is a bit misleading since this is not theoretically guaranteed by the method, but merely and empirical observation in the experiments. Of course matching performance to the full dataset can always be achieved by letting $r \\rightarrow 0, \\delta \\rightarrow 1$, but this would remove any cost savings.\n* Similarly, I think the paper overstates its relationship with coreset/data selection methods a little bit. These are generally not for speeding up an initial training run, but subsequent ones e.g. for continual learning or hyperparameter tuning and typically incur an upfront cost. On the contrary, the proposed method speeds up a given training run without producing any artefacts (a coreset) that are useful downstream. So to me this seems more like a curriculum learning paper (although I am not particularly familiar with this branch of the literature, so this is a somewhat speculative statement)."

As much as possible for Table 1 and ideally Table 2 (ResNet-18 instead of 50 is perfectly fine if that makes it more realistic). My hypothesis here would be that all baselines will match InfoBatch in discriminative performance, which would necessitate the main claims in the paper being updated (again, I don't think this affects the value of the contribution). If all the baselines are already using annealing and rescaling, this point is of course void.\n* Add a full data baseline with reduced epochs as proposed in the weaknesses.\n* Is there anything more to section 2.3 than showing unbiasedness?\n* I would be curious what fraction of the data are soft-pruned throughout training? With the losses being bound below by 0, I would expect the distribution to become quite asymmetric as training proceeds. Could e.g. the median or some percentile be preferable? The median (not sure about arbitrary percentiles) can be computed in linear time, although I don't know if it is possible to update it online as for the mean.\n* Do you have any thoughts on how to set $r$ and $\\delta$ on a new dataset/architecture? The benchmarks in the paper are of course well-studied, but I think it would be a nice addition to the paper to discuss some heuristics for finding close-to-optimal values without needing a full training run (although suboptimal values already present a cost saving of course).\n\nTypos:\n- p1, \u00a73: \"constrainT computation resources\" -> \"constrainED computation resources\"\n- p1, \u00a74: \"cubersome\" -> \"cumbersome\"\n- Section 3.3, \u00a71: \"see appendix\" -> missing specific reference\n- B4. last \u00a7: \"bond\" -> \"bound\""

This raises several concerns: (i) As the wall clock time of UCB and InfoBatch in Table 2 are both 10.5h, is this value taking the annealing process into account? (ii) Regarding Table 1, all the baselines and InfoBatch are compared under the same dataset pruning ratio. I wonder whether this is a fair comparison when annealing is involved in InfoBatch. (iii) Why did the authors utilize annealing only as a means of stabilizing the optimization, rather than leveraging the full dataset at the very beginning of optimization when we know that the early epochs of training can heavily influence the convergence of the loss landscape [1]?  \n- The authors may need to provide further clarification regarding how annealing contributes to the stabilization of the rescaling process, especially if it does not seem to significantly impact the variance of the results in Table 4.\n- The authors claim that the use of loss values in pruning conditions serves two purposes: (i) it reflects the learning status of samples, and (ii) it theoretically ensures unbiased gradient expectations. However, in Table 5, it is observed that even a random pruning criterion achieves nearly the same performance as the original pruning condition. This result raises questions about the necessity and effectiveness of using loss values as a pruning criterion and may require further discussion or clarification in the paper."
