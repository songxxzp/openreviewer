However, under W4A4, all methods (including QLLM) cannot achieve a reasonable accuracy. Take Table 1 as an example, the W4A4 LLaMA-65B accuracy of QLLM is only 59.83% (average), which is even lower than the FP16 accuracy of LLaMA-7B, which is 62.23%. The huge drop in accuracy makes the setting impractical. On the other hand, the proposed method does not outperform existing work like OmniQuant under higher precisions (e.g., W6A6). Therefore, it is questionable whether the proposed method has a practical advantage. \n2. The proposed disassembly and assembly method will lead to inevitable inference overhead when there is LayerNorm or activation functions, since extra layers are inserted in the the forward graph (also confirmed in Table 4, 27% overhead compared to INT8 under context length 256, which is negligible). Furthermore, it is unclear what kind of configurations (e.g., disassembly ratios) are used for the INT8 setting in Table 4, since there is no accuracy number reported under this setting. If we use a larger disassembly ratio, will the overhead be larger?\n3. It seems from Table 6 does directly updating the quantized weights (i.e., QAT) is always better than the LoRA tuning. Does it mean if we have enough GPUs for parallelized fine-tuning (e.g., FSDP), we should use QAT for the best accuracy?"

This ensures a more balanced activation range, facilitating accurate quantization and improving the performance of quantized LLMs. The authors also introduce channel assembly to maintain the original channel count by merging similar channels. Additionally, they propose an adaptive strategy to determine the optimal number of disassembled channels for each layer, based on minimizing the reassembly error. The proposed QLLM method achieves accurate quantized models efficiently, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 datasets. For example, QLLM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 7.89% on average accuracy across five zero-shot tasks for the 4-bit LLaMA-2-70B model, trained within 10 hours on a single A100-80G GPU."

Then the channel-reassembled network is more suitable for activation quantization. Finally, QLLM adopts LoRA training with block-wise reconstruction error as the objective to restore performance.

I think implementing W4A4 kernels on some NVIDIA GPUs and demonstrating better efficiency-algo. perf. trade-off compared with W8A8 and existing W4A4 will make this paper stronger.\n* Table 4 shows QLLM has inference overhead compared to methods without channel reassembly. Does this overhead come from the additional disassembly and assembly layers for non-linear layers? A thorough breakdown of this overhead for differently-sized models (larger models, more compressed models such as 4bit) will help illustrate whether the method is really practical.\n* As the channel-assembly process introduces additional approximations, only applying the channel-disassembly process results in the best perplexity (which is shown in Table 2). So, to further demonstrate the necessity of applying channel assembly to keep the channel number fixed, the authors can show the inference efficiency when using the expanded channel number (only apply CD).\n\n**About the algorithm performance**\n* I'm curious how much influence the reassembly process still has as the training data amount goes up. I.e., do the authors compare with using only reconstruction-based LoRA tuning without CD, CA, and CP, under exactly the same training settings but maybe with more calibration data (e.g., 256 instead of 128).\n* A suggestion instead of a weakness: To raise more interest in using this method, I recommend doing some evaluations on chat models."

The main solution proposed is to disassemble an outlier channel into T channels, therefore, the magnitude of each channel becomes 1/T of the original channel. In order not to increase the computational cost by too much, the second part of the proposed method is to search for similar channels and merge them by averaging the activations and summation of the corresponding weights. As a result, total number of channels will be the same as the original tensors after these channel disassembly and assembly steps. Furthermore, a LORA/QLORA-like tuning is applied to greatly alleviate the cost of PTQ while enabling simultaneous tuning of multiple blocks, which is critical to improve model performance (perplexity). Finally, the inference benchmark results show that the proposed method will add ~20% overhead compared to INT8."

                "value": "1. Table 2 shows \"Channel Disassembly only\" approach with just 1% of channel expansion ratio can already achieve comparable results with the final method. In fact, the reason to use channel assembly is mainly to reduce the computational cost. Author may want to add some comments or examples regarding the overhead incurred by this 1% extra channels, in order to justify the need for Channel Assembly method.  \n2. The paragraph of \"Inference efficiency\" as well as Table 4 didn't specify whether this \"FP\" model is FP32 or FP16. If it's FP32, author may also want to include FP16 results since FP16 is used as the baseline on accuracy tables. Also it is understandable that the implementation for INT computation may not be optimized. Therefore, instead of comparing the absolute run time, it would be helpful to include the additional Ops of QLLM compared to INT8."
