The neural tangent approach is of course different from this asymptotic approach, but the main idea should be the same. \n\nThe experiments have room for improvement.\n1.

When showing the out-of-distribution transformation results it'll be great to compare with those methods. The current results in the paper are more like ablations of the proposed augmentation and ensembling technique. It is not clear where it stands with other architecture-agnostic equivariance methods. (even if the proposed method does poorly compared to those it'll be good to have those results)\n\n2) The author claims data augmentation is the only alternate method to bring equivariance in a non-equivariant model. I'll refer these papers [1,5] to the authors where they show that equivariance can be achieved using symmetrization and canonicalization. It'll be nice to include those as well in the paper. Especially symmetrization is closely related to the idea of ensembling because you pass different transformations of the same image throughout the same network before you average. My intuition is that symmetrization keeps the architecture the same and transforms the input, whereas the current work keeps the input the same and learns a transformer version of weights or each of the networks learning to process different transformations of the input. It'll be great if the authors can shed some light on the connection and discuss architecture agnostic body of work.\n\n\n[1] Puny, O., Atzmon, M., Ben-Hamu, H., Misra, I., Grover, A., Smith, E.
