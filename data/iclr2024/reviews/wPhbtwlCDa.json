The proposed family is based on a strong definition of regret and is defined such that it allows to estimate both an upper and a lower bound on such difference, so that similar functions are guaranteed to also yield a similar policy ordering. Also, the mathematical definition is simple and can well be applied both theoretically and empirically."

Each column corresponds to a different metric family, and each point is a different choice of either the metric $m$, the norm $n$ or the canonicalisation $c$. But what is the None column? Are the choices of $m$, $n$ and $c$ consistent throughout different families? Although I appreciate the space constraints imposed by the venue, I really feel that some details on how these are chosen should fit into this section, as these are crucial to properly assess the proposed results.\n- I think it would have been also interesting to assess the individual impact of the choice of $m$, $n$ or $c$ when the values of the other is fixed: for example, how important is the choice of the canonicalisation $c$ w.r.t. the chosen metric and norm? Although there is some discussion w.r.t. this at the end of page 8, it is a bit difficult for me to relate such discussion to the results in Figure 1."

Comparison is provided to previous work, namely EPIC and DARD. The authors define \"canonicalization function\" as a collapsing of reward functions equivalent under potential shaping and S'-redistribution. Interestingly C_EPIC and C_DARD are not canonicalization functions under this distribution because they do not consider S'-redistribution. STARC is then introduced as a class of metrics defined by a canonicalization function, norm, and metric satisfying various properties. STARC metrics crucially are defined relative to the environment, meaning they are implicitly parameterized by S, A, T, lambda, and the initial state distribution. Value-Adjusted Leveling (VAL) is provided as one example construction of a canonicalization function. The paper proves that all STARC metrics are both sound and complete, providing both upper and lower bounds on worst-case regret, and that any sound and complete pseudometrics are bilipschitz equivalent to STARC metrics. Experiments are conducted on both small MDPs, where strong correlation between STARC-VAL and regret is demonstrated, and in a MuJoCo environment."

The experiment in Reacher demonstrated that STARC-VAL produced the correct (expected) ranking of rewards. \n\nThe work is significant because reward function evaluation separate from policy optimization is an important issue in the field, and the work demonstrates that existing methods have issues which STARC resolves.\n\nThe paper is well-written and very clear."

Is it meant to be used to compare two learned rewards? How does the value influence a ML system designer's decision on what to do next? \n\nIn section 2.3, the authors argue for why they think the dependence on T is meaningful. I think it is missing a discussion of the sim2real setting. Does it require a simulator with the true transitions, or simply samples from the true transitions? If the former, I would argue it is a meaningful limitation for many real world tasks due to the sim2real gap.\n\nIn Reacher, the authors acknowledge that estimating the metric via sampling involves summing over absolute values which makes all noise positive, thus inflating the metric for PotentialShaped which should have 0 distance. Indeed in table 1, the distance values are not linearly related to what I'd want the metric to say. The authors argue it is not problematic for ranking, which I agree with, but it is crucial for absolute evaluation (as opposed to ranking), which I think is also important. The paper is missing a discussion of absolute evaluation, as well as a discussion of how big an issue they expect this to be for environments in general. \n\nThe authors claim to provide a complete answer to the question of how to measure distance between reward functions, but I'd argue completeness requires providing a tight bound. We're not sure how large the spread L to U is.\n\nThe authors also acknowledge the theory assumes finite S and A and uses a strong definition of regret."
