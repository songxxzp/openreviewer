The authors then propose a method based on meta-learning to perform novelty detection in GCL, which achieves some performance improvements."

The single-modal streams (i.e., S-Num and S-Vis) seem to be less informative, since the considered datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, CINIC-10) are relatively simple and widely-used in continual learning. \n2. The most primary concern is that, although I appreciate the idea of multi-modal stream, it requires large pre-trained backbones for feature mapping and artificially synthesizes the projected features. Since the variation of learning-gaps usually happen in data space, although they are then projected to feature space, such \"natural variation\" and the proposed \"artificial variation\" may not be consistent. In other words, the proposed benchmark may not reflect the realistic dynamics. Besides, the pre-trained models are usually adapted through prompting or other adaptation techniques, which potentially enlarge this issue.\n3. The proposed method requires meta-learning on a dummy stream, which potentially assume that the data distributions of meta-learning and GCL are similar. Have the authors considered the dissimilar scenario?\n4. The authors claim that they beat current state-of-the-art CL approaches, which might be too strong. They have only compared with three classic baselines and achieve moderate improvements."

This paper tries to include as many \"contributions\" (Benchmark, transformation space, transformation method, new novel detection method, new sampling method, etc.) as possible, making it very hard to tell whether all contributions are of high quality. I am not sure whether all claims are well supported by experiments and details since there are too many claims in this paper, but the ablations are not well organized to support each claim. \n\n2. About the method, it said that \u03b1MetaSup trains a dummy learner on the Digital classification setting (S-Num) and then uses it on S-Modal. Why would this meta-learned learner be suitable for the complex S-Modal setting? Just as indicated in Table 1, S-Num (MNIST and SVHN) and S-Vis (CIFAR-10 and CINIC-10) settings are much easier than S-Modal (DomainNet, IMDb and Amazon). I do not think the conclusion from this meta-transfer result is universal for GCL.\n\n3. In the experiments, it is reported that \"Meta-Sampling improves performance by as much as 10.5% and 9.6% on S-Num and S-Vis.\", \"\u03b1MetaSup augmented baseline ER performs 8% better.\"  How do these numbers be obtained? I think they are not matched with the results reported in the Table. \n\n4. Presentation of this work also needs to be refined.  \nFor instance,  \n- Stream is proposed as a benchmark but is also stated as \"we propose Stream as a method\", which is ambiguous.   \n- \"We perform a systematic analysis of meta-training statistics from the literature that are used to identify novel tasks, to find that they correlate to the learning-gap.\" The meta-training statistics are known for identifying novel tasks in the past literature. Why (the analysis is) to find that they correlate to the learning-gap\"? Similar sentences can be found, such as \"We survey Meta-Statistics (Table 2) from the literature to show the novelty of our benchmark and when compared with previous benchmarks.\" Why can the survey show the novelty of the benchmark?\n- In Table 5, the methods in the last two rows are supposed to be \"f_{h} + Meta-Samp + ER\" and \"\u03b1MetaSup + Meta-Samp + ER\", right?"
