(2023) for NER.\" For fairness, it also makes sense to use your UniversalNER prompting template with ChatGPT. Otherwise we don't know what the cause is for you beating ChatGPT while distilling from it. Please add this experiment.\n- In section 5.5, about entity type paraphrasing - this issue seems inherited from your silver training data where generated types are likely not unique while referring to the same underlying type. Seems like this issue isn't really a concern because you provide the known types from each dataset, but would be a concern for true open-domain NER where the types are not known ahead of time. No changes are requested here, but I would appreciate hearing your response to this observation.\n- The section \"Recognition of diverse entity types\" does not \"effectively demonstrate our model\u2019s capacity to capture entities of various types.\" It's just a single picked example. Please consider doing a manual evaluation on 100 samples to actually demonstrate what you claim here."

Even so, the presented results in Table 2 show that the UniNER with such a large scale of parameters did not improve significantly and are not comparable with supervised small models in some dataset. Therefore, it is doubtful to use prompt-based method with LLM to solve NER problems. Moreover, the training cost are not presented explicitly. The motivation should be clarified carefully.\n- The proposed method could be very unstable as the dataset construction includes several uncontrol factors. Thus the reproduction of the results could be problematic.  I suggest the authors should claim the related limitations clearly.   \n\n[a] Liu et al.
