The LLM then translates both of these into formal statements.  Manually developed filters then eliminate some of the proposed solutions, whose steps are then checked in a theorem prover.

How much extra time this would cost?\n\n1. again, out of curiosity (rather than for the paper): is there a branch of the autoformalization project working on extending the formal libraries?  I'm wondering whether Gowers' Polymath, or Tao's recent interest in Lean could help plug gaps in formal libraries.\n\n1. relatedly, could DTV help with Hales' Formal Abstracts project, https://formalabstracts.github.io/ ?  (This seems to have been dormant.)\n\n1.

Given a problem written in an informal statement, DTV generates both an informal solution and a formal statement by using an LLM. Then, DTV uses an automated theorem prover to verify the answer. Finally, DTV decides its output by performing majority voting among verified answers. Experimental results show that the proposed method\ncan improve the performance of an LLM in multiple reasoning benchmarks."

It is an unfair comparison since the performance improvement comes\nfrom the power of GPT-3.5, and we should compare the results of baseline methods using GPT-3.5. Without GPT-3.5, the improvement by DTV seems marginal.\n2. The paper claims that DTV improves the performance of LLMs and sets simple baseline methods using just LLMs. To prove the claim true, the paper should show experimental results\nwhen we combine DTV with multiple LLMs, as is reported in (Wang et al., 2022).\n\n**Concerns about the number of samples and the efficiency of the DTV:**\nCompared with majority voting, the proposed method needs at least three times more queries to an LLM to obtain a sample solution (informal solution generation, formal statement generation, and formal sketch generation, and I think the self-critique filter needs more queries per sample). As reported in (Wang et al., 2022), the performance of majority voting improves as we generate more samples. Therefore, the paper should report how the performance of DTV and majority voting changes when we change the number of samples n, and should \ndiscuss whether such additional cost of DTV pays off. That is, if we need $m$ queries to obtain a sample solution of DTV, then I think the performance of the proposed method\nshould be compared with the majority voting of $nm$ samples."

Additionally, we obtain a rigorous mathematical proof with all gaps closed.\n\nAlthough the big framework of this work is similar to what has been proposed in previous works such as Draft, Sketch, and Prove: Guiding formal theorem provers with informal proofs, the experiments conducted here is much more comprehensive, and a few extra mechanisms to help with the performance have also been introduced, such as the filters for faithful translations."
