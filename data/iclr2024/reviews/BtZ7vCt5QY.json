                "value": "1.\tI guess, in my mind, it does very little good to say a method can deal with high dimensions without saying how high. There are two examples, one for 43 variables and another for 100 (genome reduced to this). Some may not consider this to be high-dimensional, so it would be better to say up front what dimension one hopes to achieve with the method (after variable reduction is done).\n2.\tAlso, it\u2019s important to say what density such models can attain. It\u2019s possible with some very high-dimensional data that the models may, in fact, be very dense, a situation that can be addressed currently in the linear Gaussian or non-Gaussian case. However, this hasn\u2019t been addressed to my knowledge for models with more general connection functions, a possible advantage of the method in this paper. \n3.\tThere are recent papers that address a dense searches for the linear, Gaussian case and linear, non-Gaussian cases. The secret of some of these papers is to relax the Faithfulness condition, something which does allow some nonlinear functions to be addressed in a linear framework. The secret of others (like DirectLiNGAM) is to move to the linear, non-Gaussian regime. It would be really wonderful if an approach like the one in this paper could be shown to improve these algorithms (which look to be state-of-the-art) for some choices of nonlinear functions.\n4.\tAlong these lines, I think it\u2019s important when saying you\u2019re outperforming methods to include in this the relaxation of assumptions that you\u2019ve done and to compare only to other methods that relax assumptions in similar ways or that use stronger assumptions, explicitly noting this and show that with the stronger assumptions worse results are achieved. (The latter is not always the case.)\n5.\tThe restriction to binary data for some of the theory is somewhat severe since very few real datasets consist entirely of binary variables, though perhaps I misunderstand.\n6.\tI\u2019m not sure how \u201cMNR\u201d abbreviates \u201cMissing At Random\u201d; I think it must be \u201cMAR.\u201d\n\n\nNOTE: I read the response; I thought it was convincing, so I'm raising my rating.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Even though I selected ``good'' in Presentation, I believe the exposition can nonetheless be significantly improved. For example, some of the key assumptions and elements are delayed to Appendix so the flow seems a bit broken, in particular in the first several sections. I strongly recommend that the authors consider revising their manuscript to make the flow smoother.\n\n2. In the simulation, this paper considered scenarios with p=100/200 and n=10000, which do not seem to be a very high-dimensional regime. What would be the performance if we further increase the covariate dimension p or decrease the sample size n?\n\n3. Missing references: doubly-robustness should be traced back to Robins et al. 1994 JASA. Also, Farrell et al. was cited twice in the paper (one arxiv version, one joe published version). A recent paper led by Xiaohong Chen and colleagues (Chen, Liu, Ma, Zhang, to appear in JoE) also addresses a similar problem, though their nuisance models are slightly different (Barron space). This paper should also be cited.\n\n4. Theory-practice gap: As we know, almost all theoretical works on deep learning do not reflect practice. For instance, sparse neural nets are generally difficult to fit, as persuasively argued in Farrell, Liang, and Misra ECTA 2021. The authors are recommended to comment on this, for readers to better understand what are the key elements that allow Causal-Stonet to learn the sparse neural nets.\n\n5. In causal inference, often times $x$ has clear scientific meaning. For sparse models, I would imagine that the input layer sparsity seems to be more important. If putting sparsity in output layer, this is essentially saying that there is some sparse nonlinear representation of the input. By assuming sparse neural nets, however, this is saying that the nonlinear representation itself is also in some sense sparse. Is it really aligned with our view of the real world or is it more like a contrived modeling assumption? I hope that the authors could further comment on the modeling philosophy adopted in this paper."

                "value": "1. Do the theoretical results rely on equation (6)? If so, then the theoretical results seem to go against the conventional wisdom in the deep learning literature, that is, the neural parameters themselves are not scientifically meaningful so it is not that important to learn the neural net parameters.\n\n2. In theory, the propensity model and outcome model are both sparse models with sparsity levels lower than n^{3/16}. In linear models, the sparsity allowed is n^{1 / 2} up to log factors. Could the authors provide a heuristic explanation on the rate n^{3 / 16}?"
