The motivation is to introduce small number of (new) parameters as much as possible during adpatation of a pre-trained model. The paper proposes parameter-efficient adpatation of multimodal networks.  Three different parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, including low-rank adpatation, scaling and shifting of features, and BitFit, have been investigated towards learning a model robust to missing modalities. Given a pre-trained network, in order to adapt this model to a subset of modalities, small set of parameters (as a layer) are introduced after each layer of the network. During adaptation to this subset of modality combination, only these small set of parameters are trained. Experiments have been performed with two different base networks for the task of multimodal semantic segmentation and multimodal sentiment analyses. Results claim to achieve better performance than competing robust methods and often surpass dedicated models."
