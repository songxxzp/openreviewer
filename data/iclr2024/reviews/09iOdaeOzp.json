The dynamic batching technique works by first estimating reference losses for different data domains via computing scaling curves and then adjusting weighting terms for different domains based on the difference between the reference loss and validation loss at different validation intervals. The dynamic batch loading method sounds a bit heuristic, and it requires computing scaling curves which can be often expensive (otherwise the algorithm cannot work), which may need a lot of computing and training time to obtain reference losses if there are many domains. Therefore, the efficacy of this method is questionable."

                "value": "The proposed pruning method is sound, but it is very specific for the Transformer architecture.\n\nThe title \"ACCELERATING LANGUAGE MODEL PRE-TRAINING VIA STRUCTURED PRUNING\" is somewhat misleading, as it suggests that the paper is proposing a generic pre-training method. My understanding is that these methods only work in a limited setting. First, a competitive pre-trained checkpoint is required. The proposed methods cannot be used when a model needs to be pre-trained from scratch. However, they may be effective in certain cases, such as when an LLM needs to be compressed and trained on different data domains (not necessarily the same ones used in the original pre-training).\n\nAdditionally, the authors' claim that this method can significantly reduce training costs compared to other LLMs trained from scratch is an overstatement, e.g. saying things like the proposed variant is outperforming baselines (which are usually trained on 300B~1T tokens) by only trained on 50B tokens. The authors should count the cost of training the source LLM as the worst-case scenario. Comparing the performance with other baselines without counting the significant training computes used for the source LLMs (7B parameters and 2T tokens) is unfair. To my knowledge, the dynamic batch loading technique is required to recover the performance on the data domains after pruning. In that case, the cost to compute the reference losses should also be reported somewhere in the paper, and it should be mentioned in the main table. It is misleading to only count the tokens used for a single training run of the pruned model when there are significant prerequisites to make it work in the first place (pre-trained and competitive LLMs and performing scaling studies on different sub-datasets).\n\nIf the same methods can also be applied to another source LLM and show similar improvements over baselines, this would reinforce the reported findings. It is difficult to distinguish whether the improvement is due to the superiority of the source LLM or the proposed methods.\n\nMinor comments:\nIn Section 2.2, you wrote \" pre-training dataset RedPajama (TogetherAI, 2023b; LLaMA\u2019s pre-training dataset)\". RedPajama is not the exact pre-training dataset used to train LLAMA2, but it's an open-source version trying to replicate the original training corpus, am I correct?\n\nIf Figure 8 is mentioned in the main paper, it should be included in the main paper, not the appendix."

And it's unclear which part plays the most important role in pruning & fine-tuning.\n\n* Sheared LLaMA employs regularized training as a preliminary step before pruning. However, **the effectiveness of the proposed constrained optimization remains unclear**. As illustrated in Table 10, the performance gap between Sheared LLaMA and LLM-Pruner (a simple Taylor-based method) is marginal (\u0394PPL=0.24). Questions arise regarding whether this improvement is attributable to the proposed pruning method or the dynamic batch loading. Additionally, it's unclear if the LLM-Pruner baseline was also trained with dynamic batch loading. \n* Based on the previous questions, this work mentioned that \"This observation indicates that pruning preserves a greater amount of knowledge in low-entropy and smaller domains (e.g., GitHub) compared to high-entropy and larger domains (e.g., C4)\". However, this phenomenon might be also caused by a biased regularization before pruning, since the regularized training step only saw 0.4B tokens as mentioned in Sec. (4.3). Maybe this problem can be avoided by sampling balanced data from different domains for regularization, or deploying a simple Taylor expansion [1, 2] with balanced data. \n* Table 4 presents some confusing results: CoFiPruning [1] shows superior Perplexity (PPL) but inferior Throughput compared to Sheared LLaMA. This raises the question: are CoFiPruning and Sheared LLaMA comparable in performance? Given these mixed results, it's difficult to conclusively state that Sheared LLaMA has outperformed CoFiPruning. \n* Might be a typo: There's an inconsistency in reporting the size of the LLM-Pruner baseline -- labeled as 1.3B in the figure caption but noted as 1.6B in the table. Clarifying these comparisons would be helpful.\n\n\n[1] Xia, M., Zhong, Z., & Chen, D. (2022).

By pruning pretrained models to a target architecture with targeted structured pruning and using a short retraining period (\"continued training\"), the submission's proposed approach is able to address the prior problems in this significant area. The resulting models are trained faster and perform better than models trained from scratch, and they perform inference faster than models pruned by other approaches.\n\nThe shearing algorithm (\"targeted structured pruning\") is very clearly explained (with nice illustrations) and is simple despite its flexibility and power. The idea of pruning towards a target architecture is (as far as I know) novel.\n\nTo enhance learning in the pruned model during \"continued training\", an original scheme to dynamically change the data mixture is developed (\"Dynamic Batch Loading\"). This scheme is not only interesting for its usefulness to Sheared-LLaMA -- as the authors suggest, it could be used to help make any model's training more efficient by avoiding usage of training data that makes relatively little progress towards the desired model performances.\n\nThe analyses (e.g., of Dynamic Batch Loading, of other pruning approaches, etc.) thoroughly support the manuscript's arguments."

To better understand the effect of the discovered pruning mask on performance during the \"continued training\" period, perhaps you could use only C4 data to find the pruning mask. If you did this, would \"continued training\" on the mixture of domains (without dynamic batch loading) still show GitHub performance reaching its reference loss and C4 performance not reaching its reference loss? Some related questions follow.\n   - Are losses being reduced at different rates across domains because the pruning mask was learned on too little data to account for the complexity of some domains (like C4)?\n   - 2 million tokens (500 sequences) are used for each held-out set: should the held-out set size be larger for more complex datasets (e.g., C4) to ensure that the pruning mask is found on a representative set of data?\n\n2. A version of Figure 4 with perplexity or loss. \n\nMinor:\n\n1. There are numerous typos. Please proofread the paper carefully. Some examples follow:\n   - \"Sheared-LLaMA-3B\" is mentioned but 2.7B is probably intended.\n   - $z^{inter}$ and $z^{int}$ are used interchangeably, so are $H^T$ and $H_T$.\n   - Table 2 seems to have NQ and LAMBADA switched in the 7B row. \n   - Section 4.1: \"hypothetical 2.7B parameter LLaMA2 model\" is stated. Do you mean 1.3B?\n   - Figure 8's caption is wrong.\n\n2. How are the Lagrange multipliers initialized? Relatedly, a reference for the specific Lagrange multiplier approach used might be nice to include -- Platt and Barr (1987) looks related but not exactly the same. \n\n3. In section 4.2, the sentence \"non-uniformity also introduces training and inference overhead due to irregularities in model architectures\" could be followed by intuition/clarification that explains why irregularities add overhead. \n\n4.

Given that the proposed targeted structured pruning falls within the realm of structural pruning, a comparative analysis with LLM-Pruner[7] is essential to establish whether the newly proposed method improves upon the existing techniques for structured pruning of large language models. Utilizing the same experimental settings as LLM-Pruner for this comparison would provide a more direct and clear demonstration of the proposed method's effectiveness.\n\n3. I cannot tell whether the enhanced performance is attributed to a stronger foundational model (LLaMA2) from which pruning occurs. It's conceivable that starting with a stronger base model could lead to better results post-pruning. Have any experiments been conducted where a model, for instance, OPT-2.7B, is pruned down to 1.3B and then compared against the officially pre-trained OPT-1.3B? (Given the limited time available for rebuttal, it might not be feasible to pre-train a 1.3B model. Conducting a similar experiment with a considerably smaller model, such as a 350M version, could also provide valuable insights.)\n\n[1] Learning Sparse Neural Networks Though L0 Regularization. 2017.  \n[2] Learning Structured Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks. 2016.  \n[3] Neural Pruning via Growing Regularization. 2020.  \n[4] Fast Post-Training Pruning Framework for Transformers. 2022.  \n[5] Dynamic Sparse Training: Find Efficient Sparse Network From Scratch With Trainable Masked Layers. 2020.  \n[6] DoReMi: Optimizing Data Mixtures Speeds Up Language Model Pretraining. 2023.   \n[7] LLM-Pruner: On the Structural Pruning of Large Language Models. 2023."
