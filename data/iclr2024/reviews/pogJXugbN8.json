                "value": "This work proposes BAFFLE, a method for zero-order optimization in the federated setting. The main motivation behind zero-order optimization is its memory efficiency, as no activations need to be stored for a backward pass, it is compatible with hardware designed for inference only and, furthermore, its memory efficiency allows for training within a trusted execution environment (TEE). The recipe is quite simple, in that the server communicates a random seed and a model to the clients and then each of the clients does $2K$ forward passes with weights $w \\pm \\delta_k$ and their local data.  The loss differences are then communicated and aggregated at the server where, together with the perturbations $\\delta_k$, an approximation to the model gradient can be computed. The authors provide guidelines that allow such a scheme to be successful and then show, for moderately large values of $K$, that BAFFLE can reach performance comparable to vanilla backpropagation."

This memory efficiency also allows for training within a TEE. \n- The zero-order nature might allow BAFFLE to be compatible with inference only models and accelerators.  \n- The authors also propose useful guidelines for BAFFLE, which I believe can be useful for zero-order optimization in general. \n- The authors provide a theoretical convergence analysis of BAFFLE. \n- Experiments cover a decent variety of settings, from different settings of data non-i.i.d.-ness to computation / memory efficiency and robustness"

                "value": "I believe this work has relatively limited novelty, especially given prior work. More specifically, the authors discuss both forward finite differences and central finite differences but in the experiments they mention using forward finite differences, due to it being better for the specific amount of sample budget they consider. As far as I see, forward finite differences is essentially the exact same thing as Evolution Strategies (e.g., see [1]) which has already been considered for training neural network type of models in parallel (again, see [1]). \n\nFurthermore, some of the claims of the method could use more details. For example, the authors mention that BAFFLE can apply to models optimised for inference, e.g., models that have been quantised and pruned. However, adding Gaussian noise to the weights can break both the quantization and (unstructured) pruning, so it is unclear whether these models would be able to run on their dedicated accelerators (which sometimes require weights to, e.g., be properly qunatized in a uniform grid). The authors also argue that secure aggregation (SAG) is compatible with BAFFLE, however, as far as I know, SAG requires the inputs to be quantised and this is not discussed in the main text. \n\nFinally, if memory constraint is an issue, I believe an important baseline is missing and that is gradient checkpointing for BP, which can also reduce memory costs at the expense of more compute (which is the tradeoff BAFFLE also has).  \n\n[1] Evolution Strategies as a Scalable Alternative to Reinforcement Learning, Salimans et al., 2017"

How does it affect the convergence behaviour? \n- The convergence based on a finite number of forward passes depends on a constant $C_0$. How large is that constant in practice? \n- The harms of batch normalisation and its replacement by group normalisation, that the authors argue for as a guideline, is not new and has been discussed in various other works in federated learning, e.g, [2]. I would suggest that the authors properly attribute these prior works.\n- Are the experiments shown with full client participation? Partial client participation is more common in cross-device settings (which is usually the case where resource constraints appear), so it would be interesting to see results with that, especially given that it increases gradient variance. \n- I would suggest to the authors to elaborate on any differences with respect to [1].\n- I would suggest to the authors to elaborate about the feasibility of evaluating quantized / pruned models with Gaussian noise on their weights on dedicated hardware accelerators.\n\n[2] The non-IID data quagmire of decentralized machine learning, Hsieh et al., 2019"

In experiments, the authors show that BAFFLE is more resource efficient than full backpropagation, while achieving a lower accuracy, which is natural. Now the question is, in which environments should we use BAFFLE, and when is full backpropagation better? There is no clear guidance on this. One thing the authors can investigate is the accuracy vs. resource (e.g., client-side computation or overall delay, etc) plot. Depending on the system parameters, it would be meaningful if the authors can provide when BAFFLE should be utilized instead of full backprop.\n\n3.

Ideally, as presented in the paper \u201cBAFFLE results in approximately K/5 times the computation expense of BP-based FL\u201d, but it would be convincing if there is experimental evidence. Additionally, what is the number of local steps for your BP baseline (FedAvg or FedSGD)? It is crucial to point this number of local steps out. A simple example: Suppose \u201cBAFFLE results in approximately K/5 times the computation expense of BP-based FL\u201d holds correctly. If conducting K=5000 steps of BAFFLE for 20 epochs can achieve comparable accuracy as conducting 100 steps of FedAvg for 20 epochs.
