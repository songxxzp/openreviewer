                "value": "This paper introduces a two-stage fine-tuning process aimed at enhancing a pre-trained language model's performance. In the first stage, the focus is on improving the LM's ability to effectively utilize retrieved information, while in the second stage, the retriever is fine-tuned to provide more contextually relevant results as desired by the LM. The study reveals that both of these stages contribute significantly to performance enhancements. Furthermore, when both stages are combined, even greater improvements are observed. The proposed model, RA-DIT 65B, achieves state-of-the-art results in various knowledge-intensive zero-/few-shot learning tasks, surpassing existing in-context RALM approaches by a substantial margin."

If included, it is suggested that FID+RS would outperform the proposed model, based on reported scores from the FID+RS paper. Additionally, FID+RS has the advantage of a significantly smaller model size, which raises questions about the efficiency and resource requirements of the proposed model. (11B vs 65B)"

By training the LLM to make correct predictions when a wrong retrieved chunk is given, we enable the LLM to ignore misleading retrieval content and lean into its parametric knowledge in such cases\u201d\n- This process may encourage the LLM to hallucinate if i) answer is not in retrieved context, and ii) the required knowledge for answering the question is not stored in LLM parameters. \n\n3. For baseline Llama 65B, did you apply instruction tuning using the same blended dataset? In Table 4, the improvement from IT 65B vs.RA-IT 65B is pretty marginal with the top-1 chunk. \n\n4. Could the authors also provide the results using top-5 in Table 4?\n\n5. In Table 2 main results, why is Llama 65B so bad on NQ?
