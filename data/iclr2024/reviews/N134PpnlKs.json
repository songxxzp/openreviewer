To achieve this they modify continuous normalizing flows to augment them with history of latent variables that bridge the gap of partial observability and causal insufficiency (presence of hidden confounders). As a result, the model can allow counterfactual queries. Additionally, they introduce a proof that shows that training with observational and interventional data can improve performance as compared to training only on interventional data."

This should be stated in the first paragraph and not scattered around two pages of introduction (leaving a feeling of lack of focus). For example paragraph three is motivating a setting but doesn\u2019t explicitly express it and then paragraph four start talking about something different (stiff ODE) without ever defining it or commenting on the relevance of stiff ODEs with this setting. After reading the paper several times, still cannot understand why this specific setting suffers from stiff ODEs.\n- The paper combines too many ideas and it doesn\u2019t spend much time to explain and study each of the ideas properly. For example, the penalty for mitigating stiffness is not ablated sufficiently (stiff ODEs are not even defined on the paper which makes it very hard to read)\n- Related work and background section is out of focus and missing key parts as well. For example, why is causal discovery discussed? How is causal inference relevant? Is it a causality paper, if so where is the background section introducing key concepts?\n- The paper is appendix heavy. A lot of the content should have been surfaced in the main text. For example, assumptions C.{1,2,3} are essential and should be surfaced on the main. Significance of theoretical results should be discussed in main as well."

Please write a sentence explaining it as simple as possible. This shouldn't be guessed by the reader.\n- in paragraph 3, \"which can be counterproductive\" - it's not counterproductive only, it casts the problem non-identifiable.

If so, would discussion of offline RL be of relevance here?\n- In POMDP formulation you say that rewards are not required, however if you remove rewards from the POMDP then it's just a graphical model (Decision Process requires rewards). What does the POMDP formulation buy you?\n- What is the \"twinned space\"?\n- In 3.2 you stalk about the stability of Monte Carlo estimate. Where are you using MC?\n- You cite Manski 1989, can you please comment on the relevance of this paper to you work? It doesn't seem to comment on the use of \"observational data helping learning the dynamics of discrete interventional settings\".\n- Figure 6 - The plot doesn't match the performance of the baselines in the paper. Did you use the same code? Also, how many seeds did you run? Are you plotting the standard error? I don't see any variance on your method - is this because it's stable between seeds?\n- What is the take-away message from the half cheetah example? How is this experiment related to your setting?"

The model promises to perform predictions in the presence of unobserved confounding, to detect anomalies, to do counterfactual inference, and to facilitate reinforcement learning and treatment effect prediction. To verify the claimed properties of the model, the authors provided experiments with different benchmarks."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The main weakness of the paper, in my opinion, is that TIF aim at many different applications, but the lack of rigour and experimental evidence makes it unclear what this method is actually useful for. \n\n**Lack of rigour**. The paper positions itself as both a reinforcement learning and a (causal) time-varying treatment effect estimation method but makes little effort to explain the connections between both. It inherits the assumptions, typical for reinforcement learning, i.e., POMDP, but uses it for causal benchmarks, like interventional or counterfactual predictions. For example, benchmarks for interventional predictions (like the tumor generator) are based on a different set of assumptions, e.g., three assumptions from Seedat et al. (2022), and, thus, are not suitable for TIF. Importantly, the straight application of the method to interventional and counterfactual prediction tasks raises many identifiability questions. For example, is there a need to adjust for time-varying observed confounders or to perform propensity weighting to obtain unbiased interventional predictions? Also, what is the purpose of the data with the hidden confounding (I understand, that it does not harm performance, given infinite data, but I don\u2019t see how it could facilitate interventional predictions). Regarding counterfactual predictions, they would require even stronger identifiability assumptions [1], such as additive latent noise. Those assumptions are not properly discussed in the paper. The paper also claims to handle unobserved confounding, but in this case, without further assumptions, the causal effects are non-identifiable. \n\n**Lack of experimental evidence**. Some key statements in the paper were not supported by the experimental evidence, for example, the claim that TIF are better than methods with low-dimensional embeddings. Also, the authors claimed that the method provides accurate density estimates, but no comparison with other density estimators was provided. The same applies to the counterfactual benchmark, where no fair comparison with other existing baselines, e.g., [2], were provided, or anomaly detection benchmark. Regarding, the RL benchmark, it does not seem like TIF significantly outperformed VAE-RNN (see Fig. 6). Also, there are no implementation details provided for the benchmarks. Additionally, I found it unfair, that the authors did not provide details on the hyper-parameter tuning and did not provide the source code of the method. E.g., it is unclear, how to choose the latent dimensionality ($n - m$) or number of MC samples. For the same reason, I cannot verify, whether the comparison between TIF and TE-CDEs was fair for the interventional prediction benchmark.\n\nI also have several minor remarks, which are important for clarity and understanding of the paper:\n- Table 1 mixes up completely different methods, aka \u201ccompares apples with oranges\u201d, e.g., causal inference methods with reinforcement learning methods; time-varying methods and cross-sectional methods, etc. Also, it is unclear, what property \u201cmaking prediction in the presence of unobserved confounders\u201d means, as in this case, we would need to assume some sensitivity model and perform partial identification of causal effects. Additionally, there seem to be wrong entries, like the cross for De Brouwer et al. (2022) at \u201clogp\u201d column (this paper assumes a likelihood model, thus we can infer log-probability), or Seedat et al. (2022) at \u201cconf\u201d (TE-CDEs are not suitable for hidden confounding).\n- Some of the notation and definitions in the paper were not properly introduced. For example, a POMDP was never formally defined. Also, what is $\\hat{Q}_{t_j, t}$ in Eq. 1? What is the definition of the \u201cprivileged data\u201d? What are \u201csub-flows\u201d?\n- Some of the causal inference terminology is used inconsistently. For example, counterfactual prediction is sometimes used in the meaning of the interventional (Sec. 4.2), and \u201ccounterfactual trajectories\u201d are used instead of \u201cinterventional trajectories\u201d (Sec. 4.1 \u201cCounterfactual prediction\u201d). Notably, the terms \u201cinterventional\u201d and \u201ccounterfactual\u201d denote fundamentally different concepts of causal inference. \n- I found the usage of the terms \u201cobservational\u201d and \u201cinterventional\u201d data a bit confusing in this paper. Usually, the term \u201cobservational data\u201d is used for the data, where treatment assignment depends on other observed $o$ and unobserved \u201cl\u201d confounders, whereas \u201cinterventional data\u201d means a randomised control trial, i.e., no arrows leading to variables $a$ in Fig. 1. This paper, on the other hand, uses the term \u201cobservational\u201d for the data with unobserved confounders and \u201cinterventional\u201d for the data with all confounders observed.\n- Seems like the authors confused the causal Markov condition and Markov property of POMDP, which are two different things. \n\nreferences:\n[1] Nasr-Esfahany, Arash, Mohammad Alizadeh, and Devavrat Shah. \"Counterfactual identifiability of bijective causal models.\"\u00a0International Conference on Machine Learning.

All transformation/mapping happens in the same dimensions. This would limit generalizing the model to complex data with high dimensionality (e.g, clinical data, EHR, images).
