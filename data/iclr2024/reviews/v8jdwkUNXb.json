                "value": "It is known that the inference process of the diffusion model can be slow. In the context of RL, the diffusion model has been introduced and widely adopted recently. The authors focus on addressing the slow inference speed issue of diffusion in this paper. Their solution is to replace the diffusion model with the recently proposed consistency model. The authors make some minor adaptations of consistency models to make it fit the RL setting. The authors also test their method across offline RL setting, online RL setting, and offline2online finetuning setting, by building a consistency model on top of behavior cloning and actor-critic structure."

The authors then propose to address this issue by using an existing method, the consistency model, and adapting it to the offline RL setting. This, as far as the reviewer can tell, is the first work that introduces the consistency model into the offline RL setting, online RL setting and offline2online setting. This paper is generally quite well-written, and I enjoy reading this work. The structure of this paper is clear and easy to follow. It is easy for the readers to capture the core points/conclusions in the experiment section. The authors conduct several experiments in D4RL domains like MuJoCo, AntMaze, etc., to show that their method can reduce the training time and inference time while maintaining comparable performance. The authors also do a good job in the related work part."

                "value": "# Weaknesses\n\nDespite the aforementioned strengths of this paper, I think this paper is below the acceptance bar of this venue. Please refer to the following comments\n\n- (major) The novelty of this paper is limited. The authors simply borrow an existing method from the vision community and apply it to the RL tasks, with some minor modifications. I do not see much novelty in doing so. This paper seems more like a technical report or experimental report, in that the authors conduct several experiments and summarize the conclusions. One serious flaw of this paper is that the author merely reports some experimental phenomenons while the corresponding explanations and discussion are unfortunately missing. From an ICLR paper of this kind, I would expect to understand why such a phenomenon occurs. This paper leaves me with more questions than answers. For example, why on many offline and offline2online tasks, the consistency model underperform the diffusion model, while on some online hard tasks, the consistency model seems to be better?\n\n- (major) This paper does not consider statistical significance. Written statements and the presentation of the results as tables (often without standard deviations) obscure this flaw. In fact, ALL tables in this paper do not include any signal of statistical significance for baseline methods, e.g., std, IQM [1]. We have reached a point of maturity in the field where claims need to be made in reference to actual statistical evidence, which seems to be lacking in the current presentation.\n\n[1] Deep reinforcement learning at the edge of the statistical precipice. NeurIPS\n\n- (major) The proposed consistency-BC or consistency-AC do not show much improvement over the diffusion-based counterparts. If one looks at the experiments in this paper, it is clear that the consistency-BC and consistency-AC cannot beat diffusion-BC or diffusion-QL on most of the tasks. The authors say that consistency-AC or consistency-BC can achieve less training time. Well, I do not see this as an appealing advantage over the diffusion-based methods, since training cost is somewhat unimportant, while the most critical part, from my perspective, is the inference speed. Let us then take a look at the inference cost. Based on Table 3 in the main text, it is clear that the inference speed of diffusion-QL is quite similar to that of the consistency-AC. For instance, when setting $N=5$, the inference speed of diffusion-QL gives 3.76ms and consistency-AC gives 3.39ms, while their performance differs (diffusion-QL has an average score of 108.2, while consistency-AC only has 101.4). I actually do not see many advantages of utilizing consistency-AC or consistency-BC in practice\n\n- (major) Even worse, it seems that the performance of consistency-AC and consistency-BC are acquired by carefully tuning the hyperparameters. As a piece of evidence, one can see the hyperparameter setup in Appendix C (Table 5). This indicates that the generality and effectiveness of the proposed method are limited\n\n- (minor) On page 3, Eq 3 is the objective using clipped double Q-learning instead of vanilla double Q-learning. The authors ought to cite the TD3 paper here instead of the double Q-learning paper.\n\n- (minor) No codes are provided in this paper, and the authors do not include a reproducibility statement section in the main text"

As an example, why do you use AWR, BRAC, and REM on adroit tasks and kitchen tasks in Table 1? It seems to me that the advantages of consistency-BC and consistency-AC are illustrated by carefully picking the baselines.\n\n- how important is the gradient norm to the consistency-BC and consistency-AC algorithms?"

Is the consistency policy trained for all tasks across all suites? Or does the offline dataset have different successful behavior policies? The author should make it more clear. \n\n(2) In the specific tasks in RL, the scenarios are not abundant and the trajectories are quite similar. If more expressive policy representation can result in better performances, what if using some large pre-trained representation models, can this problem be solved? (E.g. R3M)"
