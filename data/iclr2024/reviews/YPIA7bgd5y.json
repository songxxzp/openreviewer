This hypothesis is rejected through an experiment where labels of some ICL examples are corrupted in different positions of the input sequence and the performance is shown to depend on which ICL examples were corrupted. \n\nThe paper concludes that ICL is in some ways similar to conventional learning algorithms (H1) but different in other ways (H2 and H3)."

For example, in \"Making Pre-trained Language Models Better Few-shot Learners\", Gao et al show that even fine-tuning the models with flipped or neutral labels degrades their performance, so even conventional learning is not able to overcome the pre-training priors.\nH3. Sample order does matter in conventional learning too, that is why we shuffle the training data. In addition, these experiments seem to be a re-discovery of the recency bias in LLMs, for example studied in \"Calibrate Before Use: Improving Few-Shot Performance of Language Models\", Zhao. et al\n\nLastly, one major claim of the paper is that although flipping/randomizing labels of ICL examples sometimes does not affect accuracy of the model much, but probabilistic metrics such as log likelihood or entropy reveal larger gaps in performance. But this claim is not quantified well, because accuracy has a clear and interpretable range but the same cannot be said about loglikelihood.\n\n\n\n\nMinor writing suggestions:\n- \"expresses the sentiment\" --> the word sentiment not appropriate for describing a scientific paper's conclusion\n- \"This is important when the context contains diverging information about a label relationship\" --> unclear"

However, there is disagreement on how in-context learning works, with some papers drawing analogy to SGD, others to kernel regression, Bayesian inference, etc. To understand how ICL works, this paper identifies several assumptions of expected behavior of \"conventional learning algorithms\", e.g., models that learn P(y | x) from x_train, y_train ~ P and tests if ICL follows such behaviors. There are several questions proposed for the classification setting: do model predictions depend on ICL example labels? Can ICL work on tasks that are not seen in the pre-training corpus? Can ICL ignore bias from pre-training data? And does ICL treat all in-context information equally? \n\nThrough a systematic evaluation of several models and classification tasks, the paper concludes that 1) ICL depends on the in-context labels 2) ICL can work on tasks not seen in pre-training corpus 3) the pre-training preference matters, and 4) not all information is regarded equally. This refutes the findings of a previous paper (Min et. al.) and has implications for alignment and robustness of LLMs. More generally, it imposes some conditions on the loose analogy of ICL as a conventional learning algorithm."

However, I think the study overall is quite novel and rigorous. \n\nQuality:\n- For section 5, it would be nice to show how the model performance degrades as randomization increases. Similarly in section 7, you could try gradually mixing in the flipped labels or the arbitrary labels. I think this could help us study the robustness of ICL (in contrast to deep learning models or conventional learning algorithms), as in-context information can often be noisy in general. For instance, I am thinking of an example where the human prompter is giving examples of their preferences to align a model, and fails to accurately articulate one or two examples. \n- Another experiment I'd be interested in seeing: can you study the Lipschitzness/label consistency of ICL? For example, you can come up with a setting like \"x1 y1 x2 y2 .... xtest ?\" where xtest is a perturbation of one of the x_i's (e.g. a slight rewording, or very close by in embedding space). Will the model predict ytest to be equal to y_i? And will this happen even if we scramble the labels? How different from x_i does x_test need to be in order for it to no longer be significantly influenced by a flipped y_i? Overall I think extending your study to consider the relationships among the x_i's and the x_test w.r.t. the label is interesting, since this is a property of conventional learning algorithms (inputs with similar feature vectors have similar labels). \n\nClarity:\n- Minor nit: I'd prefer some more signposting about how a conventional learning algorithm is defined, or some notation of (x_ICL, y_ICL) versus conventional (x_train, y_train). Is a deep learning model considered a conventional learner if it can fit to arbitrary noise? \n- In section 5 I'd appreciate an example of what randomizing the labels exactly means. I had it confused with the experiment in section 7, whose arbitrary (A, B) experiment could be thought of as randomizing the label space but not the label relationships. \n- While I found the experiment in section 6 to be quite clever, I feel like \"novel task we create\" can be made a bit more explicit by specifying it's based on your private data. Without any elaboration, I was surprised about how you were so certain about the task."

On the other hand, I do buy the argument that for small models and hard tasks, changing the in-context examples significantly will still result in the model doing poorly, thus appearing to not be as impacted by the random labels. Do you have any thoughts on how to interpret this? \n\n- See \"Quality\" section of Weaknesses. Would be curious to see what these behaviors are."

Thus, one can already reach the conclusion that ICL needs to use the label information **to some extent**. However, people do not know how ICL utilizes this label information. The experiment results in this paper are not enough to tell people how ICL utilizes this label information. It only shows that under another metric (the probability), using true labels and random labels is very different. It seems more like an ablation study of Min et al. Another claim for the position importance of different ICL examples, the author claims that ICL does not treat each in-context example equally. From my side, it seems to be a well-known thing, since people change the order of the ICL examples and can observe huge differences in the prediction accuracy [1]. However, people don\u2019t know how ICL treats these examples. I don\u2019t think the experiment in this section deepens our understanding of how/why ICL treats different in-context examples differently.
