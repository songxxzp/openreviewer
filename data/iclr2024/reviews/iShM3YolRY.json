More specifically, authors argue three challenges for improving open-source LLMs, including usage examples, in-context demonstration, and generation style regulation. To address these, this paper attempts to augment the practical amount of supervision and enhance LLMs by using model alignment, in-context demonstration retriever and system prompt. Moreover, this paper introduces a ToolBench benchmark to address this problem.

Based on these failure types, the author investigated the benefit of three techniques: 1) instruction-tuning LLM with samples about API calling, 2) retrieve demonstrations for in-context learning, and 3) adding a system prompt tailored to guide the model's outputs. To evaluate these techniques, the author proposed a new benchmark suite called ToolBench that covers eight different API usage scenarios. According to the experiments, the author found that the fine-tuning step boosts the tool-use capability of open-source LLM significantly, while system prompt and in-context learning robustify the LLMs for further improvement."
