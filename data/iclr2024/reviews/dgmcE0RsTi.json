After each layer, it does an elementary form of inter-chunk interaction by updating each bos and eos special tokens (indicating chunk boundaries within each chunk) with the average of newly produced eos and bos tokens (after the earlier local chunk processing layer) respectively. \n\nThe method uses reinforcement learning for token selection for decoding with rewards created to penalize selecting too many tokens and other rewards based on language modeling probabilities. PPO is used in an actor-critic framework."

More research can be done in contextualizing the work in the literature review by exploring other related works to [1,2] in the citation network.

I did not find such discussions in main context and appendix about the latency part. The author should discuss and measure it to show the tradeoff between performance gain and latency increase.\n\n2. As the selector FFN is randomly initialized but the backbone is pre-trained well, I think in the first 10k training iterations, the training might be unstable if following the alternative updates on a well-trained model and a newly-initialized model. The author provides limited details about this.\n\n3. The ablation study on the chunk length might be interesting and important. A smaller chunk length brings better granularity and a larger chunk length accelerates the inference. Is the selected 512 length the best length for chunks?"

                "value": "1. For footnote 1 of Page 3, how you deal with cases that a sentence is longer than a chunk as sometimes the sentence segmentation tool does not work well to split the sentence to desired length?\n\n2. The selector is a small-size 8M FFN. Did you consider to scale up the parameters and also change the FFN to a RoBERTa model with binary classification head? This might be better for the action decision. \n\n3. If I understands the paper well, the selector is not pre-trained and is only randomly initialized FFN. Then you fine-tune the BART and selector together on specific task. Did you try to freeze BART and pre-trained the FFN selector on the same pre-training corpus of BART? Personally, I think if your selector FFN is only 8M parameters, the pre-training might not be helpful. But if the selector size is scaled up, this might be good to the model.\n\n4. Some missing related works: TRIME (Zhong et. al., 2023) and LongMem (Wang et. al., 2023) are related to this method in terms of chunking and memorizing; Landmark Attention (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023) is related to this method in terms of S and E tokens."
