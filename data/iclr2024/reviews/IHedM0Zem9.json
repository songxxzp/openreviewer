BEEF mainly adopt an energy-efficient SNN to trigger the slicing time. Technically, a new dataset is first split into event slices by SNN, which is robust to high-speed or low-speed scenarios. Then, event slices are used to finetune the ANN to verify the performance in downstream event-based vision tasks. The experiments show that the proposed BEEF achieves SOTA performance in event-based object tracking and event-based object recognition."

Although the authors give the analysis of processing speed, it should be given the computational analysis in CPU.\n\nii) The authors have conducted a comparison experiment with a fixed number of times, as shown in Table 3. Nevertheless, it is advisable for the authors to include experiments with a fixed time window. Furthermore, the authors should investigate how various parameters for fixed events or fixed time windows compare to BEEF.

However I have a fundamental objection with this type of an approach (which is shared by quite a few of my colleagues around the world, in private conversations at least) as to why should these fundamentally asynchronous\nevent streams representations should be converted to a rather synchronous representation, simply to be able to map them into algorithms that were originally developed for synchronous frame like data. I think a more thorough discussion on this is needed in the paper to better motivate the work\n\nW2: clarify better what are the alternative methods to which this is being compared? What exactly is meant by \"fixed slice\" approaches to which this is being compared? Many approaches for producing frame like representations (such as getting the max or union of all events in a time window) result in the introduction of significant amounts of noise. In contrast morphological operands like erosion and dilation can introduce much better quality frames. To what extent is the good performance of the algorithm attributable simply to noisy frame generation in competing approaches?\n\nW3: unless i missed it, will source code be provided?"

As suggested in [1][2], there are several existing event representation strategies including stacking based on time/event counts, voxel grid, histogram of time surfaces, event spike tensor, and a recent work introduces neural representation [3]. However, this paper only mentions two of them. In addition, the motivation to consider temporal information is similar with event counts integration, which is mentioned by the authors. \n- The necessity of a very lightweight SNN is not clear. Since SNN works with ANN cooperatively, SNN has only very limited contribution to the overall computational cost. As implied in Table 2, considering the ANN is the major cost for the process, the contribution and necessity for low energy and fast speed of SNN is reduced.\n- The compared methods in the experiment are not sufficient. More event representation/stacking methods should be considered to compare with the proposed methods, including the methods mentioned in [1-3].\n- I wonder whether such iterative optimization of SNN and ANN work better than joint optimization, like we regard the whole process as an end-to-end task and optimize the SNN loss and downstream task loss together.\n- More details about the experimental settings are required. The proposed methods use adaptive slicing time, how to create GT accordingly?

We need a toy experiment to study this hypothesis with a smaller network and different slicing techniques.\n\n2. The exposition is really hard to follow. As stated directly after eq. 4, the slicing is done by grouping together events whose timestamps are between two output spikes of the SNN. Here, an experiment is needed on the statistics of this slicing and why such an approach makes sense.\n\n3. 4.3.1 has to be elaborated. While the math derivations are sound, it is not clear to the reader why the starting point of the derivations is the desire for $S_{out}$ to spike at $n^{*}$. I tried to understand it also through the observations in 4.3.2 but could not.\n\n4. The beginner's arena was meant to explain the above but is incomprehensible. What does it mean ``to slice at a specified time step $T^{*}'' ?\n\n5. It is not clear what purpose the energy computations of the SNN serve when the task will be solved with ultra consuming GPUs. \n\n6. The experimental comparison should be with approaches that are asynchronous end to end like HOTS or HATS or Cannici'19, Perot'20 etc. or approaches like the Event Transformer.\n\n7. Table 3: It is not discussed why the transformer tracker performs almost the same or better without BEEF. Why does BEEF not add anything significant when an attention mechanism is used?\n\n8. The feedback strategy is learnt during training. I understand that in this sense it is adaptive to the task rather than during inference to the event stream when the hyperparameters will be fixed.\n\n9. It is unclear whether events are treated differently according to their polarity.\n\n10. There is some problem with the definition of ${\\cal D}$ because $n_q$ is not defined anywhere but mentioned ``where $n_q$ denotes the time of the last spike''.\n\n11. It would be worth listing the latency from event to GPU output for the particular architectures on tracking and recognition. This is much more critical here than the power consumption of the CNN.\n\nSummary: The authors need to explain the slicing method more clearly (possible misreadings are listed above). My main concern is the lack of any experimental analysis or motivation for the particular quite elaborate slicing method. There is no motivation to use an SNN since the slicing is only a minimal energy and latency fraction of a pipeline that uses transformers or regression.\nThere is no comparison with architectures that use other event representations like time surfaces."

                "value": "The paper studies to learn event splits by using SNN. The triggered spikes from SNN are treated as signals for splitting event streams and constructing event frames. The proposed architecture is evaluated with object recognition and single object tracking datasets."

                "value": "* The motivation of the paper is well demonstrated. Fixed event stream fixed slicing methods potentially fail to generalize in different motion scenarios.\n* How the paper finds optimal spike time, $n_{s}$, is interesting.\n* The paper shows relative improvements over different baseline methods when using their proposed BEEF framework."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* The paper claims a fixed event split method fails to generalize. However,  event cell $C[N]$ is a discrete 2D representation generated from a fixed event split, and is used as the input for SNN. \n* BEEF can be used in ANN-based 3D CNN/Transformer seamlessly. Event cameras and SNN are all bio-inspired but do not necessarily imply that SNN is a good fit to event data."
