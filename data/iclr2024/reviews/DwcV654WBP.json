The authors state that SOTA results were achieved on zero-shot action recognition and text-to-video retrieval: TVTSv2 surpasses recent methods like CLIP-ViP, ImageBind, and InternVideo on several metrics. Ablations showed partially frozen text training avoids degradation and enables knowledge transfer. Masking was shown to improve efficiency for large models without sacrificing too much performance. Fine-tuning performance was also competitive, suggesting the approach does not hurt downstream training."

It avoids catastrophic forgetting of language knowledge via partially frozen training\nIn conclusion, the paper strongly suggests potential for pre-trained models to support out-of-the-box video applications.\nThe claims seem reasonably well supported by the results, as the proposed TVTSv2 models clearly surpass prior state-of-the-art in zero-shot action recognition and retrieval across multiple datasets. The ablation studies also provide evidence for the benefits of the partial freezing strategy and incorporation of masking techniques."

Is it the same as in CLIP?\nFine-tuning performance was not extensively benchmarked on more diverse downstream tasks, so the claims about out-of-the-box task-agnostic approach could be substantiated better.\nThe largest model studied is still limited compared to huge image models, so scalability past 1 billion parameters is unvalidated.\nPotential societal impacts of large foundation models were not addressed."

Specifically, this paper first points out the so called degradation issue existing in video representation field. Based on this degradation observation, this paper proposes a hypothesis that such degradation is from the noisy text data. Accordingly, it freezes the shallow layers of text encoder while training the deeper layers to alleviate this issue. In this way, the zero-shot performance is significantly improved to show the great generalization ability of the proposed training strategy. Very comprehensive experiments empirically validate the model effectiveness."
