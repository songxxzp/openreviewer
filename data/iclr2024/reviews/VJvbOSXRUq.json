The fidelity in section 4 (under figure 2) is not clear, \"some works have used the term fidelity instead of sufficiency\" has no citations. The authors do not clearly give the definition of necessity and reproducibility and only give the intuition of these metrics (e.g. measures if ). This makes it difficult to figure out the metrics.\nThe measurement of feasibility which is defined as the number of connected graphs is somehow one-sided. Are there other measurements that can characterize the topological properties? And the relationship between defining the similarity with the topological properties of the test dataset and the feasibility measurement should be discussed and justified."
