MOFDiff employs a coarse-grained (CG) representation derived from MOF building blocks. A graph neural network (GNN) encoder trained via contrastive learning is used to map these building blocks into a latent space (z). MOFDiff consists of four main components: \n1. A periodic contrastive GNN encoder for latent embedding\n2. A MLP for lattice parameter (L) and building block (K) count prediction\n3. A periodic GNN denoiser for diffusion-based MOF generation\n4. Finally another MLP for MOF property prediction e.g., CO2 capacity. \n\nThe denoising diffusion process consists of two steps, first on the CG based building block types and then on their 3D coordinates. Then the all atom structure is recovered using an assembly algorithm, followed by simple force field (UFF) based relaxation. MOFDiff is trained on a dataset of ~304k MOFs and shows capability in generating valid and diverse MOFs. Overall, this paper leverages a diffusion model over a CG representation of MOFs to efficiently generate complex new structures, with proven efficacy in carbon capture applications."

This is particularly important as typical MOF unit cells may contain on the order of 100s of atoms. The authors first embed the building blocks using a model trained on contrastive learning loss. The latent vector is then used to condition a denoising diffusion model to generate CG representations of MOFs. CG represents are converted back to MOFs using a novel assembly algorithm.
