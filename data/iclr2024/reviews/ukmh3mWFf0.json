                "value": "This paper introduces a new method for clustering attributed graphs. The method is heavily based on a recent graph coarsening method, termed Featured Graph Coarsening (FGC), which was proposed by Kumar et al (2023) for coarsening attributed graphs. The authors in this paper introduces a modularity-based regularization term to the original optimization objective of FGC, and empirically show that the new formulation is useful for clustering attributed graphs. In addition, the authors demonstrate graph neural networks (GNNs) can be integrated in the proposed framework to further enhance the clustering performance."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- Given that the proposed optimization objective in Equation 5 comes from simply adding a modularity-based regularization term $\\mbox{tr}(C^TBC)$ to the original objective function of FGC (Kumar et al, 2023), the originality of this work is very limited, both methodology-wise and technical-wise. It looks like this paper simply (1) adds a regularization term to an existing work and (2) conducts some experiments on a few selected datasets. If there is something very novel, I would recommend the authors emphasize on those aspects. \n\n- The overall quality/clarity of this paper can be significantly improved. First of all, there are a couple of ambiguous statements and overstatements. Here are some examples:\n  - On page 1, in the second paragraph, the authors say that \"... the Fiedler vector (the eigenvector of the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian) produces a graph cut minimal in the weights of the edges (Fiedler, 1973).\" As a reader I find it difficult to understand what \"a graph cut minimal in the weights of the edges\" means in this context. If the authors mean minimum cut, then I don't think this statement is correct. The relationship between the Fiedler vector and the minimum cut is not mentioned in the original paper (Fiedler, 1973), and in general it does not give rise to a minimum cut.\n  - On page 1, in the second paragraph, the authors say that \"... they assume each node gets mapped to one cluster, which is not consistent with real graph data.\" This is a clear overstatement. As far as I know, most of the node classification benchmarks used by the GNN community has non-overlapping clusters/classes. These include the 3 citations networks in Table 1, and several other attributed datasets from Table 3 in the appendix.\n\n  In addition, the presentation can be greatly improved if proper definitions/citations are provided in the right place. Here are some examples:\n    -  The term Feature Graph Coarsening (FGC) first appears at the end of page 1 without a citation. The authors should cite Kumar et al (2023) here.\n    - Similarly, the abbreviation GNN appears at the end of page 1, but the full definition \"Graph Neural Network (GNN)\" only appears much later in Section 2, at the end of page 2.\n    - In the first paragraph of Section 3.3, it is unclear what \"the volume of inter-cluster edges\" means. The authors should define it.\n    - In Equation 1, the expression $\\delta(c_i,c_j)$ is not defined.\n    - In the first paragraph of Section 4.1, it is unclear what \"the original graph is smooth\" means. If the authors mean that the graph has smooth signals, they should just say \"the original graph has smooth signals\".\n\n  There are also many typos and misplacements of mathematical symbols. I highly recommend the authors read the paper thoroughly and fix all the typos.\n\n- Empirically, even though the authors compared with a number of other methods as shown in Table 1, the experiments are only carried over 3 small datasets. Table 3 in the appendix has more results on other datasets, but the authors only compare with two other methods, and one of them is just FGC.\n\n- The proposed method has a lot of parameters, i.e. $\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma,\\lambda$ in Equation 5. It is unclear how to select these parameters and how robust are the results with respect to the choice of these parameters."

Additionally, there is an inconsistency between the motivation presented in the introduction and the abstract. For example, Dirichlet energies are stated in the Abstract, but they are not mentioned in Section Introduction. Besides, the reasons for using them are not explained. Reorganizing the abstract and introduction is recommended, particularly in the section discussing the motivation.\n\n3) The novelty of this paper is not strong. The proposed method for improving the performance of graph clustering relies on modifying the existing FGC method. Furthermore, the paper fails to explain the shortcomings of the current FGC method and how incorporating modularity would enhance its performance. Overall, the impact of this paper on the field is not significant.\n\n4) The related work section is not comprehensive enough. For instance, the paper does not cite important references such as Kumar M, Sharma A, Saxena S, et al. \"Featured Graph Coarsening with Similarity Guarantees\" presented at ICML 2023.\n\n5) The experimental section lacks sufficient detail in its description. For example, the experimental setup is missing information. More specifically, the authors did not provide detailed experimental settings for the baselines. Additionally, the experimental section merely presents the experimental results without providing an explanation for the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in this paper.\n\n6) The writing of the paper needs to be improved.

                "value": "I don't know whether this paper is intended to be read by people from the field of community detection, but I can confirm that this paper is very hard to understand for someone with that background.\n\nThe introduction gives a bad overview of community detection. It does not refer to a good reference for modularity [1]. And it mentions that \"In theory, a higher value of modularity is associated with better quality clusters.\", which is a puzzling statement because modularity is a heuristic that does not have a strong theoretical underpinning. In addition, the paper mentions that the usage of modularity maximization has \"plummeted over the years because they rely solely on the topological information\", which I don't think is the case. Modularity maximization is still one of the most widely-used community detection methods, despite theoretical shortcomings [2,3]. Finally, it is mentioned that modularity maximization \"requires intensive computations\", but the Louvain algorithm runs in nearly linear time, and you can't really go faster than that.\n\nThe \"Deep Graph Clustering\" paragraph of the introduction is incredibly difficult to understand. It uses a lot abbreviations like ARGA, ARVGA, DAEGC, SDCN that are not (properly) introduced. After reading it, I still have no idea what is meant with \"Deep graph clustering\".\n\nThe NMI measure is biased towards fine-grained clusterings [4], while ARI also has its disadvantages [5]. I would recommend to use AMI and/or the correlation coefficient to measure the similarity between clusterings [5].\n\nThe paper contains many typo's, language and notation errors. \n\nThey refer to Supplementary D for a summary of the datasets, but Supplementary D does not describe datasets at all.\n\n[1] Newman, M.

                "value": "What is the difference between graph clustering, community detection and graph coarsening? The way I understand it, community detection is merely clustering of graph nodes based on the graph topology. Graph coarsening (as described in this paper) seems to be similar to blockmodeling [1]. At any rate, the differences between these three things (that seem to be combined in this paper), need to be clearly explained.\n\nThe method makes use of the constraint $X=C\\tilde{X}$. If we substitute this constraint into the first term of (5), it would simplify to\n$\\text{tr}(\\tilde{X}^\\top C^\\top\\Theta C\\tilde{X})=\\text{tr}(X^\\top\\Theta X)$, which would simplify the optimization significantly. However, instead of enforcing this constraint exactly, the paper simply introduces an error term $\\|X-C\\tilde{X}\\|$, which seems unelegant to me. Why don't you enforce this constraint exactly?\n\nYou mention that the log determinant term can be written as the sum of the log of the eigenvalues, and that this ensures that a 'minimal' number of eigenvalues are zero. However, doesn't this ensure that *not a single* eigenvalue is zero?\n\nIs the complexity that is described in the \"Complexity analysis\" paragraph the complexity of a single iteration or of all the iterations until convergence?\n\nI see that you rescaled the NMI, ARI and modularity to percentages. This is okay for NMI (though I'm not a fan of it), but for ARI it is confusing because ARI can be negative. For modularity, I have no idea how this rescaling is done, because the upper bound of modularity is smaller than 1 (and incredibly expensive to compute).\n\nWhy do you draw lines in Figure 2b instead of making a table? The points that are connected don't correspond to consecutive things.\n\n[1] Peixoto, T. P. (2019). Bayesian stochastic blockmodeling. Advances in network clustering and blockmodeling, 289-332."
