It evaluates the ability of LLMs to understand long sequences and perform tasks in different languages and context lengths. The benchmark includes five different abilities and five different context length ranges. The results show that current LLMs still struggle to understand long-context information, and the performance of different models varies in different context length ranges and languages. The benchmark also delves into the factors influencing long-context understanding capability, including the positioning of relevant information and the performance of LLMs under different languages."

It is also good to include the max. length number in it.\n\nThe observations from the evaluation in the paper are weak and uninformative, except that the existing LLMs struggle to process long inputs, and ChatGPT performs the strongest among all. These can be shown from other existing benchmarks as well.\n\nThe categorization and organization of different ranges of sentences lengths can also be done in other similar benchmarks.\n\nThe most interesting point introduced in the paper is to categorize inputs to 5 abilities, explicit single-span, semantic multi-span understanding. However, it is unfortunate that there is an unclear analysis with little informative points in the paper in terms of this point.\n\nList a few unclear points.\n1.\tFor example, M4LE spans different domains and tasks, while the evaluation does not consider these points, e.g. specific analysis on the different impacts of QA, translation.\n\n2.\tBesides, it shows the situations from 3 types of tasks are different. There can be more sophisticated explanations and experiments to furnish further ideas.\n\n3.\tIn Figure 2, why most models perform worse on explicit multi-span understanding compared to both semantic multi-span and global context understanding?\n\n4.\tFrom the results in the paper, ChatGPT is the strongest ones in processing long-context inputs, which is much large in its size. However, only 13B models are evaluated in the paper. It is still unclear that whether larger models can perform much better, e.g. LLaMA2-70b.\n\n5.. The paper seems to have no detailed report about how to construct the benchmark, for example, which instances I will consider to combine them together, or I will choose them randomly? how the number of instances N is decided? In that case, I will think that\nthe M4LE just simply combine the small datasets together to build long-context datasets, where most of them have no relevance between each other. It means that M4LE is a benchmark mainly tests the retrieval ability over long-context but less consider the comprehensive understanding over the global context.\n\n6. In the experiments on different language, the authors claim that Vicuna and Long-chat exhibit a more pronounced performance drop in Chinese. However, in Figure 4, the drops of these models between these two languages have no obvious difference. For example, Vicuna-13B-1.5-16k declines greatly both in English and Chinese after 4k length.\n\n\nMaybe I miss something. I am confused that M4LE is seemingly built from existing web sources, which LLMs are exposed to during training. How does it alleviate the data leakage problem, which also exists for other benchmarks?"

This is because the dataset is mainly composed of short texts synthesized into longer documents, which is not typically how users interact with long-context language models. They are unlikely to use such synthesized long documents as inputs. Moreover, this dataset is evidently more beneficial to models trained on these synthesized short texts, therefore introducing a potential bias.\n\n2. The experimental results can not convince me.  The authors claim that when we scale up the input context from 1k tokens to 8k tokens, the results continuously decrease which is interesting. However, when the answer does not appear at the beginning of the document, gpt3.5-16k usually outperforms gpt3.5-4k.\nI think the potential reasons are as follows:\n(1) Unfair metrics. This paper mainly uses n-gram matching metrics like ROUGE and F-1 which may not correlate with human evaluation results.\n(2) Position bias in the dataset construction. Most answers are at the beginning of the document, additional input is noise.\n(3) The current long context models indeed cannot handle many input tokens but how is the Llama2-4k?\n\n3. The authors simply left the main results in the appendix without analysis. For example, I find that in many tasks even a 6B model can outperform gpt3.5 by a remarkable margin. More analysis can make us better understand current long context models."
