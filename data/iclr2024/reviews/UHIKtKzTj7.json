                "value": "This paper introduces PAPM, a spatio-temporal model to capture complex dynamics which arguably follow similar patters, i.e., a mixture of diffusion and/or convection flows, internal and external source terms. The PAPM architecture encodes the state of the system, and depending on the problem at hand applies either localized, spectral, or hybrid operators to parameterize the different operators. Subsequently, time-stepping schemes are applied to mimic temporal updates. PAPM is tested on 4 known 2D fluid mechanics benchmarks systems."

For such systems standard models such as modern U-Nets and / or convolutional based neural operators should be used for comparison (Raonic et al, Gupta et al), or even Vision Transformers. An alternative is to showcase resolution independency to justify the comparisons. \n- I am pretty puzzled by the low number of parameters. It seems that hardly any model uses more than 1 million parameters. This is in my opinion a heavy under-parameterization for 2D problems. Compare for example Fig 1 in Gupta et al?\n- The paper makes a strong claim for better physics modeling, i.e., strong physics bias, yet there is no evidence that with low number of samples the performance is better compared to baseline models.\n- Figure 6 is not comparing to the best baseline model but FNO which has 10 times worse performance than Dilated ResNets on the RD2d task.\n- It is impossible to judge how the individual components contribute to the results - ablation would help.\n\n\nRaoni\u0107, B., Molinaro, R., Rohner, T., Mishra, S., & de Bezenac, E.

Following are questions which can help authors identify what the reviewer is struggling with, hopefully to help update the paper for a wider audience.\n1. Why are the dynamics/equations of the process model unknown? Isn't it defined by the practitioners?\n2. In relation to 1, it seems that authors consider dynamics which take the form of eq.1, while the exact values that these quantities take are unknown? Is this true? \n3. How are process models different from the proposed model in relation to eq1 and Fig. 3?\n\n### Understanding PAPM:\n4. \\lambda is defined as \"coefficients\" in sec 4.1, but it is unclear how they related to eq 1.\n5. During training the quantities, t, \\lambda, \\Phi_0 etc. are available, but during inference, what all inputs are assumed to be available?\n6. What is the impact of missing quantities on training, can the model still learn?\n7. The structures in Fig 3 (b and c) are still blackboxes, how do these assist in understanding the system as opposed to a process model?\n\n\n### Minor/semantics/other comments:\n1. Why use TSSM for temporal-spatial modeling method (TSSM), TSMM or TSM is more appropriate?\n2. The acronyms DF, CF, IST, and EST can be defined just below eq(1) for clarity.\n3. Decomposing pde as spatial and temporal modules has been studied in PIML. It is important to discuss these similarities in the present work; see Seo 2021. \n\n\nSeo et al. 2021, Physics-aware Spatiotemporal Modules with Auxiliary Tasks for Meta-Learning, IJCAI 2021."
