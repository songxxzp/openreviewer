To build a robust model against attacks with a large budget, authors introduce a robust and unbiased estimator by minimizing an objective function with a minimax concave penalty. Subsequently, an efficient Quasi-Newton iterative algorithm is used to optimize the objective function, from which RUNG is derived. Experimental results demonstrate that RUNG outperforms the baseline (defense) GNNs on CoraML and Citeseer, under most attack settings."

However, the experiments are only conducted on two small graphs, making it unclear whether the proposed approach would still work on large graphs.\n- The accuracy improvement under small attack budgets is less convincing. For instance, the accuracy gap between RUNG and the runner-up model is often smaller than the standard deviation, as observed under local attacks with a 20% budget on CoraML. My concern is that RUNG might underperform the baselines with a new random seed, considering that the authors obtained averaged accuracy using only 5 different random splits.\n- Authors have not performed sensitivity analyses on critical hyperparameters such as $\\lambda$ and $\\gamma$.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The paper posits that $\\ell_1$-based robust estimation introduces an estimation bias, which purportedly deteriorates model performance, especially when an attacker adds heterophilic edges. This foundational claim lacks clarity and remains unproven. The assertion that the unveiled estimation bias explains the significant performance degradation under large attack budgets is inadequately substantiated.\n\nIn the numerical simulations, \"clean samples\" and \"outlier samples\" are generated using a Gaussian distribution. This illustration raises concerns.\n\n- The designation of red dots as outliers is perplexing. There's no discernible reason to not categorize the red dots as clean samples. If we were to accept this alternate categorization, the entire example would be questionable.  Furthermore, when the third plot indicates that 80\\% of the data are outliers, the persistence of the estimation at the center of the blue dots raises concerns. Such behavior might be influenced by factors not elaborated upon in the paper. Consequently, it's premature to commend this as a positive outcome of the proposed method.\n\n\n- The proposed method offers only a rudimentary approximation of one step in GNN aggregation (7). Even if the example were valid, it doesn't convincingly demonstrate robustness in GNNs. Given that $W^k$ fundamentally varies for each $k$, there's no assurance that the single-step gradient descent aligns with the theorem.\n\n2. The computation of $W$ in eq(7) remains ambiguous. How exactly is it derived?\n\n3. The statement \"which not only provides clear interpretability but also covers many classic GNNs as special cases\" is misleading. The term \"covers\" is inappropriate. The paper doesn't truly encompass classic GNNs as special cases but rather offers an approximate perspective on them through the lens of Graph Signal processing.\n\n4. The paper's limitations are not adequately addressed. Like other defense papers aiming to prune the influence of heterophilic edges, this method likely has restricted applicability, perhaps being best suited for datasets that inherently assume homophily.\n\n5. A glaring omission is the lack of reported computational costs. This oversight leaves readers questioning the practical feasibility of the proposed approach.\n\n6. The experimental section is inadequate. The range of attacks considered is also severely limited. It is imperative to incorporate evaluations against poison and evasion attacks, as well as both white-box and black-box scenarios, and to consider both injection and modification types."
