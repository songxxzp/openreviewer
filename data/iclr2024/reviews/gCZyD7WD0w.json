The main idea is to separate exploration and exploitation policies and introduce a teacher policy that guides the exploration policy not to deviate too far from the teacher's actions. Teacher policy is updated to be the best policy so far by evaluating the exploitation policy at the specified regular interval. The proposed method is evaluated in locomotion and locomotion-based navigation tasks in D4RL Benchmark."

They are mostly already covered in works like [Fujimoto'18; Lee'22; Luo'23]\n- The proposed method needs evaluation rollouts for updating the teacher policy. Then the number of environment interactions required for this evaluation should also be incorporated into the sample count for the proposed method. It's not clear if this is reflected in the current results, and this should be properly computed if they are not because it's not a fair evaluation. Correctly doing this would also make Figure 6(b) analysis more meaningful because it's an important trade-off.\n- The paper is a bit difficult to parse in some parts. There is a room for improving the readability. For instance, Table 4 is difficult to read because it's missing the results of GDE with all the components. Including this could help improving the readability by making not scroll the paper up and down. Figure 5 is not very helpful for understanding the main method and could be improved to intuitively help the readers to understand the main idea. Augmenting the Algorithm 1 to be more self-contained could be helpful for better readability.\n\n[Fujimoto'18] Fujimoto, Scott, Herke Hoof, and David Meger. \"Addressing function approximation error in actor-critic methods.\" In International conference on machine learning, pp. 1587-1596.

It's not a new component proposed in the method so it needs to be included for a fair evaluation.\n- Improving some parts of Table 4, Figure 4 as in Weaknesses could be useful for improving the readability of the paper.\n- In Section 5.5, it's not clear how would the method that ablates a component work. For instance, how would the method work without the exploitation policy? Then what is the main policy you are updating with?

The paper then motivates and designs an algorithm based on IQL, where a decoupled exploration policy collects the online data. The loss for the exploration is based on the TD3 update, in contrast with the AWR loss used for policy update in IQL. However, TD3 update can cause the policy performance to crash, to avoid which a KL penalty with the best exploitation policy (aka teacher policy) is introduced, which also helps take safer actions. Overall, the proposed framework allows for more efficient offline-to-online fine-tuning."

Please see questions for further clarifications. \n\nOverall, I am not entirely sure about the generality of the framework, while the paper claims to be general. For example, if the actor loss for the base algorithm already uses a TD3 update, it is not obvious to me that the decoupled exploration does anything different.\n\nThe main benefit of GDE likely comes from the ability to allow the behavior policy to be updated using TD3, which cannot be done with IQL naively, as Q-values aren\u2019t  trained on OOD actions in IQL. The policy crash at low levels of $\\rho$ is likely because of using TD3 loss with an IQL trained Q-value function. This make the comparison with [2] quite critical. They report fairly sample efficient results, but beyond empirical gains, I suspect most of the benefit in GDE is derived from the fact that using a TD3 update for exploration policy, which improves the policy much faster than AWR update and thus generates better exploration data. CalQL shows that calibrated Q-value functions can allow direct usage of TD3 style updates for policy improvement, without the whole decoupled framework.\n\nOverall I am willing to improve the score for the paper, if some of these conditions can be met:\n\n(1) The phenomenon in 3.2 is established in more environments, with algorithms beyond IQL\n\n(2) Comparisons with CalQL are added, and GDE outperforms CalQL.\n\n(3) Alternately, the framework is shown to be compatible with CalQL, and demonstrates an improvement in the performance over it\n\n(4) Clarifying the writing in Section 4, and confirming that the evaluation rollouts for exploitation policy are duly counted in the fine-tuning budget\n\n\n[1] Beyond Uniform Sampling: Offline Reinforcement Learning with Imbalanced Datasets.

This issue seems to be part of the desiderata\n- Section 3.2: This is an interesting point, but might be worth rephrasing the open question  \u201chow to leverage prior knowledge without hurting performance\u201d to clarify how to best use offline data during online fine-tuning. Figure 3 (a) is quite interesting. Am I understanding it correctly that for IQL and SAC, the policy and Q-values are pre-trained (using IQL and CQL respectively on the offline data), but removing the offline data during online fine-tuning and collecting data in the replay buffer from scratch improves the performance and efficiency during training? Can you reproduce this phenomenon on other environments, potentially AntMaze or Kitchen environments? Would this be less of a problem if the offline data contained higher proportion of expert trajectories? One possible way to continue using offline data during online fine-tuning is to rebalance the offline distribution, sampling more relevant transitions more frequently. See [1].\n\nFor Table 1:\n- Can you report the default IQL performance for comparison, ie, IQL that continues to use offline data naively during online fine-tuning? If using the official code for IQL, please note that it is not setup to fine-tune on locomotion environments, as the reward using during offline and online fine-tuning are different. Fixing that is important before reporting the IQL fine-tuning results.\n- Can you report the average performances as well (clustering locomotion envs, antmaze environments)?\n\nSection 4:\n- The clarity of writing in this section can be improved as it is missing quite a few details \u2014 more explicit details would greatly improve the understanding of GDE + minimizing or defining notation clearly with \\phi, \\mu, \\hat{\\phi}, \\bar{\\phi}\n- Is exploration policy initialized randomly?\n- How many trials are done for evaluation? Are those trials counted towards the budget for online fine-tuning? Are you evaluating every 2500 (Appendix B3) steps or 25000 steps (Table 7)?\n- How is the exploitation policy updated over the course of training? What does \u201cexploitation policy pi_e which is responsible for policy extraction from newly collected online samples mean\u201d? Is it updated only on the online samples or does it continue to use offline samples?\n- Do the exploration policy and exploitation update on the same value functions? I understand that this is possible to do for IQL where the Q-values are trained using the replay buffer data and does not query the policy, but if you use a different base algorithm, for example, CalQL, would this still make sense?\n- Which policy is used for reporting the performance?
