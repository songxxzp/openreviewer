                "value": "While the paper discussed how to implementat nested sampling, the exact details of the implementations are not self-contained within the paper. Therefore, it is difficult to actually grasp *how* the paper is proposing to implement these parts. I expect a paper of this type to be self-contained in terms of details. While the authors do provide code, (note that the reviewers are not expected to look at the supplementary material) the paper should explain the algorithmic details, provide insight, and contrast with previous implementations. The paper mostly relies on textual explanation, which lacks the required technical preciseness. Below are some specific examples:\n\n* Section 3 \"Adaptive Time Step Control\": \"This time step is adjusted dynamically ... increase or decrease ...\" How is it adjusted exactly?\n* Section 3 \"Trajectory Preservation\": What is exactly a \"trajectory\" here? It is the states of the Markov chain after multiple Markov chain transitions? Or the intermediate states of a Hamiltonian trajectory as in recycled MCMC methods [1]?\n* Section 3 \"Trajectory preservation\": \"select a new live point at random from the stored trajectories\" how random? Uniformly at random? Or weighted resampling as in typical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo implementations [2,3]?\n* Section 3 \"Pruning Mechanism\": \"This mechanism significantly improves the computational efficiency\" How/why does it improve the computational efficiency exactly?\n* Section 3 \"Differentiable Programming\": How is differentiable programming used here? Why does it help?\n\nFurthermore, for quantatitive/theoretical claims, quantatitive/theoretical evidence (rigorous if possible) is necessary. There are multiple claims that were not entirely obvious to me:\n\n* Section 3 second paragraph: \"the fact that gradients guide the path means one no longer requires $n_{\\text{live}} \\sim O(d)$\": I'm not sure if this is obvious. Is there a proof for this statement?\n* Section 3 \"Mode Collapse Mitigation\": \"... preventing them from converging prematurely to a single model\": Is there theoretical/empirical evidence for this? \n* Section 3 \"Robust Termination Criterion\": \"terminate ... has decreased by a predetermined fraction from its maximum value\": What is the theoretical principle behind this termination criterion?\n* Section 6: \"gradient-guided nested sampling ... makes use of the power of ... parallelization for significant speed improvements\": I couldn't find any empirical evidence on much this method takes advantage of parallelization. Did the authors measure the strong scaling of this method? Until how many cores does this scale? What is the efficiency? \n \nLastly, I found the experiments inconclusive both in terms of experimental design and the choice of baselines.\n* The paper claims that \"the ingredients in GGNS ... to significantly improve its performance in high-dimensional settings ...\" but none of the experiments are necessarily high-dimensional in todays standard. For instance the synthetic experiments in Section 4.1 Figure 1 only go as high as 128. See [4] Section 4.5 where the dimensionality goes as high as tens of thousands. While the method could be said to be scalable among nested sampling algorithms only, one could then question the significance of making nested sampling more scalable where more scalable alternatives exist.\n* The exact contribution of each design choices in Section 3 are not evaluated independently. Therefore, it is unclear how much each of the components are contributing to any performance improvement. Given that no theoretical evidence is provided, I would expect a thorough empirical analysis and motivations for the design decisions. A great example of this is the no-u-turn sampler paper [5], which provided two innovations: tuning the trajectory length and the stepsize. They provide separate evaluation for each: Figure 3,4 for tuning the stepsize and Figure 5 for the trajectory length.\n* Furthermore, some of the baselines are unclear. In Section 4.2, the paper states that HMC was used as a baseline. But HMC alone does not produce an estimate for the log-evidence unless special tricks are used like the harmonic mean estimator or Chib's method. How was HMC used to produce a log-evidence exactly? Similarly, the paper cites Halton (1962) for sequential Monte Carlo, but this paper seems unrelated to the sequential Monte Carlo used for estimating log-evidences as in [6]. Was this the intended citation? People usually attribute the genesis of sequential Monte Carlo to the bootstrap particle sampler [7] or the later seminal works [8,9]. \n* Moreover, the baselines are insufficient to really judge the performance of the method. At least in statistics, log-evidence estimation is popularly done using thermodynamic integration or bridge sampling [10]. Also, if the authors did intend to compare against sequential Monte Carlo as in [6], more implementation details are needed to really judge its validity, since SMC is notable for being sensitive to implementation details.\n* It is also curious why the authors did not use the same set of baselines for all problems. For instance, comparable nested sampling methods are only used in Section 4.1.\n\n### Minor Comments\n* Section 1 first paragraph: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo was initially developed by Duane et al. [11].\n* A similar reflective version of the HMC algorithm was developed by [12], although they did not consider the nested sampling setting. The authors might be interested to take a look.\n\n### References\nI am not the author of nor affiliated with the authors of the following papers.\n1.
