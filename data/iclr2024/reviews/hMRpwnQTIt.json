Moreover, when using the MCTS algorithm to generate the examples-performance pairs, it has to make inference for each combination. This seems to be costly in terms of both tokens and GPU fees, especially in the time when using LLMs as a service. \n2. When making predictions, the proposed method needs to iteratively select question-answer pairs from the example pool using the \u201cvalue function\u201d. This introduces a latency in inference time. The authors should provide some information about the cost of their method. \n3. The experimental evaluation is insufficient. The authors only perform experiments on four datasets, which is not enough to draw a solid conclusion. More experiments should be conducted and compared with related work [2][3].\n4. The experiments should also include out-of-distribution tasks, especially considering that the \u201cvalue function\u201d needs to be trained for every dataset.
