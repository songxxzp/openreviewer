Only later in the manuscript, $C_k$ is defined as rungs.\n\n    **Section 7.1:** Hyperband is mentioned, but the plot shows iSHA and PASHA, I am not sure how to understand the sentence.\n    \n- While the authors do mention sample and evaluation efficiency in the related work, they do not provide an introduction to methods that combine both. For example, model-based methods that do not adhere to a SHA schedule [1][2] but use a dynamic budget allocation, or methods that sample the fidelities together with the hyperparameter configurations [3].\n    \n    **As such, I consider the related work rather incomplete.**\n- Only one baseline is included in the experiments.\n- I believe the future belongs to methods that do not follow a static schedule, but a dynamic one. Since with a static schedule, even if a hyperparameter configuration were to diverge/stagnate, one would still need to follow the schedule. As such I believe the work will not have an impact in the field.\n- Considering the SHA schedule, there are 2 parts, the max budget and the min budget that a configuration will be run to evaluate the performance (the min budget in this case would correspond to the first rung). The authors describe how to increase the max budget, when there is already an existing run, in this example, one could reuse the results from before instead of running everything from scratch. However, what is more important in my perspective, is how to define the $r_{min}$ for the initial run, since that is the fidelity that should be representative of the performance of a hyperparameter configuration.  \n\n[1] Wistuba et al. \"Supervising the multi-fidelity race of hyperparameter configurations.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 13470-13484.\n\n[2] Kadra et al. \"Power Laws for Hyperparameter Optimization.\" Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\n\n[3] Kandasamy, Kirthevasan, et al. \"Multi-fidelity bayesian optimisation with continuous approximations.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

It then completes each bracket using the SH algorithm. This allows partial reuse of previous runs, speeding up the process. \n\nThe paper also provides theoretical analysis for both ASHA and iSHA. Experiments comparing iSHA to PASHA are done on four different search spaces.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The method to continue SH is relatively straight-forward. Other equally simple methods are not discussed. Just one example: Assume we have 2N completed brackets and we want to increase the budget from R to 2R. What we could do is merge the 2N brackets into N brackets and only run SH for the newly introduced level. Then continue with SH as usual.\n\nThe claim that their method outperforms ASHA lacks evidence. The asynchronous issues with ASHA are less relevant given the massive parallelization speedups. In my opinion, the fact that iSHA is synchronous is a strong limitation.\n\nThe empirical analysis in the paper focuses only on PASHA, SH, and iSHA. However, it would strengthen the work to include the following additional baselines for comparison:\n\n- ASHA: As the authors mention, ASHA is an important algorithm to include. Its performance compared to PASHA, SH and iSHA should be analyzed. If ASHA was already included and I missed it, please point me to where it is discussed.\n\n- Training top k configurations (for k=1,...): Evaluating performance when simply training the top k configurations found by SH for a larger budget would provide a naive but fast and likely competitive baseline. This would demonstrate the value of more sophisticated methods like iSHA. \n\n- Naive continued SH: An additional baseline could be to continue SH and ignore that previous runs are incomplete. If the configuration with highest val score happens to be among the incomplete ones, just train until completion.\n\n\nComparing only accuracy or budget is insufficient - a scatter plot on budget vs performance axes, counting the number of times one method dominates the other, would be better.\n\nFigure 3 is unreadable. It's impossible to quantify dots above or below the 0 line.\n\nOverall, the empirical methodology needs more baselines and better evaluation metrics to demonstrate advantages. In particular, a comparison to ASHA is missing."

The idea is to evaluate a set of configurations for a minimum resource budget, e.g. one epoch, and then to discard the worst half and continue the better half for twice as much budget. This process is iterated until either only a single configuration survives or until some maximum budget is reached.\n\nWhile very successful in practice, a caveat of successive halving is how to set the minimum and maximum budget before the optimization process starts. For example, setting the maximum budget too small might lead to premature termination of hyperparameter configurations, whereas too large values lead to a high resource consumption. This paper presents a modification of successive halving that allows adapting the maximum budget during optimization, such that a previous run of successive halving is continued without rerunning previous evaluated configurations."

First, the introduction lists all the relevant hyperparameters of successive halving but the proposed method only adapts the maximum budget. It's not clear why this is more important to adapt than, for instance, the minimum budget. The paper would benefit from discussing this choice. \nIt would also be helpful if the paper could show some realistic use cases where it is unclear how to set the maximum budget or where a poorly chosen maximum budget leads to severe performance loss. Especially given that most benchmarks in the literature provide a predefined maximum budget, demonstrating scenarios where this causes issues would strengthen the motivation. \n\n\n\n\n- The empirical evaluation in the paper could be strengthened in a few ways:\nFirst, directly comparing the proposed method to ASHA would make the results more convincing, rather than just reporting PASHA outperforms ASHA from the previous work. Reproducing a comparison to ASHA demonstrates good scientific practice.  \nSecond, while the method achieves a reduction in runtime compared to SHA, the decreases are relatively modest at 25% for \u03b7=2 and 15% for \u03b7=3. Providing additional experiments on more complex tasks/datasets could help show if the benefits of PASHA scale to more difficult optimization problems."
