However, I don't feel this is fair since the author's approach is seeing a few positive examples. Would be great to have a baseline that uses a similar number of examples.\n\n(2) The tasks focus on some basic properties of molecules like water solubility. However, often what we are really interested in drug design is a quantitative measurement like the binding affinity to a given target (or something similar). I don't see any results along these lines.\n\nIn small molecules there exist benchmarks that measure the binding to specific targets or other more detailed attributes. For example the datasets/baselines used in this paper:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07632.pdf\n\n----\n\n(Maybe less related since the paper's focus seems to be more on small molecules with proteins a secondary experiment) For  proteins there exist benchmarks like Deep Mutational Scanning and FLIP and associated works that try to optimize a protein towards one of these attributes.\n\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.09.467890v1\n\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.09.450648v2\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04562\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00494"
