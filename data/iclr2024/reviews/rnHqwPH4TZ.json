                "value": "This paper proposes a technique called trajectory stitching (T-Stich) to reduce the overall inference time of DPMs while maintaining the generation quality. The method is mainly designed based on two insights. First, differently-sized models trained on the same data distribution share similar encodings thus one can switch between these models during the denoising steps. Second, although the smaller models have lower generation quality than larger models, they are sufficient in earlier denoising steps which generate image global structures. Thus, the proposed T-Stich method reduces the inference time by utilizing a smaller and faster model in the earlier steps and switches to the more capable but more expensive larger model in later steps and controls the trade-off between quality and speed by adjusting the fraction of steps using the large model. Experiments on different pre-trained DPM models show the proposed method can reduce the latency while maintaining generation quality. In addition, it shows using a general model in the early steps and a stylized model in later steps can provide better prompt alignment than completely using the stylized model."

However, there is not enough justification or comparison to other baseline approaches. How does it compare to more flexible baselines, e.g. interleaving strong model steps and weaker model steps throughout the whole process, or gradually reducing the probability p of using the weaker model e.g. from p=1 at t=T to and p=0 at t=0?\n\nW2. Lack of comparison to other related works on multi-expert DPM approaches like [1] and [2]. Under the same inference time budget, how does the proposed approach compare to [1]? Does using a larger pre-trained model in the earlier steps and using a smaller model in later steps have better or worse generation quality compared to [1] which adopts differently designed architectures tailored toward the low-frequency features for the earlier steps or the high-frequency information for later denoising steps?\n\nW3. In Figure 15, even the simple baseline of directly reducing the sampling steps outperforms the proposed method at the 10-50 steps range for s=1.5 and 10-20 steps range at s=2.0. This means the T-stitch approach could achieve better generation quality and latency tradeoff if combined with reducing steps and this was not investigated. More importantly, this result shows the proposed t-stitch approach does not have a strong performance even compared to this simple baseline and more comparisons to other approaches in the literature like [1] and [2] are needed.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Y.

The motivation for this work was the observation from prior works that different DPMs trained in the same data distribution learn similar score estimation regardless of model sizes and architectures. Further investigations show the frequency bias of diffusion models at varying noise levels. Altogether, this motivates this work to stitch the early sampling trajectory from smaller models with ones of larger models, where smaller models and larger models correspond to global shape and local textures, respectively.\n\nThe proposed technique accelerates the sampling speed by 40% w/o quality degradation or retraining. It is also complementary to advanced diffusion samplers based on better ODE discretization. Surprisingly, T-Stitch improves the prompt alignment of stylized latent diffusion models (LDMs)."

The results demonstrate it is broadly applicable across model architectures.\n\n- It proposes a method called \"Trajectory Stitching\" (T-Stitch) to accelerate sampling in pretrained diffusion models without loss of quality. The key idea is to use a smaller, faster diffusion model for the initial sampling steps and switch to a larger, higher quality model later in the process.\n- It is based on the observation that different diffusion models trained on the same data distribution learn similar latent representations, especially in early sampling steps. So the small model can handle the initial coarse sampling while the large model refines details later.\nExperiments show T-Stitch can accelerate sampling in various diffusion architectures like DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc without quality loss. For example, with DiT models it allows replacing 40% of steps with a 10x faster model without performance drop on ImageNet.\nT-Stitch also improves prompt alignment in finetuned diffusion models like stable diffusion. This is because finetuning can hurt prompt alignment which the small general model can complement.\n- The method is complementary to other sampling acceleration techniques like model compression, distillation etc. Those can be applied to the part handled by the large model.\n- T-Stitch achieves better speed vs quality tradeoffs compared to model stitching techniques like SN-Net which permanently stitch model components.
