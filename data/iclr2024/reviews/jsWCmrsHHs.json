It uses a novel graph neural network  to select operations that modify a solution from a set of candidate operations defined by the N5 neighborhood structure. The novel network architecture consists of a topology embedding module and a context-aware embedding module that are designed to encode the problem instances and their solutions. The authors prove that their method scales linearly with the problem size. Furthermore, they evaluate their method on a variety of instances from the literature and compare it to state-of-the-art ML methods, simple handcrafted heuristics, and a tabu search using the same neighborhood structure. Overall, the proposed method shows good performance outperforming existing ML methods in most settings."

It proposes a solution based on deep reinforcement learning to learn improvement heuristics, which iteratively refines an existing solution. The authors leverage a disjoint graph representation of the state (which is more complete than that employed in prior works), and propose a GNN architecture for its representation. The proposed MDP formulation chooses a pair of operations to be swapped, and the RL model is trained via the policy gradient. An experimental evaluation is presented, which compares the method with a large set of prior approaches, spanning deep RL, metaheuristic, and exact methods. The evaluation shows favorable results in comparison with these baselines."

The evaluation performed by the authors is very comprehensive (in terms of datasets, instance sizes, baselines, and scenarios). Most importantly, it shows that the method attains excellent performance while requiring a reasonable time budget. It is one of the few cases where opting for the ML model over a classic solver or metaheuristic may actually be preferable in practice."

A different subscript is needed to indicate the machine, and it should be reflected in the figures as well.\n- I was not able to fully understand the transitions induced by the swapping of the two operations, given that it appears to trigger other reconfigurations of the disjunctive graph beyond the two vertices indicated by the action (e.g., the changes to the edges connecting the red machine in Figure 2b). How are these other reconfigurations determined? This further detail should be added in Section 4.1."
