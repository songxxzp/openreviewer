The two poses are quite different - the first contains wrinkles while the second doesn't - but their frequency distribution appears quite similar. Perhaps it would be better to choose a sample with poses that are closer to each other and have more significant differences in frequency.\n* The paper mentioned that even when a subject is in a similar pose, the frequency distributions can still be distinct. This seems contradictory to the motivation of pose-dependent frequency modulation, as one might wonder why pose-dependent frequency modulation would be beneficial.\n\nEvaluations:\n* Are the point locations clearly separated by the learned weights for each part, or are the parts mixed around the joints? It would be best to visualize the weights for the areas where the bones overlap.\n* The novel pose results on MonoPerfCap do not match the numbers reported in DANBO. Is there a setup difference?\n* Table 1 (b) caption seems to be incorrect. Is the ablation study tested on Human3.6M S9, or is it on MonoPerfCap? \n* The ablation should be performed on the complete setup to allow for better comparison with DANBO. Additionally, the current ablation study is unable to determine which specific design element is responsible for the model's improved performance compared to DANBO.\n* Is there a specific reason why NeuMan is not being compared with Template/Scan-based prior methods and HumanNeRF for the template-free method in Table 2? A discussion or quantitative comparison would be better.\n* It would be more convincing to evaluate the performance of the model on the entire ZJU-Mocap dataset rather than a few selected frames.\n\nMinor:\n* The code link seems to be missing."

The key idea that the paper introduces is to modulate the frequencies of the sinusoidal embeddings used to encode input 3D locations, before they are input into the Nerf's MLP for inference, depending on their local position and nearest bones' pose. These are key to modeling fine-grained texture details of folds caused by bone deformation on clothing, etc. To achieve this the authors propose a module to that first encodes the poses of joints via a graph neural network structure and then predict the frequency modulation of a 3D location based on its local bone's encoded GNN features and position in 2D space relative to the skeletal structure. The authors compare the proposed method to several existing competing methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and observe superior performance for their method."

However this paper proposes the original new idea of modulating the frequency bands used in Nerfs to correctly learn to model wrinkles on clothes based on the deforming pose. This idea is conceptually sound and provides an interesting novel insight to the problem of human avatar creation. Modeling the deformation of loose clothing is still a fairly unsolved problem within this domain and hence advances the field forward.\n\nThe proposed solution and experimental methodology are technically sound. The paper will well-written and structured. Many details are described in the supplement. The authors have promised to released the code."

The effect of the improvement in texture quality of the wrinkles with the proposed method are also subtle and hard to really appreciate. The numerical results in Table 2 of the paper correlate with this fact and show marginal numerical improvement in the reported metrics. Do the authors believe these numerical improvements are statistically significant?\n\n2. For the novel view synthesis task, I am curious as to why the authors did not compared against the following several more recent state-of-the-art methods, which result in higher rendering quality.\n\na) Guo et al., Vid2Avatar: 3D Avatar Reconstruction from Videos in the Wild via Self-supervised Scene Decomposition, CVPR 2023.\n\nb) Jiang et al.,  Neuman: Neural human radiance field from a single video, ECCV 2022.\n\nc) Weng et al., Humannerf: Free-viewpoint rendering of moving people from monocular video, CVPR 2022.\n\nd) Yu et al., MonoHuman: Animatable Human Neural Field from Monocular Video, CVPR 2023.\n\n3. Related also to question 2, is why did the authors choose to not report quantitative metrics for geomtric reconstruction quality and compare it to the existing state-of-the-art methods listed in question 2?"

It would have been ideal if the authors had built their method on of the more recent high-quality nerf-based human avatar methods to achieve both overall high-quality and improvements in modeling of surface wrinkles."
