While Section 4.3 provides some ways to mitigate this, but I cannot find what would be the final performance using this \"economic\" version of algorithm. \n\n2. A red flag for me is that, it seems that the proposed methods become less effectiveness when the dataset distillation methods are becoming stronger. More specifically, MTT has higher performance compard to DC and DSA, but it also requires more data to achieve the same level of performance. There could be a chance that this method will become less effective, if not effective at all. I would suggest the authors to benchmark on more advanced methods such as RFAD [r1]  to show the proposed method can still be effective. For example, why did the authors not report performance on IDC in Table 7, while providing IDC's performance in somewhere else like Table 6.\n\n3. How to decide the data dropping ratio in principle? Deciding such a threshold could also bring overhead. \n\n4. Table 9 shows a simple twist can help improve the performance but it seems that the gaps will be drastically closed when the number of IPC increases. \n\n5. It would be better if the authors can provide results of IPC=10 / 50 in Table 15 to show that the dataset can be pruned at higher budgets. \n\n[r1] Efficient Dataset Distillation using Random Feature Approximation"

In particular, they observe that much fewer examples are needed for distillation, proposing several measures \u201cdata utility\u201d that allow for selecting which sample to keep. Experiments with a number of dataset distillation methods (using less samples) on several benchmark datasets (including a couple large scale ones: ImageNet-1K, Kinetics-400) illustrate that indeed the proposed methods of selecting samples can effectively reduce the number of samples used, in some case outperforming using the whole dataset."

                "value": "## S1. Dataset size reduction\nThis paper proposes reducing the amount of data used for dataset distillation to accelerate these methods. In many cases, this is pretty significant; the sound bite the authors use is 0.04% of the full dataset, which while not representative of all scenarios, is nonetheless impressive. This makes them more usable and saves computation. As the authors point out, some of the recent methods are significantly slower than just training the model on the whole dataset. This paper may serve as a good reference for dataset distillation practitioners for doing so more efficiently. See however W2c.\n\n## S2. Experiments\nThe authors demonstrate their findings primarily on 4 dataset distillation methods (with some additional experiments on 3 others) and a number of datasets. Most impressively, they consider datasets that are of relatively large scale (ImageNet-1K + Kinetics-400). Given how large these datasets (I believe ImageNet is 150 GB), the thought of being able to distill these down to something quite small is quite compelling. However, see W3a.\n\n## Miscellaneous:\n- I do like that the authors go beyond the mean-field assumption and look at higher-order interactions, like the impact of diversity. In the extreme case, a high utility sample that is duplicated in the dataset probably shouldn\u2019t be included twice. I am a little disappointed though that the authors more or less punted on a more thorough investigation for future work."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "## W1. Technical rigor\nWhile there are attempts to provide a formal treatment to the problem, the technical rigor of this paper is not satisfactory. \\\na) The terms \u201cutility\u201d and \u201ccapacity\u201d are commonly utilized throughout the paper to describe the value of a particular sample for distillation and how much information a synthetic distilled dataset can hold, including as part of formal definitions. However, the precise definitions of these terms are in fact quite vague and unclear, instead resembling pseudo-information theory. This paper\u2019s usage of utility and capacity in definitions and equations is not appropriate. \\\nb) Concepts of \u201ccritical sample size\u201d and \u201ccritical sample ratio\u201d are introduced, by these are also not precisely defined, which renders the results in Table 1-4 seemingly arbitrary. \\\nc) There are a number of other issues with notation and some of the tables/figures. See Miscellaneous + Questions below.\n\n## W2. Novelty + Significance\na) The proposed method more or less boils down to doing dataset distillation on a subset of the data. The fact that this is more efficient than doing it on the whole dataset isn\u2019t particularly surprising, and that careful selection of data is better than random selection is in line with existing works on data pruning (e.g. [a]). \\\nb) Loss as a measure of utility is more or less the same as techniques commonly used in active learning, or several branches of approaches continual learning (e.g. coreset selection in replay-based approaches, or importance weighting in regularization-based ones [b]). These similarities aren't discussed in the current draft, but should be. \\\nc) The second paragraph of the Introduction is a written a little too harshly. While it\u2019s true that data distillation taking a long time is a bad thing, that doesn\u2019t render it completely unusable as a technique, as there are still applications where the portability of data matters more than having a trained model. Some may argue that the primary utility of dataset distillation is data portability; in many cases, distillation can be done offline, so how long it takes, while still important, is less of a concern. Also, while the \u201c100x longer\u201d statistic is eye-catching, this is also a cherry-picked example that is especially bad, and not necessarily representative of dataset distillation as a whole.\n\n## W3. Experiments\na) One of the headliner claims of this paper is that it is able to extend to larger-scale datasets like ImageNet-1K and Kinetics-400. However, the ImageNet accuracy is ~2% for 1 IPC, and ~9% for 50 IPC. While I understand that this is compressed to a much smaller synthetic set and better than the baseline, this is not anywhere close to how modern methods perform on ImageNet, and not what I consider as \u201cworking\u201d; same goes for Kinetics-400. Simply running a method on a dataset regardless of results is not the same as saying the method works well on it. As such, the claims here are misleading. \\\nb) A common use case of dataset distillation is continual learning. It could have been nice to see some experiments in this setting.\n\n## W4. Writing\nThe writing could use some improvement. There are a number of grammatical or idiomatic errors, and in a number of instances, the word choice implies the wrong thing, which can be distracting. I list out some examples below under \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d, but this is not an exhaustive list. I recommend the authors give this manuscript another careful round of edits.\n\nThe organization of this paper is also somewhat non-standard. Experiments are mixed in through Section 3 (Preliminaries) and 4 (Estimating Data Utility). There is no independent Experiments section. This isn\u2019t necessarily a requirement for writing a paper, but following a more typical separation will help readers more easily find particular content. For example, the current organization is almost chronological in nature, adding new wrinkles or changes to the methodology after pervious benchmarking had already been done. This makes it hard to tell what finally this paper\u2019s contributions are.\n\n## Miscellaneous:\n- pg 1: \u201chas become critical which enables high performance\u201d <= awkward wording\n- pg 1: \u201creduce the model size\u201d <= extraneous \u201cthe\u201d\n- pg 1: \u201cmaintaining the model performance trained on the synthetics\u201d <= I think this is actually trying to say that the goal is to be able train a model on the small synthetic dataset that has similar performance to training the real large dataset.\n- pg 1: \u201cdata utilization\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to be the heart of the issue the authors are seeking to address. If I understand correctly, the authors are more concerned about the efficiency of data compression\n- pg 1: \u201c a natural assumption comes up\u201d <= assumptions are made by choice. Also, what follows is not an assumption, but rather a hypothesis/design choice.\n- Figure 1 right: Rather than have points off the chart, can this be shown in log scale instead?\n- pg 3: \u201cwe first argue that data redundancy is extremely severe in distillation\u201d <= This is not a property of distillation, but rather the dataset for the specific learning task.\n- pg 3: \u201cto support the general the observation\u201d \n- pg 4: Tables 1-4: Methods/architectures should be cited.\n- pg 4: \u201c\u2026 real dataset and we have more freedom \u2026\u201d <= run-on sentence\n- pg 4: \u201c\u2026 high computation cost and MTT exceeds \u2026\u201d <= run-on sentence\n- Figure 3 is confusing.

                "value": "- The paper provides a novel perspective on dataset distillation inspired by information theory and addresses the problem of data redundancy in distillation.\n- The paper conducts extensive experiments and comparisons to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed data utility indicators and selection methods.\n- The paper demonstrates that the proposed method can enhance the performance of existing distillation algorithms and extend them to more challenging scenarios such as ImageNet-1K and Kinetics-400."

It is not clear how they relate to the information content or transferability of data samples.\n\n- The paper does not show significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art distillation algorithms, please check the sota methods in: https://github.com/Guang000/Awesome-Dataset-Distillation . The performance gains are mostly marginal."

Is there a risk of overfitting to a small subset of real data that may not capture the full complexity and variability of the original dataset?\n- How does the proposed method deal with the potential bias or noise introduced by the loss value as a utility indicator?"
