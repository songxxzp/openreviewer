However, in the case of SGD, the upper bounds for mutual information (MI) diverge, making it challenging to apply directly. In this paper, instead of relying on the commonly used auxiliary process technique, the authors enabled information-theoretic generalization error analysis by exploiting the connection between SGD and SDE using full-batch gradients and mini-batch gradients, as a means to address this issue. This is a very intriguing approach with broad potential applications.\n- Through the derived generalization error bounds, this paper provided a theoretical validity for empirically known discussions of the impact of gradient variance on generalization performance and the improvement of generalization performance through control of gradient norms.\n- In the experiments, the analysis not only focuses on the tightness of the bounds but also examines the numerical assessable elements that constitute these bounds. Furthermore, it confirms the close agreement between SGD and SDE. These factors collectively ensure the validity of the theoretical results.\n- From the above, it is evident that this paper is well-written and provides a significant impact in the research field of generalization performance analysis obtained through stochastic optimization."

The paper would have been better if there had been a part discussing the limitations and future prospects related to these issues.\n- The approximation of $\\Lambda_{w*}$ leads to a dependency on the inverse of the learning rate $\\eta$ in the bounds provided in Corollaries 4.1 and 4.2, as well as Theorem 4.2. It seems that these bounds become large or even diverge as the learning rate decreases ($\\eta_t \\rightarrow 0$). A similar problem appears in the sensitivity-based generalization error analysis for SGLD [1]. I guess that the reason for decaying the learning rate only between the 40,000th and 60,000th iterations in the experiments is to prevent the bounds from diverging, as reducing the learning rate too early might cause divergence before the parameters have converged sufficiently."

Can you provide specific examples of loss functions that meet both of these assumptions, excluding bounded losses?\n- As I comprehend it, the generalization error bounds presented in Theorem 3.1, Corollary 3.1, Theorem 3.2, Theorem 4.1, and so forth, within this paper, explicitly or implicitly rely on the parameter dimension $d$. I'm curious about the behavior of these bounds as $d$ grows ($d \\rightarrow \\infty$). Especially, in cases where dimensionality dependence is observed both inside and outside the logarithmic expressions, it appears that these bounds tend to diverge unless factors such as gradient noise are adequately small. Could you please share the authors' thoughts on this matter?\n- Is it feasible to find an approach for approximating $\\Lambda_{w*}$ that eliminates the reliance on the inverse of $\\eta$?\nIs delaying the timing of reducing the learning rate the sole method when numerically evaluating your bounds? I believe there is some relationship between the generalization (or the desired convergence) and the speed of learning rate decay. What is your perspective on these concerns?\n\n## MISC\n- When numerically evaluating generalization errors in experiments, I imagine it involves evaluating the difference in accuracy between the test data and the training data. In such cases, even if the training/test accuracy is low, it's possible for the apparent generalization error to be small. Therefore, if possible, reporting the predictive accuracy after training completion would enhance the reliability of the experimental results (I refer to Appendices H and I in [2] for example).\n- p.4, the paragraph of \"Validation of SDE,\" the 2nd paragraph: an oder 1 strong... --> an order 1 strong... ?\n\n## Citation\n(Note: I am not the author of the following papers)\n\n[1]: T.

It is strange to say a bound on a different object is tighter. More important are the missing discussions of other data dependent bounds established for schemes very similar to the studied noisy GD. For example, the very paper this work builds on has a result on SGLD where the batch noise covariance appears [3, theorem 3.1], comparisons with such results would be more appropriate. Especially since theorem 3.1 in this work is a straightforward application of the method in [3].\n- Interpretability of the bounds: The choice of priors would ideally yield meaningful quantities. Here, aside from obtaining a dependence on trajectory wise gradient norms, a result already known for generic noisy iterative schemes, the paper proves Theorem 3.2 where the alignment between the batch estimate covariance and the population gradient covariance appears. It is difficult to understand why this quantity is interesting as it is not well discussed. Moreover, there should be more discussion on the positive definite assumption because, in practice, for neural networks, there are many more weights than data points, thus making $C_t$ invertible only for large $n$.\n- A mix of informal and formal claims: Throughout the paper, even in the proofs, and especially in section 4, the paper mixes informal and formal results making it quite difficult to track what the result is stating. Approximate equalities $\\approx$ and $=$ are used interchangeably and results that hold in the limit are taken to be valid for a finite T. This is especially felt in theorem 4.1 and lemma 4.1 and its corollaries. The writing and structure of the paper could really be improved.\n- Tenuous links with practice and problems with solely analyzing generalization: The paper makes an effort to link its bounds with practice but is often unconvincing. For instance, concepts such as the \"edge of stability\" are discussed along with experiments simply because a step size and largest singular value appeared together in lemma 4.1 after two obscure assumptions such as commutation of a hessian and a covariance matrix and an ambiguous $\\approx$.  For the trajectory based bounds, it is important to note that the obtained bounds are time dependent, meaning that a single pass over the data can quickly yield a vacuous result so this should be stated well before these bounds are used to try to justify practice. Putting aside the previous points, it is clear from Corollary 4.2 and its interpretation that solely analyzing generalization bounds can quickly loose meaning: yes an algorithm that stays close to initialization generalizes better but so does an algorithm that simply ignores the training data entirely. Over analyzing generalization bounds without thinking of the utility of the algorithm can lead to strange interpretations. \n---\n[1] Neu, Gergely, et al. \"Information-theoretic generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent.\"\n\n[2] Wang, Z., & Mao, Y.

I can only make sense of the results if we exactly have $T = \\infty$.\n- Could you please formally restate the result showing that the noisy GD scheme you analyze converges to a mixture of Gaussians centered at local minima ? It is only briefly discussed with a mention to a result by Mandt et al.\n- In lemma 4.1 are you assuming that there is only a single minimum per sample $S$ ? \n- The results Corollary 4.2 and Theorem 4.2 appear to be algorithm independent as long as the algorithm converges to a distribution over local minima. Is this correct?"
