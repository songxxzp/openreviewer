Here, we use L directly as the lattice representation\"\n\nComment: This conventional lattice representation (three cell edges and three angles between them) is not invariant because any lattice can be generated by infinitely many different cell bases, for example, the basis (1,0),(n,1) for any integer non-zero n generates the same square lattice.\n\nIf we need a complete and invariant description of a periodic crystal, crystallographers solved this problem nearly 100 years ago by using Niggli's reduced cell of a lattice and then recording all atoms in so-called standard settings, see the book \"TYPIX standardized data and crystal chemical characterization of inorganic structure types\" by Parth\u00e9 et al, which actually applies to all periodic crystals, not only inorganic. \n\nHowever, all these standardizations have become obsolete in the new world of big and noisy data because the underlying lattice (not even a unit cell) of any periodic crystal is discontinuous under almost any perturbation, which is obvious already in dimension 1.\n\nFor example, the set Z of all integers is nearly identical to a periodic sequence with points 0, 1+ep_1, ..., m+ep_m in the unit cell [0,m+1] for any small ep_1,...,ep_m close to 0, though their minimal periods (or unit cells) 1 and m+1 are arbitrarily different. \n\nThis discontinuity was reported for experimental crystals already in 1965, see Lawton SL, Jacobson RA. The reduced cell and its crystallographic applications. Ames Lab., Iowa State Univ. of Science and Tech. \n\nA more recent example from Materials Project shows two nearly identical crystals whose unit cells differ by a factor of (approximately) 2\nhttps://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-568619\nhttps://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-568656\n\nTheorem 13 in Widdowson et al (MATCH 2022) proved that any cell (not only Niggli's) reduction is discontinuous hence using a cell basis is hopeless.\n\nMoreover, atoms in any material always vibrate above absolute zero temperature, so their positions continuously change. As a result, any crystal structure with fixed atomic coordinates in a database is only a single snapshot of a potentially dynamic object, especially for proteins whose structures are also determined often by crystallization. \n\nQuote: \"Invariance to permutation: Given the representation R = [Rstr,Ccomp,L], we can permute the atoms within the crystal to obtain an updated representation\".\n\nComment: since a periodic crystal contains infinitely many points, the updated representation will be infinite. Even if only m atoms in a minimal cell are permuted, the representation blows up by the exponential factor of m!, which is also impractical.\n\nSince the paper used PCA in Figure 5, the authors might be interested in learning that any dimensionality reduction is either discontinuous (makes close point distant) or projects an unbounded domain to a single point (loses an infinite amount of data), see the proof in Landweber et al \"On Fiber Diameters of Continuous Maps\", the American Mathematical Monthly, v.123 (2016), p.392-397.\n \nQuote: \"there is no single existing representation that fulfills all three of the conditions mentioned above\".\n\nComment: there are at least two stronger representations that practically fulfill all three conditions and two more important practical requirements of polynomial-time computability and Lipschitz continuity under small perturbations of atoms, see isosets in Anosova et al (DGMM 2021, extended in arxiv:2205.15298) and Pointwise Distance Distributions in Widdowson et al (NeurIPS 2022, extended in arxiv:2108.04798). \n\nIn conclusion, the proposed invariants don't satisfy the practical requirements that were fulfilled by the simpler, stronger, and faster invariants."

The representation space is a result of concatenation of a physically meaningful representation, i.e., Embedded Atom Density (EAD), with explicit information extractable from the coordinate based representation, i.e., composition and lattice parameters. A key step in generating molecules with explicit representations (atom coordinates) is the reconstruction from the proposed representation space. The paper mentions that this is the first use of latents (in contrast to coordinate-based representations) for generating periodic materials. The benefit of the proposed method is that the generated molecules are invariant to different transforms. The results show acceptable performance in terms of reconstruction step as well as generation metrics, such as validity."

For example, it is not clear if the proposed concatenated representation is the idea of this paper or not. I assume it is, but have not seen the paper mention it explicitly. In general, mentioning an explicit list of contributions is recommended. Another example is the reconstruction procedure (section 4.3). While it is a significant part of the proposed method, it is only later in the results section that we understand this step is done through back-propagation using automatic differentiation of an analytical function. \n\n- The paper tries to evaluate its proposed representation in the context of generation. This is Ok. But if the concatenated representation is the key, the focus of evaluation should have been that part. For example, an extensive evaluation of different invariances especially the permutation invariance. \n\n- It is true that running density functional theory might be time consuming, but I think this is necessary for the evaluation.

The goal of materials discovery is to find materials that are a) novel, b) thermodynamically stable, c) have interesting properties. The paper addresses only point a), and only to some extent. There isn't a single DFT calculation run to see if any of these materials would be stable? The word \"stable\" isn't even mentioned.

                "value": "This work proposes StructRepDiff, a novel diffusion-based model for 3D periodic material generation. StructRepDiff uses a denoising diffusion model to generate periodic materials in the form of symmetry-invariant representations, including compsition representation, lattice parameters, and embedded atom density representations. Atom coordinates are obtained by searching coordinates that best match the generated embedded atom density representations with gradient descent. Experiments show that StructRepDiff performs well in reconstruction and random generation of periodic materials."

Experiments on benchmark datasets show the proposed model achieves good performance in periodic material generation.  \n- **Clarity**: The writing of this paper is clear, well-organized and easy-to-follow.  \n- **Significance**: The proposed model is useful for novel material design in a broad range of real-world applications."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- It is not clear how the number of atoms $n$ is obtained from $C_{comp}$ as $C_{comp}$ is normalized by $n$. It is possible that materials with different $n$ may have the same $C_{comp}$. For instance, in $C_{comp}$ of materials with only carbon atoms, only the item for carbon atom is 1 while all other items are zeros, but there may exist different number of atoms $n$ in a unit cell. Authors are encouraged to clarify how $n$ is obtained.\n- There lack many significant details in the presentation of obtaining coordinates from embedded atom density representations in Section 4.3. Authors are recommended to clarify the following details: (1) What is the formula of loss function $L$? (2) What are the gradient descent algorithm, step size, max_initializations, max_hops, and max_iterations used in experiments? (3) What are general range of the loss function values when optimization ends? It would be better to report the mean final loss function values averaged over all generated materials.\n- Table 1 needs  improvements. The column \"Dataset\" should be removed. Italic font type should not be used to the \"P\" under \"RMSE\" to keep consistency.\n- Property optimization is important in real-world problems because real-world applications usually require to generate materials with some target chemical properties. However, it remains unknown how to do property optimization with the proposed model. Authors are encouraged to discuss how to property optimization with StructRepDiff, and explain whether the failure of achieving invertible mapping between material representations and atom coordinates has negative impacts on property optimization.\n- In the fourth line of Section 4.3, authors inappropriately cites their own work as \"following from our earlier work (Fung et al., 2022)\". This leaks the identities of authors and seems to violate the anonymous policies of ICLR."
