                "value": "The authors consider the computed tomography (CT) reconstruction problem. Specifically, they consider a case with strong reflectors in the scene of interest (like a metal implant). When such materials are present, they argue that a preprocessing step that is normally used to obtain a linear inverse problem is not numerically stable. In contrast, they propose to solve the resulting non-convex problem directly through gradient descent. They show that, if the observation matrix were a sample from a Gaussian distribution, and if the number of measurements exceed a lower bound, with high probability, gradient descent converges to the true solution at a geometric rate.\nThey also extend the results to the case where the number of measurements are fewer but this reduction is compensated by a regularizer that captures the structure in the family of signals that the solution belongs to.\nIn an experiments section, they compare their proposed reconstructions against the linearized model (where the Fourier-slice theorem applies)."

They show that a simple approach like gradient descent, targeting a relatively simple reconstruction formulation, can provably solve the original problem under certain constraints. They also extend their results to the case where the number of measurements are reduced at the expense of making certain assumptions about the signal of interest, and come up with clear statements that they can prove. Reducing the number of measurements in CT is always welcome as that reduces the amount of radiation the patient is subjected to."

                "value": "The assumptions made by Theorems 1 and 2, which form the main contribution of the paper do not match well the CT measurement setup. Specifically, in CT, the beams are well-structured, and if we consider the image of a beam, it does not resemble at all a sample from a 2D Gaussian field. Therefore, it's not clear to me how much the results on provable convergence carry over. If the authors can show or argue that the local pseudo-convexity property (in some reasonable neighborhood of the solution) carries over to the deterministic concentrated-beam setting, the connection with CT would be stronger. Since the paper is not concerned with proposing a non-obvious algorithm but proving the usefulness of a rather well-known algorithm, this is a serious shortcoming.\n\nLess importantly, the experiments are not entirely convincing -- I think reconstructions with the linear model could have been improved by including regularizers."

I guess you're referring to modelling $a_i$ to be samples of a Gaussian field, but that's not clear at all at this stage.\n\n2. Page 2, beginning of Section 2, \"(1) we model $a_i$ as a standard Gaussian...\" : This strongly contradicts the opening sentence of Section 2, where you mention \"$a_i$ are sparse, nonnegative, highly structured, dependent on $i$\". What is the motivation behind this modelling? Is it mainly to obtain provable results? I understand some deviation from an accurate model, but this is taking it a bit extreme.\n\n3. The second sentence of Definition 2 (\"Throughout...\") doesn't look like it's part of the definition.\n\n4. Page 5, footnote 1 : It's worth bringing in to the main text and clarifying what $m$ should exceed.\n\n5. In general, I would welcome concrete typical values for the constants $c_i$ that appear in theorems, for specific cases/resolution.\n\n6. Section 5.1 : Can you actually expect to see inside the metal? Here, I think the regularizer plays a more crucial role. What happens if you were to use a regularized formulation but with a linear measurement model (e.g., using one of the iterative solvers like FISTA)?"
