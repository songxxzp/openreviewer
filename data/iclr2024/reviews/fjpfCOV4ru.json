The authors study a quite general class of Markov chains and analyze the upper bound between SDE, which is also a popular research area.\nClarity: the clarity is good. The paper sequentially introduces several auxiliary SDEs/Markov chains to eventually bridge the gap between the processes of interest: $X_k$ and $Z_t$. The motivation of each proposed auxiliary processes are clearly stated and is easy to follow for readers.\nSignificance: The theoretical contribution is quite good for this area. The authors consider non-Gaussian and state-dependent chains which is not so deeply investigated in literature. The window coupling and \"modified\" Girsanov theorem may be of independent interest."

The same issue appears in most of the later equations in this proof.\n - In the same equation, the last two terms have a wrong scaling w.r.t. $S$. Specifically, they should be $4\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\|\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{S}}\\sum_{i=1}^{S-1} \\sigma(X_{Sk}) (\\epsilon_{Sk+i} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{S}}\\zeta_k^S(X_{Sk})) \\right\\|^2\\right]$ and $4\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\| \n\\sum_{i=0}^{S-1}(\\sigma(X_{Sk}) - \\sigma(Y_{\\bar{\\eta}k}^X)) \\zeta_k^S(X_{Sk}) \\right\\|^2\\right]$. Consequently, some following terms should be multiplied by $S^2$ or so. (It seems not to affect the final upper bound, though. It is better to still check the whole roadmap of proofs.)\n - I wonder how the last term in the top equation on page.19 is derived ($4M_0\\|X_{Sk}-Y_{\\bar{\\eta}k}^X\\|^2$). It seems merely using Assumption 1 (4) is not enough. Or maybe there should be some additional assumptions?"
