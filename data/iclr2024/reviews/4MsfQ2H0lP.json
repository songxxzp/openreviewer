This reliance on precomputed structures potentially limits the model\u2019s applicability in real-world scenarios, as it is sensitive to the quality of these precomputed dimers.\n\n2. The protein docking process is simplified to a sequential decision-making problem in the proposed method. Each step in this process is determined by a precomputed dimer. While the precomputed dimers (utilizing AFM or ESMFold) effectively capture bi-interactions, they may not adequately represent the complex interactions that can occur across different chains in a protein complex in real-world settings.\n\n3. There appear to be inconsistencies in some of the comparative results presented. GAPN has the advantage of accessing precomputed/prefetched dimer structures, reducing its task to merely finding a docking path. This setup makes the inference time incomparable to other baselines like AFM and ESMFold, which adopt an end-to-end approach for predicting complex structures. Consequently, the inference speedup showcased in the tables may not translate to tangible benefits in practical applications."

In Section 4.1, the paper mentions that all possible pairs of chains are precomputed or fetched. Could you provide details on the average time spent in this step and the average number of dimer structures generated?\n\n3. In Table 1, it is indicated that GAPN does not optimize the dimer structure. Could this lead to error accumulation, especially if some precomputed dimer structures significantly deviate from the ground truth dimer structures?"
