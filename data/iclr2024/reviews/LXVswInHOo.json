Specifically, they first construct a document graph in which the documents are nodes and edges are valued by the similarity between two documents. Then they employ a greedy strategy to concatenate the documents, i.e., constructing the sequence for language pre-training.\nEmpirical evaluations across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that in-context pre-training consistently surpasses the performance of the baseline, except on close-booked question answering."

As we see better perplexity on language modeling, seems ICLM should memorizes more with the help of relevant documents.\n2. According to the presented results, ICLM outperforms baselines in in-context settings. Experiments in out-of-context setting could be added for us to better understand the proposed ICLM.\n3. The related work section could be improved by discussing a broader range of previous studies.  For example, the first paragraph of Section 5 only refers to three papers to summarize \u2018pre-training with related documents\u2019, however, there are other works with similar ideas including [1] use dictionary as context, [2] use co-occurrence of words across sentences as context for language pre-training, among others.\n\n[1] Yu et al.

Is the approach different in this case because the sequence length is so extensive that most documents cannot fill a single sequence? I would appreciate further clarification on this matter.\n2. Could you provide an estimate of the time required for the graph construction and traversal processes at your experimental scale?\n3. I am intrigued by the scalability of the proposed approach in a practical context. If we receive new raw text data, will we have to repeat the similarity computation, graph construction and graph traversal processes?\n\n[3]  Liu et al.

                "value": "A naive approach to language modeling on large corpora often considers randomly concatenating documents within the corpora together during training, resulting in long contexts which may not be relevant to the current next-word prediction. In this work, the authors conjecture that this naive approach harms a models ability to learn to attend to long-range dependencies during both language modeling, as well as down-stream tasks. To address this, the authors propose In-context pretraining (ICP), which, prior to language model pre-training, groups and sorts document by their similarity such that a language model is trained on several related documents contiguously.\n\nTo perform this grouping, ICP first uses _contreiver_ (a similarity-based retriever model from prior work) to first obtain a set of nearest neighbors for each document. Then the authors propose a modified version of a greedy algorithm to the traveling salesman problem to obtain a path through all the documents such that no documents repeat but most documents will appear next to their nearest neighbors. The resulting path is then treated as the document order for input to the LM, which is split into several contiguous chunks which serve as the pre-training corpora.\n\nThe authors consider two baselines: naive pre-training, which randomly shuffles and concatenates documents together, and kNN pre-training, which groups documents by similarity, but can have high document duplication and overlap.\nThe authors demonstrate that LLMs trained with ICP significantly outperform standard LMs and kNN LMs on both language modeling, as well as on several downstream tasks including in-context learning, reading comprehension, and retrieval augmentation, highlighting the importance of long-range consistency and dependency in LM pre-training."
