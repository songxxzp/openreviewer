Any particular reason why? Why not for all 6? Or, why do you finetune the whole network for those 2 particular datasets?\n- Table 9 and 10 are interesting results, but for which dataset(s) are these results?\n- Section 1, \"its dependency on data augmentation restricts its applicability to domains where effective augmentation techniques are lacking\": I think this should be the other way around, the applicability is restricted to domains where effective augmentation methods do exist?\n- Figure 1 caption, \"encodes input to embeddings\": input --> inputs?\n- Section 3, \"which encodes input to embeddings\": input --> inputs?\n- Personally, I would probably consider modifying the title, making it a bit more descriptive (the current title gives no clear clue that the paper studies the important problem of representation learning for regression)."

I think they may be better than the ERM (vanilla) baseline in the experiments. Besides, the C-mixup method is also closely related in the sense that they choose mixup pairs that are close in function value (albeit without considering ordinality) so its worth a deeper comparison even methodologically. It might provide some insights into the strengths of SupReMix.  For example, does adding ordinality with vanilla mixup or C-mixup boost performance of each method? \n* The framework fundamentally relies on ordering the training data according to function value -- how is this implemented in practice? Is the ordering done on each mini batch? \n* Are the backbone networks trained from scratch or do you use pre-trained variants followed by fine-tuning?\n* A limitation that is unaddressed here, is that the current method does not generalize to even simpler regression problems where the output function has dimensionality $>1$. \n* Finally, I find the notational style in the paper is a bit confusing and not easy to read. It may help the reader to simplify or modify the notation to benefit legibility .. for e.g. indices, function values, embeddings are all in italics which is not typical and hard to distinguish. Please fix these. \n* Figures 1 A and B, do not convey the message of the method clearly.. and is a bit confusing. I think this can be improved to make the proposed method more explicit."

Despite the authors providing extensive comparison results with two directly relevant contrastive learning methods, more related baselines should be compared in various experimental settings. Firstly, the authors adopt the implementation from C-Mixup [4] while not comparing it with it. I suggest the authors add more comparison experiments with existing mixup methods for regression (e.g., Vanilla Mixup, C-Mixup [4], ManifoldMix [5], etc) and general hard sample mining contrastive pre-training methods with mixup augmentations (e.g., MoCHi [2] and i-Mix [3]). Secondly, the authors should not only evaluate on self-supervised pre-training and fine-tuning setting but should conduct the practical training-from-scratch setting as well.\n\n(**W3**) Usage of hyper-parameters. Firstly, many hyper-parameters are used in SupReMix compared to SupCon and mixups for regression tasks. The most widely used mixup augmentations are \n\n(**W4**) Overlook of some related works.
