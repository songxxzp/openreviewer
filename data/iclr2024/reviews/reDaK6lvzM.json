As such, more space can be used to add more experimental results, for instance, failure case analysis.\n\n- Have the authors analyzed in what cases the users prefer to select other methods? It seems that the authors just simply report the numbers but further analysis is not provided.\n\n- The authors claim that the Segment Anything Model is used in the proposed method. \n  - Does this model help better generate high quality images? \n  - If so, how does this model help? I cannot find relevant content to describe this.\n  - In addition, does this model influence the inference speed?\n\n- I also think more results without swapping should be added for visualization.

Given that the proposed method initially samples many images, the baselines should similarly be evaluated by first generating a candidate set and then combining it with PickScore or HPS-v2 to select the optimal image.\n- The combination of two concepts into a surprising new image is an artistic endeavour and very subjective. While the user study indicates that the presented method is favoured more often, the baselines did not have the same chance (see point above).\n- Furthermore, the technical contribution of the presented approach is limited. The equations to select the acceptable sampling region based on CLIP distance are tuned using existing method HPSv2.\n- Small note: the paper states that 5k prompts were randomly selected from the combination of two random concepts (out of 1k imagenet classes), which is pretty small. How does this random selection influence the results and hyperparameters? An analysis on either a much higher prompt pool or several cross-validation sets is necessary for better judgment."

The proposed swapping mechanism constructs a new embedding by exchanging column vectors of two text embeddings, which is then used to generate a combinatorial image using Stable Diffusion. An acceptable region is designed by managing suitable CLIP distances between the new image and the original concept generations, making it more likely to accept high-quality combinations. The authors also employ a segmentation method to compare CLIP distances among the segmented components and select the most promising image from a sampled subset. Experiments are conducted on text pairs of objects from ImageNet, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms recent techniques."

Can the author provide results of similarity evaluated by DINO? Which can better illustrate similarity between the fine-grained details.\n\n\n3.
