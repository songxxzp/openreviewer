More specifically, first, the model is coalesced in both the width and depth direction. Then the large model can be coalesced into a smaller model. Next, to map the parameters back to the original model, the model is depth de-coalesced and then width de-coalesced. Next, after training the smaller model generated by coalescing, it conducts de-coalescing and then merges the coalesced model and de\u2212coalesced model under the control of a hyperparameter. Finally, the merged larger model is trained. The proposed framework is evaluated on both accuracy and speed. The evaluation results show that the framework can keep or even slightly improve the accuracy and reduce the FLOPs and wall time."

This approach is inspired by the observation that training smaller models is more cost-effective and thus the authors propose a solution by generating high-quality intermediate solutions for subsequent larger networks.\n\nSpecifically, the authors propose a V-cycle learning process composed of three operations: Coalescing, De-coalescing and Interpolation. The Coalescing operator reduces the model size in terms of width, followed by depth. The De-coalescing operator is the inverse operation of Coalescing, with the de-coalescing matrices defined as the normalized transposition of the coalescing matrices. To address the low-rank issue present in the transformations, the authors also propose the Interpolation operation, which merges the de-coalesced model into the previous one. The authors suggest integrating the three operations into a V-cycle training framework, which learns to coalesce and train small models and then de-coalesce them into bigger models with Interpolation progressively.\n\nThe authors also provide experimental results on transformer-based models (BERT, GPT) and a vision model (DeiT), demonstrating significant speed-up (up to >50%) in training while maintaining performance."

Additionally, more controlled experiments would be beneficial to substantiate the rationale for choosing heuristically defined mapping matrices over learnable parameters. The interpolation operation, which the authors claim mitigates the low-rank issue encountered in LiGO, is reminiscent of well-known PEFT methods like LoRA. More comparisons with this line of research would enhance the persuasiveness and credibility of the proposed method.\n\nLastly, the authors introduce the multigrid algorithm with a detailed description.

The recover matrices G in equation 7, and T_in and T_out are also manually defined without further explanation or theoretical basis. I feel the key point of this framework lies in modeling the correlation of parameters between large models and small models. I am not very convinced, from a methodological point of view, why the proposed framework can help to converge faster on the training set D.\n\nAside from conserving computational resources, what benefits do the interpolating model M_{k} and the de-coalesced model M_{k, de-coalesced} offer compared to continuing training the de-coalesced model M_{k, de-coalesced}?\n\nAt the end of the algorithm, the M_{1} model necessitates further training to achieve convergence. I'd like to see the computational overhead of this phase, as well as the comparative experimental results after removing this component.\n\nMost efforts of the experiments are on BERT models. Competitive compared methods, say LiGO, are not included in the results of GPT and DeiT in Table2 & 3. \n\nIn Table 4, as the number of Levels increases, the author's method not only saves more computational resources but also further improves the performance of the final model.
