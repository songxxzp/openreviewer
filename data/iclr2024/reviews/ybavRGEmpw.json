The latest baseline used in the paper is proposed in 2020. However, it is 2023 now, there are so many good methods proposed these years. So I think the authors should compare their methods with the latest SOTA method.\n  - There are only **two small** datasets. Firstly, I think the authors should conduct experiments on more datasets to indicate consistent improvement. Secondly, the experiments should be conducted on larger datasets, MNIST is a very easy task, the authors should conduct experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.\n  - The backbone is small, which is not consistent with the word \"deep learning\" in the topic of this paper. Larger neural networks should be used (together with larger datasets).\n  - Stronger attack methods should be used. The paper only reports performance under FGSM and PGD attacks, which are not strong enough. Stronger attacks such as CW and AutoAttack should be used.\n- There are some other works that investigate adversarial robustness in terms of distributionally robust optimization [1-2], the discussions of related works are mission. Furthermore, given the existence of these papers, I think this paper is not novel enough.\n- The theoretical analyses only show that the proposed framework is more general, but do not show why the more general framework behaves better. In general, a more specific framework may contain additional knowledge about the task and lead to better performance, so the fact that a more general framework leads to better performance is strange to me. I think it needs to be carefully explained.\n\n\n### references\n\n[1] Certifying Some Distributional Robustness with Principled Adversarial Training.\n\n[2] A Distributional Robustness Perspective on Adversarial Training with the $\\infty$-Wasserstein Distance."

Moreover, the conclusion obtained can be misleading. The golden standard is to use ImageNet as a must for the image datasets (probably the same is for the Malware detection dataset, I have just not worked with it)\n- when comparing the results shown in Tables 1 and 2, we can see that the best OT-regularized divergences methods in terms of accuracy are very different for image recognition and malware detection problem. What is the root cause behind it? No any written hypothesis or discussion. I guess (and see the item above) it is somehow related to MNIST dataset and that the results there are like 98-99% which makes all the improvement marginal and not very generalizable \n- starting the Page 2, the cost function $c(x,y)$ is introduced, but all the theorems and results are only valid if $c(x,y)$ is non-negative, but it is not mentioned in the main text of the paper (only in Appendix)"
