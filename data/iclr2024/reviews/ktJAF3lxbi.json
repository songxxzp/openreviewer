The core idea is to use past gradients in approximating the update term in diffusion ODEs. The parameters before past gradients are settled by minimizing MMSE to the fine-grained Euler approximation. The proposed IIA technique is only a sampling technique and does not require any modification of the pretrained model. Extensive experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of this technique."

However, as I'm not an expert in empirical diffusion models literature, the performance should be more carefully evaluated by other reviewers."

It is better to discuss why to choose such a parameter, probably with some numerical illustrations. In addition, only for BIIA-EDM $r=0$ is chosen, I wonder if it is because of bad performance. Choice of fine-grained timesteps $M$ is also not discussed.\n - Personally I think the IIA idea resembles that of \"Anderson Acceleration\" in optimization literature, but that's not referred in the paper. The authors may gain some insights from it.\n - The authors could illustrate more about the difference between BIIA and IIA. It seems IIA only decomposes the gradient form $0.5d_i+0.5d'_{i+1|i}$ into two terms, and treat the coefficients of such two terms as optimization parameters so as to add flexibility. I wonder how the performance of IIA is compared to BIIA with larger $r$, i.e., with more previous approximations included in MMSE optimization."
