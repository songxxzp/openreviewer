The paper proposes the Bellman backup of such successor measure, and proposes a recipe to estimate such successor measure using the proposed $\\delta$-model. Finally the paper evaluates the proposed method on some simple environments."

First, why is it necessary to redefine the occupancy measure/state(-action) distribution as successor representation or successor measure?\n\nSecond, why is it necessary to define the new \"random occupancy measure\", which is a distribution over distribution, but the inner distribution is just the Dirac distribution which is determined by the realization of the sample of the outer distribution? From my understanding, if one wants a distribution over the value function, suppose they have already have the occupancy measure, they could easily define the distribution of the value function (which is in $\\Delta(\\mathbb{R}^1)$) by projecting the occupancy measure to the reward vector. I think this is also indicated by prop. 1: to define the distributional return, one needs to take one expectation over the random occupancy measure. \n\nOverall, the theory results are rather limited. Most results seem like straight forward extension from the occupancy measure results to the random occupancy measure version. \n\n2. The significance of section 5.2 is unclear to me. How to tune MMD does not directly relate to the significance of the paper, and many description seems not significant (for example, the detailed description of the median trick).\n\n3. Since the theory contribution is rather limited, the experiment of the paper should be greatly improved. First, the paper should compare with other distribution RL methods, and the current benchmarks are also pretty easy."

Sp, $P(P(X))$ is a set of distributions over $[0,1]$. So, if I understand correctly, learning SDM is equivalent to estimating a distribution over  $[0,1]$. Even in this simple case, does the author's approach have any theoretical guarantee? (finite $m$ and equal weights look restrictive?)\n\n\n### Suggestion for presentation \n\n* Equation (4) may appear somewhat elementary to researcher within the RL community. The current phrasing, such as \"Blier et al. 2021 derived this equation...,\" seems inaccurate and should be revised. I believe that this equation had already gained widespread recognition prior to the work of Blier et al. (2021), as it is commonly featured in numerous standard RL texts and papers.\n\n* As a related point, I generally believe the author should not emphasize whether the definition pertains to discrete or continuous spaces to such an extent. The transformation from a discrete space (when a base measure is the counting measure) to a continuous space (when the base measure is a Lebsgue measure)  is typically straightforward for individuals with a basic understanding of probability. Therefore, in Section 3.2, the statement \"though this result is novel in the case of more general state spaces\" may be somewhat misleading. I suggest that this aspect should not be categorized as \"novel.\" Instead, I recommend that the author simply highlight the distinctions between the two contexts (SDM and standard distribution RL with rewards).\n\n* It is somewhat unclear which parameters are precisely optimized throughout the entire algorithm. As I understand it, the author optimizes parameters for all generative models simultaneously in equation (16). It would be beneficial to present the algorithm using an algorithmic environment for clarity."
