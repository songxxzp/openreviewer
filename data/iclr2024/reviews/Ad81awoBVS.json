This paper identifies RAI images and treats them differently from the original method. However, it is unclear whether the observed improvement stems from these RAI images alone. Assessing the performance of RAI images separately might lead to a more substantial improvement.\n\n4. The paper's structure could be improved. There is significant overlap in the information presented in Figures 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. It may be advisable to move figures like 4-7 to the supplementary section.\n\n5. The rationale behind the authors' decision to use the version of UniCon without soft aggregation and hierarchical augmentation remains unclear.

                "value": "This paper proposes a technique that can learn the rotation distribution of images within a dataset. The approach is motivated by the authors' study of one-class classification (OCC), which involves predicting whether data belongs to a particular class seen in training or is anomalous. Specifically, the authors are investigating the seeming strong linear relationship between rotation prediction accuracy and OCC. The authors attribute this to transformation bias, where samples that are semantic-preserving vs. semantic-shifting lead to different behavior when training OCC with contrastive learning approaches.\n\nTo this end, the authors propose a two-stage approach for learning the transformation distribution: 1) perform a standard contrastive self-supervised representation learning phase, and 2) transformation distribution estimation. For 2, the authors create a dataset consisting of the original samples in {0, 90, 180, and 270} degrees and learn a differentiable sampler with Gumbel Softmax to predict images that preserve semantics (i.e., rotating it does not necessarily change the orientation at which the picture must have been taken). Finally, MMD is used to perform density matching in the representation space to identify such semantic-preserving samples.\n\nThe authors use their model to 1) visually show a good model in learning RAIs vs. non-RAIs, 2) a correlation between the amount of RAIs in training and OCC performance, and 3) that using their approach consistently adds ~1% gain to OCC."

                "value": "The strengths of the paper include a clear motivation, strong analysis of the correlation between rotation prediction and OCC, and its unsupervised data-driven approach. The intuition to use a predictor in conjunction with the contrastive pretrained representations and density estimation to align the dataset makes sense for extracting out the transformation distribution exhibited within the training set. Understanding this distribution is an interesting task. The visual results of selecting RAI vs. non-RAI images are compelling. The issues with existing OCC approaches are well-analyzed and the the proposed approach provides modest but consistent improvement to existing OCC approaches."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "One weakness is that there is not a quantifiable way to measure the accuracy in RAI vs. non-RAI determination. One reason for this is that RAI images may be classified as 0, making it hard to separate these images from the truly non-RAI images. There is also not a discussion / inclusion of failure modes to understand where the model may succeed vs. fail. Another weakness is that the utility of the transformation distribution may be larger but is focused on OCC, and datasets used to evaluate OCC are from CIFAR-10, which may have different characteristics than some of the anomaly detection settings where labeled data of out-of-distribution samples could be limited. I also think it is odd that OCC is a common thread / motivator of the paper but the description of the technique for OCC is not in the approach section. The claim of the paper then is a bit broad, in some parts reading as if it is most concerned about OCC and other parts about the distribution being learned."

Do you have any examples / analysis of failure modes where images like those in figure 5 are mistakenly predicted to be RAI vs. non-RAI?\n\n3. Can you clarify the rule used in section 4.4 to determine if a sample is semantically-shifted? Which r is used?"

                "value": "- The method introduced detects rotations that remain unchanged and are semantically similar to original images, ensuring their exclusion as outliers. This method demonstrates sufficient generalizability for other transformation (ex., gaussian noise), as supported by section 4.3. I feel that this contribution is of sufficient interest to the research community.\n- The results on OCC presented in the paper outperform the baselines and can be added on top on existing methods. It emphasizes the significance of identifying the transformations present in the original dataset before incorporating them into the pretext task for learning."

The authors directly diverge to self-supervised learning methods for OCC. It fails to give complete picture of OCC for non-experts. I would suggest the authors to briefly also give an introduction to OCC and existing generative methods or point readers to more detailed survey paper [1].\n    - There exists a confusion regarding anomaly detection and OCC cited in related work, in which cases are they both considered the same?\n- Missing relevant citation: the authors seem to be missing an important citation on rotation estimation [2]. I would suggest the authors to include it for completeness of related work.\n\n[1] One-Class Classification: A Survey, arxiv 2021\n\n[2] Self-Supervised Representation Learning by Rotation Feature Decoupling, CVPR 2019"
