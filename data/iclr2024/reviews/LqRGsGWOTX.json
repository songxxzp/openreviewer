                "value": "1. The theoretical complexity result of the proposed algorithm, Theorem 1, lacks persuasiveness. Specifically, the choice of the iteration number $N$ in Algorithm 2 for lower-level variable updates is left unspecified. Furthermore, the selection of the parameter $I$ appears improper, particularly in comparison to the selection of the parameter $K$. This peculiarity arises because, according to Theorem 1, $I = O(1/\\epsilon^2)$, while $K = O(1/\\epsilon)$. Consequently, for sufficiently small values of $\\epsilon$, $I$ is significantly larger than $K$. However, both the implementation of the proposed algorithm and the theoretical analysis, as exemplified by Lemma 2, necessitate $I$ to be smaller than $K$.\n\n2. Despite the authors' assertion that they do not require the boundedness of the norm of the gradient of the upper-level objective function, $ || \\nabla_y f(x, y) ||$, as stipulated in Assumption 2 (i), it is worth noting that they still demand the boundedness of $|| \\nabla_y f(x, y^*(x)) ||$. The rationale behind the relative ease of achieving this condition in practical scenarios, as opposed to the former requirement, remains unclear. Moreover, it remains unaddressed whether the problems examined in the numerical experiments exhibit unbounded smoothness yet satisfy Assumption 2 (i).\n\n3. The selection of the parameters $I$ and $N$ in the implementation of the proposed algorithm in the numerical experiments deviates from the parameters required by the theoretical analysis. Specifically, the theoretical analysis mandates that both $I$ and $N$ should be large as $\\epsilon$ becomes small. However, in the context of the numerical experiments, the authors have set the values for $I$ and $N$ as merely 2 or 3, which contradicts the theoretical analysis."

                "value": "The authors present a novel algorithm for bilevel optimization called BO-REP. This method achieves $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^4)$ convergence rates to find $\\epsilon$-stationary point in the stochastic non-convex setup assuming only a relaxed smoothness assumption. Moreover, this result matches the state-of-the-art complexity results under the more restrictive types of smoothness up to logarithmic factors. The key two technical ingredients - initialization refinement and periodic updates - are easily implementable. Finally, authors demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed approach on hyper-representation learning, hyperparameter optimization and data hyper-clearning for text classification."
