From my view, it is more like attribute editing rather than object removal.

It is mentioned in the introductory sections but not later on.\n\nThe knowledge analysis provides significant insight into multi-modal models, showing they seem to store knowledge differently from language-only models. \n\nKnowledge localization analysis is used effectively to enable highly efficient control and editing of the image generation process, through direct model parameter adjustment without any model training. This seems to be a unique advantage of this approach that is reminiscent of manipulating eigenvectors to generate a range of plausible face images (pre-deep learning).\n\nIt seems that the relative importance of each model component is calculated by corrupting it with gaussian noise; generating an image from the corrupted model; then using CLIP-Score to measure the difference between the image and its caption. A low score indicates incompatibility, and implies that the model component is important relative to the caption. This process is linear in the number of model components being tested, and therefore does not scale well to fine-grained components such as individual neurons.\n\nDiff-QuickFix is a clever way to edit generated images, by directly optimizing the weight matrix of a single layer in the text-encoder rather than standard model updating. It is much faster, and appears to be quite effective based on the provided qualitative results.\nThe experimental design seems sound, comparing against two recent editing methods on the same prompt dataset they used previously, via the CLIP-score metric. The results show that the method achieves equivalent editing performance to the baselines, with a huge gain in computational efficiency."

In computer vison, an attribute is usually a property of an object such as its color, texture, gender (for a person), presence of accessories (eyeglasses, hats, etc.), age, and so on. It seems that visual attribute here means any sort of visual information, which is confusing.\n\nFig. 2, which is very effective and interesting, shows that there is a large overlap between model components that are causal for the four different attributes. There are a few components (Unet layers) that are unique to different attributes, but most seem to be causal for all attributes, which is problematic. Not only is information distributed widely across the layers for all attributes, but it is largely the same layers that seem to be encoding most information. This is not a weakness of the causal tracing approach per se, but it does call into question the proposed editing method. How effective could it be, when very few model components independently control different attributes?\n\nFig. 3 seems highly unlikely and may call the approach into question, as the illustrated result strongly implies that only one layer and one token in that layer encodes relevant knowledge. This seems highly unlikely. Is there some way to corroborate this result?\n\nMost of the references lack information on the venues in which the works were published.

Specifically both the UNet and text encoder are studied, and experiments show the inspected visual concepts and attributes are scattered on various layers of UNet, as well as the first transformer layer of the CLIP text encoder.\n\nBased on the findings above, authors propose to remove/update concepts by modifying the out put projection unit in the first self attention layer to remap the generated activation to target concept's activation, thus removing/updating the model's generated content."
