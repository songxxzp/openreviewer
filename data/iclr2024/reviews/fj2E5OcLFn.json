While the naive computation scales cubically in the number of observations, the authors propose a iterative solver with linear cost per iteration. The idea behind this solver is that the expensive quantity in the GP posterior (kernel matrix inverse) can be thought of as a minimiser of a particular regression problem, which can be solved iteratively with gradient-based methods. The authors consider two formulations of such a regression problem (primal and dual), study their convergence properties, as well as discuss randomised gradients computations to achieve linear computational cost. The proposed algorithm is shown to perform competitively on a number of benchmarks."

Why do you think it is the case?\n\n- The GP hyper-parameters (e.g. observational noise variance, kernel parameters, etc.) are typically estimated by maximising the marginal log-likelihood using gradient-based methods.

However, it would be good if rigorous theoretical guarantees could be proved, at least for some special cases. Besides, I think the authors stress too much on the algorithm details, which can be deferred to the appendix for a major part of them while trying to leave some room for theoretical analysis.\n* There are many different optimizers for the kernel ridge regression, such as AdaGrad, Adam, etc. The authors should also try these methods in the experiments.\n* The algorithm design is a bit incremental to me, as it looks like a combination of standard existing approaches, which is tuned for the specific tasks. Then, the idea of the algorithm design may be difficult to extend to other tasks.\n* Besides, it is not clear to me whether the variance of stochastic gradient is really a big issue from Figure 2, as the authors do not add the full-gradient version for comparison. If controlling the variance is important, the authors may also need to consider variance-reduce techniques (e.g., SVRG) and add them to the experiments."
