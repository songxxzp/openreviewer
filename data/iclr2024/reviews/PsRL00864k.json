One key idea of the paper is that there should be a semantic token corrector before generating the target audio as there will be some pronunciations in the non-native source audio. The system performs semantic token correction on the HuBERT units and utilizes TFCodec as input to an auto-regressive decoder to generate the target audio. \nExperiments suggest that with a smaller model and faster decoding, the proposed model can achieve higher quality outputs as compared to VALL-E-AC approach. The quality is measured in terms of speech naturalness, speaker similarity, and accentedness."

Accent Conversion is an existed task, and the author try to address two challenges including: 1) training with less parallel data, 2) removal of accent effects on prosody and pronunciation patterns. Although pre-training with large unlabeled data and finetuning with a few parallel data is not a creative idea (e.g., Spear-TTS), the paper does effectively solve the two problems, and the authors have comprehensively analyzed and verified the relationship between accent, semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. Besides, introducing TF-Codec instead of Encodec/SoundStream shows the improvement in reducing the complexity and latency, which is helpful for speech generation.\n\n- quality: The quality of the paper is high, with clear problem definition, adequate literature review, comprehensive analysis and well-organized presentation.\n\n- clarity: The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. \n\n- significance: The significance of the paper is that it provides a novel method for accent conversion that can be used with a small amount of parallel data. The similar idea of decomposing accent conversion into semantic token generation and acoustic token generation has been attractive recently, which can be inspiring for other works in the field of speech generation.\n\nOverall, the paper is a relatively valuable contribution to the field of accent conversion and speech generation."
