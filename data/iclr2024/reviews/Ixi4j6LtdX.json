The motivation is to tune both teacher and student models in a collaborative way. The proposed method consists of 4 steps, teacher fine-tuning, student distillation, meta-teacher learning, and student curriculum learning. The method is compared with the state-of-the-art baselines on SuperGLUE tasks and shows advantages. In several reported results, the teacher model outperforms the original teacher models, and the student model also outperforms the original teacher models. Finally, several discussions are presented with experiments."

In that sense, it is not so surprising that the student model outperforms the teacher and that the improvements margins are high enough \u2014 this should probably be made a bit more explicit by the authors.

Besides the efficiency advantages, I wonder whether it is more effective to directly use the parameter-efficient fine-tuning.\n* The curriculum learning has been widely studied in the literature of KD and I wonder whether it is necessary to include it in the meta-learning-based KD.
