                "value": "The authors present, Cleanba, a new platform for distributed DRL that addresses reproducibility issues under different hardware settings. One of the biggest challenges in applying deep reinforcement learning to real world problems is reproducibility. In general, the algorithms are not robust to implementation details which are often crucial for successful real-world applications. The authors introduce a new distributed architecture that is reproducible if random seeds are controlled and leverages interleaving the actor and learner\u2019s computations. The main contribution of the paper is that the authors propose a new mechanism to synchronize the actor and learner which reduces the non-determinism and improves reproducibility. While the synchronization mechanism is simple, the experiments show that Cleanba\u2019s variants can obtain equivalent or higher scores than moolib\u2019s IMPALA, but with 1) less training wall time under the 8 GPU setting and 2) more reproducible learning curves in different hardware settings."

Therefore despite the simplicity of the proposed mechanism, I believe that the performance improvement is significant. \n\nQuality & Clarity. The authors describe the current state-of-the-art and its pitfalls clearly using clear code samples. They provide empirical results to further their hypothesis on what contribute to the current reproducibility issues in popular distributed reinforcement learning architectures. The experiments are extensive in comparing the proposed architecture to other benchmarks in the literature."

The authors propose to mechanisms to overcome the reproducibility issues in distributed reinforcement learning: 1) de-coupling hyper-parameters, 2) a new synchronization mechanism to better align actors and learners. The de-coupling mechanism is not novel and already exists in prior literature. The synchronization mechanism is simple yet novel. The performance of the new approach is tested only in Atari which is not a real-world problem where reproducibility is a key challenge. The paper can greatly benefit from a real-world application.\n\n\nQuality & Clarity. The language is a bit off in several sections, specifically in the first paragraph, which makes it difficult to read at times. There are several grammatical errors as well."

It will be better to talk about the contributions first even when they may be simple yet have far reaching implications to reduce training time and improve reproducibility at scale.\n\nIt is important to consider a real-world example when reproducibility is one of the main challenges. Atari is a great way to benchmark but does not present all the variability such as in robotics applications for example to truly highlight issues related to the reproducibility.\n\nIn Section 5.1, the authors state that Cleanba\u2019s IMPALA is 6.8x faster than monobeast\u2019s IMPALA, mostly because Cleanba actors\nrun on GPUs, whereas monobeast\u2019s actors run on CPUs. I think the performance metrics should be based on the same compute hardware CPU only or GPU only."

If there was a different environment just highlighting that this 1 second lag has a meaningful detriment to final performance that could be really compelling.\n- Although IMPALA is a common algorithm, devoting a short paragraph to it in the background could be helpful (since although many are familiar with it, not as many are with the intricacies as it relates to distributed computing that get mentioned in the next section)\n- In Figure 5, the y axis could have their tickers removed. The absolute numeric scales are not particularly meaningful (I suspect even the most experienced RL researcher will not know if a score of 200,000 on UpNDown is good) and add a lot of clutter to the figure\n- The majority of Fig 1 is highlighted. Maybe it\u2019s better to just highlight the part that is the same? Or remove the highlighting? It just doesn\u2019t add much when the points you want to draw attention to are basically the whole code block.\n- In figure 3, the optimality gap x tickers are overlapping\n- Moolib is a good point of comparison, but I see that this repo is now archived. Are there other DDRL libraries worth comparing to that are more actively maintained?\n- One concern I have is that this paper tries too hard to be an algorithm paper. It presents cleanba, which is a software package that the authors want people to use, but not a lot of time is dedicated to that. More time is dedicated to the analysis of results from cleanba. While these results are somewhat interesting, I think they could be consolidated more (e.g. move the individual atari games to the appendix, and just present HNS, just an idea). Then use that space to actually describe the package of cleanba more (e.g. how does a user interact with it? Extend it? UML diagram perhaps? Etc.). The paper is called \u201ccleanba\u201d for the package, but I can\u2019t say I really know programmatically much about cleanba after reading the paper."
