                "value": "This work addresses the issue of non-identifiability in causal representation learning models using object-centric approaches. The authors show that using sparse transitions between pairs of images and models that exploit such regularities can allow to solve the responsibility problem when attempting to invert a data-generation process in the image domain. Specifically, the exploit the fact that object centric models partition images into objects to reduce the number of interventions needed in order to identify the properties that correspond to each object thus allowing them to be identified. To encourage identifiability the authors introduce a penalty that seeks to keep all slots in the object-centric representation constant for both images, which can them only vary for the object that was perturbed. The authors then show that this leads to an increase in the ability of downstream models to predict the different properties of the objects in a scene."

If I understand correctly, the method is essentially nothing but adding a slot matching step to the existing weak-supervised disentangled representation learning.\n- Positioning: The claim of being the first to `achieve disentangled representations in environments with multiple interchangeable objects` is overstated. Similar objectives have been pursued in recent studies, e.g., Block-Slot Representation [1]. Slot matching has also been considered in recent work [2]. A more thorough positioning in the literature about multi-object scenes might be needed.\n- Theory: the proof sketch for Proposition 2 appears less than compelling in its current form. Part of my doubt is attributed to the use of identical objects. It would strengthen the paper if the author could prove Proposition 2 in more common scenarios.\n\n[1] Neural Systematic Binder, ICLR'23\n[2] Causal Triplet, CLeaR'23"

How does it perform compared to a simple initialization trick (e.g, using the slot of the 1st image to initialize that of the 2nd)?\n- Could the authors provide a more detailed explanation on `simply add a projection head, that is trained by a latent space loss`? Why is the projection head needed on top of the object-centric encoder?"
