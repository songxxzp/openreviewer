The example in Figure 1 and the illustrated examples in Section 3 nicely help the understanding of the proposed idea. The propositions and theorems are well organized and clearly demonstrated. \n\n2. The proposed idea of orbit-equivariance is novel and valuable. It allows permutation equivariance between the nodes in different orbits, but breaks the equivariance for the nodes in the same orbit. In this way, while it allows the distinct output of the symmetric nodes in the same orbit, the hierarchy of the graph structure is still represented in an invariant way, which means the multiset of outputs associated with each distinct graph orbit is unchanged. More succinctly, an orbit-equivariant GNN now becomes a set function of orbits other than individual nodes.\n\n3. The design of Orbit-Indiv-GNNs and m-Orbit-Transform-GNNs is meaningful and fulfill the theoretical guarantee derived by Theorem 2. \n\n4. The experiments, although not as impressive as the methodology part, are still sufficient to support the benefit of the proposed orbit-equivariance and the developed models."

It seems there are many freedoms to derive an orbit-equivariant GNN that has max-orbit no more than m. It is unclear why the authors choose the one proposed in the paper. And the experiments on Bioisostere show that the performance of 2-Orbit-Transform-GNN is worse than Orbit-Indiv-GNNs. Does it mean the proposed construction of m-Orbit-Transform-GNN requires further exploration?\n\n2. Another concern is that the processes in both Orbit-Indiv-GNN and m-Orbit-Transform-GNN to make them orbit-equivariant are not differential. I would like to hear form the authors\u2019 thinking about if it is possible to derive a learnable equivariance-to-orbit-equivariant layer other the ad-hoc transformations proposed by the authors. Will the learnable ones further improve the performance? \n\n3.
