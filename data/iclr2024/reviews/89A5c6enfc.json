In this approach, edge weights are defined based on the noisy labels in the graph, giving higher weight to nodes with the same noisy label and lower weight to nodes with different labels. Using this weighted graph, the authors apply a graph diffusion local clustering method called 'flow diffusion' to determine the clustering. The paper includes both theoretical proofs and empirical evidence, demonstrating why this approach improves clustering accuracy compared to applying the flow diffusion method directly to the original graph."

                "value": "- Regarding the discussions following Theorem 3.4:\n  \n  - The statement that \"as $\\gamma$ becomes lager, it generally becomes more\n    difficult to accurately recover K [the cluster]\" appears counterintuitive. Given that $\\gamma\\coloneqq \\frac{p(k-1)}{q(n-k)}$ signifies the ratio of internal to external connections within a cluster, an increase in $\\gamma$ implies more internal connections. This suggests a stronger, more cohesive cluster. Could you elaborate on why higher $\\gamma$ values lead to increased difficulty in cluster recovery?\n  \n  - The assertion that \"F1 is lower bounded by a constant as long as $\\gamma$ is a constant\" raises questions.  What does \"$\\gamma$ is constant\" mean in this context? As far as I understand, the value $\\gamma$ is defined for each node and implicitly depends exclusively on the cluster size, $k$, and the edge probabilities, $p$ and $q$. I suggest that this dependence is stress further, since as it is written now, $\\gamma$ is apparently a constant by itself. Consequently, I guess that \"$\\gamma$ constant\" means that it has the same value for all nodes (or for all clusters). Nonetheless, the lower bound of F1 would still depend on $a_0$ and $a_1$. Could you clarify why the lower bound of F1 is described as a constant despite potential dependencies on other parameters?\n  \n  - The statement, \"even when the initial labels are deemed fairly accurate based on $a_0$ and $a_1$, e.g. $a_1$ = 1, $a_0$ = 0.99, the F1 score of the labels can still be very low.\" Could you explain the factors contributing to the low F1 score in this scenario?\n\n- How robust is the proposed method concerning the source mass of the seed ($\\Delta_s$)?"

The main theorem requires $p = \\omega(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\log k}}{\\sqrt{k}})$ which produces a dense cluster. Can this condition be relaxed to include less dense clusters?\n3. Is there an information-theoretic limit on recovering local graph cluster with noisy labels such that the sharpness of the lower bound on F1 can be evaluated?\n4. It would be helpful to compare the current result with these on local graph clustering without labels. In particular, when the labels do not provided any information ($a_0 = a_1 = 1/2$), does the proposed algorithm have improvements over the previous ones?\n5. Weighted message passing is another localized algorithm applied to SBM with noisy label information (see [1] and references therein). How does the flow diffusion algorithm and theoretical result compare to it?\n\n[1] Cai, T. T., Liang, T., & Rakhlin, A. (2020).

However, the setting of their experiments does not reflect this point, i.e., they only use the predicted labels as the noisy labels. I did not see any other available sources to transform into noisy labels. If the setting is local graph clustering with noisy node labels, the authors should compare the proposed method with other existing methods that focus on this setting, i.e., node labels should be contained in the compared methods. So the experiments have limitations. I hope the authors clarify the setting and make more comparisons with existing methods. Experiments should be enriched to verify the effectiveness of the method.\n- The paper lacks complexity analysis.\n- The comparison of the empirical running time of each method should be contained.
