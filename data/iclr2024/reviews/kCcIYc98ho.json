                "value": "This paper investigates a critical issue within existing PbRL techniques, particularly focusing on the potential adverse effects stemming from corrupted preferences provided by non-expert human labelers. To address this problem, the authors propose a novel approach called Mixing Corrupted Preferences (MCP). This method involves applying a Mixup technique to augment the data, enhancing the model's robustness against faulty instances and improving feedback efficiency, even when working with limited data. The effectiveness of this method is evaluated against state-of-the-art techniques in a standard PbRL benchmark. The results demonstrate that the proposed MCP method outperforms PEBBLE in terms of both robustness and feedback efficiency, while also effectively complementing SURF. A key contribution of this work lies in introducing the Mixup technique into the PbRL framework, thereby bolstering its robustness and feedback efficiency, particularly when dealing with corrupted preference data."

This issue is relatively underexplored but holds great significance within the PbRL framework. I appreciate the authors for dedicating their efforts to address this crucial topic.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of the proposed method is elegantly straightforward. It requires only data processing and doesn't necessitate the introduction of complex learning algorithms. This simplicity renders it easily implementable and adaptable to nearly all existing state-of-the-art methods within the conventional PbRL frameworks. In terms of presentation, I feel the paper is well-organized and easy to read."

Although the authors briefly mentioned the limitations in the future work section, I believe a more comprehensive discussion of the implications of this assumption is necessary. For the experimental design, I think it could benefit from a more thorough comparison with state-of-the-art PbRL methods, particularly SURF, which also employs data augmentation for PbRL. Additionally, it may be pertinent to consider the paper on RL from diverse humans [1] as a closely related work that approaches the issue of corrupted human preferences as well in a distinct manner. This comparison would be crucial for evaluating the robustness in handling corrupted preferences. However, the authors may not be aware of this work, and they are not the first to address the issue of corrupted preferences. Furthermore, I recommend introducing the Mixup techniques in the preliminary section to enhance the paper's flow. Finally, while I acknowledge the challenges in conducting real human experiments for PbRL in complex control tasks, this work could be further strengthened with user studies conducted with a diverse group of non-expert human labelers.\n\n[1] Xue, W., An, B., Yan, S., & Xu, Z.

Unfortunately, I did not have time to thoroughly discuss this addition with the authors and some concerns remain (such as the lack of quantitative differences, or the fact that preferences are collected just from the unsupervised trajectory preferences). It is worth pointing out (as the authors did in the rebuttal) that neither SURF, RUNE, MRN, nor B-Pref (many of which were published on this venue) included actual human-in-the-loop experiments.\n\nFor _W2_, the authors removed the requirement for convex state and actions. It remains conceivable that the reward is trained with unfeasible trajectories, but this does not seem to negatively affect the performance of MCP."

Is it based on uncertainty like in PEBBLE? Does the initial selection affect performance of MCP?\n* _Q4_: The authors do not provide any intuition about the role of the beta distribution. Could you explain how you arrived to the values used in the experiments?\n\n**Nitpicks and suggestions (will not affect rating)**\n\n* Please use vector graphics for figures, they are currently very blurry when zoomed in.\n* Figure 1's caption needs to be expanded upon. I would also use the extra space could also be used to indicate that the trajectories and the labels are used for reward-learning.\n* The description of the plots in Section 4 (page 5), is far away from the actual plots.\n* Could you add final performance tables for all the experiments. Sometimes it is hard to see which of the methods does better and by how much.\n* For figure 4, could you use a boxplot or a violin plot? It would be interesting to see if there are any spearman correlation outliers in each of the tasks and algorithms.\n* In the Related Work section, I suggest changing \"discovered\" to \"investigated\", to avoid a debate whether algorithms are discovered or invented.\n* In the Related work section, I would incorporate the use of mixup in representation learning and computer vision.\n* The limitations of the method are currently stated as future work. I suggest to write them as limitations, since it is clearer to the readers.\n\n\n**[[Post-rebuttal update]]**\n\nAll questions were addressed in the rebuttal.

Mixed-up values in each dimension could lie in *valid* state and action space because their value would lie between the min and max value of spaces, but as a whole, it's very unlikely that the state and action would be valid state and actions. For instance, linear combination of two proprioceptive states of 7-dof arm is very likely to lead to physically infeasible joint positions, and there's no guarantee that it'll be meaningfully connected to linear combination of labels. Without thorough investigation and support in this point, it's very difficult to justify the usage of method in many cases.\n- Also the main weakness is that a lot of experimental results are not statistically significant, and the improvements over PEBBLE and SURF are very weak. At least the number of seed should be significantly increased and also other metrics from [rliable](https://github.com/google-research/rliable) could be considered."
