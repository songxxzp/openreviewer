                "value": "While this paper presents a seemingly promising approach to long context modeling, its major issue lies in the lack of clarity regarding its use case. According to the paper's description, HOMER first breaks down a long context (e.g., 64k) into N chunks, prunes tokens from each chunk, and finally merges them into a compressed and short context. If this is the case, this method is not suitable for streaming decoding scenarios (where the key-value cache of previously decoded tokens is not recalculated, only new decode tokens are computed).\n\nThe key question arises: if this work is not for streaming decoding, then there is no need for such a process. For a 64k length context, wouldn't it be sufficient to ignore the first 62k context and only use the last 2k context? According to the results in Figure 1 of the paper, using only 2k context, the perplexity (PPL) is less than 6 (around 5 point something), whereas after all the effort of merging with HOMER, the PPL is above 8.\n\nGiven this, I question the necessity of using HOMER. Using the last 2K context directly seems to yield better results, casting a large doubt on the value of the method proposed in this paper. If the setting of this paper is not for streaming decoding, then the performance of HOMER should at least be better than the PPL of the 2K context. However, this method requires recalculating the key-value pairs for the previous context, which doesn't seem to align with a streaming decoding setting, making it the most confusing aspect for me."

Instead, memory is the major focus. While memory footprint is an important dimension, inference time is very important for LLM applications. Given the extensive manipulations of HOMER on context embeddings at each Transformer layer, I expect a significant overhead occurring due to such forward operations compared to RoPE methods.\n2. The explanation of propagative refinement is confusing: token pruning is done through a forward pass, and the top-K token embeddings are tracked and obtained only at the top-layer after the entire forward pass. It is unclear to me how the refined embeddings are gathered at the low-level layers, and impact the computation results shown in the ablation in Table 4(b).\n3. Minor point: the token pruning section didn\u2019t explain how it is done \u2013 it is unclear how the top-K hyperparameter is selected, and the tradeoff between speed and K is made (e.g. keeping a large K at each layer will result in more steps of pruning)."
