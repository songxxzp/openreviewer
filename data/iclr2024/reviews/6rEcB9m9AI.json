                "value": "The paper addresses the challenge of poor generalization performance in adaptive gradient methods like Adam, hypothesizing that adding an exploration strategy with additional memory of gradient information could improve performance. Building on previous work, which used a memory buffer for storing \"critical gradients,\" the authors propose a new memory-augmented Adam optimizer that stores \"critical momenta\" (CM). This new approach aims to prevent gradient cancellation and allows the optimizer to escape sharp minima and converge to flat regions which are more likely to generalize. The authors validate their approach through convergence analysis and empirical benchmarks, showing improvements in model performance in both supervised and online learning settings."

The paper does not sufficiently discuss the computational overhead introduced by the memory component, which is critical for practical deployments, especially in resource-constrained environments. \n\nThe experimental results indicate some improvements, but these could potentially be attributed to the additional use of memory and hyperparameters. It would be beneficial for the paper to discuss whether Adam+CM offers any regret guarantees or optimality conditions given the added computational complexity i.e. could there be another algorithm that does better? \n\nOne potential alternative baseline that comes to mind is to consider averaging the weights via approaches such as Polyak averaging or Stochastic Weight Averaging. These methods have been shown to improve generalization performance and only require one additional copy of the parameters if one employs the exponential moving average trick. The paper could be strengthened by comparing Adam+CM to these alternatives--perhaps the two approaches are orthogonal."

(2020)) or measures of how quickly loss changes in a local neighborhood. The interaction between sharpness, distance travelled, and generalization performance seems quite complicated generally as it is also a function of the learning rate and other hyperparameters. This should be made clear in Figure 7 and Figure 8.\n- In general, as mentioned in weaknesses, I would be interested in a more thorough study on how additional memory can best be used. It seems like C is generally set to 5 in the grid search -- can we get away with smaller $C$? What if we used a different value for CG and CM?"

For example, EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet should achieve a top-1 validation accuracy of 76.3% [https://paperswithcode.com/paper/efficientnet-rethinking-model-scaling-for], but the results reported in the paper range between 65.4-71.7%. Also, Adam+SAM is performing very poorly for this specific case, and is significantly worse than the original Adam, but no explanation is given for this poor performance.\n\nIt would seem like the current experiments would be strongly affected by the batch size, but the batch size is not included in their hyperparameter search."

Is there any explanation as to why Adam+CM behaves this way when it is supposed to explore flatter regions compared to other optimizers?\n\nWhy is Adam+SAM performing so poorly for EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet in Table 2?\n\nComments\nThe correspondence between the two plots in Figure 4 would be more obvious if the color of the lines were matched."

Indeed, the training loss of a flat minimum is usually higher than that of a sharp minimum on real-world datasets.\n3. The proposed method is partly motivated by the performance gap between SGD and Adam, but is not compared to SGD in the experiments. Moreover, it would be interesting to see if critical momenta improve the performance of SGD as well.\n4. The baselines are not particularly strong, and it is a bit strange that Adam+SAM performs almost the same or even worse than vanilla Adam on image classification tasks.\n5.
