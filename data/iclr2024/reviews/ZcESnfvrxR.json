Then, CASR, a video action segmentation enhancer based on causal abstraction that can be used with different baseline models, is introduced. The effectiveness and generalization performance of the method are validated on three different datasets."

For the content in Weakness 2, I listed the following questions.\n- First, I think the authors need to describe the experimental setup of Tables 2 and 3 more clearly. The experiments covered in Tables 2 and 3 should include the following key information: first, make it clear on which dataset the experiments were conducted; second, make it clear which model was chosen in Table 3. These details are important for the reader to understand the context of the experiment and the plausibility of the results.\n- Second, concerning the combination of batch size and sub-batch size (512,128) in Table 3, while this can improve the efficiency of whitening and constructing the causal adjacency matrix, it remains unclear why enhancing the efficiency of these two would have an impact on the segmentation performance of the model. I expect the authors to provide a more detailed explanation to help readers better understand this correlation.\n- Third, I think the performance improvement of the four selected baseline models is not enough to reflect the generalization and robustness of the proposed method. The authors should provide more robust experimental data and may consider separate experimental validation of the TCN-based (e.g., MS-TCN++, ETSN, ASRF), Transformer-based (e.g., AsFormer, CETNet, LTContext) and Diffusion-based (e.g., DiffAct) methods respectively."

It retains cross-segment relationships while discarding inter-segment ones, which satisfies a consistent mapping of causal abstraction in terms of action semantics from frames to segments. Besides, contrastive learning is used to identify whether each frame belongs to the corresponding segment. In addition, a new evaluation metric, Causal Edit Distance (CED) is proposed to evaluate the causal explanation ability of segmentation results. The experimental results show that the proposed method can boost the performance of various SOTA action segmentation models."
