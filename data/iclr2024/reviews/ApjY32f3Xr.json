                "value": "The article introduces \"PINNacle\", a robust benchmark suite tailored for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This suite boasts a rich assortment of over 20 intricate PDE challenges, complemented by a user-centric toolbox that houses over 10 of the latest PINN techniques. These techniques are segmented by the authors into categories: loss reweighting, advanced optimizers, unique loss functions, and groundbreaking architectures. An exhaustive analysis is then executed with this benchmark dataset to scrutinize these variations.\n\nMany of the challenges pinpointed in the dataset resonate with a multitude of real-world scenarios. Thus, the efficacy of a method in tackling these challenges becomes a credible measure of its real-world utility. To generate the data, the authors employ the FEM solver from COMSOL 6.0 for intricately geometric problems and the spectral method from Chebfun for the more chaotic issues. This dataset encompasses challenges like the heat equation, Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, Navier-Stokes equation, among others.\n\nThe paper outlines a uniform criteria to gauge the performance of varied PINN techniques across all challenges, promoting a methodical comparison of different tactics. Performance assessment is conducted using various metrics, such as accuracy, convergence rate, and computational prowess. Moreover, the authors shed light on the advantages and limitations of these methods, providing direction for subsequent studies, especially in fields like domain decomposition and loss reweighting.\n\nIn essence, the article's merits lie in its crafting of a dataset that mirrors significant challenges confronted by PINNs, establishing a uniform assessment criteria for different PINN approaches, and giving valuable insights on the strengths and pitfalls of these methods. This work undeniably propels the growth of PINNs, igniting further creativity and advancements in this burgeoning domain."

Given that PINNs seem to be mostly providing different function spaces for PDE solutions, one original base PINN should be included in the benchmark, which is to give each hat function on a finite element mesh one parameter, and hence include finite element methods. Because some of the data sets were created using FEM, the original mesh would yield 0 error, but different meshes may not, and in particular coarser meshes would accumulate error. Analyzing a curve of remeshing from same resolution to coarse would provide a baseline for the performances of the other PINNs.\n\n- In the above sense, it also becomes important to quantify flop counts. It appears that most PINNs need to be fitted for each PDE solution, incurring the typically high flop count of solving an optimization problem (compared to one forward pass), and only some of them can learn solutions conditional on hyperparameters given as input and require only forward passes to solve e.g. from different inital conditions.\nFor all cases, there should be 3 different flop counts provided: 1) The number of flops required to create the training set 2) The number of flops required for any general training of the method  3) the number of flops required to evaluate/fit the method on a particular example. Many PINNs, and the FEM baseline would only have nonzero counts in point 3, and it would be good to compare them.\nHaving flop counts or even wall time counts would allow answering questions like \"at equal error rate, does fitting a PINN or fitting FEM cost more computational power?\" and \"At equal computing power, can FEM beat the error rates of the listed PINNs?\"\n\n- continuing the discussion about flop counts, methods learning from multiple data sets/examples should be included in order to compare flop counts and provide additional reference error values. In particular for the time propagating PDEs, solutions using U-nets or FNOs from e.g. PDE bench should be included as reference values, in terms of performance, flops required for training, flops required to generate the required training data, and flops required to run a forward pass to obtain a solution. Then one can assess how many PINNs or FEM solutions one can compute for the same budget as a certain number of forward passes of the propagator network. The should be a break-even point at some number of forward passes justifying the training effort.\n\nWithout these points, the benchmark is unfortunately sitting just beyond actual widespread utility. I would highly encourage the authors to add these baselines to make the benchmark useful. Despite my positive bias towards benchmarking efforts I cannot recommend acceptance of this paper in its current state."
