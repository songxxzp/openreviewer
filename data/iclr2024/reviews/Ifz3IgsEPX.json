                "value": "The proposed method is highlighted for its efficiency, especially for black-box models. The method does not rely on gradients but only on the forward pass, which is likened to zeroth-order gradients. This approach makes the method more memory-efficient compared to any gradient-based method, including soft prompt tuning.\n-\tThe method emphasizes the memory efficiency of the method in both training and inference. During training, since only inference is performed, the complexity depends solely on the context length. The paper mentions the use of k demonstrations in meta-prompts, which has a complexity similar to k-shot in-context learning. For inference, the generated prompts are short, resulting in low memory overhead.\n-\tThe main computational bottleneck is identified as the ensemble. However, the method performs ensemble prediction per token, which has a complexity similar to inference. The potential for parallelizing the process is mentioned, suggesting that this could further speed up the training.\n\nIt is further novel and a bit surprising to see the \u201cpositive transfer\u201d DLN prompts can work on larger models than on the source models, because it challenges the traditional assumption that prompts generated by a smaller model would only work well on similar or smaller models. This finding suggests that the prompts generated by DLN can be used to improve the performance of larger models, which can be beneficial in real-world applications. It might potentially open new possibilities for progressively improving the performance of newer large language models using prompts generated by smaller \u201cold\u201d models.\n\nThe paper compares the proposed method with existing methods, such as DLN-1, highlighting the advantages of the proposed method. The paper also provides insights into the potential limitations of other methods, such as Vicuna-7b's struggles with certain datasets."

                "value": "**Motivation:** The paper solves a very important yet larger overlooked problem, i.e., the two-fold concerns surrounding data privacy when adapting LLMs on sensitive data\n-\tData Confidentiality: Certain data, like medical histories, proprietary system logs, and personal messages, are inherently confidential and should not be transmitted beyond local devices, internal computing systems, and mobile phones.\n-\t Information Leakage: Resources derived from private data might inadvertently contain personally identifiable information. Even with a limited parameter set, such as prompts, the potential for data breaches remains significant.\n\n**Method:** DP-OPT operates exclusively on the client device and uses demonstrations to guide a local LLM to generate prompts. The local assistant model may be significantly smaller than the intended cloud-based LLMs. DP-OPT uses differential privacy to protect the privacy of the data while optimizing the prompt. It also allows for the transfer of prompts suggested by LLMs without compromising performance. DP-OPT is the first end-to-end framework where the entire prompt process is managed on the local device and offers services via an API, thus ensuring data confidentiality, information privacy, and cloud model ownership and IP. \n\nPrior work shows that prompts suggested by LLMs can be transferred without compromising performance. The paper shows that DLN prompts can transfer to and work better on larger models than on the source models, which is called positive transfer. DP-OPT allows for the transfer of prompts suggested by LLMs without compromising performance. The authors also provide the first solution to ensure the privacy of the gradient-free algorithms that demonstrate strong empirical performance compared to in-context learning and previous private gradient-based competitors.\n\n**Experiments:** The authors conducted experiments on four different tasks, including sentiment analysis, question type classification, sentiment analysis on news articles, and disaster relevance classification. They compared the performance of DP-OPT with other state-of-the-art methods, including PEZ and GPT-3, and showed that DP-OPT outperforms them in terms of accuracy and privacy. Impressively, DPOPT generates privacy-preserving prompts by Vicuna-7b, that can yield competitive performance compared to non-private in-context learning on GPT3.5 or local private prompt tuning."

Why this comparison is valid/fair?\n\nIn Figure 4, the provided examples seems to suggested that the method won\u2019t vary the task description while only generating few-shot prompts?\n\nOverall, I appreciate the contribution of this paper.

In addition, please provide more description and real-world cases of the consequences of a privacy leakage from the prompt (e.g., how much information can be breached).\n\n- Lack of evaluation on privacy leakage \n\nConsidering that one of the key motivations of the study is to address the threats related to \"data confidentiality\" and \"information leakage\", it would be expected that an evaluation on the privacy performance of the proposed approach is conducted. There are only several examples of prompts provided, rather than evaluate the privacy protection in a quantitative manner. It would be necessary to involve some privacy metrics in the evaluation. It would be even better if some privacy attacks are involved in the privacy performance evaluation, instead of only comparing the model utility performance. In addition, the presentations of prompt examples are misleading and confusing - the \"semantically-nearest retrieved\" should not be in-line with other prompt messages.\n\n- Setting a constraint in prompt generation\n\nIMHO, to avoid leak privacy information from generated prompts, one intuitive method could be adding some constraints during the prompt generation, such as \"do not provide examples in the prompt\", or \"do not use existing samples but create dummy samples as examples in the prompt\". I would suggest having a discussion whether this would be feasible."
