Therefore, the Bellman optimality equation at page 3 should not have $h$ in the footnote of the operator $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\n- the value function $\\overline{V_{k,1}}$ is never formally defined in the paper. So it is difficult to understand what it denotes when reading the regret decomposition in equation (6.1).\nIf I understood correctly from the Appendix, each mirror descent iterate $z_k$ induces via the marginals a transition kernel $\\overline{p_{k}}$ and a policy $\\pi_k$. At this point $\\overline{V_{k,1}}$ denotes the initial value of policy $\\pi_k$ in the MDP endowed with reward function $r_k$ and transition dynamics $\\bar{p}_k$. Can the authors confirm that this is correct and if yes add it to their revision ?\n\n- The definition of Regret at page 3 is a bit unclear. Indeed saying that $V^\\star_k$ is the optimal state value function could make the reader believe that $V^\\star_k = \\max_{\\pi} V^{\\pi}_k$, that is the regret we control has the maximum inside the sum. \nHowever, the regret controlled in the paper has a fixed comparator policy which might not be optimal for any of the reward function revealed at each round."

But even so, I think that the full-information feedback assumptions greatly alleviate the difficulty of adversarial rewards. To me, the hardness result is more interesting: an unbounded state space will incur regret in $\\Omega(\\sqrt{H})$. Is this result novel in the literature?\n\nI am a bit confused about the assumptions about the reward. Firstly, can the rewards be negative? If so, would assumption 3.1 still make sense? Furthermore, is assumption 3.1 equivalent to the bounded rewards assumption, i.e., if rewards are bounded in $[-R, R]$, we can always scale everything by $1/RH$ to satisfy assumption 3.1."
