Some description in the caption would help the reader to understand the whole algorithm while reading the introduction section.\n\n2. [Section 4.2]: The authors mentioned about obtaining q_phi(G,\\theta|Z) from existing Bayesian structure learning methods. A high-level description of these methods can be provided for the reader\u2019s convenience.\n\n3. The ancestral sampling method should be described more explicitly.\n\n4. [Section 5: Experiments] It is not specifically mentioned about the 3-layer neural network. For example what type of layers did the authors use? What is their dimension, and what activation functions were used? The training details can be provided in the appendix section.\n\nMajor concern:\n\n5. [Comparison with previous work]*Although the authors discussed different recent approaches in their related work section, they did not show how their approach is different from those and how their approaches outperform earlier works. For example, the authors cited Brehmer et al. (2022) who identify the causal structure and disentangle causal variables for arbitrary, unknown causal graphs with observations before and after intervention. The assumptions in this work seem to be more relaxed than the assumptions mentioned in this paper (linear Gaussian assumption, known intervention). It is not clearly specified what improvement this paper is doing compared to previous works.\n\n6. [Theoretical guarantee] The novelty of this paper seem to be provided in section 4.2 and 4.3 where they propose a deep learning approach to learn parameters \\theta and \\phi. These parameters allow us to sample the adjacency matrix and the covariance matrix. However, the authors did not discuss the identifiability of the SCM and the causal structure in detail. There is no theoretical guarantee that the algorithm will learn to sample true SCM and the causal structure. For example, the author\u2019s one cited work Brehmer et al. (2022) claims that they can find SCMs identifiable up to a relabelling and elementwise reparameterizations of the causal variables.\nWithout any theoretical identifiability, what is the guarantee that the algorithm will not overfit the training datasets?  What is the guarantee that the resultant SCM and structure will match the interventional distribution (ex: distribution shift) that was absent in the training data? \n\n7. [Baselines]: Although the authors discussed some approaches that deal with causal representation learning problems in the related work section, it is unclear why they could not find any common ground to show where they could show their comparative performance.\n\n8. [Synthetic experiments] The authors showed their performance on a 5-node DAG with 20 random interventions. The authors should perform more intensive experiments such as: for small to large graphs with varying edge density and varying interventions.\n\n9. [Real-world dataset] The authors used only synthetic and comparatively less complex datasets. The algorithm performance would be better observed on more complicated datasets such as Causal3DIdent [1] etc.\n\n[1] Self-Supervised Learning with Data Augmentations Provably Isolates Content from Style."

How is it determined which latent variables are being intervened on? \n4.

How is gradient descent being done without breaking the computational graph since the author performs sampling at lines 3 and 10? Is the loss terms differentiable with respect to \\phi and \\theta even though sampling is performed?\n\n7. What is the role of interventional datasets? How would the algorithm\u2019s performance change when the available data is from more or less number of interventions?  \n\n8. How does the algorithm perform for different-sized DAGs with varying edge density and varying interventions?\n9. What is the causal structure for the Chemistry dataset?

Recent studies have made significant progress in demonstrating the identifiability of latent causal models by exploring the change of weights, such as hard and soft interventions [1][2], on the model's weights. Nevertheless, there has been a noticeable absence of discussion regarding how our proposed method satisfies the assumptions necessary for achieving these identifiability results.\n\n2) Contributions: The primary contribution of this work lies in the development of a practical method for inferring latent causal models. However, from a technical perspective, the contributions are somewhat limited, as the technical details closely resemble those of previous work [3], even though this study uncovers causal models in a latent space. Additionally, as a practical method, the experiments conducted in this work are somewhat lacking in comprehensiveness. For instance, the image dataset utilized in this study is relatively simple, which may not sufficiently validate the advantages of the proposed method. To enhance the robustness of the findings, I would suggest the author consider using more complex datasets, such as Causal3DIdent in [4] and CausalCircuit in [1]. Furthermore, it is imperative to perform a comparative analysis of the proposed methods against existing approaches, such as those in [1].\n\n3) Several critical details remain unaddressed, such as the proposed method to ensure that the learned causal models conform to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure.\n\n\n[1] Brehmer, Johann, et al. \"Weakly supervised causal representation learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 38319-38331.\n[2] Liu, Yuhang, et al. \"Identifying weight-variant latent causal models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.14153 (2022).\n[3] Cundy, Chris, Aditya Grover, and Stefano Ermon. \"Bcd nets: Scalable variational approaches for bayesian causal discovery.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 7095-7110.\n[4] Von K\u00fcgelgen, Julius, et al. \"Self-supervised learning with data augmentations provably isolates content from style.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 34 (2021): 16451-16467."
