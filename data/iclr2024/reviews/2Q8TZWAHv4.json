GOTt is shown to be applicable to different GNN architectures, including GCN, GraphSAGE, and GIN. It outperforms various SOTA GNN explanation baselines in terms of fidelity, discriminability, and stability as demonstrated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world data. The authors also provide qualitative case studies to show that GOAt can identify the most important nodes and edges in the input graph that contribute to the output prediction and that it can also detect the presence of adversarial attacks and the robustness of the GNN model."

I am a bit confused about how the coverage for the stability measure is computed. Can the authors explain more? Also, although coverage for BA-2Motifs is high for GOAt, it is very low on Mutagenicity and NCI1 for all methods. Any discussions about this observation?"
