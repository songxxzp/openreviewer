                "value": "In recent times, graph pre-training for graph representation learning has gained prominence, with numerous pre-training tasks emerging. Integrating knowledge from various pre-training tasks is now a focal research area. Two critical collaborative processes for integration are: (1) selecting the best task combination considering their compatibility and (2) determining the importance of the chosen tasks. While much research has been on weighing tasks, selection has received lesser attention. This paper introduces a new instance-level framework named Weigh And Select (WAS) that merges both processes using decoupled Siamese networks. WAS adaptively determines the best task combination for individual instances, leading to a tailored instance-level task weighing strategy. Experiments across 16 graph datasets reveal WAS's efficacy, producing results comparable to top-performing methods by merging several basic tasks."

While 4 questions are clear in the identification of the 4 steps/issues to address, the solutions are quite standard. E.g. using Gumbel-Softmax sampling for Bernoulli distribution,  the weighting scheme and the Siamese network architecture are all well known tools.\n\nW3.
