Since these two prompt tuning schemes were not first proposed by this paper, it is better to demonstrate the unique contributions of the prompt tuning part. \n\n3. It is still implicit why the visual prompts can help detect the correlation between an input image and the domains and how this can help alleviate the domain shift problem. \n\n4.
