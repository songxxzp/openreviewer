But there is no equation 6 in the main part of the paper. Does the authors refer to the equation 6 in the appendix? Then the authors should put this equation in the main part of the submission.\n\n2. In Corollary 2.1.1 the authors mention the linear convergence rate, but what is the exact or explicit upper bound for this linear convergence rate? The authors should explicitly present this linear convergence rate not just present an asymptotical convergence result.\n\n3. In Corollary 2.1.2, the authors claimed that the algorithm can cover the quadratical convergence rate of Newton's method. However, the inequality in this corollary only shows the linear convergence. Because $\\|g_t\\| \\geq 2\\alpha(L(\\theta_t) - L(\\theta_*))$, we can get that $L(\\theta_{t + 1}) - L(\\theta_*) \\leq (1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\beta^2})(L(\\theta_t) - L(\\theta_*))$. However, this is only linear convergence rate. It's not quadratical convergence rate as Newton's method. And the linear convergence rate is even worse than the gradient descent of $1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$\n\n4. There is no overall theorem for the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm. We need a specific detailed theoretical convergence rate of the PSGD to make comparison with other methods.\n\n5. The authors didn't give any theoretical analysis for the step size. They only presented some empirical results for the step size choices."

Taking into account, that purpose of preconditioning is in fact getting rid of conditioning number impact, theory seems to fail (in non-convex case).\n2. Another criterion from Lin's original papers leads to Fisher matrix as an optimal preconditioner. Can you explain why this important case was left outside of the framework you propose? This case is interesting because it has no quasi-Newton property, but is greedy-optimal for quaite natural criterion at the same time.
