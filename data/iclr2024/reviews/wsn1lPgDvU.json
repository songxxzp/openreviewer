What accounts for this discrepancy?\n- If the odds ratio (OR) is already displaying high bias, why did you introduce the concept of relative RMSE? Why not employ RMSE and compare it to the OR in addition?\n-In the section on covariate balancing, the paper references Xue et al. 2023, which assumes independent censoring. I believe your method makes a similar assumption. If this is not the case, could you please clarify?"

Is it optimal/minimal?\n\nA recently proposed causal survival forest (Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects with right-censored data via causal survival forests, Cui et al. 2023 JRSSB) can also be used to evaluate $\\psi^{a,t}$.

Introduction: related work (section 4) should be moved to introduction.  I also recommend that authors only cite and discuss literature that is truly relevant/important to their work.\n3. Setting: section 2.3 is really confusing. A lot of notation without explanation. It is more natural to introduce notation only when it needs to be used.\n4. Approach: it reads like a stack of math techniques. Unimportant derivations or formulas can be omitted. More explanation would be helpful.\n5.
