Prior works relied on Monte Carlo approximation of expectation in calculating SW distance. The authors propose to substitute it with Quasi-MC approximation of expectation which results in lower approximation error. The main idea behind it is to pick a deterministic set of uniformly distributed points (low-discrepancy sequences) instead of sampling them randomly as in standard MC. The authors propose and evaluate four different strategies to obtain these low-discrepancy sequences on the unit hypersphere, all suitable for QMC calculation of SW distance. They prove that QSW converges to SW in the case of infinite integration points.\n\nAdditionally, they propose a randomized version of QSW which they prove to be an unbiased estimator of SW, which allows for unbiased estimation of SW gradients, which leads to improved optimization with RQSW objective.\n\nIn the experiments, the authors: (1) show the reduction of the SW approximation error by computing all the different distance approximations between point clouds sampled on the surfaces of 3D shapes; (2) perform point cloud interpolation and image style transfer by interpolation using the gradients of different approximations; (3) train an autoencoder for point clouds using QSW and RQSW as training objectives. (1) and (2) show considerable improvements compared to the baseline SW estimation with MC. For (3) there are improvements but the results seem not to be statistically significant."

This paper sheds new light on the faithfulness of SW estimating beyond MC regime.\n2. The paper provides a thorough investigation of the construction of equally-spaced points on the unit sphere, which is of wider interest as it is in general an open problem on 2 dimensions and beyond. The proposed methods all seem promising, and their incorporation into machine learning tasks seems interesting.\n3.

The contributions seem limited, as the paper mainly applies existing QMC methods to SW estimation, whereas little was investigated on how QMC and SW interact. Specifically, the paper claims that the Koksma-Hlawka inequality is the main guarantee of lower absolute error. While all listed QMC methods do achieve low discrepancy, on the SW side it does not seem trivial to claim that the SW integrand satisfies the smoothness assumption for the absolute error bound to hold. For instance, for general $\\mu,\\nu$, the integrand $W_p^p(\\theta\\mu,\\theta\\nu)$ only seems to be Lipschitz in $\\theta$, which does not imply bounded HK variation in higher dimensions [1]. The BV condition should be verified before claiming the applicability of the inequality.\n2. Related to the previous item, when applying the Koksma-Hlawka inequality, the discrepancy was empirical CDF error. It is unclear why the paper then switches to spherical cap discrepancy, and how this is connected to the Koksma-Hlawka inequality. The reviewer agrees that this is a better measurement of the uniformity on sphere, but is not sure about how this directly contributes to bounding the absolute error.\n\n[1] Basu, Kinjal, and Art B.

And which is applicable to obtain the overall error bound for the proposed estimator?\n2. Integration over the sphere is a classical numerical analysis problem. Another class of method that seems reasonable is cubature, see [1], with the most notable difference being that the weight is not uniform. Is it possible to use this class of method for estimation of SW? It seems the smoothness requirement for cubature is not any worse than that for QMC in the paper.\n\n[1] Hesse, Kerstin, Ian H.
