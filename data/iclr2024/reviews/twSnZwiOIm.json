For example, Algorithm 1 is rather terse, and a more expanded version would be instructive to the reader. It's hard to get birds-eye view of the method because the explanation is spread throughout the text. Perhaps a separate section in the supplementary materials that gives a more direct explanation of the method would help the reader.\n- The method requires computing covariance matrices of neural network outputs, which could affect the computation if the output dimension is high.\n- I have some reservations about the experiments:\n    - In the beginning paragraph of section \"5 Experiments\", the authors state they only optimize over the learning rate to keep things fair, but I can't seem to find the set of learning rates that were optimized over.\n    - On the previous point, the authors state at the top of page 7 that the mini-batch size should be sufficiently large to mitigate the impact of biased stochastic estimators. But, some neural network models benefit from the mini-batch stochasticity of SGD, as opposed to full-batch normal gradient descent. In this case, I would have liked to have seen optimizing over the batch sizes as well, and not just the learning rate.\n    - I'm also not sure if optimizing over just the learning rate this is completely fair. I would have liked to see optimizing over more hyperparameters, or at least in addition to the current experiments, to also provide the performance evaluation of the original model implemented in the paper, if possible. For example, in the fluid flow example, Azencot et al. (2022) has a similar fluid flow example, but uses a different architecture and I would have liked to see this one in comparison to the author's method.\n    - In the molecular dynamics example, I see Ghorbani et al. (2022) have done similar experiments, but at a smaller scale. Even though the authors performed their experiment at a larger scale, I would have liked to have seen a comparison with Ghorbani et al. (2022) at the smaller scale, or even at the larger scale. This would allow comparing accuracy and training times."

Would this be the case for most practical applications?\n- On page 7 in \"Downstream tasks\", in order to make predictions of the next step, the authors need to compute: $(\\hat{\\Psi}_{w}^\\top)^\\dagger$, i.e. the pseudo-inverse, is that right? If so, it seems this would slow down the computation of the predicted next steps, so how do the computation times compare with other methods for predicting next steps? Any numerical instabilities?\n- In Algorithm 1, the authors use $\\hat{\\mathcal{S}}^\\gamma_m$, implying this is the relaxed version, is that right? If so, this isn't stated anywhere in Algorithm 1. Perhaps the authors should have two Algorithms that gives the regular DPNets and also DPNets-relaxed.\n- When training the unrelaxed DPNets, how was $\\mathcal{P}^\\gamma$ evaluated? It is stated in page 5 that in general the covariances are non-invertible and thus $\\mathcal{P}^\\gamma$ is non-differentiable during the optimization. Also, as the authors state, the use of the pseudo-inverse can introduce numerical instabilities. How much of a problem is this, in your experience? I see that some experiments were unable to use unrelaxed DPNets because of this.\n- For Figure 3, in the upper panel - \"Ordered MNIST accuracy\", I'd imagine that the \"Reference\" (dashed-line) is just random guessing, i.e. $1/5 = 0.2$? I don't see this stated anywhere, and would like it explicitly stated.\n- For Figure 3 in the lower panel, \"Fluid Flow RMSE\", how many prediction steps were taken? Namely, what are the values of the $x$-axis?\n\n**Remarks:**\n- On page 5, on the line above equation (8), the authors say \"we show in Lem. 3 in App. B\", but I think you mean Section C in the appendix/supplementary materials.\n- On page 6, in \"Learning the representation\", might also need to state that we are also given $\\psi'$, i.e. \" In practice,given a NN architecture $\\psi$ and $\\psi$'. \""

However, the empirical evaluation of the method is not completely convincing, and some points are not clear.  \n\n\nIn addition, even the relaxed objective introduced in the paper is computationally heavy. It involves \ncomputing the covariannce matrices as _differentiable functions_. This means the computation graph involves summing $n$ matrices of size $r \\times r$, each coordinate of which is a differnetiable function. \nAs noted in the paper, minibatches could be used but would introduce bias. Even with minibatches, the \nrepresentation dimension $r$ would have to stay low, and appears to be low in all experiments (in which it was specified). \n\n\nA more detailed notes on experiments:\n\n**Ordered MNIST:** My understanding is that this example is new in this paper. Is there an explanation/intuition why other methods fails here? Are convolutional networks used to model the \nrespresentation? I assume the non NN methods fail simply since representing images is easier with convolutions. Why do other methods fail? I believe explaining the difference here could make the paper considerably stronger. \n\n\n**Logistic Map:** The takeaway here is not clear.  DPNets has the worst spectral error among all methods. \nIn addition, there appears to be no theoretical reason why DPNets-realxed should perform better on this metric, as it was introduced as a computational relaxation. Do the suggest it has properties allowing it to be a better estimator in general? \n\n**Continuous dynamics:**\nThe scale of Fig. 2 lower pane is that of 200. This makes is very hard to understand whether the smaller \neigenvalues are estimated accurately and what is the order of magnitude.  Displaying ratios estimated/true would be more informative. Also, are there other ways to estimate the eigenvalues? \n\n\n**FlowRMSE:**\nThe general magnitude of the quantities in this experiment is not clear.  If the quantities are of order 10, then the difference between errors of order 0.1 and 0.001 is less impactful, and all methods perform well. \nWhat are the typical values of the quantities for which RMSE is computed? Again, percentage ratios would be much clearer than absolute values. \n\n\n\n**Chignolin Experiment:**\n In Table 2, describing the Chignolin experiment, while estimated quantities are somewhat closer to the reference values than the true quantities, they still look quite far. It is thus not clear what is the point of this part of the experiment.  \nThe second part of that experiment, involving Fig.4, unfortunately can not be understood from the main text. (what is the free energy surface, what is known about its proper minima, why matching the results of Bonati et al   is of interest? )."
