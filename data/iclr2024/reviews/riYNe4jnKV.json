For example, we can use $e, f$ to represent the metrics, and $A, B$ to represent the pipelines. $h$ represents the model name. It is redundant since it is a subset of the pipeline. Please reduce the usage of necessary superscripts and subscripts.\n2. The paper focuses on the comparisons between two pipelines, which was not necessary. The paper should pay attention to the variance reduction in the performance evaluation of pipelines, i.e., the equation at the bottom of Page 2. For example, the histograms in Figure 1 are good visualization for the variance reduction. Please add similar figures for other experiments.\n3. How do we handle the bias-variance tradeoff in the equation at the bottom of Page 2?\n4. The Calibrated Loss for multiclass classification is the existing method of \"Temperature Scaling\". Why is it a proposed method? What is the contribution on that in this paper?\n5. Calibration of the evaluation results is a general topic. The paper lacks discussions and comparisons of the related work.\n6. In Section 4, there is less randomness with a larger test dataset. The original metric $e$ is good enough for evaluation. The difference between $e_1$ and $e$ will become smaller with a larger $n$. However, for the $e_1$, we may need to split the test dataset into two disjoint subsets, one for calibration and one for true evaluation, which will decrease the effective dataset size $n$. In that case, can we claim that $e_1$ is better than $e$? If $n=2$, $e$ can use the average of these two samples to obtain the final result, while $e_1$ should use one example for calibration and use the other one as the final result. In this case, which case is better? What if $n=10k$ and even infinity?\n\n### Minor issues\n1. Please number every equation in the paper.\n2. In Equation 3, $R_e(h)$ is a random variable. A is better than B iff $P(R_e(h_A) < R_e(h_B)) > 0.5$. However, we usually use expectation or its estimations to compare A and B. Specifically, A is better than B iff $\\mathbb{E}(R_e(h_A)) < \\mathbb{E}(R_e(h_B))$. For example, we mainly compare the average classification accuracy. Equation 3 seems uncommon, which may require further discussions and citations.\n3. The theoretical justification is only on the linear regression, and the randomness only comes from the dataset, which is limited. A more general setting (e.g., convex problem, randomness in SGD) is expected."

My understanding is that the proposed framework applied a posthoc calibration on the trained model using a calibration set to adjust model prediction, then used the same loss function(cross-entropy loss for classification and $L_2$ loss for regression) to the adjusted model output on a separate test set. Frame it as a new loss is a bit confusing\n\n2. The $\\text{Acc}(\\bar{e})$ defined in equation 5 relies on a ground truth metric, which makes the framework a bit hard to interpret. For example, in the CIFAR10 experiment, accuracy and log loss give different comparison results, I think this can happen because the larger model overfits in terms of cross-entropy loss, but accuracy doesn't drop(e.g. Figure 3 in [1]). The larger model is more accurate but not well-calibrated[1]. In the paper, it says \"this metric inconsistency can be mitigated by Calibrated Log Loss\", but I think a better way to explain the result is that after applying the posthoc calibration method, the larger model can have better calibration(in terms of cross-entropy loss).\n\n3. Some subtle issues: \n\n(1) accuracy is used as the ground truth metric in CIFAR10 experiments, but a model with higher accuracy or lower loss is better, this can cause some problems in the definition 3. \n\n(2) On top of page 4, it says the bias-adjusted predictions $q_i$ are well-calibrated. But calibration usually means $E(Y|f(X)) = f(X)$ for all $f(X)$, the property only says the calibration error is 0 if evaluated using only 1 bin. So I think the claim is not appropriate.\n\n(3) For the Generalization to Quadratic Loss, $e_1$ is defined using $E_{D}$, I think $E_{D}$ needs to be estimated on the val-test set, would it be better to define $e_1$ using $E_{\\hat{D}_{\\text{val-test}}}$?\n\n\n### Reference \n[1] Guo, Chuan, et al. \"On calibration of modern neural networks.\" International conference on machine learning.

The main idea is to calibrate the \"bias\" of the deep learning model that contributes to the randomness in evaluating them. The algorithm is proposed to split the test set into test-val and test-remaining splits and then using the test-val set to calibrate the model predictions before calculating the metric values. The accuracy of the proposed metric itself is also defined as the probability that a better model A will be measured as being better by the proposed metric.\nThe evaluation of the proposed metrics is done using deep CTR prediction and image classification."

                "value": "- I am not fully convinced that the proposed algorithm is realistic. For instance, to obtain the calibrated metric one must have a separate validation set, which is not always the case. One could split the test set into test-val and test-test splits like described in the submission, but that means using a different set of data to test the model, which in itself would be another problem. Furthermore, the calibrated metric seems to be model and data specific as it uses a specific model's predictions and validation data to calibrate the bias term. This would lead to evaluating multiple models which all use individually different metrics. I do not particularly think that would be a step towards robust and fair comparison of deep learning models."
