The paper establish a scenario that querying LLM is expensive; however, it seems constructing the kernel function with BertScore needs also needs to querying the LLM extensively, and that seems also expensive.\n2. One point has not been discussed is the variance of the $ \\log p_{\\theta} (\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}})$  (also please use uppercase letter to denote the random variable for the mathematical rigorousness). The proposed method replaces $ \\log p_{\\theta} (\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}})$ with a a surrogate function $f$, such that numerous text examples can be used to get the empirical estimation of $E\\left[f\\left(\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\right)\\right]$. On one hand, the variance of such an empirical estimation would be reduced as surrogate function $f$ can be inexpensively accessed; on the other hand, there is bias between $E\\left[ \\log p_{\\theta} (\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}})\\right]$ and $E\\left[f\\left(\\tilde{\\mathbf{X}}\\right)\\right]$. I was hoping to see the analysis of the impact of the variance and bias on the performance of the method, but failed to found them in both methodology and experimental sections."

                "value": "- The biggest drawback of the paper for me is the *evaluation*. I feel that the current evaluation is lacking in many aspects and feels incomplete:\n    - **Limited Open-Source LLMs Considered**: First, only 2 LLMs are utilized, one of which is GPT-2, which is more than 4 years old. The other model used is Llama-1 (65B), although the Llama-2 sets of models have been released for quite some time now. Since there are a number of different open-source LLMs (for obtaining logits in the white-box setting) available with different parameter sizes, the authors should undertake a comprehensive evaluation across many more LLMs: for example, Llama-2, Guanaco, Vicuna, Falcon, MPT, ChatGLM, etc. Even for the experiments of Section 4.3, only smaller models such as GPT-J and GPT-Neo are used. Considering only 2 models (one of which is GPT-2) is not sufficient for evaluation of current performance of the proposed method.\n    - **Trends With Respect to Parameter Size**: An obvious question to ask is (irrespective of query size), as the models considered have an increasing number of parameters, does the proposed method become less efficacious? Compared to DetectGPT, how many queries would be required to successfully detect text generated by a more advanced model such as Llama2-70B? I believe the authors could undertake these experiments given that for a number of LLMs (such as Llama) different parameter size models are available (7B, 13B, 70B). It would be interesting to observe performance curves for different classes (with respect to size) of LLMs.\n    - **Lack of Analysis on Black-box Models**: I feel that the mismatch setting of Section 4.3 should be further augmented with a black-box setting where state-of-the-art black-box LLMs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM-2, Claude, etc. are analyzed. If the goal of the paper is to truly ensure that LLM generated text is detected, the authors should ideally evaluate on these models via proxy models. As these LLMs are the easiest to use due to a user interface, LLM generated text is most likely to stem from these as sources. It would be beneficial to incorporate some evaluation along these lines.\n    - **Overall Lack of Experimental Rigor**: I find some of the claims made in the paper to be hand-wavy and lacking sufficient rigor. For example, on page 7 (Section 4.1 end), the authors state that even under high query budgets, their approach remains effective and comparable to DetectGPT. However, only the WritingPrompts data is used with GPT-2. To clearly make such a point, more experiments should be conducted over all datasets and all LLMs and presented as a table or figure. Then adequate conclusions can be drawn.\n\n- While a minor issue, the paper has many typos and grammatical errors. I believe the authors should go through the paper and correct these in the revision. For example, page 7: \"bedget\" -> \"budget\", and page 4: \"typicity\" means something unrelated to statistics and ML, etc."
