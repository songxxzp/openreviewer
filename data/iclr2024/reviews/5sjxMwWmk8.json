This problem appears in various applications, such as sensor network localization, phase retrieval, and distributed clock synchronization. The paper also extends the problem to a heterogeneous setting, named $k$-synchronization, where the goal is to estimate multiple groups of angles simultaneously from noisy observations.\n\nTo overcome the poor performance of existing methods in high-noise regimes, the authors propose GNNSync, a novel framework based on directed GNNs. The framework is end-to-end trainable and incorporates theoretically-grounded techniques to improve robustness to noise."

While for standard algorithms such as GPM, we have well-established theoretical guarantees for certain types of noise.\n\n2. While the paper performs extensive experiments, the comparison with the baseline under high noise level seems not convincing. When we have a certain noise level, the standard way is to first provide an initial guess by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem, then projecting to the SO(2) space and aligning with anchors (if they exist). Finally, Riemannian/projected gradient descent is used to finetune the solution by minimizing a loss function (which can be adjusted based on the noise level). It seems GNNSYNC consists of multiple stages while there is no further fine-tuning steps for the baseline methods. \n\nMinors\n* The paper mentions that the motivation for k-synchronization is practically interesting because of some applications in structural biology, but it seems no experiments are conducted on biological applications. Also, even the 'real-world' dataset is perturbed artificially, which makes it not easy to see if the method can generalize well.\n* As mentioned by the authors, GNNSYNC shares many similarities with the GNNRank framework.\n* Currently, GNNSYNC is limited to SO(2) group."

I would appreciate it if the authors could justify that the proposed method is exactly better than the standard method with fine-tuning (by using either the standard log-likelihood function or the newly designed loss functions.)"
