The motivation of the proposed Wasserstein distortion distance measure is to simultaneously address pixel-level fidelity as well as realism based on the theory of human vision system. \n\nFrom the reference image, a sequence of probability measures is defined. Each measure in the sequence represents the statistics of the features pooled across a region centered at a location. The given reference image is covered with overlapping pooling regions of various sizes. Each region is associated a distribution obtained by computing various features at random locations within the region. The overall distortion between two images is defined to be the Wasserstein distance between the distributions summed over the pooling regions. The proposed distortion measure reduces to pure fidelity and pure realism as the size of the pooling region tends to zero and infinity, respectively. This enables generation of textures that have high fidelity to a reference texture in one location of the image and a smooth transition to an independent realization of the texture as one moves away from this point."

For instance, one could adapt the approach of [Ref1] which can control the spatial distribution of textures according to user-specified annotation maps. I do agree that the proposed Wasserstein distortion enables smooth interpolation between fidelity and realism however, it needs to be demonstrated that the proposed approach is superior to other possible methods.\n\nComparison in terms of computational requirements of the proposed scheme and existing approaches could have been discussed.\n\n[Ref1] Neural Texture Synthesis With Guided Correspondence CVPR 2023"

The specific setting of equation (12) has been empirically evaluated for texture synthesis against Gatys and Portilla-Simoncelli by Vacher et al (Neurips 2020). (ii) in the small $\\sigma$ limit this is the exact reconstruction of an image from its feature\n- the numerical experiments illustrate the nature of sigma but I do not see in which it contributes to vision study (even in terms of methods)"
