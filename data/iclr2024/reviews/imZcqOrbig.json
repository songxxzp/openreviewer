                "value": "Although I like the concept, I think the evaluation should be improved. In particular, I am concerned about the weight initialization scheme used. The paper states that only the weights of the encoder are re-used for initialization since it leads to better performance. However, all previous approaches have used the pre-trained weights from the encoder and decoder. Therefore, it is difficult to assess if this pre-training setup improves over previous work. Since this work uses the same backbone as previous pre-training works and these methods provide pre-trained weights, it would be easy and necessary to provide a comparison of fine-tuned models for previous works where only the encoder is reused. Moreover, numbers for a fine-tuned model with the proposed method where the decoder weights are also reused should be provided. With this experiment, we will be able to assess if this is only necessary for the proposed pre-training method or if all pre-training strategies suffer from it. More importantly, we will be able to assess if the described improvement on the paper really comes from the pre-training strategy or from the fine-tuning setup used. I would rate the paper as marginally above acceptance and I would change my rating after rebuttal when these numbers are available.\n\nMoreover, it is not clear the masking ratio ablation experiment. There is no description in the methods section of any masking applied during pre-training, so I think it will be necessary to clarify how this masking is applied during pre-training."

Next, the key idea is to make the projected image features close to their counterparts that are pretrained using powerful 2D vision foundation models such as Dinov2, CLIP, SAM. Additionally, to realize multi-view consistency, another module is adapted to maintain the point correspondences across different views, yielding the whole proposed method called MVNet.

Note that it is not convincing enough to only give a few results in Table 2 of the supplementary material without detailed explanations and more comprehensive experiments. \n\n(2) Furthermore, the experimental comparison with previous point cloud pre-training approaches is problematic because the adopted backbone models differ. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training framework, the authors should make sure that the performance gains are not from the stronger backbone. \n\n(3) For scene-level experiments, the authors perform pre-training on ScanNet and fine-tune on ScanNet, S3DIS, and SUN RGB-D.

Therefore, the actual transferability, which is known to be a key consideration factor for a pre-training method, is questionable.
