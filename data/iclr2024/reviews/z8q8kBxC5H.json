First, recall that a matrix is _double-stochastic_ if it has non-negative entries, each row sums to 1, and each column sums to 1. Then, for all pairs $(K,m)$ where $K=1,...,\\infty$ and $m = 1,...,m-1$, we want to know if there exists a rotation matrix $Q \\in R^{k \\times k}$ such that $Q J_{K,m} Q^\\intercal$ is double-stochastic, where $J_{K,m} = \\text{diag}(1+\\text{max}\\\\{0,2m-K\\\\}, 1, ...,1, -1, ..., -1)$ is a diagonal matrix with $K$ rows and columns and exactly $m$ many -1's in it.\n\nFor the NIEP, the authors show that a large range of $(K,m)$ pairs either do or do not admit such a matrix $Q$. Many different constructions for such $Q$ are provided, with motivations behind these constructions varying between the _Haar Basis_, the _Discrete Fourier Transform_, a mixture of the Haar Basis and DFT, and _Fielder's Approach_.\n\nSeveral $(K,m)$ pairs are not covered by this analysis, and the authors use a heuristic algorithm to show that some of these pairs likely admit a $Q$ matrix. These are the only experiments in the paper.\n\nThe NIEP is related to the **NMF** (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) Problem. Here, we are given a non-negative rank-$K$ matrix $\\Omega \\in R^{n \\times n}$. We want to find a non-negative tall-and-skinny matrix $\\Pi \\in R^{n \\times K}$ and non-negative diagonal matrix $P\\in R^{K \\times K}$ such that $\\Omega = \\Pi P \\Pi^\\intercal$. This problem is computational, and not a pure math question. By studying these various cases for the NIEP, it becomes clear that NMF is solvable in many regimes with a simple algorithm."

                "value": "The paper studies a mathematically interesting question (NIEP), and seems to use novel constructions to answer this question. There's a lot of care and precision put into characterizing how to build these $Q$ matrices, and a really wide variety of tools are called in to participate in this task.\n\nNMF is also a problem that's known to be interesting. If I ask around the office, people have heard of it, and know that it matters. So, there's certainly significance in improving our knowledge of when this problem is solvable, and how to solve it.\n\nThe relationship between NIEP and NMF seems to be nice and crisp. A good amount of attention is paid to showing that the authors' solution to the pure math NIEP problem implies simple algorithmic solutions to the NMF problem. This focus on pragmatism in a theoretical paper is also good and appreciated.\n\nThe writing in the paper is clear (though almost always focuses on the wrong subject matter; see \"weaknesses\"). I appreciate the effort taken to represent many different cases in a single paper, though I do believe this somewhat misses the point of what the paper should be trying to convey."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "This paper cannot be accepted in its current state. At its core,\n- The paper lacks a clear discussion in its own right that the NIEP and NMF problems are well motivated. There are exactly 2 sentences that motivate the problem studied. Instead of actually motivating the problem, these sentences instead say that someone else wrote down a good motivation. This is vastly insufficient evidence, and the paper should motivate its own problem clearly.\n\n$\\phantom{.}$\n\n- The body of the paper contains many constructions for $Q$ matrices that solve the NIEP for various $(K,m)$ pairs. It does not, however, justify _at all_ why these constructions should work, or **any intuition at all**.\n    - For a theoretical paper, this is devastating. It leaves me with no confidence that the results are correct, and the appendix is out of scope of the typical review. _(I read a bit of the appendix, to get a flavor of Theorem 2 for instance, but it was fairly cold and not laden with any helpful intuition)_\n    - It would be much better to describe constructions in the appendix, and intuitively explain the ideas behind constructions in the body of the paper.\n\nAt the core of the issue of the paper are the above two issues: the paper lacks motivation, and makes no attempt to convince me of its correctness.\n\nA lesser issue is that I do not understand if this paper is a good fit for ICLR, or really any other ML conference. The body of the paper feels a like pure math with a coat of paint on it to give it the rough shape of an ML paper. This harkens back to the motivation a bit (an unmotivated theoretical paper looks like pure math to me), but also the NIEP feels not-ML-like to me. I hesitate to get to gate-keepy about this, so I won't strongly hold this against the paper. A stronger connection to the practice of ML would go a long way.\n\n---\n\nI'll backup my bullet points above with some concrete evidence.\n\nThe two sentences in my first point can be found after problem (2) on page 2. Admittedly, there's some motivating sentences in the conclusion too, but that's far too late and don't actually discuss any additional motivations.\n\nThe lack of intuition and justification can be seen throughout the paper, on pages 2-6 and page 8. The most brutal examples might be the following three:\n- On page 3, the first paragraph of section 1.2 states that 4 different techniques are used to design $Q$ matrices. No explanation for why these methods work is ever given. No discussion of what similar methods would or wouldn't work. No lessons to learn at all.\n- On page 4, Theorems 2, 3, and 4 are all stated without any justification or argument whatsoever. They are simply stated.\n- The top half of page 5 is devoted to define some intricate constructions for $Q$ matrices related to the discrete fourier transform. These constructions are followed by two theorems which state that these $Q$ matrices resolve the NIEP for some $(K,m)$ pairs. No reason connecting the construction to the theorem is given; no reason that these intricate $Q$'s are useful.\n\nI believe that the subject matter of this paper could be published at a good venue. In the current presentation, I cannot accept this to ICLR, and I remain unclear if any ML conference is a good fit. But these seems like good research results that belong in some published venue."

                "value": "These are general minor edits, typos, ect. Feel free to ignore all of these if you want to.\n\n1. [throughout the paper] Be sure that when you cite someone, you keep parenthesis around the citation. Not having those parenthesis makes a lot of sentences kinda hard to read. (e.g. first sentence of the introduction).\n1. [throughout the paper] The language of NIEP being \"solvable\" is deeply confusing language. In the view of computer science, it's a deterministic problem -- for each $(K,m)$ pair there exactly 1 hardcoded answer, so the problem is \"solvable\". The question is really if $Q$ exists for this particular $(K,m)$ pair, which should not use the word \"solvable\". Instead say something like \"$J_{K,m}$ can be made doubly stochastic\". Or use some other phrase that sounds information-theoretic and not computational.\n1. [throughout the paper] The notation of $4 | K$ is not typical in any literature I've worked in. Define this if your going to use it.\n1. [page 2] Discuss condition (B) more. It's really unintuitive, and looks almost impossible to satisfy at a glance. You describe this as the \"sharpest\" possible bound, but I have no clue what that actually means. Assume your audience hasn't ever seen NMF before, but is interested in learning more about it.\n1. [page 2] Is there a reason to omit the proof of lemma 1 instead of appendicizing it? Why not just appendicize?\n1. [page 2, paragraph before \"The Matrix Q\"] I really like this paragraph. Good paragraph and summary!\n1. [page 4] This \"particularly hard and takes a long time to figure out\" is not really paper-writing-language. I think this is called being \"overly editorialized\". You can call it intricate or something, but really you don't need to include this parenthetical at all. Alternatively, you could actually describe what made the proof so tricky and clever.\n1. [page 4] I think that $H^*$ needs to be composed of $[h_{K,2}, ..., h_{K,m+1}]$ in order for $U$ to be orthogonal?\n1. [page 4] Why include Theorem 6 if its implies by Theorem 10. Just cut theorem 6.\n1. [page 6] The \"the reason why\" sentence really isn't a reason. The sentence doesn't explain why your construction _conceptually_ fails here.\n1. [page 8]  Why do you pick $tr(M \\hat M_0)$ to be the optimization objective? Also, why not use a uniform-at-random orthonormal matrix $\\hat M_0$ -- it's not really going to make a difference in practice but seems more conceptually sound.\n\nDo not assume that the readers know:\n- What the Haar basis matrix is\n- What a Perron root is\n- What the Stiefel manifold is\n\nand be sure to define these terms before you use them."
