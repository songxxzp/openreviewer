Then, the authors find that quantization and pruning are utilized to deal with the efficiency problem while incurring performance issues, i.e., the PPL of the model is high. Then, the authors propose a soft prompt approach to improve the performance of the quantized or pruned model. In addition, the authors validate three aspects of the proposed methods, i.e., cross dataset transferability, cross compression transferability, and cross-task transferability."
