Previous losses (e.g. CD, EMD) focus on the point-to-point distances as the supervision, which brings lots of computational cost or easily reaches a local minimum. The proposed DDF loss measures the distance and directions to the underlying surface.\n\n2. The performance seems good, which outperforms the widely used CD, EMD and DCD."

                "value": "1. The name directional distance field is not suitable. I do not understand what is it until I finished reading the method section. The 'field' often indicates the signed distances or occupancies learned by a neural network. The proposed loss to measure distances from a reference point to the underline surface is not a 'field'.\n\n2. The presentation can be improved.  I suggest that the authors to improve the writings in the introduction to make the readers understand the loss more easily. The inappropriate name 'directional distance field' and the unexplained 'reference point' make the introduction not clear enough. I can not understand the loss until I finish reading the method section, but finally I find the loss quite simple.\n\n3. In Fig. 3, I find that DCD achieves quite good performances, why is the quantitative results of DCD in Tab. 1 that bad? More comparisons are needed.\n\n4.  As shown in Fig.4, DDF is less efficient than CD and DCD. What is reason? Since CD measures point-to-point distances which should be much slower."

This lack of comparison is an important weakness as the proposed method resembles the common pipeline of \n1)  Computing keypoints, here by using a sampling mechanism plus noise;\n2) Obtaining descriptors at each keypoint, here as the concatenation of the magnitude and direction of a sum of weighted distances between a keypoint and the K-NN of a point cloud. \n\nThe proposed distance aggregates descriptor distances. Here, descriptor correspondences result from sharing the same keypoints to obtain each set of descriptors. \n\nAnother weakness is in formulations that should be presented more clearly, perhaps improving notation. For example, it is unclear why \"g(qm, P1) and g(qm, P2) share identical weights\". From equations, they seem to be different as calculated over different point clouds. \n\nAdditional \n\nIn Sec. 4.2,  R should be in SO(3). \n\nAlso, there is some abuse of notation when applying a rotation over a point cloud. \n\nThe registration methods Opt-EMD, Opt-CD, Opt-ARL and Opt-Ours require better explanation."
