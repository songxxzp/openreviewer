Authors treat the training of a state-space model (SSM or linear RNN) as an estimation of regularized linear functional $\\mathbf{H}$, and proves that the normal SSM with stable approximation shows exponential decay and thus cannot estimate functions with non-exponential decay. Then, it is proved that using reparameterization such as softplus can alleviate this problem, and also suggest optimal reparameterization operator for the given task."

Why parametrize only the poles of the SSM implicitly, and not also the residues? \n* Have you considered the effect of the entire architecture block, composed of gating and the SSM, on the choice of parametrization? Could that inform a better metric that better correlated with performance in practice?\n* Can you provide some downstream evaluation of the language model, or at the very least validation loss?\n\n\nSome nitpicks:\n* Eq (2) does not correspond to practical instantiation of SSM-based models, which have linear readout ($c^T h_t$), then a pointwise shallow MLP (either with gating or without)."
