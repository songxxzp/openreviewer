Though this work argues that utilizing label descriptions in a bayesian form benefits the performance, it relies heavily on the quality of the label description, e.g., how clear the context can present the task, domain the label. However, in text classification, sometimes the label is not natural language, but a less literally meaningful symbol. For such labels, it is not likely to encourage the model to generate text $x$ given $y$. Then it requires human beings to provide very good summaries or descriptions for such labels, which is sometimes challenging. Such a problem limits the application of the proposed GEN-Z framework. Instead, conventional in-context learning can provide examples and have the model to learn from simpler label descriptions and demonstrations, which is more flexible.\n\n2. Since label descriptions directly decides how the model generates $x$, the quality of $z_i$ plays an important role on the performance. It is encouraged to explore how the performance is influenced if descriptions of different quality are given. For example, if the label can already express the meaning of the label, then descriptions may not be required. When the label meaning is more abstract, detailed descriptions may be better than abstract descriptions. Such influence is encouraged to be explored."
