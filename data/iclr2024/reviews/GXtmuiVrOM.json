Specifically, instead of maximizing the expected total return over the distribution of the dynamics parameters, this paper proposes a constrained optimization problem that directly maximizes the entropy of the dynamics distribution subject to a constraint on the success probability.  Based on this formulation, this paper proceeds to offer an algorithmic implementation that decouples this maximization into two subroutines: (1) Update the policy by any off-the-shelf RL algorithm under the current dynamics parameter; (2) Under the current policy, update the dynamics parameter to improve the entropy with the help of a KL-based trust region. Accordingly, a toy experiment is provided to demonstrate the dynamics distribution that DORAEMON converges to. The proposed algorithm is then evaluated on both sim-to-sim (MuJoCo) and sim-to-real tasks (PandaPush) against multiple baseline DR methods."

                "value": "Overall I could appreciate the proposed reformulation of DR, but there are some concerns regarding the algorithm:\n\n- DORAEMON appears to be conceptually very similar to the AutoDR, or ADR in the original paper (Akkaya et al., 2019). They both define some custom indicators of success and iteratively increase the entropy of the dynamics distribution. With that said, DORAEMON appears to be yet a somewhat different implementation of the idea highlighted by ADR.\n\n- Based on the above, while the two approaches arise from similar ideas, DORAEMON appears to have a better success rate across almost all environments. It is not immediately clear whether the performance improvement comes from which specific part of the design or it is just a matter of different choices of hyperparameters. While there is a one-sentence discussion on the authors\u2019 conjecture in Section 5.2 (about the potential data inefficiency), it is expected to have a deeper dive into the root cause of this performance difference.\n\n- The successful rate for certain tasks, e.g., Walker in Figure 2 and PandaPush in Figure 11, decline after reaching maximum entropy. However, the algorithm does not dynamically reduce the entropy in response to a decrease in the success rate, which might be necessary for maintaining performance consistency. This appears not consistent with the objective in (4). As the discussion in Section 5.2 does not fully address this phenomenon, more explanation would be needed.\n\n- Another concern lies in the constraint based on the success rate. Specifically, the use of success rate largely ignores the effect of the poor trajectories, which could be arbitrarily poor and degrade the robustness of the learned policy. By contrast, in the standard DR, the objective is to consider the expected total return over all the possible trajectories. As the experimental results reported in the paper all focus on the \u201csuccess rate\u201d, the robustness issue is thereby largely neglected."

The constrained problem does not seem to be convex (even under Beta distribution)?\n\n- Could the authors specify the alpha values for Figure 2 and Figure 11? When the entropy matches the max entropy, the global success rate aligns with the local success rate. If the alpha is set to 0.5, why does the global success rate drop below 0.5 when entropy is at its maximum?\n\n- How to design the entropy jointly for multiple dynamics parameters? (For example, simply taking the product of multiple univariate distributions like AutoDR?)\n\n- In Section 3: The notation of reward function shall be consistent (mathcal or not)\n\n------------------ Post-rebuttal ------------------\n\nI would like to thank the authors for the detailed response. Most of my questions have been addressed, especially the ablation study.

The effectiveness of DR, however, largely depends on the chosen sampling distribution for these parameters.

This paper introduces a new method for enhancing sim-to-real transfer, dubbed DOmain RAndomization via Entropy MaximizatiON (DORAEMON). DORAEMON is a constrained optimization framework that aims to maximize the entropy of the training distribution while also maintaining the agent's ability to generalize. It accomplishes this by incrementally expanding the range of dynamic parameters used for training, provided that the current policy maintains a high likelihood of success. Experiments show that DORAEMON outperforms several DR benchmarks in terms of generalization and showcase application in a robotics manipulation task with previously unseen real-world dynamics."

DORAEMON strategically increases the entropy of training distributions, conditioned on achieving a probability of success threshold and by ensuring updates to the entropy are constrained. The aim is to balance both the entropy of the dynamics parameters distribution and task proficiency. Empirical tests across OpenAI Gym benchmarks and on a real-world robotic task highlight DORAEMON's superior adaptability to diverse dynamic settings compared to conventional domain randomization approaches and also demonstrate how the success rate threshold and success definition (i.e., lower bound return threshold) impact performance. This work convincingly demonstrates the potential benefit of applying DORAEMON to systems where sim-to-real policy transfer is important."

This method is an advancement in the field of RL, not only in the scope of domain randomization but potentially in areas of research outside of domain randomization (e.g., meta-RL). The method's innovation stems from its entropy maximization technique that enables a policy to generalize across a broader range of dynamics, while ensuring that the entropy of the dynamics parameter distribution grows in a manner that does not compromise the policy's probability of success. \n\nQuality\nThe proposed algorithm, DORAEMON, has been tested in OpenAI Gym benchmarks and in a sim-to-real robotics task, generally demonstrating its superior generalization in comparison to existing domain randomization techniques. \n\nClarity\nThe paper has a clear definition of success and the presentation of the results are well-structured. The mathematics foundations of the paper are clear and sound. The figures and empirical results support the authors claims of the superiority of their method in comparison to traditional domain randomization methods.\n\nSignificance\nThis paper is significant to the development of autonomous systems and has the potential for real-world application in industry.\n\nSummary\nDORAEMON stands out as an original, high-quality research work with significant implications for both theory and application in reinforcement learning and robotics."

However, there may be a need for more diverse environmental tests to fully understand the limits of DORAEMON's generalization ability. For instance, testing in environments with higher-dimensional state spaces or more complex dynamics could provide a more comprehensive picture of the algorithm's robustness.\n\nThe research presented is certainly complex and holds significant value to the field. However, some sections of the text may benefit from further clarification to enhance the paper's accessibility to a broader audience. In particular, the density of technical terms and concepts could be balanced with more detailed explanations or simplified language. This could potentially include adding definitions, or providing more background information for non-expert readers. Such revisions would likely make the paper's contributions even more impactful and ensure that a wider range of readers can fully grasp the innovative work you have presented."
