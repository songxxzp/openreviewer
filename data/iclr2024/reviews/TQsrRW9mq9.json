                "value": "### Method\n\n1: **Forcing the correlation score of unique embeddings to be zero is not convincing.** As shown in Figure 2 and the methodology, the DeCUR splits the original output embedding into common and unique parts for each modality. The similarities of paried unique parts between modalities are **required to be zero**, while they **belong to the same instance** across different modalities. In other words, it means partial features of an instance from two modalities need to be mutually exclusive. Why can such training objectives make the model learn meaningful features? Could the authors provide further explanations? In the overall training loss, the common parts are trained to be aligned. So, will only the shared common features contribute to the representation ability, and will the unique parts be trained to be a trivial solution and meaningless?\n\n### Experiments\n\n1: **Missing comparisons for the main results.** In the introduction, the authors show the benefits of Barlow twins, like the fact that they don't need a large batchsize. A similar work, Mocov2 [1] (released in 2020), performs contrastive learning for self-supervised learning while reducing the necessity of a large batch size, which can also be included for comparison. In Table 2, the authors didn't compare the CLIP with the RGB-only scenario.\n\n2: **Missing ablation studies of the effect of the common and unique features.** The decoupling is one of the main contributions in this work, while the analysis of the independent effects of the common and unique features is missed in the experiments part. What will the performance be if we only use the common or unique features for downstream tasks?\n\n### Analysis\n\n1: **The T-SNE visualizations.** In Figure 1, the common features of all the modalities are the same color and shape, which makes it hard for me to judge whether the common parts are well aligned (the authors only show one case using an enlarged circle).\n\n 2: **The Cross-modal representation alignment analysis isn't convincing.** The authors calculate the correlation score of every corresponding dimension across two modalities' embeddings to illustrate the effect of feature decoupling. In other words, the authors judge the methods based on the assumption that the i-th dimension of modality A's embedding is paired with the i-th dimension of modality B's embedding. However, there is no guarantee that such an assumption is established since the alignment performs at the image-level rather than the channel-level.\n\n\nOverall, the decoupling module isn't technically sound to me, and the experiments with analysis also aren't convincing. Therefore, I vote for rejection at this time.\n\n[1] Chen, Xinlei, et al. \"Improved baselines with momentum contrastive learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.04297 (2020)."

In a lot of multimodal scenarios, modality can be unbalanced -- some modality contain more common features while others contain less. I wonder if it makes more sense to set different percentage to different modalities. Another problem related to this is that the proposed approach seems to require grid search of this ratio to get the best performance. I assume that by changing the percentage of common dimension, retraining of the whole model is needed? This results in computational burdens, and stand as a disadvantage. \n\n+ I wonder if the discovered modality-common and unique features can be utilized in some multimodal robustness settings, besides visualization. Say if one of the modality gets perturbed by Gaussian noise / there is a certain probability that one of the modality is missing during inference time, I expect the learned common features would be beneficial in this scenario while modality unique features from the perturbed modality would diminish the performance. \n\n+ The datasets used for experiments, while being multimodal, are essentially all image modalities. Could the authors comment briefly about the applicability of the proposed approach to other modalities (say audio, text)?"
