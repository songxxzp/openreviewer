Regarding the Assumption in Theorem 4.1: The paper assumes that the probability of having left and right children does not depend on the state because the pruning decision depends on the global upper bound instead of the parent node. However, the global upper bound can change dynamically during the search, which might influence the probability. Does this paper use optimal solutions as upper bounds? Could the authors provide further clarification on this assumption?\n    \n2. Exploring Limited Generalization Ability: In comparing the results presented in Table 5 and Table 3, it is observed that TreeDQN appears to exhibit less stability in the context of transfer tasks. Could you please offer insights or explanations regarding this phenomenon?\n    \n3. A Traditional vs. RL-based Variable Selection Perspective: Traditional variable selection methods rely on human-designed criteria, such as pseudocosts. One advantage of these traditional approach is its applicability to various problem types. On the other hand, current RL-based methods require training an optimal policy for each specific problem. Given the noted limitations in generalization ability, RL methods seem to necessitate training on problem instances of a similar size as the target problems. Could you provide any comments or insights on the potential implications of this limitation? (This question is optional, and your input is welcomed purely out of curiosity.)"

The authors assert that this (as well as more intricate node selection policies) lead to at most a moderate distribution shift, but never demonstrate this effect.\n2. Another concern is regarding the difficulty distribution of instances. Random instance generation has been known to generate significant amounts of trivial instances compared to real-world equivalents. However, this is a limitation of most prior work on learnt variable selection rules as well.\n3. TreeDQN is also more expensive in terms of wall-clock-time than prior work (especially the IL agent), which can be seen in Figure 4. The paper does not make it clear whether this is due to TreeDQN using a different architecture, or TreeDQN simply creating more expensive nodes during branching.\n4. An important missing baseline in their comparisons is out-of-the-box SCIP, acting as an automatic state-of-the-art hand-crafted tradeoff between SB and cheaper heuristics.\n\n\nThe paper needs an extensive re-write in terms of argumentation and clarity.\n\n\nSome more points:\n- Abstract: BnB solver[s] split a task\u2026\n- Abstract: \u2026the Bellman operator adapted for the tree MDP is contracting in mean\u2026 - initially I did not understand what you mean with that (only at some later point into the paper)\n- Intro: with [the] Branch-and-Bound algorithm (B&B). |[The] B&B algorithm employs\u2026\n- \u201cThe variable selection process is the most computationally expensive and crucial for the performance of the whole algorithm\u201d \u2013 is there a reference to prove this?

It more or less assumes familiarity with the Tree MDP work of Scavuzzo et al., and a more self-contained exposition would be very helpful.\n\nThe theoretical contribution is very hazy to me. Contraction in mean is not really well-motivated. Does the cited theorem (Jaakkola \u201893) apply to the setting of tree operators here? That seems like a nontrivial assumption that is missing justification. Rather than just including a theorem about contraction in mean, the authors should have a main theorem that states the actual convergence guarantee that follows.\n\nMy understanding is that this paper is methodologically very similar to Scavuzzo et al., and only differs in the mechanics of how the RL algorithm is trained. This is discussed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. In Section 4.2, the main difference is that the authors use a loss function that appears to be selectively picked based on the objective of minimizing the geometric mean of the tree sizes during training/testing. This to me feels like a specific and brittle design choice.\n\nThe new method is shown to yield smaller branch-and-bound trees than previous RL based variable selection policies, but no comparison is made to the default settings of any state-of-the-art solver (e.g., Gurobi, CPLEX, SCIP). This is an important comparison that should be included.\n\nOverall the presentation did not convince me that this is a sufficiently novel contribution for ICLR. It seems like the authors just slightly tweaked some aspects of the methodology of Scavuzzo et al. It\u2019s great that these modifications work and yield promising experimental results, but I just did not find the current writeup to be a sufficiently original contribution. The writeup itself also needs quite a bit of work to make it a cohesive, readable, and self-contained (the theory is presented in a very ad-hoc manner without formal definitions) contribution."

The main contribution of the paper, TreeDQN, is explained in a single paragraph in the main text. Since the text only states that the algorithms is an adaptation of Double Dueling DQN, I assume TreeDQN is a straightforward adaption of DQN to Tree MDPs.\n\nThe paper builds on a couple of previous papers, which I had to skim over in order to understand the present paper. I am not entirely familiar with the line of work of using RL to learn how to branch and I can tell that the paper wasn't written for me. These are the two papers that helped me understand this submission:\n\nExact Combinatorial Optimization with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks \nand\nLearning to Branch with Tree MDPs\n\nThe example on Mixed Integer Linear Programming isn't very helpful. The tree shown in Figure 1 is uninformative; it simply shows nodes in a tree where the color scheme differs the root of the inner nodes and from some of the leaf nodes. It would have been more helpful to not show a tree and give the reader a full example on how the branch and bound search works. I asked ChatGPT for an example and it gave me an example (without any drawings, of course) that was more helpful than the tree example shown in the paper. \n\nOverall the background section could be re-written to use less space and pack more information to help the reader understand the work.\n\nI cannot understand the last paragraph of Section 2.2 without reading the paper by Scavuzzo et al. (2022). Here are the question I asked myself while reading that paragraph. \n\n1. Why do we need to use DFS as node selection or set the global upper bound in the root to the optimal solution cost to guarantee the Markov property? \n2. The gap between training and testing is due to assuming that one has the optimal solution in training? Why not use DFS and not assume that you have the optimal solution in training? \n3. How can more efficient heuristics for node selection also induce a gap between training and testing? And why is this important? \n\nSection 4 lists properties of a successful RL method for this problem, which includes off-policy and \"work with tree MDP instead of temporal MDP\". Why is it important to learn off-policy? We know of many successful on-policy algorithms for RL, what am I missing here? Why do they have to work with tree MDPs? \n\nThe empirical setting is described in previous papers and the current paper relies on that. How is the training data generated? Do the problems differ in difficulty? Do we have to optimally solve the problem to attain the Markov property to then train the model? If so, how are the problems solved? Assuming that the training instances are easy (one needs to solve them optimally), how does the learned heuristic scale to larger problems? \n\nThe number of seeds also seems to be small (5), for the kind of learning being done. \n\nOverall, it seems that the paper has some interesting ideas, but I don't fully understand them. The paper was written for people who already knows the details of this line of work, and it isn't friendly to newcomers to the point that the paper isn't self contained."
