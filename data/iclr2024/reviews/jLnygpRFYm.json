Experimental results demonstrate that using StoP reduces overfitting to location features and guides the model toward learning features that are more robust to location uncertainty, which also leads to better performance on a variety of downstream tasks."

                "value": "- I am a bit confused on step 11 in Algorithm 1. As in Figure 2, the context and masked representations are computed by adding their tokens and positional embeddings together. Then for step 11, I suppose $\\psi_{B_x}$ should refer to the positional embedding, and $A s_x+b$ should refer to context token? Why do we need an additional linear transformation on $s_x$? Some explanations may be needed for this part. \n- Based on the above concern, I am also confused by later explanations in section 3.2 and 4.3, The authors seem to let $s_{x_i}$ (resp. $n_j$) as context (resp. masked) tokens, and $b$ (resp. $\\tilde{m}$) corresponds to the bias for context (resp. masked) tokens. However, I suppose $n_j$ should simply be used to compute stochastic positional embedding as in (2), and $s_{x_i}$ is computed from encoder $f_\\theta$ to encode context information. How can they have the same role? \n- Moreover, with the above correspondence, we should have $A s_x+b$ (resp. $An+\\tilde{m}$) as context (resp.) tokens, then the positional embedding is simply $\\psi_{B_x}$ (resp. $\\psi_{B_y}$), and where is the stochasticity? I suppose there might be some misunderstanding. \n- I would also like to see more discussions on the connection between StoP and vanilla MIM. I suppose we can replace step 10 with $\\tilde{m} + \\psi_{B_y}$, and step 11 with $s_x+\\psi_{B_x}$ to reduce to vanilla MIM, is it correct? Such discussions may make it easier to understand the proposed method. \n- While the authors have mentioned the necessity of regularization on A, the regularization with context token is a bit confusing. I note that the authors have conducted additional experiments in section 4.3 that uses L1 regularization on A. Nevertheless, L1 regularization should aim to obtain a sparse matrix A, which seems to contradict with the original aim to avoid zero A. The authors may consider using some other regularization (and also remove A in computing context tokens) and see how such modification works compared to Algorithm 1. \n\nMinor: the authors may also need to pay more attention on notations and typos. An example is on the top of page 5 \u201cContext Encoding\u201d, \u201cWhere\u201d is wrongly capitalized (in fact the capitalization is used very arbitrarily and may require a careful proof-reading). Also, the notation through this paper is not consistent, especially for representations $c$ and $m$. Some revisions may be needed as well."

What is the benefits of introducing additional degree of freedom here to learn Sigma? What if we fix Sigma without learning? Isn't it a simpler way to avoid degeneracy of matrix A?  Please explain the motivation. \n\nW2: I understand that adding stochastic perturbation to position of the images makes sense in regularizing the model. However, why the same spectral decomposition is applied to features s_x (by multiplying with A)? This step also lacks motivation and seems to be heuristic, please clarify on this point, \n\nW3: What exactly architecture did the paper use to parameterize the matrix $\\Sigma$ ? An architecture flow illustration will help better illustrate this mechanism. Currently, I am not sure how the back-propagation of $\\Sigma$ flows back to the network  (figure 1 does not have this part ) and how it affects the SSL learning with a positive gain. \n\nW4: I am not sure of the significance of proposition 1.
