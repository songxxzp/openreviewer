You are assuming causal knowledge which is perhaps the strongest prior impractical knowledge there is? But before that you say that modelling the non-stationarity (NS) is impractical because of the strong prior knowledge required.\n- Seems like a misnomer to say that we are seeking to 'tackle NS' - surely you are wanting to model it, not treat it like a phenomena that needs to be overcome.\n\n### Introduction\n\n- [second paragraph] It is more correct to say that learning a causal graph from observations in an NS environment is difficult (normal causal discovery is exceptionally difficult in and off itself) because of the inherent distribution shift. This does not necessarily mean that the DAG itself is changing it could be a mechanism drift that is causing the change in dynamics and hence NS. You should explain this.\n- I am not entirely sure that you need the last two paragraphs of this section because the information is so dense and specialised, it is okay for the reader to just wait for the main exposition of the method, rather than have you summarise it here in the introduction. I.e. I do not think it adds a lot.\n\n### Methodology\n\n- I do not follow how your method accounts for NS in the mechanism rather than NS in the topology. You are learning a graph topology to model the NS. But the mechanism (the functions, edges, of that DAG) may be generating the concept drift (NS). Consider that in a causal setting, non-stationarity can arise from both changing DAG topology and changing mechanisms within a static DAG topology:\n1. **Changing DAG Topology**:\n   Non-stationarity can occur when the causal relationships represented by the DAG change over time. For example, in a dynamic causal system, the underlying structure of causal relationships may evolve. This means that the set of variables and their connections, as represented by the DAG, can change. This situation is common in dynamic systems where, for instance, new causal pathways emerge, or existing ones disappear over time. Detecting and modeling these changes in the DAG topology is essential for understanding causality in a dynamic environment.\n\n2. **Changing Mechanisms within a Static DAG Topology**:\n   Even within a static DAG topology, non-stationarity can manifest if the mechanisms governing the relationships between variables change over time. This means that the functional forms or conditional dependencies between variables may vary under different conditions or time periods. For example, a medical treatment may have different causal effects on patients of different ages or genders. In this case, the underlying DAG structure remains the same, but the mechanisms, such as the strength of causal connections, can change.\n\n-  Please comment on how your interacts with this setting.\n- You assume that there are $K$ distinct stationary environments but $K$ is not upper-bounded. So if $K\\rightarrow +\\infty$ what happens then?\n\n### Experiments\n\n- [first sentence] Again you are treating NS as adversary rather than something to be modelled. The phrasing seems a bit odd given that you seek a model which can model the NS not remove it.\n- Relating back to your abstract, you make the claim that \"most existing methods attempt to model changes in the environment explicitly, often requiring impractical prior knowledge\" (second sentence). You have not conducted any experiments which actually address that claim but have instead provided (impressive) results which compare your method to other SoTA methods. My main concern with this paper is that I simply do not believe that what you have proposed is in fact _more practical_ than having prior knowledge (as is your claim). \n\n### Related work\n\n- Excellent section. Very comprehensive."

                "value": "The paper addresses non-stationarity in reinforcement learning, highlighting its amplification through causal relationships during state transitions. Instead of directly modeling environmental changes, the authors introduce the Causal-Origin REPresentation (COREP) algorithm. COREP uses a guided updating mechanism to create a stable state representation, making policies more resilient to non-stationarity. Experimental results support COREP's effectiveness over existing methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. This paper integrates three different techniques but the underlying motivation is unclear.\n\n- The choice of GNNs (specifically GAT) for representing causal graphs necessitates a stronger justification, given that causality inherently relies on the structure of directed acyclic graphs.\n\n- Similarly, the adoption of causal-origin representation within the reinforcement learning framework also needs more justifications.\n\n2. One of my biggest concerns lies in the theoretical analysis. As the paper is concerned with the non-stationary RL, the performance guarantees, i.e., regret bound and convergence rate, are not studied at all. \n\n3. Another biggest concern is that the novelty and contribution of this work are not significant. The GAT, causal discovery, and non-stationary RL are well studied in many existing literature. The paper does not provide significantly novel methodological or theoretical techniques in the current stage.\n\n4. The mixing of varying components for policy optimization makes the algorithm difficult to train. I am concerned about the efficiency and complexity of the proposed method, especially compared to the existing baselines (in terms of model complexity, computation, and sample efficiency).\n\n5. The total loss contains multiple tuning parameters (>3), how to efficiently tune these parameters, and what's the sensitivity of the model performance concerning these parameters? The authors only present some preliminary sensitivity analyses on tasks such as cartpole swingup, it is insufficient to demonstrate the robustness of these parameters. \n\n6. The training procedure is not fully disclosed. The authors need to provide specific learning rates, initial values set up, parameter-tuning details, and values for each task. \n\n7. The experimental design to emulate non-stationarity is somewhat naive and may not encapsulate the variety and complexity of non-stationarities encountered in practical settings. The algorithm's efficacy under more typical real-world conditions remains unverified, thus limiting the potential impact of the work. \n\n8. The presentation of this paper needs significant improvement. And I highly recommend the authors do more proofreading. In particular:\n\n- The format of notations is not standard in RL, causal inference, or GNN literature, which puts additional burdens on readers to understand. \n\n- The logical flow of the paper is not clear, and the central claim is vague. \n\n- There exist many typos and errors, like the repeated authors' names (redundant citations) in the section of related works."
