                "value": "**W1. The motivations of some statements and designs are unclear.**\n\nIn Section 1, why the fact that 'FLP is sensitive to non-architectural hyperparameters' can begs a question regarding DNC, i.e., 'in analogy to the dynamic node classification task, is there a temporal link classification task we can define?' From my perspective, the relationships between FLP and RLC are also not fully discussed. At the very beginning of the paper, it is highly recommended to add a toy running example (e.g., a simple dynamic graph) to illustrate what are FLP, DNC, and RLC, as well as their inherent relationships.\n  \nIn the design of profile encoder, what are the motivations to introduce metapaths? As I known, metapaths are usually used in the graph representation learning of heterogeneous graphs, but it seems that the authors only consider (dynamic) homogeneous graphs in this study. Moreover, metapaths are also not illustrated in Fig. 1 (i.e., the model architecture).\n  \nThere are no intuitive motivations regarding the proposed metrics of edge homophily and Matthews correlation coefficient (e.g., why Matthews correlation coefficient can handle the label-imbalanced issue). As a results, it is unclear what are their advantages beyond conventional quality metrics.\n  \n***\n  \n**W2. The problem statements in Section 3 are unclear and even confusing. Some presentation and statements seem to be inconsistent.**\n  \nIn the 1st paragraph of Section 3, the availability of graph attributes (e.g., inputs of node and edge features) are not mentioned. However, as stated in the 2nd paragraph, edges attributes are treated as inputs of RLC. It is unclear that whether graph attributes (in terms of node attributes/features or edge attributes/features) are considered in this paper. If so, are they assumed to be static (for all time steps) or they are also dynamic?\n  \nAt the very beginning of Section 3, it is suggested to highlight which data model (i.e., discrete-time dynamic graph or continuous-time dynamic graph) that the authors adopted in this paper.\n  \nThe formal definitions of FLP and DNC are not given. For both FLP and DNC, there are transductive and inductive settings. The formal definitions regarding the transductive and inductive of RLC are not given. It is also unclear that the authors only consider the transductive setting or both transductive and inductive settings.\n\n'Profile' is a significant concept in the proposed method, e.g., profile encoder, node profile, etc. However, there seems no definition regarding this concept (e.g., what are profiles in real dynamic graphs and in terms of what).\n\nAccording to the statements in Section 3, each edge in a (dynamic) graphs should be associated with a time step. However, the graphs in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 seem to be static. Furthermore, edge attributes are also not illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.\n\n***\n\n**W3. Experiments are too simple. Some details regarding experiment settings are also unclear.**\n\nIn experiments, there are only two baseline methods (i.e., TGN and GraphMixer), which cannot fully validate the superiority of the proposed method. In addition to the two baselines, there are also some other dynamic graph representation learning methods (e.g., TGAT, DySAT, EvolveGCN, etc.) as mentioned in Section 2 that can be included in experiments. Experiment results of GraphMixer are not given in Table 3, Fig. 4, etc. In Table 1, the number of timesteps and the number of classed are not given for each dataset. The quality metric w.r.t. the results in Table 3 is not mentioned in the caption.  \n\n***\n\n**W4. The major contributions of this paper are unclear and not fully verified.**\n  \nAlthough the authors claimed that they proposed a new temporal graph learning task (i.e., RLC) and new quality metrics (i.e., edge homophily and MCR), their advantages beyond existing techniques (e.g., what are the advantages of treating RLC as a new temporal graph learning task beyond FLP and DNC) are not fully discussed in the paper and not fully validated in experiments, due to the unclear motivations and insufficient experiments.\n\n***\n\n**W5. The overall presentation is poor. In addition to the inconsistent presentation mentioned before, there are also some grammatical errors and typos that need careful revisions.**\n\n1) 'analyze the temporal graph learning architectures divindign categorizing the methods literature into two groups'\n\n2) 'edges$\\mathcal{E}$'\n\n3) 'we construct derived graphs that'\n\n4) 'connect a vertex acting that acts as a source to another that acts as a course through a shared destination vertex'\n\n5) 'on abuse-like like datasets'"

                "value": "The paper introduces the \"Recent Link Classification\" task within the field of \"Temporal Graph Learning,\" focusing on categorizing existing links based on source and destination entities. The authors evaluate baseline methods for future link prediction and temporal graph learning in recent link classification, employing the Mathews Correlation Coefficient as the evaluation metric. Their proposed Graph Profiler architecture consists of five components: profile encoder, message encoder, destination encoder, and a readout layer for information aggregation. The study delves into various strategies for the profile encoder, time encoder, and readout layer, demonstrating performance enhancements over baseline methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The modeling decisions, such as the choice between learnable or fixed time encoding, appear ad-hoc and contingent on specific datasets. It would be beneficial to elucidate insights or provide general guidance for determining an optimal combination on new datasets. For instance, what factors contribute to the observed performance variation, and is there a rationale for the less effective performance of learnable time-encoding on the Wikipedia dataset?\n2. Given that the src-dst-msg-t configuration doesn't generally yield the best results, I am wondering about the necessity of introducing seemingly redundant components like the destination encoder. Additionally, the observed performance degradation in cases where time encoding is added to src-dst raises questions. Is there any explanation for that?\n3. The presented task bears similarities to entity relationship classification in NLP. It would be interesting to discuss the similarities and differences between these two tasks.\n4. The proposed method mainly combines several existing methods together, which makes the technical contribution of method design not very high.\n\n\nMinor comment:\n1. The paper contains several typos, and certain sentences are challenging to comprehend.\n2. The captions in the graph are too small to read."
