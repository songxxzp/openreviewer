The authors claim that repeated sampling of random subsets (RS2), that is, only randomly sample subsets at each round, can be a powerful baseline strategy. RS2 is competitive against most of the sampling strategies as well as dataset distillation methods developed previously. Besides, there is no additional computation cost extracting the coreset using RS2, so RS2 reaches the best acceleration under the same sample budget."

For the cases where RS2 achieves the same accuracy in significantly less amount of time, I think the main issue was not tuning the epoch/learning rate hyperparameter of the full dataset baseline. Therefore making the RS2 w/o replacement results less exciting. \n\n- Can authors provide a plot #unique examples seen throughout training? It could be the case that certain baselines are not exploring the full dataset, due to possibly inadequate hyperparameter search on them. \n\n- I am very confused about Table 1, where we allow the model to update the subset after every round. I request authors provide a clear description for every baseline for both cases, where the distribution is allowed to change over time. The notion of RC and RS has to be made clear for each of the baselines. \n\n- Why is RC's performance extremely worse in certain baselines such as GraNd? In general, why is there a strong dip in the performance of all the baselines, when switched to RC? \n\n- For the baselines that sample set based on submodular function, what does it mean to have a distribution? How are authors defining the distribution over each set of size \"k\"? If that is the case, how are they sampling? If not, what is the heuristic?\n\n- I think it is not correct to compare active learning baselines to subset selection schemes that look at  - (1) all the dataset, but the reduced number of iterations, and (2) assume labels for all the data points, since AL does not assume labels. \n\n- Each of these baseline papers has comparisons against random, on the other hand here the authors break the baselines by mere random selection. What is the reason for this discrepancy?  \n\n- Can authors please point to the hyperparameter tuning for each of the baselines? Submodular functions often work well if tuned properly, therefore it is important to see if enough hyperparameter tuning was done to make sure the function is good. \n\n- For the submodular methods if the corresponding greedy gain was used to sample sets (distribution defined using gains), it should be noted that if the function saturates, then greedy gains do not\u00a0provide any useful information (yet another reason to provide hyperparameter search grids). \n\n\nI am willing to raise scores upon satisfactory responses to my questions."

This is not discussed anywhere but brings into question the whole exposition of proposing RS2 as a sampling method.  An even simpler baseline is training as usual on the full dataset with the condensed schedule.

                "value": "This work empirically investigated a strong baseline called Repeated Sampling of Random Subsets (RSRS, or RS2), in the context of dataset pruning/distillation. The authors found that this sampling scheme, which has been overlooked by the literature, served as a very strong baseline in terms of many metrics, such as end model accuracy and *time-to-accuracy*.\n\nThe authors did intensive experiments that compare RS2 with up to 24 existing dataset pruning/distillation methods and observed the superiority of RS2 under all of the above metrics. The authors called for attention from the community on this strong but overlooked baseline."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The RS2 without replacement is exactly the same as reducing the number of training epochs but with tuned learning rate scheduling. The new term is not helping to make the concept clear but more confusing. This also means that the theoretical analysis in Section 4 did not make actual contributions over previous work.\n\n- In my opinion, a type of dataset pruning methods, which generate static subsets before real training starts, are up to a slightly different point from RS2. While we all know that the more data used for training the better, these methods try to find a coreset that is essential for good generalization. Therefore, it is important that the pruned data are not seen during the training process later (thus static subset). This reduces the storage cost which is not possible with RS2 because RS2 still requires access to the full training set.\n\n- RS2 with replacement has been adopted in a few more works in the context of efficient training like [Ref-1, Ref-2].\n\n------------------\n\nRefs:\n\n[Ref-1] Wang, Yue, et al. \"E2-train: Training state-of-the-art cnns with over 80% energy savings.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 32 (2019).\n\n[Ref-2] Wu, Yawen, et al. \"Enabling on-device cnn training by self-supervised instance filtering and error map pruning.\" IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems 39.11 (2020): 3445-3457."
