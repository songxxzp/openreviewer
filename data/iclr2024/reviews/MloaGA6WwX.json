Throughout optimization, channels are dropped at regular intervals based on the score-network's average output for these channels.\nExperiments on several datasets are then conducted to show the efficiency of the approach."

This way, the task network is optimized for the same number of steps and in the same manner, i.e. with gradually less channels. Maybe this gradual aspect is actually making the reconstruction network better and it's why TADRED is performing better. I list this as a weakness and not as a question, because to me the experiments are lacking of proof that the score network is working as intended and not just a smart preprocessor or anything else.\n- **Experiments**: my current problem with the experimental section is that I see it in 2 folds: qMRI/EOS where TADRED outperforms state-of-the-art | others where TADRED outperforms baselines. In the others setting, I gather that there was no previous interest reported in the literature for solving the task with ED (i.e. no published results to compare against). For qMRI/EOS, I have an issue because it seems that these 2 tasks have not gathered a lot of interest either if we simply look at the citation count for the papers introducing the challenges (17 for MUDI and 5 for EOS).\n\nThis last reason is why I am not increasing my score at the moment."

Each time it reduces the feature/channel set it solves an optimization problem (3) that simultaneously trains a network to solve a task, designs a binary mask (optimized as continuous numbers) that subsamples the remaining channels, and learns a weighting matrix that weights the remaining channels fed into the network.
