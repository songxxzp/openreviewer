This paper differs in that the authors attempt to provide a methodology and a dataset to evaluate the faithfulness of the explanations, which could be a meaningful contribution if executed well.\n\n2. If the authors' assumption that the model is indeed using the rule holds true (which I am skeptical about, see W1 and Q3); the remainder of the evaluations become interesting. In that, if we can verify that a model is using a rule, we can use consistency tests to understand whether LLMs\u2019 explanations are faithful to their decision-making processes; and this would be a useful methodology."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The connection between an explanation and hypothesizing that the model uses a rule is extremely brittle, in my opinion. I will state my understanding here, and please correct me if I am wrong. \n- The authors suggest that if a model attains high accuracy in a task, and is robust to adversarial perturbations, then the model is using a rule. \n- The above is too strong of an assumption, and `Therefore the goal is to test if the model is as close as feasible to using the known rule` jump the authors make is too strong. A model can exploit another rule, that is also invariant to the perturbation distribution chosen by the authors, yet is different than the ground truth rule.\n- To their justice, the authors themselves also recognize this, `could be using the more complex rule \u201ccontains the word \u2018lizard\u2019 or \u2018zyrpluk\u201d` and I certainly agree \u2013 the behavioral results need not imply that a model is using a rule. This strong assumption makes the remainder of the results more brittle, in my view.\n- Overall, I believe the verification of this strong assumption should extend beyond having a handful of perturbations to the existing prompts and needs more justification. This constitutes the most significant limitation in the paper, since if the assumption does not hold the paper\u2019s methodology becomes invalidated.\n\n2. The freeform articulation test appears brittle to me. Even though an articulation does not match the ground truth rule designed in the test, if the articulated rule could also explain the same set of examples, then it would not be correct to label this as an inaccuracy, in my opinion. There may be multiple correct strategies, and the model may be using it. This comment is related to W2. \n\n3. The above two weaknesses are also made more brittle by the low sample size ($<256$). This also makes the finetuning results somewhat brittle \u2013 authors finetune models with billions of parameters with tens of examples, and this alone may contribute to why finetuning does not improve articulation accuracy."

                "value": "1. In Section 2.2, description of the task, authors say `5 space-separated lower case words`, yet Figure 2 contains 3 words, although the appendix includes 5-word examples. If 5 words are used across the board, I would either fix Figure 2 or add a disclaimer to avoid confusion.\n\n2. Section 2 immediately jumps to defining tasks, but until reading the rest of the paper I could not understand what these tasks are for (for explanations? For measuring model accuracy? For both?). I would add a short paragraph to the start of Section 2 to clarify what we are defining in the coming tasks.\n\n3. I would be curious to see whether the articulated explanations that are labeled as incorrect could also explain the provided examples. Specifically, what fraction of the ~30% of freeform evaluations provided by GPT-4 that are not aligned with the ground truth rule could also explain the provided in-context examples? This could be an easy test that could be evaluated by another LLM in the loop (give the articulation, and ask whether it could explain the in-context example). Alternatively, this could also be evaluated by hand since it will be a few tens of examples.\n\nMinor\n\n1. (Intro, Paragraph 1) I\u2019m not sure what AGI Alignment means in this specific context, personally I believe if we use such desiderata for systems in scientific papers, we at least need to define what it is.\n\n2. (Intro, Last Paragraph) authors cite: `as well as GPT-4 (Bubeck et al., 2023)`; but Bubeck et al. hardly is the paper that introduced GPT-4. I\u2019d cite the technical report by OpenAI, since the model was released by them, not by Bubeck et al."

More details on why the models fail would strengthen the paper.\t\t\n\t- While the selected definition of self-explain is interesting, the paper ignores feature attribution methods. However, attribution maps and their correlation with the LMs output would further support the insights.\n\t- Authors decided to introduce their test bed by evaluating black-box LMs. However, models with white box access (e.g., Pythia [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01373]) or Llama would provide more insights, e.g., by investigating input attribution. But even with only black-box access, input feature attribution can be generated, e.g., using perturbation methods or Contrastive Input Erasure [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10419.pdf]. Further open LMs would provide greater reproducibility.\n- Tables and figures exceed the paper margins\t\n\n- The paper states, \"We evaluate to what extent LLMs are capable of producing faithful explanations of their own behavior via finetuning.\" However, the faithfulness of the explanation is largely ignored in the present evaluation. See e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03429.pdf.\n\nMinor Comments:\n- Sec 2.2.1 seems to be the only subsection of 2.2. It also seems to be misplaced. It rather fits the 2.4. Same for 2.1. In Section 2, the authors could distinguish between the test-bed, including the tasks, and the dataset.\n- \"Curie showed the first signs of life.\" Try to avoid such phrases.\n- Remove figure references in the description of the main finding in the introduction since they interrupt the reading flow. Place Figure 2 as the first figure since it summarizes the methodology of the paper quite well and is more helpful than Figure 1 at the beginning of the paper. Current Figure 1 should be placed in the results.\n- Captions should be left aligned"

As you briefly discuss in the limitation section, if a model can self-explain itself as the present paper defines it, it is still unclear if these explanations are faithful, i.e., corresponding to the reasons used in the model's internal process. Same for the opposite case. If it can not self-explain as defined in the paper, it does not prove that it is actually not using the right reasons. It would be interesting to see a relation between, e.g., the quality of feature attribution-based explanations and the investigated self-explain capabilities of a model."

Simply comparing model sizes does not account for these other variables that likely also impact articulation accuracy.\n3. The ArticulateRules dataset is relatively small and simple, focusing on text classification tasks based on simple syntactic rules.
