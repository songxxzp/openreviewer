                "value": "The paper proposes incremental predictive coding. At a high level, predictive coding is the idea that one way to see brain function is that there is a top down generative model whose parameters are updated based on discrepancy between model output and stimulus received from the environment. More specifically, this paper talks about a specific generative model: a hierarchical Gaussian generative model where the means are passed thru non-linear functions from layer to layer of a generative neural network, with the covariance held fixed at identity. The optimal solution to the generative model (given data) is of course intractable and the next best is the standard expectation maximization update algorithm. The authors point out that this is generally very slow since the expectation step takes a very long time to converge when you have multiple layers in the neural network/hierarchical model. The authors propose to overcome the speed issue with incremental expectation maximization ala Neal and Hinton where gradient steps are taken with the expectation and maximization step either interleaved or in parallel."

I do not see it. \n\n* The caption of Table 1 should specify whether these are train or test accuracies.\n\n* The sentence preceding the \"Comparison with BP\" section in page 6 seems redundant (seems to repeat the previous sentence); consider removing it if not necessary.\n\n* Could you clarify which dataset the statement \"reported the highest accuracy obtained\" in Figure 3 refers to (train or test set)?\n\n* The statement about iPC performing better on standard CNN than on AlexNet contradicts Table 1. According to Table 1, CNN accuracy is around 72\\% whereas AlexNet accuracy is around 80\\%. Therefore, iPC does not perform better on standard CNN than on AlexNet.\n\n* The proposed method has one aspect that is not bio-plausible: it suffers from the weight transport problem, i.e. Eq. 6 requires the transpose of the forward mapping. I think this limitation can be discussed in Appendix section A (A Discussion on Biological Plausibility).\n\n* There is an artificial empty space in the top right of page 19 caused by the caption of Figure 6.\n\n* I think the plots in Figure 7 should include y-axis labels.
