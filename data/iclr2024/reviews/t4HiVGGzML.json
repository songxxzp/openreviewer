The authors proposes approach called Search-Adaptor, aimed at efficiently and robustly customizing LLMs for information retrieval. Search-Adaptor modifies the text embeddings from pre-trained LLMs and can be seamlessly integrated with various LLMs, including those accessible via APIs. This method is a lightweight method, which shows its effectiveness in zero shot retrieval tasks."

Nevertheless, the main reason is that the queries usually contain less information than documents. Previous work usually employs query expansion methods to enhance the query representations, such as using KG, PRF, and LLMs. The other possible motivation is that the idea can adapt the LLMs to utilize the retrieval tools. Overall, I suggest the authors should carefully describe their motivations.\n2. Widely used retrieval benchmarks, such as MSMARCO is not used in experiments. \n3. The experimental results are not good on some QA tasks, such as HotpotQA and NQ.  \n4. No query extension baselines are compared. The Promptagator and PRF models should be compared. Experimental results on coCondenser or GTR should also be conducted.\n5. The differences between this work and others[1-2] should be described.\n6. The citation formulation seems wrong.\n\n[1] Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval without Relevance Labels.\n[2] Promptagator: Few-shot dense retrieval from 8 examples."
