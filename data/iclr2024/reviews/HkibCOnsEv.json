This modification allows the KFAC algorithm to be utilized in low-precision training scenarios, eliminating the need for computationally expensive matrix inverses.\nThe authors propose an inverse-free KFAC update scheme, inspired by the inverse-free Kronecker-factored natural gradient descent\n(INGD) algorithm. This scheme enables the KFAC algorithm to be used without requiring matrix inverses, making it suitable for low-precision training. \n\n- Imposition of a Kronecker-factored structure on INGD: \nThe authors impose a Kronecker-factored structure on the INGD algorithm and propose structured inverse-free natural gradient descent (SINGD). This structural modification allows for the utilization of sparse structures, effectively reducing memory costs.

Making KFAC inverse-free for low-precision training: The authors propose an inverse-free KFAC update scheme, which eliminates the need for computationally expensive matrix inverses. This modification enables the KFAC algorithm to be effectively used in low-precision training scenarios, where precision is reduced to reduce memory and computational requirements.\n\n2.

However, it fails to demonstrate completely new elements that offer significant advantages over previous approaches. Furthermore, upon reviewing the original INGD algorithm, it appears that the authors of the original work already discussed the sparse structures by considering sparse group structures in K and C. Consequently, the imposition of a Kronecker-factored structure on the INGD algorithm may be considered trivial, and not a substantial contribution compared to the original INGD algorithm. As a result, the overall strength of this work may not be sufficient for it to be accepted as a significant advancement in the field.\n\nAfter rebuttal, I agree that this paper provides fair improvements on the existing algorithms KFAC and INGD."

The visualization makes it hard to see how the proposed methods compared to Adam near the end. Also, I think the evaluation will be more reasonable under settings where KFAC outperforms Adam. Such examples can be found in some previous work like [1].\n3. The application of the block diagonal structure seems to be straightforward and existing. So it feels important that the proposed structure should be shown to solidly outperform block diagonal or some other simpler structure to have contribution on this part, but the discussion and the evaluation does not seem to be in-depth. The hierarchical structure seems to be interesting and outperforms the block diagonal structure, but the exact setting for the experiment is a bit unclear. For clarity, it is better to show how model weights with more than two dimensions are merged into two dimensions and the resulting dimensionality. Also, papers like [1] seem to suggest that for CNN, it is plausible for one Kronecker factor to be small and dense, while the other to be large but diagonal. This kind of structure is interesting to be considered/compared with, and it also suggests that setting the sparsity parameter to be the same for both Kronecker factors might not be the best for comparison.\n\n[1] Bahamou, A., Goldfarb, D., & Ren, Y.
