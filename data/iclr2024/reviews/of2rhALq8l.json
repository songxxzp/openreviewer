Using a unique gradual mask optimization method aligned with the Levy-Desplanques theorem, invertibility of transformations is ensured.

A comparative analysis with these methods would accentuate the novelty and efficacy of the proposed technique. Reference for consideration: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00317.\n\n- Regarding Figure 3, my understanding is that the loss of a partial layer during MRE PTQ might not directly correlate with improved model performance, especially in the context of generative AI models.\n\n- I have a few observations concerning Section 4, which details experimental results:\n   1) A significant concern is the sole reliance on PPL scores as a performance metric. While it corresponds to dataset loss, recent LLM compression research suggests that PPL may not fully capture the generative capabilities post-quantization. It might be worthwhile to consider metrics like common-sense reasoning or evaluations using the MMLU dataset.\n   2) Additionally, an increase in PPL scores by over 10 points indicates a significant degradation in the generation capabilities of the quantized model. Thus, contrasting the performance of such models, like the W2A16 results mentioned in the abstract, might not provide meaningful insights. A closer look at the actual generation outputs from these severely quantized models could reveal issues like non-coherent results or repeated verbiage.\nLastly, larger models could yield different outcomes, as they might exhibit distinct patterns of outliers or weight distributions."
