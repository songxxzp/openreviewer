By constructing a clustering-based middle layer with RBF, all the input samples are projected to cluster space for comparing their distances to cluster centroids, which is benefit for separating anomalies from samples. Besides, an RBF-similarity-score-based criterion is proposed for optimizing the parameters as well as evaluating the effect of proposed methods."

Questions can be raised about fairness in comparisons when details from settings are omitted\n\n- Missing related work, datasets, new benchmarks\n\nThe work focuses on a very narrow part of the literature (emerging due to the rise of DNN solutions) but definitely omits new progress on benchmarks, baselines, new evaluation measures [a,b].\n\nNew benchmarks, ~20 datasets, ~2000 timeseries, 10+ baselines\n[a] TSB-UAD: an end-to-end benchmark suite for univariate time-series anomaly detection.\" Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 15.8 (2022): 1697-1711.\n\nNew evaluation measures\n[b] \"Volume under the surface: a new accuracy evaluation measure for time-series anomaly detection.\" Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 15.11 (2022): 2774-2787."
