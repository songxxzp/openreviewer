To this end, the authors propose to study the random-feature (RF) regression model and show that their approximation to the test error strictly decreases when more data points and more width are provided. Then, they characterize which tasks obtain optimal performance when the training error is much smaller than the test error. Finally, some empirical evidence supporting the theory is provided."

How are the approximations of the train and test errors on page 4 derived. I think it is crucial to at least provide intuitions about them and quantify the approximation errors. This is because much of the results of the paper rely on those approximations.\n2. The term \"interpolation\" keeps coming up without being defined. Maybe it is obvious for people in this specific field; however, for the benefit of a broader audience, the authors should be more verbose.\n\nSecond, I'm unsure about the significance of the theoretical results. Mainly because the authors claim that the test error becomes better as $n$, $k$ increase because the RF model converges to the kernel regression limit. However, it is a bit hard to believe since kernel machines (RFs, GPs) are in general worse than their finite-width NNs counterpart (kernel machines = linear models => no representation learning). As the authors mentioned on page 5, Thm. 1 works since intuitively RF -> kernel machine; the latter is the ideal limiting process. If this is the case, doesn't this imply that GPs should be better than standard NNs?"

The authors mentioned that \"we do not want to take a fixed noise variance\" and then argued that it is better to scale it proportional to the uncaptured signal. I'm not sure if this is realistic since $\\sigma^2$ is the aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainty inherent in the data (think about the noise resulting from some measurement error in a sensor). How do you handle this, then? Maybe you should instead argue using the language of GPs, and thus give you the freedom to talk about _epistemic uncertainty_, which decreases as $n$ increases?\n3. How should one relate Thm. 1 and Fig. 1? In the former, the test error should always decrease, but in the latter, the test error saturates. Note that, I think Fig. 1 is the \"correct\" behavior: kernel machines are not powerful and thus the test error is bounded away from zero, higher than DNN's. (As for the train error, this seems fine since infinite-width => linearity => quadratic loss => global optimum is achievable.)\n4. How does this paper relate to the work of [Bowman & Montufar (NeurIPS 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02927), which also studies the large-width large-data regime?\n\nThanks!"

In practice, it seems that the bigger the model is, the better the performance it gets.\nThis paper recovers this behavior in the setting of learning ridge regression with random features. Namely, the authors establish that, for a correctly tuned ridge regression, the model's test error always improves with the number of features and the number of training samples. That is, the \"double descent\" phenomenon can be eliminated by correctly tuning the model's parameters. Additionally, the authors show that overfitting is necessary to achieve good performance in some settings with low noise. That is, not only overfitting doesn't hurt performance, but it also enables reaching optimal test error."

The experiments seem to be convincing that the assumptions made in the analysis are reasonable in practical settings."

It would be helpful, even for the \"nonrigorous\" steps, where some quantity is approximated, to state what are the precise bounds on the estimations. For the theorem statements in the paper, the way they are currently written, it is not clear if they truly follow from the assumptions, or are there some additional approximations (beyond the one covered in Assumption A) that are used in the analysis.\n\nAdditionally, for the results in Section 5, it is not clear what is the role that the noise plays in the analysis. Clearly, for large enough noise, overfitting hurts performance, i.e. - there is a predictor for which train error might be high (or even very high). While I understand that the noise might need to be scaled down (i.e., not analyze the setting of constant noise), it seems that the results in the paper only cover relatively low noise setting. What happens for higher noise levels? Do we expect overfitting to be unnecessary, or even hurt performance?\n\nMinor:\nPage 7, Target noise paragraph - \"unlike is conventional\" is probably a typo."

This theoretical evaluation matches well empirical experiments. In addition, by focusing on the KRR limit, the authors succeeded in obtaining a more detailed evaluation for the case of power-law eigenstructure.

I mean, the heuristic derivation is rather straightforward.  It seems that the authors just substituted a heuristically-derived terms for the kernel matrix of RF (eqs.26-30) into a well-known expression of the generalization error (eqs.13, 14). I understand that providing a unified formulation itself is a very curious and interesting attempt, though.  Please refer to my Question (i) for more details. \n\n\n\n(ii) The definition of overfitting in this paper is unique, and its relation to the ridgeless case seems unclear. considering a ridgeless case seems appropriate when talking about overfitting to training samples. Indeed, Mei & Montanari 2019 have reported a certain condition where generalization error is minimized in a ridgeless setting and this was one of the main contributions.\nIn contrast, the current study does not directly analyze the ridgeless case but rather allows a non-zero fitting ratio in its analysis. For example, while Theorem 2 contemplates the optimal ridge, it's not explicitly stated when the optimal ridge becomes zero. I am also curious whether the noise condition in Corollary 1 works as a necessary and sufficient condition where the ridge-less case gives the best performance (I mean, the generalization error is minimized)."

However, the authors give not enough explanation on how and which paper has derived this equation.  As long as I know, Sollich, 2001, Bordelon et al., 2020 obtained this expression for KRR by using some heuristic derivations. Did the other work that you cited, i.e., Jacot et al., 2020a; Simon et al., 2021; Loureiro et al., 2021; Dobriban &Wager, 2018; Wu & Xu, 2020; Hastie et al., 2020; Richards et al., 2021,  explicitly give this expression (13) as well? If so, under what conditions does each study derive? Are they mathematically rigorous?  Because this equation is the starting point of all other analyses, it should be clearly and carefully described. \n\n(ii) I am confused about what the authors try to claim in Figure 2. Do you intend to claim that overfitting is obligatory only for the noiseless case ($\\sigma_{rel}^2=0$)? For $\\sigma_{rel}^2>0$, the minimal test MSE is obtained for non-zero fitting ratios. This implies that the generalization is the best for non-overfitting situations and the overfitting seems *not* obligatory. This point is unclear.\n \n**Minor ones**\n\n(iii) In Section 5, the authors focused on the KRR limit (k -> infty). I am curious about at what point the finite-k case becomes hard to analyze. \n\n(iv) Page 6: The definition of the fitting ratio seems to be wrong.
