These bounds are the first of their kind for the problem addressed in the study.\n2. **Modeling Contributions**: The research provides insight into the structure of distributed interactive learning algorithms, showing how each client's contribution at each round affects the generalization error of the final model. \n3. **Applicability to FSVM**: The paper applies these theoretical bounds to Federated Support Vector Machines (FSVM) and derives explicit bounds for generalization error. Notably, it reveals that more frequent communication with the parameter server reduces the generalization power of FSVM algorithms. This suggests that the parameter R can be optimized to minimize the population risk of FSVM.\n4. **Generalization of Findings**: The research demonstrates that the generalization error of the FSVM setting decreases faster than that of centralized learning by a factor proportional to O(log(K)/K) for any value of R. This generalizes recent findings for \"one-shot\" Federated Learning to any arbitrary number of rounds."

This assumption may be considered strong and unrealistic, as many Federated Learning (FL) approaches typically use the entire batch for training in each round. Furthermore, in real-world scenarios, a mix of old and new data is often present in an online approach. \n\n2. **Counter-Intuitive Observation**: Moreover, if we consider a fixed n, each client ends up with n/R data for each communication round. To illustrate this with a special case, let's take R=1, which essentially reduces the scenario to centralized learning. Surprisingly, based on the results presented in the paper, which indicate that the generalization error increases with R, it might suggest that R=1 should be chosen. This finding appears counter-intuitive and raises questions about the practicality and relevance of the assumed setting for real-world federated learning applications."

                "value": "-  The definition of $P_{\\mathbf{W},\\mathbf{S}}$ is unclear. Is it a distribution over $\\mathcal{W}^{(K+1)R}$ and then, is the use of the product $\\Pi$ equivalent to $\\otimes$ ? Otherwise, if it is a distribution over $\\mathcal{W}$ can you make this explicit? \n- Given the way $S_k$ is partitioned for any $k$, users are not allowed to use their whole dataset at each round but only a smaller fraction $n_R$. Is it a realistic in practice? For instance take the instance of federated learning between hospital to better detect a rare disease (i.e. each user has few data), is it reasonable in this case to force the users not to use their whole dataset each round? Furthermore, this would imply that if $n$ is small, then one would not be allowed to perform many training rounds.  What can the authors say about this?  \n- In section 2, you said that 'the aggregation function at the PS is set to be deterministic and arbitrary' while in Theorem 1,  $\\bar{W}^{[r-1]}$ is drawn according to a probability distribution, what did I miss? Furthermore, how costful is this additional expectation in terms of computational time as it does not appear in many classical PAC-Bayes bounds?\n- I found Theorem 1's proof poorly organised, for instance,  $\\mathbf{\\nu}_{S}$ is defined in Lemma 1's proof, which has been put on another appendix. Similarly, I did not find a definition of $\\mathcal{G}_S^{\\delta}$ although somewhat inferable from context.\n- I don't understand the use of the subgausiannity assumption at the end of page 2022. Let rename $X= gen(s_k^{(r)}, \\bar{W}^{(R)})$, then you affirm that because $X$ is $\\sigma_{k,r}:= \\sqrt{\\frac{R}{4n}}$ subgaussian we have $\\mathbb{E}[e^{\\lambda X^2}]\\leq \\frac{2n}{R}$.  This is highly non-standard, how do you prove it?  To me, subgaussianity would only imply $\\mathbb{E}[e^{\\lambda X}]\\leq \\exp(\\frac{\\lambda^2 \\sigma_{k,r}^2}{2})$.    \n- About the experiments, I am not convinced that communicating less implies a better learning phase, at least for FVSM. Indeed, this conclusion appears to be true for $K=10,20$ (not the case $K=50$ as the short decrease in the end of the curve exhibits more a stabilisation than a deterioration) and holds when considering the generalisation gap, instead of observing directly the population risk . Thus, if we focus on the notion of population risk, Figure 4 shows that increasing the number of rounds only leads to positive outcomes as the empirical risk continues to decrease while the population risk either decreases or stabilises. A similar conclusion can be derived from Figure 6. I acknowledge that you affirm in section D.2 that 'fewer rounds may be needed, if one can effectively take the \u201cestimated\u201d generalisation error into account', but a practitioner does not have access to this information and see only benefits to continue its training as the empirical risk decreases, and the test error does not vary: there is no stopping criterion in practice. \nTo me, the interest of a tradeoff in $R$, only appears in Figure 3, which is not covered by Theorem 4.\n\n\nIn conclusion, although my enthusiasm about having PAC-Bayesian guarantees tailored to FL, I believe this paper needs to be rewritten before its acceptance, given my current concerns about the correctness of Theorem 1 and the shift between the message conveyed by the paper (starting from its title) and the proposed experiments."

In most settings in FL, the number of samples per client (N) is small, and the number of rounds is much higher. Additionally, I don't see if the current analysis is possible to extend to these cases.\n\n2) Generally in FL papers with a focus on optimization, they report the curves about the loss and accuracy of the test set during the training, and it's common that the performance on the test set improves over more rounds, so the results can't extend to the more general cases, beyond FL-SVM.\n\n3) The quantity of interest in ML is the true risk (population risk) and not the generalization. Even with the current assumptions, If the speed of decrease of training loss is more than the increase of generalization, it's not possible to argue the smaller number of rounds is better. In Fig 4. and Fig 8. of the appendix we can't see the increase in the population risk with the number of rounds for FL-SVM.\n\n4) As mentioned in the paper, another approach would be to just apply basic PAC-Bayes bounds such as McAllester's without explicitly considering the dynamics of FL. Some numerical comparison of these bounds is needed. It's not clear to me that the bound in theorem 1 gives a better guarantee. McAllester's bound doesn't have the structure of the FL explicitly, however, it would be applied to the output of the algorithm and that might be enough. Also, it doesn't require the assumptions mentioned in the weakness 1.\n\n5) Based on my understanding of the analysis, I assume that the same approach can be applied to the number of local steps per round if each data point would participate in just one local round. As a result, the number of local steps would also appear in the bound. It would be interesting to see its effect, as in the experiments of the paper, the total number of SGD steps is fixed, and with the increase of R, the number of local steps decreases."
