It is not clear why such patching will help the learning of spatiotemporal representations. Furthermore, the relation with two baselines \u2014 MLAE that reconstructs spatial patches and MTAE that reconstructs temporal patches \u2014 need to be better clarified. \n\nThe assumption of the method, in particular to what type of ECG signals and tasks this will apply, needs to be better discussed. For instance, the use of temporal patching seems to rely on the assumption that the rhythm  within the input signal length (e.g., 10s) \u2014 whether it is normal or abnormal \u2014is regular and periodic.  Is that true? How would this work for rhythms that are irregular (e.g., atrial fibrillation), or rhythms where the abnormal rhythm only shows up in transient beats within a longer segment (which is typical for some PVCs and tachycardias). If the method is not designed for these scenarios, it should be clearly clarified.  \n\nRelated to the above comments, more details about the data and classification tasks needed to be given. What are the labels of rhythms being classified? Does each 10-s segment only has one label? The paper did a good job in highlighting the it\u2019s important to develop methodology to the application problem at hand \u2014 this should also be reflected when describing data and experimental settings, as different ECG tasks can mean that the features one are looking for is very different (e.g. is it a regular rhythm, is it an irregular rhythm, is it a transient rhythm, etc).\n\nOverall, while the performance gain is notable, they are also overall limited \u2014 at 2 decimal points compared to supervised baselines wen using 100% data. It is not clear what is the clinical significance of such performance gain. Perhaps it is because the supervised baselines are already quite good in the tasks considered (over 0.9 AUROC in both downstream datasets). It may be more convincing if the authors could find \u201charder\u201d base tasks in order to see if the proposed method will have clinical significance."

The 12 leads ECG signal is divided into temporal patches. Some patches are masked and the task is to reconstruct the masked signal. Each encoded patch is then added to a LEAD-specific encoding (a way to identify from which lead the signal is coming from) and to the traditional positional encoding (a way to identify temporary where the patch belongs). Additionally, a special token is appended and postponed to each lead signal. Since some leads share a highly correlated signal the decoder is a Lead-wise shared decoder (i.e. it only attempts to decode the signal from 1 lead at the time, this is to ensure that the task is not trivially solved by copying the masked patched from a highly correlated lead).\n\nAfter training a labeled dataset can be sued to train a linear layer on top of the encoder, or to fully fine-tuned the model.\n\nThe proposed model is pre-trained using a total of 188,480 ECGs 12 leads signals coming from three datasets (Chapman, Ningbo, CODE-15), and if tested using two different datasets PTB-XL and CPSC2018 on the task of detecting cardiac arrhythmia and myocardial infarction. Results (in terms of accuracy, F1 and AUROC) show that with linear fine-tuning, the proposed method performs better than other SSL methods albeit it still underperforms the supervised baseline. When fine-tuning, however, the proposed method surpasses also the supervised baselined in all the metrics employed. \n\nThe current method is also resilient to lower amount of data compared to all alternatives tested as shown by achieving the best results in terms of AUROC using only 1% and 5% of the fine-tuning dataset. \n\nAdditionally, the authors perform experiments using only a sub set of the leads or using only 1 lead (as in the PhysioNet2017 dataset). The proposed technique remains the best  performer across all baselines."
