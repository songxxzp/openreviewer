Starting with two motivating examples, this paper introduces decoupled regularizers whose range is constant over action spaces. The authors further prove that the range of a general class of standard regularizers grows with the number of actions. Two solutions of temperature selection, static v.s., dynamic, are proposed based on which practical algorithms can be implemented. The proposed solutions are evaluated in toy examples, DMC and drug design environments with SQL, SAC and GFN as backbones and baselines. The results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions."

The authors argue that the weight of the regularization term should vary depending on the environment and even sometimes based on the specific state, since the range of values the regularizer can take might depend heavily on the action space. To solve this problem, the authors introduce a method for dynamically setting the regularization coefficient based on the maximum and minimum values the regularizer can take at a particular state. They show that this can improve RL performance compared to using the same coefficient across environments."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the paper is promising, I worry that in it's current form it is not ready for publication at a top conference. First, the contribution is relatively small, since it is already known how to choose the entropy coefficient for many environments (e.g., via the SAC rule of using $\\bar{H}=-n$) and it often needs to be tuned regardless depending on the scale of the reward function. While I still think the ideas here are useful, the writing, theory, and experiments should be of very high quality to justify publication.\n\nHowever, I found the paper to be often unclear and imprecise, making it difficult to read. See the list of issues below for a partial list of the problems I noticed. The fact that many claims are unprecise and thus actually incorrect as stated makes it difficult to know which contributions to trust.\n\nOne possible extension to this work that could increase the contribution of the paper is to also include regularization to a base policy, as is often done in RLHF for LLMs via a KL divergence regularization term (e.g., see Bai et al., \"Training a Helpful and Harmless Assistant with\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\"). There have been various papers attempting to find a systematic way of setting the regularization coefficient (e.g., the above paper and Gao et al., \"Scaling Laws for Reward Model Overparameterization\"), but none have considered possible setting the coefficient differently at different states, so this could be an interesting direction to apply the ideas presented in this paper.\n\nAlso, a relevant paper is \"LESS is More: Rethinking Probabilistic Models of Human Behavior\" by Bobu et al. They approach the problem from the motivation of modeling human behavior, which under the \"Boltzmann rational\" model is equivalent to solving a regularized MDP. They have a different approach to solving the issue of how the number of actions or number of trajectories that can achieve a particular reward affects the optimal regularized solution. It would be good to compare the approach in this paper with theirs.\n\n**Issues with clarity and precision:**\n * The first paragraph of the intro argues \"changing the action space should not change the optimal policy.\" This is true in most cases\u2014the issue is that \"changing the action space should not change the optimal *entropy-regularized* policy.\" I think it's important to make this distinction since otherwise it sounds wrong.\n * In Section 2, it is not specified that the MDPs considered have discrete actions, although it later appears this is an unspoken assumption. Then later, the paper switches to continuous MDPs without any explicit distinction.\n * In Section 2, according to the formalism in Geist et al., $\\Omega$ should really be a function of only $\\pi(s)$, not of $\\pi$ in general.\n * In Section 2, the first time regularization is introduced it's with $\\tau \\Omega(\\pi)$ subtracted from the value function; then immediately below it's instead added to the value function.\n * The definition of $\\Omega^*_\\tau$ is unclear.\n * Proof of Lemma 1: this proof seems insufficient; why exactly does convexity imply any other point must be smaller?\n * In SAC, the entropy is actually calculated before applying $\\tanh$ to squash the actions into the action space. This means that the entropy is unbounded, and thus the idea in this paper does not apply directly.\n\n**Typos:**\n * Proof of Lemma 1: \"supermum\" -> \"supremum\"\n * Section 3 title: \"graviation\" -> \"gravitation\""

To my knowledge, state-dependent temperatures is not itself a novel concept, as other works have tried to dynamically set temperature based on state [1, 2]. The results would be more convincing if the authors showed that prior efforts in state-dependent regularization fail whereas theirs succeeds.\n\n2.
