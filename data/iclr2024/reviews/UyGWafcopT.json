I don't find it to be a useful 'representation' for training or other applications like vector-space representation. In fact, they merely use the divergence between the conditional probabilities to measure text similarity. If this approach hasn't been taken by others, then this divergence could be considered novel. Thus, I cautiously suggest they use 'inverse perplexity mapping' rather than 'meaning representation'. The paper's title could then be 'A New Measurement for Sentence Similarity via Sampling Trajectories in Autoregressive Models'. Furthermore, 'semantic representations' appear suddenly following Algorithm 1. I recommend they use 'inverse perplexity mapping for substrings' instead of 'semantic representations'.\n\n2) I'm unsure what is meant by 'meaning containment'. Why use 'containment', which typically refers to 'the action of keeping something harmful under control or within limits'?

Since $\\sum_{\\mathrm{len}(t) = m} M_u(t)^{m} = \\sum_{\\mathrm{len}(t) = m} M_v (t)^{m} = 1$, we cannot have $M_u(t) < M_v(t)$ for all $t\\in \\mathcal{A}^*$.

Is it the temperature parameter used during the inference process in the autoregressive model? Please clarify this.\n\n5) I believe we should use the training set for the model to compute $\\overline{M}_u$. Does the text corpus WikiText reflect the distribution of the training set?"

They explore the ability to modify the notion of similarity by augmenting those sentences with prompts, and evaluate on zero-shot Semeval STS tasks, a task of comparing captions to CLIP outputs, and (using a modified approach to focus on single-word characterization) a lexical semantics task (WordNet hypernym modeling)."
