It actually took me several readings to really piece together the fact that the treatment of the hidden state is under discussed in the literature and the two options presented in this paper are better than the existing approaches as a result of the confusing Markov narrative. This is perhaps a small point, and I'm only one reader -- if the Markov framework helps convey the story to others this is my weakness, and not the paper's but I though it was worth mentioning here."

This suggests that G-ForgetNet falls back to the baseline in these cases, hence ensuring the history embeddings are actually not being used may help with performance.\n    - Another reason is that according Fig 5, the gate value is ~0.38 even at the end of training.

However, there are trainability issues (e.g. accumulating errors early in training) that can be addressed in different ways. The paper proposes one solution, gating, but some questions remain \u2014 why is gating better than the NN more generally learning how to combine historical and current embeddings, as in the baseline? Moreover, what are other solutions, possibly not involving learning?\n\nLastly, the TripletGMPNN includes a gating layer in the single-task setup. A discussion on how this differs from the gating in G-ForgetNet should be included."
