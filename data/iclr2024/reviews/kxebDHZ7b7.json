This somehow does not follow the idea of Trust Region Regularization which adds additional constraint on top of the loss according to the measure. More accurately, they are two different things. And, I could not find a clear meaning why using such a distance as the neighbourhood radius could give the \"Trust\". Several questions arise: what does the \"trust\" indicate in the proposed method? Why we should not trust the region that is not in the proposed method but in SAM (and ASAM, Fisher-SAM)? Why the given region would not harm the pre-trained models while SAM could? Clear answers are missing in the current paper. Also, it is highly recommended that the authors use figures to illustrate this and the core of the presented method.\n\n2. The Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) could also lead to a similar effect as TTR methods. The authors may need to also consider or compare SWA with the TRR and the proposed method. The following papers may be helpful.\n\n    [1] Kaddour, Jean, et al. \"When do flat minima optimizers work?.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 16577-16595.\n\n    [2] Wortsman, Mitchell, et al. \"Model soups: averaging weights of multiple fine-tuned models improves accuracy without increasing inference time.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2022.\n\n3. From the paper, I see nearly no discussions regarding why and how the proposed method could contribute the fine-tuning in the related section, given that the authors claim \"their method could not forget the pre-trained structure\". BTW, I think their abstract may be somewhat over-claimed. It is interesting to see that the authors are aiming to study the effect of SAM specifically in fine-tuning. But unfortunately, the current version could not present sufficient helpful insights.\n\n4. It would be more impactful that the the authors present results using the proposed method on some recent popular scalable pre-trained llm such as llama. \n\n\n5.

In particular, I remember SAM achieving state-of-the art for various vision tasks (CIFAR, ImageNet etc...). Given that the effectiveness of SAM was first demonstrated on these benchmark tasks, **for future research I think it is required for follow-up works to sanity check the performance of the proposed methods on the same setting as the original SAM paper**. In particular, if the new methods end up giving a worse performance than SAM for the settings considered in the SAM paper, that would be an important information for practitioners.\n(As I mentioned in the strength part, the authors' quite comprehensive experiments on the language modeling tasks of choice look great; however, since this work follows up on the original SAM paper, **some experiments that benchmark the new method against the original SAM on the task that SAM did great seems required**.)\n\n- Also, it's great that the authors built their default algorithm on ASAM. But, given that SAM has been quite popular, as a reader, I'm quite curious how the SAM version of TRAM (instead of ASAM) performs. In particular, **is ASAM type of updates really necessary?**\n\n- Given that the main motivation of this work is to develop an optimizer for learning good-representation, I think at least one experiment is needed for pre-training from scratch. In particular, do you think having a reasonable pre-trained model is necessary for TRAM to work well? As far as I know, it's still debated in the literature **whether SAM-type of updates are required in the beginning of the training or at the end of the training**. Some theoretical works have claimed that it's only effective at the end of the training (**as did in this work**), but empirical works also have claimed that it's required from the beginning of the training.\n\n- In Figure 1, could you clarify what the negative and positive slopes are supposed to be interpreted as? Also I can't really understand how to interpret this plot.\n\n- In Table 5, why didn't you present the statistics for the other two variants of TRAM?\n\nI acknowledge the novelty of this work. However, given the extensive experiments in the previous works (e.g. original SAM work), in order to make a case about the effectiveness of the proposed methods, **I think some more \"sanity-check\" experiments are needed. Especially, because this work is empirical in nature.** I'm voting for weak accept at the moment, but I'll make the final decision based on how the authors address my questions."
