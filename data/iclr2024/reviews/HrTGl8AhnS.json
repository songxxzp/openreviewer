Based on HyperNet, the proposed PACIA makes no significant technical contribution.\n3. Poor writing. Many sentences are grammatically wrong. Some examples are:\n* [In Sec. 1] First is that ... difference.\n* [In Sec. 1] The chemical space is enormous that ... range.\n* [In Sec. 1] The molecule-level difference ... molecules.\n* [In Sec. 1] While others ... accurately.\nNote that four of the first 6 sentences of this paragraph are grammatically incorrect.\nThere are many errors in addition to the above examples. The authors are suggested to carefully proofread the paper to correct the errors.\n4. The design in modulating propagation depth seems not fully reasonable. According to Eqn. (8), $[p]_l$ measures the probability of the event that \"the $l$-th layer is in the model\". However, from Eqn. (7),  the only constraint on $[p]_l $ is $\\sum_l [p]_l = 1$. So it is likely that for some $1<i<j<L$, $[p]_i < [p]_j$. That is to say, a hidden layer (i.e., layer $j$) is more likely to be in the model than a layer before it (i.e. layer $i$), which is unreasonable."
