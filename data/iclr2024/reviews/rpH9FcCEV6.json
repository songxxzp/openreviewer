When the diffusion model is used for some tasks such as inpainting and classification, it requires the use of intermediate results. In such cases, their method can be employed to attack the model. It\u2019s reasonable.\n4.\tExperimental results showed that diffusion models directly outputting audio are more robust compared to models outputting mel-spectrograms. This paper recommended using models that directly output audio to enhance robustness."
