                "value": "1. One limitation of the proposed method, as highlighted in Section 6, is its computational complexity. The method approximately doubles the training time, imposing a considerable computational load. Furthermore, while the added complexity during inference may not substantially contribute to the overall computational demand, a detailed report of the actual inference times would be beneficial for a comprehensive understanding of the method's characteristics.\n2. In the experiments, the proposed method is primarily benchmarked against SSM-based methods. However, various approaches employ convolution for embedding, for example in [1], and the use of convolutional layers or simple components for positional encoding is a common practice [2, 3, 4, 5]. It would be instructive to compare the proposed method with Vision Transformers that incorporate the methods to exploit spatial equivariance, which could serve as additional baselines. Furthermore, while it may not be a critical flaw, the implementation of the proposed method appears to be somewhat more complicated and less straightforward than simply employing convolutional layers.\n3. I believe that a larger model and dataset size would more effectively leverage strong spatial equivariance [6]. This implies that the proposed method may not be effective in environments with substantial data and model scales. Considering that training on datasets like IN1K with 'Base' or larger models has become a norm in the era of Vision Transformers, the applicability of the proposed method in such standard real-world scenarios could be limited. Additionally, the focus of the experiments on smaller datasets and models further suggests potential constraints in its utility for larger-scale tasks.\n\n.\n\n[1] Xiao, Tete, et al. \"Early convolutions help transformers see better.\"\u00a0*Advances in neural information processing systems*\u00a034 (2021): 30392-30400.\n\n[2] Chu, Xiangxiang, et al. \"Conditional positional encodings for vision transformers.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.10882 (2021).\n\n[3] Wu, Kan, et al. \"Rethinking and improving relative position encoding for vision transformer.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2021.\n\n[4] Liu, Ze, et al. \"Swin transformer v2: Scaling up capacity and resolution.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2022.\n\n[5] Chu, Xiangxiang, et al. \"Twins: Revisiting the design of spatial attention in vision transformers.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 9355-9366.\n\n[6] Gruver, Nate, et al. \"The lie derivative for measuring learned equivariance.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.02984 (2022).\n\n---\n\n**Post rebuttal**\n\nThank you for your efforts in conducting additional experiments.

Through empirical evaluation, the authors demonstrate that their layer acts as a general-purpose booster for vision transformers, surpassing standard methods like positional encoding in effectively integrating positional bias, all the while maintaining efficiency in terms of parameters and computation at inference.\n\nThe work is well-grounded in control theory, with the authors providing theoretical analysis to show that their layer generalizes S4ND and exhibits greater expressiveness. The submission includes supplementary code, facilitating reproducibility and practical application of the proposed method. Overall, this work presents a significant contribution to the field of computer vision, introducing a novel layer that addresses key challenges in 2-D inductive bias and demonstrates notable performance enhancements for Vision Transformers."

The current results lack persuasive power as they do not strictly control factors, making it difficult to definitively attribute performance gains to the proposed method.\n\n2. **Simplicity of Tasks**: The tasks used to evaluate the method are considered too simple, raising questions about whether the inductive bias introduced is specifically beneficial for such tasks. A more critical evaluation would involve assessing the performance of the baseline methods after large-scale pre-training to assess if the learned inductive bias during pretraining can obtain better performance in downstream tasks after finetuning (etc., prompt tuning). If such an approach yields better results, the practical significance of the proposed 2D-SSM becomes unclear.\n\n3. **Limited to Transformer-based Architectures**: The method primarily targets transformer structures that lack explicit inductive bias design. It is uncertain how well the method would perform on convolutional networks (ConvNets) and how it compares to similar inductive bias methods, such as ConvNeXt. A comprehensive evaluation across different network architectures and inductive bias strategies is needed to fully understand the method's applicability and effectiveness."
