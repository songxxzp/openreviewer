                "value": "In this paper, the authors presented an improved multi-level Gibbs sampler using quantum machinery that improves the zero-sum game solver of [BGJST23] from $O(\\sqrt{m+n}\\gamma^{2.5})$ to $O(\\sqrt{m+n}\\gamma^{2.25})$. Consequentially, this also leads to an improved linear program solver that runs in $O(\\sqrt{m+n}\\gamma^{2.25})$ time. Here, $\\gamma=Rr/\\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon$ is the accuracy and $R, r$ are $\\ell_1$ radius of optimal solution respectively. They allow $\\epsilon=O((m+n)^{-2})$ instead of the $\\epsilon=O((m+n)^{-1})$ due to [BGJST23]. To obtain these results, the authors leverage a better polynomial approximation due to [SV14] and a reparametrization of preprocessing. This enables them to improve [BGJST23]."

On the polynomial approximation front, I suspect a recent result due to Aggarwal and Alman [AA22] would lead direct improvement over the polynomial degree. The multi-Gibbs sampling algorithm appears to be novel, unfortunately, there're very little explanations on why the algorithm works and where the improvements actually come from. The algorithms and main results are listed in the paper without further elaboration, leaving the paper hard to evaluate and grasp the actual contribution. Nevertheless, I still believe the results obtained are strong, but in my honest opinion, the presentation can be significantly improved.\n\n[AA22] A. Aggarwal and J. Alman.

The main result is an $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{m+n}/\\epsilon^{2.25})$-time quantum solver for matrix zero-sum games. It improves the previous state-of-the-art quantum algorithm by a factor of $(1/\\epsilon)^{1/4}$. As a corollary, it implies an $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{m+n}/(Rr\\epsilon)^{2.25})$-time quantum linear programming solver. Technically, the algorithms are based on the sample-based optimistic weight update framework. And these improvements mainly come from a new multi-Gibbs sampler, which can (approximately) generate $k$ samples from the Gibbs distribution of the form $e^{\\beta H}$, where $H$ is a diagonal Hamiltonian (i.e., diagonal matrix). Notably, all previous quantum Gibbs sampler has a linear dependence on $\\beta$. This paper overcomes this barrier via an average argument."

                "value": "First and foremost, the writing of this paper is really bad. It is highly non-self-contained and directly uses theorem/lemma statements from previous papers without any explanation. In the main text it basically just puts the pseudocodes of the algorithms and states the time complexities, which makes it extremely difficult to understand how these algorithms work and to justify the correctness of the results. It only proves the Gibbs sampling result and does not prove the main theorems for matrix zero-sum games and LP. In short, the writing is not publication-ready yet and requires major revision. Second, I think the improvements over previous works are not significant enough to make it a new paper. It heavily uses technical results (Gao et al., 2023). For the LP result, it is a little hard to justify its usefulness since it is a first-order method and still has a $(Rr/\\epsilon)^{2.25}$ factor. This paper would be strengthened if it could provide examples of practical problems such that using the new quantum LP solver can improve the classical methods."
