The application of VQ-VAE to animal behavioural data specifically may be novel, but other than the multi-level encoding, it is not clear whether there are architectural/learning improvements that may be relevant to the broader ICLR reader. The listed contributions indicate potential novelty in behavioural neuroscience (ie. that this model simplifies the behavioural pipeline), which could perhaps suggest a different venue might be a better fit.\n- There is quite a lot of work on existing work on learning movement primitives or behavioural decomposition via latent variable models in embodied and robotics domains. The work could better be positioned in this context, and architectural design choices could be better justified.\n- The analysis could be more thorough; as it stands there is only one table of quantitative results, for motion synthesis, and the method is compared mostly to quite weak baselines (fully-connected MLP, GRU)."

Paraschos et al, 2013), or behavioural decomposition via latent variable models in embodied and robotics domains.\nMerel et al (2019a); Bohez et al (2022) apply hierarchical latent variable models to motion-capture data from humans and other mammals, and Merel et al (2019b) specifically studies learned representations of simulated rodent behaviour.\nOther works leverage latent variable representations of offline behavioural data in robotics (eg. Singh et al, 2021), including hierarchical discrete representations that can decompose data into discrete motifs that can execute / synthesize meaningful behaviours (Rao et al, 2022).\n- Related to these points, it\u2019s not clear why specific architectural choices were made. For example, encoding entire trajectories into a single latent code scales poorly with dimensionality of the inputs and length of the sequence, and many of the approaches from my previous comment use sequential latent variable models to better model embodied temporal data.\n\nSome minor comments:\n- Broken citation reference in the first paragraph\n- Having the related work as a final section reads a bit awkwardly to me, as it feels like an afterthought. Consider moving it to at least before the final discussion / conclusions, and ideally before the method itself to provide some scaffolding and context for the contributions and claims.\n\nReferences:\n- Paraschos et al (2013), Probabilistic Movement Primitives\n- Merel et al (2019a), Neural Probabilistic Motor Primitives for Humanoid Control\n- Merel et al (2019b), Deep Neuroethology of a Virtual Rodent\n- Singh et al (2021), Parrot: Data-Driven behavioral priors for reinforcement learning\n- Bohez et al (2022), Imitate and Repurpose: Learning Reusable Robot Movement Skills From Human and Animal Behaviors\n- Rao et al (2022), Learning Transferable Motor Skills with Hierarchical Latent Mixture Policies"
