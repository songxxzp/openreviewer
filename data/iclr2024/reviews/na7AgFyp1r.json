A notable contribution is the introduction of 3D graph isometrics for 3D graph isomorphism. The authors provide theoretical proof demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over the existing geometric WL test. A Bayesian geometric GNN is proposed and integrated into the active learning framework to compute uncertainties, which is accomplished by leveraging the estimated moments of the distributions of the 3D geometrics. The active sampling is formulated as a quadratic programming problem. Experiments on QM9 dataset are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

While there\u2019s room for enhancement (see questions and weakness), the current version of the manuscript efficiently facilitates a clear understanding of both the overarching motivation and the technical details in the proposed methodology.\n\n+ The experimental results presented are compelling, effectively underscoring the practical efficacy and reliability of the proposed method."

While it\u2019s evident that these constitute a complete isometry space, there exist various alternative approaches and descriptors to delineate the isometry space, such as using the first and second fundamental forms. Enhancing the section with additional references and a more thorough discussion that delves into the rationale behind the selection of these particular 3D isometrics would significantly bolster the clarity and comprehensiveness of the presentation."

It is not quite concise, as \"2D\" already indicates geometric information is considered\n\n- \\mathcal{SE}(3) -> $SE(3)$\n\n- Page 2 Section 2.2.1, how to ensure the bijective function f always exists? What if A and B have different numbers of points?\n\n- Page 2 Section 2.2.1, how do you define A and B? I guess you are using the matrix by concatenating the point positions, but an explicit definition is required.\n\n- Page 5 Section 2.3, what is the specific \"off-the-shelf QP solver\" being used? It is important to reveal the info here since different frameworks can result in very different computational speeds, as is already demonstrated in the experimental section. For example, how do you project the continuous solution to the binary space, are you using branch-and-bound?\n\n- For the experiments, I noticed almost all the cases, the proposed method achieves a better performance than baselines in a large margin at the beginning of the iteration. Though it can be attributed to the proposed GNN, I was wondering what will happen if the proposed method starts from a \"bad\" set of initial samples. How robust is the proposed method to the initialization? Can it still converge to a better result if the initialization is worse than existing methods?"
