Suppose we observe $m$ triplets $(x,y,z) \\in V^3$ and their labels in $\\{ -1, 1\\}$ where the label is $1$ if $x,y$ are closer than $x,z$ in the embedding space in $\\ell_p$ distance and $-1$ otherwise. The paper gives optimal order for sample complexity $m$ required to get to a misclassification error of $\\epsilon$. \n\nThe high level technique is to derive VC dimension (and Natarajan dimension for larger tuples, but we ignore results in the larger tuple case for now). The authors derive nearly tight order for VC dimension of such triplet classifiers. For upper bounding the VC dimension, they formulate the classification function as the sign of a polynomial in $nd$ dimensions. The key ingredient here is a fact from Warren (1968) that there are at most $(4epm/nd)^{nd}$ connected components in $\\mathbb{R}^{nd}$ where in each connected component, the signs of the $m$ polynomials are fixed. For proving the lower bound on VC dimension, the authors give a clever construction of a set of triplets which can be shattered.\n\nAuthors give their results to realizable and agnostic cases. They extend their results to several distance functions and tuples of size more than 3. They also study the well-separated case where the labeled triplets $(x,y^+,z^-)$ satisfy $\\rho(x,z) \\geq (1+\\alpha) \\rho(x,y)$ etc. for some $\\alpha > 0$."

A central finding is that for learning $\\ell_p$-distances, a minimum of $\\Theta(\\min(nd,n^2))$ labeled tuples is sufficient and necessary for depicting $d$-dimensional representations of $n$-point datasets. These results are applicable regardless of the input samples' distribution and derive from bounds on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis/Natarajan dimension of related problems. \n\nThis paper also demonstrates that theoretical boundaries derived from the VC/Natarajan dimension correlate strongly with experimental outcomes."
