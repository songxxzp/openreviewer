As MISL can not guarantee these properties, this work proposes LSEPIN to measure the disentanglement, and then shows the connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost.

Finally, this work proposes PWSEP and theoretically shows that it can discover all optimal initial policies."

[1] has shown that KL-based metric can only find skills with the ''largest radius'' and how to find all vertices of the skill polytope is still an open challenge. This work has elegantly solved this challenge and I believe it will be of interest to researchers of Unsupervised RL.\n\n- The description of the article is very clear, and the introduction to related work is very specific.\n\n- I have basically read all the proofs of the theorems, which are well-written.\n\nThanks to the authors for putting in the effort in doing this work!\n\n[1] Eysenbach, Benjamin, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Sergey Levine. \"The information geometry of unsupervised reinforcement learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.02719 (2021)."

As the theoretical results can only show that all learned skills satisfy $p(z) > 0$ rather than WSEP can learn all $p(z) > 0$ skills, there is no direct evidence to suggest that WSEP can indeed find more skills than MISL (i.e., skills without maximum \u201cdistances\u201d). Can authors show that WSEP can find more skills or even all skills? I think empirical results or theoretical results even in simple cases will be really helpful.\n\n- All experiments are provided in the Appendix. It seems that providing the main experiments and analyses in the main text can help the readers to better understand this work.\n\n- What will happen if we change the W-distance to other distance metrics in PWSEP(i)? In my opinion, it seems that the proof of Thm 3.5 holds for any distance metric (owns Non-negativity, Symmetry, and Triangular Inequalities). Is it right? Or are there some special properties of W-distance necessary for proving Thm 3.5?\n\n- It's better to provide some proof sketch of theorems in the main text, like Thm 3.5."

For my understanding, the relationship: increasing LSEPIN results in lower WAC.\n    * Why measuring $\\min_z I(S;z)$ can be used to measure diversity and separability? I guess two features should be computed among skills, but the $\\min_z I(S;z)$ is just a mutual information for a single code.\n    * In LSEPIN, the metric measures the least skill code. I guess an abundant skill code may hurt the calculation. Isn't it problematic? How could you ensure that all the codes are meaningful in the computation of LSEPIN?\n    * WAC is measured with the worst state distribution. how this could be meaningful and practical? That is, why we need to measure the worst case adaptation? To the best of my knowledge,  skill adaptation is applied to the state distributions which are similar to the state distribution for the target skill. Therefore, the importance of $\\max_p$ part in WAC is not persuasive.\n    * Could you please additionally describe the necessity of symmetry and triangle inequality?\n    * What is the limitation of WSEP?\n    * Could this study can be combined with in-distribution and out-distribution perspective of task adaptations?\n\n[Overall]\nAlthough the authors conducted several theoretical derivations and analysis, the choice of metrics and the relationship between them have little meaning. Mostly because the task adaptation is might assume close state distribution $p$ for a skill $p(s|z)$. However, the authors study the worst-case adaptation. Additionally, the organization of the paper is not well constructed and hard to follow.*"

This work analyzes the mutual information-based skill learning paradigm with a focus on downstream task adaptability via worst-case adaptation cost.
