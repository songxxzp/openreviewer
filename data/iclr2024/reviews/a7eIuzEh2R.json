Extensive filtering and human examination are applied to ensure the data quality. Chain-of-Thoughts and prompt engineering are considered for LLMs. A range of latest LLMs including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Llama-2, and RWKV are evaluated accordingly to the success rate of the models in responding to the destination and route finding questions. Experiments show that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieve the best results while still performing poorly on hard questions and occasionally hallucinate nonexistent locations or edges. Analysis also demonstrates that LLMs with better mapping and navigation capabilities can better solve relevant downstream tasks, suggesting potential in addressing other embodied navigation tasks."

                "value": "Investigating the mapping and navigation capabilities of LLMs is an emergent and practical problem in embodied AI. As a researcher in this field, I am aware that extensive efforts have been devoted to understand and reason about the 3D space, which can greatly facilitate many functions such as explainable localization, path planning, and human intervention in agent navigation. As a result, I am very happy to see the benchmark proposed in this paper which I believe can benefit relevant research. In particular,\n- The MANGO dataset is large, it is of an appropriate complexity and suitable for evaluating the LLMs; the selected mazes have clear and traversable structures and the walkthrough are described by rich texts, the spatial positions and agent's actions are nicely integrated, and the proposed destination and route finding questions are clear and effective to reflect the LLMs understanding and reasoning.\n- The proposed data has been carefully filtered and examed, especially with the help of human annotators, to ensure the accuracy of text descriptions/questions and traversable paths.\n- Dataset statistics, examples, and visualizations are clearly presented in this paper.\n\nBesides, this paper benchmarks the most recent (and popular) LLMs including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-2, and RWKV on MANGO, and performs comprehensive analyses on their resulting success/failure cases. \n- Important questions such as \"what makes those mazes challenging?\" are nicely investigated through quantifying factors such as number of locations and number of imputed edges, showing valuable insights of the LLMs understanding.\n- Critical issues such as \"LLMs occasionally hallucinate nonexistent locations or edges\" and \"non-GPT models with careful prompt tuning still suffer high chance of failing\" have been found, which might guide and inspire future relevant research.\n- It was good to see the experiments in Section 3.4 about evaluation on a downstream navigation task - a relatively simple case but it is a nice start (can be improved, consider how it might link to practical navigation in the real-world). \n\nOverall, this paper was an enjoyable read to me. It is well-motivated, it is technically sound, it introduces a novel and useful benchmark. The paper is also very nicely-written, to me, almost all information are clearly presented."

This paper does not discuss any limitation and it is unclear how MANGO can be extended to more practical scenarios in the future."

                "value": "Please address my concerns mentioned in the Weaknesses.\n\nSome questions below are not critical to my evaluation. \n1. Section 2.2 and Appendix: I might overlooked this somewhere but I didn't find clear explanation on why slightly different data is applied to evaluate different LLMs?\n2. Apart from the proposed metrics for DF and RF, do the authors think some navigation-oriented measurement might be helpful? e.g., Success weight by Path Length (SPL) (On Evaluation of Embodied Navigation Agents. Anderson et al., 2018).\n3. Any results on experimenting with different prompts for the LLMs? And any insight on how to write those prompts?\n4. The results shown in Tables are from a single-run of the LLMs or from multiple runs and averaged?\n\nFor the others, instead of just responding Yes/No, I hope the authors can share their thoughts that might help further improve this paper.\n1. The authors mentioned the drawbacks of using unique IDs for locations (e.g., L01, L02, L03, ...), but it is important in real world because sometimes a space is hard to label with a clear name or there might be many same type of rooms in a building. I wonder how would the results change if IDs instead of names are used in the experiments. I also wonder some commonsense might help in practical navigation (e.g., a kitchen is likely to be on the first floor next to the living room) so a clear name might be helpful.\n2. The walkthougt contains detailed descriptions of the observations at each location, how would the results change if those descriptions are removed?\n3. Many large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) (e.g., the lastest GPT-4V) have been considered in addressing mapping and navigation problems, with egocentric image or top-dowm map inputs the models have very rich and less ambiguous information than only describing the world with language. I wonder how would VLMs impact the research presented in this paper.\n4. What about tunning LLMs on MANGO, e.g., using adaptor for low compute cost, would the results become much better?"

The simplicity of the current dataset means it could be solved by an agent translating natural language into <source, path, destination> triples, then using code or search libraries. The natural language is generated by patterns, making natural language understanding easy. This paper may have limited research impact, as future studies might follow the path of the GSM8K dataset, using methods such as PAL or LLMs with code interpreters as tools."

While the experiments in the paper do demonstrate that the task is challenging for LLMs, it is unclear for me how the proposed benchmark differs from all other datasets in the literature.

Would it work to use pure synthetic data, similar to how some of the symbolic reasoning datasets such as SCAN are created.\n    2. How this compares to datasets used in embodied AI and NL navigation such ALFRED?\n    4. Does the dataset reveal strength/weakness of the LLMs that is overlooked on other datasets?\n2. The authors conduct extensive experiments on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 which is very helpful. However, instead of focusing on models that already perform good, I feel the paper could benefit from more experiments on:\n    1. Why the other models perform much worse than GPT models, although they have demonstrated great performance on other tasks.\n    2. Why for models like RWKV and LLAMA the size does not seems to affect the performance much.\n    3. Are specific model designs, such as attention, position embedding, instruction tuning, affect the performance?\n3. In the paper the LLMs are prompted to directly generate the solution, with small amount of COT reasoning. This is actually different from how human solve the task, where oftentimes we need to parse the walkthrough and draw the map first. This is also how many embodied agent/NL navigation works have built up the system. I would expect a baseline on this direction to have much better performance."
