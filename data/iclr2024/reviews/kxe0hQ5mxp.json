I think any proposal of a radically new (and here I mean the symmetry aspect) activation function calls for additional evaluations of the utility of the proposed activation function under normal (all data available) conditions, just to convince the reader that we are not loosing much by using the new activation function.  \n\nAlso, feels like increase of sparsity of the gradient will have severe effect on learning dynamics in very deep networks - after all, there is a reason why we use ReLU and not sigmoid.  Perhaps trade off between depth (can I still adjust early layers) and forgetting (can I remember previous training samples) is inevitable.\n\nThis is not a significant issue, but while the \"Little Prince\" reference is cute, I don't find the name \"elephant\" for the proposed activation function appropriate - the shape of that function looks nothing like Exupery's elephant inside a boa... and I think the point of the function is the sparsity of its gradient, not the shape of the function itself...which still doesn't has nothing to do with an elephant."

While I like the fact that we can control the width and steepness of the elephant function for the fine tuning of network's plasticity, it seems that one fixed value of d for the entire network might be not appropriate.  Perhaps different tuning at different layers?  Also, it seems that for continual learning setting different d at different time of training might be appropriate.  Any thoughts on this?\n\nRemark 4.2 should the  \"that\" be \"if\"?\n\nConcept of 1-sparse and 1/2 sparse...I am not quite getting it - perhaps a bit more explanation is in order.\n\nCan these \"elephant\" activation networks, in principle (i.e. not in a continual learning scenario), achieve same generalisation as equivalent ReLU networks?"

It is a good problem and sparsity has been called out in some of the earliest continual learning papers in the deep learning era as a good inductive bias for continual learning, e.g., Kemker et al. (AAAI 2018).\n\nThe paper presents theoretical analysis to demonstrate that sparse representations alone cannot mitigate forgetting in non-linear approximations. They discover that both sparse representations and gradients are essential to mitigate forgetting in continual learning.\n\nIt introduces a new class of activation function to enforce sparsity for both representations and gradients to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. And, it provides formal proof that both elephant activation and its gradients are sparse functions.\n\nVarious networks with elephant activation (EMLP, ECNN) demonstrate better performance than their counterparts with classical activations as well as sparse neural networks (sparse representation only) in regression, class incremental learning and reinforcement learning tasks."

However, it is unknown how ENNs generalize to other performant algorithms e.g., rehearsal based methods. It is unclear if ENNs\u2019 efficacy is specific to the particular non-rehearsal settings (Sec. 5.2)  or not!\n\nBesides MLP and CNN, efficacy of elephant activation with ViTs is unexplored and necessary to verify its generality.\n\nLack of experiments on high dimensional and large scale datasets e.g., ImageNet-1K. Also it is unclear how ENNs perform in other data orderings e.g., IID (classes revisit) besides class-IL which is an extreme edge case. An ideal continual learner should be robust to any data orderings including class-IL and IID. Continual learning is about knowledge accumulation, and it conflates the test with an adversarial distribution with the goal.\n\nIt is unclear if elephant activation increases computational and/or memory overheads or not compared to commonly used activation functions in terms of learning efficiency (updates).\n\nA common practice in measuring catastrophic forgetting is to compare continual learner with an offline learner (jointly trained on all data) given that they both use the same architecture. Therefore, a more precise difference between continual learner and offline learner (i.e., forgetting) can be made when they both use elephant neural networks e.g., EMLPs or ECNNs. Currently, it is missing in the paper as offline learner\u2019s performance is not mentioned.\n\nThe way the main text is written leads to an understanding that elephant activations are used in all layers replacing classical activations. However, surprisingly, it is written in supplemental material (Sec. C) that in all cases, elephant activations are only used in the last hidden layer whereas all other layers have classical activations. It is mentioned in the footnote that replacing all activations with elephant activations hurts performance. This highly undermines this paper\u2019s core contributions and efficacy of the proposed method. These limitations should be mentioned and highlighted in the main paper. Otherwise readers will be highly misled if they read the main text.\n\nIt is unclear whether the performance gain originates from elephant activations or not. More experimental verification is required to establish that elephant activation mainly reduces forgetting. It is also unclear how sufficient sparsity to tackle forgetting is enforced with limited use of elephant activations."

Can authors report their task matrix? Currently I am not sure what benefit elephant activation offers beside sparsity that would potentially overcome forgetting.\n\nEmpirical evaluation of activation function is already done by goodfellow in 2013, so it is not new that sparsity alone cannot solve forgetting. One should also compare model\u2019s with k-winner take all activation function, since that also adds sparsity. Can author report how elephant performs compared to K-WTA?\nIt would have been interesting to show how your model works with SoTA continual learning systems such as Gdumb, A-GEM, iCARL etc, current experiments are limited to shallow model and thus it is unclear how would model work with deeper structure.\n\nWhat is the level of sparsity achieved by the network using proposed activation function?
