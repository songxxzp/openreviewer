Although the authors later say that $P$ will always be a $G$-homogeneous space (so the $G$-action on $P$ is essential an action on the quotient space), it would be much better to state this assumption in the beginning.\n5. On page 4, the authors say $H = SO(n)$ is abelian. Is this the case for $n\\ge 3$?\n6. The theory seems to apply only to $H = GL^+(n, R)$ or $H = SL(n, R)$.

The advantage of this approach over MacDonald et al 2022 is not made sufficiently clear, since both approaches can also handle Lie groups with non-surjective exponential maps. \n3. The related work is missing at least two important papers on Lie group equivariance: \u201cA Practical Method for Constructing Equivariant Multilayer Perceptrons for Arbitrary Matrix Groups\u201d by Finzi et al 2021, and \u201cLorentz Group Equivariant Neural Network for Particle Physics\u201d by Bogatskiy et al 2020. It would be important to compare to these papers (both in theory, in terms of the Lie groups and input/output representations to which they apply, and in the experiments), since they are exactly equivariant. \n4. To a similar point, this method is only approximately equivariant (due to the sampling in the integral computation), rather than exactly equivariant. This could be expressed more clearly in the introduction of the paper. It would also be helpful to have computational tests of equivariance, which assess to what degree the learned network is actually equivariant after integration error. \n5. The paper\u2019s presentation could be significantly improved. In addition to typos, some of which are noted below, the writing leaves something to be desired overall. For example, the main body of the paper is very dense in mathematical background and details. It would be helpful to clearly and concisely express the main ideas of the paper earlier on and to give only the important intuitions, and to defer many such details to later in the paper or the appendix.\n6. Enforcing equivariance to Lie groups with non-surjective exponential maps could be much better motivated \u2014 applications are not discussed very often, and the datasets used are synthetic (e.g. affine transformations of MNIST).

I am therefore confused how e.g. equation 13, and really all the integrals, are well-defined without additional assumptions on the bounds of integration or the decay of the function being integrated.\n2. Could the authors elaborate on the primary advantages of this integration method over that of MacDonald et al 2022, which also handles the case of Lie groups with non-surjective exponential maps? The related work mentions memory requirements, but it is not clear to me how this method circumvents these issues (or what the precise issues are).\n3. Assuming the main advantage over MacDonald et al 2022 is in memory requirements, why then do the authors think that MacDonald et al had slightly worse performance in the experiments? \n4. The papers by Finzi et al and Bogatskiy et al, noted under \u201cweaknesses\u201d above, are not integration methods. Are they suited for the input and output representations that this task considers? If so, can the authors compare to these methods as well?\n5. At the top of page 8, the authors note that they sample the translation factor from $[-1,1]^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$. How is this justified, when the integral is defined over all of $\\mathbb{R}^n$? Doesn\u2019t this induce some error, which is compounded in subsequent layers?\nIs this construction universal?

The problem is that Gconv is an integral over the group, which is often approximated by discrete sampling done using the exp map. When the exp map is not surjective, we can't rely on it to get good coverage in the sampling.\nTo mitigate this, this paper suggests to find a decomposition of the group in the form $G=PK$ such that the integration (Haar) measure over the group also factorizes $d\\mu_G = d\\mu_P d\\mu_K \\delta(\\cdot)$. In certain cases, such as the Affine group, this decomposition can yield familiar subgroups for which we have either a surjective exp (e.g. $SO(n)$) or efficient sampling strategies (e.g. diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$). \nAfter deriving the theory behind such decomposition, they introduce a Monte Carlo sampling scheme for it.

                "value": "1. How are methods relying on irreps affected by the expm not being surjective? Does it matter in those cases? \n2. For the Haar measures to factorize to $\\mu_K \\otimes \\mu_P$, do we need $G=PK$ or semidirect or direct product? A number of different decompositions are used in 4.1 and 4.2 and the requirements are not fully clear. \n3. I see that $G=PK$ can be done when $P$ or $K$ is a normal subgroup. In the $SL(n)$ to $\\mathrm{SPos} \\times SO(n)$, is $SO(n)$, is one of the factors also a normal subgroup? \n4. Even when expm is not surjective, the product of multiple $g_i = \\mathrm{expm}(X_i)$ can produce any arbitrary group element, as I understand it. Doesn't this mean that multi-layer Gconv using expm should in principle be sufficient to get good sample coverage on the group? In other words, is your decomposition really necessary?"

In an earlier work which makes use of the Lie algebra to construct the kernels, when the exponential map is not surjective, the log map is only applicable around the identity in the lie algebra, and is thus restrictive. Furthermore, this method has exponential memory complexity in the group dimension. The focus of the paper is two such groups: $GL^+(n,\\mathbb{R})$ and $SL(n,\\mathbb{R})$. The key idea is to decompose these groups into subgroups and submanifolds where sampling the group elements is easier and well defined. Experiments on small standard datasets shows improvements over earlier methods."

While the Haar measure for such non-compact groups is ill-defined, the approach proposes to work with the decomposition of these groups into factors that have well-behaved Haar measures. Factorizing the convolution integral enables the computation of group equivariant convolutions on these groups. By using results from random matrix theory to efficiently sample elements of these groups, the authors propose an efficient way to compute these integrals via Monte Carlo (MC) integration. This results in an order of magnitude improvement in the number of samples needed for a converged integral. The method is tested on two image classification tasks under affine and homographic transformations. In both benchmarks, the method is shown to outperform previous approaches."

In particular, methods that rely on approximating integrals over groups will always be approximately equivariant. While increasing the number of samples could reduce this error below floating-point precision, such an analysis is not present in the paper. A curve illustrating the equivariance error as a function of the number of Monte Carlo samples would be pertinent in this context. Although sizeable equivariance errors might be manageable in the context of image classification tasks, this is not the case for all types of application tasks where group convolutions are relevant. Specifically, in physics simulations, equivariance errors are related to the non-conservation of physical quantities. The proposed approach should be contrasted with approaches that use linear operators to evaluate the group integral, such as [1] and [2], which are exactly equivariant (even for non-compact groups) but require large tensorial operations (for [1]) or ad hoc representation theory for each group (for [2]). I encourage the authors to briefly discuss these points in the text and add an analysis of numerical stability in the form of a plot to the appendix.\n\n- In the paper, only the symmetrization to the canonical group action is explicitly mentioned. Extending the matrix elements to other finite-dimensional group representations should be straightforward, provided that the correct basis is determined.

Do you think it would be possible to obtain an explicit bound on the equivariance error as a function of the number of Monte Carlo samples, the sizes of the factors in the group decomposition, and the size of the representation? To be more precise, I am looking for something akin to this bound: $|| \\int_{H} \\int_{K} f(\\rho(h) \\rho(k) \\cdot x) d\\mu_{H}(\\rho(h)) d\\mu_{K}(\\rho(k)) - \\frac{V}{N} \\sum_{i} f(\\rho(h_{i}) \\rho(k_{i}) \\cdot x), \\rho(h_{i}) \\sim \\mu_{H}, \\rho(k_{i}) \\sim \\mu_{K}|| \\leq f(N, dim(\\rho), dim(H), dim(K) )$\nUsing that, one could ask what kind of factorization gives the best bound."
