DP federated learning algorithm based on the Bayesian approach has been proposed. At each round, each sampled client runs a local optimizer to update her own model, and then the client privately reports the output of the local NN on the alignment dataset (AD).

The local optimization then approximates the local posterior via variational inference. Finally, the model outputs from the new local model are shared to the server.

Let me elaborate,\n\nThe idea of aggregating scores on a public dataset instead of model weights was presented in [1] in 2019 although for training a global model. Using a Bayesian view for modelling the heterogeneity problem in FL through learning a prior was studied in [2,3,4]. Especially, [2,4] should be compared to in details in terms of modelling, note [4] also uses DP for enhancing privacy. The idea of collaborating resource and data heterogenous clients is presented in the paper as a novel contribution, however, [1,5] already did it (again there is no comparison to those methods). \n\nOverall, it is not clear what is the contribution of the paper over those papers since they are not mentioned in the related works. \n\n- Public unlabeled dataset is seen as a mild assumption. But, imagine planting this additional dataset to millions of devices, this can introduce inefficiencies in the system and waste client's precious resources.\n\n- Generating $\\Phi^{corrected}$ requires tuning an additional hyper-parameter $\\gamma$ which further introduces inefficiency, since each client might need to do validation runs to tune it. \n\n- There are several unclear points to me in the experiments. For instance what is the overall privacy budget for your DP method and DP-FedAvg, it says epsilon per round is smaller than 0.1 but what is the exact budgets?\n\n- The majority of the experiments in the main text is done using 20 clients. It is not clear to me if the performance difference will persist in higher client regime, which is more realistic for FL.\n\n- There is no comparison to local only training, this is a critical point.\n\n- The supplementary material does not include code. \n\n[1] Li et al., FedMD: Heterogenous Federated Learning via Model Distillation, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.03581.pdf\n\n[2] Kotelevskii et al., FedPop: A Bayesian Approach for Personalised Federated Learning, \n https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/395409679270591fd2a70abc694cf5a1-Abstract-Conference.html\n\n[3] Chen et al., Self-Aware Personalized Federated Learning \n, https://openreview.net/forum?id=EqJ5_hZSqgy\n\n[4] Ozkara et al., A Statistical Framework for Personalized Federated Learning and Estimation: Theory, Algorithms, and Privacy, https://openreview.net/forum?id=FUiDMCr_W4o\n\n[5] Ozkara et al., QuPeD: Quantized Personalization via Distillation with Applications to Federated Learning,  https://openreview.net/forum?id=Yowoe1scJOD"
