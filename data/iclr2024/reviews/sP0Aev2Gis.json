This pre-trained language model, named G2PTL, can improve the performance of downstream tasks such as address entity extraction, address normalization, as well as geolocation coding and pick-up estimation time of arrival. The contributions for this paper are as follows:\n1. It pre-trained a large language model for addresses using delivery information. There were similar models in previous literature but this proposed model is optimized for tasks related to logistics and delivery. \n2. In pre-training phase, the authors proposed a novel method to use both graphical information as well as text information. In specific, the Graphormer is used to encode both the routing and pairwise distance between addresses, while the Transformer is used to encode the semantic information in address text as well as node degree and position information. Then a new transformer is used to merge two sides of information together. \nThe authors have shown the performance improvement using this pre-trained language models and they also showed the importance of pre-training tasks such as graph learning and geocoding to the performance improvement of the pre-trained models."

                "value": "The strength of this paper is as below:\n1. The proposed pre-trained LM for delivery address is a domain specific language models. Unlike the generic LM, this model focuses on optimizing the performance of logistic and delivery related tasks. For that reason, it is not satisfactory of the semantic text information in the address but also requiring additional knowledge on the relationship between addresses in the geographical map. This information including the neighborhood information from both distance perspective and the routing perspective. Thus, it is natural to consider both of them during the pre-training. \n2. The proposed pre-training model for delivery address used multi-modal (text + graph) information in the pre-training phase. Allowing the learned embedding to capture both semantic similarity and the geographical similarity between addresses. This makes a lot of senses since in practice, many similar worded addresses are actually very far away from distance point of view thus is not optimized to be included in the delivery route. \n3. The design of heterogenous graph using delivery route as well as AOI Co-locate information is very interesting. It makes sense considering that the delivery system and courier would optimize their route to prioritize addresses in a closer neighborhood and to set the delivery priority accordingly. Building a graph using such information would naturally include geographical neighborhood information which is better than just geo-encoding since a closer direct distance of two addresses may take a long time to travel due to geographical barriers. \n4. This paper has well demonstrated the strength of specialized LM in domain specific tasks. In many special domains, pre-training LM is more useful than fine-tuning existing ones given enough resources. The experiments are well written and the result is significant."

It is unclear given the graphical information encoded during the pre-training phase, if the proposed model G2PTL can be used to perform graph-related tasks such as link prediction and clustering. The proposed downstream tasks focus on text related tasks only. It is likely due to non-symmetric roles that the graph and the text plays for the design of the model. We would like to see the performance of the graph-related downstream tasks such as link-prediction, node classification based on fine-tuning of this model. \n2. This paper used less than 100K samples in the pre-training. It is unclear how the performance of the model scale with the sample size. Since both graph and text are used in the training, it is interesting to know if the model can still train with just text information\n3. The inference for the model may need to have completed graph. This is a limitation for its widely use since most of applications do not have a complete graph at hands for inference."

From the model design, it seems that the graphomer is used in the model, thus I would expect edge and node input for the model? If the task is just address normalization without graph input, can we still use this model?\n2. Do we need to have a correct geographical map before using the proposed model in real life? What if the map is incorrect? How robustness of this model when the graphical information in inference time is noisy? \n3. How large the graph do we need to prepare before using this model for address normalization? Do we need to have a global map or local map? If only local maps are used, is it possible that this method cannot learn the address similarity beyond a local region?"
