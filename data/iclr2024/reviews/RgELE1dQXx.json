The introduction part is also particularly short with the contribution statements even deferred after the related work section. I would strongly encourage the authors to expand the introduction with more detailed explanations and more intuitions. \n\n2. I think the \"**Theoretical reinforcement learning**\" section should be expanded a bit, e.g., to be an independent background section. I think this part is the most relevant literature. It would be better if the paper could spend more texts explaining the connection and differences between the existing literature and the current work from a more technical perspective. \n\n3. It is strange to me that the convergence bounds are introduced even before the algorithms. This makes it difficult for the readers to follow the insights.\n\n4. It is so tough for me to fully follow section 4.2. Equation (5) looks like a magical number to me and I have no idea how it is derived and why such a structure helps improve the bound from reward-free learning. I'm not a theoretical person. Carefully checking every detail of the proof is out of my capacity, so it would be great for me if the paper could explain well the insights of why the structure helps improve the bound for an outsider. \n\n5. It is stated in the experiment section that two testbeds are considered, including the Flabby Bird domain and the Car Driving domain. However, I cannot find the Car Driving results."

The dependence on $S$ is typically more important than $H$ in the reinforcement learning problem. As claimed by the authors, the sample complexity bound for Algorithm 3 is sharper in the dependence on S than for Algorithm 1. But $\\mathcal{E}_2$ should be a harder problem than $\\mathcal{E}_1$, and thus the sample complexity bound for $\\mathcal{E}_1$ is expected to be better. Can the authors discuss why there is such a gap and whether it is possible to modify Algorithm 1 to have a better sample complexity bound matching the one for Algorithm 3 in terms of $S$?\n\n(2) Can the authors point out which part of the supplement is for the theorem and the corresponding proof of Algorithm 3? It appears not explicitly presented in the paper, although the authors have shown its sample complexity result in the main text.\n\n(3) Eq.(1) is not clearly explained, especially the third case in Eq.(1).

The authors use this abstraction to study the setting of a human taking advice from a machine in order to perform better on a decision-making task. Crucially, this MDP assumes the human (i.e. the static policy that receives machine advice) only follows the advice (i.e. a recommended action) with a probability $\\theta$ per state. The paper then 1. introduces UCB-based algorithms to solve the case where the environment dynamics and human policy are know, but $\\theta$ is unknown, and 2. adapts reward-free exploration methods to solve the case where the dynamics and advice-taking policy are additionally unknown, whereby the MDP is modeled as a CMDP. The experiments focus on a toy environment based on Flappy Bird and two toy, hard-coded policies (\"Greedy\" and \"Fixed\"). In this latter setting, the authors show their reward-free expoloration method, RFE-$\\beta$ can successfully provide advice to improve the performance of the two fixed policies."

                "value": "While this paper studies an important topic, the paper should be improved before acceptance to a top-tier conference like ICLR:\n- The experimental setting is extremely simplistic. The Flappy Bird MDP effectively consists of just 2 actions (up or down). The exact layout of MDP also appears fixed. Likewise, the advice-taking policies are fixed as two hard-coded policies. Effectively, the problem then reduces to learning a policy to solve 2 static MDPs with very small action spaces. Ideally the study can look at Flappy Bird under a procedurally-generated setting as well as look at other environments with higher-dimensional observation and action spaces.\n- It would also be ideal to include an environment with continuous action spaces.\n- The experimental setting also buckets all states into 2 coarse groupings of adherence levels for the advice-taking policy. In practice, the adherence levels are likely more complex and also time-varying. It would improve the paper to include experiments with a co-adapting advice-taking policy.\n- In extending this work to higher-dimensional environments, the authors should consider comparing their approaches to existing deep RL methods for exploration [1,2] as baselines.\n\n**Minor comments**\n- In the related works section, the authors should include citations to the line of works studying human-AI cooperation in Hanabi: \n    - Bard, Nolan, et al. \"The hanabi challenge: A new frontier for ai research.\" Artificial Intelligence 280 (2020): 103216.\n    - Foerster, Jakob, et al. \"Bayesian action decoder for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
