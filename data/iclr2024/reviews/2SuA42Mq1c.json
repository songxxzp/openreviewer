The overarching claim of a \u201cuniversal and fair\u201d benchmark appears difficult to substantiate, as representation from five domains necessarily remains a small subset of possible image anomaly cases in medicine. The degree of fairness regarding domain selection might be further justified. For example, thin structures appear relatively less represented.\n2. As raised in the Introduction, a common practical concern for anomaly detection in the medical domain is when some (more-common) disease classes are known and labelled/annotated, but other rarer classes not in the initially known set of diseases may occur. Some analysis of such tasks might thus be relevant.\n3. A number of minor spelling/grammatical errors might be addressed, e.g. \u201ca fair comparing among these methods\u201d, \u201cwell-structure, easy-use codebase\u201d, \u201csamll tumor localization\u201d, \u201clarge pre-train models\u201d, etc."

It organizes six datasets from five different medical domains, ensuring diversity and representation of real-world medical scenarios. \n\nThe paper is clear in its presentation. It is well-structured and provides detailed information about the benchmark, including the datasets, evaluation metrics, and algorithms used.\n\nThe benchmark is very importance for the field of anomaly detection in medical imaging. Medical imaging have a crucial role in diagnosing / monitoring various diseases. A standard benchmark can lead to the development of more reliable and robust AD methods, ultimately benefiting healthcare and patient outcomes.\n\nThe presence of Table 3, which provides insights into both the inference times and the performance of the AD models, is interesting as it not only facilitates a more robust comparison of the models but also helps researchers when assessing the efficiency of their proposed methodologies in the context of anomaly detection."

Detailed documentation and code accessibility are essential for other researchers to replicate and extend the experiments.\n\nThe paper acknowledges that most of the data used in the benchmark is collected in advanced countries, which may introduce geographical and sampling biases. This limitation could potentially affect the generalizability of the benchmark to a broader range of medical imaging scenarios. To address this, the paper could suggest ways to mitigate these biases.\n\nThe paper mentions that the hyperparameter settings for the evaluated algorithms were based on the original works, and not all hyperparameters achieved their optimal values for specific datasets. This could potentially lead to suboptimal performance for some algorithms. To address this, the paper could provide recommendations or guidelines for tuning hyperparameters to improve the performance of the AD algorithms on the benchmark datasets. This would make the benchmark more valuable.\n\nIn addition to the mentioned quantitative metrics, incorporating qualitative analysis and insights from medical professionals regarding the benchmark's practical applicability in real-world anomaly detection scenarios would enhance its credibility and utility."
