                "value": "Precipitation forecasting holds significant scientific and societal value. While data-driven techniques are increasingly popular in addressing forecasting challenges, they struggle with accurately representing the physics involved. Marrying AI post-processing with established Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) methods can bolster forecast accuracy. Yet, predicting heavy rainfall remains a hurdle, given uneven precipitation data and intricate meteorological variable interplays. This study presents the PostRainBench, a robust NWP post-processing benchmark comprising three datasets for enhanced precipitation forecasting. We introduce CAMT, a Channel Attention Enhanced Multi-task Learning framework, integrated with a tailored weighted loss function. This framework seamlessly merges with various backbones. Tests on our benchmark indicate that CAMT surpasses existing methods by notable margins, especially under extreme rainfall conditions. Significantly, our model is the pioneering deep learning tool that outdoes traditional NWP methods in predicting intense rain, showcasing its immense promise in mitigating extreme weather implications."

However, to my knowledge, several studies have already ventured into this area, as evidenced by references [1-3]. I suggest the authors review the accuracy of this statement and make appropriate amendments.\n\n2. In my perspective, the proposed model in this paper seems to lack innovation, appearing to be a combination of the swinTransformer and unet. This raises concerns about the reproducibility of the experimental results. Could the authors provide more details or rationale to support their design choices?\n\n3. The selected baselines in the paper don't appear comprehensive. For instance, recent significant works in the relevant field, such as OpenSTL[4] and Fourcastnet[5], are not considered. I would recommend the authors to include these for comparison.\n\n\n[1] Zhang, Yuchen, et al. \"Skilful nowcasting of extreme precipitation with NowcastNet.\" *Nature* 619, no. 7970 (2023): 526-532.\n\n[2] Bi, Kaifeng, et al. \"Pangu-weather: A 3d high-resolution model for fast and accurate global weather forecast.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.02556* (2022).\n\n[3] Chen, Kang, et al. \"FengWu: Pushing the Skillful Global Medium-range Weather Forecast beyond 10 Days Lead.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.02948* (2023).\n\n[4] Tan, Cheng, et al. \"OpenSTL: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.11249* (2023).\n\n[5] Pathak, Jaideep, et al. \"Fourcastnet: A global data-driven high-resolution weather model using adaptive fourier neural operators.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.11214* (2022)."
