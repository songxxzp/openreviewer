There is a gap between these two. \n3.\tThe proposed method involves with the implicit representation of 3D cube data. The differences with 3D reconstruction and video super resolution should be clarified. \n4.\tIn this paper, the task is decoupled into two subtasks: the implicit representation of spatial domain and spectral domain. There are many solutions for the former subtask. It is trivial. For the latter one, it seems that the latent codes for different sampling wavelengths in an interval are simply weighted by SRF. \n5.\tAlthough the paper aims to reconstruct high-resolution images without knowing the PSF and SRF, the training data is still generated with known PSF and SRF. This means the network may not work with unknown PSF and SRF. Is it possible to deploy the method on real data?\n6.\tThe spectrum is extrapolated via the proposed method SSIF. Are the extrapolated HSIs with more spectrum more effective for downstream tasks?\n7.\tThe comparison methods should contain the methods designed for HSI resolution instead of many methods for RGB images, which may not consider the data properties.\n8.\tThe effectiveness for separate resolution tasks is not verified.\n9.\tThere are many typos and some illustrations are low quality for identification, such as Figure 3 and 8.\n10.\tThe reviewer concerns the IOU for each class and mIOU more."
