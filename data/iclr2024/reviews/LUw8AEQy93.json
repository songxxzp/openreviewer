                "value": "This paper focuses on the topic of segmentation foundation models (SFMs) and their potential in learning to segment various objects. SFMs, such as SEEM and SAM, are built upon the concept of \"Promptable Segmentation,\" which involves using a handcrafted prompt as input to obtain the desired segmentation mask.\n\nSFMs utilize two types of prompts: spatial prompts (e.g., points) and semantic prompts (e.g., texts). These prompts work together to guide SFMs in segmenting objects in downstream datasets. However, the process of acquiring suitable prompts for SFMs has not been extensively explored.\n\nTo address this gap, the authors of this paper analyze the architecture of SFMs and identify two challenges related to prompt learning. In response, they propose a method called spatial-semantic prompt learning (SSPrompt) that aims to learn effective semantic and spatial prompts for improved SFMs.\n\nSSPrompt introduces spatial prompt learning and semantic prompt learning techniques, which optimize spatial and semantic prompts directly in the embedding space. Additionally, the proposed approach selectively leverages the knowledge encoded in pre-trained prompt encoders.\n\nThe paper presents extensive experiments that demonstrate the superior performance of SSPrompt in image segmentation across multiple widely adopted datasets."
