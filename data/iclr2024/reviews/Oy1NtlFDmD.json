                "value": "The authors propose a sampling mechanism for Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to improve its efficiency on commodity accelerators. The GNN training for large graphs is inefficient due to the requirement for two sparse matrix multiplications in the forward and backward passes of the gradient descent. The authors made an observation that sampling the row-column pairs of the adjacency matrix using their norms (as suggested by previous works since they provide the most accurate numerical approximation) leads to an under-fitting problem. The authors instead suggest sampling the row-column pairs uniformly and using instance normalization to stabilize the training. The experimental results and comparison with previous work show promising results for efficiency gains while retaining similar accuracy as the original GNN."
