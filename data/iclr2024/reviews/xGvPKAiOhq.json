Gaussian matrices, is it possible to derive sharper or even asymptotically exact (in the sense of e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09660) results?\n\n2. Could the authors comment on how crucially the results rely on the \"linearity\" of the problem? Does it make sense to consider a \"generalized\" matrix sensing problem in which y_i = phi(<A_i, M^*>) for some non-linearity phi? This is somewhat motivated by other models with similar structures such as generalized linear models or single-index models. I guess the information exponent of phi or something like that will play a role in the convergence rate. \n\n3. In Sec 5, an accelerated method is proposed. In particular, step (5.1) should be executed once the iterates are sufficiently close to the optimum. But in practice, how can one verify this neighborhood condition? Note that Sigma is unknown. Please let me know if I missed something simple here. \n\n4. It seems that both the model and the algorithms are deterministic. What happens if the observations are noisy?\n\n5. It's claimed on top of page 6 that the results easily extend to the rectangular case. Could the authors state such results formally (even without formal proofs)? I'm curious to see how the results depend on the aspect ratio n_2 / n_1. In fact, if the matrices are extremely rectangular (e.g. n_2 / n_1 is growing or decaying), I actually doubt if such extensions are so straightforward. Thanks in advance for the clarification. \n\n6. Lemma G.1 assumes x, y are \"random vectors\". Are they actually independent and uniform over the sphere? For generic joint distribution, not much can be said about their angle. Please make the statement more precise. \n\nMinor notational/grammatical issues. \n1. The ground truth is interchangeably denoted by M^* or M^\\star. I suggest stick to M^\\star to avoid conflict with adjoint operator. \n\n2. In the title of Sec 1.2, where is the word \"symmetric\" repeated twice?\n\n3. Statement of Theorem 1.3: t-the iteration --> t-th iteration. \n\n3. Page 4: which we require it to be small --> which we require to be small.\n\n4.

The unexpected result is that the *symmetricity* versus *imbalance* plays a significant role.\n\nThe main \"positive\" result states that the over-parameterized gradient descent on $FG^T$ factorization is able to achieve linear convergence when the two components are imbalanced in the sense of the spectrum of $\\Delta = F^\\top F - G^\\top G$, and the specific convergence rate depends on this imbalance. The main \"negative\" result shows that there will always exist a positive measure of cases when symmetric parametrization $FF^\\top$ cannot have faster than sublinear convergence.\n\nThe work provides simple, but well explained numerical examples of small matrix sizes ($50 \\times 50, \\mathrm{rank} =3$) that clearly demonstrate this phenomenon.\n\nThe proofs take more than 30 pages in the appendices, they are technically involved and not easy to check in their entirety, but at first sight the result seems correct."

However, in the experiments in Figure 2, I do not see this initialization phase in Figure 2b. Instead, linear convergence is observed right from the start, even when a small initialization is used. I wonder why is this the case? For the asymmetric case, is the initialization phase much faster?\n\nAdditional experiments which i think should be nice: on the same plot, compare the convergence of asymmetric versus symmetric parameterization, using the same initialization. Also perform the experiment for different initialization scales. I think the authors should also plot convergence for ill-conditioned versus well-conditioned matrices, as GD with small initialization performs differently based on the eigenvalues. \n\nIn any case, i would like to see a more detailed comparison of symmetric versus asymmetric parameterization, even just using synthetic experiments."
