My main concern lies in that from my perspective, APT is highly similar to prefixing tuning[1-2],  which has already been verified effective for visual tasks in previous works [3-4]. Additionally, a similar reparameterization strategy for prompt tuning has already been explored in [5] (authors also DO NOT cite this method in the paper). In light of previous works, novelty and contribution of APT are substantially restricted.\n\n2. To compare with other baselines, it would be appreciated to include views (temporal and spatial ones) in the table for video models.\n\n3. As for efficient tuning on videos, it is important to not only ensure tunable parameters as few as possible but also consider keeping to low GFLOPS, which may also have great impacts on efficiency, training costs and application value. On that basis, APT may improve performance at the cost of high GFLOPS, e.g., APT-400 outperforms other PEFT methods in Table 5 while bringing about the most increase in GLOPS and in Table 6, AIM hits 66.4 with GFLOPS of 624 while APT-400 operates with the GFLOPS of 192.05*3*3 = 1728.45.  \n\n4.

Secondly, there have been numerous studies discussing the position of prompts in the vision transformer, with basic choices including Prompt Tuning (Pro-T) [1] and Prefix Tuning (Pre-T) [2]. The Pre-T technique has been widely used in existing computer vision methods, e.g., [3]. Is there any difference between the first technique of this paper and Prefix Tuning? \n\n[1] The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning, EMNLP 2021.\n\n[2] Prefix-Tuning: Optimizing Continuous Prompts for Generation, ACL 2021.\n\n[3] DualPrompt: Complementary Prompting for Rehearsal-free Continual Learning, ECCV 2022.\n\n2. The authors do not connect the techniques proposed in this paper and video. Why can these proposed techniques solve the special problem of prompt tuning in video applications? The performance of Pre-T is inherently better than that of Pro-T. Is the performance improvement derived from Pre-T itself or from solving the problem?\n\n3. There is no detailed analysis on how much parameter reduction is achieved compared to MLP-based reparameterization, nor any changes in performance.\n\n4. There should be a fine-grained control of variables for each model (GFLOPS and performance under fine-tuning different parametric quantities should be compared in a more granular way).\n\nIn conclusion, this paper is more similar to a technical report, rather than a research paper. It applies a widely used trick Prefix Tuning to prompt tuning in video-based applications, and treats it as the core contribution of this paper. More importantly, this paper lacks the analysis for the special problem in video-based applications (i.e., need many prompts) and lacks the insights to design their techniques for solving this special problem. Pre-T has inherently better performance than Pro-T, so the performance improvement comes from Pre-T technology itself or from solving the problem? In addition, regarding the second contribution, why do the authors not provide the comparison between their prompt reparameterization technique and existing prompt reparameterization techniques? I believe that this paper falls considerably short of the standard required for ICLR and, as such, I recommend rejection."

Can the authors provide more detailed analyses on GFLOPS and performance about their method compared to existing method? Figure 5 compares VPT and APT on GFLOPs, but I cannot find the performance comparison. Table 5 provides the comparison of different methods on GFLOPs and performance.
