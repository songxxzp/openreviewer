Dueling bandits is a variant of the standard multi-armed bandits problem, particularly well suited for practical applications, where at each round the algorithm selects two arms (also called items) to play and receives receives feedback that expresses which of the two items was preferred, As this preferences don't necessarily imply the existence of a unique ranking between the arms, the authors of the papers consider the Borda score (which is the average win rate against all arms) as the measure used to define the regret.\nThe goal of this work is to take advantage of the side information given by the linear bandit structure to learn faster. \n\nThe first contribution of the paper is a well detailed lower bound proof, which shows that the difficulty of the problem scales as $d^{2/3}T^{2/3}$, where $T$  is the time horizon and $d$ is the dimension of the contextual vectors.\nThey then present a simple Explore then commit strategy that achieves near optimal performance for the stochastic version of the problem, and a variation of the EXP3 algorithm that also achieves near optimal (and optimal rate when the number of arms is of order $2^d$). \nFinally, they present experiments on both generated and real world datasets showing that the presented algorithms can successfully use the linear structure of the problem to outperform the all the baselines."

Specifically, the most important result presented in this paper is the lower bound, which is well detailed.\n\nThis first result is crucial to justify that the proposed algorithms, that shine by their simplicity, are sufficient for the problem at hand. I find the dual explore structure of the ETC algorithm fairly interesting: in the first part, the exploration is uniform to initialize correctly the algorithm, but then the exploration is refined to be tuned according to the precision required for each pairs of arms. The authors derive near optimal high probability bounds for this algorithm, which are stronger guarantees compared to results holding in expectation.\n\nThe second algorithm builds upon the very standard EXP3 algorithm, and its DEXP3 variant for dueling bandits. This algorithm is more robust, as it holds for the adversarial version of the problem, which is more challenging. Interestingly, the proposed bound is actually tight when the number of arms is exponential in the dimension of the contextual vector, and in the experiments, BEXP3 outperforms its ETC counterpart.\n\nIt is also appreciated that the authors discuss how to modify the algorithms to adapt for small number of arms as well as infinite number of arm, and it is worth noting that the paper is particularly well written, with details like ensuring that all notations are clearly defined and visual representations of the lower bound."

The probability model adopted encompasses a generalized linear model with an unknown parameter $\\theta^*\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ for the stochastic setting and linear model with $\\theta_t$ for the adversarial setting. Regret is assessed through the Borda score, defined as the average winning probability of an arm over the other arms.\n\nThe authors establish a lower bound for both the stochastic and adversarial settings. For the stochastic setting, they introduce an algorithm based on ETC, tightly matching the lower bound concerning T and d. In the adversarial setting, they propose the BEXP3 algorithm based on EXP3, achieving regret of (dlog K)^{1/3}T^{2/3}. The paper concludes with a demonstration of the proposed algorithms using synthetic and real-world datasets."

It is somewhat debatable in the literature which setting is preferable. In my opinion, since the Borda setting relies on pure exploration tactics (e.g., explore-then-commit in stochastic setting or EXP3 with T^{-1/3} exploration in adversarial setting), it is very amenable to the generalizing to this GLM model without hassle. Thus, I think the regret upper bounds in this paper are not surprising. The stochastic BETC-GLM regret bound seems to follow almost immediately from well-known sample complexity bounds for optimal design, where estimation of $\\theta^*$ is completely decoupled from regret. Meanwhile, the adversarial regret bound for BEXP3 seems to be identical to that of DEXP3 in Saha et al., 2021 except for plugging in slightly different variance bounds at the end. \nTo contrast, in the Condorcet setting, where pure exploration is innapropriate to target $\\sqrt{T}$ reget, one would have had to carefully decouple estimation of $\\theta^*$ and regret minimization. So, I think the Condorcet setting would have been more technically interesting to study.\n* Alternatively, it would have been more interesting to study instance-dependent regret rates (e.g., those appearing in Jamieson et al., 2015) as it's more unclear to me how those would behave for GLM dueling bandits.\n* The adversarial regret upper bound seems to only be able to get the $(d\\log(K))^{1/3}$ dependence and not the $d^{2/3}$ dependence if $K \\gg 2^d$ because there is an unavoidable $\\log(K)$ appearing in the EXP3 analysis. Therefore, it is not necessarily optimal in all regimes. \n* As is the case for generalized linear MAB, there is a mysterious dependence on $\\kappa^{-1}$ in the regret upper bounds. It is unclear to me if this dependence is optimal and calls into question how realistic this regret bound can be."

This seems a little confusing to me because the constructed environments seem to be stochastic and not adversarial. Can the authors comment on this?\n\n# Writing Notes\n* The term \"contextual vector\" or \"contextual dueling bandit\" is used many times to refer to the feature ${\\bf x}_i$ of arm $i$.
