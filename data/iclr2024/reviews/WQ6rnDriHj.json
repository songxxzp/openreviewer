As for one hot vectors and bisection points, how is the code table initialized?\n\nFrom the description, it seems that the only loss is Eq.9. Compare to VQ-VAE, do you fix the code book and cancel the code book learning loss as well as the commitment loss? What is $L_d$ in Eq.9?\n\n2. In the paragraph \u201clatent action confidence predictor\u201d, what does it mean by \u201cthe action model prefers to select the latent action with more recent training samples\u201d? Does recent samples here refers to more frequently seen samples? Can you further explain why it is similar to RND?\n\n3. Currently, evaluation seems to be limited in relatively simple / periodically locomotion tasks. As for the scalability of the method, can GADM solve relatively complicated tasks (e.g., manipulation, locomotion with obstacles)?\n\n4. For D4RL tasks, in quite interesting to see the locomotion tasks require such a small $K$ (e.g., K=4 for hopper). Can you further explain on this? It is interesting to see what will happen if you directly discretize the action or cluster the (s,a) pairs for such tasks. This can test what is the key of the method: the proposed action model or just reducing the action size."

                "value": "The primary problem with the paper is a non-rigorous treatment of writing, prior work, and experiments.\n\n## 1. Writing\n### 1A. Incomplete Placement of the paper in the context of Prior Work\n- Action representations are learned and utilized in prior work in different ways, which are not discussed or addressed:\n\t+ [1] separate RL into learning action representations and then performing RL over the action representations.\n\t+ [3, 4] learn a latent space of discrete actions during policy training by using forward or inverse models.\n\t+ [2, 5] propose RL frameworks that can learn with evolving or changing action spaces, and are compatible with action representations.\n\t+ [6] use demonstration data to extract action representations\n- Alternate ways of discretizing the action space should be compared against as baselines to the proposed VQ-VAE approach:\n\t+ [7-9] are various approaches to discretize the continuous action space \u2014 which makes these methods applicable to hybrid action spaces as well.\n### 1B. Unsubstantiated / hand-wavy claims\n- \"But we argue that these algorithms can naturally be seen as a special case of our framework.\" - How are prior works in action representation learning a special case for the proposed framework? The assumptions made are different and the kinds of representation spaces learned are different.\n- \"which show its potential as a general design of decision-making foundation models\" - How?\n\n### 1C. Missing Important Details\n- The baselines should be introduced in writing and talked about \u2014 how they are expected to be worse in comparison to the GADM.\n- Most of appendix experiments are not referenced in the main paper, so hard to find out what's relevant or not.\n\n\n## 2. Approach\n### 2A. Complicated design Choices skipped or not justified.\n- Many important components of the method are skipped in writing or not explained / justified properly, but then referred to in the experiments section:\n\t+ What does \"diversity-aware codetable\" mean?\n\t+ Why is the loss weighted by the reward function in Eq. 9? This is a myopic approach to loss weighting and would make long horizon credit assignment infeasible. Also, reward norm seems like a heuristic that won't necessarily work in all environments. For instance, in negative reward environments, norm(R(s,a)) would be higher for worse actions and the action model would ignore actions that give close to zero reward \u2014 which are actually better reward values.\n\t+ Latent Action Confdience Predictor: How is this implemented and what is its purpose? The writing is very unclear.\n\t+ What is E.A.R. \u2014 it is never introduced in the approach?\n\t+ Warmup was never mentioned in the approach section. Anything that is important to make the method work should be discussed in the approach \u2014 for reproducibility.\n\n## 3. Experiments\n### 3A. Baselines\n- For hybrid action space environments, a fairer baseline than HPPO is \"Parameterized Action DDPG\" because it is off-policy RL, whereas HPPO is on-policy.\n- No error bars in tables \u2014 important because the performance differences are miniscule.\n- GADM+DQN should be compared against standard algorithms like SAC or TD3 on continuous action space environments.\n- MuZero should be compared against on some discrete action task.\n- A crucial comparison should be against continuous action representation learning instead of the discretization introduced by the VQ-VAE. This is also done in prior work listed above, so it's important to show why discretization is the right way to go.\n\n### 3B. Environments\n- Experiments on standard discrete and continuous online RL environments are missing. Only hybrid action space experiments are provided, while the paper claims: \"learn unified and compact discrete latent actions for different environments that even correspond to continuous or hybrid action spaces.\"\n- Appendix: \"We evaluate on 4 environments\", but I only see 1 (hopper-v3). Were the results on other tasks not promising?\n- Why inconsistent environments between baseline results (only hybrid action space environments) and ablations (HalfCheetah)?\n\n### 3C. Missing Ablations\n- standard VQ-GVAE v/s diversity-aware codetable\n- FiLM v/s no FiLM.\n- Reward normalization v/s not\n\n### 3D. Analysis Experiments\n- Sensitivity to the codebook size?\n\n### [References]\n[1] Jain, Ayush, Andrew Szot, and Joseph Lim. \"Generalization to New Actions in Reinforcement Learning.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

Moreover, GADM seems to require a heavy amount of hyperparameter optimization, and it is not clear if when the baselines are provided with the same level of optimization, would they be generally better? If GADM is only meant to work with hybrid action space, that is fine, but then the paper should adjust its claims accordingly. A more thorough experimental evaluation is required to justify the proposed approach."

                "value": "- *Insufficient Method Details*: The paper doesn't sufficiently describe the method. It's not until Page 6 that the paper discusses GADM in detail. Furthermore, this discussion omits many key details about GADM and only presents them in the supplementary. For example, the main paper doesn't discuss the latent confidence prediction. It also doesn't clearly refer to the section in the supplementary that contains this content (instead referring to \"other design details are also listed in Appendix A.2\"). Other important details not mentioned in Sec. 3 include: using focal loss, the weight initialization of the confidence predictor, random collection warmup, and EAR. \n- *Insufficient Experimental Details*: Details about the online RL results in Sec 4.1.1 are not sufficiently described. No details about MPDQN and HPPO are described anywhere in the paper. It's therefore unclear if the experiment shows a fair comparison between GADM+DQN, MPDQN and HPPO. Furthermore, the main paper never mentions the 4 environments used in Fig. 5. While the supplementary contains these details, they are crucial to describe in the main paper. Especially the details concerning the environment action space since that is what the method is learning a representation of. Details about the offline RL results are likewise lacking in details.\n- *No Comparison to Action Representation Learning Methods*: As the authors stated in Sec. 5, there exists prior work that learns discrete representations of actions. For example, the paper states, \"Dadashi et al. (2022) and Gu et al. (2022) propose to learn a set of plausible discrete actions from expert demonstrations to overcome the curse of dimensionality problem\". Yet, as far as I can tell, GADM isn't compared to any other action representation learning methods. Instead, GADM is only compared to methods that operate directly in the raw action space. Without this comparison, I cannot assess the empirical benefit of the method over prior works.\n- *Connection to Prior Work*: The connection to prior work is unclear. When referring to related work in learning action spaces, the paper states, \"we argue that these algorithms can naturally be seen as a special case of our framework,\" but the paper doesn't explain why this is the case. The novelty of GADM and why prior works aren't applicable in the considered settings are unclear. \n- *GADM Complexity*: I don't see how GADM enables \"researchers to concentrate on only one of the topics\" of action representation learning and RL since there are many details of GADM that are coupled with the RL process itself. GADM requires a pre-collected dataset to train the action model, strategies to mask the action space, action remapping, and handling extreme actions. All these added options affect the RL training. Furthermore, at the end of Sec. 1, the paper states the experiments demonstrate the \"scalability\" of the method, yet these added components seem to limit scalability. \n- GADM is described as an action representation model, yet ultimately, the encoder is learning a representation of action _and state_. GADM doesn't compare to the effect of learning the action representation conditioned on the state versus not using the state information. \n- $K$ is an important hyperparameter in GADM. How robust is GADM to the choice of $K$? Table 3 shows GADM performing better with a $K$ value of 4 vs. 8. How does performance vary across more values of $K$? \n\nGenerally, the presentation of the method and experiments makes it hard to assess the work properly. I recommend the authors compress Sec 3.1 and move key details from the supplementary about the method and experiments into the main paper."

                "value": "- What is the novelty of GADM with respect to prior work? What are the limitations of prior work that prevent them from learning latent actions that can be applied to a variety of RL settings and environments? \n- Why not compare to Sampled MuZero in experimental settings from the original Sampled MuZero paper? Instead, the authors compare it in a new setting in D4RL, making it hard to verify the performance of Sampled MuZero. \n- Why does the latent action dimension greatly vary between environments? For Hopper in the offline RL environments, it is 4, yet for online RL experiments, it is 256. Why do some environments require 64x more embedding table dimensions?"
