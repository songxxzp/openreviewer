Is there any evidence to show that the performance already saturate on one backbone, but decrease on the other backbones? It could be the case that the distillation process is even \"underfit\" on a given architecture - and the performance drop during \"transferring\" (i.e., distill with one backbone and then evaluate on the others) could be just some normal \"generalization error\". I would suggest to use the terminology more carefully to avoid such an confusion, or provide evidence to support the terminology. \n\n2. From what I am understanding, this work actually alters the evaluation process (the process of training a model on the distilled image set). Augmenting the training process is not novel at the high level as many previous works have already done so. A lot of augmentation to architectures (like DropOut and DropPath etc. ) and data (MixUp, CutMix, AutoAugment, etc. ) could be applied here and I think that can serve as potential baselines. \n\n3. Table 2 provides lower results for MTT baselines. From the original paper, MTT reaches 65.3/71.6 accuracy on CIFAR-10, while in Table 2 the authors reported 63.6 and 70.2. I am curious why there is a performance gap since it may create invalid performance advantages for the proposed techniques. \n \n\n4. Section 4.2 is interesting, but I think it is off-topic. The paper is trying to solve the so-called \"architectural overfitting\" but it will not happen when there is no actual \"fitting\" process. Therefore, I think Contribution 3 is do not count and the contribution bullets should be adjusted."

In dataset distillation, we should definitely focus on the former and should not make any assumptions on how users should use provided synthetic datasets for **downstream** training. What I want to see is actually a thorough algorithm for the process of dataset distillation that can improve the cross-architecture performance following the original evaluation protocols. The current form does not really enhance dataset distillation. The improvement is from the strategies of using distilled datasets.\n2. If the paper focuses on how to use distilled datasets, the problem can be cast to some more classical problems, like how to avoid overfitting, synthetic-to-real generalization, few-shot learning, etc. The authors fail to make a broader discussion.\n3. The technical novelty is limited because the authors only provide strategies with minor designs that can empirically improve the performance. Without sufficient analysis, the principles of how the proposed methods work are unclear, which results in limited scientific value.\n4. The proposed methods are somewhat complicated. For example, they assume users would apply a three-phase keep rate during training with DropPath, which introduces lots of hyper-parameters and makes the pipeline complex and less robust."

In dataset distillation, one derives a small synthetic dataset from a given larger, real dataset (along with a \u201ctraining\u201d network) that captures the learnable properties of the real dataset and can be used to train other \u201ctest\u201d networks more efficiently to hopefully achieve similar performance as achievable with the real dataset. An issue that has been noticed in prior work is that when the training and testing networks differ more in architecture, the distilled synthetic dataset starts being less useful, in terms of the task performance.\n\nThe submission suggests two main modifications to training the test networks. (1) Since the training networks used for distillation tend to be somewhat shallow, while the downstream test networks are intended to be larger, one heuristic is to train the test networks with a form of regularization that simulates shallower networks. In particular, dropping layers randomly can simulate a form of shallowness (with linear transforms to account for dimension matching). (2) Since it is known that performance drops upon moving to a larger network, one can further attempt to improve training of the test networks by using knowledge distillation to match the predictive distributions of the test network to the smaller training network acting as teacher.\n\nThese two tricks seem useful, illustrating significant improvements on existing benchmarks, for a choice of existing dataset distillation methods."

Modifying the training procedure of the test networks with sensible regularizations that enable this transfer can be quite significant in practice."
