This approach facilitates interaction between samples and features and employs a batch-attention mechanism for feature selection by assigning weights to each dimension of the augmented feature. More specifically, each feature dimension is represented as a unique node, and each sample is also depicted as a unique node with the raw feature of that sample serving as the node feature. Each edge signifies that a sample possesses the edge attribute value at that particular feature dimension. The goal of the self-supervised method is to predict edge attribute, which finally generated augmented features. Experimental results demonstrate that this novel method surpasses traditional benchmarks in most tasks and datasets."
