In a non-ood paper, Large-Scale Long-Tailed Recognition in an Open World, the authors used center loss to make known classes more compact and use feature distance to for ood. And it was almost 5 years ago. Simply changing center loss to multiple binary triplet loss is not sufficient.\n2) More importantly, none of the newer ood methods, for example One-Ring: A Simple Method for Source-free Open-partial Domain Adaptation, are fully discussed or compared in the experiments. Therefore, the robustness of the proposed method is not justified, In addition, One-Ring, even though uses additional classification dimension, also follows the intuition of utilizing non-occupied space for ood."

OE achieves remarkable performance by solely requiring a single network to concurrently manage classification and the rejection of unknowns. It's worth noting that this paper doesn't make any references to OE, and there is a noticeable lack of in-depth discussion or comparison concerning methods and experimental results. Essentially, the primary contributions introduced in this paper have already been covered in OE.\n\n(2)\tThe choice of known unknowns is unfair. \nIn the original paper of OE, for fair comparison, the authors ensured that the known unknowns (i.e., outliers) collected and the unknowns in the testing phase had no overlapping classes. They carefully removed those unknowns with the same categories. However, in the setup in Section 5.1 of this paper, the authors employed half of the unknown classes for all datasets, making the comparison unfair to implement.\n\n(3)\tLack of an important baseline recently proposed.\nThe author has mentioned that the recent work [Vaze et al., 2022] finds that simply training a network on the closed set can achieve the SOTA performance. However, the author does not provide a detailed comparison with this baseline in the paper. Moreover, despite the use of a slightly different network architecture, the results of (ARPL+CS) in this paper are significantly lower than those in [Vaze et al., 2022], which compromises the reliability of the experimental outcomes. To enhance the credibility of the findings, the author should furnish more detailed results.\n\nReferences:\n[Hendrycks et al., 2019] Deep Anomaly Detection with Outlier Exposure.

Authors proposed SCAD method tackles this by learning two specialized functions: one to distinguish between known and unknown classes and another for classifying known classes. SCAD trains with \"known unknowns\" to enhance the distinction between classes in the embedding space and uses prototypes to set discrimination thresholds. This specialized dual-function approach allows SCAD to outperform existing methods in OSR, as evidenced by higher AUROC scores and correct classification rates."
