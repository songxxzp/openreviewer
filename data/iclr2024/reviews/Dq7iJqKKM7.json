The authors argued that existing approaches ignore the inter-dependence among node points for loss computation, which is incorrect. There are in fact quite a few existing works that already considered designing inter-dependent loss for graph learning tasks. \n\nFor example, [1] proposes a new objective based on conditional random field for node classification, and [2] harnesses label propagation as a re-weighted loss. Besides, there are also recent works proposing self-supervised loss that considers enforcing the consistency between connected nodes [3]. These approaches integrate the inter-dependence of nodes into the loss function for training.\n\nAnother weakness lies in the comparison in experiments. The current experiment only compares with the traditional cross-entropy loss, which is a very weak baseline. More comparison with other advanced methods, particularly the above-mentioned models are needed to well justify the efficacy of the new design.\n\n[1] Meng Qu, et al., Neural Structured Prediction for Inductive Node Classification, ICLR 2022\n\n[2] Hande Dong, et al., On the Equivalence of Decoupled Graph Convolution Network and Label Propagation, WWW 2021\n\n[3] Hengrui Zhang, et al., Localized Contrastive Learning on Graphs"
