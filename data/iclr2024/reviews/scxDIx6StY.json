                "value": "W1: The presentation of the paper requires to be improved heavily. Some examples are as follows:\n\n(i) In the listed contributions, the statements of \"Novelty\", \"Generalization\", and \"Effectiveness and Robustness\" are improper. The authors should state the specific contributions of this work here, e.g., \"Novelty\"->\"A novel adaptive temperature enhanced\nhypergraph contrastive learning framework\".\n\n(ii) In Preliminaries, the statement \"The main idea of graph contrastive learning aims to maximize the agreements among positive and negative contrastive pairs over\" is not clear. Using a more clear statement \"The main idea of graph contrastive learning aims to maximize the similarity between positive pairs and meanwhile minimize the similarity between negative pairs\" is better. Also, in Equation (2), sim($\\cdot$) is not given a definition or explanation.\n\n(iii) In Methodology, the graph augmentation process itself adds noise to the original graph, so the module with the name \"noise-enhanced hypergraph augmentation\" is strange. It may be better if the authors replace \"noise-enhanced\" with \"feature distortion based\".  The symbols of $x_{i}$ and $\\delta_{i}$ should be bolded as they represent vectors, not values. The definition of the concatenation operator is ambiguous: sometimes they are denoted as $[\\cdot:\\cdot]$ and sometimes they are denoted as $\\oplus$. In Equation (5), $\\eta$ has unclear statements and it represents the learning rate of the temperature adjustment.\n\n(iv) Many contents in the main body are not self-contained, e.g., Table 3 should be moved into the main body.\n\n\nW2: Lacking necessary analysis of the important loss function. The authors do not analyze the JSD loss in the paper, but why they can conclude that  AdT-HyGCL is suitable for JSD loss (note that JSD loss is totally different from NT-Xent loss)?\n\nW3: The presented experimental results have lots of errors. Some examples are as follows:\n\n(i) In Table 1, for Macro-F1 results, the best result should be \"64.98 \u00b1 1.77\" and the runner-up should be \"64.65 \u00b1 0.85\" on Citeseer.\n\n(ii) In Table 2, the best result should be \"59.65 \u00b1 1.62\" on House (Nettack).\n\nThese errors make the whole experimental analysis not convincing.\n\nW4: Lacking some important baseline comparison. The paper does not compare AdT-HyGCL with other temperature adjustment methods (e.g., the methods in [1], [2], and [3]), which limits the ability to assess the effectiveness of AdT-HyGCL relative to other methods.\n\n[1] Chen, Jiawei, et al. \"Adap-$\\tau$: Adaptively Modulating Embedding Magnitude for Recommendation.\" WWW2023.\n\n[2] Qiu, Zi-Hao, et al. \"Not All Semantics are Created Equal: Contrastive Self-supervised Learning with AutomaticTemperature Individualization.\" ICML2023.\n\n[3] Zhang, Oliver, et al. \"Temperature as uncertainty in contrastive learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.04403(2021)."

                "value": "1. The motivation of this work is not good enough.\nFor example, the authors claim that \"they (graphs) have limitations in captureing ... higher-order group-wise structures.'' What is the meaning of high-order group-wise structures in this paper? Why is the statement correct? Considering the higher-order structures (such as communities) are widely studied in the field of graph data analysis, it is better to showcase the viewpoints carefully.\nFurthermore, the authors claim that \"current contrastive learning methods over hypergraphs still have limitations in modeling the high-order relationships ... within hypergraphs ...\". Then, maybe hyper-hypergraphs, if any, cannot capture the high-order relationshi within hyper-hypergraphs. Is it really interesting? Should we propose another \"dual-level contrast mechanism\" for the hyper-hypergraphs?\n   \n    \n2. The novelty of this study is not clear. \n\n(1) The novelty of the concept of `noise-enhanced' should be clearly presented. The stategy of performing noises to node attribute features has been well utilized in the literature, such as [1]. The authors should carefully discussed them in the manuscript, especially when [1] has been cited as [Zhu, et al. 2021b] in the paper. \n\n(2) The idea of using community structures in constrastive learning has been proposed in the literature, such as [2]. The authors should clearly present this point. In addition, it seems that the ``community'' in this study does not match the well-known community in the literature. Then, it is better to use another phrase in this work to aoivd the ambiguiity. \n\n(3) The idea of the adaptive temperature-enhanced contrast optimization in pre-tained models (including GNNs) has been proposed in the literature, such as [3-6]. The authors should clearly discuss the differences between this work and the literature.\n\n3. The methods of the paper should be carefully presented.\nConsidering the adaptive temperature-enhanced contrast optimization in pre-tained models (including GNNs) has been proposed in the literature, such as [3-6], the authors should clearly present the relationship between the propostions as well as their proofs and the literature. In addition, the proofs of these propositions should be carefully presented rather than giving one or more examples. For instance, it is stated that ``the temperature descents'' in the paper. Why must the temperature descent during the training process for any loss? The authors should prove it seriously. \n\n4. The experiments of the paper should be improved.\nAs shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the experimental results of the proposed AdT-HyGCL are not always the best. Maybe the authors should analyze and present the reasons. Also, the parameter sensitivity experiments should be provided, such as $\\tau_{low}$, $\\eta$, $\\rho$, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$. In addition, more recent studies on hypergraph contrastive\nlearning shoud be considered as baselines, such as [7][8].\n\n[1] Graph Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Augmentation. Y. Zhu, Y. Xu, F.

                "value": "This paper introduces a dual-level hypergraph contrastive learning framework, AdT-HyGCL. It incorporates a dual-level contrast mechanism (the node level and community level) and an adaptive temperature-enhanced approach to improve the effectiveness of contrastive learning over hypergraphs. The research addresses certain limitations observed in existing works focusing on modeling high-order relationships over unlabeled data. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed AdT-HyGCL."

                "value": "The novelty of this paper lies in its endeavor to overcome the constraints encountered in prior research pertaining to the modeling of high-order relationships within unlabeled data. It shifts its emphasis towards the intricate realm of group-wise collective behaviors within hypergraphs. Additionally, it introduces an innovative adaptive temperature coefficient designed to autonomously fine-tune the representation distances. As for clarity, I think this paper is written in a lucid and comprehensible manner, ensuring ease of understanding for its readers. Theoretical justifications meet the requirements, and empirical experiments are abundant.  The authors demonstrated through a substantial number of experiments that the method exhibits advantages in terms of generality, effectiveness, and robustness. This method has achieved SOTA performance in hypergraph contrastive learning, which I believe holds implications."

Additionally, it may be beneficial to provide an exposition on how these two branches are integrated to obtain the final representations."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. I have some difficulty in comprehending how the adaptive temperature parameter is implemented. Could you provide more formulaic evidence or details of its code implementation?\n2. Why were UniGCNII and AllDeepSets chosen for the robustness experiments instead of a seemingly more effective method like CHGNN? Can you provide the robustness experiment results for CHGNN?\n3. I am curious about how the final representations obtained from the \"node-level\" and \"community-level\" branches in the paper are combined. On a theoretical level, how is the balance between the results obtained from these two branches achieved?"
