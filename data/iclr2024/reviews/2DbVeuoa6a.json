Mathematically speaking, the two loss functions are identitcal and so should be the gradients. The only difference I can spot is potentially an added spectral transform in the gradients due to the summation in spectral space. Numerically, this would make a difference but I have a hard time understanding why this should lead to better performance. Any ideas?\n2. Results specify resolutions for FNO but do not disclose the spectral resolution/param count for the NSM. I encourage the authors to add this information\n3. Figure 2b - why is there only a single point for all resolutions of NSM?\n\nMinor/Clarity:\n1. in eq. 5 what is phi? It doesn't seem to be defined\n2. The statement that the neural operator is a mapping between grid points is limiting. It is simply realised as such and trained at a fixed resolution but conceptually, nothing stops the user from evaluating it on another grid. I believe this is what the authors mean with \"implemented\" in the last sentence of page 4 but I find this sentence to be somewhat misleading. A clarification would help in my opinion."

Also how does the spectral approach compare to Implicit Neural Spatial Representations for Time-dependent PDEs (ICML 2023) which avoids grid completely and only user a MLP architecture.\n\n\"Focus on scenarios with no solution data.\" This is understandable but the scope of the paper. Since the author's method is a very general spectral formulation, why not try it on some data? My biggest concern right now is that the examples shown are all 2D toy example. Would it make sense to try the method on large scale 3D problems where data is already available?\n\n\"Dresdner et al. (2022); Xia et al. (2023); Meuris et al.

The authors propose in this paper two novelties for PDE-based neural networks : a spectral loss and a general design for spectral-based neural operators. While I understand that the first is supposed to simplify the training of PINNs, the second one seems to be a new architecture for solving operator learning tasks like FNO or SNO. Therefore, their method is not a PINN-like solver with a new loss, but rather a deep surrogate model that can approximate the PDE solution from an initial condition or forcing term, without data in the domain. This positioning should be stated explicitly. \n\nAs a consequence, the selected baselines and chosen setting cannot lead to a fair comparison between the different methods. Neural operators such as FNO or SNO have been proposed to learn mappings between functions that can be accessed through point-wise evaluations. Therefore, they require data for training and should not be trained with a PDE loss only. I think the authors should focus their comparison with classical PINN methods, and show first that their model is capable of solving a single equation for diverse types of PDEs, and then compare it to PINN approaches that target generalization through meta-learning such as [1], [2].\n\nI also do not understand why NSM is claimed to be insensitive to the grid size. Is a grid ever used for NSM ?  The forcing terms or initial conditions seem to be queried at the collocation points. This avoids aliasing problems rather than preventing them.\n\nThere is overall a lack of details regarding the implementation of the proposed method.
