Qualitative and quantitative results conducted using shape reconstruction, transfer, disentanglement and evolution experiments and demonstrate competitive performance.\n\nEDIT: I have updated my rating after reading authors' comments."

Authors should provide more clear motivation of why the proposed method will be useful for medical imaging. \n\nAs described in Section 3.1, it is assumed that \u201cthe overall displacement field is the sum of displacement fields that are controlled by individual parameters\u201d, plus there is a contribution of the unknown covariate (z) which cannot be controlled. However, it isn\u2019t clear what happens if a key covariate is unknown (e.g., not provided in metadata) or a not useful covariate is present? The authors should clearly explain implications of such assumptions. \n\nThere are several weaknesses in related work:\n \n* Relationship to other methods (Mu 2021) is not clearly described. What is the methodological advantage that the proposed technique brings?\n* Related work is limited to representations focusing on implicit functions. There is other work in allowing parametrized shape editing, e.g., see for instance: Learning to Infer Semantic Parameters for 3D Shape Editing (Wei, 3DV 2020)"
