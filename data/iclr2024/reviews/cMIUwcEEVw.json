The authors first show a surprising experimental result: the existing offline MBRL method MOPO does not work when replacing learned models with true dynamics models. They claim that the reason for this failure is the overestimation of values on the edge-of-reach states which are only reached at the final time steps of the limited horizon rollouts. To address this issue, they propose a new method RAVL which combines EDAC and MOPO. They validate the performance of RAVL on a simple 2D environment and D4RL benchmarks."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The authors first reveal the key overestimation issue of values on edge-of-reach states in offline MBRL. However, as a direct combination of EDAC and MOPO, the proposed method RAVL is largely independent of the revealed issue. In particular, the only difference between RAVL and MOPO is that RAVL exhibits the Q-update rule in EDAC. However, such a Q-update rule is performed on all states in the buffer and is not tailored for edge-of-reach states. RAVL does not identify edge-of-reach states and correct the corresponding values to address the claimed issue.\n2. There is a large gap between the formalization in Section 4.3 and actual offline MBRL methods. First, the definition of edge-of-reach states is very limited. Concretely, such a definition only considers the case where the starting states of model rollouts are only sampled from the initial state distribution. However, in offline MBRL,  the starting state could be any state along the trajectories in the offline dataset. Such a gap leads to a problem that the Edge-of-reach states defined in Definition 1 could be **not** edge-of-reach in model rollouts with different starting states. For instance, let $(s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, s_2, a_2)$ be a trajectory in the offline dataset. We consider two types of model rollouts with different starting states: $(s_0, \\hat{a}_0, \\hat{s}_1, \\hat{a}_1, \\hat{s}_2, \\hat{a}_2)$ and $(s_1, \\tilde{a}_1, \\tilde{s}_2, \\tilde{a}_2,  \\tilde{s}_3, \\tilde{a}_3)$. Here $\\hat{s}_2$ is edge-of-reach for the first type of model rollouts but could be not edge-of-reach for the second type of model rollouts.\nSecond, Proposition 1 considers an extremely simple case where the Q-update is performed only on a single model rollout. However, in MBRL, Q-updates are performed on multiple model rollouts where states could be overlapped. In this case, the analysis of Q-functions could be much more complicated.\n    \n3. The empirical performance of RAVL is not strong. In D4RL, the existing method MOBILE beats RAVL regarding the number of best-performance tasks, implying that the improvement of RAVL is limited."

Based on this understanding, the authors propose Reach-Aware Value Learning (RAVL), which eschews explicit dynamics uncertainty quantification in favor of pessimism with respect to a critic ensemble, as in Ensemble-Diversified Actor Critic (EDAC), a model-free offline RL algorithm. RAVL is evaluated on a subset of the D4RL benchmark, where it exhibits performance competitive with the SOTA."
