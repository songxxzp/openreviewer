                "value": "1. The paper studies the inconsistency problem between causal structure and representation. However, what is structure and representation is never formally defined in the paper. I understand from Definition 1, structure refers to the graph and representation is simply the output of a deep network operating on the data, like word embeddings of text. However, the authors consider two causal models one with the representation and one with the structure, which is confusing. A concrete example with the same data, but the two different U and V causal models for the structure and the representation would go a long way in making the presentation more clear.\n\n2. Hypothesis 2 is not clear. What does the notation E(\\hat{x}_{s,m,n}) = x_{s,m,n} mean? The E operator has not been defined, is it the expectation? If so, what is the expectation over?\n\n3. Section 2.2 is incomprehensible. What is causal consistency has not been defined so far, What is been plotted in Figure 1. The caption says it is the MSE between similarity matrices of representation and structure. What are these similarity matrices? Appendix A.3 does not give these details. What is the reconstruction loss the authors are referring to here? For example, lines 130-133, the authors say in the M > 1 or D > 1 case, the optimization of causal strength f changes to a weighted linear combination of f_m for the different M structures. However, this optimization problem has never been defined. Numerous such issues plague the readability of the paper.\n\n4. Eq 3 is unclear. What is L_k, what is being optimized? I understand at a high level we have 2 causal models, we intervene on both of them, and then have a way of checking the consistency of the two models. But beyond this high-level details, exact specifics of how the authors carry out the interventions and check for consistency is not present in the paper. \n\n5. The authors propose a Causalogue dataset for causal discovery. However, it is not clear how this dataset was construcuted. The appendix gives some details. However, the authors handcraft 10 causal structures. It is not clear how GPT-4 was prompted to respect this causal structure while generating the utterances. \n\nI think the entire paper needs significant restructuring to make the presentation clear and allow readers to understand the main contributions and needs more details to reproduce the results."
