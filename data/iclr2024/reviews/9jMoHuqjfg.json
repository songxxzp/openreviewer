From this perspective, merlin has only limited novelty. Start with the cleanest method, merlin build policy upon $s, g, h$ instead of $s, g$ by GCSL. Although the merlin shows better results in the motivation example, I think it's because of the inclusion of a more stable time guide.\n2.I observe that Merlin-NP and Merlin-P show better results in the experiments, but they can be considered as GCSL + temporal constraints + reverse dynamics model (Wang et al.) + trajectory stitching (a commonly used data augmentation method in OfflineRL). These other components can be easily combined with the universal GCRL approach, so the performance gains are no surprise. \n3.The approach seems sensitive to hyperparameters like time horizon and hindsight ratio. I'm not sure that good performance comes from hyperparameter tuning."

Success rate should be a common metric for evaluating a GCRL algorithm.\n\nOverall this paper proposes interesting ideas for offline goal-conditioned RL as diffusion process. The empirical results are strong but there are some open questions (see above weakness and questions). Addressing some of the weaknesses and questions raised would strengthen the paper further. I think the central problem is that the article overclaimed the design of the approach to solving the GCRL problem by a diffusion process and I vote reject for current version."

First, it is explained that the trajectory is denoised, which would result in a denoising of states. However, in the following sections, suddenly the action is denoised (see section 4.1)\n- Is the policy a diffusion model? It is mentioned that BC is performed at the end of section 5.2.\n- The paper would definitely benefit from an algorithm description of the method\n- It appears that the dataset extension through trajectory stitching is not performed for the baseline methods, which makes the comparison unfair\n- The fact that methods based on inverse dynamics model approaches did not work weakens the method, as trajectoriy stitching has obv. downsides and likely only works in state spaces that resemble physical environments\n\n\nRelated work:\n\n[1] \"Goal-Conditioned Imitation Learning using Score-based Diffusion Policies\", Reuss et al. 2023"
