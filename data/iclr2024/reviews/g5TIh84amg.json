To do this, the authors propose to rewrite each loss on a common form that has the same gradients as the original loss. This common form is of a gradient weight $w$ times a margin difference $\\Delta$ (they also consider a more general form taking regularization into account). The authors then study these two quantities for different loss functions during training for clean and noisy labelled examples separately. For example, i) they find that gradient weights are higher for clean samples for the losses that generalize the best, ii) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) first learns easy examples which causes lower $\\Delta$ of noisy examples (\u201csample sifting\u201d), iii) label smoothing increases convergence and separations in $\\Delta$. Finally, the authors study the underfitting issues of MAE via $w$ and $\\Delta$ and proposes an effective fix.\n\nTherefore, the contributions of the paper are to rewrite the losses on a common form, their observations, as well as the modification of MAE."

Having said that, I believe the significance of this work could be improved considerably by making the explanations, findings, and conclusions **clearer**:\n* What is the motivation for rewriting the losses in this particular way? What novel perspective does this form give over something more intuitive like the $p_y$ and the gradient magnitude of the loss wrt to the logits? For example, in Figure 1, couldn\u2019t one see the same thing with an x-axis with $p_y$ instead of $\\Delta$, and the y-axis being the gradient magnitude wrt the logits for the MAE green curve instead of $w$?\n* How isn\u2019t it trivial that different loss functions have different gradient weights, and therefore different sample weights? If all loss functions penalized the same, there would be no reason to have different ones?\n* A single sentence motivating the inequality in Equation 5 would make it clearer.\n* The clarity of several equations could be improved:\n  * The equation between Equations 2 and 3 is crucial and could be made much clearer: i) a single sentence discussion or motivation for using stop gradient, ii) what $\\Delta_y$ is, iii) why two additional minus signs are added in the middle equation, iv) and as $w$ is a key component of the paper, I believe it deserves a proper definition.\n  * The equation at the end of page 3: i) why are stop gradients used in that derivation? ii) why is a factor of k and 1/k introduced?\n* It was unclear to me, why the more general form that accounts for regularization was introduced, when its properties like $R(s)$ never were studied.\n\n**Experimental Rigor.**\n\nReporting mean and standard deviation would improve the conclusiveness of the observations in the tables. Furthermore, the network predictions from several runs could be used to have more reliable histogram estimates (more data).\n\n**Novelty and Significance.**\n* What novelty and significance does this work add over that of Wang et al. [1]?\n  * What are the benefits of viewing the losses in terms of the gradient of $\\Delta$ rather than the more natural gradient magnitude wrt to the logits?\n  * The following finding is not novel: \u201cZhang & Sabuncu (2018) attribute underfitting of MAE to the lack of the 1/py term in sample gradients, which \u201ctreats every sample equally\u201d and thus hampers learning. In contrast, we show that MAE emphasizes samples with moderate \u2206(s, y).\u201d That MAE does not treat samples equally and instead focus on examples with moderate loss/$\\Delta$, is not novel in this work. This is one of the main findings of Wang et al., which is clearly shown in their Figure 1 (or 2 depending on version of the paper), where examples with low and high $p_y$ have small gradients.\n  * I believe the following quote is misrepresenting the related work: \u201c.. attribute underfitting to their low variance, making clean and noise samples less distinguishable. But as shown in Table 4 MAE can underfit data with clean labels.\u201d. Wang et al. did not mention that the variance was low between clean and noisy samples, but rather the more general \u201cinformative\u201d and \u201cuninformative\u201d examples. Furthermore, the finding that MAE underfits clean examples is not novel, and even Wang et al. clearly shows this in their Table 1.\n  * Finally, Wang et al. already proposed a fix for MAE. Therefore, the novelty and significance of the proposed fix in this paper is unclear. A proper comparison (theoretically and experimentally) with other fixes for MAE is required.\n* What\u2019s the significance of the proposed way of rewriting the loss functions? If one instead does similar studies in terms of loss values (e.g., Figure 3 in [1], and Figure 2 in [2]) or gradients (e.g., Theorem 1 in [3]), it seems many of the findings in the paper are already well-known. For example, that the gradients of clean examples dominates the early learning phase and then the gradients for noisy labelled examples take over, resulting in overfitting [3]. Another example, that regularization methods If there are any novel and significant findings, I believe the authors should much more clearly state, relate, and discuss the significance of them compared to related work. That MAE focuses on moderate loss examples, as shown by Wang et al. (2019a).\n\n\n**Missing related work.**\n\nThe list of robust loss functions is comprehensive, but missing some relevant ones based on information theory: i) f-divergences [5], ii) Bregman divergences [6], and iii) Jensen-Shannon divergences [7].\n\n**References.**\n\n[1] Wang X, Hua Y, Kodirov E, Robertson NM.
