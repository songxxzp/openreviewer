For example, \u201cCLIP\u2019s training regimen\u201d, \u201cin Figure 2 whether only learnable vectors are used for obtaining the label?\u201d. Also, it is not clear why use the \u201cembedding.weight\u201d to label the prompts.\n\n[$\\textbf{Missing Related Works}$] Some adapter-style tuning works are not discussed, e.g., \u201cPrompt, Generate, then Cache: Cascade of Foundation Models makes Strong Few-shot Learners, CVPR2023\u201d and \u201cTask Residual for Tuning Vision-Language Models, CVPR2023\u201d.\n\n[$\\textbf{Missing Comparisons with SOTA Methods}$] \u201cMaPLe: Multi-modal Prompt Learning, CVPR2023\u201d and \u201cSelf-regulating Prompts: Foundational Model Adaptation without Forgetting, ICCV2023\u201d are SOTA methods that adopt prompt learning. It would be nice to compare the generated prompts with these methods and the performance of these methods by adding the proposed loss in this method.\n\n[$\\textbf{Non-convincing Prompts}$] The visualization in Table 3 does not show the advantage of the proposed method. We can see this in three perspectives: (i) the generated prompts by PLPP are not always related to the dataset, e.g., \u201cverified\u201d for ImageNet, \u201cchance\u201d for Food101 and \u201ccrayon\u201d for OxfordPets; (ii) CoOp sometimes generates more accurate prompts, e.g., \u201cfruit\u201d for ImageNet, \u201cenjoyed\u201d for Food101 and \u201cpaw\u201d for OxfordPets; (iii) it seems the method does not work sometimes as prompts are same for # 15 on  Food101.\n\n[$\\textbf{Some Typos}$] There are some typos to be fixed, e.g., \u201cA OVERVIEW\u201d, \u201cused to aseess\u201d and \u201cleanable vectors\u201d. Please do careful proofreading before submission.\n\n[$\\textbf{Disordered Reference Formats}$] The format of reference should be organized. For example, the authors can choose one of \u201cEuropean Conference on Computer Vision\u201d and \u201cECCV\u201d to make it neat."

On some datasets, it even performs worse than CoOp, such as Flowers102, FGVCAircraft, EuroSAT. What could be the reasons for this? Although the focus of this paper is not on performance, both its performance and the focus on comprehensibility have not shown significant improvements. The experimental evaluations do not seem to validate the claimed contributions.\n- The perplexity metric is used to improve the comprehensibility. However, the perplexity metric cannot explicitly guide the prompts to be comprehensible.\n- This paper claims that \u201creadable prompts help in understanding the prediction results and applying the VL models in safety-critical scenarios.\u201d. However, the readability does not necessarily imply safety. The human-comprehensible prompt may not be the best choice for VLMs.\n- As \u201cPLPP can be integrated in any CoOp-based method\u201d, does it also validate useful for SOTA, rather than for the baselines CoOp and CoCoOp?"

According to the implementation details provided in Section 3.3, the authors obtain the word probability distribution of the input prompts by feeding the outputs of the CLIP text encoder to the transpose of the word embedding layer. The output of the CLIP text encoder is designed to compute the similarity between texts and images, instead of modeling the word distribution as LMs like BERT and GPT.  I think there is no guarantee that the output models the word probability distribution. Therefore, it is not meaningful to optimize the PPL of the distribution, which means the core design of the proposed method is problematic. How about using a pre-trained language model to calculate the PPL loss? \n\n- The experimental results are weak. The improvements reported in Table 1 are quite marginal and are likely within the random errors. According to results reported in MaPLe, the average performance of CoOp and CoCoOp are 71.66 and 75.83 respectively, which is higher than both the baseline results reported in this paper (71.07 and 75.23) and the proposed method (71.44 and 75.66). It is possible that the proposed method is not effective at all. \n\n- The motivation of the method is not well-supported by the results.

I think a weak score is not the main reason to reject a paper, provided it provides new insight for readers. While the inducing of the perplexity score is interesting. The authors did not deeply study this metric. First of all, you can give an analysis of how many handwriting prompts we need in order to train a perplexity model. You can also plot or simply list the change of prompts as you optimize the perplexity score, to let us see how your method drives the prompts to be more and more feasible to read. Besides, no ablation about lambda is introduced in your experiment setting, we do not even know the role of CE and PPL in your learning, which will be dominating in improving the perplexity? How is the influence? Is larger lambda better? What is the trade-off when we improve the perplexity? Why did you cross Entropy, why not L2 loss?
