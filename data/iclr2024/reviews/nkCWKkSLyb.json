Existing metrics and evaluation protocols are insufficient, despite the current high popularity of the topic. Therefore, authors are addressing an important and timely research topic.

The detailed evaluation and analysis of 8 popular editing methods is particularly interesting, highlighting their strengths and limitations.\n\nThe idea of going beyond global image scores and leveraging object detection tasks is interesting and has potential to provide informative insights."

                "value": "One big limitation of the paper is its poor presentation. It is very crowded, with a lot of vspace adjustments, making the reading experience uncomfortable. Several facts are repeated numerous times, notably editval\u2019s description and main contributions, while key elements are left for the reader to find in the appendix (e.g. the choice of the COCO dataset as source of images).  The definition of editVal instead is not clear, in certain parts of the paper it is described as the data, edits and automated eval, and in others (e.g. the introduction) it includes the human study as well. \n\nThe paper is presenting many contributions : building a benchmark, analyzing pre-existing methods through a human study, developing an automated evaluation metric and comparing this metric\u2019s performance to user preferences. It is impossible to address all thoroughly and clearly, leading to a lack of in depth discussion and exploration.  For example, the user study can provide a lot of insights over the different editing methods\u2019 behaviours, but only the top 4 methods (selected according to an unknown criterion) are briefly discussed in 4.2. Comparing the performance of methods that require fine-tuning vs training free, or methods that use similar editing mechanisms, for example, could be very interesting. Perhaps the work could be more impactful if split in multiple papers or sent to a venue where more space is available. \nAuthors also overclaim their contributions, presenting their automated pipeline as an alternative to the human study. However, their detection based strategy can only evaluate a subset of editing tasks, and only provides a binary success/fail output. In addition, additional editing criteria (content preservation, image quality) cannot be measured this way, with authors reverting to standard metrics (FID, DINO scores) to complete their evaluation process.  It is not clear whether these two additional metrics are part of the automated evaluation pipeline. \n\nThe related work section is too limited. An important topic of the paper is the lack of reliable evaluation metrics for editing tasks, yet pre-existing works are not reviewed (besides CLIP). For examples, authors do not discuss recent techniques such as ImageReward (Xu et al, Neurips 2023) or Pickscore (Kirstain et al. , 2023). Furthermore, the detection based metric should be compared to these other metrics  in terms of human preference correlation, to highlight the advantages of the proposed technique.  \nIt should also be noted that authors claim a strong correlation between their human study and their proposed metric, yet DINO scores show a much stronger correlation (fig 10), than the owl-vit based metric (fig. 6). This further highlights the importance of comparing the proposed technique to pre-existing works."
