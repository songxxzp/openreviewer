I don't think this is correct, specifically is FODE using any metric space different from \"Euclidean\", shouldn't it be just contrasted by mentioning in the data space or something like that? If one uses to choose specifics, these need to be pointed out, mentioning terms vaguely isn't helpful\n\n2) It is mentioned that \"time differentiation in the Fourier domain simplifies the modeling of dynamics as it becomes a multiplication operation\". I believe author's refer to the convolution property in this case. Is this even being used implicitly and/or explicitly if not, what is the point of mentioning some property. DFT has many properties, if they are not used, these shouldn't be presented as if they are helping the proposed method in any way.\n\n3) What is $T$ in equation (1)? Should it be $t_1$ instead?\n\n4) Eqn (3) is wrong, I will consider this as typo.\n\n5) So, DFT from eqn (4) is being performed along the feature dimension, if this is the case, what do frequency even mean in this case? If authors can clarify this, it would be great.\n\n6) In experimental result, comparison to a frequency space based method is something that I would like to see. If nothing else [2] can be a good baseline, any comment on this one?\n\n7) I would expect time-series classification results be evaluated on accuracy and not MSE, table 3. Why is the choice for MSE justified for classification task?\n\n8) In Table (2) what is the result for NODE with comparable parameters, can the authors discuss this briefly if possible?\n\n9) Figure 4 is good, this is expected, but is there any further analysis that authors plan to present?\n\n10) I am not sure about the utility of Figure 5, this needs to be explained and justified better."

There are a large family works following Fourier Neural Operators, Deep Operator Networks, and Koopman operators in this direction. Authors have not discussed or compared the results with any of these works in the manuscript.\n\nW2. The experimental systems taken in the work are not very complex. In NODE-based works and in FNOs, much more complex time-series systems such as fluid flow, weather forecasting, complex dynamical equations etc. are considered. However, the first three examples considered in this work are fairly simple equations resulting in 1D dynamics. The ECG dataset is a realistic dataset that is reasonably complex. However, this is again 1D. It is not clear how well the system will scale to larger and more complex problems.\n\nW3. The baselines considered are fairly simple ones that are not truly SOTA. Authors should compare the results with FNO, DeepONet, or such frameworks which are considered to be SOTA.\n\nW4. NODE is essentially a physics-informed approach which requires the integration of the equation of motion to obtain the time-series modeling. FNO is a purely data-driven approach which allows to predict $x_{t+1}$ directly from $x_{t}$ without any integration. By combining Fourier approach with ODE, it seems that the disadvantages of the NODE are still retained. That is, the time integration is still limited by the time-step and hence rollout over a large time window might be challenging.\n\nW5. There is no discussion on the limitations of the present work.

Can't the model predict the $x_{t+1}$ directly from $x_t$? Please clarify? If this is a hyperparameter, how does the model work when the only data point is used to predict the future?

The model reduces the difficulty of modeling complex systems by simplifying the differentiation operation to a multiplication operation in the Fourier domain, making it simpler to capture short-term and long-term dependencies in the data. An element-by-element filtering technique is also introduced in the article to keep the data fine-grained and to exploit the generalization capabilities of continuous models, an innovation that is crucial for the accuracy of time series analysis. Through experimental comparisons, FODEs outperform existing continuous and discrete time series models in terms of accuracy and generalization ability, and are more economical in terms of the number of parameters, demonstrating efficiency in terms of computational resources and training data requirements. These features make FODEs a promising tool in the field of analysis and prediction of complex dynamic systems."

Problems of model generalization and applicability: Although the article proposes a new method for learning dynamics in the Fourier domain, the generalization and applicability of the method on different types and sizes of time series data are not fully discussed. In particular, the performance and applicability of the FODE model on time series data that are non-periodic or have relatively high signal noise is still a question mark. In addition, the Fourier transform is usually weak for non-smooth signals, which may limit the ability of FODE on complex or non-linear time series data.\n\n2. Model Complexity and Computational Efficiency Issues: Despite the paper's claim that FODE improves on computational efficiency, in reality, the computational complexity of the Fourier transform and inverse transform may increase dramatically as the amount of data increases, especially on real-time or large-scale datasets. The paper lacks an assessment of the computational efficiency of a wider range of computations, such as on multidimensional datasets and the specific advantages and disadvantages compared to other existing methods.\n\n3. Insufficient experimental validation and comparative analysis: while the paper provides some experimental results to support the superiority of the FODE model, it lacks comparative experiments, especially with the latest time series analysis methods. The article does not provide sufficient details of the experimental setup, such as the choice of hyperparameters for the model, training details, and measures to prevent overfitting. In addition, the article does not discuss the confidence intervals or statistical significance of the model in terms of forecasting performance, which reduces the persuasiveness of the experimental results."
