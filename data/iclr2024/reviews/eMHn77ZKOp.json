It starts building the algorithms by borrowing tools from the CMAB-T framework. In particular, extension to arbitrary distributions with finite supports by using the representation of the outcome of a single arm with finite support as multiple binary variables and using an appropriate action selection oracle is interesting.

Verifying the performance of Algorithm 4.1 in simulations would be nice. \n\nAnother weakness is related to the deterministic tie-breaking rule, which is proposed as a way to accommodate non-unique arm reward values. I wonder if there is an application in which this tie-breaking is in the control of the decision-maker instead of its environment. More about this is asked in the questions part of the review. \n\nOther weaknesses are mostly related to presentation issues and pinpointing the difference between the estimators used compared to the ones in the semi-bandit feedback CMAB-T setting.

I will be able to provide a better assessment of the quality of the paper after the authors' feedback. Answers to the following questions are crucial for my reassessment. \n\n- Section 3 rests on the assumption that for any action $S_t$, there is a unique arm achieving the maximum value among all arms in $S_t$. Then, it is argued that this can be extended to the non-unique values using a deterministic tie-breaking rule. My question is about implementation issues regarding this deterministic tie-breaking rule in a recommender system. A user who likes two of the shown movies out of k can randomly decide to watch one of them. Imposing a deterministic tie-breaking rule puts a restriction on the behavior of the user. I wonder if this tie-breaking rule can be justified in practice, specifically for applications in recommender systems, for instance, in the one that I mentioned above. \n\n- How is $q^{\\mu,S}_i$ related to $q^{p,S}_i$ and $\\tilde{q}^{p,S}_i$? \n\n- As a starting point, the authors extend the CUCB algorithm to accommodate for max value and index feedback for the case with Bernoulli rewards and known ordering of values. The claim is that most of the parts of the regret analysis of CUCB for CMAB-T remain valid under the new setting. Is it the case that in max-value max-index feedback, the estimates of base arm outcomes $p_i$ are still unbiased? This seems crucial for event E2 from the previous work Wang & Chen 2017 to apply, which achieves unbiasedness thanks to semi-bandit feedback. \n\n- Please comment on the batch-size dependence of the distribution-free regret bound derived from B.1. Is it the same as cascading bandits upper bound? \n\n- What about batch size independent regret bounds as in Liu et al. 2022, NeurIPS? Is it possible to obtain them under your current assumptions? Does triggering probability and variance modulated smoothness (TPVM) condition hold for your reward function? If so, what is the most general case in your paper so that this assumption holds? If this condition holds, then providing TPVM-based regret bounds will be good."

The learner then observes the incurred reward together with the identity $I_t \\\\in \\\\arg\\\\max_{i\\\\in S_t} X_t(i)$ of any arm achieving such a reward within the action. The authors consider discrete distributions with finite support (always including $0$) for the rewards and propose an algorithm achieving a regret bound for binary distributions that is comparable to previously-known bounds under more informative semi-bandit feedback. The results are first presented for the case of binary distributions with known ordering of arms with respect to the nonzero value in the support, and then generalized by first relaxing the assumption of a-priori known ordering. The paper also discusses extensions to discrete distributions with finite supports and presents numerical results that validate their theoretical findings."

Only the \"event-filtered regret\" is defined, but its definition is deferred to the appendix.

The paper could benefit from exploring more general distributions of arm outcomes. Even if the authors argue about adapting to more general discrete distributions with finite support, these are also quite limited in the applications of their techniques. Furthermore, no theoretical guarantee is provided for there latter distributions, and the proposed reduction is expected to introduce a linear dependence in the support sizes to the regret. This is therefore unfeasible and undesirable for distributions with large enough supports, let alone countably infinite (or even continuous) supports as per many common distributions.\n- The baseline methods used in the numerical results are never explicitly described or properly referenced. It is therefore unclear how meaningful the experimental results are without understanding what assumptions are made in the other algorithms used in the comparison.\n- In line 7 of Algorithm 3.1 it says the learner is able to observe value $v_{i^*}$ of $i^*$ while it might happen that no value is observed if all arms in $S_t$ for a certain round $t$ have realized value equal to $0$.\n- Some of the main ideas adopted in this paper, while adjusted to fit a setting with simpler distributions but less informative feedback, seem to be taken directly from Chen et al.

In addition to being unambiguous about cumulative vs instantaneous, regret vs pseudo-regret, you mentioned approximation algorithms for the general offline problem and so it becomes ambiguous if you are working with regret or an $\\alpha$-regret (and if so specifically a $\\alpha=1-1/e$ regret or an $\\alpha=1-\\varepsilon$ regret).  \n\n- Relatedly, page 5 is the first place \u201capproximation oracle\u201d is mentioned once in the text before the Alg 3.1 pseudocode but what \u201capproximation oracle\u201d refers to is not formally described.  That should be formally discussed in the problem setup or at least before pseudocode for the algorithm that calls it.  Also, for completeness the procedures that are proposed to be used for an oracle should be formally described (appendix would be fine).\n\n\n- Algorithms \u2013 \n    - (minor) I found the discussion in the text confusing about maintaining confidence bounds on not only $p_i$\u2019s but also $v_i$\u2019s, which are deterministic.  Looking in the pseudocode for the $v_i$\u2019s there aren\u2019t any confidence bounds \u2013 instead the values are set optimistically to $1$ and (since the support is deterministic) updated exactly once on the first time that arm is the maximizer (if that occurs).  Calling it a confidence bound is confusing in my opinion.\n    - (Minor) \u2013 In Section 3.2 I would suggest linking to the pseudocode earlier, such as at end of second paragraph \u201cDue to limited space, the pseudocode is presented in Algorithm B.1.\u201d  \n\n- I think it would be valuable to have a fuller discussion of the hardness for the offline setting and corresponding approximation methods (Bernoulli (which seems easy based on (Agarwal et al. (2021))\u2019s DART results), non-Bernoulli binary (you mention can be solved exactly with dynamic programming, but are hardness results known for the non-Bernoulli binary case?), and general (you cite Chen et al. (2016a).) to give the reader a fuller intuition.  E.g. explicitly state that the general offline problem (and non-Bernoulli binary offline problem too) is NP-hard; don\u2019t just state that greedy methods can get an $\\alpha$ approximation.\n\n\n### Experiments\n- Semi-bandit CUCB is good to include; it would be good to also include Agarwal et al. (2021))\u2019s DART since that has  $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ guarantees under bandit feedback when the arms are Bernoulli.  It would probably do worse since its assumptions might not hold for non-Bernoulli arms, but it might be more competitive than UCB.\n- The distributions in the experiments are all binary?  That should be mentioned in the main text.  \n- \u201cthree different arm distributions representing different scenarios\u201d is quite generic and suggests potentially distinct problems (such as modeling three different applications), but the \u2018different scenarios\u2019 are almost identical manually constructed examples with a single arm changed from scenarios 1 to 2 and then from 2 to 3.  That is ok to do but the description in Section 5 should be revised to reflect both of those issues (manually designed and single arm changes from one scenario to another)."

                "value": "1. Motivation \u2013 What would be a motivating application of K-max with the max-index feedback for which the arm supports would be unknown? Elaborate more on how one or multiple applications motivate the problem set up you consider.  The \u2018concrete\u2019 scenario mentioned in the introduction of recommender systems \u201cThe goal is to display a subset of k product items to a user that best fit the user preference. The feedback can be limited, as we may only observe on which displayed product item the user clicked and their subsequent rating of this product.\u201d  For most systems I can think of, the numerical feedback would be on a known, fixed scale (like 1-5 stars, or on a 1-10 scale) meaning the support is identical for all arms and known a priori.\n\n\n\n### Minor \n2. In the contributions, \u201cOur work may be seen as a step towards solving full-bandit CMAB problems with non-linear reward functions under mild assumptions.\u201d  Can you elaborate on that (if that's kept in the main contributions)?  The feedback model and modifications to CUCB to appear specialized for the max reward function and thus the work does not seem extendable to other non-linear rewards."
