                "value": "1. The design choices of some metrics are questionable. First, SPI in Sec. 2.2.1 uses the Euclidean distance between the center positions of two elements as their spatial proximity, which will not work well when one or two of them are quite large. Suppose there are two circles that touch each other. Their perceptual distance is zero, but their center distance is rather large due to their large sizes. Thus, the center distance may not be a proper measure here, and better choices need to be explored, e.g., the minimum distance between two elements. Second, ESS in Sec. 2.2.2 sets score 1 and 2 to simple and complex elements, respectively, but these score values are selected without any theoretical or experimental justification.\n\n2. The design choice of the element appropriateness loss is inadequate. The loss uses the edge length of an element to measure its complexity, which is problematic. While such a loss can penalize complex elements with irregular shapes, it will also give a large penalty score to large simple elements, which also have long edges. \n\n3. A thorough study on accuracy-readability trade-off is missing. As shown in Table 2, accuracy is traded for readability. Given the results, it is natural to ask if it is possible (and how) to find an optimal point between accuracy and readability with the proposed readability objectives. A study should be performed to investigate this question, e.g., by introducing a weight to the accuracy loss and plotting the accuracy and readability scores with respect to various settings of the weight."
