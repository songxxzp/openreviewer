In this way, we can still get different prompts, although they may not be considered as different experts.

For Mixture-of-Expert paradigm, router or routing algorithm is a crucial part. However, the paper doesn't discuss this part clearly. Also, from the optimization goal in Equation (3), it seems like a single test case needs to be run multiple times. If this is the case, I'm wondering if your proposed MoP method will have efficiency issue.\n2. Where do the initial demonstration set and instruction set come from? I know this paper is largely based on APE but it's better to briefly discuss these important details to make the paper self-contained. \"Since our Region-based Joint Search uses APE proposed\nprompts as the candidate set, we save the results from APE runs and reuse them in RBJS to eliminate the randomness in prompt proposals.\" I would suggest defining RBJS first to make readers easier. Also, from this sentence, it seems like the initial instruction set does influence the performance, so it's better to explicitly mention this part and explain a bit.\n3. About the theory part of this paper, how do you go from Equation (5) to Equation (6)?\n4. The experiments are mostly conducted on tasks that have close-ended output. I'm wondering if the MoP algorithm can be applied to more open-ended tasks, such as long-form QA or creative writing."

This method actually assumes that all the potential demos or test queries can be all decomposed by these groups. This causes several problems: (1) how to make sure the given training demos are representative enough to cover all the cases? (2) how to make sure your clustering method is effective in making each cluster homogeneous? (3) how to make sure your generated groups are qualified to support better performance? (4) If each group corresponds to one expert, how to set an optimal number of experts for different clustering methods? How to make sure these experts are representative enough, how to achieve the balance between expert number and efficiency?   \n\nHere is a very simple solution to all the problems raised by W1: ignore/remove the clustering component, and treat all the demos as normal instances that can be represented by a K-dimensional latent space where each dimension corresponds to one expert. I would like to see the feedback from the authors.\n\n\nW2: can I assume that the proposed INSTRUCTION ASSIGNMENT is just the combination of Independent Search and Joint Search? I thank the authors for their insights but it is too straightforward, and there exist more important problems that should be considered. For example, since each expert corresponds to one sub-instruction, there is a pressing need to make sure these instructions are heterogeneous. Achieving this goal is not easy, for example, maybe we should maximize KL divergence among pairs of sub-instructions.

                "value": "The choice of prompt has been shown to be critical for the performance of Large Language Models. Therefore, many recent works have explored how to improve prompting strategies, one of them being prompt optimization. However, this suffers from two problems: first, the optimized prompt only contains an instruction, not demos (few-shot examples), and second, one prompt might not be the best for an entire dataset. This paper proposes a mixture-of-experts prompt optimization strategy to solve these two problems. First, the set of all demos is clustered in embedding space. These clusters, which tend to be semantically meaningful, are then each used to produce an optimized prompt. Then at inference, a sample is associated with a cluster (by measuring distance to centroids in embedding space) and is prompted using the cluster's instruction and demos. The advantage of this strategy is that it utilizes demos, and the instruction in the prompt can include local information that is relevant to its cluster but not necessarily to the rest of the dataset. That is, the proposed instruction per cluster is dependent on the demos belonging to that cluster, so the two components of the prompt complement each other. The paper measures this approach on NLP tasks and finds that it can outperform APE significantly (which samples the demos to create one instruction-only prompt for the entire dataset)."

This might just be a clarity issue though; are you actually only showing the prompt optimizer samples from a given cluster each time (this is what I would expect)? 4.4 makes it sound like you are generating cluster-agnostic instructions and choosing the top 4 based on average performance on the dataset, not on the cluster in particular.\n- I had some concerns about the instructions made available in the Appendix. First, some of them are incoherent (like Expert 2/3 in Table 6), and some of them ask very different things, such as sentence_similarity expert 1/6 asking to create sentences, and expert 3/6 asking to rate sentences. Also, I expected that the main advantage of utilizing the cluster is for the optimized prompt to pick up on some cluster-specific information. For example in Table 4, 3 of the 8 experts have specifications being \"journals, apparel, ..., computer science books\". But expert 1/8's demos appear to be geographic, expert 3/8 is apparel, expert 7/8 is health/medicine. This goes against the intention that the instruction and demos should complement each other. That being said, these prompts might be a byproduct of the APE method not working well.\n- Another shortcoming mentioned in the limitations is the lack of incorporating dependencies; each cluster is individually optimized (at least based on the algorithm description). I am curious if a boosting style approach could help with this, or if you can generate instructions for the kth cluster by conditioning on demos and instructions that do _not_ belong to that cluster (e.g., telling the prompt optimizer that the instruction should be different from these other ones).\n\nClarity: \n- In section 4, APE---both the tasks and the method---is not introduced the first time it is mentioned. I did not have any idea of what to expect of the evaluation tasks, since there was no pointer to a description of them besides an explanation of auto_categorization in 4.2 and an overview of them in 4.5, long after the APE tasks were introduced.\n- It also was not clear what the APE method is, resulting in some confusion of \"APE benchmarks\" versus \"prompts generated by APE\"."
