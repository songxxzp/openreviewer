The scoring function is defined as the cross-correlation of multi-channel ligand and protein scalar fields, and is parameterized by equivariant graph neural networks. The method is benchmarked on two simplified docking-related tasks: decoy pose scoring and rigid conformer docking. The authors demonstrate that their method achieves similar performance to existing scoring functions but with faster runtime. They also highlight the advantages of runtime amortization in virtual screening settings with a common binding pocket."

By precomputing certain coefficients and leveraging the common pocket structure in docking, the total runtime of the method is accelerated, making it more efficient for large-scale docking tasks.\n\n- The proposed scoring function shows comparable performance to existing scoring functions on two simplified docking-related tasks: decoy pose scoring and rigid conformer docking. In some cases, the proposed method even outperforms existing scoring functions, particularly on ESMFold structures."
