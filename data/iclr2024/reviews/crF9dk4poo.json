The paper's novelty appears to be somewhat incremental, as it combines existing unsupervised feature selection (stochastic gates) with deep clustering, lacking significant novel elements.\n2. The main design of the model lacks a theoretical guarantee. For instance, the reasoning behind choosing an autoencoder (AE) over other self-supervised tasks, such as contrastive learning, requires clarification.\n3. The method's generalizability to unseen data is not adequately explained. Eq. (6) suggests high computational complexity, necessitating a discussion on the complexity for better understanding.\n4. The experiment comparison seems biased. While the proposed method employs strong feature transformation by DNN, competitors like k-means do not. Hence, a fair comparison with state-of-the-art deep clustering models is essential.\n5. It would be beneficial to discuss the model's performance on a large-scale dataset to provide a comprehensive evaluation.\n6. The subscripts in Eq. (6) should be carefully reviewed for accuracy."

In the second stage, a clustering head is trained to predict cluster assignments based on these latent embeddings. The model aims to provide both instance-level and cluster-level explanations by selecting a subset of features that are most informative for each cluster. The paper validates the model's performance through a series of experiments conducted on synthetic datasets, including well-known benchmarks like MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR10. The experiments show the model outperforms other clustering strategies while maintaining interpretability. The paper also includes ablation studies to understand the impact of various components of the model on its performance."
