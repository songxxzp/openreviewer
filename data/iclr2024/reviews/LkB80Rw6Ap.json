It creates an anonymous version of GitHub repositories. \n\nOn page 3 you say the formation of curvature in Topping et al. is to improve expressiveness. Could you elaborate? My understanding was that it was to improve computability. \n\nThe formatting for Banerjee, Kardhakar, and Montufar 2023 makes it look like two separate papers above equation 2, and drops the name of the first author Banerjee in other places. This needs to be fixed.\n\nJust above equation 4, $\\pi$ is not a measure for this paper. Also I would recommend not using $\\pi$ to represent a scalar different from the constant $\\pi$. The prior work cited uses $\\alpha$.\n\nFor equation 5, you are missing the restrictions on the marginals of $M$ as well the restriction that $M$ is a probability measure on the product space.\n\nHow is the two hop $\\beta^+$ defined?\n\nI also do not understand how Figure 2D is the 2hop *positive message passing*. What do the dashed lines represent? The message also propagated further for the regular message passing framework. Which is contrary to the caption of Figure 2. \n\nFor 1 hop message passing. It says that sparsifying the graph **reduces** the diameter of the graph. This is just blatantly false. For example, for the graph graph used, removing either the positive or negatively curved edges results in the graph being disconnected which makes the diameter infinite."

Oversmoothing has a mathematical definition, thus it would be beneficial to prove or show experiments that back these claims up.\n- Some passages and \"results\" seem unrelated or at least not well discussed. For example, in Table 1 the authors show the homophily gains by considering a different computational graph (that has only negatively or positively curved edges). How does this relate to the remainder of the work?\n- There are many details missing, e.g., the model itself in Equation 7 doesn't include the multi-hop propagation.\n- The experimental section is weak. Only one hyperparameter configuration is used. There should be many hyperparameters tested. Otherwise there is also no need for having a validation set, and also it may be that the baseline methods are not well evaluated. For instance, other papers ([1,2]) report much higher numbers.\n- Also regarding the experiments: As the work claims to tackle oversmoothing, it may be beneficial to compare the method to other works that tackle oversmoothing, see, e.g., [1-5]\n- While the authors refer to (Pei et al., 2020) for their experimental setup, they do not use the setup therein.
