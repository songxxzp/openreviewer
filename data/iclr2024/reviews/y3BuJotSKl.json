                "value": "The paper proposes a defense method named \"Target Manipulation Manifold\" (TMM) to defend against adversarial attacks in deep learning models. This method effectively defends against adversarial attacks by guiding the gradient on the target data manifold toward carefully designed trapdoors. The trapdoors are assigned an additional class label (Trapclass), making the attacks easily identifiable. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can detect ~99% of attacks without significantly compromising clean accuracy. It also exhibits adversarial semantic preservation and robustness to non-adversarial perturbations."

The TMM approach offers a fresh perspective on adversarial attack defense, employing a unique \"trapdoor\" mechanism to detect adversarial samples. \n2. The experimental section is comprehensive, covering a variety of datasets and adversarial attack types, showcasing the superiority of this approach over existing methods.\n3. This detection algorithm avoids learning a separate attack detection model, thus maintaining semantic alignment with the original classifier.\n4. The design of TMM allows it to be easily integrated into various deep learning models without the need for significant modifications to the original model structure."

The \"Trapclass\" filter mentioned in the paper primarily detects untargeted attacks, while the \"Entropy\" filter mainly identifies attacks that strive to minimize perturbation. Such a design might not be stable under certain specific attack strategies.\n2. It is crucial to evaluate the efficiency and speed of the algorithm when considering applying the method to large-scale datasets or real-time application scenarios. The paper doesn't seem to delve deeply into this aspect. \n3. The L function in the article combines multiple loss components, but it does not clearly state how these components interact or how their weights are balanced.\n4. The paper mentions different thresholds (such as \u03be and \u03c1) used for detecting and identifying adversarial samples. However, the selection of these thresholds appears to be based on experience rather than systematic optimization. For these hyperparameters, the article does not provide a sensitivity analysis of their impact on the results, nor does it give clear guidance on how to choose these parameters for different datasets or tasks.\n5. During the model training process, the setting of triggers is randomly selected. This raises the concern of whether some genuine data might be mistakenly identified as data containing triggers, leading to false alarms. Additionally, this random selection introduces a level of uncertainty. After numerous attempts, an adversary might be able to identify and bypass these triggers. Researchers should consider using a more stable and reliable method for setting triggers and balance the pros and cons of randomness and determinacy when designing."

The defenses are split among two threat models: 1) the live-attack model, in which a defender receives an adversarially-perturbed image and its label at each step of the attacker's optimization, and 2) the standard 'offline' model.

                "value": "**Style Issues:**\n\n- A lot of the tables + figures feel insufficiently described. Non-exhaustive list:\n    - The units for the FP column in the tables is unclear\n    - There are no units or explanations of Table 5.\n    - It\u2019s quite hard to see what is being shown in Figure 2 (and looks like the markings were made with pen)\n    - Figure 2 claims a 2x2 checkerboard pattern when the image shows a 4x4\n    - In a final version of the paper it would be great to add more detail to each Table.\n- If I\u2019m understanding the \u201cLoss function for trapdoor\u201d section, the authors are applying fixed patch to a random location in the image with parameterized \u2018faintness.\u2019 The explanation of this feels notation-heavy when it perhaps does not need to be. For example most of the variables in $(1 : ch, k : k+m, l : l+n)$ on page 4 are not defined at the point of introduction, and the notation is nonstandard (I think).\n    - In general, the loss function seems to be a sum of CrossEntropy Losses over three datasets, I wonder if this can be state more compactly.\n- Citations are often formatted weirdly / incorrectly. For example \u201cZhain et. al. Zhai et al. (2019)\u2026\u201d on Page 3.\n- Some terms in the Introduction like \u201cintermediate class labels\u201d are used without definition until later.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- One of the major points of confusion for me was that the threat model is unclear. In particular, it is unclear what the defender knows about the attack. Do they have an epsilon in mind? Do they know an attacker\u2019s parameters? Do they know an attacker\u2019s algorithm?\n- My initial read is that the work is not well-differentiated from adversarial training regimes. In essence they train on three datasets (via a parameterized loss) one of which is clean, and two of which are altered in traditional ways. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from the authors on this point\u2014may be a misread on my end. However, in any case, this distinction could be better addressed.\n- The experimental section feels somewhat limited. One of the major claims of the paper is that their defense works on many attacks, but the analysis of an attacker\u2019s parameters ($\\epsilon$, learning rate, etc\u2026) is limited to a single case in the main text. It\u2019s unclear to me whether their method is robust to a higher learning rate attacker that \u2018jumps\u2019 over their trap-ring regions in the training data.\n    - Their method is based on an attacker \u2018landing\u2019 an adversarially perturbed point in the trap-ring of a training datapoint, but it feels like this inevitability can easily be countered by the attacker using a larger step-size to avoid trapdoor region all-together. This potential limitation is unaddressed.\n- Since the trap-rings are based on training data it seems that low-incidence in-distribution data is at risk of flagging an attack, raising some fairness questions. As an example, how does the model perform on dogs whose breed doesn\u2019t appear in the training set. These datapoints may not be associated with any of training data\u2019s rings.\n    - In particular, I would like to see how the method responds to CIFAR 10.1. It should maintain high performance here, but I\u2019m unsure how the distribution shift will affect the proposed method.\n    - In any case, discussion here would be great!\n- The ablations are limited. Since the method extends prior work, it would be nice to highlight exactly what performance gain their method contributes.\n- Discussion of semantics-preserving transformations is limited. I would like to see the effect of random crops or random flips. These perturbations are semantics-preserving but feel like they would fall outside of the epsilon-balls in the training data. Would these points be ignored?\n- I\u2019m struggling with the motivation behind the live-attack setting. In particular, if the attacker has access to the incremental adversarially perturbed images, couldn\u2019t they identify (in pixel space) a perturbation above a certain $\\epsilon$-threshold (which the defender chooses) that invokes a change in label. This method would not require retraining and require less compute than the proposed method.\n- One of the main defenses proposed (TMM-LA) has very little description associated with it (Page 8 bottom)."

Does the analysis of the trap rings fail when an adversarial point \u2018jumps\u2019 over the trap-ring?\n    - How wide are the trap-rings? How easy is it to land in a trap-ring?\n- What is meant by $(1 : ch, k : k+m, l : l+n)$ on page 4?\n- Please elaborate on the distinction between this and existing adversarial training literature?\n\n\n**Note:** Once the above weaknesses and questions are resolved, I'll raise my score.

                "value": "Making a model robust requires knowledge of allowable noise threshold, which is difficult to quanitfy apriori, and still faces a harsh trade-off betwen accuracy and robustness in practice. Out-of-distribution detectors are difficult to learn for complex datasets since there is usually a benign noise coefficient in observable data. Shortcuts (or Trapdoors) are a task-specific technique for robustifying models without having to specify the allowable noise. Some drawbacks of these techniques are computational complexity and loss of alignment with the main classifier (due to requiring an extra classifier for OOD detection). The authors propose a technique named Targeted Manifold Manipulation (TMM) based on modifying the gradient flow from the manifold around each genuine data point. The key concept is to force perturbed data points to fall into a new \"Trapclass\" label instantiated as a ring in the space around the data point. \n\nThe formulation assumes there is a clean dataset which can be used for synthesizing two new datasets, the robust and trap datasets. The robust dataset is created by applying perturbation artifacts sampled from a predetermined distribution (e.g., uniform) to each sample. The trap dataset is created by overlaying patches (triggers) onto clean instances, which then force the trapped instance to classify as the newly created Trapclass. Multiple triggers are created per image to create the trap-ring effect, each varied by both spatial location coordinates and norm. The classifier observes the three datasets and is tuned by a loss function factorized by each respective dataset. The defense achieves a high detection rate and the base classifier suffers minimal impact to the accuracy."

The additional data burden isn't measured. \n* The evaluation against semantic preserving attack was weak considering previous work already formulated strong perceptual attacks beyond simple brightness and blurring modification [1, 2]. The significance would be improved if the authors compare against these techniques. \n* It isn't clear how well the method works on large-scale data such as full ImageNet, since it is necessary to produce trapdoor pattern for every image. This aspect is not well discussed in the main text, but would impact the trap ring creation since each mask must account for additional locally sparse dimensions (i.e., the trap ring may begin to suffer from curse of dimensionality), making adversarial search easier. \n* There is no comparison to standard robustification techniques such as random smoothing [3] or vanilla adversarial training [4]. Without these it is difficult to measure the impact of the work to the broader community. \n* It is still necessary to pre-define the noise threshold before training, although a higher threshold seems to imply better detection accuracy based on the supplemental results.\n* An important takeaway of [1] is that robustification in one threat model can lead to brittleness in another unseen threat model. My main concern with the defense mechanism is the over-reliance on the genuine data, which may be low quality in practice or in the worst case, suffers poisoning from an adversary. It would be valuable to know the impact of data quality on the detection accuracy, since a real system would have to receive periodic model updates. I would be willing to increase my score if the authors investigated this. \n* The description of the trapdoor mask creation (Loss function for trapdoor) was difficult to follow and could be simplified. Some of the notation seemed superfluous, e.g., trying to describe every span of coordinates and every span of values of the location-parameterized mask. IMO it would be better to just define a tensor $T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{ch\\times m\\times n}$ which is alpha-blended and applied as in Equation 1 centered at a coordinate sampled from a range.
