I think authors should also introduce how to empirically measure the swap property. Since the proposed method relies on regularization to enforce the swap property, which is not guaranteed by design.\n2. The proposed method uses many regularization terms. Some of the regularization terms have ablation studies, but others are not. For example, L_swapper and L_ED are not included. The effect of $\\alpha$ in Eq.~(9) is also not investigated. Moreover, there are four hyperparameters require tuning, making the proposed method hard to tune. \n3.
