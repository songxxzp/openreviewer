As a reader, I feel like I need to understand what this task is about, so there are flaws here. I suggest that the author add an explicit objective function or evaluation metric to the definition.\n\nIn Section 4, the authors introduced two new data sets. The article mentions \"We partition the ICEWS05-15 dataset into six sequential tasks\", dividing the data set into 6 tasks, but does not give each task. The specific distribution of relationships and facts. I suggest that the author provide a table or bar chart in the appendix to show which relationships are included in each task and how many facts each relationship corresponds to.\n\nIn Section 5, the authors proposed the BER method but did not give the dimensions and initialization method of the embedding space. In this part of the content, the content of Figure 1 \"General framework of BER\" was not understood, and no figure was found in the article (Maybe the one in Page 6 is?). For the specific explanation of 1, there are mostly formulas in this section. If you can add some points, I suggest the author add these details in the appendix and explain whether the embedding is normalized or regularized.\n\nIn Section 6, although the author has done many experiments and has many results, a more detailed analysis and explanation of these results may also help readers better understand the effectiveness and stability of the method."

LKGE [1] constructed four datasets to simulate growth in entities, relationships, and facts, and the two datasets created in this paper appear to be related to the \"RELATION\" and \"HYBRID\" datasets among them. However, this paper does not cite, discuss, or compare with related work like [1].\n\n2. Embedding-based models differ from other class-incremental tasks, as each emerging entity and relation can be considered a growing class that needs to be learned. However, this paper does not delve into the learning of emerging entities.\n\n3. The proposed method lacks novelty. The innovation of the replay and distillation modules is limited.\n\n4. Only a few simple classical methods are listed as comparison methods. Due to the absence of advanced comparison methods, the performance of the proposed method's advancement is questionable.\n\n5. In knowledge graph representation learning, replay-based methods can be time-consuming. However, this paper does not report on model efficiency. If efficiency is not considered, retraining a new model with all the data seems to be a better approach.\n\n[1] \"Lifelong embedding learning and transfer for growing knowledge graphs.\" AAAI 2023."
