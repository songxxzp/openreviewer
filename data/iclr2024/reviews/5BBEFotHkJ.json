You are using A100 GPUs, so why not train on larger problems? It raises concerns about the training efficiency and scalability of the proposed method. Could you report the training complexity of mEGAT compared with baselines?\n\n* In Table 1, the authors directly copy the results from Sym-NCO [3]. Are their training settings the same as yours? If different, please retrain it following their open-source code. Moreover, the results of Sym-NCO on 20 and 50, and that of HGS [4] should be reported.\n\n* For the variable-size generalization, the authors should test on larger sizes (e.g., TSP100+). It is expected that your model (trained on TSP100) performs well on TSP20 and TSP50 due to the (multiresolution) training on low-level graphs.

Handcrafted solvers can comfortably handle problem instances several orders of magnitude larger.\n- When it comes to the multi-scale training component of the method, it is not proven beyond doubt that the observed performance improvements are due to the leveraging of multi-scale information as the authors suggest; the improvement could just be the consequence of effectively training on more problem instances (the original one, and the sub-instances, and the high-level instances) compared to not using multi-scale training.\n- Usually, equivariance (or any inductive bias in general) is mostly useful for improving data efficiency. Since TSP instances can be easily generated synthetically (which the authors themselves do), it does not appear that this use-case is one in which data are scarce, and therefore data-efficiency is an important consideration."

This would be an apples-to-apples comparison which would clarify that the leveraging of multi-scale information is indeed the cause of their method's success, as opposed to just effectively training on more data\n- In general, can the authors clearly state over how many problem instances they train their method, and the baselines?\n- Can the authors elaborate on why they do not also make their method scale-invariant, despite the fact that they correctly point out to scale invariance as being a property of TSP solutions?\n- Could the authors motivate (via the citation of relevant work) their statement that previous learning approaches mostly learn from \"local information\"?\n- In section 4.1, the authors state that \"Many CO problems exhibit spatial locality\"; while this is true for routing problems, it would be appropriate to be more specific and provide some examples. There are many CO problems without any notion of locality (or space) at all.\n- Can the authors clarify what their \"Evaluation time\" metric refers to? Does it include the time for training? And how can it be different for e.g. Kool et al. if the same decoder is used? Since the authors' main architectural contribution is at the encoder level, why would they expect the inference time (assuming that this is what they report) to be impacted by it and be a metric of interest?"
