Though in the experiment results, it doesn't seem to have big issues. It would be good to have comparison on training and testing with the old-fashion chain-of-thoughts style.\n\nHow can the paper claim it can judge multimodal model while the model itself cannot take vision data as input? This does not make any sense.\n\nWhile the paper claims that the conversation capability is retained, it is likely that the training is on the demonstrated question and various model answers presented during training. From the conversation content in Figure 19, the model seems not having conversation on the model's judgement. I don't think this is a good point to emphasize for this paper.\n\nGiven there is already a PandaLM paper, while there are still good points and methods proposed in this paper, the novelty is a little weaker."

The authors designed several data augmentation strategies during fine-tuning to help improve the robustness of JudgeLM. Using these methods, JudgeLM was more consistent than GPT-3.5 and PandaLM when chaning candidate answer order or task formulation. They also examined the scaling of JudgeLM, demonstrating that larger models with more fine-tuning data can achieve better performance."

Moreover, They did not report these metrics on GPT-4, the teacher of JudgeLM, to examine if their proposed data augmentation strategies can also help JudgeLM supercede GPT-4 over these aspects.\n2. The authors argued that providing external knowledge to LLMs can alleviate the lack of related pre-trained knowledge. However, in their experiments, these \"references\" are essentially reference answers. Such information might be too sufficient for any LLM evaluation model, greatly decreasing the difficulty of the task, and is usually not available in most real-life scenarios (with only a few exceptions like judging homework submissions). Although incorporating refenrence answers do improve JudgeLM on validation data without reference, it could be better to conduct experiments where knowledge is injected under their retrieved form, instead of a well-organized answer.\n3. The authors proposed three data augmentation strategies during fine-tuning. Yet among these methods, \"reference drop\" is basically equivalent to controlling the amount of samples with reference support, and thus should be a hyper-parameter of the latter strategy instead of an extra method.\n4. The authors fine-tuned JudgeLM so that the model provides scores before the explanation. This approach could speed up the evaluation when explanations are neglected. However, it could be better to compare the performance between this evaluation form and the explanation-first one *on JudgeLM itself* instead of with the original PandaLM."

This could be more fair to PandaLM, as all models use the same amount of GPU resources (which is the major computation resource).\n2. Why is the data in Table 4 not aligned with the ones in Table 1? According to the paper, it seems like the final JudgeLM was fine-tuned on 100k data, which happened to appear in Table 4. Are there other factors that cause the difference, for example the number of training epochs?\n3.
