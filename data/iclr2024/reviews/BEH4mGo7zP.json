                "value": "1. **Many of the components used in the proposed method are not new.** For example, for surface preparation, the paper just followed the apporoach proposed in [1]. For surface dowmsampling, the paper use DSPoint method.  For latent representation learning, the paper follow Spatial Functa. It seems the proposed method combine several existing modules to get a new pipeline.\n\n[1] Fast end-to-end learning on protein surfaces. CVPR 2021.\n\n2. **The paper lacks some important baselines.** In the main results, the paper only compares to the ablation models, which seems not enough. At least, the paper should compare to [1], [2]. Besides, the paper seems lacks the baseline of directly finetuning ESM-1b (ESM-2). I don't know how much benefits  that adding the additional surface and structure pretraining will bring to directly finetuning ESM series.\n\n[2] LEARNING HARMONIC MOLECULAR REPRESENTATIONS ON RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLD. ICLR 2023.\n\n3. **Some claims are not right.** In the first several lines of page 6, the paper mentioned \"Incorporating these characteristics into the point cloud encoder leads to the formation of embeddings that encompass both the surface\u2019s geometric structure and chemical attributes.\" On the surface, the author only used atom category and distance, which are chemical features. For geometric features, the author may need to calculate Gaussian curvature, mean curvature, heat kernel signature and something like that, which are geometric features. Besides, I think the calim \"pre-training sequence, structure, and surface features\" might be not true because there is no sequence pretraining stage involved. Instead, this paper used pretrained ESM-1b, and continued pretraining based on this model, which is continual learning.\n\n4. **The paper missed some important details.**  For example, in SDF, we need the atom type for the current vertex and its neighbors. However, the author didn't mention what atoms they used. The four atoms on backbone? Or the full 44-kind atoms as in AlphaFold2?\n\n5. **Function evaluation:** It's just a suggestion. One of the most important motivation of this paper is: surface encodes the function of proteins, so involving surface can get better protein representation. Therefore, it's very natural to apply the learned protein representations to prediction the protein functions. However, the paper didn't do such kind of experiments. I suggest the author add some protein function evaluation, such as protein fitness landscape."

But in 5.1, the author mentioned they sampled 500,000 points for each protein. Besides, Does 500,000 sample points refer to the point cloud after downsampling? According to my opinion, using MSMS, there would be 100-120 vertices around each residue, which means 500,000 points at least represents a protein with length 5,000. That is a very long sequence. I don't believe the average minimum length of the pretraining proteins is 5,000.\n\n2. In Figure1, there is surface encoder and sequence encoder. In title 4.1.1, there is protein encoder. In title 4.1.3, there is Transformer encoder. It's kind of confusing. The author may need to unify the name and give an overall description.\n\n3. Why the author used ESM-1b instead of ESM-2. ESM-2 performs better.\n\n4. In Figure 3, is the reconstructed mesh obtained through the donwsampled vertices? And the original one is the one generated by MSMS?"

It employed a series-fusion approach where a model is pre-trained in the order of sequences, surfaces, and structures. Another essential part of the work is in the surface encoder which learns Implicit Neural Representations. The surface encoder is based on a proposed ProteinINR framework which consists of a transformer encoder on top of a point encoder, a structure encoder, and spatial latent representations. The experiments demonstrate that ProteinINR can reconstruct protein surfaces pretty well and the pre-trained representations outperform previous SOTA on several downstream tasks."

While the authors discussed the advantage of INR compared to previous methods to represent surfaces, current experiments do not show how important INR is compared to them.\n- [Experiments] One of the clear weaknesses of the proposed approach is that it eventually relies on pretraining the structure encoder, GearNet. In other words, it's only applicable for downstream tasks where protein structures are known, which might be the most important in a real world. I'm curious whether authors have thought about downstream tasks where only sequences are available and structures are not. It would be interesting to see how the performance of pre-trained models changes with the usage of predicted protein structures (maybe from AlphaFold) instead of the true ones.\n\nMinor comments\n- [Introduction] It would be nice to have more explanation on protein surface characteristics, particularly regarding the relationship between structural features and molecular surfaces. Unfamiliar readers might think that surface information is already well-contained within 3D structures, such that cannot clearly understand the need for incorporating surface information for the pre-training.\n- [Figure 2] xyz seems to indicate coordinates, but it's inconsistent with notations from the texts.\n- [Sec 4.1.1.] Does the protein encoder mean point encoder? Due to the prevalent terminologies (point encoder, structure encoder, protein encoder, etc.), there seems to be a little confusing use of terminologies. The authors might want to take a look into the issue.\n- [Experiments] Can you further provide the performance of ESM-GearNet-INR? It would help to show the effectiveness of INR with sequence pretraining but without structure pretraining.\n- [Sec 5.3] It would be better to explain the Chamfer distance."
