The authors proposed the Prompt-Aware Introverted Attention (PAIntA) layer to make self-attention modules focus more on text-related unmasked regions. Then, the Reweighting Attention Score Guidance (RASG) improved the textual alignment through cross-attention scores. Thus, this paper enjoys better performance with faithful generations."

Whether the over-saturated generation related to PAINTA or self-attention scaling?\n2. Although RASG is highly inspired by Chefer et al. (2023), the authors do not provide further clarification about the difference. Moreover, the effect of some details is not well verified, such as the std-based normalization of RASG. More related works about RASG should be considered. \n3. Except for the over-saturated issue, the quantitative improvement of PAINTA is minor. Does this technique just work for some failure cases such as \"zebra\" in Fig13 of the supplementary? \n4. More in-depth discussions about PAINTA should be discussed. Such as some visualizations about $c_j$ in some representative cases.\n4.

The proposed PAIntA method claims to \"mitigate the too strong influence of the known region over the unknown by adjusting the attention scores of known pixels contributing to the inpainted region\". However, it remains unclear whether the $c_J\\in (0,1)$ parameter effectively reduces this influence, especially considering that the element values of the similarity matrix $A_{self}$ are not always positive. Further discussion is needed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed PAIntA method.\n\n2. The proposed RASG technique appears to bear a resemblance to the work by Chefer et al. (2023). The authors assert the superiority of RASG without presenting theoretical or empirical evidence. Some supporting evidence or comparisons are necessary to substantiate this claim.\n\n3. Since RASG is a classifier guidance technique, it is essential to provide a comprehensive discussion of related works to distinguish RASG from other similar methods. This would help readers better understand its unique contributions and advantages.\n\n4. It is not clear why RASG and PAIntA are applied at different resolutions. Specifically, the rationale for not using RASG in the $H/16\\times H/16$ resolution should be explained.\n\n\n5. Using Poisson blending needs clarification. How do you prevent the original image information from leaking into the inpainting region?"

The motivation is not convincing to me. \u00a0The authors claim that existing technique limitation comes from the visual context dominance over the prompt in self-attention. We suggest the authors visualize or make statistics to verify such a claim.\n\n2\\. The trick used for super-resolution (blending unmasked image) are not new to the community. Some existing works already leverage such technique for image inpainting [https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/stable_diffusion/pipeline_stable_diffusion_inpaint.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/stable_diffusion/pipeline_stable_diffusion_inpaint.py).\n\n3\\. The authors should compare with SmartBrush and Imagen editor, which are also proposed to solve the text alignment problem.\n\n4\\. What\u2019s the difference between the RASG and classifier guidance or self-guidance [1]?\n\n5\\. Some important details are missing to understand PAIntA and RASG fully. For example, what does $i$ mean in Eq(5)? Does it mean text token or image token? What\u2019s the value of c_j in the final setting? What does the update operation in Figure 3(a) mean? We suggest the authors explain it by expressions. What does X0=\\epsilon(I) mean in section 3.5? Is it a decoded latent image for the input image or an upscaled latent?\n\n6\\. In section 3.3 and Figure 3, the authors borrow query and key project layers from the next cross-attention module, and calculate the similarity with selected prompt tokens but still use the value from the image feature, which confuses me. Specifically, the authors consider the prompt as a query, they should also use them as value.\n\n7\\. The experiment results are not that convincing to me. Specifically, \u00a0in Figure 13 in the supplemental results, the authors show some failure cases by using only PAIntA and RASG. It is unclear which is more powerful and why they will fail. Besides, it is also not clear why combining them works better. It seems that combining PAIntA and RASG will also fail in some cases.\n\n\\### [1] Epstein D, Jabri A, Poole B, Efros AA, Holynski A.
