(5), \\eta^[j]=|C_j|/|S_i| seems to depend also on i.\n2) Before section 4.1 it is mentioned that \"the final F_\\beta score is\", but F_b is not presented afterwards.\n3) It is not clear how \\alpha is computed or estimated. This is a major issue in the paper.\n4) The results in Figure 2 and 3 need a much better explanation.\n5) In the plot of Figure 3 the x-axis corresponds to number of clusters, while in the legend it is mentioned that corresponds to cluster size.\n6) Experiments with real datasets would add value to the paper. Also it would be interesting to show how other measures such as NMI compare to the proposed measure."

It is not clear whether this subgraph is the result of B3 or M-B3. After all, in Figure 2 maxB3 is not marked with a yellow circle. It is best to unify the format of all clustering subgraphs. Also, in the top left plot of Figure 3, B3 looks like there is no result in a cluster number of 1-4. It turns out that the results overlap. You need to re-adjust the color of the image to make the results more obvious.\n5. In the last paragraph of the introduction, it is recommended that the author explain the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n6. Should the uncertainty of labels be tested with different types of noise? It is recommended that the author increase the type of label noise to make the method proposed in this article more convincing."

A good metric should be able to discover the true structure of the data more accurately in real data experiments compared to existing metrics, and the paper's experiments do not verify this point.
