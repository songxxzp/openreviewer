The number of qualitative results of 3D generation is too small. All I can find is Figure 2, 7, 20, which contain 9 examples with overlapping prompts (e.g. lions). The Janus problem is very common in score distillation based generation methods, so more such comparisons with a diverse set of prompts should be presented.\n\n3. The qualitative results for view-dependent image generation (Figure 6, 10-18) re-use the same prompts (lion, panda, peacock) over and over again. It is better to use more different prompts to showcase the effectiveness of the method in the wild.\n\n4. The comparison to other methods of 3D generation is limited and incomplete. I only see it in Figure 2 with 3 examples, and the last one for Magic3D does not show obvious difference to me. Weirdly in Figure 7, the captions claims the original Magic3D model fails to generate satisfactory results, but the figures do not show any of these \"unsatisfactory\" results.\n\n[1] Universal Guidance for Diffusion Models, Bansal et al."

The algorithm can be applied to both 2D and 3D generation. The paper shows the effectiveness of Perp-Neg in addressing the Janus problem in 3D object generation, the results show a fair improvement in the success rate of side/back views, leading to more view-consistent 3D objects.
