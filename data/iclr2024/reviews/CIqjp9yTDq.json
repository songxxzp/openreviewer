The result implies $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\kappa})$ acceleration in comparison to SGD when batch size is big.

The novelty is to quantifying bias and variance with some linear operator, and then analyze the property of those linear operators.\n\nAlthough the scope of theoretical investigation is limited at quadratic loss with anisotropic gradient noise, the author justified the broad implication of such assumptions to real applications."

What do you think is the difficulty in extending it to commonly used assumptions (e.g., bounded variance)?\n2. In your first experiment, It seems that SGD performs worse when $M$ gets large. To me it feels that it is because your range of grid search for $\\eta_t$ is invariant for all batchsizes. I'm curious whether SGD performs better when you multiply the stepsize by $\\sqrt{M}$.\n3. Nonconvex models are actually used in the second experiment. Although the authors claim that the strongly convex quadratic optimization model approximates the landscape near local optimum, Figure 1 actually suggests that benefits of momentum are significant at the beginning of the training procedure. Could you elaborate more on this?\n4. Some recent researches show that even without decay of learning rate [1], momentum SGD also outperforms SGD using large batch size. What do you think might contribute to this phenomenon?\n5. I would suggest the authors remove (or delay to the end of the appendix) proofs for auxiliary results, most of which are well-known results. Some notations should be properly defined (such as $\\mathbf{X} \\succeq \\mathbf{Y}$ and Hessian norm $\\\\|\\cdot\\\\|_\\mathbf{H}$)\n\n**Minor typos and stylistic issues**\n\n1. Algorithm 1.
