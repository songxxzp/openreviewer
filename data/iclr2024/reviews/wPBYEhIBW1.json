Is as if this is the first clustering paper. The baselines/concepts used are text-book material, again, as if someone has ignored thousands of papers for clustering and anomaly detection. It's unclear what is trully novel.\n\n- Tons of baselines missing from clustering and anomaly detection areas\n\nBoth areas are enormous, with thousands of papers, and potential baselines. The paper compares with methods found in textbooks, which is \"intro to ML/data mining\" level material. Datasets in most cases are synthetic when we have again dozen of real-world datasets. \n\nThe paper needs improvements in every way, writing, stronger experiments, experimental settings, clarifying novelty, stronger/recent baselines, more real-world datasets."
