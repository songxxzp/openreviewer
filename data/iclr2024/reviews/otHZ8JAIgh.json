This is to be appreciated by any fellow researchers looking to get understanding of the available survival prediction methods in CPath.\n- Probabilistic modeling of the bag of patch features (although it leads to several variational approximations), opens up new avenues for probabilistic approaches for CPath, which have been under-explored thus far."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Clarity\n- The explanation around PIB and PID need to be much more straightforward for the work to be appreciated. In its current form, it is really hard to understand and Section 3 lacks clarity. The authors should understand that typical readership of this article will either be pathologist or ML practitioner who would be less-versed in probabilistic and variational language. This, in my opinion, significantly reduces the impact of the paper as any other researcher hoping to reuse the framework for their own experiments. Authors should try to inject more  pathology-related intuition throughout the work.\n\nDiscriminative assumption\n-  I am not sure if \"discriminative\" approach (despite its good performance as shown in the paper) is the right approach for survival. Different from diagnosis problems where subtype/grades are indeed decided with discriminative instances (patches), survival prediction problems are not as clear-cut. Certain morphological characteristics will overlap between different risk groups (or bands), which the current approach, centered around sampling positive/negative prototypes for maximum discrimination, is not well suited for.\n- Related to the comment above, this approach seems only applicable to NLL loss, which treats the problem as a classification problem and thus have \"different\" bins (i.e., discretized timeline). What if more common loss functions, such as Cox PH or rank losses, were to be used that do not rely on such discriminative hypothesis?\n\nKaplan-Meier analysis\n- In Kaplan-Meier analysis section, authors state that \"our approach demonstrates significantly improved discrimination.... as indicated by lower p-values\". While it is tempting to compare between p-values as a metric for separation of the risk groups, it is statistically not correct. Once these are below significance threshold, it shouldn't be over-interpreted. Maybe, use median survival days for each risk group?\n\nSampling operation\n- Since both PID and PIB rely on sampling from distribution, it does seem that the performance will indeed by affected by which samples are chosen or how many of them are sampled. The discussion around this point needs to be made explicit.\n\nInference\n- While there are detailed information about training procedure, not much is written about the actual inference step. For instance, how many samples for each prototype are required for reliable performance?"

(4)? Wouldn't this simply be a matter of backpropagation in the training, which is scalable to numerous instances?\n- Variational approaches involving NNs are known to be prone to mode collapse - What are the tricks/methods used in the work to prevent it?\n- I think the introduction of Markov chains confuses the paper more - Perhaps better to remove it.\n- Eq. (6) - Can't we simply use KL divergence to assess the similiarity (distance), if both p(z|x) and p(\\hat{z}|y) are normal distributions?\n- Usually the use of \"Top-k\" refers to small number of instances being selected. However, from implementation section, it seems the authors are using 50~80% of the entire bag? Am I misunderstanding something?"

In particular, this work compares with many state-of-the-art multimodal methods such as MCAT (both concatenation and Kronecker Product), SurvPath, MOTCat, and other relevant information bottleneck-related works. Beyond ABMIL and TransMIL, other strong unimodal methods such as the task-specific finetuning variant of CLAM is also considered. Background information and literature is also extensive, with many important studies related to PIBD cited in a comprehensive manner.\n- The proposed PID and PIB methodology, though largely adapted and inspired by other IB applications in computational pathology such as that of Li et al. 2023, is (on balance) appropriate for its extension into survival analysis w.r.t. addressing sparsity of patch features in MIL via prototypes. Figure 1 is informative and communciates how PID/PIB are used."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- **Limited findings w.r.t. clinical application / multimodal interpretability**: PID/PIB is intuitive for solving multimodal integration problems of WSIs and gene sets, but the demonstrated findings of this work appears limited to only improvement of c-Index performance. Methodologies such as MOTCat and SurvPath, though not approaching survival analysis from an information bottleneck perspective, similarly resolve issues regarding redundancy of patch features in MIL and reach similar findings already established in prior works. The interpretability experiments, shown as attention heatmaps in the supplement, are difficult to interpret and draw conclusions from. As the improvement in c-Index is minor, it would be valuable to investigate the interpretability of PIBD, for example: (1) performing local and global interpretability to assess individual and cohort-level image-omic drivers of disease survival, or (2) experiment+showcase unique clinical applications that would arise from PIBD that cannot be performed in other methods, which would produce new scientific findings and expand this study's significance. In particular, I found the prototypical aspect of this work to be intriguing, with concurrent works also realizing (and finding new applications) of using prototypical patterns for pathology [5].\n- **Ablation Experiments for PIB/PID**: Some baselines do not seem fair in the PID/PIB ablation experiments.\n- - In ablating PID, the baseline model considered was average pooling the prototypical features - a more appropriate baseline would be to use a non-disentangled Transformer like TransMIL on top of the prototypical features. \n- - In ablating PIB, the reviewer is not certain what the baseline looks like (using PID without PIB), but would think that this comparison would be similar to having each modality being processed by a TransMIL-like encoder + PID (or SurvPath + PID). \n- **Using CTransPath for TCGA evaluation**: A limitation of this study is the usage of CTransPath (pretrained on TCGA) for training and evaluating MIL models for survival analysis in TCGA. Understandably, access to powerful pretrained encoders for pathology is challenging, due to: (1) lack of computing power, and (2) lack of diverse and independent data outside of TCGA, with other studies in computational pathology such as Jaume et al. [1] and Filliot et al. [2] having also conducted survival analyses via TCGA-pretrained encoders. This limitation could remain as \"a limitation of this study\" (fitted in the conclusion) as the novelties of this work are with respect to the MIL encoder (all comparisons are performed using the same features and evaluated in the same way), in combination with the aforementioned challenges in computational pathology. However, as the broader pathology and machine learning community is becoming more aware of potential biases that emerge from data contamination of self-supervised models that are also trained using the evaluation data (as seen in LLMs and other studies [3-7]), it is important for advances going forward to recognize and resolve this issue and to develop better standardization for developing and evaluating MIL methods. \n\nReferences\n1.

As cross validation is used to generate the evaluation results, to what extent were the hyperparameters selected using the evaluation datasets and is there risk of selection bias as a result?"
