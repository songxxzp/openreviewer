This setting  is motivated by recent applications such as image to text mapping.  For their target function, they assume that it belongs to certain gamma smooth spaces, which can be thought as extensions of mixed Besov spaces and anisotropic Besov spaces to infinite dimension output.  They consider learning this class of functions using dilated CNNs, which consists of multilayer convolutions followed by fully connected neural networks. Assuming that the ERM can be constructed, they characterize the approximation and estimation rates, and show that dilated CNNs achieve the minimax optimal rate for norm $p \\geq 2$. They further prove a lower bound for linear estimator, which shows that dilated CNNs have better rates under some conditions."
