First, the paper focuses on a benchmark--namely heads-up no-limit Poker--that has been essentially already solved, meaning that prior work has already come up with techniques to find superhuman strategies in that game. It would be much more meaningful if the authors used their new algorithm to make progress on a benchmark that has been otherwise elusive using prior techniques. The second issue is that the comparison is not made with the state of the art models (Libratus and Deepstack). If I am not mistaken those models are not publicly available, but it is a significant weakness if the new approach does not attain state of the art performance. Do the authors know how Libratus or Deepstack performs against either Rebel or Slumbot? That would given an indication of how the new approach performs against Libratus or Deepstack. Remaining on the comparison drawn in the paper, one issue here is that Rebel was not tailored to Poker; the point of ReBel was to have an agent that performs well across many different benchmarks, so a comparison with an agent designed specifically for Poker might not be appropriate. Furthermore, Slumbot is not a particularly strong agent compared to either Libratus or Deepstack."

The pseudocode is provided, but the reader has to walk it through by themselves. \n\nThe experiments could be stronger if it considered a baseline that uses the abstraction by Hawkin et al. within the same Rebel framework. The paper hypothesizes that such a learning process would be slow because the abstraction changes in every iteration. To be honest, I don't see how this would be different with the proposed approach. Seeing learning curves of different versions of the system would dismiss any doubts about the contributions of the proposed method. \n\nThe paper makes it sound that this system can be used end-to-end with little to no human intervention. However, the method critically depends on human knowledge to even define the possible action abstractions, the set of \"must-have\" actions, and the default action abstraction that guides the RL process of learning a better abstraction. For example, how would the method behave if we removed the default action abstraction, so in the beginning of learning the method would do what RL algorithms do, which is to randomly select action abstractions?"

The decisions of this fourth player would be the selection of the abstraction used. How different would this be from the RL formulation in the current approach? \n\nInstead of looking at the difference between the current action abstraction and the default abstraction, why not use a reward function that depends only on the value $v$ of the current abstraction?"

While the authors mention that using a smaller $\\mathcal{AA}_{base}$ as in Moravc\u00b4\u0131k et al., 2017, leads to a decrease in win rate, it is also known that using a larger abstraction does not necessarily lead to improved solution quality.

The tested application in experiments is only poker, and no other abstraction algorithm is used.\n* As an aside, the cost of running ReBel every time the action abstraction changes during RL seems enormous, and the result that the learned abstraction is better than a fixed one is not very surprising.\n\n**\"This two-phase framework, named RL-CFR, effectively trades off computational complexity (due to CFR) and performance improvement (due to RL) for IIEFGs\"**\n* Again, as far as I understand, there is evidence that RL-CFR increases performance at an increased cost, but I don't see evidence of the ability to trade off complexity for performance.

I don't understand how a PBS reduces the size of the state space, and, as far as I understand, all variants of CFR treat strategies as common knowledge.\n* In the last paragraph of section 3, it might help to explain *how* a PBS can be interpreted as a history in a perfect information \"analogue\" of some IIEFG.\n* The claim \"Which effectively combines DRL with CFR to achieve a good balance between computation and optimism\" is difficult to interpret.

(Action abstraction is mainly applied to the game of poker, where it means choosing the \"discretization\" of bet sizes into somewhere around 1 to 5 bet sizes.)\n\nThis paper extends the depth-limited search method ReBeL which uses self-play to train public belief state (PBS) value nets. In this paper, the novel algorithm RL-CFR takes in a pretrained PBS value net from running standard ReBeL self-play training. RL-CFR then does its own self-play training loop to train an action-abstracter RL agent. The self-play training loop is like the ReBeL self-play training loop, but the RL agent is being trained, not the PBS value function. On each move during the self-play training loop, the RL agent picks the action abstraction that will be used to do search for that move. Then ReBeL search is performed for the search tree. ReBeL search is also performed for the search tree that uses a default action abstraction. For each of the two solved search trees, we get some equilibrium value for the turn player. The reward to the RL agent is the difference between those two values. \n\nThe RL agent is implemented with a deep neural net. Experiments are performed with head-to-heads against a replication of ReBeL and against Slumbot 2019. Experiments are also performed with exploitability calculations on river endgames, compared against the replication of ReBeL. RL-CFR beats the ReBeL replication on all experiments."

The paper mentions that the method here will lead to \"performance improvement\" (and obviously it's implicit in this paper that the goal is to get a better policy), but it's not described anywhere what this means or why this method will lead to it. \n\n- In lieu of any **theory** showing that this method should lead to a stronger or more optimal policy, there should be some **intuition** for why this method would lead to a stronger or more optimal policy. However, there is none given in the paper. *In particular, I have no intuition for why the given definition of reward (Section 4, page 6) will lead to a better policy in the game.* (Yes, it's intuitive that one way to increase the root PBS value is by picking an action abstraction that lets the turn player compute a less-exploitable strategy. But another way to increase the root PBS value would be by picking an action abstraction that prevents the other player from computing a less-exploitable strategy. It seems we should only care about the former, not the latter. But might maximizing the latter interfere with maximizing the former?)\n  - This method clearly seems to perform better, as per the experiment results. Can you speculate on why RL-CFR seems to do so much better?\n\n- The abstract and introduction state that \"RL-CFR defeats ReBeL, one of the best fixed action abstraction-based HUNL algorithms\". Unfortunately, I think it would be more accurate to clarify that these head-to-head experiments were performed against a replication of ReBeL, since Table 1 shows that the replication achieves a lower head-to-head winrate against Slumbot than the ReBeL from Brown et al., 2020.\n\n- The motivation for wanting to use RL in the Introduction doesn't really make sense to me. The motivation for using RL seems to be hinting towards wanting to use RL for the sake of using RL, rather than for some well-defined reason. I suppose this calls back to my earlier point: it's not clear what the goal is. Is the goal to create an agent that plays a lower-exploitability strategy (i.e. closer to Nash equilibrium)? Then how does the motivation in the Introduction (\"Reinforcement learning has been shown to be a revolutionary method in many games\") connect to this goal?\n  - Similarly, phrasing elsewhere seems to imply that we have as a presupposed goal the desire to implement Deep RL somehow for IIEFGs. But why do we have this goal in the first place? See: Section 5 \"It is important to note that applying the DRL approach to IIEFGs is highly nontrivial. The key challenge comes from the fact that one has to decide the action probability distributions for all information sets...\" -- I don't get the point of this sentence (also, the \"key challenge\" isn't super clear to me). \n\n- Section 4 (State): This section should clarify that the PBS to PS reduction is lossy. Indeed, while I think that defining state as the PBS satisfies the Markov assumption, I'm not so sure if PS as state does. If convergence or optimality were touched upon in this paper (they should be!) then this choice of PS rather than PBS may introduce a problem. \n\n- The paper would benefit greatly from qualitative results showing examples of action abstractions chosen by the RL agent. \n\n\nMinor:\n\n- Section 3 (Public Belief State): \"In general, a PBS is described by the joint probability distribution of the possible infostates of the players\", but \"PBS $\\beta$\" seems to be defined as the marginal probability distributions for each player. In poker, you can go from the marginal distributions to the joint distribution, but this is not always the case, right? If so, this should be clarified.\n\n- Section 4 (MDP definition): The state, actions, and rewards are defined for this MDP, but as far as I can see, the state transitions are not defined anywhere. I can read between the lines and infer from Algorithm 1, but it would be much clearer if it were defined here.\n\nNitpicks / typos:\n\n- Introduction typo: \"may depends on\" should be \"may depend on\"\n- Introduction: \"To tackle the above challenge\" -- should it be \"To tackle the above challenges\"? As-is, it implies that RL-CFR tackles the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in a game. However, ReBeL alone already solves this problem. With the plural \"challenges\" it would mean that RL-CFR tackles both the problem of finding the Nash equilibrium in a game, and also the problem of picking an action abstraction. Perhaps it would also be clearer to clarify that ReBeL alone already \"handles the aforementioned mixed-strategy and probability-dependent reward issues\". \n- Introduction: \"by significantly win-rate margins\" should be \"by significant margins\" or \"by significant win-rates\"?\n- Section 2: The acronym \"EGT\" should be expanded.\n- Section 2: RL with regularization-based payoff functions should also cite:\n   - \"A Unified Approach to Reinforcement Learning, Quantal Response Equilibria, and Two-Player Zero-Sum Games\", Sokota et al (MMD)\n   - Neurd and R-nad and stratego:\n       - \"From poincar\u00e9 recurrence to convergence in imperfect information games: Finding equilibrium via regularization\", Perolat et al. \n       - \"Neural Replicator Dynamics: Multiagent Learning via Hedging Policy Gradients\", Hennes et al.\n       - \"Mastering the Game of Stratego with Model-Free Multiagent Reinforcement Learning\", Perolat et al.\n  - In Section 3, quotation marks around \"player\" are facing the same direction.\n- Section 3 (PBS): \"At the beginning of a subgame, a state is sampled...\" -- should this be \"a history is sampled\"? Since \"state\" is ambiguous (being used in the previous sentence in a different sense), whereas a history is rigorously defined.\n- Section 4: \"... is used to select an action abstract\" should be \"... is used to select an action abstraction\"\n- Section 5: \"non-chance and non-terminate\" should be \"non-chance and non-terminal\". Same for Footnote 5.\n- Section 5 \"transform a high-dimensional PBS $\\beta$ into a low-dimensional public state $s$\": I think this should be more clear that the \"transformation\" is a lossy one. Maybe by using a more specific verb than \"transform\"? \n- Section 6: \"our conduct experiments\" should be \"we conduct experiments\"\n- Section 6: It would be helpful to clarify which CFR variation is used in the experiments here. (I see that it is clarified in the Appendix, but it would be useful to note here as well.)\n- Section 6: typo: \"We evaluate the performance of RL-CFR and ReBeL under the common knowledge in HUNL.\"\n- Section 6: typo: \"the agent know\" should be \"the agent knows\"\n- Section 6: \"We evaluate the performance of RL-CFR and ReBeL\" should clarify that this paragraph is regarding head-to-head evaluations of RL-CFR vs. ReBeL, not merely comparisons between them on some common metric. (That's what this paragraph is about, right?) And \"RL-CFR achieves 64 mbb/hand win-rate compared to the replication of ReBeL\" should be \"versus the replication of ReBeL\" instead of \"compared to the replication of ReBeL\".\n- Section 6: typo: \"We also comapre RL-CFR\" should be \"compare\"\n- Appendix D: \"In fact, the origin\" should be \"original\"\n- Appendix D: typo: \"Brown & Sandholm (2016a)\" should be in parentheses?\n- Appendix D: The second paragraph describes depth-limited solving, but Libratus is mentioned, even though it doesn't do any depth-limited subgame solving. \n- Appendix D: \"resolve the strategy based on new action abstraction\" -- should this also cite the original ReBeL paper?\n- Appendix E: Figure 3: typos \"Non-Ternimal\", \"Ternimal Node\", \"In each iterator\" (should be \"iteration\")\n- Appendix E: typo: Footnote 19 in the main text is displayed as \". 19.\""

            "questions": {
                "value": "- I think the river endgame experiments are interesting, and would like more details. Do you have 95% confidence intervals for the results? Can you expand on footnote 9: did you play each scenario twice: once as normal, and once where ReBeL and RL-CFR switch places? Could you do river endgames sampled from ReBeL vs. ReBeL preflop-through-turn, or RL-CFR vs. RL-CFR preflop-through-turn, instead of mixed?\n\n- The abstract and Introduction say that \"RL-CFR effectively trades off computational complexity (due to CFR) and performance improvement (due to RL)\". What is this trade-off? Does RL-CFR have less computational complexity and more performance improvement? This seems like it might be excessively hand-wavy?\n\n- In the introduction: \"RL-CFR has a wider range of applicability and faster convergence\". Where is this faster convergence experimentally demonstrated or proved? What convergence is being referred to here?\n\n- In Introduction: RL-CFR achieves \"a good balance between computation and optimism\". Is this expanded upon in the paper? I would love to hear more about this. \n\n- Section 4: \"Our design is inspired by (Brown et al., 2019), which transforms high-dimensional public belief states into low-dimensional public states.\" Can you expand on this? I couldn't find what you were referring to.\n\n- Do we use a discount factor for the RL agent in experiments? Is it just 1?\n\n- In the original ReBeL paper, they show that they can simplify the PBS from perfect recall (encoding the previous actions of the two players) to imperfect recall (only encoding the stack sizes of the two players). In this paper, footnote 3 implies that the public state used here does encode the previous actions of the two players. Is this true?\n\n- It's said in Section 4 (State) that the PBS dimensionality is very large, so we reduce it to the PS for our MDP. However, in terms of deep RL, is the 2,500 dimensionality really a problem? Would it have caused the experiment time to increase by a lot if the PBS was used instead of PS? Also, the PBS value net which takes in a PBS is still trained during ReBeL replication self-training, and used for inference during RL-CFR, right? So doesn't that mean that a deep neural net which takes a PBS as input is tractable?\n\n- In Section 4 (State): \"The selection of public states has the additional advantage that the public states of the non-root nodes are fixed during the CFR iterations...\" Why does this matter? If I understand correctly, the PS is only needed for the root node, in order to get the action abstraction *before* CFR is started.\n\n- Will the code be open-sourced? It's difficult to evaluate whether everything was implemented without error because there are so many possible pitfalls with implementing a complex system like ReBeL.\n\n- In fact, the head-to-head results versus Slumbot imply that the ReBeL replication does not match ReBeL from the original paper. Do you know or hypothesize why this is?\n\n- Why do you let the action abstraction agent choose to have fewer than K additional action abstractions? Should it not always be \"better\" to have more bet sizes in your abstraction?\n\n- Section 6: Paragraph 3 (PBS value network training) -- was this done via self-play as in ReBeL? If so, are the details of the training process exactly the same as ReBeL?\n  - As just one example of a detail: are the depths of the subgames during self-play defined exactly as they are in the ReBeL paper?\n\n- Section 6: \"In addition, the PBS value networks used for all our experiments are trained based on the default action abstraction.\" Does this mean that randomly modifying bet sizes during self-play as in the original ReBeL paper was not performed?\n\n- Section 5: (2): adding a Gaussian noise -- was this described earlier in the paper? Why is this done?\n\n- Section 5: \"... we can retrain the PBS value network according to the action abstraction selected by the action network.\" and \"Theoretically, the PBS value network and action network can be repeatedly updated for training.\" Can you clarify whether these two sentences refer to the experiments in this paper, or to potential future experiments?\n\n- Algorithm 1: Are the hyperparameters set to 0 during test-time?\n\n- Algorithm 1 differs from ReBeL in that it samples an action at the root and then repeats (constructing the subgame, solving it, and then sampling an action), whereas ReBeL must play the strategy until the end of the subgame before constructing a new subgame. By re-performing search every iteration, the guaranteed convergence towards a Nash equilibrium strategy is lost. Was this considered when designing RL-CFR? Why not play the computed strategy until the end of the subgame like in ReBeL?\n\n- Algorithm 1: What depth do we solve to?\n\n- Section 6: Can you expand on the common knowledge in HUNL? What does it mean that they know each other's historical actions? As in the previous actions played during the hand? But that's always true. Why would we assume that the agents know each other's hand ranges?\n  - \"Hence, we can avoid actions that are not in the action abstraction.\" What does this mean? Whose action abstraction? Why can we avoid them?\n  - What does it mean that the agents know each other's hand ranges? Concretely, what does this mean in terms of the ReBeL and RL-CFR algorithms used? Does it mean that the PBS used by ReBeL and RL-CFR are set to be the actual PBS based on the action probabilities of the opponent on the previous action? If so, why do this? If so, how do the three references (Burch et al. 2018, Li et al. 2020, Kovarik and Lisy 2019) support this? If this is simply referring to AIVAT, then wouldn't it be more accurate to say that the *evaluator* knows both player's hand ranges, not that the *agent(s?)* know each other's hand ranges?\n\n- Section 6: \"Since the opponent may select actions that deviate from the game tree, we perform nested subgame solving...\" I don't see why this is the case in Slumbot vs. RL-CFR and not in ReBeL vs. RL-CFR. In the latter, couldn't ReBeL play some bet size that wasn't in RL-CFR's abstraction? Similarly, RL-CFR could play some bet-size that wasn't in ReBeL's abstraction, no?\n\n- Can you clarify MUL-ACTION and FINE-GRAIN? Why only set the action abstractions for the root? Why not for the whole subtree?\n\n- Appendix E: Algorithm 2: What is AAlimit?"
