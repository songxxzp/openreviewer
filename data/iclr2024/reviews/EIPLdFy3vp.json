The authors analyze time series data augmentation using an information theory perspective and introduce a new parametric augmentation method, named AutoTCL. This method adaptively creates augmentations for time series contrastive learning without relying on pre-defined knowledge. The proposed approach is encoder-independent, making it compatible with various backbone encoders. Experimental results indicate that AutoTCL outperforms leading baselines in both univariate and multivariate forecasting tasks, as well as in classification tasks."

In most cases, the performance is close to that of InfoTS, and further hyperparameter tuning of InfoTS is likely to bridge the performance gap. I see very limited utility of the proposed method.\n\nThere is no silver bullet, so what are the limitations of the proposed method?

It's ambiguous why h is able to focus on the informative part of the sequence. The author should provide several case studies to prove that h can indeed play a role in separating the information part and noise part of the time series. \n\n3. The two networks h and g use the same structure. How to ensure that they indeed perform the two different functions claimed by the author?\n\n4. How is \u0394v set in the experiments?\n\n5. The paper does not verify whether the positive view generated by the proposed method contains more information than the original sequence. Although the paper showcases the augmented instances through visualization in Figure 5, as the authors mentioned in the abstract, \"it is impractical to visually inspect the temporal structures in time series.\" Providing explanations for the generated positive samples based on Property 3 or other relevant data would be beneficial.\n\n6. From the visualization in Figure 5, it appears that the output mask of g is a binary mask, which does not match the description in the article. The article interprets g as a non-zero transformation mask. If the output of g is also a binary mask, does it mean that the optimal transformation method for sample enhancement that the model learns is simply to mask some observations of the original sequence?"

                "value": "The paper's weaknesses are:\n- Tables 6 and 7 along with the tables from the main paper seem to showcase marginal improvements over CoST, which was the architectural basis of their approach. In particular it is hard to determine if the difference is statistically significant.\n\n- Most of the comparison in table 6/7 is less relevant than the ablation study. The reason is the following: the authors are comparing different architectures. Most of these perform less well than CoST, and they are building on top of CoST. Hence these results are quite expected and should in my opinion not be presented first.\n\n- The authors propose a new augmentation scheme but focus only on CoST to showcase the performance of their approach. This means it is hard to determine whether their technique's benefits generalize to other settings.\n\n- Many of the comparisons hinge on the average of performance on other datasets. However I have some concerns about Lora values being strongly different from other approaches (my 3rd question in the next section). This and the unweighted average of results could bias the conclusions somewhat."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Could the authors please provide experimental results on the other usual datasets, Illness / Exchange rate / Traffic? \n\n- Could the authors please provide error bars/statistical tests for at least a subset of the experiments in tables 6/7? It is difficult to estimate whether the findings are statistically significant.\n\n- In table 4, Lora is the only dataset for which CoST results from prior tables diverge strongly from w/o Aug. We would expect those two results to be quite close. Could the authors expand upon that point?"
