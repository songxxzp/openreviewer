                "value": "This paper studies the influence on the number of parameters (over- vs. underparameterization) on the learned features. In particular, the work investigates whether a concatentation of independently trained underparameterized networks (with similar parameter count) retrieves the expressive power and performance of an overparameterized network. To scale networks, the work employs scaling of network widths, while keeping other network hyperparameters, such as depth, fixed (Sec. 2.1 & 2.3). To analyze feature similarity, they introduce some metrics: feature span error (Sec. 2.2), feature span gap (based on FSE; Sec. 3.2), and feature performance (Sec. 2.4). They find that underparameterized networks cannot fully capture the features of overparameterized networks, and vice versa (Sec. 3.2). Thus, they conclude that the networks seem to learn distinct features. Further, the features from the overparameterized have higher predictive prowess (Sec. 3.3). Finally, the work provides a toy example to show that some features can only be learned by overparameterized networks (Sec. 4)."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* The research question has significant flaws. That is, independently trained underparameterized networks are likely to converge to similar feature representations, as each of them tries to minimize the target loss and, thus, only the features with the largest effect on the target loss are learned (given the more restrictive capacity constraint from the width scaling). On the other hand, overparameterized networks do not suffer from such an issue and can use their larger capacity during training to learn more (and other) features to further reduce the target loss. Consequently, this raises substantial concerns about the empirical findings.\n\n* The paper is hard to follow. For example, the varying notation makes it hard to read without keeping track of notation and resolving ambiguities. E.g., why is $\\beta$ needed if $\\alpha$ suffices and seems to also be used interchangeably by the authors, e.g.:\n   * Eq. 2.1\n   * vs. \u201clinear combination of the features $\\lbrace m_{\\beta}(x_k)[s]\\rbrace^{\\beta n_L}_{s=1}$\u201d (p. 3)\n   * vs. $\\lbrace m_{\\beta}(x_k)[s]\\rbrace^{\\alpha n_L}_{s=1}$ (p. 4))?\n\n* Besides the above, the paper seems partially unordered. E.g., why are the proposed metrics interleaved with the setup on how the networks are scaled?\n\n* The introduced metric \u201cfeature performance\u201d is only a linear probe and not an original contribution of the work.\n\n* The feature residual analysis has contradictory results (Fig. 4a vs. 4b and Fig. 10). For the transformer setting, it is quite clear that the residual features help in predictive performance. However, for the ResNet setting this is not clear, as for $\\alpha=1/8$ and $\\alpha=1/16$ the difference is negligible. There is no discussion on this.\n\n* Sec. 4 seems to reiterate the lottery ticket hypothesis (the initial weights are particularly effective or ineffective for training). It is unclear how this relates to the empirical findings of the present work."

                "value": "* Do the authors ensure the same random initialization between the overparameterized and the underparameterized networks (assuming that layer widths are integer multiples of $\\alpha$)?\n\n* How do the underparameterized networks perform on the target task compared to the overparameterized network?\n\n* Seemingly, the underparameterized CIFAR-10 models improve their predictive performance for $\\alpha=1/2$ in Fig. 3. Is there any explanation by the authors for why?\n\n* How are the feature residual experiments conducted? I.e., how are these features \u201cappended\u201d? Is a new linear mapping $W^{(L+1)}$ learned for the additional features?\n\n* How is the MLP scaled in Sec. 4?\n\n## Suggestions\n\n* As mentioned above, the paper would be easier to follow by substantially improving the presentation. For example, instead of $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ in Def. 2.2, it would be easier if the authors would just use $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ instead.\n\n* Table 1 should be within the page size limits."

So that both networks are well-learned. Otherwise, the feature difference can come from well-learned / poorly-learned networks instead of overparameterized / underparameterized networks. \n- Table 1 and Table 2 tell me the feature difference actually comes from well-learned / poorly-learned networks.  Table 1 (b) shows the FSE feature difference starts to increase at $\\alpha=1/8$. meanwhile, table 2 shows the training accuracy starts to decrease at the same time ($\\alpha=1/8$). Please note that when $\\alpha < 1/8$,  Table 2 shows a very similar training accuracy (99.81 - 99.99) but different validation accuracy (92.72 -95.29). Table 1 ($\\alpha < 1/8$) doesn't reflect feature differences.\n- The proposed FSE score (Definition 2.2.) is a common metric. [1 (iclr)] shows (almost) the same feature score. [3] computes a linear regression between two sets of features. Canonical Correlation Analysis [2] also shares a close idea. \n\n- The feature concatenation of independently learned networks was tested in [3 (icml].

                "value": "5. Why use a linear layer to define the FSE? Why not allow yourself to use a nonlinear layer? Other works from the model stitching literature have done this, e.g. [Bansal et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07682). I would not be shocked if the main result from 3.2 didn\u2019t hold much for a nonlinear version of FSE.\n6 I see no error bars in some of the figures. Were these results based on one trial? Or are the error bars too small to see?"
