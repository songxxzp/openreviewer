However, I miss a little bit the relation to machine learning -- i.e. how exactly this might be applied to arbitrary machine learning systems. This is somehow mentioned in Appendix D, but I was wondering whether it might be beneficial, in order to make the paper more accessible to a larger community, to elaborate more on this in the main paper.\n\nMinor:\n- Broken reference in Section 2 second line?\n- Sometimes the authors write \"non-backtracking\" and sometimes \"nonbacktracking\" -- I am not a native speaker but the first one looks more correct to me\n- V-SCM Reference in A.2 on page 12 is broken?"

The new methodology modifies the standard nonbacktracking requirement in counterfactual reasoning. It permits alterations in variables that are causally prior to the target variables in a counterfactual scenario, but only when these changes are necessary to meet a \"naturalness\" criterion. To balance this flexibility, an optimization framework is introduced to minimize the extent of such backtracking. Through experiments, the paper demonstrates that this new approach is more effective in generating practical, realistic counterfactual explanations compared to the standard Pearlian method."

                "value": "The example cited in the introduction does not seem to differentiate between: (1) a reasonable approach to reasoning about an \"actual cause\" (an event that is a cause of the outcome in this specific case); and (2) what the authors refer to as \"constructive\" reasoning (identifying plausible alternative events that could have changed the outcome). These are different goals, and both are useful. The former would be useful to identify causal chains, while the second is useful to determine what, in that causal chain, would have been a reasonable point of intervention to change the outcome.  This doesn't invalidate the results of the paper, but it casts the results in a different light. The approach outlined in the paper is not a replacement for the existing theory, but instead is an elaboration of it to allow for a wider range of types of reasoning.\n\nIt seems doubtful that \"naturalness\" can be defined in a way that is unambiguous and will be universally agreed upon. The specific \"mechanisms\" of intervention are generally external to the SCM. That is, the *way that an intervention changes the model* can be represented in an SCM (e.g., an atomic intervention substitutes for the structural function of the variable intervened upon), but the *manner in which that intervention achieves that result* is not represented in the SCM. Thus, the SCM itself does not appear to contain the information necessary to decide \"naturalness\". For example, the event \"Tom is restrained from hitting Jerry\" may be unlikely (unnatural) in a bus, but it would be entirely natural in a car. Specifically, suppose that Tom and Jerry are riding in a car, Tom is sitting the in the back seat, and Jerry is in the front seat. Tom could strike Jerry in the event of a sudden stop, but he wouldn't if he was wearing a safety belt.  Yes, it is possible that \"Wearing a seat belt\" could be represented in the SCM, but not all such \"intervention variables\" would be. This is a larger issue about \"what SCMs are good for.\" They cannot represent everything, so what should we expect them to be able to reason about? The authors propose that \"naturalness\" is one of those things, but this increases the number of things that the variables in a given SCM should represent.\n\nThe paper would be improved by a more intuitive explanation of the simulation experiments and why they should provide readers with confidence that the approach outlined by the authors is valid and useful. It seems counter-intuitive that such a claim could be supported by simulation and the current text does little to explain the underlying logic.\n\nThe experiments in Section 5 seem more like demonstrations and less like useful tests that, if the proposed approach did not work well, would have shown that. That is, they are not particular severe tests of the proposed approach."
