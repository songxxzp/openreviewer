The main motivation is that while current rewiring techniques rely on \"arbitrary\" heuristics (improving spectral gap, connecting nodes in the 2-hop), it would be ideal to *learn* such a rewiring. Further, the work proposes a way to study the expressive power -- in terms of WL -- for such a process. The work is evaluated on synthetic and real-world benchmarks."

Is this the case? \n\n(Q2) Regarding (W1), would it be possible to show results for existing deterministic rewiring techniques?\n\n(Q3) Regarding (W2) and especially (Q1), it is not clear to me how the technique can reduce over-squashing if it is only able to remove edges. It would be important to clarify (Q1), and provide some theoretical evidence that it is indeed able to alleviate over-squashing. In general by removing edges, one is reducing the total effective resistance over the graph."

Specifically, PR-MPNN first uses a GNN to learn the priors over edges, and then it samples multiple adjacency matrices from the edge prior distributions using SIMPLE, a gradient estimator for k-subset sampling. The sampled adjacency matrices are combined with the original adjacency matrix to obtain the rewired graph, which is used in the downstream tasks. The paper also provides theoretical analysis to identify conditions under which the proposed method can outperform randomized approaches."

The difference between the proposed PR-MPNN and previous works is not explicitly discussed in the related work section. \n\n3. The theoretical results indicate that PR-MPNN  is more effective in probabilistically separating graphs than randomized approaches under certain conditions. But how does this help PR-MPNN address the over-squashing problem?\n\n4. In the introduction section, the paper states that PR-MPNNs make MPNNs less vulnerable to potential noise and missing information. However, there are no empirical or theoretical results to validate such statements. \n\n5. PR-MPNN use SIMPLE to sample adjacency matrices. It seems to be an important component of the proposed model and the paper should provide an introduction to the SIMPLE method to make the paper self-contained. \n\n6. I also have some concerns regarding the experiments: \n\n(1) In the \u201cBaseline and model configurations\u201d paragraph, the paper states that there are two ways to leverage the sampled adjacency matrices when using multiple priors. However, it is unclear which method is used in their experiments. \n\n(2) When answering Q2, why compare PR-MPNN with different baselines on different datasets? For example, the paper compares PR-MPNN with OSAN, GIN+POSENC, DropGNN on EXP, CSL and 4-CYCLES datasets respectively. Also, the statement \u201cConcerning Q2, on the 4-CYCLES dataset, our probabilistic rewiring method consistently outperforms DropGNN\u201d is inaccurate since PR-MPNN only achieve comparable performance with DropGNN in some cases. \n\n(3) The results in Table 1 are quite confusing. What evaluation metric is used in these results? Why is it that on some datasets, such as OGBG-MOLHIV, a higher metric indicates better performance, while on others, such as ZINC and ALCHEMY,  a lower value is preferable?\n\n(4) There are no ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed model. \n\n7. In the conclusion section, the paper states that PR-MPNN \u201cis competitive or superior to conventional  MPNN models and graph transformer architectures regarding predictive performance and computational efficiency\u201d. However, there is no comparison between PR-MPNN and baselines regarding the computational efficiency in the main text."
