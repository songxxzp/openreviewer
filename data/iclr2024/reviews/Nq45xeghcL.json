                "value": "The paper presents a novel approach to tackle the challenge of training reinforcement learning agents in real-world scenarios without relying on strong episode resetting mechanisms. The authors propose a method called Reset Free RL with Intelligently Switching Controller (RISC) that learns to switch between controllers intelligently. RISC addresses the crucial aspects of managing state bootstrapping during controller transitions and determining when to switch between controllers. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various challenging environments for reset-free RL, including sparse and dense reward tasks, though the authors suggest further exploration of new environments or enhanced difficulty levels. However, a limitation of RISC is its potential unsuitability for environments with irreversible states, where safety concerns may arise. Additionally, the paper acknowledges the absence of leveraging demonstrations for agent guidance, which could be an interesting direction for future research."

By recognizing the absence of an imposed episode time limit in this setting and considering the duration of controller trajectories as a parameter, the authors introduce a novel concept: dynamically learning when to switch controllers based on the agent's ability to achieve its current goal. This intelligent switching mechanism not only optimizes the agent's experience collection but also facilitates more efficient learning by focusing on unmastered states and goals. The proposed algorithm, Reset Free RL with Intelligently Switching Controller (RISC), is evaluated on a challenging benchmark of robot manipulation and navigation tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in various reset-free environments. This novel approach to controller switching has the potential to significantly enhance the effectiveness of reset-free reinforcement learning algorithms, addressing an important and previously unexplored aspect of the field."

Existing RL methods typically train two separate agents: one toward the goal and another toward the initial state, aiming to bring the agent back to the initial state for additional practice. This paper contends that intelligently switching between these two agents, particularly when the agent is competent, is crucial. Furthermore, the addition of bootstrapping for the last state before switching is shown to significantly enhance performance. The proposed method, referred to as RISC, outperforms state-of-the-art reset-free RL methods on four EARL tasks (a common reset-free RL benchmark) and a four-room navigation task."

Why didn't the authors use the critic from SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) instead of training a new one?\n\n4. In EARL paper, they claimed not using bootstrapping can break the long TD chain, in contrast, this paper suggests using bootstrap. Could authors also discuss these two different ideas?\n\n5. Bootstrapping for time-out non-terminal states should always be performed, do you have any intuitions on is it more important in the reset-free setting, since in episodic RL setting, people generally just ignore it? \n\n6. At the beginning of section 5.1, the paper discusses RC and RISC. Could you please elaborate more on RC and the difference between these two agents? Does RC also use bootstrapping? \n\n7. Analysis on Fig.3 (the last paragraph of section 5.1), you mentioned the RISC agent tends to visit areas where Q-values are low. But in the third/fourth column of Fig.3, it seems like the RC agent also tends to visit areas where Q-values are low? In the third column, the RISC agent actually gathers lots of data in the first room where Q-values are already quite high.\n\n8. There\u2019s a performance drop on sawyer peg tasks, do you have any intuitions on the decrease of performance?\n\n9. Which task do you perform ablation study on in Fig.6?\n\n10. You mentioned demo data is put into the replay buffer, do you oversample it? Will RISC perform the same without demo data?\n\n11. There's a recent work called IBC (Demonstration-free Autonomous Reinforcement Learning via Implicit and Bidirectional Curriculum) from ICML 2023. While it is relatively new, it may be worth discussing it in the related work section without the need for experimental comparisons."
