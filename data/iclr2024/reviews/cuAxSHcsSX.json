                "value": "This paper delves into the exploration of federated learning in the context of linear contextual bandits (LCBs) while incorporating the principles of differential privacy (DP). The proposed algorithmic framework encompasses several key components, including LinUCB exploration, a distributed variant of the tree-based mechanism, privacy amplification, and a fixed batch update approach. This comprehensive approach offers compelling solutions for addressing both silo-level local DP and shuffle DP concerns. Additionally, the authors have identified and rectified an error pertaining to the total injected privacy noise, as previously reported in Dubey & Pentland 2020, contributing to the advancement of this field."

The presentation of the findings is commendable, as it effectively illustrates the potential privacy vulnerabilities present in Dubey & Pentland 2020. Furthermore, it compellingly highlights the necessity of a more robust silo-level local DP setting. The comparison with related work is both thorough and detailed, contributing to a well-rounded understanding of the research landscape.\n\n2. The paper provides a comprehensive narrative that encompasses regret and communication guarantees under varying privacy constraints. Impressively, the authors extend these guarantees to a broader range of privacy parameters, demonstrating a thorough exploration of the subject matter. Moreover, the novel extension of the current amplification analysis to their specific case adds a valuable dimension to the research."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The paper, while containing valuable insights, may benefit from some improvements in terms of clarity and presentation. Firstly, the algorithmic design, which incorporates several components and explores various privacy settings, could be made more accessible by summarizing the results in a table format. This would provide readers with a quick and clear overview of corresponding regret, communication, and algorithmic elements across different settings. Additionally, in terms of organization, it might be helpful to reconsider the placement of the concluding remarks, which currently reside under the simulation results. Furthermore, there appears to be a spacing issue in the section discussing the tree-based mechanism, possibly resulting from the authors' use of the vspace command in LaTeX.\n\n2. While the paper offers valuable contributions, the novelty and inspiration of the problem itself could be further developed. The concept of silo-level Local Differential Privacy (LDP), while important and rigorous, may be considered relatively straightforward to formulate. Additionally, the solutions presented in the paper largely draw upon existing results and algorithmic designs, rather than introducing fundamentally new insights or modifications to established findings, which limits the potential of this paper."

It is quite remarkable, since that work is well cited, but the arguments of the authors seem convincing to me. \n\nIn addition to showing the errors with that work, this work further develops a variant of LinUCB that provides the required level of privacy, and computes the regret bound. Another variant is considered where shuffle DP is used, which enables regret equal to the regret achieved by the super node."

I would suggest the authors first justify both DP notions in federated contextual bandits (especially SDP), and then state their corresponding results.\n\n- Related to the first point, it would be nice to add some discussions on whether the $M^{1/4}$ gap from centralized performance can be closed; otherwise, the significance of the result is hard to measure.\n\n- In terms of the DP techniques, I understand that there are many different choices and this work adopts two certain ones. It would be nice to clarify whether the adopted ones are necessary or if there are other feasible choices.\n\n- The fixed batch size selection potentially can be improved. Although performing adaptive communication protocol is no longer feasible, it might still be a good choice to have the batch length exponentially growing (as in many low-switching bandit studies) instead of being a fixed one.\n\n- A recent work [R1] studies a different kind of DP notion in federated contextual bandits. It would be nice to include and discuss it.\n\n[R1] Huang et al. ICML 2023 \"Federated Linear Contextual Bandits with User-level Differential Privacy\"."
