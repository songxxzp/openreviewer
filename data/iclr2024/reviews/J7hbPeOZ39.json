                "value": "This paper considers the problem of joint pricing and (cardinality-constrained) assortment optimization with contextual information. Specifically, the value of an item of context $x$ and price $p$ is defined as $\\langle\\psi^\\star, x\\rangle - \\langle\\phi^\\star, x\\rangle\\cdot p$ where $\\phi^\\star$ and $\\psi^\\star$ are both $d$-dimensional unknown vectors to be learned. Assuming a known lower bound $L_0$ on the price sensitivity $\\langle\\phi^\\star,x\\rangle$, the authors first proposed an algorithm (Algorithm 2) achieving optimal $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d\\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantee for this problem. The algorithm contains two phases. In the first phase, the algorithm generally pick uniformly random sets and prices in order to guarantee lower bounded eigenvalue of the covariance matrix, guaranteeing good bound on the parameter estimation error. In the second phase, the algorithm applies UCB strategy on both the price and the assortment. The authors also provide $\\Omega(d\\sqrt{T}/L_0)$ regret lower bound for this problem, showing the optimality of their obtained upper bound. Finally, the authors also conducted numerical analysis on their proposed algorithm and showed empirical better performance compared with the ones of the previous algorithms."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- One main concern is the novelty in the analysis of the proposed algorithm. While this problem is proposed by the authors and is new, the algorithm design is very similar to the previous work in [Oh & Iyenger 2021]. Specifically, in both works, the algorithm has two phases with the first phase doing uniform exploration on the decision variables to ensure good conditioning on the covariance matrix and the second phase making the decisions based on UCB. While in this work, the decisions involve both the assortment and pricing, given the proposition proposed in [Wang 2013], this UCB step is also not hard to obtain. From the analysis perspective, the proof idea is also similar to [Oh & Iyenger 2021] by showing the consistency and normality of MLE and then the regret bound follows from the standard term decompositions, which in my opinion does not introduce much challenge in the analysis.\n\n- Another concern is about the tightness of the upper bound and the dependency on problem-dependent constants. Specifically, the lower bound has $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{L_0})$ dependence on the minimum price sensitivity but the dependency on $L_0$ is not explicitly written in the upper bound. With some check, I think $P=\\Theta(\\frac{1}{L_0})$ (according to Lemma 1), $\\kappa = \\Theta(\\exp(-\\frac{1}{L_0}))$ (according to Lemma 3), and $T_0=\\Theta(\\frac{1}{L_0^2} \\exp(\\frac{2}{L_0}))$ (according to equation (16)), leading to regret dependent on $\\Theta(PT_0)=\\Theta(\\frac{1}{L_0^3}\\exp^{\\frac{2}{L_0}})$. This constant can be much larger than the one shown in the lower bound.\n\n- Also the algorithm requires the knowledge of the minimum price sensitivity $L_0$, which is in general not known to the learner in practice."

Currently, it seems to me that as long as the uniform exploration phase is done, the remaining analysis follows smoothly from [Oh & Iyenger 2021] and [Wang 2013].\n\n- Can the authors discuss more about the tightness of either the lower bound or the upper bound on problem-dependent constant?\n\n- One question for the analysis: while I understand the general idea of the algorithm and the analysis, for Lemma 6, I wonder how is $|\\langle \\theta_t,\\tilde{x}_t\\rangle - \\langle\\theta^\\star, \\tilde{x}_t\\rangle|\\leq (1+p)g_t$ obtained? I suppose that this is due to $||\\hat{\\theta}_t-\\theta^\\star|| _{V_t} \\leq \\alpha_t$ but $||(x_t,-px_t)|| _{M}\\leq (1+p)||(x_t,x_t)|| _{M}$ does not hold in general for PSD matrix $M$.

The paper does not even state the assumption on  $kappa$ which commonly exists in almost all the existing literature on contextual MNL bandits (Chen et al., 2020; Oh & Iyengar, 2021; Perivier & Goyal, 2022).  I encourage the authors to state the required assumptions clearly in the main text. Rather, the paper shows such dependence on $kappa$ only in the appendix (in Lemma 3). This dependence should be discussed. Particularly, given that the improvement in its dependence in the recent literature such as Perivier & Goyal, 2022 has been already shown.\n\n- **No dependence on $K$ at all?** The previous results (Chen et al., 2020; Oh & Iyengar, 2021; Perivier & Goyal, 2022). have shown logarithmic dependence on $K$. Yet, this paper does not show any dependence on $K$ even logarithmically, which is questionable. How was this independence achieved?\n\n- Comparison with the most recent and related work, Perivier & Goyal (2022), is very limited. Perivier & Goyal (2022) also considered both assortment pricing and selection under the MNL choice model. Although Perivier & Goyal (2022) do not jointly address pricing and assortment selection as this paper did. Yet, there is no sufficient comparison with Perivier & Goyal (2022) both in theory and even in the simulation.\n\n- I believe that Proposition 2 is too obvious to the readers of the contextual MNL bandit literature. There is no need to state this in the limited space of the main text.\n\n- The authors assert that \"[they] are the first to address the problem of dynamic contextual assortment selection and pricing.\" However, there appears to be an existing work by Miao and Chao (link below) that addresses assortment pricing and selection jointly. Miao and Chao's work is in a non-contextual setting.
