The authors introduce technical novelties, such as the combination of meta-actions and random permutations, contributing to the originality of the research.\n\nThe paper is well-structured and clearly presents the problem formulation, algorithms, and theoretical analysis. The inclusion of tables and figures enhances the clarity of the presentation.\n\nIn summary, the research addresses a significant problem in the field of continuous adversarial DR-submodular optimization with numerous real-world applications. The proposed algorithms demonstrate practical relevance and significance, contributing to the development of efficient optimization techniques for DR-submodular functions."

However, the limited space allocated to the pseudocode has resulted in somewhat disorganized format. I would suggest that the authors consider using algorithm2e to reduce the space occupied by the pseudocode, thereby enhancing its readability. Just a friendly suggestion."

Notably, for every problem they consider in the non-monotone setting, they either provide the first algorithm with proven sub-linear $\\alpha$-regret bounds or they improve the already existing $\\alpha$-regret bounds. They also report obtaining the state-of-the-art sub-linear $\\alpha$-regret bounds among projection-free algorithms in the majority of the monotone settings they consider.
