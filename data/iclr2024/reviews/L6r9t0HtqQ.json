To extract the representations with explicit semantic structure and interpretable components, i.e., attributes, this work proposes a kernel-based attributes identifier, where the attributes are learned with parameterized feature extractors and then the effective attributes are selected by the proposed identifier. By feature selection, the learned representations have less redundant information compared with the considering the combination of all attributes. Experiments on standard DG datasets are conducted, where the proposed method outperforms other comparison methods."

                "value": "1. The discussion on related works is indeed insufficient. Basically, this method focuses on learning interpretable representations with explicitly decomposed components. However, there are works that also consider the decomposition or encoding of attributes from different perspectives, e.g., information bottleneck [r1] and rate reduction [r2].\n\n2. In the methodology part, only the kernel-based feature selection procedure is presented, while the justification and in-depth analysis are also necessary. Specifically, compared with other methods that also aim at learning attributes, what are the limitations in the existing methodology? Correspondingly, what are the advantages and weaknesses of the proposed method in learning components?\n\n3. In experiment validation, the proposed method achieves higher accuracies compared with other methods, while the comparison methods are generally proposed before 2021. To ensure a fair and appropriate comparison, the latest SOTA methods in DG are highly expected to be considered.\n\n4. Though it is natural to decompose the input into different attributes, the number of attributions $K$ seems to be a hyper-parameter and the learned $K$ attributes lack interpretability. In related works, e.g., [r1], some justifications and intuitions are provided for learned attributes.\n\n5. Since $K$ is a hyper-parameter, it is indeed necessary to provide theoretical analysis or reasonable explanation. In its current form, only experiment results with different parameter selection is provided, while the analysis is insufficient.\n\n\n[r1] Li, Bo, et al. \"Invariant information bottleneck for domain generalization.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

The main contributions are 1) an attribute-based representation for DG capturing semantic concepts, 2) a kernel learning approach for robust attribute identification across domains, and 3) achieving strong empirical results compared to prior DG methods. KEAI provides an innovative way to leverage source knowledge when generalizing to new target domains. Experiments validate its effectiveness for domain generalization over the listed baselines."
