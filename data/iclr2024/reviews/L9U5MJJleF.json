The bottleneck is encouraged to encode interpretable concepts using dense annotations.  Furthermore, it is paired with an unsupervised side-channel conveying information that is constrained to be orthogonal to the concepts in the bottleneck.  The resulting generative model, CBGMs, can be steered by controlling the concepts themselves and admits investigating its behavior by intervening on the concepts.  The experiments evaluate steerability, interpretability, debuggability, and generation performance against a selection of conditional generative models.\n\n**Post-rebuttal update**: I have increased my score based on the rebuttal."

                "value": "**Originality**: The idea of using concepts for steering generative models is by now somewhat familiar tho, as this is what VLMs implicitly do, and what conditional generative models have done for a while (the whole motivation for investigating disentanglement stems precisely from this problem, although I agree disentanglement does not guarantee interpretability).  The idea of integrating VAEs in concept-bottleneck classifiers has also been explored (as mentioned in the related work), but not for the purpose of steering generative models.\n\n**Quality**: The critical issue with this paper is that the experiments are lacking.\n\nFor instance, the experiment in Section 4.2 measures steerability only by turning concepts on (but not off).  It is not clear how to understand steerability:  it is defined as the accuracy of a pre-trained concept detector on generated images after turning on a concept that originally was predicted to be off.  Why the accuracy?  Why not the percentage of images in which the concept is predicted to be on?  What would be the ideal value, 100%?  If so, the numbers reported in the able are (better than the competitors but) quite far from this goal.  Also, the validation accuracy of the concept classifiers used to evaluate steerability is not reported, so how do we know they are high quality?\n\nUnless I missed something, interpretability is only assessed qualitatively (Section 4.3.1, Figure 4).\n\nGeneration quality (Section 4.4) is only measured for a single data set.  Same for debuggability in Section 4.3.\n\nOverall, the choice of research questions is okay, but taken individually the experiments leave something to be desired.  Evidence is provided for individual data sets or even selected examples.  This makes it difficult to assess the true limitations of CB-* models.\n\n**Significance**:  What is not entirely clear to me is what niche of problems CBGMs help with that VLMs cannot to some extent already deal with.  The other issue is that concept annotations -- as readily admitted by the authors -- is difficult to acquire.  This is why, recently, researchers have started defining concepts using VLMs like CLIP.  Mind you, I am not an LLM enthusiast -- but I feel there is something anachronistic about the proposed setup.  Still, I am a fan of concept bottleneck models and I like the idea of broadening their applicability.  The only serious issue is with the experimental evaluation."

I'd appreciate if you could clarify what motivated the limited choice of data sets, for instance.  Also, please let me know if I got it wrong and missed results that are in fact reported in the paper.\n\n**Score**: I graded the paper 3/10, but I think of it as a 4/10 (there is no such option in openreview).  I *am* willing to increase the score if solid motivations are provided for the interpretability, debuggability, and FID score of CB-* models on data sets besides those reported here, or any other solid indication that CB-* models hold their promises beyond the few data sets considered here."

In all method the encoded latent is fed to a set of \"concept networks\" - one for each conceptual property like colour, gender etc. - which are trained to project the latent on an embedding and predict the presence or absence (learned seperatly) of a specific context (with ground truth data provided as targets, i.e supervised). The generative model is trained in conjuction with the concept layers by using a linear combination of the concept embeddings weighted by their presence (or absence) probabilitliies. as input to the decoder (instead of the original latent). There is an additional orthogonality loss which constrains the concept embeddings to be orthogonal to an \"unknown\" concept embedding.\n\nControllability is achieved by constraining the presence or absence probabilities to a specific value and feeding the resulting combination to the generative process. Interpretability is achieved via inspecting the resulting presence / absence probablilites for different concepts.\n\nThe method is evaluated on several datasets with ground truth concept data and is shown to improve on baselines."

If I understand correctly these are the prediced concept presence probablilites after the model has been constrained to include them. This is problematic because a) we don't know the accuracy of presence classifier and b) measuring only the probablitiy doesn't tell us if the output actually contains the desired concept (i.e - there are no visualizations). \n* In absolute terms, the results in Table 1. are quite poor - I would expect much higher accuracies."

To address this, the paper propose to extend previous Concept Embedding Models (CEMs) to additionally encode an \"unknown\" concept that is meant to be orthogonal to any other concepts. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy on steering concepts compared to other conditional generative modeling approaches, and providing additional features such as interpretability and debugging of the individual models."

For example, the paper only explores simple GAN architectures not covering modern ones such as StyleGAN-2. I am also wondering why more recent methods such as GAN inversion could not be a baseline. If these point can be addressed, it will be also beneficial to support the model-agnostic aspect of the method. \n- More qualitative comparisons could be added and highlighted for the steerability experiments, given that the quantitative results are dependent on the pre-trained concept classifiers. \n- (minor) The definition of concept orthogonality loss, Eq (5), is written in somewhat confusing manner - e.g., the index j is not used in the definition."

One immediate ablation one can try is to check whether the loss is minimized is to strictly project the learned unknown context vector to be orthogonal to other vectors and see if there is degradation in performance. Or I think this kind of procedure can be even incorporated into the training phase to guarantee the minimal concept orthogonality loss.
