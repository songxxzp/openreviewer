                "value": "This paper raises a very interesting argument, that the weights within deep neural networks exhibit a similarity to the redundancy observed in human genes in that they both contain seemingly non-functional elements that play a critical role in their respective systems. This similarity is due to the fact that low-magnitude weights in pre-trained LLMs may appear \"useless\" for simple tasks and suitable for pruning, but they actually encode crucial knowledge necessary for solving more difficult downstream tasks."

                "value": "The main strength of this paper, compared to previous pruning works, is its task-centric viewpoint towards pre-trained weights. While it does not propose any new pruning way, the paper adopts a novel approach to isolate and quantify the significance of low-magnitude weights in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) by examining their correlation with the complexity of the downstream task for which the pre-trained LLM will be employed. This approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the role of small-magnitude weights in LLMs and their impact on performance, particularly for complex tasks.\n\nOne of the main highlights of this paper is the authors' proposal of a method to quantitative define NLP downstream task difficulty. While this is in general highly ambiguous, the authors proposed (1) Varying the Adequacy of Target Domain Data; (2) Majority v.s. Minority in Multi-Lingual Translation, which essential extends the first setting to multi-domain learning; (3) QA with v.s. without available external Information, and (4) for different task types, as the disparity in performance between humans and models, normalized by human performance. The definition will be broadly useful for understanding LLM (both full and compressed) performance in fine granularity."

                "value": "-\tThe fourth \u201ccross-task difficulty\u201d definition is flawed.  The authors assumed the larger the positive normalized performance gap between humans and models, the more difficult the task is for the model. However, if both human and LLM perform very poor (but \u201ccomparably poor\u201d) on one task, it could mean this task is very difficult, yet in your setting the \u201crelative\u201d gap might not be significant. Besides, as the authors also pointed out, different tasks might have different metrics so directly normalizing and comparing across tasks can be problematic too.\n-\tIt was known before difficult tasks are more fragile for pre-trained model pruning, such as in Sparsity-May-Cry (ICLR 2023). This paper essentially delves deeper on top of this exsiting observation."

This viewpoint is innovative and challenges conventional wisdom.\n\n2. The paper mainly employs magnitude-based pruning to identify and measure the subtle importance of low-magnitude weights. While this approach has been used in previous research, the paper introduces a more nuanced and task-specific application of this technique.\n\n3. The paper challenges the established beliefs regarding the role of \"Junk DNA\" in the human genome and its similarity to the redundancy observed in deep neural networks. By expanding the Junk DNA Hypothesis to encompass other criteria for weight importance, the paper offers a more comprehensive insight into the significance of low-magnitude weights in LLMs and their impact on performance."

However, it remains uncertain how the magnitude-based pruning approach would yield practical application value because (1) this vanilla pruning technique leads to a rapid decline in performance, and (2) unstructured sparsity is impractical for GPU implementation.\n\n2. Furthermore, the majority of experiments indicate that pruning performance, even for moderately challenging tasks, begins to drop at medium sparsity (around 30-50%). This raises doubts about the potential for any acceleration in LLM inference speed resulting from such pruning techniques."
