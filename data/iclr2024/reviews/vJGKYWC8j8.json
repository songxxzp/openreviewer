                "value": "In this paper, the authors focus on one specific traffic forecasting problem where the traffic information expands over time, and they aim to design a method that can simultaneously learn from the new data as well as the old data. Instead of training the model on the entire dataset once new data arrives, they adapt continual learning where the model can integrate the knowledge of the new data while not forgetting the past knowledge. Furthermore, they propose a set of modules to improve the performance of the model, such as clustering, VAE-based reconstruction, and forgetting-resilient sampling. The experiments on real-world datasets show the performance of the proposed method."

The Traffic Forecasting Mixture of Experts (TFMoE) method segments traffic flow into multiple homogeneous groups and assigns expert models to specific patterns, achieving superior performance and resilience in long-term streaming network datasets. \n2. The paper provides extensive experimental results on a real-world long-term streaming network dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of TFMoE. \n3.

The Structure of the paper could be improved - Section 4 seems to be a bit too long, while part of the experiments, especially the settings and principles have to be left in the appendix. As I am not an expert in this area, section 4 is a little hard to follow, many complex modules are introduced in this section which makes it easy to lose.\n2. As far as I know, clustering seems to be a common technique in the field of machine learning, while seldom reference is about the utilization of clustering in the traffic area. I think a discussion of clustering in this area is needed. Besides, the clustering operation seems to cost extra resources, in the sense of time or memory. Do the authors consider that?\n3. The paper does not discuss the generalizability of the proposed method to other traffic datasets, as there is only one dataset in the paper. I understand the hard of acquiring real-world data. Can we just use the real-world roadnet but generate several new traffic flows? In this way we can evaluate the methods on multiple datasets and see its generalization ability."
