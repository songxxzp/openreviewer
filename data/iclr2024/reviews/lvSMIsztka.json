The well-known Shapley value is a special case of the probabilistic value. Their estimator uses $O(n\\log n)$ evaluations of the utility function $U$, an improvement over the previous work [Kwon and Zou 2022] which uses $O(n^2\\log n)$ evaluations.\n\nTheir estimator is based on a simple observation: because $\\sum_{S\\subseteq [n]} p_{|S|}\\cdot U(S)=\\sum_{S\\subseteq [n]\\setminus\\{i\\}} p_{|S|}\\cdot U(S) + \\sum_{S\\subseteq [n]\\setminus\\{i\\}} p_{|S|+1}\\cdot U(S\\cup\\{i\\})$, we have $\\sum_{S\\subseteq [n]\\setminus\\{i\\}} p_{|S|}\\cdot (U(S\\cup \\{i\\})- U(S)) + \\sum_{S\\subseteq [n]} p_{|S|}\\cdot U(S) = \\sum_{S\\subseteq [n]\\setminus\\{i\\}} (p_{|S|}+p_{|S|+1})\\cdot U(S\\cup i)$.\n\nHence, their method uses random sampling to simultaneously estimate $v_i':=\\sum_{S\\subseteq [n]\\setminus\\{i\\}} (p_{|S|}+p_{|S|+1})\\cdot U(S\\cup i)$ for all $i\\in[n]$ and $\\sum_{S\\subseteq [n]} p_{|S|}\\cdot U(S)$, and then substracts the later from the former to get the estimates of $v_i$ for all data points $i\\in[n]$.\n\nThe advantage of their method is that a random sample $S\\subseteq [n]$ can be used to estimate $v_i'$ for all $i\\in S$ simultaneously, using just a single evaluation of the utility function -- $U(S)$. In comparison, if we use the sample $S$ to estimate the $v_i$ for all $i\\in S$ directly, we would need to evaluate $v(S\\setminus \\{i\\})$ for all $i\\in S$. Thus, they get an improvement from $O(n^2\\log n)$ evaluations to $O(n\\log n)$ evaluations."
