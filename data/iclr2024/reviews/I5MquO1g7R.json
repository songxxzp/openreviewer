                "value": "This paper tackles the problem of change point detection in the offline setting. While a large span of previous methods rely on Hidden Markov Models, the authors introduce TV-HMM, a variant of the Hidden Markov Model incorporating the time-varying location transition matrix. An EM-based algorithm is proposed for inference with theoretical guarantees. The TV-HMM model is shown to lead to more robust results compared to standard HMMs and is better suited when the number of change points is not known.\n\nAn extension of the TV-HMM model to a semi-parametric setting is proposed, getting rid of the usual restrictive distribution assumptions."

                "value": "I thank the authors for this nice submission. Some of my questions are already listed in the previous sections. My others questions/comments (including some typos) are presented below. \n\n- I appreciate the discussion on computational complexity at the end of Section 2.2. Nevertheless, I would have been interested to see in the paper a more detailed discussion about the computational complexity of the algorithm (in terms of time and space) compared to others approaches.\n\n- A closing parenthesis is missing at page 4 in the E-step equation. Same in the first line of Eq.(2). \n\n- In assumption A1, I think in the Gaussian distribution $S_k$ should be $\\Lambda_k$ (to be consistent with the notations used in Eq.(1)).\n\n- There is a typo in the use of the notation $M_{K+1}$. For example, in the first bullet point of Assumption A3, it should be $t_i\\in \\{1,\\dots, M_{k+1}-1\\}$. (Let me point out that $M_k$ for $k\\neq K+1$ have not been defined and I think that they should not be used anyway). The same holds for the second bullet point of assumption A3, Theorem 1, Figure 1 and Section C of the Appendix.\n\n- In Section 4, the use of the notation $\\theta_k$ is confusing. Indeed, before section 4, we work in the full parametric case and $\\theta_k=(u_k,\\Lambda_k)$ (the parameter of the Gaussian distribution from which points are independently sampled from after the $k$-th change point). However, $\\theta_k$ in Section 4 needs to be a vector in $\\mathbb R^D$ (i.e. in the same space as the observations). Therefore, it might be good to use another notation or to stress at the beginning of Section 4 the properties of $\\theta_k$.\n\n- In Eq.(4), the parameters $\\pi_{k,m,n}$ are still considered but the update from line 8 (Algo 1) is not presented anymore in Algo 2. I would be grateful if the authors could clarify this point.\n\n- Below Algorithm 2, there should not be a final point: \"Unlike Equation 2 in the parametric model, where $Q(\\theta)$ must be derived using variational inference. Here, $Q(\\theta)$ can be generally modeled using non-parametric density estimation...\". Furthermore, using \"must\" suggests that no alternative can be considered. However, I would say that standard MCMC techniques could be used instead of variational inference. If the authors agree, I would suggest to reformulate the sentence. In the second sentence, it is also mention that $Q$ can be modeled using non parametric techniques, but the following sentence (and the presented algorithm) only deal with a parametric distribution (with parameter $\\Phi$). It might be good to mention how the algorithm is changed when a non-parametric density estimation method is used. \n\n- To be consistent with the notations introduced in sections 2 and 3, should $K$ in Algorithm 2 be replaced by $\\tilde K$ (since $K$ is the true and unknown number of change points) ?\n\n- In Section 4, \"from MMD-based message passing of Equaton 4...\" : it should be \"Equation\"."
