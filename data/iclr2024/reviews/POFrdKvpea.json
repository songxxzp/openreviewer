                "value": "[Clarity]\n\n- In Sec.4.1, the paper uses a half page and two formulations to introduce view-dependent pruning. I think this part seems redundant. Because the following view-independent pruning is not based on the view-dependent pruning.\n\n- In Sec.4.2, the paper introduces $e = RAHT(p,f \\cdot I_l)$ as a straightforward implementation. I am not sure how to introduce the importance and then recover $f$. Actually, I think $f \\cdot I_l $ destroy $f$ and it is hard to recover $f$. It is not a noise issue. Instead, I think the proposed mask strategy is more intuitive. Also, if $e = RAHT(p,f \\cdot I_l)$ is important, it would be better to use it as a baseline. I think this part introduces more confusion.\n\n- I could not follow the first formula in Section 4.3, the independent variables are distributions p and q, but in the right of the equation, there is only q. I am not sure how to eliminate the distribution of p. Are any assumptions or references missing?\n\n- Fig.1 is too small, and it does not provide enough explanation. I cannot follow the meaning of the color or the connection between local patterns and latent features.\n\n- Fig.5 is hard to distinguish. All the results of different methods seem the same. It would be better to highlight their difference.\n\n[Fig.4] In Fig.4, the compressed model achieves a 100 $\\times$ compression ratio while obtaining a higher SSIM (top right). Would you please provide more discussion on it?\n\n[Speed & Practicality] In Sec.5.1 Encoding Time Comparison part, the paper claims that the proposed method only requires additional 1s for decoding. This part is vague. I am not sure whether this time has a huge impact or is insignificant during testing. The overall compression seems complex. I suggest the decoding time and the overall inference time should be discussed in detail. More specific settings, including batch size, image size, and overall inference time, are needed.\n\n[$|f_v|$] Eq.5 is not so convicting. For me, I think it is easy to understand that the minimum absolute value means low information. But I am not sure the maximum absolute value can be employed to quantify the amount of information. The paper claims this is based on''statistical measures''. It would be better to provide statistical evidence or some references to support this claim.\n\n[Task specific] The feature encoding and the entropy minimization seem like standard strategies for data compression and are not specifically designed for Nerf. It would be better to highlight the main contribution of those two parts regarding Nerf.\n\n\n[Experiments]\n\n- This paper claims that integrating pruning strategies into training pipeline is time-consuming and impractical for compression(Section 4.1). But it is still important to compare those existing methods(Deng & Tartaglione, 2023; Xie et al., 2023), even the proposed method is a post-optimization method.\n\n- The comparison experiments are insufficient. I suggest to compare previous works like (Li et al.,2023; Rho et al., 2023;)\n\n[Typo]\n- Section 1, propsoe -> propose\n- Appendix Section C, subscript error\n-The description of baselines should be more specific (Fig. 5), like the definitions of \"ACRF(DVGO)\" and \"ACRF-F(DVGO)\"."
