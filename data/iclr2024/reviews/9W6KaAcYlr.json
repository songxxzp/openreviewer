For instance, for ON-OFF RGCs that respond to both light increments and decrements, optimizing a single, short MDS to maximize their response may not adequately capture their unique properties. Similarly, for cell types like \"OFF suppressed 2,\" which exhibit a high baseline firing rate mostly suppressed by stimulation, the algorithm may not effectively identify them without specific adaptations, potentially requiring additional stimulus optimization strategies for better classification.\n\nThe absence of a benchmark is a significant weakness in this paper. It would be helpful if the author can add any performance to determine its effectiveness or limitations."

They referenced figure 2B when stating in the text that \u201cnone of the MDS exhibited direction selectivity\u201d, but I didn\u2019t quite understand why Figure 2B is referenced here.\n3. For the experiments in Figure 2, the identified MDS seems to be largely combination of several functional cell types from the published Baden et al (2016) paper. I wonder if further tweaking with the sub-clustering procedure can better recover the published functional cell types.\n4. How will the result change if the number of gradient ascent steps is changed during each M-step? Trying to understand if there is a delicate balance needed between how well the M-step is optimized and the E-step, or if the procedure is relatively robust and almost guaranteed to converge to the same set of results."
