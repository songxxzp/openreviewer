                "value": "The main review, with comments and questions, are all in this section owing to the flow in which this review was conducted.\n\n### Abstract\n\n- I think there is some ambiguity w.r.t. the first sentence: the DAG can be known but the relationships (the mechanisms) of the DAG unknown, or vice versa. Which one do you mean? In the original paper (Aglietti et al) the DAG was always assumed known but there are other settings where the DAG is assumed unknown.\n- Good abstract. Perhaps a bit more information on the experiments you performed (just the one sentence ought to do it).\n\n### Introduction\n\n- The supply example is great, but the way you introduce it in the second paragraph, reads a bit forced. Consider rephrasing. It doesn't sound very good at the moment.\n- If you are modelling a phenomena in an environment that is changing, why is it not possible to model that with a temporal DAG? Or dynamical DAG? There is plenty of that type of work being done. \n- Fig 1c - I am confused. Your blue nodes sound very much like standard non-manipulative variables and the idea of non-manipulative variables in causal setting, was introduced a long time ago. How are your blue nodes different?\n\n### Background and problem statement\n\n- There is some confusion here. In the abstract you said that $\\mathcal{G}$ was unknown and now at the start of paragraph one you say that $\\mathcal{G}$ is in fact know. Which is it?\n- Is there a reason you deviate from the standard SCM definition from Pearl with $\\langle U,V,P,F \\rangle$? It seems unnecessary to introduce new notation for a setting which is well defined and well studied. You are just saying, in different words and notation, the interaction between the endogenous and exogenous variables in the SEM. More confusingly though you say that the $\\mathcal{G}$ is part of your SCM definition whereas in the standard setting (well, Pearl's setting) the causal diagram is induced by the SCM, not part of it. See chapter 3 (Pearl, 2009).\n- What is the reasoning behind using soft rather than hard interventions? What would happen if you used hard instead?\n- There are as many actions as there are nodes $m$ in the graph? But then you are also intervening on the reward variable which is non-manipulative?\n- To check my understanding: actions are continuous, but there are a finite amount of continuous actions, the cardinality of the domain of each action is then $K$? Why isn't each action just continuous?\n- I think you should rephrase the uncertain parts of your problem statement: it is not the case that the causal model is unknown (this typically means the graph) but rather that the mechanisms of the SCM are unknown. You are not being precise enough at the moment to ward off ambiguity. Please change.\n\n### Method\n\n- I think this very important part deserves a deeper treatment, you say \"Contrary to standard CBO (where algorithms can choose actions deterministically), in adversarial environments such as ACBO randomization is necessary to achieve no-regret\" - why is that the case? Are you then saying that if you are using deterministic action selection it would be impossible to attain no-regret?\n- Consider using left-pointing arrows in algorithm 2 to make it more procedural, in place of using equality signs on line 4 and 5. That goes in general for all your algorithms.\n- How many times do you have to initialise the neural networks in algorithm 2 for this to work?\n\n### Analysis\n\n- It would be helpful if you gave an example of a Lipschitz continuous kernel, for uninitiated reader. I would also like to know what the consequence would be if you did not make this continuity assumption and how realistic it is?\n\n### Computational considerations in larger action spaces\n\n- Can you please comment on this line: \"even with a large number of action variables $m$, $|\\mathcal{A}|$ may still be small and thus CBO-MW feasible to implement\" - what is 'large' here? When does it become unfeasible? Some numerical ballpark figures would be helpful. \n\n### Experiments\n\n- To confirm: you are considering the causally sufficient setting i.e. you assume there are no unobserved confounders? If so, please state that early on in the paper (apologies if I missed it).\n- Would it also make sense to also compare against CBO? Don't worry this review is not conditional upon you doing that, I am merely wondering why it is not part of your analysis, seeing as you talk about it early on.\n- The SMS example is _great_. Really enjoyed reading that."

The paper claims to show a generalization of CBO, which it seems to be an * algorithm * proposed in Aglietti et al 2020 as a solution to the \"Causal Global Optimization\" (CGO) problem. Here, in the abstract but also in the main paper, (1) no mention to the CGO problem is made (2) CBO seems to refer to the \"setting\" (somehow as a replacement to CGO), while the algorithm proposed here is CBO-MW. But CBO is not a setting, as said, it's an algorithm to solve the CGO under certain assumptions. In CBO, there are intervention *sets* and intervention *values/levels* (continuous-valued). I cannot see any of these here throughout, so it's unclear whether interventions on multiple variables here are excluded or what. In general, are you trying to also solve the CGO problem (a suitably modified version under external interventions, of course) or not ? Again on this point, the authors claim to compare using \"previous CBO benchmarks\", but there are no benchmarks actually from the CBO paper of Aglietti et al 2020, and the CBO-CW is actually *not* compared (nor experimentally, nor methodologically with a discussion) to CBO itself. There is also no \"causal prior\" associated to the GP as in CBO. \n- My understanding then from the above is that this work is actually not an extension of CBO at all (although I would like to hear from the authors), rather an extension of GP-MW which is mentioned a lot and compared to experimentally. \n- Strengthening my belief wrt to the \"distance\" of this work with CBO, the authors here evaluate performance with the **cumulative** regret. This does not seem to be used at all in CBO, where instead a simple regret seems to be used (Aglietti et al 2020)."
