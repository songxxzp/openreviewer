The following method is highly similar with CSI, an existing method. To offer a clearer perspective, the authors should provide a detailed comparison with CSI, highlighting the key distinctions between these two approaches. Does the contribution come from the proposed augmentation?\n2.\tThe concept presented in this paper has been explored extensively in the literature. Many previous works have investigated the use of fine-grained or natural synthetic anomalies as alternatives to basic augmentations to enhance performance. For instance, in [a], the method incorporates Poisson image editing to seamlessly blend scaled patches of various sizes from separate images. It would be valuable to investigate how such Poisson image editing performs within the CSI framework and whether the proposed diffusion model-based augmentation outperforms these methods when applied within the same CSI framework.\n3.\tThis paper seems to be incomplete or abbreviated. For instance, in Figure 4 on Page 8, two non-medical datasets, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, are employed, yet these datasets are not introduced or explained elsewhere in the paper. Additionally, the results are not compared with any baseline methods, such as CSI. \n\n[a] Schluter et al. \"Natural Synthetic Anomalies for Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection and Localization.\" ECCV 2022."
