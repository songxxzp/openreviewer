The ultimate goal is to makes a multi relation graphs for few-shot learning. They used conventional and well-known variational inferences, also shows the success in the skin-cancer datasets in the prediction accuracy and interpretation in some sense. Overall, the contribution is incremental, and experiments are limited to skin-cancer datasets. Obviously, the proposed algorithm can have advantages in a few shot and imbalanced datasets cooperated with Bayesian approaches."

The use of multi view graphs can be attractive approach such as the idea of many filters or multi-heads. The interpretabilty plays an important role to validate the proposed algorithm. Experiments follows the standard routine in machine learning, compared to base-line algorithms. Baes-line algorithms seem appropriate in the scope of distance-based few-shot learning. The algorithm provides gains in the performance and interpretability."

More generalization and advantages are widely explored in the various fields, and if possible, the conventional algorithms for few-show learning can be added to baseline algorithms (cannot be fair, but it can provide some implications). The presentation is not kind for the reader, especially not familiar with few-shot learning and mathematical formulation of variation inference (maybe there are many omissions in the math expression)."
