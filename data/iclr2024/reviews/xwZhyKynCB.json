            "questions": {
                "value": "(1) The presentation of the paper needs to be improved. In particular,\nsome definitions need to be clarified.\n\n- Definition 4: Consider the formula $P(x) \\wedge \\exists x R(x,y)$. In\n  this case, both $x$ and $y$ are free variables, although only $y$ is\n  considered free according to the definition in the paper. This may\n  seem like a minor point, but the correct definition of this notion\n  is necessary when considering a logic with a bounded number of\n  variables, which is a standard way to construct fragments of\n  first-order logic with tractable query evaluation.\n\n- Paragraph after Definition 9: The authors claim the following:\n  \"... the inference of existential formulas is easier than solving\n  CSP instances since the existential variables do not need to be kept\n  track of\". I do not understand this claim, as the complexity of CSP\n  solving and conjunctive query evaluation is the same (both problems\n  are NP-complete).\n\n- Definition 7: What does it mean that \"$\\phi(a_1, ..., a_k)$ is True\"?\n  Where is this query evaluated? Do you assume a fixed knowledge graph\n  over which all queries are evaluated?\n\n- Definition 7: How is the semantics of negation defined under OWA? Do\n  you consider a certain answer semantics over some possible worlds\n  (otherwise no negative atoms can be inferred)? The authors use the\n  term \"$\\phi(a_1, ..., a_k)$ is True\" without defining it.\n\n- Definition 12: For an abstract query graph G, a grounding is a\n  function I that maps G into a query graph. Do you impose any\n  restrictions on this mapping? For example, could two distinct nodes\n  with the type \"Free variable\" be mapped to the same variable? This\n  is relevant for the bottom-left graph in Figure 2, which is claimed\n  to violate Assumption 14 (this is not true if you can map both\n  yellow nodes to the same variable).\n\n- Paragraph after Assumption 15: The authors mention the following\n  \"Assumption 15 treats negation separately because of the fact that\n  for any KG, any relation r in R, there is |{ (h,t) | h,t in E,\n  (h,r,t) in KG}| << E^2\". I do not understand this notation. On the\n  left-hand side of <<, you count a number of tuples, while on the\n  right-hand side, you are considering the cross product of a set with\n  itself. Isn't this a comparison of a number with a set?\n\n\n(2) The treatment of parameters upon which the difficulty of\nconjunctive query evaluation depends is somewhat superficial. In fact,\nthe authors have made a contribution by lifting the restriction that\nconjunctive queries must be tree-shaped and by considering an approach\nto generate general graph-shaped queries. However, between trees and\ngeneral graphs, there exists a large number of structures that are\ndefined in terms of parameters which have been studied precisely to\nanalyze the complexity of query evaluation. Most notably, the authors\ncould have considered the notions of treewidth and hypertree width,\nwhich are explained in the following references:\n\nJ\u00f6rg Flum, Martin Grohe: Parameterized Complexity Theory. Texts in\nTheoretical Computer Science. An EATCS Series, Springer 2006.\n\nGeorg Gottlob, Gianluigi Greco, Nicola Leone, Francesco Scarcello:\nHypertree Decompositions: Questions and Answers. PODS 2016: 57-74\n\nMoreover, the following book provides a detailed view of fast\nconjunctive query evaluation:\n\nhttps://github.com/pdm-book/community\n\n\n(3) Why do you need to develop your own algorithm to compute the\nanswers to an existential formula, as described in Section 4.3? Why\ncan't you leverage the substantial body of work and existing\nimplementations for answering first-order queries?"

Dataset of query graphs with Answer Sets built from Query graph sampling - It is not validated whether these produce meaningful query graphs when grounded to real-concepts, and how representative is this dataset for Complex QA on a KG with natural questions.\n\n2. There seem to be several key limitations - How does this help with improving Complex questions answering of natural question datasets e.g. WebQSP, Complex WebQSP. First, the approach here does not examine how natural questions from such datasets can be formulated into query graphs with any automatic methods (that are not manual, which would be critical to use this approach). Secondly, it does not suggest how the dataset can improve results on standard QA datasets like Complex WebQSP or the likes for KGQA.\n\n3. I am not clear about how the learning-based methods are relevant here. The dataset is formed by solving some version of CSP (details lacking entirely of their \"own algorithm\" in Sec 4.3), and then what is the relevance of learning based methods to embed the query graph and try to infer the answer? And this still does not connect to the complex natural question KGQA methods to produce answers for natural questions from the KG.  \n- Section 4.3 \"we develop our own algorithm following the standard solving technique of CSP, which ensures\nconsistency conditions in the first step, and do the backtracking to get the final answers in the\nsecond step\".\n\n4. Approach presentation and clarity - The whole Framework section (4.1-4.4) in the main paper is limited, and does not at all deliver what the approach is (and even if we read through the Appendix, its not presented well enough to grasp the key points of the approach at high-level but with sufficient detail). The presentation is poor with unnecessary assumptions and elaborations (unrelated to the proposed contributions) listed in the main paper, and much of the methodology in the Appendix.\n\n5. This paper is derivative \n- It extends to only 2 free variables in practice (and the extension to multiple free variables, over their prior work Yin et al 2023 seems trivial?). \n- The two assumptions they define are extraneous as they themselves suggest this cannot be checked in practice (so the contribution claim that \"Our assumption is more systematic than previous ones as shown by the example in Figure 2.\" is not useful. \n- We include the whole family of EFO1 query, many of them can not be represented by operator tree. This is based on prior work directly, so its not a contribution of this paper. In which case the only contribution seems to be the dataset with 2 free variables and the heuristics extended to sample and ground the query graphs and get its Answer set for the dataset. The usefulness and solidity of the dataset is unexplored to be clearly justifiable as useful.\n- The heuristics to sample and ground the dataset are not obvious, clear, or validated, or effectively presented."
