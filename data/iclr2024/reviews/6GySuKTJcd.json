                "value": "This paper considers the problem of computing entropic optimal transport barycenters from continuous distributions. It is assumed that the authors only observe these continuous distributions from samples. The approach involves studying the dual of the entropic OT problem and using neural networks to approximate dual potentials. The barycenter can then be recovered from these potentials using the primal-dual relationship. With this new formulation, the authors can compute barycenters for general costs, which allows for the computation of barycenters under learned geometry (via StyleGAN). The method is also scalable to larger datasets than existing methods."

They also give a universal approximation result that states that there exist neural networks that can achieve this bound. The proof of duality and quality of dual potentials is essential.\n- Because the method works with general costs, it can work with manifold constraints, which gives some nice results in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. This is perhaps the most significant contribution of the work."

                "value": "My concerns mostly center around 1) the impact this work can have and 2) how many new ideas it contributes to the literature. While the extension to general costs is interesting, it seems somewhat straightforward, and I don't see how the methods developed themselves are necessarily tailored to the general cost nature of the problem.\n\n- The theorems all seem to have standard proofs that are straightforward extensions of existing results. I am not sure that the theory proposed gives any new techniques or insights. Furthermore, more important proofs are missing, such as how efficiently one can sample from the barycenter. Furthermore, the finite sample learning guarantees are nice to see but have no practical impact since there are no cases where they could estimate these errors in any practical example.\n- The method learns OT plans but not maps. This is true of the general entropically regularized setting. However, this adds complexity to the usefulness of the method because one doesn\u2019t have access direction to the barycenter distribution itself and rather only has conditional access through the reference measures.\n- In Figure 3, the method proposed doesn\u2019t recover the image content due to its conditional nature, despite the fact that their FID is lower. Is there any way of getting samples closer to the truth? Also, I guess the FID is lower than other existing methods because of the addition of the StyleGAN.\n- The samples, even in the manifold-constrained case in Figure 5.2, are comparable to SCWB, and therefore it is hard to see why the proposed method is better. This experiment is qualitative but not quantitative.\n- The authors acknowledge this, but it is difficult to compare with the true entropic optimal transport barycenter quantitatively. However, it would have been nice to see it in cases where it is known (for example, with Gaussians)."

If the input distributions $\\mathbb{P}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbb{P}_K$ are not probability distributions and do not share the same mass, would we be able to extend the enery-guided approach to approximate the barycenter of those distributions?\n\n4. If we replace the MCMC algorithm with other sampling methods, namely importance sampling, would the running time be improved? If not, what sampling methods are possible to achieve an improved running time. The authors should discuss more about this in Section 6.\n\n5.
