This approach aims to reduce forecasting errors compared to traditional methods not based on the solution manifold, further supported by numerical examples."

                "value": "1. I find the paper presents an overly simple idea with an unrealistic assumption. When the space of parameters $\\Theta$, the space for the inputs $\\mathcal{U}$ are both finite-dimensional, finding the unknown dynamics is, of course, a finite-dimensional problem. However, most of the time,  the space of parameters $\\Theta$/the input space $\\mathcal{U}$ are not finite-dimensional. This is why forecasting dynamics is hard. For example, suppose the initial condition is not known exactly but on an open interval, which is no longer finite-dimensional. In that case, we do not know what type of chaotic behavior will occur in the long-time horizon. The same thing applies to the parameter space. General variable coefficients, even for the smoothest functions in $C^\\infty$, are in an infinite-dimensional space before further assumptions.\n\n2. Even if we settle for finite-dimensional spaces for the initial condition, the parameters, the inputs, etc. (i.e., all the places where one can change the dynamics), the overall dimension can be large. Indeed, $C_{f,I}$ is the range of the forward problem, containing all possible trajectories. It is not possible to characterize the space analytically, so it will have to be done through the finite number of parameters mentioned above. In that sense, (13) becomes the standard parameterized minimization problem, like those we see in regressions. If we know a priori that the dynamics are only subject to a finite number of parameters, no one will use (12), which does not utilize this prior/expert knowledge.\n\n3. The numerical examples are simple, and the white noise assumption for the data, as shown in (17), is also too simple. The proposed method will perform poorly if the noise can be fit into the trajectory manifold $C_{f,I}$.\n\n4. The paper titled \"**Provably accurate** ODE forecasting through explicit trajectory optimization\". I don't see where the \"provably accurate\" is based. Both Theorem 1 and Proposition 1 are results with little to do with ODE forecasting. Theorem 1 is a consequence of the \"finite dimension\" assumption, and Proposition 1 is a property from differential manifold."

It was $\\hat{x}$ in (13), but became $\\tilde{x}$ in (16)?\n\n4. Figure 2 is a bit confusing. For some, we need to look for the maximum, while for some, we need to look for the minimum. It is better that they are all for maximum or all for minimum. Otherwise, it is confusing and hard to compare across different figures."

On the other hand, existing literature on the ML MAP and MMSE estimation of the initial conditions of a known ODE is not properly reviewed, and the novelty of the considered methodology lacks perspective. \n\n3) __Experimental aspect.__ One toy ODE model is by far bellow ICLR standard.
