                "value": "1. In Eq.(5), what is the MVR term? Could the author explain this in detail? Its first part is a sum of $J_i$-step updates, while its second part is a sum of $j$-step updates. I know these two parts come from the additional term from $\\theta_{i,j}^t-\\theta_i^{t-\\tau_i}$ to $\\theta^{t-1}-\\theta^{t-\\tau_i-1}$, but how does it perform as a variance reduction? The $u$ term is the update performed in each local iteration, so the MVR term is the difference between $j$ local updates and $J_i$ local updates where $j\\neq J_i$. Please provide the equivalent form in [1] and demonstrate its variance reduction efficiency in the main text.\n\n   [1]: Momentum-based variance reduction in non-convex sgd\n\n2. The authors claim that they propose the GHB form in Table 1. However, the same updates have been studied in [2] which adopts a multi-step momentum. By setting the specific coefficients as some fixed constants, [2] performs the same updates as the global GHB. Actually, the claimed global GHB in this paper is only a special case of [2]. It also provides some convergence analysis to understand more complicated cases. Therefore, the contribution of this paper seems to only extend the global GHB to the local GHB without any analysis of optimization or generalization, which greatly reduces the novelty of this paper.\n\n    [2]: Enhance local consistency in federated learning: A multi-step inertial momentum approach\n\n3. In the experiments, it indicates that the non-iid dataset split adopts a $\\alpha\\rightarrow 0$. While in the appendix, it shows $\\alpha=0$. Please unify this statement.\n\n4. The results are incomplete. For instance, in Table.2, 3, 4, there are no results of FedCM and FedADC. However, in Figure.3, the curves of FedCM are stated as an ablation study. As the very important baselines of this paper, the comparison with FedCM and FedADC is very necessary, which are also two SOTA methods among the momentum-based methods. Authors should add their performance tests to this paper.\n\n5. The experiments do not adopt the learning rate decay. On page 15 in the appendix, the authors claim that all experiments do not use a learning rate scheduler for simplicity. However, this will significantly reduce the performance of some algorithms and make comparisons unfair. For instance, the ADMM-based method, i.e. FedDyn, requires to be optimized well enough on the local client. Otherwise, dual variables will be updated with very large biases. A similar phenomenon also happens in SCAFFOLD and even FedCM. I think this is the main weakness of the experiment in this paper. All results only reflect the phenomenon under a fixed learning rate. While in the current machine learning, the learning rate decay in non-convex optimization is very important and one of the major concerns. Although changing the learning rate complicates comparisons, this kind of comprehensive study can broadly reflect the performance of the proposed method."
