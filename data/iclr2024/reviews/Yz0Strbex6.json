According to this standpoint, I have wrote following comments.\n\n1. The paper is well-written (presentation is good).\n2. Propositions and Theorems are correct.\n3. Feature selection techniques may be a good option to improve regression based on signature transformations. This is because users will want to use somewhat large $K$ since an appropriate value of $K$ is not known in advance, but in that case the number $\\frac{d^{K+1}-1}{d-1}$ of predictors becomes large (when $d\\neq 1$).\n4.

                "value": "6. I have thought that the sentence \u201cGiven the successful application \u2026 time series data\u201d expresses the motivation for this study. However, this motivation is too abstract. I would like to see a concrete description as to why discussion to support claim 1 is demanded.\n7. Most of the related studies seem to be published by the same research group. I am concerned about this point. For example, all the application paper cited in Section 1 (except for the arXiv paper (Arribas, 2018)) were published by the same research group. I cannot know if unrelated researchers recognize the usefulness of signature-based techniques in their applications. Please tell me about some interesting applications that unrelated researchers have done. Also, I think that the authors should cite such papers as well. I think that this is needed for an ICLR paper. This comment has nothing to do with whether the authors of this paper belong to that research group.\n8. In recent years, \u201cseries-to-point non-linear (neural-network-based) regression\u201d, which is an end-to-end regression in the setting of this paper, has been well studied. For example, studies referred in Section 3.3 of \u201cAhmed, S., Nielsen, I. E., Tripathi, A., Siddiqui, S., Ramachandran, R. P., & Rasool, G. (2023). Transformers in time-series analysis: A tutorial. Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing, 42(12), 7433-7466\u201d. Is there a practical advantage to doing \u201cpoint-to-point linear regression via signature transformation\u201d? (I may have missed a cited paper that makes such a comparison. I'm sorry if that's the case. Please tell me that paper.) Considering readers of ICLR, it is worth mentioning the comparison between such techniques and signature-based ones. Also, the input dimension $\\frac{d^{K+1}-1}{d-1}$ of \u201cpoint-to-point linear regression via signature transformation\u201d can be larger than the input dimension $d T$ of \u201cend-to-end regression\u201d. Is this a negative factor of \u201cpoint-to-point linear regression via signature transformation\u201d?\n9. I would like to ask for additional explanation of interpretations of signature $ S(\\mathbf{X}\\_n)\\_T^{i\\_1,\\ldots,i\\_k}$ for each combination of $i\\_1,\\ldots,i\\_k$. There are generally two main types of evaluation strategies of Lasso: regression error or parameter estimate error. This research focuses on the latter, which means emphasizing the interpretability of the parameter estimate itself. For that position, the interpretability of signatures should be important.\n10. I could not understand the meaning of the experimental comparisons for Figures 1 and 2 to support claim1. When integral methods are different, the generated data (in particular, $\\\\{y\\_n\\\\}$) are different, and data analysis methods (the sets of features used for Lasso regression) are also different. For example, for data analysis in real situation, only one data is given, so analysis with different generated data is useless. In particular, since the comparison uses different data, I think that there is a gap between the experimental results and claim 1. Contrary, if the authors want to focus their discussion on the influence of the integral method on the distribution properties of the signature, it would be natural to consider with a single data analysis method. Please tell me more specifically what the authors want to claim with the experimental comparisons for Figures 1 and 2, and in what situations that claim is useful.\n11. Another problem is that consideration and explanation of reasons for the experimental results are not sufficiently described. (I imagine that multicollinearity among the explanatory variables $ S(\\mathbf{X})\\_T^{\\ldots}$ influences the experimental results; is it right?)\n12. Regarding \u201cOther feature selection techniques\u201d in Section 5. The ridge regression is not used for feature selection typically. Rather, it will be better to cite, for example, bridge regression (Frank, I. E., and Friedman, J. H. (1993), \u201cA Statistical View of Some Chemometrics Regression Tools,\u201d Technometrics, 35, 109\u2013135).\n13. $\\\\{\\epsilon\\_n\\\\}\\_n$ in (3) requires 0-mean assumption at least (otherwise $\\tilde{\\beta}\\_0$ will be biased)."

Signature transforms are known for their ability to linearize the problem of feature selection. \n\nThe main contribution of the paper is the exploration of the correlations of these transforms when applied to Brownian motions and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. This is done for signatures defined by Ito and Stratonovich integrals. They achieve this by analyzing the signatures' definitions in the context of different stochastic integrals and directly manipulating the resulting expressions. Then, using the Irrepresentable Condition (which, as proved in [Zhao & Yu '06], is almost equivalent to sign consistency of the Lasso estimator), study the consistency of the Lasso estimator when applied to the inference of labels generated from the signature transforms of these stochastic processes.\n\nThese results are then contrasted with numerical simulations that compare the performance of this signature-based regression under both Ito and Stratonovich integral definitions. Their findings suggest concrete settings under which signature transforms defined over one or the other integral definitions should be preferable."

The references listed do not seem to be enough to support this. Furthermore, in the introduction it is claimed that, on several important Machine Learning problems, this methodology yields state-of-the-art results. But many of the references provided to support this are rather old for the standards of the field. Thus, it is not clear that this is indeed the case. All lead me to think that, although the paper has clear merits, it could maybe be a better fit for a more specialized venue than ICLR. However, if the authors could provide further references to change this opinion, I would be willing to upgrade my evaluation.\n\n- The second one being that consistency does not appear to be the most relevant performance metric for this kind of problems. First because it only describes the large sample limit of the estimator and does not give insights about its performance for, the usually more realistic, finite sample scenarios. But also because, as discussed by the authors themselves, this measure can be too restrictive. It is true that the authors go on to explore other performance metrics in the appendices; but they do so only in a numerical way. Finally, sign consistency cannot be defined in a misspecified setting."

It is also stated that it \"is almost a necessary and sufficient condition for Lasso estimator to be sign consistent\". But the meaning of \"almost\" is never explained. It is my opinion that, if some further discussion were added on this respect, the results could be better appreciated.\n- Is the bound in Proposition 7 expected to be tight under certain regime? When is it loose? It would be good if some details about this could be added.\n- In the discussion of the main results it is said that, because experimentally good regression results are obtained for fairly small K, then this bound \"can be fairly easy to verify\". I think this phrase is somewhat vague.\n- I think it would be good if some heuristic interpretation of why different performances for signatures defined with Ito and Stratonovich integrals are observed.\n\n[following discussion with the authors I raise my rating]"

The universal non-linearity property states that any continuous function of the time series may be approximated arbitrarily well by a linear function of its signature.\nThis paper studies the consistency issue of Lasso for signature transforms.
