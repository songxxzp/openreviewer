It will be better to show the shape of all tensors.\n- There are two insertion patterns. And seems they are both used in the method. Why they should be used at the same time?"

The metric is the aligned RMSD to crystal ligand structures in PDBBind2020, where the structures correspond to the ligand bound to the target protein. This is essentially the same as blind docking, thus the results are not convincing without a thorough comparison to DiffDock (current SOTA in blind docking)."

Problem in contribution and novelty: The authors assert that existing methods in molecular conformation generation have tended to neglect vital pocket-ligand interaction information, positioning their work on transitioning from singleton to pairwise modeling as a key innovation. However, this claim warrants a critical examination. The task undertaken in this paper bears a strong resemblance to docking, a field in which the incorporation of pocket information is a fundamental aspect. Given this context, the purported novelty of integrating ligand-pocket interactions in PsiDiff appears less distinctive, as it aligns closely with established practices in other machine learning based docking methodologies.\n2. The data presented in Tables 1 and 5 highlight a pronounced enhancement in PsiDiff\u2019s performance subsequent to force field optimization. In its absence, however, PsiDiff does not exhibit competitive performance levels, particularly in docking tasks (as shown in Table 5 for the 25th percentile), lagging substantially behind methodologies such as GNINA, GLIDE, and EquiBind/TANKBind. To provide a comprehensive evaluation and fair comparison, it would be advantageous to present results for other baseline methodologies after undergoing force field optimization.\n3.  Some other recent competitive machine learning methods should be added as baselines,  like UniMol(https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6402990d37e01856dc1d1581/original/uni-mol-a-universal-3d-molecular-representation-learning-framework.pdf),  Torsional Diffusion(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01729.pdf), and DiffDock(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01776.pdf), which gives much better docking performance compare to TANKBind as shown in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07134.pdf."
