Different SPLIT method will influence the final result? I think so. Hence, the proposed method indeed depends on the SPLIT method. If not, please conduct experiments for verification. \n3. Will the size of view affect the final result? since in Figure 4, some msvs contain only few image region, while other contain a larger image region. Considering a msv containing more image regions often encodes more information  than a msv containing few image regions, I think msv of different numbers of image regions cannot compare fairly."

                "value": "1.\tThe notion of MSVs in this paper is quite similar to the Sufficient Input Subsets (SIS) proposed in [cite 1, cite 2], which is expected to be discussed in the Related Work section. SIS characterizes the minimal subset of input pixels (pixels outside of this subset is masked) for the model to achieve a certain level of confidence score. In this way, the proposed Minimal Sufficient Views seem to be a simple extension of the Sufficient Input Subsets, so the authors are encouraged to clarify the differences between the two methods.\n2.\tThe previous work [cite 2] has noted an interesting phenomenon: for many images in CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, the size of the Sufficient Input Subsets (SIS) is quite small (e.g., only 5% to 10% of total number of pixels) and pixels in SIS are sometimes located outside of the target object. This means that the model might learn shortcut solutions, such as using blue pixels within the sky region to predict the bird class. Since the definition of MSV is similar to SIS, I wonder if a similar phenomenon occurs in this paper. From the current figures presented in this paper, most MSVs are located on the target object and seem to have clear semantic meanings, but I\u2019m not sure if there are some \u201cfailure cases\u201d in which the MSVs corresponds to patterns that are not related to the target object (e.g., pixels within the sky region or the grass region).\n3.\tAbout the baseline value for masking the image. Although using the average value of the pixels in the training data as the baseline value is a common practice in literature, it is encouraged to test if the derived MSVs and the relationship to the generalization ability are robust under different choices of baseline values. This is because in most views (a masked image), the size of the mask is quite large, thus greatly influencing the output of the model. It is not clear if the current conclusions still hold under a different baseline value.\n4.\tI do not quite agree with the claim that \u201cMSVs with common features were obtained for multiple images\u201d in the same class on Page 6. The notion of \u201cleft eye\u201d, \u201cright eye\u201d are based on human perception, but it is not clear whether the model also encodes these features for inference. Moreover, the MSVs are defined in the pixel space instead of the feature space. It is not appropriate to simply claim that feature \u201ca left eye with circular shape on a black cat\u201d is equivalent to the feature \u201ca left eye with an almond shape on a white cat\u201d.\n\n[cite 1] Carter, Brandon, et al.
