Could the authors give some detailed comparisons and analyses to optimize the topological structure alignment with intra-class and inter-class distances?\n\n2. Since face recognition has made great progress in recent years, the generalized performance is important. I recommend the authors to pay more attentions on the current SOTA on FRVT (https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt11.html) and MFR-Ongoing (http://iccv21-mfr.com/#/leaderboard/academic). It is not difficult to obtain a comparable performance on FRVT and MFR-Ongoing by only using the WebFace260M dataset. For face recognition community, it is more meaningful to certificate that the proposed method can improve the perforamnce of generalized evalutions on age/pose/cross-domain face recognition."

The purpose of providing this observation is not completely understood. Is the author\u2019s point that real world data, face images in particular, have complex topology, that need to be preserved? Then illustrating it with persistence diagrams just having more homology classes representatives as the amount of data\u2019s increase is not enough. One would observe that with any random data of size n in dimension d, as it was shown that the expected k-th Betti number is $\\mathbb{E}[\\beta_k^{VR}(r)] = c_k n(nr^d)^{2k+1}$, with only the constant $c_k$ actually depends on data\u2019s distribution [Kahle11]. In other words, the more data you have the more configurations of r-thickened points could form k-cycles. So what matters is the distribution of persistence diagrams as they would be different for random and real-world data.\n2.\tThe observation b) could be done by not properly normalizing the distance.

Otherwise, the paper becomes an incremental work.\n\n2. Is the pairwise distance computed in Pixel Space (i.e. /matcal{X}) robust enough to estimate the topology? If this is sensitive, it should not be used to guide the learning process of the latent space.\n\n3. In order to produce a good topology for learning process, how many samples should be used for each mini-batch? \n\n4. How is the computational cost of the Structure Damage Estimation process during training? \n\n5. What is the performance of the framework if only Focal Loss is used without SDS ?\n\n6. The results on Figure 5 seems to be a bit tricky as TopoFR is trained with topological structure discrepancy metric. Adopting this metric for comparison will, of course, provide higher performance.\n\n7.
