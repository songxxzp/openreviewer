                "value": "The authors propose an extension to the method of anchoring, Random Anchor Masking (RAM), based on their empirical evaluation of anchoring on more typical Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and tasks than it has been evaluated on in the past. \n\nAnchoring is a recently proposed methodology designed to improve uncertainty estimation of DNNs by representing input samples as the difference (i.e. residuals) from a different randomly chosen sample within the training set (the anchor). As such, when used at inference time, anchored models are better able to estimate uncertainty since the residuals of an input not within distribuition are likely to be quite large. While anchoring has shown some success in uncertainty estimation on small scale benchmarks, the authors highlight that it has not been evaluated as much on more typical DNN architectures/problems, nor has it been evaluated in the context of other problems where distribution shifts occour, such as outliers, generalization under distribution shift and linear probing, calibration, robustness and outlier rejection. The authors proceed to evaluate standard anchoring on these problems with CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100 and ImageNet dataset variants relevant to the problem and on ResNet/WideResNet CNNs and Vision Transformers.\n\nDespite the relatively good performance of anchoring on these problems, the authors are concerned that when the residual is large, such as would be expected in distribution shift, an anchored model may suffer significantly decreased generalization because it overfits the anchor. The authors propose to extend anchoring by simply masking (i.e. zeroing) the anchor (after residual calculation) with a probability $\\alpha$. In other words, they dropout the anchor with probability $\\alpha$, introducing noise in the anchored training process. For a small $\\alpha$ this might be expected to reduce any dependence the model might learn on the anchors themselves and improve generalization on slightly OOD samples. The authors demonstrate results in a similar empirical analysis as used for standard anchoring and compare results with anchored and non-anchored models. Finally, the authors highlight that their results often show a trade-off for RAM/anchoring with generalization and each problem they evaluated, e.g. calibration. They describe how the hyper parameter $\\alpha$ affects this tradeoff, and propose some methodology to mitigate it."

Overall the results across a wide range of problems are quite impressive, again compared to the baselines.\n* The analysis on the trade-off for generalization v.s. each task, e.g. calibration, is welcome and in particular Figure 2 is great to give a high-level overview of what this tradeoff is for some variants of the hyper parameter $\\alpha$."

While the intuition of noisy training reducing the model overfitting on anchors makes sense, the intuition as to why the authors believe anchor overfitting is a problem isn't completely obvious to me.\n* RAM is a very unfortunate acronym to be using in computer circles, while I appreciate the acronym isn't made up and is meaningful, it would probably be best to come up with another one.\n* Not clear to me if the same $\\alpha$ is applied to the whole batch, or is per-sample. The text in section 3.1 makes it sounds like the former, but that doesn't make sense to me, it seems very strange to mask out a whole batch's anchors instead of a random subset, e.g. like dropout.\n* Calibration results appear to be relatively weak, with many of the results presented being within the variance(?) of baselines.\n* The captions of figures/tables and labelling of figures is weak, with little explanation to be found within a figure's caption, and labels missing from elements of figures - e.g. missing $\\alpha$ on the legend of Figure 2(a). Ideally figures and tables should almost be self-contained, but I found myself having to read the text quite a bit to figure out each one.\n* While the authors compare the performance of RAM w.r.t. the models with and without anchoring on standard task-specific datasets (here I use task to loosely mean problems such as calibration, corruption, robustness, etc). For example while using corrupted ImageNet-C, they do not compare with state-of-the-art methods on that dataset. I personally am willing to forgive this, as the authors do not claim state-of-the-art results on these tasks, and appear to be the first to evaluate anchoring on these tasks at all.\n* Little discussion apparently on the effect of adding noise to training on the training time of the model, typically when we add noise to training and make it more difficult, it might be expected that training would take longer to reach the same generalization.\n* Not clear how the $\\alpha$ hyperparameter values found throughout the paper are decided on"

If it is for the whole batch, why would you do it this way instead of per-sample, which aligns more with the objective of adding some noise to training (i.e. dropout).\n* What is the +/- shown in results, as I don't see it explained anywhere in the paper, i.e. is it variance, stddev, ...? Ideally this should be explained in the captions of the figures themselves.\n* Is RAM close to state-of-the-art on any of the datasets it is evaluated with, e.g. ImageNet-C, etc? If not, how far away from SOTA is it, and what do you think it would take to bring anchoring closer to SOTA in these tasks?\n* You claim no computational overhead in section 4.2 for RAM w.r.t. anchoring, which I believe given the method. However, anchoring itself does have a computational overhead over standard methods of training since the first (and most computationally expensive) layer of e.g. a CNN is effectively doubled in size. What is the trade-off on this front? Is the tradeoff reasonable for large models still, i.e. ViT?\n* Furthermore, since we are making training harder vis-a-vis dropout, what is the increase in training time to reach the same generalization as anchored models? What about compared to models without anchoring?"

The main reason for this critique is that the analysis remains empirical observations rather than trying to provide theoretical analysis. Most of the researchers conjecture that random perturbations on inputs, e.g., data augmentations with noise or corruptions, or the interpolations between samples, e.g., a family of methods with Mixup such as Mixup, Manifold mixup, CutMix, etc, are linked to the improved generalization of models by letting models face the diversity beyond clean data sample-wise training. However, pushing the 'high-level conjecture' forward 'theoretical proofs' is crucial. I feel that this work has tried to do that, but is quite limited in providing the empirical observations and conjectures, without theoretical proofs.\n\n**Weakness 2:** It is hard to find an explicit logical link between the proposed strategy (i.e., Random Anchoring Masking) and the understanding of anchoring. Why do we have to randomly mask the anchor in order to improve the generalization? Are there any further insights into the proposed strategy beyond the simple objective of imposing higher diversity on models?\n\n**Weakness 3:** The paper is not well organized. For example, it would have been better to organize Related Work to clearly analyze the previous works on both technical and theoretical sides. I know that the author's analyses of the prior works are spread into multiple sections in this version of the article. However, it is better to show a designated section to emphasize the uniqueness of this work beyond prior efforts is strongly required. Also, I guess that the Conclusion section is missing.\n\nThere are some minor corrections, including typos.\n- In '2.1 Preliminaries', at the 'Notations' part: \"of distinct classes..\" -> \"of distinct classes.\"\n- In the third sentence of '3. An Anchoring Perspective to Generalization': \"it was was\" -> \"it was\""

                "value": "This paper extends the anchoring-based training of deep neural networks with a Random Anchor Masking (RAM) technique. The authors observed that this simple RAM strategy can significantly improve multiple metrics under domain shift setting. The empirical evaluation is conducted on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets, which shows the positive results by considering the RAM technique in anchoring-based training. Another observation is the trade-off between OOD generalization and anomaly detection, demonstrating that models that achieved superior gains in generalization performance tend to exhibit a trade-off in their ability to detect OOD samples. The authors investigated the effect of masking ratio $\\alpha$ on this trade-off."

Especially, there are some evidences that this training strategy can benefit some safety-aware metrics.\n\n2. The proposed masking-based strategy is simple to implement. The empirical evaluation shows the benefits of this simple strategy.\n\n3. The illustrative experiment in Figure 1 shows clear motivation for the proposed strategy, where models training by anchoring+RAM seem can better estimate the uncertainty for corrupted samples."

                "value": "1. RAM proposed in this paper is very simple and easy to implement, which is a great advantage. However, the principle and explanation behind this simple strategy are essential. The authors have provided some motivation for this masking strategy, but further explanation of the underlying principles can further improve the quality of the article. For example, the authors mentioned that \"this noisy training induced by RAM enforces the model to improve smoothness between the target and the residuals leading to better calibrated predictions\". How RAM improves smoothness and how this smoothness leads to better calibration can be further explained.\n\n2. For some other findings in the experiment, such as the trade-off between generalization and OOD detection, this paper only provided some simple experimental results. The reasons behind these phenomena were not deeply analyzed. Is this phenomenon also present in other methods?\n\n3. In inference, multiple random anchors can be used to obtain predictions and the variance can be interpreted as an estimate of the epistemic uncertainty. This is very similar with the simple deep ensemble strategy, the comparison with ensemble-based methods could be provided.\n\nMinor issues: \"was was argued\" ==> \"was argued\", \"results in 2\" ==> \"results in Table 2\", \"Figure 3a depicts\" ==> \"Figure 2a depicts\"."
