Subtracting -1 from all rewards acts like shaping the reward function which might lead to suboptimality as already shown in several works.\n\n(2) Another assumption is that the method of predicting the number of steps that elapse between one observation and another is common. A few works definitely explore this direction, but I think it is more common to simply use a shaping reward over the 0/1 reward function.\n\n(3) In section 4.1, it is unclear in the toy examples when the episode ends.

Will the estimated distance between s and g be 0? Also, if the classifer predicts normalized probabilities, then p(g|s, a2, H=1, 2, 3, ...) cannot be equal to [1, 1, 1, ...].\n\n(3) The algorithm is not completely clear.

Formally defining the state and state-action variant would be helpful to the reader. Something along the lines of:\n\ni) d(s,g) = \\mathbb{E}[\\Delta | s_0=s, s_\\Delta=g], where \\Delta indicates the length of the trajectory and,\n\nii) d(s,g,a) = \\mathbb{E}[\\Delta | s_0=s, a_0 = a, s_\\Delta=g]. This would also make the counter-example showing how this \u201cdistance\u201d violates the triangle inequality more apparent.\n* The temporal consistency objective does not make sense in certain reinforcement learning problems. Some goals can have a minimum number of steps needed before they can be reached. For example, in a gridworld where the shortest path to the goal is 10 steps away, P(reaching the goal in 9 steps) = 0, whereas P(reaching in 10) can be high for a good policy. It would be useful to address this aspect of temporal consistency or even highlight it in an experiment with such temporal constraints, or remove it as it does not naturally stem from the main hypothesis of the paper.\n* Proposition 2 and 3 can be merged together. Proposition 2 is repeated in proposition 3, and the example showing how d(s,g) is not a quasi-metric can be explained alongside the example from V*\n* While this work does acknowledge Contrastive NCE from the literature, the acronym is not explicitly spelled out anywhere. This would be useful to specify.\n\n**Minor Comments/Issues**\n* It would be useful to specify the number of runs that were averaged over in the learning curves of Figures 3, 4, and those in the appendix. The work should also mention what the shaded area around each curve represents and how they curves were smoothed, if any such technique was applied.\n* In section 4.3, P^{\\pi_g} was not defined. It would be useful to clarify it or remove it from the equation (as it only appears once in the main body).\n* On page 11, Yecheng et al. 2022 was included twice in the references."

It is apparent that since the distance conditions itself on reaching the goal the risk of the shortest path is ignored, but the MC distance function is an average number of timesteps elapsed between a state and the goal state. Doesn\u2019t it already account for the stochasticity in action selection?"
