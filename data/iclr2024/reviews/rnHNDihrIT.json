And I assume the basic assumption for this transformation is that all behavior policies $\\mu_{1,..,m}$ are diverse enough, because the authors use transtion-wise action probability to replace the trajectory probability. This makes sense if behavior policies are diverse enough that they take different actions for each step. But if the policies only slightly differ from each other, the consecutive multiplication of all steps within the trajectory will make their trajectory distributions very different from each other (while the action distribution is not much different). As a result, Eq. 2 provides very inaccurate estimation of the posterior.\n2. The proposed SORL needs to know the number $m$ of policy primitives constituting the dataset in order to learn the diverse policies. But it is hard to know this prior under many ciucumstances. I think there should be a study about how sensitive SORL is  to this hyperparameter.\n3. How diverse are the induced policies? The case studies are great but there should be a quantitive study. My further question on this is, if we set $m$ larger than the actual number of policy primitives $\\mu_{1,..,m}$, what will the resulted policies be like?\n4. Some typos, e.g. line 10 in Algorithem 1: $\\mu^{i}$ instead of $\\mu^{1}$\n5. As the author claims the induced policies are high-performing, the baselines should include some strong offline RL methods for comparison. This will also show SORL's advantage in policy diversity compared to them. The current baselines are too few.\n6. How do the authors collect online user data? Where is the user agreement to collect this data? This should appear at least in the appendix."

Through experiments, SORL has been shown to outperform previous methods in generating high-quality and diverse policies, with a notable application being in the basketball video game \"Dunk City Dynasty\". The effectiveness of SORL is evaluated in various settings, including a basketball video game. Compared to other methods, SORL consistently yields better-performing policies that also maintain distinct behavior patterns.

This is particularly relevant in the context of video gaming, where the goal is to develop bots that are not only proficient but also exhibit varied behavioral patterns based on human player data. The authors introduce a purely offline solution that eliminates the need for environmental interaction. This approach is underpinned by a dual-step method. Initially, a clustering technique, leveraging the EM algorithm, assigns trajectories to different clusters by learning  a style-sensitive policy. Subsequently, to foster policies that are both effective and stylistically aligned, Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR) is employed in conjunction with a style-regularization component based on the style-sebsitive policies. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through a series of tests conducted in a simplistic environment, a handful of Atari games, and a commercial video game, all of which confirm the algorithm's capability to generate diverse and competent policies."

Although primarily an online training paper, like infoGAIL, its principles could potentially be adapted for offline training, serving as a relevant comparison.\n\nThere appears to be an implied relationship between what the authors denote as 'style' and the rewards associated with a particular trajectory. Commonly, one might categorize trajectories by skill level, segregating expert from intermediate or novice plays. However, in such a scenario, the operation of the Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR) on these distinct clusters is not thoroughly explained. The connection between the 'style' of play and the 'reward' outcome merits a deeper examination.\n\nThe simplicity of the clustering model raises concerns regarding its ability to discern more nuanced styles, such as specific repetitive actions (e.g., \"jump twice\"). A more critical discussion on the model's capacity to identify and differentiate between complex styles would enhance the paper.The algorithm seems limited in capturing policies that would need memory to characteriwe their styles.\n\nRegarding the implementation of AWR, it seems to be applied to each cluster individually. This approach suggests that in a situation where ten clusters are identified, only one-tenth of the training trajectories are utilized during the AWR phase for each cluster. This potentially limits the method's scalability when dealing with numerous styles, possibly making it impractical for extensive style differentiation.\n\nLastly, the paper could explore the potential of employing more advanced offline reinforcement learning algorithms in the second step of the methodology. Such a discussion could provide insights into improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process in diversifying policies."
