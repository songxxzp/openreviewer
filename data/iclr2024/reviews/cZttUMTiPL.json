For the computationally more challenging case of propagating the full covariance, they propose linearizing the entire network and transforming the input covariance by multiplying with the Jacobian of the network. Empirically, they demonstrate the methods achieve competitive performance on uncertainty quantification and out-of-distribution selective prediction."

Thus, this optimal approximation result does not apply to propagating the full covariance (including the SDP proposed in this paper).\n    - As a compromise for computation efficiency, Section 3.3 proposes linearizing the entire network, including the ReLU activation. The covariance of the output distribution is computed by simply multiplying the Jacobian on the input covariance. Thus, the optimal approximation result in Theorem 1 does not apply either.\n    - If the above are true, it is better to be upfront about it in the main text and state explicitly which method does Theorem 1 apply.\n- Some evaluation metrics are not easy to compare. For example, Table 3 reports the prediction interval coverage probability (PICP, the higher the better) and the mean prediction interval width (MPIW, the lower the better). Each method has different PICP and MPIW which makes it hard to distinguish which one is the best. Since the network outputs a probability distribution, it might be better to report the test log likelihood, which captures the prediction accuracy and the length of the prediction interval simultaneously in a single metric."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- I think some parts of the presentation can be further improved. In particular, while the methods section explains how to propagate uncertainties between layers, it would help to explain how the method is applied to an entire neural net, i.e., what is the recipe needed to go from the formulas in the methods section to getting uncertainties from a general neural network. Perhaps an algorithm float could be helpful for that. Perhaps pseudocode in the appendix would help. Right now, it requires the reader to think for themselves.\n- The theory only works for certain types of activations and distributions. This should be acknowledged and discussed a more clearly in the paper.\n- The computational considerations remain somewhat unclear to me. In the experiments section, training a resnet appears to take 30x longer. There a simpler mar-SDP method that is faster, but it is unclear to me where it is evaluated and what are the pros/cons of going between SDP and mar-SDP. Also, the methods section seems to suggest that computational cost is not a big concern (saying things like \"the Jacobian easy to compute\"), but it's not clear to me why that is the case, especially given the empirical results.\n- The experiments are on very simple datasets (UCI, MNIST). I wonder if the computational cost is something that makes it hard to test on bigger datasets.\n- The experimental results are not entirely convincing. On the UCI table, while directionally things look right, the numbers are often within error bars. The baselines are also not very convincing: in the UCI table, the MC method is known to not be very good in practice. There are probably stronger baselines such as deep ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., NeurIPS 2017), or post-hoc recalibration (Kuleshov et al., ICML 2018), or more recent methods for quantile estimation (Si et al, ICLR 2022). (Perhaps SDP can be combined with these methods)? The second experiment has even fewer baselines, and the table is missing error bars (although they seem to be in the figure)."
