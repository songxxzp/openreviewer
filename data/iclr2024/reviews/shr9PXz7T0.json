The accuracy of this estimation might vary based on the quality and representativeness of these samples.\n- I understand the procedure of cyclic permutation and full permutation, but how are they used as the debiasing methods? Do the authors take the best result of the permutations as the prediction?\n- The authors use the balance of recalls and Rstd as the major metrics throughout the paper. Can the authors formally define this? I didn't immediately get it.\n- The writing and presentation need more improvement, e.g., I think the proposed PriDe is quite intuitive but the authors introduce too many unnecessary notations ($d_i, o_i, g_i, x_i, .... $) before getting into the real introduction of the method, which makes the reading difficult."
