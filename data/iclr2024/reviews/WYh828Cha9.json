                "value": "This paper extends the idea from HRNet of 2D image understanding into 3D point cloud segmentation, yielding a new transformer-based network called PointHR. The key of PointHR is to maintain high-resolution through the whole network, which benefits the dense prediction task. Such design is employed on pure MLPs and efficient attention operators, to formulate a knn-based sequence operator. For verifying the effectiveness of HRNet, experiments are conducted on S3DIS and ScanNet v2 for scene segmentation."

Although the proposed method relies on many existing methods such as point MLP or attention operators, point resampling strategies, the proposed method nicely analyzes, utilizes, and fuses them into a complete pipeline without complicated additional effort, which is straightforward, technically sound, and effective.\n3. The proposed method achieves superior results on S3DIS Area-5 and ScanNetv2.\n4. It is good to see that in Table 4, even using pure MLPs, PointHR can also achieve good results with decent efficiency.\n5. #Params and FLOPs are also listed and compared with other methods, which is meaningful for verifying the efficiency of the proposed PointHR.\n6. Model scalability is explored in Table 3, which is important for the era of large models.\n7. The code implementations are provided in the supplementary material and discussed in the paper.\n8. The supplementary material provides more result visualizations and states the possible limitations.\n9. The memory usage is also compared."

A good literature review is also highly important for a good paper.\n\nMoreover, considering the blossoming of fully-supervised methods in recent years, the new direction of 3D point cloud processing may go to the exploration of self/un-supervised, open-vocabulary, and open-domain methods at the next stage, this paper does not contribute **exceptional** value to 3D point cloud segmentation. Thus, the rating is 6 instead of 8."

KNN in the point sequence operator is also time-consuming especially when the point number is large. Some methods like MinkowskiNet (4D Spatio-Temporal ConvNets: Minkowski Convolutional Neural Networks) and OctFormer (OctFormer: Octree-based Transformers for 3D Point Clouds) also avoid the usage of KNN. The comparison of the FLOPs and performance with these methods is also expected.\n3.

The overall structure follows a similar design of HRNet, as shown in Figure 1, the illustration is very similar to that in HRNet.\n2. The basic raw operator adopts previous designs as in Figure 2, moreover, the formulation of equation 5 is also quite similar to that in PTv2.
