To the best of my knowledge, no other works have proposed this.\nThe penalization $\\lambda$, together with the threshold $\\theta$ could allow practitioners to have more control on how much harm can be \"risked\" by taking an action.\nThis, I find to be a good original contribution.\nFinally, the authors have provided the code used to generate the experiments.

In the section comparing this work to previous MOMAB papers, the authors claim that \"this paper is the first to consider MOMAB in a contextual setting.\" However, it seems that this paper revolves around a single-objective problem, as in equation (1) of the paper. This approach doesn't involve the optimization of Pareto regret, which as far as I know is the central topic in prior MOMAB works. Thus I think it is not so fair to make direct comparsion to previous MOMAB works.\n\n2. The assumptions made in this paper is implicitly strong but not sufficiently clear: Theorem 1's results rely on the existence of a positive lower bound for $\\lambda_{min}(\\Sigma_1)$ and $\\lambda_{min}(\\Sigma_2)$. Implicitly, these bounds necessitate a diversity assumption concerning the distribution of context and action features. Such a strong assumption significantly simplifies the algorithm design of online decision-making. However, I was unable to locate this assumption clearly spelled out in Assumptions A1 to A3. It would be helpful if the authors could present such strong assumption in a more easily identifiable way."

Maybe change the name or reference to $\\epsilon_t$-greedy? Since $\\epsilon$-greedy would give the impression of permanent forced exploration based on static $\\epsilon$ which is not the case here. \n\n* Why is forced exploration (through $\\epsilon$-greedy methodology) required? Is it because of the lack of closed-form expression for confidence width?\n\n* The choice of forced exploration parameter $\\epsilon_t$ is taken to be $\\propto \\frac{\\log T}{T}$ which is typically for the case of vanilla bandits as the confidence width there is also proportional to a similar function in $T$. Why is it the choice here when the confidence width is not discussed?\n\n* There seems to be some mistake in the pseudocode line 3-5 (initialization phase). \n\n* What is the complexity of each inner loop of the $\\epsilon$-greedy algorithm?\n\n5) **Limited experiments**: The experiments seem to be on a much smaller scale with no reasoning on issues taking it to a larger scale or to real-world datasets.\n\nA suggestion would be to rename the algorithm to \"\n$\\epsilon$-greedy\" rather than \"variable coefficient\" (assuming they are the same)\n\nIt is completely possible that I might have missed some context while reading and I am open to changing my opinion on the issues listed"
