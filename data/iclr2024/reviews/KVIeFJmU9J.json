However, there is still a possibility that (1) signal patterns of subjects in the same subset can be different from an input subject, and (2) signal patterns of subjects in the other subsets could be similar to an input subject. In these regards, there should be more rigorous justification of the proposed method.\n\nRegarding the intra-ensemble distillation, it is pushed for the output of the k-th model to the average of the other models. Different models may learn different feature representations, and thus, the model outputs are diverse from each other. Thus, the softmaxed average output could mislead the learning of the k-th model. \n\nAs the OpenBMI dataset defines a two-class classification problem, it is recommended to conduct multi-class classification on the PhysioNet dataset.\n\nIt is wondering how the authors handled the test samples concerning the Riemannian Alignment. In evaluation, we have no prior information about the test samples, especially in the LOSO scenario.\n\nAs for the performance evaluation, the authors argue that the proposed method made substantial improvements compared to the comparative methods considered in their experiments.

While the authors chose that value by exploiting a validation dataset, there should be a more rigorous analysis.

While discussing three related technical approaches, namely 'Domain Generalization', 'Ensemble Learning', and 'Feature Diversity', the categorization of 'Feature Diversity' seems miss leading, especially when referencing work like Wei et al. To provide a consistent thematic hierarchy, renaming this subsection as 'Transfer Learning' or 'Domain Adaptation' might be more fitting to the references used and parallel to the 'Domain Generalization' title.\n\n2. While the manuscript posits the presented work as the first to employ curriculum learning for MI EEG decoding, it could benefit from a broader discourse. The authors might consider discussing methodologies that are related or analogous, such as knowledge distillation, which is prevalent in MI EEG decoding, or exploring other curriculum learning models applied to diverse EEG data types or other biosignals in the related work section.\n\n3. Under the title of domain generalization, there seems to be a mismatch between the cited references and the essence of the approach, as some don't have specific designs for domain generalization, and some references did not even mention domain generalization. I would recommend that the authors review this section and incorporate references that genuinely showcase novel design or training strategies for domain generalization for EEG decoding, where there are plenty of them.\n\n4. The criteria used for selecting the baselines present ambiguities. There seems to be a mix of transfer learning and domain generalization techniques. For methods based on transfer learning, the use of some data from the target domain (test subject) to facilitate transfer is critical. However, this might present a different track compared to domain generalization approaches. The authors should clarify the selection criteria more explicitly and discuss the implications of these distinctions.\n\n5. Relying solely on reported results of baseline models from their original publications, without a consistent reimplementation and testing framework, introduces potential biases in comparisons. This inconsistency is further underscored by the fact that not all methods were tested on both datasets in their original works. To foster a more equitable comparison, it would be beneficial if the authors could reimplement and test these models under unified experimental settings and data preprocessing protocols. Some of the baseline models, like MIN2NET, have their code readily available on GitHub. As such, it should be feasible to test them within the proposed experimental framework."
