Since the schedule for 64\\times 64 image generation is also intuitively setted, why should we align the schedule of high-resolution image generation to 64 \\times 64?\n2) The idea of data-driven ODE noise schedule is interesting, and the authors show that the proposed method is able to improve the sampling quality. Is the newly proposed sampling strategy highly related to the WSNR metric, can we adjust the sampling schedule based on other metrics such as PSNR? The improvement is mainly due to the data-driven framework or the newly proposed metric."

It improves FID of latent diffusion models on FFHQ-128/-256 and ImageNet-256.\n* The authors propose a sampling noise schedule which slightly improves FID on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-64 with 35 network evaluations per image."
