                "value": "The paper introduces JointNet, a novel neural network architecture that seeks to model the joint distribution of images and a dense modality like depth maps. Originating from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, the architecture generates a replica of the initial network for the dense modality, integrating it densely with the RGB branch. Simultaneously, it locks the RGB branch during fine-tuning, ensuring the preservation of the generalization capabilities of the pre-trained model. JointNet\u2019s efficacy is validated across various applications, including joint RGBD generation, dense depth prediction, and 3D panorama generation, positioning the paper as a noteworthy contribution to the field of joint distribution modeling. It highlights a resourceful and efficient strategy that capitalizes on pre-trained models to enhance performance in computer vision tasks."

Considering the network design is a primary contribution of this paper and differs significantly from Direct Extend, the results from Table 1 suggest only a slight improvement in performance due to the proposed network structure.\n- Table 2 reveals that JointNet on its own yields poorer results compared to MiDaS. Although performance improves when combined with MiDaS, the enhancement is minimal, as seen in metrics such as AbsRel (improving from 0.0568 to 0.0561) and a decrease in RMSE (from 0.0601 to 0.0634). These results question the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n- Given the marginal performance difference between the proposed method and MiDaS, one could generate images using diffusion models, input them into MiDaS, and obtain high-quality images and depth maps, raising questions about the necessity of RGBD generation methods."
