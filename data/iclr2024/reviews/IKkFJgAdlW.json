The primary objective of this method is to address domain adaptation issues by employing a data-centric approach that involves generating OOD data samples through the technique of data extrapolation. To this end, an environment-aware framework is proposed, which incorporates linear extrapolation techniques in both the graph's structural and feature spaces. The theoretical underpinnings of this work provide justifications for the causal validity of the generated samples obtained through linear extrapolation, ensuring their tailored nature for specific OOD shifts. Through comprehensive empirical analyses and extensive experimentation, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated, surpassing the performance of existing OOD learning and data augmentation approaches in the realm of graph tasks. The key contribution lies in the innovative design of non-Euclidean-space linear extrapolation, which facilitates the augmentation of both the graph's structural and feature spaces, thereby enabling the generation of OOD samples customized for specific shifts without compromising the inherent causal mechanisms. The obtained results consistently showcase notable improvements across diverse graph OOD tasks."
