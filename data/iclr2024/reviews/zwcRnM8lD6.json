INTRODUCTION \n\n**3rd paragraph:** \n\n- \"identify matrix\":  identity matrix?\n\n- \"The mutual information can be consequently estimated by the entropy decomposition.\": This sentence follows identity matrix addition sentence. I guess it might be better to clarify causality here. At this point, it is not clear what is meant by \"entropy decomposition\", whether it is a trivial procedure and what enables it (mixture of Gaussians modelling?).\n\n### 2.1 BACKGROUND\n\n**Paragraph before (4)**\n\n- After equation (1): instead of \"for a multi-variable Gaussian variable\" use Gaussian (random) vector ?\n\n- In the notation $$X=[x_1,x_2, \\ldots x_n]$$ $x_i$'s appear as column vectors, however, they are actuallly row vectors as $X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$\n\n- (5) should be\n\n$$\\mathbf{H}_D(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{2} \\log \\left(\\lambda_i+\\beta\\right)+(d-k)\\log(\\beta)+C_d$$\n\n- After (5): \"Therefore, LogDet can estimate the entropy of multivariate Gaussian variables by approximating the differential entropy.\". This is not a surprise/or contribution as the authors  simply defined (5) using (2) by replacing the true covariance with $\\beta I$ perturbed sample correlation (covariance?) matrix. This is sort of obvious. \n\n### 2.1.1 LOGDET ENTROPY ESTIMATOR FOR NON-GAUSSIAN VARIABLE\n\n- Title : ... NON-GAUSSIAN VECTOR\n\n- Replace variable->vector\n\n- There already exists GMM based entropy/mutual information approximation based works such as \n\n[a]. Lan T, Erdogmus D, Ozertem U, Huang Y. Estimating mutual information using gaussian mixture model for feature ranking and selection. InThe 2006 IEEE international joint conference on neural network proceedings 2006 Jul 16 (pp. 5034-5039). IEEE.\n\n[b]. Huber MF, Bailey T, Durrant-Whyte H, Hanebeck UD. On entropy approximation for Gaussian mixture random vectors. In2008 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems 2008 Aug 20 (pp. 181-188). IEEE.\n\nYou need to refer to existing literature and clearly state what is novel in your approach relative to them.\n\n\n- Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 of [b] above already covers the lower and upper bounds of mixture of Gaussians. It looks like they are same as what is provided in this section. \n\n- There seems to be a major issue about the upper bound expression. The first expression for the upper bound (at the bottom of page 3), contains covariances ($\\Sigma_i$'s ) obtained from the GMM fitting algorithm, whereas the second line contains the overall sample covariance of actual data, instead of conditional covariance estimates. How do you equate these lines? The second line in fact equals to\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\log \\operatorname{det}\\left(\\frac{X^T X}{n}\\right)+\\sum_{i=1}^K \\pi_i \\cdot\\left(-\\log \\pi_i+C_d\\right)$$\n\nas $\\frac{1}{2} \\log \\operatorname{det}\\left(\\frac{X^T X}{n}\\right)$ is independent of the summation index $i$. This does not make sense as you disregard covariance parameters of the GMM. \n\n- How do you make the upper bound objective co\n\n### 2.2 THE ISSUE OF MODEL SELECTION\n\n- Title: Model Selection is to generic for the discussion in this section. \"The Issue of Model Order Selection\" could be a better title.\n\n\n\n\n### 3. APPLICATION IN SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING\n\nThe logdet-mutual information based SSL appears to be proposed in the following reference:\n\n[c]. Ozsoy S, Hamdan S, Arik S, Yuret D, Erdogan A. Self-supervised learning with an information maximization criterion. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2022 Dec 6;35:35240-53.\n\nThe authors should also clarify the relative novelty relative to [c]. Especially, the impact of GMM order selection as the approach in [c] appears to be for $K=1$. There is also claim in [c] that the use of $K=1$  defines correlative information maximizing which targets a linear (identity in their modified setting) between the representations of augmented versions of inputs. For $K>1$ does  maximizing mutual information between augmentation representation lead to nonlinear mappings between them? Is such organization of representation space desirable for classification tasks, for example?\n\nOr are you just using (18) with order $1$, which seems to be just the approach in [c]. \n\n### 4. RELATED WORKS & 5 SIMULATION STUDIES\n\nAll the references we mentioned above and the relevant references that cite them should be included in this discussion, and simulation results \n\n- 5.2 : ofBelghazi...-> of Belghazi\n- Figure 2: Two small figures and caption could be more informative.\n- 5.4 SSL: What is K for EMP-MILE? Is upper bound employed in EMP-MILE?  what if you directly use MILE?\nHow is backprop used in coordination with the GMM algorithm? As GMM parameters are algorithmically obtained from network output, how does backprop do backward mapping from probabilities $\\pi_i$'s (and there should be covariance estimates $\\hat{\\Sigma}_i$'s, as discussed above)"

For example, in Equations (1), (2), and (10), $X$ is a $d$-dimensional random variable, whereas in Equation (4), $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$ is a data matrix. Even worse, in the final equation of page 3, the two different definitions are used together and it is not even clear where the second equality means; it is simply wrong because $X^T X/n$ does not coincide with $\\Sigma_i$.\n\nUnlike what the authors claim, Equation (5) is not equivalent to Equation (5); the two differ by $\\frac{d-k}{2}\\log \\beta$.  \n\nAdding a matrix proportional to identity ($\\beta I$ in the paper) to the sample covariance was not proposed in a 2021 paper. It is a very classical method that can be found in any classical text on covariance matrix estimation, many decades ago.\n\nThe inequality in Equation (8) was not shown by Zhouyin and Liu in 2021. It is a classical result of information theory, that can be found, for example, in the famous Cover and Thomas book. By the way, the citation to this book is wrong in the paper; one of the authors (J. Thomas) is missing. \n\nThe two bounds for the differential entropy of mixtures that the authors claim to have introduced are in fact not new. The upper bound is in fact a well-known corollary of the log sum inequality (see the Cover and Thomas book). The lower bound was proved in 2008 by Huber et al. at https://doi.org/10.1109/MFI.2008.4648062"

In the context of self-supervised learning, the Gaussian mixture is assumed to known based on the augmentation. In other cases the number of mixture components has to be selected. Empirical results are reported on a synthetic benchmark of correlated Gaussians with and without non-linear transformations. Results of self-consistency measures are reported on CIFAR10."

Differential entropy is easy to calculate for Gaussian distributions, and mixture of Gaussians are universal approximations given enough data, so why not use GMM for mutual information estimation. The insight of using the augmentations as defining the GMM is a useful, simplifying assumption."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "One main weakness is the lack of extensive comparisons of using this method for self-supervised learning versus other. The one example in the main body (Table 1) shows that at 300 epochs the method is better than some other methods but is inferior to EMP-SSL. At 1000 epochs the other methods outperform the listed, but no results for 1000 epochs are reported. \n\nThe second main weakness is the paper does not give a complete description of the method. The paper is lacking in clarity with some key point unaddressed. The notation is confusing since the random variables (Z,Z') are denoted the same as Z_c, which may be a data point in the empirical sample. There should more clarity on random variables as compared to  sample sets, starting back before equation 4. The confusion carries to last paragraph of Section 4 where $\\mathbf{X}$ is defined but then $X$ is used in the definition. \n\nThe use of one instance for one cluster is not clear to me upon reading it\n\"This is because we treat the augmented data from one instance as a cluster, and this data\naugmentation strategy automatically clusters the data.\" This should be re written.\n\n In equation 17 it is not clear how $\\zeta_c$ captures all instances in the batch. It has only a single $i$ index. Perhaps the $\\zeta_c$ should concatenate them all. In section 3.2, $\\zeta_c$ is a set which indexes the whole match, which makes more sense, but it should be a matrix not a set. In any case, how is the $H(Z)$ term estimated in section 3.1? By keeping $Z_c$ fixed and only augmenting the second the one covariance matrix will be rank-1 (before ridge). \n\nIt doesn't sound like the experiments for the 5.2 are run fairly \" our MILE estimator does not require extra training,\" In this problem the point is that the MI could be changing at each data instance. Thus, other methods do not use access to the change points. MILE should have to be run (which involves performing the GMM since there are no self-clusters as in SSL) at each point. Running an expectation maximization is as much or more training than the updates of network.  \t\n\nIn the SSL, the trade-off parameter having to be searched in the grid  [0.01,0.1,1.0,2.0] doesn't seem to be efficient compared to EMP-SSL. \n \nIn terms of unsubstantiated claims, the method is clearly biased (not only by the choice of number of components) but also on the non-linear transform cases. It is not clear how well the mutual information estimation would actually work on more complicated data. Thus, even if it is useful for self-supervised learning is not necessarily a more accurate estimate of differential entropy. \n\n**Minor:**\nThere are a number of typographical mistakes that are distracting.\n\nI don't understand what this means\n\"often dwarfing traditional parametric and non-parametric approaches in statistics\"\n\n\" base on the \" -> \"based on the \" \n\nI'm not familiar with this phrasing \"When X subjects to a Gaussian\" \n\n\"a \u2018noise\u2019 $\\hat{X}$ \" -> \"a noisy $\\hat{X}$\" \n\nThe paragraph before equation (4) are not clear. \" an expanding factor\" is not defined nor is it clear what is meant by \"enlarging the original covariance matrix\".\n\nExtra $=$ on equation 14.\n\n\"trading each\" -> \"treating each\" ? \n\n\" ground true data\" \n\n\"SMILE: moothed\" -> \"SMILE: smoothed\" \n\nIt should be a parenthetical reference for You et al.
