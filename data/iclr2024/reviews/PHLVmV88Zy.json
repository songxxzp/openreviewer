I have updated my score accordingly to an 8.\n\nClassical algorithms for solving linear problems arising from CCA, PLS, and GEP are computationally infeasible (slow and memory-intensive) for huge datasets. The authors formulate top-subspace GEPs via a new unconstrained objective. The main result is then a family of algorithms that solves stochastic PLS, stochastic CCA and deep CCA by applying SGD to this objective. Empirical results show faster and better convergence than previous methods. For the first time, a very large biomedical dataset is tackled with PLS."

(Soundness +) \n- While the material is dense, the paper is clearly laid out and well-written. I particularly like section 2.2 and section 3.2/3.3, which first present general frameworks and then discuss special cases, which is a helpful tutorial-like description. (Presentation +)\n- The paper is of general interest to the community, particularly those interested in (self/un)supervised methods. Unifying theories under a single framework is an attractive story for a paper.\n\nOverall I find this paper to be good quality, however I have low confidence in my evaluation. I am receptive to increasing my evaluation and confidence if the authors can provide a good rebuttal and help clarify my queries."

                "value": "Clarity:\n- I do not see any precise discussion of Barlow Twins or VICReg in the main paper, however Proposition 1 informally states a result related to these formulations. I wonder what is the value in this --- a reader who knows about these formulations might dismiss the informal result (looking at the Appendix instead), and a reader who does not know about these formulations is left completely in the dark. Perhaps section 3.4 could be removed and replaced with a sentence referring to appendix D. (Presentation -)\n- I checked the appendix I.3.4 but was not able to properly understand basic properties of dataset UK Biobank. Are the features in this data categorical, integer, real-valued, mixed, ... ? What are the modelling and \"convenience\" considerations when applying your method? In section 5.4, it is mentioned that \"this can reveal novel phenotypes of interest and uncover genetic mechanisms of disease and brain morphometry.\" What is the precise task that is being performed here, with respect to the PLS formulation (e.g. with reference to the symbols in equations 4, 5, 6, 7)? (Presentation -, and perhaps Soundness -)\n\nMinor and typos:\n- It is not clear what is meant by \"which should be true in general\" in footnote 3. Perhaps if the observations are drawn from a continuous probability distribution, with probability 1 they are linearly independent?\n- Check the references. E.g. \"stochastic optimization for pca and pls\" should be \"stochastic optimization for PCA and PLS\". Perhaps the authors could also seek advice from the area chair (if the paper is accepted) about the most appropriate way to cite the multiple papers with huge author lists (this might be common in other fields where these papers are published, but in ML it looks really bizarre)."

Does the ridge term also change the aforementioned \"notions of uniqueness\" to a stronger notion?\n- \"unlike Gemp et al. (2022) we do not simplify the problem by first performing PCA on the data before applying the CCA methods, which explains the decrease in performance of \u03b3-EigenGame compared to their original work. \" What then is the motivation for not first simplifying the problem using PCA preprocessing?"

The theoretical advantages of such formulation are given, and an extensive experimental benchmark is performed, showing the advantage of the introduced method on several tasks, over state of the art methods."

However, I am aware that such comparison may not always be doable (in particular because the guarantees of convergence for instance, are not always simple to express), so this is just a suggestion,  andI believe the paper in its current form may already provide the necessary information to the reader to study such aspects."
