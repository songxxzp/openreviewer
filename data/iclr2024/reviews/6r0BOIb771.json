                "value": "The paper proposes a new approach to Meta-Continual Learning (MCL) with the aim to mitigate forgetting in nonstationary streams of data. The novel method, called Sequential Bayesian Meta-Continual Learning (SB-MCL) is presented as a combination of meta-learned neural networks and sequential Bayesian updating. The assumption is that for each CL episode, composed of multiple tasks, a single multidimensional latent variable exists and governs the entire episode. Along the episode, the posterior distribution of latent variable conditional on observations is updated step by step with Bayesian updating to accumulate the entire knowledge of the past. The authors propose the use of the Fisher-Darmois-Koopman-Pitman theorem to show that using distributions from the exponential family enables an update that is resistant to forgetting, while not increasing in time the number of required parameters.  On the opposite, using distributions outside the exponential family in a fixed memory scenario, forgetting becomes inevitable. \n\nThe full method uses a neural network encoder (called \u201clearner\u201d) to encode the input as the parameters of an assumed distribution that is used to update the distribution of the latent variable. The posterior distribution is then sampled and another neural network (called \u201cmodel\u201d) produces an output conditioned on the input and the samples from the posterior. \n\nThe encoder and the model are meta-learned across various CL episodes. CL in the inner loop is performed only by Bayesian updating in the latent space, not requiring any gradient computation, enabling to process the stream of data also non-sequentially with the same result. Moreover, this is a way to remove the requirement of computing second-order gradients. The objective of the meta-training optimization is to maximize the log-likelihood of the test set after continually learning from the training stream. Due to the latent variable this function is intractable. The authors introduce a variational distribution of the latent variable (a gaussian distribution) and obtain variational lower bounds both for supervised and unsupervised problems.  \n\nSB-MCL generates a family of models that is tested against other MCL competitors in various settings showing the capabilities of the proposal to mitigate catastrophic forgetting."

The proposed idea shifts the focus of the memorization of past experiences from the weight distribution to the latent distribution, removing completely the need of computing gradients during CL phase. The reasons for this choice are well explained and the use of the Fisher-Darmois-Koopman-Pitman theorem enriches the work with a theoretical grounding on how the exponential family can be of fundamental importance to accumulate knowledge in a memory-constrained environment. \n\nThe derivation of the variational lower bounds used for continual meta-optimization is also clearly done, overcoming the limitations of previous derivations. \n\nThe proposal is tested in a wide range of different tasks, from classification to regression, from generation to image rotation prediction. This confirms the robustness of the idea in different scenarios, improving its significance for the MCL literature. \n\nThe proposed method has also a clear and probably impactful improvement from the computational point of view with respect to other models: the possibility to feed the examples in parallel to the learner and the removal of second-order gradients make the method  quite interesting also from a practical point of view."

                "value": "One of the main ideas of the paper is the use of distributions from the exponential family to accumulate knowledge from the past without increasing the parameters need. The Fisher-Darmois-Koopman-Pitman theorem implies that distributions from the non-exponential family need sufficient statistics of unbounded dimensions to fully capture the information of the data. While the authors acknowledge that models only based on exponential family update are often too simple, they do not address directly what are the consequences of this simplification in their proposal. Probably the use of a strongly nonlinear model (as a neural network) is sufficient to obtain the same learning power as a model that is not limited to exponential family distribution. In any case it would be interesting to directly address this point. \n\nIn a similar way, the sequential Bayesian update with the exponential family has results completely equivalent to having all examples available at the same time. This would solve \u201cby definition\u201d the problem of forgetting. The idea is very interesting, but it should be specified that this is possible due to a simplification assumption on the distribution, and exploring what the consequences of this assumption are. Claiming that this method transforms a CL problem in a underfitting problem should be verified empirically by varying the number of parameters of the neural networks and/or the dimension of the latent space, showing how the memorization ability changes. More importantly this claim is somehow in contradiction with the \u201closslessness\u201d of the exponential family sequential update, implying that, with the increase of tasks, the number of parameters should increase.\n\nOn a higher level, the approach (like any other meta-continual learning framework, in fairness) shifts the forgetting problem from the task to the meta task. Else said, the approach assumes that all meta non-stationarieties are represented at meta-training time. If the meta-test phase characterizes by substantial non-stationarieties the method is bound to fail as it cannot adapt (without incurring once again in catastrophic forgetting at meta level)."

Is there any technical reason why the proposed general model is not tested in all scenarios?\n\nQ2) As a very small note, the plots with the results are not extremely clear to read, with some lines outside the bounds and some others with similar colours and many overlaps."

                "value": "**Using a frozen meta-learned model:** I believe one of the main shortcomings of the proposed method is the fact that the authors propose to freeze the meta-learned network to perform the meta-test.  Freezing the weights extremely limits the plasticity of the framework and I believe Bayesian learning by itself is not enough to address the \"different enough\" tasks. Also, Using a frozen meta-learned network is analogous to using a pertained model which usually defies the purpose of CL. The end goal of CL is to put the network in scenarios in which truly unseen data are encountered and the network should learn to **adapt** to the new environment while maintaining its previously learned knowledge. I believe freezing is not a good way of maintaining the knowledge and Bayesian learning is not expressive enough to be plastic as it is evident in the qualitative result. The VAE reconstruction results look blurry even for nist-type images.  \n\n**Motivation:** I am having a hard time finding a realistic scenario to deploy such a framework. For instance, it seems too restrictive to train VAEs continually while only seeing the data once. At least in the context of generative models, we usually do not operate in such restrictive scenarios. \n\n**Evaluations:** This is tightly related to the first issue. The meta-training tasks are very similar to the meta-testing ones. I believe it is necessary to evaluate the expressiveness of the Bayesian learning approach on more diverse tasks. \n\n**plots:** There are too many plots in Figure 3. Not all of them are informative and some should definitely be moved to the appendix. The message would be better conveyed if we had more tables in the main body instead of a large number of plots in just one figure. The legends are better to be close to the actual plot. It is not easy to match the colors in the top rows to the legend in the bottom row. Also, some of the gray trends (denoted by \"standard\" in the legend), are out of the plot frame. Especially the one in the bottom right."
