TP-BERTa has been trained on a combination of 101 classification datasets and 101 regression datasets.

This tokenization process enables the language model to comprehend relative value magnitudes within the language representation space. Additionally, the paper showcases the intra-feature attention (IFA) mechanism that fuses feature names and their corresponding values attentively.
