                "value": "The authors present a method for incorporating b-spline interpolation into a factorization machine (FM) framework for online content recommendation systems. Factorization machines have attractive properties in high-throughput production recommendation systems where inference speed is needed. Existing factorization machine frameworks use binning, which amounts to an overly crude, non-smooth interpolation approach.  Basis function interpolation is proposed as an alternative which can fit into the overall FM approach, with b-splines being the basis used in the paper. The b-spline FMs can be mapped onto a binning approach with many bins if that mapping is convenient for existing production software systems.  The approach is illustrated on toy data, on a suite of modest-size real world tabular data and (most importantly) in an A/B test of a major online advertising platform in which a dramatic improvement was achieved, with click-through-rate prediction error dropping from 21% for the previous system to 8% with the b-spline FM approach."

I was previously familiar with the basics of factorization machines, but I'm not an expert on them, so I'm not 100% sure the work is original, but as far as I know, it is. \n\nThe paper is extremely well written. I caught a couple of typos which I will list in the weaknesses section, but overall, the paper was very easy to read and understand. \n\nAs I'll say in the weaknesses, I would like a little more info on why factorization machines are needed rather than matrix factorization and how widespread factorization machines really are in recommendation systems. That's my one hesitation regarding significance. If I can be reassured in that area, I'd feel even better about the significance and would raise my score."

Related to that, I would like understand why matrix factorization is not appropriate for the recommendation problem the authors are concerned with at the advertising platform. The paper doesn't even mention matrix factorization. It surely deserves at least a brief mention so that readers understand why it's not the best solution here. \n\nI probably represent something like the median reader in terms of pre-existing familiarity with the topic. I do not work actively in recommendation systems, but I once published a recommendation systems paper (one based on matrix factorization) about a decade ago.  A Google Scholar search for  ' \"matrix factorization\" recommendation systems' yields about 10X more results than ' \"factorization machines\" recommendation systems and the Yehuda Koren paper on matrix factorization is much more widely cited than the original Rendle factorization machine paper. So I was a bit surprised that the paper basically seems to take it for granted that a reader would understand that factorization machines are commonly used in recommendation systems. \n\nRelatedly, I would like to hear more detailed examples of what the fields typically are.  On the bottom of page 1, the authors say the fields are \"past interactions between users and items\" but the language elsewhere in the paper makes it sound like it's often just descriptors of the item and/or user rather than data on the interaction between them.\n\nGranted, factorization machines and matrix factorization are a bit similar in spirit in that they both represent interaction parameters with low-rank matrices, i.e, dot products between vectors of free parameters, but they're fundamentally different approaches.FM is essentially polynomial regression with the coefficients of the regression being constrained to live in a low-rank subspace so as to overcome the curse of dimensionality, with the regression predictors being encodings of fields, as the authors describe. On the other hand, in (the simpled form of ) matrix factorization, each user and each item is represented as a vector of parameters (to be fit in training) and the interaction between user and item is represented as the dot product between the 2 vectors. So why is this approach not appropriate for the problem the authors tackle?\n\n\nTypos:\nPage 4 weather the bins -> whether the bins\nPage 5 Lemma 1: Equation equation 1 -> equation 1\nPage 5 do no depend -> do not depend \nPage 5 suppose that \u2026 be -> suppose that \u2026 are\nPage 8 closely related FwFM - > closely related to FwFM\n\n\n**** Update after rebuttal *****\n\nI appreciate the explanation regarding the motivation for using FM instead of MF. Nonetheless, I will keep my score the same. I agree with reviewer zL9t that the absence of Criteo benchmarking is a concern."

In the age of foundation models, there is still a practical need for models which can be applied to situations where fast training and inference are crucial.\n\nThe theoretical component is sound. I checked the proofs in the appendix and did not find any errors. The theoretical results also give a clear picture of the advantages of the proposed method. For instance, a natural question in this setting is, if we desire to have a function class which is more expressive for continuous features, can we simply *not* discretize the numerical feature to avoid ending up with a piecewise continuous function? What is the benefit of encoding it with basis functions? Their lemmas answer this question: this is equivalent to \"encoding\" the feature using the single basis function $B_1(z) = z$. Their results show that the resulting function must be linear in the numerical feature when all other features are held constant. I also found the discussion of the results, and some \"informal\" theoretical motivation (e.g., that the approximation error should be $O(1/\\ell^k)$ for their method vs. $O(1/\\ell)$ for naive binning, where $\\ell$ is the number of bins/break points and $k\\leq 3$ is the number of continuous derivatives of the function to be approximated) to be helpful.\n\nThe empirical results are also solid. They conduct experiments on synthetic data, four publicly available real datasets, and a proprietary real-world click-through rate setting, all of which show gains for their method over the binning approach.\n\nThere is also a candid discussion of the drawbacks of the proposed method, including a decrease in interpretability as compared to binning, and situations in which the user may expect the proposed method to actually have *worse* performance as compared to binning. This discussion improves the usability of the method.\n\u00a0\nFinally, I am not an expert on FMs, but at least based on the cited related work, the contribution is novel."

Given that it seems that the function used to generated the data matches the cubic splines very closely (see also the Questions section below), this is somewhat surprising. If it is just a case of a small number of trials (15), the authors should run more experiments to show that there is a significant separation.\n\nThe empirical results on real-world advertising data are certainly impressive. However, since both the base algorithm (\"a proprietary FM family click-through-rate (CTR) prediction model that is closely related to FwFM\", pg. 8) and the data are proprietary, these results cannot be verified. Any additional information that can be provided on these results, such as the scale of the dataset or measures of uncertainty on the difference in accuracy, would be helpful.\n\n**Presentation:** There are some typos and other presentation issues that detract from the paper. For example:\n- The term \"segmentized function\" is used throughout the paper. I think this means a piecewise function, but I didn't see this defined explicitly anywhere.\n- The term \"field\" is used to refer to a component of the base tabular dataset. Since there is a significant theoretical component to the paper, this may be confused with a field in the mathematical sense, so it should be defined explicitly.\n- In Section 3.4, there is a \"plain English\" explanation of how the method can be integrated into an existing binning-based pipeline. A mathematically precise algorithm description would be helpful to understand this procedure (see the Questions section below).\n- \"easier\" is repeated twice in the sentence beginning \"Moreover, to make integration...\" (second to last paragraph, pg. 2)\n- Double period in point (a) of the summary paragraph (last paragraph, pg. 2)\n- \"Equation\" is often repeated when referencing an equation number, e.g. first sentence of Section 3 (pg. 4), statement of Lemma 1 (pg. 5)\n- There is a minor notational inconsistency in Fig. 2: presumably, the \"rows of $v$\" in the caption refers to the matrix $V$ in the figure.\n- The \"matrix\" $\\mathbf{P}$ defined in the appendix is not really a proper matrix, since the rows do not all have the same dimension. Defining the individual vectors $\\mathbf{P}_i$ would be more mathematically conventional than stacking them into a jagged matrix, but this is minor.\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list.

Instead of trying to learn these directly from data, which will have sparsity issues, we first learn using the basis function approach. We then compute the embedding vector output by the basis function model at the midpoint of each bin, and use these as the \"learned\" embedding vectors for the binning model. Is this correct?\n\n2. What are the functions $p_i$ in the synthetic experiment? They seem to be a very similar shape to the cubic splines; are these functions themselves cubic splines? If so, is the reason for the error of the proposed method just due to a finite training set?\n\n3. A more general question about FMs: Based on equation (1), it seems like an FM is a feature embedding + a second order polynomial regression, where there are no \"diagonal\" (i.e., those of the form $x_i^2$) second order terms. Perhaps there are some other restrictions on the coefficients that one can get for the resulting quadratic, based on the form of (1). The intro did a good job explaining why these methods are preferred over larger models like neural networks when fast inference is a necessity. My question is, is there a specific benefit or motivation for this particular form of model which makes it preferable to a general quadratic function? Either a discussion of this or a pointer to a specific reference would make the paper more accessible to readers who are unfamiliar with FMs."

Overall, I believe substantial revisions are needed to enhance the clarity and presentation of the paper.\n- An important question that I could not find the answer in the paper is that why do we need to transform features into step function like features? Instead you can use neural networks as an example to produce a representation for each given feature vector and then the learned representation can be employed to train a model. This probably can be added as a baseline to the evaluation section.\n- Based on my understanding, this paper focuses on improving factorization machine based methods and in section 4 the proposed method performance is only compared to factorization machine based models. I believe the paper does not motivate the importance of study well compared to simple methods such as representation learning with neural networks. This limits the contribution of this paper."

This is similar to the kernel trick in  non-linear regression, except that this is done in the context of factorization machines, which by definition also involve second order terms. In Lemma 1, it is shown that this encoding results in the learned functions taking the form of spline functions of the numerical feature whenever all other features are fixed. In Lemma 2, it is shown that if the procedure is applied to two features instead, then the resulting functions (when fixing all other features) are arbitrary products of spline functions (essentially, ``low rank spline functions\"). The authors also propose ``integrating\" the model into existing factorization machines by discretizing the output into bins. Experiments are performed on some synthetic datasets which show that the model learns the ground truth functions better than the traditional discretization approach. On real data, an improvement is shown compared to the baseline on CTR prediction datasets, and the results of A/B testing on a real world proprietary platform are shown: the performance improvement was significant and sufficient to convince the company to adopt the paper's method"

Why specifically factorization machine: I am also not sure why the authors specifically choose factorization machine as the authors seem to be addressing a generic feature representation problem (again, going back to my point 1 that I feel unsure whether the problem is \u201creal\u201d).\n4. I am also feeling a bit unsettling about the citations: many very old results related to spline most relevant to this work, some relevant new results that dont appear in premier venues, and some recent neurips-tier results that are only briefly discussed. It will be helpful to better connect this work with recent development of ML as I suspect not many understand this click through rate business these days (I thought the standard approach is some neural nets with many features these days?)."
