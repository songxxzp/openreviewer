The paper can discuss the limitations and potential biases of the dataset.\n\nIn Appendix A.1\uff0c Insufficient evaluation of the knowledge graph: This article utilizes a knowledge graph embedding method that combines TransR with RotatE.Different knowledge graph completion methods may have different impacts on the results. This article does not provide comprehensive evaluation results for the generated knowledge graph. The quality and accuracy of the knowledge graph are very important for the subsequent tasks.\n\nIn Section 4\uff0c this article introduces a module to predict changes in patient condition but does not explain the accuracy of this prediction. It can also clarify how SCEIKG handles patient-specific changes to better understand and model individual differences, which may help improve the accuracy of the model and personalized recommendation ability.\n\nIn Appendix D\uff0c This article mentions the issue of herb compatibility in herbal recommendations but does not provide specific solutions to address this compatibility problem.\n\nOverall, the paper presents an innovative approach to TCM recommendation, but further clarity and validation are needed. The use of interaction graphs is promising, but practical implications should be explored in more detail."
