These modifications do not seem very principled and are more like heuristics. In the case of SAE, it seems like one simply increases dimensionality by a factor, although I could be wrong since I'm not familiar with the SAE method.\n\nThe paper includes experiments claiming to demonstrate the difference between vectorization and increased dimensionality. These show that for an \"ideal\" representation, both vectorized and scalar methods perform well. But this observation fails to demonstrate the difference between vectorized methods and increased-dimensionality scalar methods in non-ideal settings. A more straightforward comparison between vectorized methods and matched-dimension scalar methods would be more conclusive."

They then use apply them to a handful of models in order to probe their disentanglement and generalisation properties.

The authors also cite Singh et al., (2022) but don't mention that this reference talks about compositional generalisation and vector valued representations. This is the most relevant reference for this study, yet there is no discussion about the relation between the two.\n2. Section 2.2 is a bit confusing and needs a rewrite. As currently written, it is stated that disentanglement has not been considered when studying generative models, but the authors themselves stated before that both Montero et al. and Xu et al. study both in the VAE-based setting, a generative model. So which one is it? Also, Xu is not the only one to use random splits. Schott et al., also dies this.\n3. The structure based disentanglement needs much more details to be understandable. The short explanation and the figure are not nearly enough to understand why this is an interesting model to test.\n4.

                "value": "- It appears that one of the main experimental findings of the paper (the fact that vector valued representations are correlated with improved compositional generalization) may be conflated with the simple increase in dimensionality resulting from increasing the dimension of the latent space. Specifically, in Table 1, it appears the authors did not maintain a comparable latent dimensionality between their scalar-valued and vector-valued models. (For example, it currently appears all vector valued models have a latent dimensionality which is D-times bigger than the scalar valued baselines). As shown by the authors in Figure 2, this simple increase in dimensionality yields dramatic improvements to compositionality metrics even for the vanilla baseline Vec-AE. The authors attempt to address this concern in Section 6.4, Table 3, however they only compare 2 models on a single dataset, and furthermore do not include standard deviations (!). Unfortunately, given this is one of the main results of the paper, I believe this is insufficient. All scalar-valued baselines for Table 1 should have consistent total dimensionality with the vector valued counterparts, especially considering this is shown to have a significant impact on performance. I would ask the authors to include these results in a rebuttal in order to have faith in the main claims of the paper.\n\n- The extension of scalar valued models to vector valued versions is a bit confusing and ill-defined, as outlined below:\n\t- Equation (5) is confusing due to potential overload of indexing notation. It would be helpful if the authors put bounds on their sums in this case so that it is clear exactly which vector is being referred to by z_j. Is this the j\u2019th vector (of dimension D)? Or a new vector composed of the j\u2019th dimensions of all other vectors (E.g. something like [z_{0,j}, z_{1,j}, z_{2,j}, \u2026, z_{m,j}])?\n\t- If I understand equation (5) correctly, the new Total Correlation loss is really only seeking to minimise the element-wise total correlation of the individual vectors, meaning for example that the second dimension of the first vector (z_{1,2}) and the first dimension of the second vector (z_{2,1}) have no penalty on their correlation. Similarly, for the dimensions within a vector, there is no constraint on correlation. Is this true? If so, this seems like a quite significant departure from the original TCVAE idea. It would be appreciated if the authors could provide greater motivation for why this is a good disentanglement loss in their model.\n\t- The derivation of Equation (5) in the appendix is not given. The authors derive why the original approximation is no longer fit, but then simply propose the new total correlation loss without much discussion. Further justification of this loss should be included. If the authors could comment on that here, that would be greatly appreciated.\n\t- A more detailed description of all vector valued methods should be provided (for example the Vec-FactorVAE should be described entirely in the appendix).\n\n- Some references to related work are missing. Notably, there is a line of work related to the discovery of vector-valued directions in latent space which correspond to disentangled transformations [1,2,3]. It would be helpful if the authors could address this line of work as well, as I believe it is at least related conceptually. \n\n- The authors provide little to no intuition for why a vector valued representation may achieve compositional generalization better than a scalar value counterpart.\n\n- In Table 1, the authors bold their values (for FactorVAE metric and DCI) which are not significantly above the baseline scalar-valued models. This is potentially misleading, and the authors should either bold all values that are not statistically significantly different, or they should remove the bolding.\n\n[1] Christos Tzelepis, Georgios Tzimiropoulos, and Ioannis Patras.
