Please see \"questions\" for detailed comments.\n\n- Another main concern is whether the model is causality-based or just capture temporal relations. In addition to the concept of causal relation, I didn't see how the implementation reflect the tools of causal inference or causal reasoning. Therefore, I am wondering whether the causal understanding ability is over-claimed. Experimental results can verify the ability empirically, but theoretical explanations or guarantees are missing.\n\n- The ablation studies in Table 4 mainly demonstrate the contributions of sub-networks rather than the role of historical states and environment. What if we replace the historical states and environment with wrong ones? What is the performance then? That would show that the performance drop is due to the lack of visual information rather than fewer parameters.\n\n\n---\n\nAfter rebuttal: the authors' responses addressed my concerns including causal theory, ablation studies, and clarification on terminologies.

The abstract mentioned that the proposed LLCP employs a temporal multivariate generative model to understand the causal patterns. I am not aware of how the *temporal* model can discover *causal* relations. I am wondering how to guarantee that the learned pattern are causal relations rather than temporal correlations using the so-called temporal model? In the method part, I am not aware of how the learned pattern are causality rather than correlation.\n\n3. I didn't find strict definitions of historical state, neighborhoods, and environment variables. Could the authors provide a precise and accurate definition, or give examples of these three variables? For example, are they features of a single frame, an object, or a set of tracked frames? How does the object tracking model obtain these three variables in temporal and spatial dimensions? It seems that Figure 4 provide an example, but it appears a bit late when I was reading Sec. 3.1 but didn't find the examples.\n\n4. In Ex. (2), is x_{t,i} an image (or region of interest) or feature vector?\n\n5. According to Figure 4, the question seems to be the input of text side rather than video side. In this case, how can we determine the object of interest when extract the visual information and make the prediction of visual states? Is it reasonable to extract question-independent visual feature to answer the question?\n\n6. What does the arrows mean in Figure 5? Are they drew manually or automatically estimated by the model?"

It is also not realistic to exclude the text query from the training process since the fusion between visual and textual input is also the crucial design to really solve the VQA problem.

                "value": "The paper in question exhibits a commendable level of originality by shifting the focus of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) from pattern recognition to causal reasoning, an approach that has not been extensively explored in this field. The introduction of the Learning Latent Causal Processes (LLCP) framework marks a creative synthesis of self-supervised learning, generative modeling, and natural language processing, tailored to decipher the causal dynamics of video content without relying on annotated question-answer pairs. This methodological innovation reflects the paper's high quality, as it seemingly adheres to rigorous empirical standards and offers a robust validation on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In terms of clarity, the paper articulates its contributions and methodologies with precision, making the novel concepts accessible and understandable, which is indicative of the authors' commitment to effective communication of complex ideas. The significance of this work is multifold, promising to reduce the need for labor-intensive labeled data in VideoQA, enhance the interpretive and interactive capabilities of AI systems with causal reasoning, and potentially influencing a range of applications where understanding the underlying causal relationships in visual data is crucial. Overall, this paper appears to make a substantial and meaningful contribution to the literature, potentially setting a new course for future research in the AI domain, with implications that extend beyond the immediate scope of VideoQA."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "In the paper, potential areas for improvement include enhancing the model's robustness to spurious correlations and label noise, more explicitly demonstrating LLCP's ability to capture causal relations through additional experiments, and benchmarking its causal reasoning against current approaches. The paper could also benefit from a more detailed discussion of the challenges in video reasoning it aims to address and a clearer explanation of its operation independent of established causal frameworks and annotations. Finally, a dedicated section that explicitly outlines the paper's limitations and assumptions would add transparency and guide future research directions. Addressing these points could strengthen the paper's contributions and its value to the VideoQA field."
