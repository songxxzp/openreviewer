The assumption 2 seems not to be very clear. Can you explain how to achieve it in the algorithm? \n\n4. The client sampling mechanism seems to be unclear. Is it informative? Which information is leveraged for the sampling? \n\n5. Could the results be extended to non-convex cases? I would suggest to both include analysis and experiment on non-convex learning problems."

                "value": "- From an optimization perspective, assuming the logistic regression as an experimental setting is ok, but this is a machine learning venue; it has been a norm to consider more difficult objectives to test the hypotheses. It is a weakness not to consider a setting similar to what most of the FL algorithms are tested in.\n\n- Similarly to the experimental case, providing theory in the convex case, given that FL is mainly applied in nonconvex settings with neural networks, could be improved. While the reviewer appreciates that there is a continuation of works (from specific research groups) that aim to cover every possible problem setting (as summarized in Table 1 of the paper), the current work (theoretically and practically) cannot be readily appreciated (and put among other works) on nonconvex neural networks FL setting.\n\n- I might have missed it, but the difference between this work (along with the accompanying difficulties in completing the algorithm and proof) and the 5GCS is not clear from the text. Table 1 claims that that work did not satisfy the CC column. However, how difficult was it to complete the CC column on top of the work of 5GCS? What were the challenges? What was the amount of additional difficulty in completing this work? Was it incremental or substantial?\n\n- The paper does not explain why assumptions 2,3,4 should hold in practice and under which conditions. They are hard to digest and read like proof, enabling assumptions\n\nOverall, This reads like rigorous work. Yet, this score is due to the lack of generalizability of the results to more FL settings, lack of experimental results on FL scenarios, and lack of proper description of (differences with) prior work."
