It balances between selecting tasks of moderate difficulty for the learning agent to solve and proposing tasks that are similar to the target distribution. The metric for sampling tasks is derived in a specific learning scenario and is then applied to other more general settings. In implementation, the method involves sampling a discrete pool of tasks from the uniform and target distribution of tasks and prioritizing the learning of the tasks proportional to the proposed metric. The experiments are conducted in both binary sparse reward and dense reward environments to solve various target distributions of tasks."

It is not unconvincing to directly apply the curriculum strategy derived from the simple scenario in Sec 3.1 to the general case in Sec 3.2, since the simple scenario is with specific action and reward settings.\n2. The metric for task similarity is a bit specific to the tasks. Currently, the metric is defined based on the L2 distance of context parameters. However, there are many cases where such a metric is not positively correlated with the intuitive similarity between tasks. For example, consider a table-top manipulation environment with a drawer and a cube on the table. Suppose the initial state is with the drawer closed and the cube on the table outside the drawer. Consider a desired state A with the cube on top of the closed drawer and a desired state B with the cube inside the closed drawer. Suppose the context parameters are defined as the open width of the drawer and the pose of the cube. We can see that the L2 distance between A and B is small, but the complexity of strategies to reach A and B is different: reaching state A only requires one pick-and-place while reaching state B requires opening the drawer, placing the cube, and then closing the drawer. It is inappropriate for the curriculum to treat these tasks as similar, and I think a better metric for task similarity is required.\n3. Fig. 2(b) shows that PROXCORL performs similarly to PROXCORL-UN in PointMass-s:2G environment. Since the target task distribution is non-uniform in this environment, the result weakens the contribution of the proposed curriculum that takes task correlation into consideration."

And the approximation yields a curriculum strategy. According to the theoretical derivation, the authors propose the task selection strategy in the general setting of contextual MDP with arbitrary target task distributions.\n\nThe experiments are conducted on the tasks of sparse goal-reaching and bipedal walker stump tracks.
