PMLR, 2023.\n\nThough [2] tackles value-based methods I think it is still worth discussing. Similarly, the method in [3] learns the best set of states to switch from using a decentralized critic to centralized critic. I caveat this with the fact that the specific algorithms involved in [3] are value-based methods but given that it is plug & play, the method seemingly captures gradient methods.Without having included a discussion on [3], it is hard to know how much this approach could be useful since the authors' approach has a fixed weighting parameter for all states whereas the approach in [3] can be viewed as a weighting variable whose optimal value {0,1} is learned for each state. \n\n\nThe theoretical analysis though insightful didn't allow me to fully grasp an improvement in the performance of the proposed method with regard to variance and bias. I was expecting to see some results that indicate that for a given variance, the method achieves a reduced level of bias and similarly, for given level of bias the method would achieve a lower variance as compared to the standard objective. This has been shown nicely in the ablation study but I didn't see the corresponding analytic statements for this. \n\nIt is not clear if there are situations where this method would under-perform. For example, I can see a potential for choosing greedily over either $Q^\\pi$ or $Q^\\nu$ yielding locally optimal actions but doing the same over their convex combination yielding a poor action. I would like to have seen a discussion on whether this is possible and under what conditions. \n\nMinor\n\nOn page 6 it is written that the assumption of the Lipschitz smoothness of the gradient is reasonable since \"Q functions tend to be smooth in most environments\". I think this is slightly problematic since in many RL environments, the reward is sparse in these environments, so even the Q function is not so smooth. Besides, the smoothness of the Q functions does not suggest smoothness of its gradient."

In this review's opinion, this makes the result incremental and not novel and significant enough for consideration at this venue. \n\n(2) A number of inconsistencies with the notations that make it hard for the average reader to precisely follow the claims of the paper. For instance, the notations $\\nabla J$ and $\\nabla \\hat{J}$ are used interchangeably whereas they are not the same (look at and compare equations (1), (10), and (12)). Also, $\\hat{Q}$ is used in equation (12) despite it not being properly defined until equation (14). Plus, sometimes the notations $\\hat{Q}$ and $Q^\\mu$ are used interchangeably even though they are clearly different when $Q^\\mu$ is not in the function class $\\mathcal{Q}$. \n\n(3) There seems to be a mistake in the proof of Proposition 4. The upper bounds $\\frac{1}{2} L \\sigma^2$ and $L \\sqrt{mn}$ are supposed to be on the absolute value of the difference of $Q^\\mu (s,a)$ and its first order estimate (initialed at $\\mu(s)$); however, they are apparently used as upper bounds on $(Q^\\mu (s,a) - \\overline{Q}(s,a))^2$. So it seems the result should have been something like $c_1 L^2 \\sigma^4 + L^2 mn \\sigma^2$ instead of $c_1 L \\sigma^2 + L \\sqrt{mn} \\sigma^2$ which would change the final bound as well. \nOn another note, the absolute value should be outside the expectation for the second term in the last inequality of equation (27), and that is what makes the last argument of the proof (Proposition 4) possible."
