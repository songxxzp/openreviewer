The paper presents the COSMOS framework, which utilizes model confidence to adaptively select among models with varying strengths for distinct subpopulations. COSMOS does not necessitate target labels or group annotations, making it suitable for situations where obtaining such information is challenging. Nevertheless, this approach lacks adequate experimental analysis and falls short in the interpretability of its algorithm design."

COSMOS adaptively chooses models depending on their appropriateness for various inputs, taking into account both shortcut and invariant classifiers. The proposed approach does not depend on target labels or group annotations, making it applicable in situations where such information is inaccessible or challenging to obtain.\n\n- This paper has a clear and rational motivation that advocates for treating shortcut and invariant classifiers equally, with both being experts in different regions of the input space.\n\n- This paper provides a comprehensive formal definition of the problem, including the problem setting and formal intuition.\n\n- To a certain degree, the algorithm in this paper demonstrates experimental results that the model can maintain satisfactory performance for majority groups while enhancing the performance of minority groups."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The COSMOS framework assumes that test data is provided in a batch format, with multiple inputs available at once for model selection. However, in real-world situations, particularly in medical diagnosis where subpopulation shifts are common, test data may be received in a streaming manner, processing one sample at a time.\n\n- The algorithm's design lacks interpretability. The analysis did not take into account the relationship between the algorithm's design and the use of shortcut and invariant features, nor did it explain why different classifiers can use various combinations of these two features instead of relying on the same shortcut features.\n\n- COSMOS' performance depends on the abilities of the base classifiers. If the base classifiers are similar, COSMOS may not offer significant improvements.\n\n- Another drawback related to numerous base classifiers is the need to train multiple base classifiers, each with potentially different architectures or training backbones. This increases the complexity and computational cost of the training process, as each base classifier must be trained and calibrated individually. Managing and optimizing multiple training pipelines can be difficult, particularly when working with large-scale datasets or complex models. In comparison to many existing methods that only require one base encoder (e.g., see [1, 2] and benchmarking methods in [3]), COSMOS displays increased training complexity.\n\n- As the paper focuses exclusively on spurious correlations as a type of subpopulation shift, it neglects the wider variety of subpopulation shift types found in the literature. According to [3], subpopulation shifts can take many forms, such as attribute imbalance and class imbalance. Real-world datasets often exhibit multiple types of shifts at the same time, and the paper does not discuss how COSMOS would perform in these situations. As a result, the paper's limited scope undermines its generalizability and applicability to real-world datasets that may display different types of subpopulation shifts.\n\n- The paper does not offer a comprehensive comparison with current state-of-the-art methods, making it challenging to evaluate COSMOS' relative performance and advantages compared to other techniques.\n\n- Although the paper proposes considering metrics beyond worst-group accuracy (WGA), it only evaluates regret and does not acknowledge the tradeoffs between other essential metrics and their interactions. Recent research on subpopulation shifts [3, 4] has shown that metrics such as calibration error (ECE) or worst-case precision may conflict with WGA. As a result, it is crucial to carefully consider the limitations and potential trade-offs of alternative metrics when assessing the performance of the proposed COSMOS framework. How does COSMOS perform on those metrics?\n\n- The ablation experiment is insufficient. The authors did not examine whether this advantage is due to the presence of TS. Moreover, if random selection or other selection methods are used among K classifiers, it is unclear whether the results will differ. It remains uncertain whether the advantage of the results is due to the integration of multiple classifiers.\n\n\n\n_[1] Distributionally robust neural networks for group shifts: On the importance of regularization for worst-case generalization.
