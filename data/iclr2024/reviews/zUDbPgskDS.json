                "value": "This paper proposes a general framework, CrysToGraph, for crystal materials property prediction. The overall idea is to encode the crystal graph into an embedding representation, and use this representation for classification or regression tasks. More specifically, the inputs are composed of the atom node embeddings, edge embeddings and angle information for edge pairs. These features first go through edge-engaged transformer graph convolution (eTGC) to extract phase-1 embeddings for atoms and edges. Then the Graph-wise Transformer (GwT) iteratively update atom node encodings by absorbing `information` from connecting edges. The final output goes through an FFN layer and produce an embedding for regression or classification task. The proposed model is tested on 8 datasets and achieves significant improvements over prior papers."

In section 3.3, while I think the contents are organized well by explaining the architecture of each sub-module one by one, it would be better to further explain the motivations behind each sub-module, since the proposed system is large and complicated. I can see section 4.2 gives some hints, but some more elaborated explanations would be better.\n3. The authors did a quite thorough analysis on model depth and other hyper-params, on up to 8 datasets, comparing against 6 baselines. The results look promising and convincing."

If this purely represents the angle between edges, pls make this definition more clear and draw connections with $t_{ijk}$ from Fig. 1.\n2. In section 3.2, I understand the motivations of adding positional encoding. But I hope authors can give more insights on why multiple encodings need to be used? What if you only choose 1 or 2? Some ablation studies on this point would be helpful.\n3. There are many existing works on crystal materials property predictions. For example, [1, 2] uses GNN and contrastive learning to predict density of states, and [2] uses prototypical classifiers to analyze crystal structures. These works are worth discussing in the related work.\n4. To facilitate understanding, it would be better if you can use a running example (e.g., one simple crystal structure) like Fig 2 to explain how each module and inputs/outputs are hooked.\n\n[1] Bai, J., et al. \"Xtal2DoS: Attention-based Crystal to Sequence Learning for Density of States Prediction.\" NeurIPS 2022 AI for Science: Progress and Promises. 2022.\n\n[2] Kong, S., et al. 2022.

For GwT, it seems that only the neighboring edges are added through $e_{ij}$, why it can capture long-range interactions? Do you expect that when N grows larger, it keeps drawing information from more distant neighbors?\n3. How is the speed when training such a model? Are all the sub-modules trained together? Is there any speed analysis?\n4. I didn't see $t_{ijk}$ in Fig 4. Is it used in encoding?\n5. For edge-engaged transformer graph convolution, does it involve any convolution operations in Fig. 4 (a)?"
