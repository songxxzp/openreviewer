                "value": "The authors propose a technique for pruning (sparsification) of neural networks that relies on robust estimation of the empirical Fisher Information Matrix as a surrogate for the Hessian of the training loss.  Earlier work has relied on a decomposition of the FIM to motivate a sparse LR formulation of an MIQP framework. \n\nIn contrast, in this work the authors propose a framework to address instances of contaminated gradients. In this situation, one must leverage robust estimators of the FIM, or risk a significant drop in empirical performance. By studying the original MIQP problem from the perspective of entropic Wasserstein regression, the authors propose a variation of the sparse LR formulation which amounts to substituting the 2-Wasserstein distance with entropic regularization for the quadratic regression loss. Notably, without entropic regularization, the formulation is equivalent to that of the sparse LR framework. \n\nTheoretically, the authors demonstrate that pruning via entropic Wasserstein regression exactly corresponds to gradient averaging using Neighborhood Interpolation, with the entropic regularization term governing the size of the neighborhood. Algorithmically, the method is simple and computationally efficient. Finding solutions to the problem is done via coupling sinkhorn iterations with SGD. Numerically, the performance of the method exceeds that of previous work and is competitive with the state of the art. \n\nThe method is simple and implies an elegant interpretation, as explored by the authors. Numerically, improvements over existing methods are observed- particularly when the training gradients are corrupted by noise. However, there is a significant number of grammatical mistakes and instances of poor phrasing. I do recommend this paper for acceptance, but suggest that the authors devote more time to proofreading the manuscript."
