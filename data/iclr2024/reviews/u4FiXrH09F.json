I assume that the cyclic property is added to obtain the implicit representation of graphs, but the datasets used in the experiments do not have the cyclic property.\n    - Moreover, I doubt that the performance of the synthetic experiments comes from the implicit representation. Since the representation at time step $T$ is directly related to the representation at time step $1$, through the learning (back-propagation) process, the model can directly utilize the information at time step $1$ to infer the class label at time step $T$. Hence, it is unclear whether the long-range dependency is captured correctly or not.\n- The main theorem seems a direct consequence of Gu et al. (2020).\n- The claimed 1600x speed-up seems like an overstatement. Although the proposed algorithm achieves a 1600x speed-up for the Brain10 dataset, the improvement is much lower for the other datasets. Having said that, I found that the improvement from the other datasets is not insignificant (10x improvement is also great).\n    - Moreover, it would be much more meaningful if there were any analysis on why the algorithm performs well on the Brain10 dataset. What characteristics of the dataset lead to such an impressive performance increase?\n- The representation of the manuscript can be improved further. Several notations are confusing, and a few terms are explained without having proper definitions. Here, I list some of them.\n    - The notation $t$ is used for the depth of a layer and the time stamp of a graph (e.g., the first paragraphs of section 3). Although one may infer which t corresponds to which (based on location - superscript for layer and subscript for timestamp), it is difficult to follow the manuscript.\n    - Transpose is denoted with superscript $T$, which is confusing with the timestamp T. Using \\top latex command can alleviate the confusion.\n    - Omega is not defined (Page 3, third line). I guess it means V\n    - \\ell in the equation on page 6 (where \\nabla L(\\omega) is defined) is not defined. So, I couldn\u2019t follow the details after equation 8.\n    - Please add references for datasets.\n    - Use proper command for the citations. Use latex commands \\citet and \\citep for this.\n    - Typo in the first sentence on Page 3 (l and d are both used to denote the dimension of the node attributes).\n    - Typo in the matrix in Theorem 1 (the right-most column needs to be removed)"

Additionally, Eq (8) suggests that the new constraint is only about the last timestamp. In this case, is it necessary to have Lemma 2 to arrive at Eq (8)? Why cannot directly iterate Eq (5) to have $\\phi(z, W, V; G_i)$. I would like to see more explanations regarding these. \n2. The literature review may not be sufficient. As the paper focuses on implicit GNNs, I think the author may want to introduce and briefly discuss a few more recent implicit GNN works (e.g., CGS [1], EIGNN [2], USP [3]). Especially, USP seems to have a similar bilevel optimization problem, though it focuses on static graphs. \n3. The descriptions for the experiments are not very clear. As mentioned in Table 3, the memory usage and the runtime are reported as per batch. But how batches are formed for a single graph? Randomly select some nodes or use some sampling methods (e.g., neighbor sampling)? \n\nOverall, I think it's an interesting submission.

They empirically work well. \n2. Could you explain more about Hassian-vector Product as mentioned in the last paragraph of Sec 4? Can it be directly handled by a modern autodiff package?

(8) utilizes multi-block bilevel optimization for solving, and when solving (8), the paper makes extensive use of approximations without explaining their validity or drawbacks.
