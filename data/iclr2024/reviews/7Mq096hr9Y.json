The primary focus remains on accuracy, which as already been extensively studied in the papers associated with each individual method. This limits the paper's potential to offer a fresh perspective on the methods by not exploring alternative criteria beyond accuracy, especially as other evaluation metrics are already described as available in the benchmark. \n\n### Remarks:\n\n- The color gradient in the plots make it difficult to really differentiate two methods.\n- The double-blind nature of the review is broken by keeping the name of the contributors and authors of the associated arxiv paper in the code provided as supplementary material ..."
