Would you mind clarifying how exactly to construct the router input?\n  - Also how to get the question embedding? Do you utilize other embedding model or just do that on-the-fly?\n\n- About the MoE deployment:\n  - Do you adopt LoRA-MoE in each Transformer block?\n  - Do you adopt LoRA only for the MLP, similarly with the original MoE?\n- About zero-shot evaluation:\n  - According to Sec. 4.1, the zero-shot evaluation conducted in this paper is only about zero-shot evaluation on novel datasets of the training tasks (e.g., ScienceQA for evaluation and VQA for training).\n  - Therefore, I wonder how it works if you have not seen any QA tasks during training, since it is difficult to understand a specialized architecture like MoE can generalize well to totally unseen tasks during pre-training.\n  - Moreover, if you still train with VQA, but change the prompt template of ScienceQA during testing, will the MoE router be robust to this kind of OoD generalization?\n- Overall, I think this is an interesting paper, but still with some problems to convince me about the effectiveness of the proposed method. I would consider increasing the score if my questions are well addressed."

Do you use loading balancing afterwards?
