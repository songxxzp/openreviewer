                "value": "Related Work/Dynamical Systems Theory:\n\nOne of my main concerns is that there is little reference to the rich mathematical body of work in dynamical systems theory anywhere in the paper. The concept of \"dynamical equivalence\" proposed in the supplement is well known in the literature (see e.g. Kutznetsov, \"Elements of Applied Bifurcation Theory), as are the proofs given in 6.1. in the context of the concepts of topological conjugacy&topological equivalence. However, both terms are only mentioned once in passing in the whole paper, and as far as I could see are not referenced anywhere. The term \"topological invariants\", while used in the abstract and title, is also never formally introduced nor explained in the rest of the paper.\n\nMy second main concern is that I don't understand your reasoning why you \"evaluate as baselines existing vector field representations, none of which explicitly encourage topological invariance\". Topological features (such as fixed points, cycles, stability of fixed points etc.) can also be numerically approximated directly from the flow fields, especially for simple 2-D models you investigate here where the vector field is already present (i.e. fixed points are simply locations where the flow field is zero). There are other topological properties (e.g. persistent homologies, Betti numbers) that one could also extract to aid with classification.  At least using this as a baseline for comparison would seem crucial in the context of this paper? If I'm not completely mistaken this should at least work better than random guessing, as the comparison methods on the Selkov model effectively do. Fitting polynomial/other representations to the vector fields that a priori are not tailored to extract a useful representation for topological invariants seems perhaps unsurprisingly not so effective?\nIt could also be interesting in this context to investigate to what extent what your model extracts can be intepreted, and how it relates to other topological invariants.\n\nRestriction to 2D\n\nThe restriction of all experiments to 2-D is also quite limiting. The authors indeed mention \"technical challenges\" in their conclusion for extensions to higher dimensions, but there are deeper theoretical reasons for these challenges, e.g. the lack of structural stability in higher dimensions, and more generally the scaling of your approach with the dimensionality of the dynamical system. Since this is a substantial limiting factor for extending your method to experimental settings, this could be made more explicit in the discussion.\n\n\nIn summary, in case I did not fundamentally misunderstand something about your approach and the general problem setting, it is unclear to me why you would need such a sophisticated machine learning architecture to extract features that can in the situation you investigate could be estimated from the flow directly? Since this is a crucial point to my mind point I am voting for rejection at this point, but am willing to adjust my score if these concerns are adressed."
