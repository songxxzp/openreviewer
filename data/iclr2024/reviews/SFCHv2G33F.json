                "value": "(1) First and foremost, the novelty is quite limited. As a reviewer of ICLR, one of the top AI conferences, I expect to see great contributions to the deep learning community. However, the PLM algorithms including ESM-2, AnKh, ProtBert, and others are very mature techniques. The multi-task training with a secondary structure prediction is kind of interesting but still trivial. The author ought to provide more discussion and deeper insight regarding the benefit of this multi-task scheme in the main text. To summarize, the author just examine an existing methodology (i.e., PLMs) on some publicly available datasets (PDBBind + ESM-2 SSP) with a straightforward training paradigm (fixed embedding and [CLS] for prediction). \n\n(2) It really confused me that whether the author aims to predict ligand-specific or ligand-free pockets. To be explicit, can different small molecules bind to different pockets in the same protein? If so, should we predict pocket based on the information of ligand rather than solely on the receptor? If not, that is, all molecules bind in the same position of the protein. The author still needs to union the positions to obtain the final pocket. However, the approach did not utilize any ligand representations. \n\n(3) PLMs have shown promise in solving biological problems. However, it utilizes no structural information. Since we do have structural data in PDBBind, it really cannot convince me that PLMs are the best solution to predict cryptic pockets. (i) Please examine and compare more baselines (I am not familar with this specific task, and the references listed may be wrong) [A][B]. (ii) Machine-learning-based docking method can be also transferred to predict the pocket, such as EquiBind, and DiffDock. Please examine them. (iii) Please equip geometric networks (e.g., PocketMiner) with PLMs and verify the performance. See [C] for more details. I suppose PLMs + geometric models should outperform PLMs. \n\n[A] Accelerating Cryptic Pocket Discovery Using AlphaFold. \n\n[B] Graph Attention Site Prediction (GrASP): Identifying Druggable Binding Sites Using Graph Neural Networks with Attention\n\n[C] Integration of pre-trained protein language models into geometric deep learning networks\n\n\n(4) As a machine learning paper, it is very necessary to offer adequate experimental details for readers to reproduce the results (at least in the Appendix). For instance, how many computational resources (e.g., GPUs) have been used in the training? What is the optimizer type and how high is the learning rate? \n\n(5) I believe it is better to clearly explain the types of PLMs that are used in the evaluation (at least in the Appendix). For instance, Ankh is new to me, and I have to search for details of this model myself. Besides, ESM-2 has no reference when the first time it appears.  \n\n(6) Make sure words are spelled correctly. For example, on Page 9 'PBDbind' should be 'PDBbind'."

                "value": "(1) In Section 5.2, the author uses the average embedding as a pseudo-[CLS] token for ProtT5-XL. However, in the official document of ESM-2, it is also recommended to use the average embedding as the representation of the entire protein. Have the author tried this style for training?\n\n(2) A minor point is that the authors adopt an unusual arrangement to organize the sections, which accords with the template of Spring Nature Journals. From my humble point of view, a standard format of AI conference is to put the method section before the result and conclusion sections."

Optionally, a multi-task setting is also considered, where the secondary structure of the protein is also predicted using the PLM embeddings. Several popular PLMs and prediction heads are evaluated, and it is shown that with the right combination of PLM and prediction head, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PocketMiner baseline in cryptic pocket prediction performance."

Given the knowledge that cryptic pockets tend to have local structures, could such prior knowledge be injected into the prediction model, for example, as a regularizer (where local positive predictions are encouraged during model training, while negative ones are discouraged)?\n\n- Could you please provide more details on the secondary structure prediction (SSP) task? How many classes is this task composed of? Is there a separate prediction head for structure prediction on top of the cryptic pocket prediction head? Why and how is its weight in the objective function chosen to be 1?\n\n- In Section 5.3, it is mentioned that the results are reported for the *best* model from 7 trials. I was expecting that for each specific configuration (i.e., PLM/head/task), the *average* performance (and its *standard deviation*) across the seven random trials would get reported, not the *maximum* performance.\n\n- The number of parameters for ESP in Table 7, especially with the MLP 1024 and MHA heads, is orders of magnitude larger than the number of parameters of PocketMiner. This is not even taking into account the number of PLM parameters (which are taken to be frozen in this paper). How does ESP perform compared to PocketMiner for a comparable number of parameters?\n\n- I may have missed these, but there are certain acronyms in the manuscript that are not defined anywhere in the paper (such as AUC, APS, LR, CLS).
