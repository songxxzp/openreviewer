However, I do not find the actual loss functions as well as the model in the text. \n5. In algorithm 2, the definition of various models, such as G_\u03b8 is not defined in the paper. The whole methodology section is hard to follow since it misses some important information.\n6. The proposed approach relies on class and task information, which can not be used in a more realistic continual learning setting such as unsupervised learning.\n7. Why use the conditional GAN instead of other models such as WGAN?\n8. In theorem 1, some notations are not defined or explained. For example, what is \"\n\"trace\" in Eq.1. What is $|| ||_F$ in Eq.1?\n9. To avoid forgetting, this work employs the generative replay mechanism, which has been done in a wide range of works.\n10. The whole algorithm 1 is unclear to me because a lot of definitions are not explained. For example, $S$ in algorithm 1 is not described in the text. \n11. The main objective function and the models are not defined and described in the text, which makes it difficult for the readers to understand the main contribution.\n\nOverall, this paper is hard to follow because a lot of notations are not described clearly.

The need for continual learning for generative models and their own challenges beyond conventional continual learning scenarios and challenges are not well discussed, and this makes the reader feel that this work is a simple incremental work by transferring conditional generative adversarial networks on continual learning setting with simple repeats the well-known challenges - catastrophic forgetting - again.\n\n- Limited investigation of 'modes'. The paper only assumes a mode is a class. However, this seems not realistic and outdated since recent generative models already have a surprising generalization and zero-shot ability on various styles/classes in a single model. Simple incremental learning in each 'class' means nothing these days.\n\n- Similarly, tasks are too simple. Evaluation with MNIST/CIFAR and Flower dataset is a bit far from the recent generative model and/or continual learning trends. I recommend ImageNet/Coco + a, which can be better candidates. Additionally, baselines are also too old (most of them were published around three to four years ago). When we consider this venue for 2024, it is hard to confirm that the proposed idea and baselines are sufficiently strong compared to its counterparts/alternatives.\n\n- No empirical comparison of the proposed metric. I fail to find the merits of the suggested score metric compared to other possible approaches to select similar source classes/modes with the target one, including FiD or other various types of metrics such as mutual information / KL or JS divergence metrics on their embeddings, etc. There are tons of techniques to meet the same purpose, but no comparison or demonstration to show the impact/strengths of the suggested score is provided."
