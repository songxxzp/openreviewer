Tweedie's formula explicitly relates the first posterior moment to the score of the data.  Similar relations hold for higher order momements of the posterior and higher order scores.  These expressions are presented in Theorem 1 and 2, which are proved in the appendices.  For high dimensional problems (e.g. imaging), computing these terms directly is not computationally feasible.  Instead the top eigenvectors are computed by the subspace iteration method.  These eigenvectors are then used to visualize the main modes of variation in the posterior.  The method requires only a pre-training denoiser and forward evaluations of the denoiser, avoiding any need for additional training.  It is fast and memory efficient and so suitable for high-resolution images."

However, for the experiments performed on natural images (e.g. Fig. 5), it is difficult to distinguish much variation in the images.  I had to really zoom into these images to see the changes that are highlighed by the annotated arrows.  However, I suppose the eigenvectors themselves may be a more useful visualization aid since it is more clear what structure of the image changes.  Nevertheless, the difficulting in distringuishing changes in the modified images may limit the practical application of the method proposed."
