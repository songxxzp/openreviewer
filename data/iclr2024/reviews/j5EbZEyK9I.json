                "value": "I see a notable weakness of this work in the novelty and the contribution. The paper seems to state claims that are more-or-less known in research community. So, even if there are no publications on the topic, e.g., the fact of having shift of distributions (and thus, lower performance) in the case you sample not from the target distribution is common knowledge and directly follows from ML grounds. So, such knowledges are also referred to as folklore. So, in my opinion, the paper contribution is narrowing down to experimental analysis, which is good but looks like an observational study without clear new insights (besides the ones expected by folklore knowledge). It is not enough for this venue. I would assume that such an analysis is a good illustration / help for students that study ML / statistics and might be published through some books on the topic.\n\n\nAnother related weakness is the problem setup. The authors try to explore some effects when sampling not from the underlying distribution D in different ways knowing that they sample with shifts. What is the problem to be solved? If the practitioner face a situation, knowing D, then they will sample from it. If they have no access to D, then they try to sample some distribution such that it is most close to D. If they face two sources and expect that they have representation of D (they believe that their union is close to D), then they will sample randomly from the union. And etc. In any way, the practitioner knowing basics of ML, will attempt to be close to the best knowledge of D for them. It is hard for me to imagine situations described in the work, where a practitioner is aware of ML grounds and is increasing samples without carrying about the general population. I assume, it might be the case when this practitioner is working with ML tools without knowing ML grounds (so, in this case, a book on ML grounds might help). Overall, the work lack of clear problem statement: what is known for a practitioner, what is not, which decisions they can take, what are limitations. \n\n\nSec.3.1 serves for me as support of absence of clear problem statement in the work. The authors write \u201cWhile in reality the test set cannot be accessed, we assume we can use some part of the training set (e.g., the D_s_1 ) that is similar to the test distribution).\u201d Seems that it means that the practitioner believes that D_s_1 IS the distribution D. So, when receiving D_s_2 they should take D_s_1 united with D_s_2 as D, or not considering D_s_2 at all."

                "value": "In my opinion, there are multiple issues with the work originating from the simplicity of the findings, mismatch in motivation/setting, and a lack of consistent evaluation throughout. I provide more details on these below, but due to these reasons I am leaning towards rejection as I believe the paper does not meet the bar for acceptance at ICLR:\n\n- **Simple Empirical Findings and Lack of Generalizability**: The experiments conducted as well as the results obtained are quite simple. Both the Sequential and Mixture model settings are quite trivial, and the obtained results are unsurprising to me. For instance, it seems intuitive that multi-source dataset scaling could lead to worse outcomes on a reference test set, and that it might lead to better generalization (Section 5). The only results that look at data scaling more deeply are located within Section 5.1, but still by themselves those cannot motivate this work. Furthermore, the results obtained (as well as the approach undertaken) are highly dataset dependent (for e.g., what if I sample the reference test set differently for Folktables? Or use a different state altogether?) This issue is also showcased via the accuracy results for both the Yelp and MIMIC-IV datasets under the Sequential paradigm (refer to Figure 6a and Figure 7a, respectively). These figures (for obvious reasons) show very different trends across both datasets for the same model.\n- **Inconsistent Evaluation Across Datasets**: The experiments are mostly conducted on the Folktables dataset, with a few results for Yelp and MIMIC-IV. For consistency in evaluation, all the datasets should be used and conclusions can be drawn from the results more adequately. For instance, all the results for Section 5.1 (such as those on the generalized test set) consider only the Folktables dataset, and Yelp and MIMIC-IV are not considered. Furthermore, it is not always mentioned in the text when the other datasets are being used and what the motivation is to discard others, which can be confusing for readers.\n- **Limited Scope and Applicability**: The biggest drawback of the work is the mismatch in whether this work tackles a useful practical problem and its actual motivation. The original outlined motivations in the abstract and introduction imply that the paper will aim to provide more insights on data scaling in useful practical scenarios. However, the work only considers tabular data and very simple models (the most complex is the MLP). The focus on tabular datasets significantly narrows the paper's scope, especially considering that data scaling is a critical concern in large language models (LLMs) and other domains outside of tabular data (such as NLP and Vision). The paper fails to provide insights or implications for these broader and arguably more impactful areas (such as deep learning), limiting its relevance, scope and applicability. In its current form, I do not think the paper provides insights that are useful for a real-world practical application scenario."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Could the authors provide an appropriate justification or real-world scenario as an example for concentrating exclusively on tabular datasets? In this scenario, if models are not deep learning based would they be prone to large data scaling issues?\n- In this simpler paradigm with models such as Logistic Regression etc, instead of continuously adding more data for generalizability, would it not make sense to just focus on approaches that curb distribution shift and retrain the model cyclically over certain time periods? \n- Please feel free to respond to any of the other weaknesses listed above."

The target set should be a sample from all n datasets, unless it is updated each time a new dataset is added.\nIt is also not clear how long the model is re-trained with the new examples. This can help us better understand if the examples can\u2019t be learned or if the model just did not have as many iterations to incorporate these new examples. \nThe implications of this work are not clear. In real-world settings, if there exists a datasets similar to one that we currently have but has high divergence does it mean it should not be included in the analysis? Doesn\u2019t not doing so restrict the model from better generalising? Eg. Yelp reviews in MN vs SD.\nThirdly, it looks like adding more data reduces performance disparity between groups and in general helps the least performing group. Reducing disparity is perhaps indicating that the model is generalising better and getting more robust and these should be good things."

We encourage you to reframe the sentence stating such an evaluation as a best (and often forgotten) practice.\n2. *Criteria for rejecting more data*: The problem posed by the authors resembles active learning and some specific data-based strategies. Furthermore, some research has been performed on active learning and stopping criteria. The authors may be interested in researching these areas.

Nevertheless, the authors should consider enriching them with some scenarios where domain adaptation is used to mitigate distribution differences. The authors may be interested in the following work: Farahani, Abolfazl, et al. \"A brief review of domain adaptation.\" Advances in data science and information engineering: proceedings from ICDATA 2020 and IKE 2020 (2021): 877-894.\n4. *Results and analysis*: Do the authors venture some hypothesis as to why the XGB model is robust to data from different distributions, suffering a lower accuracy loss?"
