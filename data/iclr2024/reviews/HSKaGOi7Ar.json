In efforts to address limitations of the WL framework, the current paper advocates quantifying GNN expressivity through *homomorphism expressivity* \u2014 their ability to count graph substructures under homomorphism. The main theoretical contribution is a characterization of homomorphism expressivity for popular classes of GNNs in the context of graph, node, and edge representation. Among others, this allows a more fine-grained comparison between architectures, resolving several open questions. Experiments on synthetic and a couple of real-world tasks corroborate the theory, showing that the performance of GNNs aligns with the proposed expressivity measure."

In particular, equivalence to WL tests can be too coarse of a measure and proving that one architecture is superior to another is often based on individual exemplar graphs. In contrast, for several GNN architectures, the current paper completely characterizes the graph homomorphisms they can count, facilitating a more fine-grained comparison and analyzing their subgraph counting ability.\n\n2. In general, the paper is well-written. The motivation and main results are clearly described, along with discussions on relevant literature and technical details. Though the paper is a bit dense. I would suggest allocating more space for providing examples and intuitions as to which types of graphs are included in the characterizations of Theorem 3.3 that are based on nested ear decompositions (NEDs). In my opinion, this can come at the expense of the extensions in Subsections 3.3 and 3.4, which can be deferred to an appendix.\n\n3. The theoretical analysis establishes elegant connections to concepts from graph theory, e.g. nested ear decompositions, which may prove useful for future work.\n\nI believe the technical contributions pose a promising step forward in formalizing the expressive power of GNNs, and therefore recommend acceptance. Yet, there are a few weaknesses (listed below). Most importantly, a technical issue with the definition of homomorphism expressivity that requires clarification."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. There seems to be a technical issue with the definition of homomorphism expressivity (Definition 3.1). I believe it can be solved, but requires addressing or further clarification. Specifically, $\\mathcal{F}^M$ is not necessarily defined for all models $M$ since it does not take into account graphs $F$ for which there exist graphs $G$ and $H$ with equal homomorphism counts with respect to $F$ but different representations according to $M$. Homomorphism expressivity of $M$ is defined only if no such $F$ exists since it cannot be within $\\mathcal{F}^M$ and also cannot be outside $\\mathcal{F}^M$. For example, homomorphism expressivity is not defined for a universal architecture as it can assign different representations to any two non-isomorphic graphs.\n    1. Is it the case that for the GNNs considered $\\mathcal{F}^M$ is always well-defined? This seems to be indicated by Theorem 3.3 and the subsequent discussion, however, it is not clear enough. I strongly recommend elaborating upon this point near the definition to avoid confusion.\n\n    2. Homomorphism expressivity is referred throughout as a \u201ccomplete\u201d measure. Given that it is not defined for all architectures $M$, I believe this terminology can be misleading.\n\n2. Homomorphism expressivity suffers from a limitation that also exists in the WL framework: it disregards features of vertices/edges. The proposed expressivity measure takes into account only the ability to capture graph structures, assuming each vertex is associated with a unique discrete label. While identifying graph structure is indeed important, in many cases the features of vertices play an equal, if not more important role (see, e.g., [1]). I do not believe this significantly harms the quality of the current paper, and is perhaps a consideration for future work, but to me referring to homomorphism expressivity as a \u201ccomplete\u201d measure may require some hedging.\n\n[1] Liu, Renming, et al. \"Towards a Taxonomy of Graph Learning Datasets.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14809 (2021)."

Does this allow taking into account all possible models or is it incompatible with the results in the paper?\n\nAn additional (more minor) comment. In the paragraph at the bottom of page 5 it is stated:\n\n> \u201cFirst, we highlight a key insight that homomorphism can serve as a fundamental\nexpressivity measure, which is achieved by further proving a non-trivial result that FM is maximal\n(Definition 3.1(b)).\u201d\n\nBy definition $\\mathcal{F}^M$ is maximal, hence, it is not clear the intention of this sentence is. Was it that the existence of a maximal $\\mathcal{F}^M$ is proven?"

I am wondering could the proposed framework be used to analyze other variants and reveal the same result as discussed in [1].\n\n2. Can the proposed framework also be used to analyze other more general GNN frameworks like [2] or [3]? \n\n3. The subgraph counting power is proved for only moderate graph size (nodes size $\\leq$ 6 or edge size $\\leq$ 8). I am wondering, what is the major gap or obstacle for proving a more general graph size? I am guessing it is related to the equation stated in the paper that characterizes the quantitative relationship between homomorphism count and subgraph count. For graphs of general size, is the proposed theorem at least an essential condition for successful counting?\n\nFor the broader impact:\n1. So far, the paper only discusses the analysis result of the proposed framework on some existing GNN variants. I am wondering if the authors could discuss how the proposed framework can be used to analyze new GNN variants when it is proposed or how could other researchers design new powerful and efficient GNN variants based on this analysis framework.\n\n\nI understand some questions may not be easy to answer and the answer will not negatively affect my score.

                "value": "This is a well-written, interesting theoretical work on GNNs expressivity. I have a few questions:\n\n- Why are homomorphism numbers important to us? Are there any concrete applications (e.g., in biology, etc.) that they appear? I know that subgraph counts are definitely important (from molecular biology), but not sure about homomorphisms. I'm asking because the main point of characterizing the power of GNNs is to have a better understanding for practical purposes.\n\n\n- Under what conditions can the models in this paper express all subgraph counts of a  particular size (say less than k)? Indeed, how do you compare your method for counting with the other methods, like equivariant polynomials for GNNs and also recursive-based methods (like RNP-GNNs)? Is there a way to understand how recursion in RNP-GNNs can help counting all subgraphs using your theory (i.e., NEDs, etc.) and if there is any connections? I suggest discussing it a bit in the paper because recursion is a popular way to boost GNNs, and it's not clear if NEDs somewhere appear there or not.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------\nAfter the rebuttal: I appreciate the authors for their response and revision. As they fully addressed my questions/comments, and they added new stuff to the manuscript which I believe improved the quality of the paper, I decided to increase my score."
