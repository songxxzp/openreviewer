                "value": "This paper studied two challenges of training offline reinforcement learning models with visual inputs: 1) overfitting in representation learning and 2) overestimation issue. The basic idea is to harness a readily available RL simulator such that the offline agent can interact with it while the offline RL can be treated as an online-to-offline transfer learning problem. The interaction with the auxiliary RL agent allows the offline agent to assess the target policy by introducing a  regularization term in the training. Meanwhile, the online interaction is also designed to facilitate the learning of more generalized representations from the visual input. Experimental results presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, comparing with the models such as CQL and offline DV2 in six robot manipulation tasks."

A method for doing well in this new problem statement\n\nCurrently in the paper 1 and 2 are both presented as a method. I think it would be more straightforward and fair to separate these contributions. \n\nThis is important because only one baseline is fine-tuned from the source online simulator to the offline data. However, based on prior work on off-line to online fine-tuning, I would expect different RL baselines to have different levels of success when provided access to a online training in a source environment. For example, the IQL [Kostrikov et. al., 2021] paper shows that different offline RL algorithms perform differently when fine-tuned online. I think to have proper baselines, all methods should be able to access the online simulator. It is also important to add baselines that focus specifically on the offline to online problem statement (namely, IQL).\n\n- Kostrikov et. al.

On one hand, as discussed in part 4.2, the success of this online-to-offline paradigm highly hinges on the similarity between the source and target domains. On the other hand, offline RL research is motivated by the assumption that online data collection can be too costly or dangerous on the target domain. These two conditions seem contradictory since if we cannot query large amount of online data from a target domain due to safety or economic issues, it's unlikely that we can build a high-quality simulator on a very similar source domain.\n\n2. **Marginal or unclear performance improvement of the method**.  The paper compares CoWorld with a number of offline RL methods trained **on the target domain only** with only one exception, which is a simple transfer learning strategy which finetunes the source model on the target domain. I find the performance improvement of CoWorld not convincing enough due to the following considerations:\n\n-  There are many potentially better baseline methods that can leverage data from both domains, which the paper doesn't compare. To name a few: finetuning the model with early stopping/soft update/elastic weight consolidation [1], or finetuning the model and source agent simultaneously, or simply co-training a policy on both domains simultaneously.\n\n- The performance of CoWorld seems to be highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as the Target-inclined reward factor $k$. According to Figure 11, by simply changing $k=0.3$ to $k=0.7$ results in about 600 decline to ~3000 in episode return. In this case, CoWorld is inferior to both Finetune and Offline DV2 on DC $\\rightarrow$ BP task according to Table 1. The improvement in Figure 9 also looks very marginal compared to the naive Finetune baseline.\n \n3. **Computational complexity**: As highlighted in section 6, CoWorld achieves a marginal improvement at the cost of increase computational complexity, which is a notable limitation.\n\nMinor issues:\n\n1. The paper seems rushed. What follows requires further clarification:\n\n- In figure 4, what are the source and target domains for (a) and (b)? Why do you conclude that \"performance experiences a notable decline in scenarios involving a significant data distribution shift between the source and the target domains, such as in the following cross-environment experiments from Meta-World to RoboDesk\"?\n\n[1] Kirkpatrick, James, et al. \"Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks.\" Proceedings of the national academy of sciences 114.13 (2017): 3521-3526."

                "value": "The authors introduce Collaborative World Models (CoWorld), a method for offline reinforcement learning (RL) that conceptualizes the challenge as an online-to-offline transfer learning problem. CoWorld aims to reduce the representation learning issue of overfitting that emerges from using limited visual data and mitigate the common tendency of value function overestimation in offline RL.\n\nThe method utilizes an auxiliary online simulator and learns separate source and target world models and source and target actor-critic agents, each with its own policy and value function. Regularization of the target agent value function is designed to prevent over-estimation without being overly conservative. They tackle the representation overfitting problem by aligning the target and source model's latent spaces. CoWorld iteratively performs a three-stage learning procedure: aligning the latent spaces between source and target world models, target-inclined source model tuning, and behavior learning with min-max value regularization."

                "value": "- *Strategic Integration of Transfer Learning*: The authors utilize an online simulator to serve as a 'test-bed\" and gather more data from an analogous task. This parallels multi-task and meta-learning approaches that rely on transfer learning across tasks. \n\n- *Empirical Validation*: Experimental results show that the method works well. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple pretraining with fine-tuning baseline, which suggests that transfer between tasks is crucial. \n\n- *Cohesive Methodological Design*: The components of CoWorld contribute synergistically to the overall performance enhancement, as validated by ablation studies."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- *Dependence on Auxiliary Simulators:* The CoWorld framework's performance is critically dependent on the availability of an online simulator in a domain that is sufficiently similar to the target domain. This reliance may limit the method's applicability in situations where such simulators are unavailable or where the source and target domains do not share sufficient similarity to ensure sufficient knowledge transfer.\n\n- *Decoupling Rationale*: While it is easy to understand how getting more data from an online simulator in the source domain is beneficial, the rationale behind the decision to maintain two separate world models (rather than a single, jointly trained model on both offline and online data) is not sufficiently explained or supported by evidence."
