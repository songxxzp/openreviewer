                "value": "To address the potential copyright infringement caused by Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs), especially the unauthorized imitation of styles and appearances of the products from artists and fashion companies, the authors propose a novel watermarking technique called DiffusionShield. This model embeds secret messages into protected images in an imperceptible manner, ensuring that these watermarks are easily learned by GDMs and will be reproduced in other generated images. Existing watermarking techniques were not specifically designed for GDMs, making them either hard for GDMs to learn or requiring larger perturbations to maintain partial watermarks. In contrast, the authors develop a new watermarking technique tailored for GDMs, based on the finding that GDMs more easily learn watermarks with high pattern uniformity and theoretical prove that uniform patterns are prioritized in learning over the original images. To capitalize on this pattern uniformity, DiffusionShield introduces a blockwise strategy and a joint optimization method that not only further enhance detection accuracy but also reduce the budget. Finally, the authors validate their model\u2019s superiority over existing methods in terms of visual quality and detection accuracy through various experiments, and demonstrating its effectiveness in both single-user and multi-user scenarios."

The article organizes the problem statement in a clear manner, offering a comprehensive discussion on protection scenarios, including both single-owner and multiple-owner cases.\n2. The authors properly define \"pattern uniformity\"(Equation 1) and provide related theoretical explanation. They further conduct experiments to substantiate the significance of this concept.\n3. The experiments are extensive, examining the influence of different Perturbation Budgets, Message Lengths, and Watermark Rates on bit accuracy. Additionally, in a multiple-owner scenario, the paper discusses the impact of multiple users on bit accuracy.\n4. The performance is good. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art bit accuracy and perturbation budget across multiple datasets and maintains superior robustness under various image distortions (except for gaussian noise)."

                "value": "1. The paper carries out extensive experiments but could improve in terms of layout. A considerable amount of experimental data is placed in the appendix, with minimal mention in the main text. As a potential user of this model, I would be particularly concerned about the issue of watermark rates. Specifically, it's worth questioning whether the proposed method remains effective when the training dataset contains only a limited number of watermarked images. Appendix F's Figure 11 briefly touches upon this issue, but this aspect should be more explicitly mentioned in the main text.\n\n2. The paper employs the HiDDeN model for deep learning-based watermarking, which is no longer state-of-the-art (SOTA). Nevertheless, HiDDeN outperforms the proposed method in certain experiments, such as under the 'Uncond.' condition in Table 1 for CIFAR10 and in the  distortion method of Gaussian noise in Table 4. Therefore, the authors should utilize a state-of-the-art deep learning-based watermarking model to further substantiate the superiority of their method.\n\n3. In the Implementation Details section, the authors build training dataset by \"designating one random class of images as watermarked images, while treating other classes as unprotected images.\" While using images from the same class might be an ideal and simpler scenario that could further promote pattern uniformity, in real-world applications, images could come from various classes. The authors need to elaborate more on the effectiveness of their method under such circumstances."

However, I would still suggest at least mentioning the experiment of watermark rates in the main body of the paper. This is merely a suggestion on my part; even if the authors choose not to adopt it, it won't lead me to lower my rating of the paper.\n\n2. The second point of weakness is a significant concern for me. I hope the authors can provide direct experiments to alleviate my doubts. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) model that I'm currently aware of is \"Towards Blind Watermarking: Combining Invertible and Non-invertible Mechanisms.\"\n\n3. For the third weakness, I believe the authors need to conduct more comprehensive experiments to further substantiate the effectiveness of their method across multiple real-world scenarios."

In the case of unconditional generation, no definitive ground truth criteria are established for identifying which generated samples should be considered as protected. Currently, the authors define these protected images as those filtered using a classifier, which we will refer to as C. This approach raises concerns as the authors have not sufficiently demonstrated the quality of classifier C, and it may not accurately gauge the impact of protected training data on image generation. A more effective approach to assigning ground truth labels to generated images might involve utilizing an influence function to quantify the influence of protected training data on image generation.\n\nIt is imperative to conduct an analysis of the method's false positive rate, specifically to determine if the method assigns high bit accuracy to samples that should not be considered as protected data. This assessment could be performed using metrics like AUROC.\n\nRegarding Table 4, the method exhibits a relatively low resistance to Gaussian noise. It is essential for the authors to specify the standard deviation (std) of the Gaussian noise applied in this context. Recent research has demonstrated the vulnerability of imperceptible watermarks to attacks involving significant Gaussian noise addition and subsequent denoising using diffusion models [1] [2]. Given that DiffusionShield relies on an imperceptible watermark, the authors should provide a thorough analysis of the watermark's robustness against such attacks, including assessments of bit accuracy and AUROC.\n\n\n\n[1] Robustness of AI-Image Detectors: Fundamental Limits and Practical Attacks.
