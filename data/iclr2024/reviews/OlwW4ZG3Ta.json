In addition, for the practical implementation of the proposed algorithm, the objective function based on PPO was proposed and the correlation between hyperparameters was explained.\n3) In the cliff walking environment, the proposed algorithm was experimentally shown to fall off the cliff less and reach the goal faster than the existing algorithms, which is consistent with the performance expected by the authors at the beginning of the paper. It also improved the average return and convergence speed compared to the existing algorithms in the mujoco environment, which is commonly tested in policy optimization."

                "value": "1) The theorems and proofs proposed in the paper are interesting, but the performance shown in the experiments does not seem to be much different from the performance of the baselines. In particular, there are many mentions of convergence speed, but the results shown do not show a significant improvement over existing methods. It is necessary to show the performance improvement in an environment where the subsequent state-action can be better considered.\n2) The clipping working environment that the authors consider seems a little less relevant to the general field of policy optimization. The proposed environment is more appropriate to be considered in a constrained reinforcement learning or safe reinforcement learning environment where dangerous situations should be avoided. Therefore, the comparison target and baseline algorithm should be the constrained reinforcement learning or safety reinforcement learning algorithm.\n3) In the introduction section of the paper, it is argued that existing policy optimization algorithms do not directly consider the impact of subsequent state-actions in the trajectories. Also, in the example, if the agent repeatedly visits the cliff state, it is dangerous because agent is likely to act to fall off the cliff. However, in policy optimization, since there is a discounted sum of reward term, it is possible to provide feedback on the cliff state and the falling action. Therefore, the motivation of the proposed method is difficult to understand, as it allows us to consider the impact of subsequent state action under the influence of rewards.\n4) The proposed algorithm increases the number of hyperparameters as the value of k increases. The authors claim that k=2,3 is suitable because of the stability of learning, but even with k=3, it requires 5 hyperparameters to adjust the clipping and learning rate. In addition, the experiments show the case of k=2, and the best performing hyperparameters are not consistent across experimental environments. Therefore, it can be said that the algorithm is sensitive to hyperparameters."

This would present a contradiction.\u201d **Optimizing this objective can result in a bit more complicated consequence than what\u2019s been stated here**: since the policy in both $r_0$ and $r_1$ is parameterized with a same set of parameters, optimizing the objective may increase the probability of $a_0$ and thus tip over the sign of $r_0-1$.  The problem is $a_0$ and $a_1$ are from the same parametrized policy. \n\n\nSecond, **the monotonic improvement statement of Theorem 4.1 can be erroneous**. Consider a special case of $k=1$, which yields the TRPO bound as suggested by the paper (assume this statement is correct), then the lower bound will be $\\alpha_0 \\hat{L}_0(\\pi, \\hat{\\pi}) - \\hat{C}_1(\\pi, \\hat{\\pi})$, \n\nwhich equals to $E_{s_0, a_0\\sim\\rho^{\\hat{\\pi}}} [r_0 A^{\\hat{\\pi}}(s_0, a_0)] - \\frac{\\gamma R_{max}}{(1-\\gamma)^3}||\\pi - \\hat{\\pi}||_1^2$.

                "value": "First, I do not understand why the authors believe proximal methods do not already account for the true gradient of the policy which also considers the contribution through the stationary distribution.  Indeed, in the original CPI paper \\citep{kakade}, the authors first derive the form of the bound that contains the stationary distribution with the current policy, and not a prior policy, then use a mixture policy to ensure that the new policy is \u201cclose\u201d to the prior one and justify replacing the current stationary distribution with the previous one. However, a lot of work has been done since, and it is known that proximal PG methods \\citep{bhandari21, shani2019, vaswani2021} (and algorithmic implementation \\citep{li2022analytical}, PPO, TRPO, MDPO \\citep{tomar2020}, MPO \\citet{abdolmaleki2018} etc.) are functional-gradient methods \\citep{vaswani2021}, in the sense that the lower bound the algorithms optimize are linearizations of the policy performance objective in the direct policy representation. The functional gradient is $d_{\\pi_t}^\\top Q_{\\pi_t}$. In that sense the stationary distribution that the algorithms use is w.r.t. (with respect to) the previous policy (see \\citet{bandhari2019, vaswani2021, sutton2000, agarwal2019}). As they follow the true policy gradient, these methods are convergent \\citep{bhandari21, vaswani2021, xiao2022, johnson2023}, at least their theoretical versions, under adaptive step sizes. The true policy gradient does take into account the gradient through the stationary distribution.\nI did not understand at all the examples they give, which seem to say that \u201c0\u201d has some special meaning when it comes to the reward. \n\nThe text is very unclear, vague, and grammatically incorrect, which makes it very difficult to follow the authors\u2019 arguments.\nIn the motivating introduction, the authors discuss multi-step methods, but this is completely out of context, and use words which have not been defined and are not scientifically rigorous, like \u201cwe give a nice theory.\u201d, \u201cthe policy can be reflective\u201d, \u201c this empowers the agent to engage in introspection and introduce modifications to its actions within the current state to a certain degree\u201d, \u201csome admirable algorithms\u201d, \u201cdirect optimization of this generalized surrogate objective function may have to be done very carefully\u201d, \u201cRPO efficiently utilizes \u2018good\u2019 experiences, makes adjustments based on \u2018bad\u2019 experiences\u2019\u201d\n\nWith respect to scientific correctness, at some point the authors completely remove a term from the bound saying that \u201cthis term \u201c1\u201d may adversely affect policy optimization. I did not understand that at all. The authors say \u201cfor $k = 1$, the $l_1$ norm constraints are replaced by KL constraints\u201d, but this to me makes no sense at all. \n\nThe notation is also confusing, as it seems the authors reuse \u201cr\u201d to represent the importance sampling ratio between the current policy and a prior one. It is unclear what \u201ck\u201d represents as it is not defined, just implied, and seems very important throughout the paper, with multiple reference and impacting the algorithms\u2019 empirical performance.\n\nThen, I also did not really understand the emphasis on the exploration-exploitation coupling on on-policy methods since the whole point of the paper is to improve off-policy methods like PPO and TRPO. These proximal methods are off-policy algorithms, which is the entire point of the efficiency of the methods, the fact that it can reuse prior experience (from the previous policy) multiple times to minimize the lower bound. Otherwise, on-policy policy gradient methods like \\citet{sutton2000} (or algorithmic implementations with parallel streams of experiences like A3C \\citep{mnih16}, Impala \\citep{espeholt18}) directly use the PGT \\citep{sutton2000} w.r.t the parameter vector and rebuild the linear lower bound at each time-step so they don\u2019t need a lower bound surrogate objective that is quasi-concave and can be optimized for multiple updates. \n\n\nThe authors claim the method maintains mototonic improvement, but it is known that proximal-gradient methods, with adaptive step size have this property \\citep{alfano2023, chen2022, xiao2022, johnson2023}, since they are functional-gradient methods, at least for tabular direct or softmax parametrizations.\n\n@misc{li2022analytical,\n      title={An Analytical Update Rule for General Policy Optimization}, \n      author={Hepeng Li and Nicholas Clavette and Haibo He},\n      year={2022},\n      eprint={2112.02045},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.AI}\n}\n\n@InProceedings{bhandari21,\n  title = \t { On the Linear Convergence of Policy Gradient Methods for Finite MDPs },\n  author =       {Bhandari, Jalaj and Russo, Daniel},\n  booktitle = \t {Proceedings of The 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics},\n  pages = \t {2386--2394},\n  year = \t {2021},\n  editor = \t {Banerjee, Arindam and Fukumizu, Kenji},\n  volume = \t {130},\n  series = \t {Proceedings of Machine Learning Research},\n  month = \t {13--15 Apr},\n  publisher =    {PMLR},\n  pdf = \t {http://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/bhandari21a/bhandari21a.pdf},\n  url = \t {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/bhandari21a.html},\n  abstract = \t { We revisit the finite time analysis of policy gradient methods in the one of the simplest settings: finite state and action MDPs with a policy class consisting of all stochastic policies and with exact gradient evaluations.

A key challenge is to handle the increased amount of data and extended training time. We have developed a new distributed agent IMPALA (Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture) that not only uses resources more efficiently in single-machine training but also scales to thousands of machines without sacrificing data efficiency or resource utilisation. We achieve stable learning at high throughput by combining decoupled acting and learning with a novel off-policy correction method called V-trace. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IMPALA for multi-task reinforcement learning on DMLab-30 (a set of 30 tasks from the DeepMind Lab environment (Beattie et al., 2016)) and Atari57 (all available Atari games in Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013a)). Our results show that IMPALA is able to achieve better performance than previous agents with less data, and crucially exhibits positive transfer between tasks as a result of its multi-task approach.}\n}\n\n@article{vaswani2021,\n  author       = {Sharan Vaswani and\n                  Olivier Bachem and\n                  Simone Totaro and\n                  Robert Mueller and\n                  Matthieu Geist and\n                  Marlos C.
