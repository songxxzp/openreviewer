More writing should be dedicated to describing how the metrics were actually computed (see Questions).\n- The authors point out the non-uniformity of errors, but do not provide actionable recommendations on how one ought to proceed with this knowledge.\n- R2, RMSE and MAE are correlated, no need to show them all in Figure 1.\n- The trends for all models in Figures 3 and 4 are roughly the same, suggesting that the non-uniformity in prediction error is due more to the dataset than any choice of architecture or molecular representation.\n- The UMAPs of Figure 6 are very uninformative, and do not appear to support the author's point, unless there are many red Xs at each point in the space. The point of this figure could be expressed very differently, perhaps by tanimoto similarities of these clusters compared to average similarity or something like that.\n- The point of Tables 2 and 3 could be expressed in just a few lines.\n- The paper says that 10 models were trained on 10 random train/val/test splits, which is not standard practice - the test set is usually fixed across all CV splits."

I think in the next iteration of this work, time needs to be invested to expand on the different terminology used in this paper. \n- In Figure 1, why are the duplicates in the x-axis and the legend?\n- In Page 4, section 2.3.1, paragraph 2, is it not rather that the ML model appears to perform better when the log S of the drug is *more* than -7 ?\n- In Figure 1&2, why do refer to the Area Under the Roc Curve (AUC), when the results are for the R2, RMSE and MAE ?\n\nI am also still unsure what is the CMP-CV workflow exactly.
