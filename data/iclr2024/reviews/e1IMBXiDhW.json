This similarity diminishes the novelty of this paper. Therefore, it is imperative to substantiate, either through theoretical or empirical means, the superiority of Matrix-SSL in comparison to I-VNE+.\n- The results presented in this paper are not significant to substantiate the effectiveness of Matrix-SSL. Notably, Table 1 does not incorporate the official performance metrics of SwAV, as reported in [2], which report values of 71.99, 73.85, and 74.81 for 100, 200, and 400 training epochs, respectively. Additionally, Table 2 lacks the inclusion of performance data as reported in [1]. When both Table 1 and Table 2 are appropriately updated, it becomes evident that the performance of Matrix-SSL is not state-of-the-art.\nFurthermore, it is important to note that this paper does not provide comprehensive benchmark tables, including but not limited to \"Semi-supervised learning on ImageNet\" and \"Transfer learning: image classification,\" as elaborated in Table 2 and Table 3 of [3].\n- In Section 5, this paper demonstrates that enhancing uniformity leads to an increased effective rank through matrix entropy. However, this result is not groundbreaking. In [1], the authors have previously presented these mathematical findings and have empirically shown that von Neumann entropy regulates uniformity, thereby influencing the effective rank.\n\n[1] VNE: An Effective Method for Improving Deep Representation by Manipulating Eigenvalue Distribution, CVPR 2023.\n\n[2] https://github.com/facebookresearch/vissl/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md\n\n[3] Barlow Twins: Self-Supervised Learning via Redundancy Reduction, ICML 2021."

                "value": "1. There are some issues with the mathematical symbol definitions in this paper, such as inconsistency in the usage of symbols, missing definitions for certain symbols, and incorrect usage of mathematical symbols. For example, on the second page, the lowercase letter \"z\" represents features, and in subsequent chapters, the bolded lowercase letter \"**z**\" also represents features. In the part of the definition of matrix entropy, the definition of the lowercase letter $\\lambda$ is missing. In the proof of proposition 3.3, there is something wrong with the infoNCE loss. I suggest that the authors follow the definitions provided by the original authors in their arXiv paper.\n2. How was Lemma 3.4 obtained? I understand the purpose of this Lemma, but it's better to give the proof or the corresponding reference. On the other hand, Lemma 3.4 shows that minimizing matrix cross-entropy between the Identity diagonal matrix and the covariance matrix can achieve a uniformity target. However, starting from the fourth page, the zero-mean assumption is disregarded. Does this have any impact on the theoretical analysis results? \n3. Starting from the third page, the authors consistently assume that the feature matrix is positive semi-definite. However, can this constraint be maintained in practice\uff1f\n4. In section 3, the authors analyze that matrix information theory could provide a unified framework for many existing SSL methods. Then, according to Theorem 3.5, Uniformity-MCE loss is equal to MEC loss. The experiments in Table 3 can verify this, where the result of Matrix-SSL (when $\\gamma=0$ ) is equal to that of MEC (70.6%). With an increase in $\\gamma$, the results will improve. This means that matrix alignment is indeed helpful for final performance improvements. Therefore, if we consider the alignment term along with the MEC loss, what will be the results? I suggest the authors conduct a detailed analysis of the differences between the MEC loss and the Uniformity-MCE loss, especially from an experimental perspective. I wonder if the gradient computation for the Uniformity-MCE loss is easier compared to the MEC loss.\n5. Although matrix-KL and matrix-CE share similar optimization properties and theoretical results, are they consistent in practical experiments? I recommend that the authors conduct a set of experiments to validate this."

                "value": "## INTRODUCTION\n\n- The following reference,\n\n[a] Ozsoy S, Hamdan S, Arik S, Yuret D, Erdogan A. Self-supervised learning with an information maximization criterion. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2022 Dec 6;35:35240-53,\n\nproposes utilizing \"correlative information\" maximization for self-supervised learning. Analyzing this paper within the context of the proposed matrix information framework would be interesting, especially since the authors of [a] assert that maximizing correlative information between the representations of augmentations establishes a linear dependence rather than an arbitrary nonlinear one.\n\n- Figure 1: The citation for Coco is absent. It would be beneficial to compare the performances of  Vicreg, [a] (Bardes et. al, 2021), and (Tong et. al, 2023).\n\n\n### 2.1 CONTRASTIVE AND NON-CONTRASTIVE SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING\n\n- First paragraph: The discussion here is based on the SimCLR and SimSiam, however, the authors introduce a generic SSL architecture. Furthermore, what is meant by dual networks is not clear at this point.\n\n- Would categorizing this section into subheadings like \"Contrastive SSL Approaches\" and \"Non-Contrastive SSL Approaches\" enhance clarity?\n\n- There seems to be inconsistency in the conventions used for sample and augmentation indices in Equations (2) and (3)?\n\n- For Equation (3), is there an underlying assumption about the normalization of the encoder,  such as  $\\||z_i^{(k)}\\||_2=1$ ?\n\n\n### 2.2 MATRIX INFORMATION-THEORETIC QUANTITIES\n- Could you provide a citation detailing Matrix Entropy. Furthermore, could you discuss its interpretation, and perhaps its existing applications especially within the context of machine learning/SSL?\n\n- Regarding the Matrix Entropy definition, is there a specific assumption about the trace of $\\mathbf{A}$ ensuring its eigenvalues form a probability mass function?\n\n- Can you provide interpretations and potential applications of Matrix KL Divergence and MCE?\n\n- Bach 2022's KL divergence doesn't seem to incorporate the  $-\\mathbf{P}+\\mathbf{Q}$ terms within trace? Could this discrepancy be addressed?\n\n- From the presented definitions, it appears that, unlike Shannon Entropy, MCE does not equate to the sum of Matrix KL and Matrix Entropy. Should there be a $\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{P})$ term included in the matrix entropy definition?\n\n- A brief discussion explaining the relevance of these definitions to the SSL problem would be insightful.\n\n\n### 3 MATRIX INFORMATION-THEORETIC PERSPECTIVES OF SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING\n\n- The assertion about proofs should be positioned adjacent to the first proposition, i.e., Proposition 3.1.\n\n- Proposition 3.3: The statement of the proposition is  ambigious:  InfoNCE cost in (1) is the MCE of which matrices? This should be clearly stated. Are InfNCE cost and SimCLR cost identical? The cost function obtained in the proof in terms of MCE does not match (1)?\n- The paragraph after Proposition 3.3: This part appears convoluted: Is $p_{data}=p_{\\mathbf{x}}$ ? and $\\mathcal{X}$ is the support set of $p_{\\mathbf{x}}$? I guess there is no clear definition of $f$ before. (there was $f_\\Theta$ and $f_\\phi$ without clear definitions before). $f$ is sometimes unbold and sometimes bold? Since $f$ is not prespecified, the assumption that there is a layer normalization $\\||f(\\mathbf{x})\\||_2^2=1$ is also not clear. Instead of stating \"straightforward calculation\", it is better to provide a proof of Lemma 3.4 with proper notation in Appendix A. In my opinion, both this paragraph and Lemma 3.4 is not properly motivated.\n\n- Lemma 3.4: Suggestion \"Let $\\sigma$ represent the uniform distribution on $S^{d-1}$. ...\".\n\n- The paragraph after Lemma 3.4: Change of variables formula? (Inverse image rule?). Why \"auto-correlation\" matrix for $q$ but \"covariance\" for $p_{data}$?  It is better for the authors to clearly state the uniformity principle. Can't we just say that we would like features $\\mathbf{z}$ to be uncorrelated? do we need the notation for $p_{data}$, $f^{-1}$.\n\n- Quoting the sentence: \"From Proposition 3.3, we find that SimCLR (InfoNCE) loss is not canonical for achieving matrix information-theoretic uniformity unless the covariance matrix is diagonal\". What do we mean by \"loss being not canonical\"? Has matrix information-theoretic uniformity been defined yet? Is this statement simply saying that  SimCLR or InfoNCE does not enforce feature whitening?\n\n- MCE-based decorrelation objective: why do we have a $\\lambda \\mathbf{I}_d$  perturbation for the desired $\\mathbf{I}_d$ matrix? it is already perfectly conditioned. This perturbation on the first argument of the MCE does not reflect on the right side of \n\n$$\\operatorname{MCE}\\left(\\frac{1}{d} \\mathbf{I}_d+\\lambda \\mathbf{I}_d, \\frac{1}{B} \\mathbf{Z} \\mathbf{Z}^{\\top}+\\lambda \\mathbf{I}_d\\right)=-\\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\log \\left(\\frac{1}{B} \\mathbf{Z Z}^{\\top}+\\lambda \\mathbf{I}_d\\right)\\right)+1+d \\lambda$$\n\nShouldn't there be a multiplier $\\frac{1}{d}$ or $\\frac{1}{d}+\\lambda$ in front of the trace term? I suggest that $\\mathcal{L}_{UMCE}$ should be defined at this stage.\n\n- The paragraph before Theorem 3.5: Suggestion \"This MCE based uniformity loss definition (or $\\mathcal{L}_{UMCE}$ ) and its Matrix-KL divergence based counterpart are closely related.... as outlined by the following theorem:\"\n\n- Theorem 3.6: Suggestion: .... under the constraint $\\||\\mathbf{z}_i\\||_2^2=1$, for $i=1, \\ldots, n$. The proof of Theorem 3.6 better be provided in Appendix.\n\n- Suggestion: The sentence \"Our formulation interestingly recovers the Maximal Entropy Coding (MEC) loss...\" can be written as \"The Maximal Entropy Coding (MEC) loss in ... can be formulated in terms of Matrix MCE..\" as\n\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{MEC}=-\\mu \\log\\det(\\mathbf{I}_d+\\frac{d}{B\\epsilon^2}\\mathbf{Z}_1\\mathbf{Z}_2^T)$$\n\n$$ =MCE(...., .....)$$\n\n- $\\mathcal{L}_{EMP-TCR}$: $\\bar{\\mathbf{Z}}$ is not defined. Only $\\bar{\\mathbf{Z}}_i$ is defined. Again there is a confusion of index representations relative to  Equation (1). It is understood from this statement that $\\mathbf{z}_k^{i}$ vectors were defined as row vectors. The article should set up the proper data model and notation at the beginning an should stick with that throughout the article.\n\n- Can we also have MCE based representation for the Corinfomax SSL provided in [a] above?\n\n- Overall suggestion: I suggest that the article defines all SSL-related loss functions in Section 2.1, instead of introducing some in Section 2.1 and some in  Section 3.1. Furthermore,  In Section  3.1, the article can clearly write each SSL loss function in the form \nMCE(... , ...) to show that they can be put in the form of matrix cross entropies.\n\n#### 4 MATRIX INFORMATION THEORETIC UNIFORMITY AND ALIGNMENT FOR SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING\n\n- First sentence: .... we would like embeddings to have zero mean and covariance ....\n\n- Sentence before Theorem 4.1: optimizing covariance matrix uniformity: is this maximizing $\\mathcal{L}_{UMCE}$ or $\\mathcal{L}_{UKL}$. This should be clarified.\n\n- Theorem 4.1. This needs to be clearly reworded with proper references to the objective function and constraints. What is \"effective rank\", how is it different than rank? If this is a constraint how do you pose it?  Is the argument of the MCE in the uniformity-MCE loss sample correlation or sample covariance? Is this theorem about  the following optimization?:\n\n$$ \\text{maximize } \\mathcal{L}_{UMCE}(\\frac{1}{B}\\mathbf{ZZ}^T)$$\n$$ \\text{ subject to } \\text{tr}(\\frac{1}{B}\\mathbf{ZZ}^T)=1$$\n\nThe proof of Theorem 4.1 in the appendix requires a rewrite: Dote (Typo?)  Denote? $\\mathbf{Z}$ can be confused as a matrix due to earlier notation. I guess the first sentence states that Let $\\mathbf{x}$ be a random vector, whose distribution has support $S^{d-1}$. Again what is effective rank? This proof needs to be in the form of a series of explicit mathematical assertions referring to a clearly stated optimization problem.\n\n- Lemma 4.2 is typically well known.\n\n- For $\\mathcal{L}_{Matrix-KL-uniformity}$,  $MCE$ is used not Matrix-KL measure. Why is it called this way?\n\n5 MATRIX-SSL: UNIFORMITY AND ALIGNMENT\n\n- Regarding the alignment cost based on Matrix: \n\n1. Again it is based on MCE rather than Matrix-KL. In fact after (11), it is stated that KL versions can also be considered. So why do you call it $\\mathcal{L}_{Matrix-KL-allignment}$ ?\n\n2. The fact that covariance matrices of two matrices are aligned with respect to MCE or KL does not necessarily imply that representations for the same image are aligned in the direction, where as euclidian distance based or cosine angle based approaches try to ensure that they are sample wise aligned. So why should $\\mathcal{L}_{Matrix-KL-allignment}$ be a better choice?\n\n### 5 EFFECTIVE RANK AND RANK INCREASING PHENOMENON\n\n- It is indeed surprising that effective rank is properly defined and connected to the framework of the article much later than it is already referred. \n\n### 6 EXPERIMENTS\n\n- It would be interesting to include Tong et.al, 2023 and [a] in the experiments for comparison.\n\n- Interestingly, the proposed Matrix-SSL method provides superior performance in experimental results. A natural question to ask if the authors reproduced the accuracy of other algorithms to calibrate their simulation and evaluation models.\n\n### 7 RELATED WORK\n\nThis section typically follows  the Introduction section. Furthermore, it should not be only stating the summary of literature but it should state the contributions of the article relative to these works."

It also does not report any mean +-\nstd over multiple runs.\n\nWhile I find the experiments convincing, it could reproduce\nstate-of-the-art better with other methods.  E.g. SimCLR is usually\ntrained for 1000 epochs, but this is not done in this paper."
