                "value": "This paper identifies the problem of equal treatment of tokens in LLM-generated text, despite variations in their relevance and representativeness due to linguistic redundancy. Existing methodologies overlook these generative inequalities, leading to biased uncertainty estimation where less semantically significant tokens receive excessive weighting. To rectify this, the proposed method, called Shifting Attention to more Relevant (SAR) components, suggests joint attention shifting at both the token and sentence levels for accurate uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments are conducted on various LLMs, including instruction-tuned models and pretrained models, using different question-answering tasks across domains like reading comprehension, science, and medical Q&A. The experimental results, along with a demographic analysis, demonstrate SAR's superior performance in addressing the challenges of uncertainty estimation in LLMs. Overall, SAR offers a promising approach to tackle hallucinations and improve uncertainty quantification in the context of LLMs."

However, as shown in Figure 3, this is actually the opposite since the token-level mean of UP is actually higher when the relevance is less. Could you please give an explanation for this?"

While there are many methods for this now, one common method is the predictive entropy, or the log probability of the generated sentence given the prompt. However, predictive entropy assumes all tokens are equally valued when estimating the uncertainty, even though not all of them contribute to the semantics (which determines correctness). To combat this, the paper introduces SAR, which computes a weighted average of the log probability of each added token, weighted by how much each token contributes to the semantics (measured by how much the semantics change when you remove a token). The authors also experiment with a similar procedure for sentences, where the sentence-level uncertainty is measured in terms of similarity to other generated sentences. The authors find that both the token and sentence uncertainties tend to outperform existing baselines, measured by AUROC."
