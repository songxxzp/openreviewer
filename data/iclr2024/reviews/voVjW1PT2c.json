                "value": "The manuscript proposes a new method for improving out-of-distribution detection in the presence of a finite set of auxiliary negative samples. The manuscript bounds generalization error using empirical error, reducible error, and distribution shift error. The latter is caused by the finite auxiliary dataset which cannot represent all possible test outliers. Therefore, the manuscript proposes an augmentation technique based on mixup which increases the variety of auxiliary data.  In practice, negative training samples are a convex combination of different auxiliary negatives. During inference, \n OOD samples are detected based on the classification confidence of K+1st class.\nThe proposed method achieves competitive results on relevant benchmarks for OOD detection."

For theorem 2, did the authors consider the sample complexity of both the vanilla auxiliary outlier set and the diverse outlier set? The sample complexity and model complexity should play an important role in the bound during analysis for these two cases.\n4. For theorem 3, I am curious how well the h_mix compared with the predictor h_div. \n5. It is still not intuitively making sense to me why does mixup can create diverse outlier examples. It will not change the data distribution much since it is only doing the interpolation work. What if the auxiliary outlier set is very constrained in the convex high-dimensional input space, would mixup increase the diversity of the outlier set significantly?\n6. If possible, the authors are encouraged to provide empirical evidence on large-scale benchmarks. The current setting does not seem to suggest the diversity will create a performance improvement significantly."
