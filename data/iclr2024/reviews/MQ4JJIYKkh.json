This is a new idea that could lead to potential benefits in learning personalized policies that are aligned with end users' concepts. The paper is well-written and clear and draws this important connection with previous work in cognitive sciences. \n\nOverall, the idea, while simple, leads to sensible improvements compared to other strategies that are agnostic to users' concepts. The authors verified their method also via user studies which confirms the superiority of the proposed method. Appreciably, the IRL formulation taking into account the user construal attains a higher positive correlation with the human inference reward.\n\nIn conclusion, the authors motivate and prove that the integration of the users' construals has its own merits and deserves to be taken into account for future improvements in the setting of IRL."

In the related work section, it is mentioned that Ho and Griffiths (2022) treated the problem in IRL. I understand that the fundamental contribution of the paper is essentially introducing (Eq. 3). The user concepts are already known beforehand and treating the hard case, where they are discovered or taken from a potentially big vocabulary, is only mentioned as future work for benchmarking this method. It is not clear what could be potentially cases solved by this approach, which requires more scrutiny. \n\nMoreover, no details are provided on how Eq. 3 is implemented and the experiments are entirely synthetic, which leaves open how the framework could be adapted and what the impact would be in real-world cases where users' construal may change more. How do you estimate $P(R, \\hat T)$? Is it already known beforehand? It is also not entirely clear what concepts $\\hat T$ encode, are they semantical concepts related to some properties of the world (specific to one user) or are they just non-interpretable values reflecting the state of the user? Are the user concepts causal in nature, or belonging to some ontology? How is this related to the standard use of concepts in explainable AI, e.g. [1,2,3]?\n\nMy feeling is that this work goes in the right direction but lacks a challenging case study for the proposed method which renders the contribution limited for a paper in this venue.

                "value": "It seems that the work is pushing for \u201cIRL agents attempting to learn from human trajectories should take into account human mental model of the task\u201d. There is a considerable body of work that highlights the importance of modelling human mental models for behavior synthesis (as an example [1]) in automated planning. That is, taking into account human mental models (such as the transition function being used by them) for agent tasks like behavior synthesis, goal recognition, intention prediction etc. is already well motivated (and the current discussion seems to rediscover this for IRL).\n\nEven in the context of IRL, the notion of the correspondence problem (see Related work in [4]) is very related here (not discussed in the paper). The key idea is the dynamics of the demonstrations are different than the dynamics of the agent and the mis-match causes issues with leveraging the demonstrations. In this work the mis-match is motivated through a specific situation where the human demonstrator plans on \u201csimplified dynamics\u201c, however the formulation does not make this distinction. With respect to the formulation the authors assume that the demonstrator has a different dynamics $\\tilde{T}$ where there is no formal restriction on  $\\tilde{T}$ and a loose specification that  $\\tilde{T}$ is \u201dsimpler or easier to solve\u201c. Typically correspondence problem has been viewed through the lens that the demonstrations were collected in a different domain and the agent is acting in a different domain (for example demonstrations is a real human providing robot arm movement and the agent is working in a simulated environment), which still satisfies the problem formulation in this paper, that the dynamics are different.\n\nThere are missing arguments on what  $\\tilde{T}$ can be. For example, it seems that it has to be defined over the same states and actions as the agent dynamics function  ${T}$ (through result in section 3.4 and equation 4). This implies that human mental model (or the dynamics they are using to come up with a plan) cannot have arbitrarily different state representations (which I believe comes from the authors description on \u201csimpler and easier to solve\u201d, but the formalism is unclear from text). \n\nThe example considered by the authors, as I understand, assumes that the demonstrator has a different dynamics function as a consequence of state-aliasing [2, 3] or perceptual aliasing (i.e. they mix up the light blue and blue cells etc.). These concepts are well studied in sequential decision making but the current manuscript fails to make essential connections highlighting limited literature review.\n\nAuthors have not reported IRB and subject study details like demographics.

As humans often rely on approximate models of the real world when planning their actions, evaluating potential preference models under the assumption that they plan under an exact world model may lead to incorrect inferences about their true preferences.  This in turn may lead to misalignment between an AI's future actions and what the human would have expected.\n\nThey formalize this problem in terms of Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning, where the \"true\" dynamics of the environment (which the AI knows exactly) are replaced with multiple possible approximations, which are jointly inferred with the reward function encoding the human's preferences.  Their main contribution is a set of experiments demonstrating that their \"construal\" IRL model matches the inferences of human subjects far better than standard Bayesian IRL in a navigation task where an approximate model leads to behavior that is very different from optimal behavior under the true model."

This issue takes on far greater significance today than it did a few years ago, as AI agents trained with human feedback and demonstrations are now widely deployed in the real world.  The work demonstrates that even in simple settings, failure to account for mental approximations can lead to catastrophic misalignment.  The key takeaway is that we must be careful when learning from humans that we account for limitations in the human's knowledge of the world, and how this might affect their behavior relative to their preferences.\n\nThe paper also draws important links between existing psychological research on human conceptualization and planning, and the problem of human-AI value alignment."

                "value": "My main concern is that there are conceptual barriers to applying the insights of this work to algorithms that scale to real-world problems.  Bayesian IRL can be viewed as a \"regularized\" form of behavioral cloning, where the preference for policies that are optimal under high-probability reward functions improves generalization from limited amounts of data.  The inference model proposed here retains this advantage because the space of reward functions and concepts is tightly constrained.  Scaled-up, however, both the reward model and the approximate planning model would need to be far more complex, to the point where we would not expect (an approximation of) Bayesian IRL to be any more sample efficient that behavioral cloning with a similarly complex policy model.  Put another way, given enough data and a sufficiently flexible reward model, we would expect \"exact\" Bayesian IRL to be able to predict human behavior as well as \"construal\" BIRL, with the difference in sample complexity becoming less significant as we scale up to more complex tasks.\n\nWhile I wouldn't expect the paper to solve these issues itself, a deeper discussion of these potential limitations would be useful to the reader.  It would also have been nice to see connections drawn between this work and more scalable approaches to learning from demonstration (e.g., Ho and Ermon, 2016)\n\nThe other weakness with the work is that the theoretical model is not itself particularly novel.  Essentially they do Bayesian IRL where the parameters of both the reward function *and* the dynamics model are inferred from human behavior.  A number of previous works have used essentially the same model (e.g., Herman et al. 2016)\n\nThe authors should reference previous work in this space, and highlight how the motivations of this work differ from those of previous works with similar mathematical models.\n\nReferences:\n1.
