                "value": "Despite the strengths of this work, there are few weaknesses that should be addressed. \n\n(1) FEATHER lacks the strong objective. The proposed approach seem not improve performance nor efficiency. I will explain next.\n- (1a) From the performance perspective, FEATHER does not provide performance improvement over other baselines (e.g. CoTTA).\n- (1b) From the efficiency perspective, while FEATHER updates a smaller percentage of network parameters when compared to CoTTA, FEATHER is less efficient than CoTTA. In essence, FEATHER adds extra parameters to the network making the forward pass more expensive. Further, the gradient calculation for conducting an update step of FEATHER and CoTTA are similar since FEATHER adds its adapters after every layer. Hence, the gradient will require a back propagation through the entire network. \n\n(2) Missing experiments. While the experiments in this paper covered 4 benchmarks, there are key experiments missing to validate the effectiveness of FEATHER.\n- (2a) Performance comparison. Strong and efficient baselines such as EATA, ECoTTA, and SAR shall be included in the main evaluation comparison. Appendix D only provides the comparison under one setup (ImageNet-C). \n- (2b) Since FEATHER is an orthogonal approach to TTA methods, why is it assumed that it does not need accessing source data? For example, if FEATHER is combined with EATA, source data is necessary for the anti-forgetting regularizer. Having said that, I think it is necessary to compare FEATHER to TTA methods that leverage source data.\n- (2c) Efficiency measures.  The efficiency comparison in this work is based on the percentage of parameters being updated compared to the total number of parameters. I am not sure if this is the right way to compare different TTA methods. First, FEATHER adds extra parameters to the network, and thus by construction, its forward pass is slower than the baseline (e.g. CoTTA). A comparison in terms of runtime and memory usage is more necessary. It is worth mentioning that methods like Tent and EATA only update the normalization layers making them even more efficient than FEATHER.\n\n(3) Writing. The writing of this paper can be vastly improved in several places such as:\n- The mathematical notation and problem description is not clear. In section 2 $f_\\theta$ outputs the prediction $\\hat y$ at the beginning, and later in the same paragraph it is assumed to output a probability vector.\n- The notation in the last paragraph in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are not clear. What is the element wise addition? how is that different from a regular addition? What is the input and output shapes of the adapting layers?\n- Section 3.3 should mention that FEATHER leverages the same loss function as CoTTA. It was only clear in the experiments how exactly the adaptation is conducted."

Note that these comments were not taken into consideration in the paper evaluation.\n\n- Both Figure 3 and section 3.2 are conveying a very simple message: Initialize the adapters with identity mapping. I would rather invest this space in more experiments with more insights (e.g. combining FEATHER with EATA).\n\n- Formatting and writing: The proposed method is simple while the methodology section is not. I would try to simplify the writing of Section 3 and remove redundant paragraphs.\n\n- Please consider reorganizing the tables in page 7 such that each table is presented with its own paragraph.\n\n- For ImageNet-C experiments, please consider a similar setup to the CIFAR10/100-C experiments where the corruptions are ordered, similar to the continual evaluation in EATA."

And adapters will be inserted in to the model between layers. However, there is no mention of where in the network the adapter should be inserted which is one of the most important aspects of method based on adapters. Where to add, from shallow layer to deep layer, or from deep layer to shallow layer, there is no specific experiment to analyze.\n2. Why ZERO AND IDENTITY INITIALIZATION preserves the source knowledge? Maybe a residue architecture with zero initialization will be more simple and effective?\n3. Difference with ECoTTA [1]. In fact, adding adapters between layers has already been proposed in ecotta, and in their analysis experiments, they tried a similar variation of the method in their paper (refer to Architecture design in Section 4.2 in ECoTTA [1]). The choice and novelty of adapter structure is still open to question.\n4. What we should be noticed is that parameter efficient does not mean resource efficient! Inserting adapter into the original model will leads more computational resource including FLOPTS and memory of GPU. But there was little or no performance improvement. \n5. Over claim on the combination of other methods. Combined with tent and cotta, there is no performance improvement.\n6. What is the objective function in the experiments of Table 1,2,3,4,5?\n7. The formulation of Lifelong/Continual Test-time adaptation have some inconformity with existing literature. In CoTTA [2], it is define as adapting the model to the test samples and make predictions for them in an online manner. The description in section 2 seems like an offline fashion.\n\nRefecrence:\n[1] Song et al., Ecotta: Memory-efficient continual test-time adaptation via self-distilled regularization.

In addition, FEATHER is memory-efficient as it reduces the number of parameters to be updated in the procedure of TTA.

In addition, as the reduced number of updating parameters does not always imply reduced computational complexity, it is necessary to report time complexity (wall-clock time to process a batch).

This would help to understand the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nThe proposed method seems an architecture-specific solution. Is it possible to apply FEATHER to other model architectures (e.g., ViT or other CNN-based ones)?\n\nCan you provide a comparison of TTA methods in terms of time complexity (wall-clock time) per batch? I do understand the time complexity would be proportional to the number of parameters. However, there can be other computational cost in TTA algorithms. For instance, in my understanding, COTTA is particularly slow due to the use of data augmentation to obtain a more robust pseudo-label.\n\nIn my understanding, it is straightforward to make a variant of COTTA, which updates only BN layers. Noting that adapting BN layers is parameter-effective in TTA, it is also interesting to compare FETHER to the COTTA variant, in terms of parameter complexity and TTA/CTTA performance."
