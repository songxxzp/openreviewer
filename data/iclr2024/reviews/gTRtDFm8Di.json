Based on empirical observation, this paper claims that the existence of OOD data can benefit the adaptation of the pre-trained model on shifted InD data. A TTA algorithm is further proposed with OOD data filtering and recycling, similarity-based data mixup, and contrastive learning with class-wise prototypes. Experimental results on CIFAR-10-C and ImageNet-C are illustrated. No theory is provided."

If test streams with OOD data have more data than those without OOD data, there is not enough evidence to show that the improvements come from auxiliary signals provided by OOD data rather than the increase of shifted data samples.\n   - Only batch norm adaptation is discussed and analyzed.\n\n2. The discussion about benign and harmful OOD data is not sufficient. \n   - According to which measure can we distinguish benign OOD data and harmful OOD data?\n   - Does the advancement of R3 come from the removal of OOD data or the preservation of benign OOD data? The main experiment results show that R3 only outperforms the clean stream baseline under a few OOD-contaminated scenarios. Does it mean that benign OOD data is also removed during the filtering process?\n\n3. The reason for using cosine similarity is not clearly stated. Using cosine similarity alone as the filtering scheme is also recommended in the ablation study.\n\n4. Why perform the filtering process on mixed shifted InD data?\n\n5. Discussions regarding the effect of batch size and the ratio of InD to OOD data on the performance of R3 are also recommended.\n\n6. Although it outperforms baselines in the mixed corruption scenario, R3 still fails to improve the pre-trained model on CIFAR-10-C+SVHN/DTD/DTD+SVHN and ImageNet-C with OOD data."

However, in this manuscript, the authors appear to replicate these observed phenomena without introducing novel insights or furnishing theoretical guarantees specific to test-time adaptation. This redundancy raises questions about the contribution and originality of the work, necessitating a more comprehensive justification to substantiate the research's value. Moreover, the term 'benign' in the manuscript is vaguely defined, leading to potential confusion about what constitutes 'harmful' or 'malignant' in this context. Clarification from the authors would enhance the paper's clarity.\n\n- The use of t-SNE visualization for validating assumptions on benign OOD data in the manuscript is notably heuristic and may not be entirely reliable. This situation gives the impression that the authors are attempting to validate one intuitive hypothesis using another intuitive tool, which significantly weakens the theoretical foundation of the paper.  \n\n- The proposed method simply concatenates three stages without offering additional insights, particularly concerning the so-called `benign OOD data'. The authors need to delve deeper and elucidate how these stages interact and contribute to handling benign OOD data. \n\n- The experimental results indicate that the proposed method only achieves marginal improvements, which raises further doubts about whether the motivation of the paper has been accurately conveyed and validated. The authors need to address this issue by providing a more thorough analysis of the results and discussing potential reasons for the limited improvement, ensuring that the paper's objectives and contributions are clearly and convincingly presented.\n\n[r1] Generalized Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Survey."

Moreover, I highly suggest the authors mix all 15 corrupted datasets rather than sampling a part of the test samples from each corrupted dataset, as the former one is more challenging to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed R3 method.\n\n- Could the authors provide information on the number of OOD samples (with novel classes) that are filtered out by your method? This would help further validate the claim of \"Benign OOD contamination.\"\n\n- Will the proposed method still be effective under small batch sizes, e.g., 1, 2, 4? It would be better to provide these results even though it does not perform well enough.\n\n- It would enhance comprehension if clear definitions of \"shifted InD\" and \"OOD\" were provided in the introduction. Additionally, it may be more appropriate to utilize alternative terms to describe \"shifted InD\" and \"OOD,\" as \"OOD\" inherently encompasses \"shifted InD\" for the sake of general understanding.\n\n- Many references have been published. Pls carefully check this and cite the corresponding published version.\n\n- It would be better to clearly point out that in Tables 1-3 the clean stream accuracy is measured by Tent. Additionally, in Tables 1-3, the performance gain of Clean Stream (Tent) over \u201cTest (no adapt)\u201d is lower than other TTA papers. I guess this is because the authors use ResNet-50-BN from timm. Here I suggest the authors could also provide comparisons based on ResNet50BN from torchvision and include the results in the Appendix."
