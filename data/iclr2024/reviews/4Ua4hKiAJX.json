                "value": "1. The paper used the number of walks for the connectivity measure $\\mu$. According to the preliminaries in section 2, it seems that the connectivity measure is an unnormalized adjacency matrix. However, in the theorem 4.1 of the citated paper (Di Giovanni et al., 2023), the number of walks are divided by power of minimum node degree. Following this, doesn\u2019t the adjacency matrix should be normalized using the node degree?\n2. For the necessity of sequential rewiring, authors claimed that instantaneous rewiring easily violates either locality or sparsity constraint. In Figure 3, authors conducted an ablation study on the number of snapshots. Is there any comparison with an instantaneous rewiring, i.e., snapshot being 1?\n3. The connectivity and locality measures are only computed once over input graph to make the rewiring process efficient. However, it seems that these measure might change after some sequential steps of graph rewiring. For example, the shortest-walk distance between two nodes might get smaller after some graph rewiring steps, leading to another graph rewiring rather than the authors intended. Is it just that the performance gap of computing measures once and at each rewiring step did not differ much?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I think there a few weaknesses. Part of my concern with the paper is that as detailed in point 2a, there are now many different rewiring techniques. However, I do not think we understand oversquashing yet. Hence for me new papers in the area either need to a thorough comparison with prior work to show empirical improvement. Or contributes to understanding oversquashing and I think this paper, unfortunately, does not do either. \n\n1) One big weakness is Proposition 5.2. The statement in the paper is informal and incomplete. However, the paper does not have a formal statement or a proof. This is a big concern. For example, for the informal statement $\\mathcal{G} = \\emptyset$ vacuously gives us the result. However, that version is meaningless. Hence a formal statement is needed. There is space in the paper for this discussion, the first few pages are quite repetitive. \n\nI see that page 14 has something that is called a proof. But without a formal statement the notion of proof does not make sense to me. And there is no formal statement. A.2 is thought of to be formal statement but it refers to a lower bound in 5.2 which is not clear. \n\n2) I have a few concerns about the experiments. \n\n    a) First, I think the paper compares against very few prior works. The paper does a good job of citing many prior works in the area but then only compares against two of them. The paper should compare against most of the following or explain why it is not relevant to do so: GTR (Black et al. 2023), BORF (Nguyen et al. 2023), DRew (Gutteridge et al 2023), DIGL (Gasteiger et al 2019), Expander propagation (Deac et al 2022), DiffWire (Arnaiz Rodriguez et al 2022). The paper even cites Br\u00fcel-Gabrielsson et al., 2022; Abboud et al., 2022, and  Banerjee et al., 2022 as further works with rewiring techniques. \n\n   b) I also have some concerns with the experiments that are present. First, as the paper notes the network from FOSR is the case that $L=1$. However, for the method proposed in the paper, the paper uses $L \\in \\{2,3,4,5\\}$. Since for each $\\ell \\le L$ we have a different weight matrix, this implies that the networks for LASER are bigger than the networks used for FOSR and SDRF. This is an inequity that could account for the improved performance. \n\n   c) Hyperparameter tuning. The paper mentions that they tune $L$ and $\\rho$ for their method. However, they do not perform any hyper parameter tuning for the comparison methods (SDRF and FOSR). They fix the number of edges to be 40. This is another thing that could account for the inequity between the methods. It is also not mentioned what number is reported, I am assuming that the experiments trained models for each of the hyperparameters, picked the setting with the best validation performance and then reported the test error, however it would good if this were explicitly mentioned (since Figure 3 reports the metrics on the test data for all hyperparameters). \n\n3) I think the fairer version for the experiments would be to sequentially rewire the datasets with FOSR and SDRF such for each $1 \\le \\ell \\le L$ all sets $E_\\ell$ have the same size. I think this would help determine if part of the reason for increased performance is the rewiring or the new GNN architecture.  \n\nThe next couple of concerns are more minor. \n\n4) In terms of the context for the work, I think the following could be clarified. The notion of oversquashing in Alan and Yahav 2021, and the other papers Topping et al 2022, Black et al., 2023; Di Giovanni et al., 2023 are subtly but in my opinion importantly different. Alon and Yahav 2021, is a more information theoretic issue that is highlighted. Vectors of a certain size can not aggregate too much information. However, the issue in Topping et al 2022, Black et al., 2023; Di Giovanni et al., 2023 is more about optimization rather than information theory. These papers talk about how the Jacobian has a small norm. Hence while both phenomena can be labelled as oversquahing I do think they are different and should be treated as such. \n\n5) The paper measures the \"information\" provided by the graph structure as preserving locality. Specifically, they say ``while the measure $\\nu$ is any quantity that penalizes interactions among nodes that are \u2018distant\u2019 according to some metric on the input graph.'' However, local structure of the graph and the information stored in the graph are not the same thing."

They argue that spatial methods tend to address over-squashing and local structure but may not preserve sparsity, while spectral methods generally handle over-squashing and sparsity but might not maintain local properties. \n\nTo tackle these trade-offs, the paper introduces a novel rewiring framework. This framework employs a sequence of operations that are sensitive to the graph's local characteristics, aiming to simultaneously meet all three objectives: reducing over-squashing, respecting the graph's locality, and preserving its sparsity. Furthermore, the paper discusses a specific instance of this proposed framework and evaluates its performance on real-world benchmarks."
