Differently from previous works, this paper proposes to decouple the exploration of the environment, which is done through a reward-free oracle, and the active learning of the reward, by querying the external evaluators on previously collected trajectory pairs. Specifically, the paper provides (i) new algorithms implementing this framework for PbRL in both tabular and linear MDPs, which are called REGIME and REGIME-lin respectively, (ii) the analysis of the sample complexity of the latter algorithms, (iii) an alternative feedback model in which the external evaluator provides preferences over action pairs, together with a corresponding algorithm variation that is called REGIME-action."

I found the claim of improved results w.r.t. prior works (e.g., Pacchiano et al., 2021) to be a little overstated: Previous works target regret minimization instead of sample complexity, which arguably makes the comparison spurious. Whereas it is important to show that REGIME improves their sample complexity rate, it is unclear whether the regret can also be bounded, which would result in a worse fit for online settings. Having said that, both the online settings and the online exploration/offline feedback collection look reasonable to me, hence the results in this paper are valuable. For this reason, I am currently providing a slightly positive evaluation, but I am open to increase my score after a deeper inspection of the analysis possibly revealing interesting techniques, and a convincing authors' response on the questions below."

                "value": "1) While it is widely known that Markovian policies are sufficient to maximize a reward function, it comes as a surprise history-dependent policies are not considered although the feedback is based on full trajectories. I guess this might be a consequence of the linear reward assumption. Can the authors develop on why Markovian policies are sufficient to actively generate trajectories for the feedback collection step?\n\n2) In the Preliminaries section, the paper claims that \"it is necessary to make structural assumptions about the reward\". Do the authors mean that the problem is not learnable without the linear reward assumption, or that *some* structural assumption is needed? Providing a lower bound would be clarifying of course.\n \n3) Related to the previous question, one may wonder whether assuming an underlying reward function is really necessary for PbRL. Can the problem be cast as a direct maximization of the human feedback instead?\n\n4) The action-based preference feedback looks somehow related to inverse RL, where the learner can query an expert on the optimal action for a given state rather than a preference between a pair of actions. Can the authors relate their findings with previous inverse RL literature? Do they think their problem is easier/harder than inverse RL?\n\n5) Can the authors discuss the novelty of their sample complexity analysis w.r.t. prior work? Is there any novel technique they would like to highlight?"

Where did you find the PAC bound?  \n- How computationally expensive is step 1 (e.g., line 5 in Algorithm 1, line 7 in Algorithm 2, line 5 in Algorithm 3)? \n- How do you think will your algorithms perform in practice? Do you anticipate any obstacles when deploying your algorithms (computational or otherwise)? \n- Intuitively, one would think that adaptive trajectory selection which queries human feedback after every selection would be advantageous compared to first selecting all trajectories without observing intermediate human feedback. In other words, you would expect *adaptive* experimental design to perform better than *offline* experimental design (even when it comes to PAC learning). Your results however suggest that \"offline\" trajectory selection does not hurt performance. Can you provide any reasons or intuition for this? \n- Hereto related, do you think that your approach of seperating trajectory selection and human feedback stages is applicable/useful for regret minimization as well?

Some experiment results (even on toy examples) are appreciated to show the effectiveness of decoupling the human labeling process and online exploration stage. The significance of the results cannot be fully verified without the proof of practical usage of these algorithmic designs, because the proposed algorithms may be computational inefficient, thus explaining the theoretical advantage of such algorithms rarely helps to explain the advantage of current PbRL used in practice.\n\n2. The setting looks like a combination of reward-free exploration and online PbRL, which are both standard in reinforcement learning and extensively studied. Therefore, it is hard to evaluate the technical contributions as a theoretical work. The subroutine to collect exploratory data with linear reward functions (using whether reward-free exploration oracle or linear reward-free exploration subroutine) used for human preferences, the MLE estimation of the underlying reward model, and the planning of the optimal policy seem to be slight modification of standard algorithms in the literature, as long as the proving tools.
