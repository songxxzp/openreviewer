They also show that this mechanism is specific to tasks that require retrieval from pretraining memory, rather than retrieval from the local context, by showing that removing many FFNs may not hurt the performance when the task only requires retrieving from context."

This contributes to the growing work on \"mechanistic interpretability\" of LLMs.\n\nExperiments:\n- The authors study LLMs ranging from 124M to 176B parameters on tasks involving capital cities, uppercasing, and past-tensing verbs in a few-shot setting.\n\n- They analyze the evolution of next-token predictions during the forward pass and find distinct \"stages\" - argument formation, function application, and saturation. The stages suggest the model \"applies\" a function midway through to transform the argument into the answer.\n\n- On GPT-2, they isolate vector updates made by feedforward layers that encode these functions and can induce the function when transferred to unrelated contexts.\n\n- They also show function application relies on factual recall from pretraining, unlike extractive tasks where answers are in context and much of the FFNs can be ablated. \n\nConclusion:\n- Despite the complexity of LLMs, they can exploit simple, intuitive algorithms like vector addition to solve certain relational reasoning tasks. This raises optimism that other complex behaviors may also reduce to understandable subprocesses."

It's unclear whether the insights generalize or are very specific to the particular tasks.\n\nThe experimental setup is not fully clarified - the paper would be strengthened with a more detailed discussion about how the stimuli (assuming it is not random sampling) and different hyperparameters were selected.  This would aid in reproducibility of the results.\n\nThe claim \"FFNs can be ablated entirely with relatively minimal performance degradation,\" is overstated. Some specifics - reciprocal rank is an overly forgiving evaluation metric from which to draw the conclusion. In particular, the intervention often is not strong enough to cause the correct answer to be ranked highest. For example, the target output token becomes the top token in 21.3%, 53.5%, and 7.8% of the time in the last layer in the world capitals, uppercasing, and past-tensing tasks.\n\nThe \"argument-formation\" evidence shown in the paper is very suggestive.

The paper would be stronger with a more complete discussion, or more experiments explaining:\n\t* Why does the LM need to do this for some of the tasks? Wouldn't argument information already be present in the earlier token(s) where the argument is actually present as suggested by the Geva 2023 and Meng 2022 work? Can't the LM simply use that information?\n\t* For the cases where this argument formation doesn't happen cleanly, how does the performance degrade?"

(If some scaling is needed, how is that scaling selected, and does that scale factor remain constant across the tasks/layers?)\n\n* Related Work => \"Our work builds on the finding that FFN layers promote concepts in the vocabulary space (Geva et al., 2022a) ...\".
