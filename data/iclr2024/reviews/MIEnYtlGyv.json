                "value": "1. I think the Property (3) in page 4 is very important. And many previous autoregressive models can not solve it well. Actually I think it is not difficult to define an E(3)-equivariant model currently as many previous works have solved it well. The diffusion model doesn't face the permutation-invariant problem. But it can be serious for the autoregressive model. The main paper claims the three properties have been proved in Theorem B.1. Unfortunately, I found the authors only proved the first two properties and ignored the property (3). I DON'T believe the current framework can guarantee the permutation-invariant even the embedder is E(3)-equivariant.\n\n2. I think many criticisms of the diffusion model such as EDM on page 6 are unfair. \n\na. \"Unlike autoregressive models, diffusion models do not flexibly allow for completion of molecular fragments\". Actually, it is not difficult for diffusion models to do completion sampling by replacement guidance without any extra training. Currently, the diffusion model works well on image completion and I also try it on EDM, it works too.\n\nb. \"To avoid recomputation of the neighbor lists during diffusion, current diffusion models use fully-connected graphs where all atoms interact with each other. This could potentially affect their scalability when building larger molecules.\" I believe it is even more challenging for the autoregressive model on the large molecules as the sequence could be too long. And the molecules in QM9 used in the experiment are very small. There is no evidence that the proposed framework performs better on large molecules compared with EDM.\n\nc. \"diffusion models are significantly slower to sample from, because the underlying neural network is invoked \u2248 1000 times when sampling a single molecule.\" It is true that for EDM it needs 1000 times denoising process. But actually, it runs very fast and supports batch sampling. I tested EDM on a single GPU A100, it takes 20 seconds to sample 50 molecules (a batch). I think the submission should provide their own sampling time to support this claim. \n\n3. Though the definition of the position distribution is very clear and reasonable, the current submission doesn't provide any details on how to sample from it after training. People can know $f^{position}$ for any given position, but it is not easy to sample from an energy function. I doubt this sampling process can be very time-consuming."

Since there are 64 spaced values for $r$, I am wondering how you solve them during the sampling process.\n\n3.
