Overall, the proposed method is to learn a set of filter/propagation matrices, called \"Jump\" in this paper; then it propagates messages based on every Jump separately and aggregates node representations from Jumps together for node classification. Another contribution of this paper is a newly proposed homophily/heterophily measure called \"Structural Heterophily\"."

                "value": "W1. The main drawback of this paper is its organization and presentation, which can be improved.\n\nW2. Some statements/claims from this paper seem problematic and not accurate. E.g., in Eq. (2), seems the propagation matrix/Jumps $J^k$ cannot be strictly termed as filters according to the definition from the graph signal processing [1]. Specifically, if they are constructed according to Eqs (2) and (4), they may not share the same set of eigenvectors with the original adjacency matrix.\n\nW3. The novelty of this paper is not outstanding. From a high-level view, the idea of a filter bank (i.e., a set of filters/propagation matrix) is included in many existing works, e.g., [2-5]. Also, the proposed heterophily measure \"Structural Heterophily\" is related to the existing measure \"edge homophily\". The difference between the \"Structural Heterophily\" and edge homophily is that (1) the numerator of the former is the # of different-label connected node pairs, and the numerator of the enumerator of the latter is the # of same-label connected node pairs; (2) the denominator of the former is topology smoothness and the denominator of the latter is the total # of edges.\n\nW4. In my view, some content is not necessary to be included in the paper, and it may distract readers from the main contribution. E.g., the introduction section includes too much technical content, which is not thoroughly explained within the Intro section, and is not helpful for readers to understand the whole story and the core idea. I suggest authors rewrite a part of them with more plain but intuitive language.\n\n[1] Shuman, David I., Sunil K.

            "questions": {
                "value": "Q1. In the 2nd paragraph of Section 2, it mentioned \"$l^*=\\arg\\min l^T\\Delta l$, where $l*$ is the smoothest labeling of V after propagating l(B) to l(U) through the edges of the graph\". I think this is not accurate. Solely based on the context provided in this paragraph, the $l^*$ should be a vector whose entries are all the same.\n\nQ2. In the 4th paragraph of Section 2, it mentioned \"We need to infer a hidden graph $G'=(V,E')$. However, the term hidden graph $G'$ is not used a lot and it is not clear how to infer this hidden graph. What is the relationship between the hidden graph $G'$ and the \"Jumps\"?\n\nQ3. What is the advantage of Structural Heterophily compared with existing homophily/heterophily measures? Also, according to the statement \"For $R > 1$ the graph is heterophilic\", so only $R=1$ the graph is homophilic? I think the statement is not accurate.\n\nQ4. On the top of Page 4, it mentioned \"unstable states u1, u2,\" and $\\bar{A}_1, \\bar{A}_2, \\dots$. What are those vectors and adjacency matrices? How to obtain them from the context? In the paragraph next, it mentioned \"if we relabel the white node, ....., the new Fiedler vector ul leading to the labeling l does no longer induce a sharp step function\". It is confusing since the Fiedler vector should only be determined by the graph topology, and not related to the labeling of nodes. In addition, what is the \"sharp step function\"?\n\nQ5. In Section 3, what is the relationship/difference between $f_{\\Theta}$ and $f_{\\theta}$?\n\nQ6. In a subsection named \"Exploration by Parallel Jumping\", the Jumps $J^k$ is presented as a tuple with three elements, but according to the context, the Jumps $J^k$ should be a matrix with the same shape as the adjacency matrix, which is confusing.\n\nQ7. From Section 4.1 we know the nontrivial eigenvectors $\\mathbf{U}$ are approximated by $\\mathbf{U}=f_\\theta(\\mathbf{A})$, and obtained by SGD optimizing the Eq. (3). Why not directly set the whole $\\mathbf{U}$ matrix as a free parameter and optimize it directly? What is the benefit of parametrizing it with input as $\\mathbf{A}$? The design for this part is not clearly explained.\n\nQ8. On page 9, it claimed that \"our method needs higher frequency eigenfunctions in order to capture the extreme degree variability of this dataset\". Any reference or evidence?"

To tackle this, the paper introduces the Diffusion-Jump GNN, a novel model designed to bridge distant homophiles through a \"jump\" mechanism. This jump is distinct from typical high-order GNNs and is anchored on a structural metric known as the diffusion distance. The paper provides a detailed experiment to validate the model based on multiple datasets and several other different types of models and achieves SOTA on some of the datasets"
