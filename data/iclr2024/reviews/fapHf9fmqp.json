The paper presents contrived example about the difference between the two density estimators and argue in favor of using the squared density estimator for spectral clustering and anomaly detection. \n- The paper proposes the SDO kernel, a stationary kernel whose RKHS norm involves derivatives of $f$ to a certain order.

The type of Sobolev norm $ \\sum_{|\\kappa|_1=m} ||D^{\\kappa} f||^2 $ seems quite unusual. \n\nWe know that the original Sobolev norm involves derivatives _up_ to degree $m$: $ \\sum_{|\\kappa|_1\\leq m} ||D^{\\kappa} f||^2 $, and the Sobolev spaces are norm-equivalent to the RKHS of a Mat\u00e9rn kernel (in closed form and well-studied). Could the authors explain why their choice of the Sobolev norm is useful, and what will the results be like if one uses the Mat\u00e9rn kernel in replacement of the SDO kernel? I think a good justification for this model choice is a useful addition to the paper, as the Mat\u00e9rn kernel is sufficiently close to a regularization on Sobolev norm, and the SDO kernel seems more difficult because of the reliance on using Fourier features to approximate its kernel values. \n\n- The paper's main method is marked as \"INER\" in Figures 1 and 2, but the text makes no mention of what it stands for: is this a mistake?"

                "value": "**Major**\n\n1. Page 1, Paragraph 1:\n> *While there is recent work for low dimensional (one or two dimensional) data... there still are very few non-parametric methods applicable in higher dimensions.*\n\nI'm not convinced by this motivation, for a two reasons. First, many nonparametric methods have been described for data of arbitrary dimension (including in some of the cited papers). However, standard minimax lower bounds show that high-dimensional non-parametric density estimation is statistically intractable, in terms of many performance metrics. Thus, I'm not convinced that a new method will perform well in high dimensions unless it makes some more explicit assumptions on the density being estimated. Second, while recent neural network based density estimation methods are technically parametric, the complexity of these models is so large that they often behave more like non-parametric methods; i.e., they can fit quite complex densities. So it's not clear that a new nonparametric method should outperform these models in practical applications.\n\n2. Eq. (1): This objective is unbounded if the order of the derivative $D$ is $\\leq d/2$ (since the Sobolev $W^{k,2}(R^d)$ contains singularities, which can be centered on the samples.) The assumption $m > d/2$ in Theorem 2 addresses this, but, when first seeing Eq. (1), I was a bit confused by this. So perhaps it is worth mentioning this assumption earlier.\n\n3. Section 1, Last Paragraph, and Section 2, Last Paragraph: Both of these briefly mention consistency, but no details are provided here regarding the type of consistency (in $L_2$ in probability) or the assumptions made.\n\n4. Section 3.1, just after Eq. (5)\n> \"there seems to be no computationally affordable way to restrict the optimization to the positive cone $\\mathcal{C}$... We resolve this issue in two steps...\"\n\nAlthough it seems reasonable in practice, the solution proposed here is *ad hoc*, and it's not clear how this relates to the consistency guarantee (Theorem 11). Ultimately, in Appendix K, the paper assumes \"positivity on the data points $x_i$\", and it's not clear whether this condition is likely to hold as $n \\to \\infty$. On one hand, the estimate might approach the true (non-negative) density, but, on the other hand, the number of points $x_i$ is increasing. So, I think this is a big hole in the consistency guarantee. To fix this, the paper should analyze whether the \"positivity on the data points $x_i$\" condition holds as $n \\to \\infty$, and whether any additional conditions are necessary to ensure this (e.g., it might suffice if the true density is bounded away from $0$?).\n\n5. While the experiments demonstrate impressive performance on an anomaly detection benchmark, it's not clear from the paper where this advantage comes from or whether it is statistically significant or simply due to chance. One way to strengthen this would be an experiment on synthetic data where one can clearly (i.e., in an intuitive and unambiguous manner) see the advantage of RSR. The synthetic experiment in Section 5 almost does this, but it doesn't go as far as quantifying the advantage of RSR.\n\n6. I didn't really understand the purpose of Section 5. The two curves in Figure 2(b) seem almost identical, up to a constant scaling factor. Since the $y$-axis log likelihood, this just looks like INER=(KDE)$^2$, up to a constant factor. Related to this, I didn't understand why \"the gap between the values on the first and second cluster [being] larger for the RSR model\" explains why RSR is better for anomaly detection -- what matters for anomaly detection is probably the *ratio of the between-cluster variation to the within-cluster variation*, but the within-cluster variation is also much bigger for RSR (INER) than for KDE.\n\n**Minor**\n\n1. Usually $\\mathcal{H}^a$ denotes the Sobolev space $W^{a, 2}$ (i.e., the space of $L_2$ functions with $a^{th}$ derivatives in $L_2$). I suggest aligning the use of $\\mathcal{H}^a$ in this paper with this more standard notation. In particular, it is strange to me that the derivative order is not explicitly denoted in this paper's usage of $\\mathcal{H}^a$.\n\n2. Page 2, Paragraph 1, Last Sentence: Should \"|f^*|_{L_2}$\" be \"||f^*||_{L_2}$\"? I believe this is a proper norm...\n\n3. Section 4, \"Single Derivative Order kernel approximation\": Although I realize this is not the intent, the name \"Single Derivative Order kernel\" makes me think \"first\" derivative, rather than a single derivative of arbitrary order. I suggest a more explicit name like \"$m$-order Derivative kernel\".\n\n4. The paper ends a bit abruptly. I think it would help the reader to end with a summary of the paper's key contributions and perhaps a discussion of the limitations and weaknesses of the proposed method."

A central idea of this paper is to estimate a square root of the target density function, in order to ensure non-negativity of the estimated density (after squaring). This is closely related to the proposal of [MFBR20], who propose a general framework for estimating non-negative quantities built on this idea. In the particular case of nonparametric density estimation, I think their proposal is very similar to the present paper's (namely, maximum likelihood with Sobolev norm regularization). They also propose various mechanisms to enforce the constraint that the density estimate integrates to $1$. How exactly does the present paper's proposal differ from that of [MFBR20], and what, if any, are the advantages?\n\n2.
