The paper provides extensive experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of GKD in significantly improving student model performance, particularly in tasks like summarization, machine translation, and arithmetic reasoning. The approach is supported by solid empirical evidence;\n\n2. The paper is well-structured, providing clear explanations and insights into the proposed GKD method.

Although the paper reports significant improvements in performance over baseline KD methods, a more extensive evaluation could strengthen the claims. It would be helpful to see comparisons on a wider range of datasets and tasks to demonstrate the generalizability of GKD;\n\n3.

I don't quite understand that since the student model itself is smaller and has poorer performance, the quality of the sequences generated by the student model is also not good. So why, judging from the experimental results, is it helpful to introduce output sequences from the student in the training set? Can the authors give a reasonable and detailed explanation?"
