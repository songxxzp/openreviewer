This is used as a measure to protect against adversarial parties even when they are able to steal a key, as obtaining a coherent decrypted message does ensure it is the correct one.\n\nCurrent schemes of plausible deniable encryption are either prohibitively expensive or only allow the decryption of a fixed set of keys. In the latter, the proposed defense is limited as it only increases the space of solutions by a constant factor. \n\nThe current work overcomes the limitations of previous approaches by providing a technique that allows to open plausible messages for each possible key of the encryption scheme in an efficient manner. This is achieved by combining encryption, compression techniques used in large language models and Huffman codes. The work evaluates which parameters impact in the probability of detection of correct messages. Under certain conditions, the proposed scheme shows resilience to frequency, correlation and information theoretical tests that attempt to differentiate between true and decoy messages."

I think such a strong concept of random numbers are not needed for the encoding level of the scheme.

Presumably, the LLM could be treated as a kind of \"shared setup\" parameter in the usual cryptographic formalism, and even large values of this kind are regularly considered as part of the cryptography literature. The experimental results showing the positive relationships between sampling strategies for various models are also suggestive that this strategy can be made to work. And some of the ideas about how to build sampling strategies and deal with, e.g., quantizing the distributions that must be sampled from seem useful and helpful."

                "value": "I would expect a paper on a cryptography topic - or really any topic in information security - to provide a concrete threat model or security model. In the cryptography literature, these are generally formal and mathematical - indeed, the paper _cites_ the relevant formalism near the end of Section 2. However, this work does not present any such model. Without one, it is unreasonable to make the sort of security claims that the paper makes, as all such claims are relative to _some_ security model. For example, deniability means more than simply extracting a plausible message distinct to the intended message: it should be difficult for an adversary to tell whether the message they received came from the \"real\" key or an alternative key and whether the message came from the \"real\" message generation process or a fake one. I didn't see any claims of this sort at all in the latter part of the paper, only claims about the experimental results. Without some kind of theoretical claim on the security of the system (\"security\" here meaning \"according to a goal and set of threats specified by the security model\"), it doesn't seem possible to claim that the system provides deniability or improves security (or even doesn't harm it!) in any specific use case.\n\nThe rejoinder to this could be that the paper implicitly adopts the formalism of Canetti et al. ,'97. But in fact the approach taken is very different: in this work, the encryption algorithm itself provides the \"fake\" random choices through the supply of a decoy key. Is this detectable by an adversary? It is not shown here that it is not.\n\nA much more minor point, but an important and closely related one: much is made in the argument against detection of the fact that the encoder's compression capability is good, in the sense that an encoded data stream should be indistinguishable from random in a frequency and correlation sense. In fact, it is a simple enough theorem in cryptography to be assigned as a problem on an undergraduate problem set that there exists a function which passes _any_ battery of tests for randomness and yet does not meet the formal requirements of a pseudorandom generator, in the sense that an adversary can perfectly predict its outputs given enough observations of its behavior. Statistical tests have a one-sided error here, but are being relied on for the wrong \"direction\" of the security argument (i.e., _failing_ the statistical tests would cause us to _reject_ the security of this scheme, but _passing_ them is not an argument _for_ such security). Indeed, the claim being \"tested\" here, that the encoded data stream be \"indistinguishable from white noise\" is a claim that the encoder itself is a semantically secure encryption scheme! (It very clearly is not - knowledge of the model used conveys a lot of information that could be used to distinguish the encodings of different \"true\" messages).\n\nLastly and an extremely minor point: Canetti's first name is \"Ran\", not \"Rein\" as the reference has it."

We encrypt a message m but first compressing it into a string of numbers $t_1,...$ and then encrypting these strings using standard encryption. Now, if we use a fake key, we end up with a random sequence $s_1,s_2,\\dots$ instead, which will lead to another generated (natural looking) sentence.\n\nThe paper then discusses some extensions, e.g., to use prompts to contextualize the message. For example if the message is a date, the prompt starts with something that guides the generated message to be a date.\n\nFinally, the paper does some statistical tests to see how indistinguishable are the original texts from the fake decoded variants, and concludes that hey are closely distribution but not fully the same."

More precisely, the objective is first to use the LLM to produce a low-level representation of the plaintext before encrypting it using a classical encryption scheme such as AES."

More precisely, using the compression capability of LLMs seem interesting approach to be able to achieve plausible deniability. \n-The paper is well-written and the authors have done a good job at introducing the necessary background on encoding and decoding. \n-Beyond the use of LLMs, the proposed approach is also tested on ImageGPT, which demonstrates the wide applicability of the proposed approach."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "-A detailed characterization on whether the encoding/decoding part can possibly cause a difference on the plaintext in the \u00ab\u00a0normal\u00a0\u00bb situation in which the encryption is performed normally is currently missing from the paper. For instance, what happens if the value of k is less than 32, does it mean that the decoding will result in a different message with a high probability?\n-The security analysis should also be more detailed. For instance, it is not clear what are \u00ab\u00a0the optimality assumptions\u00a0\u00bb mentioned in the paper that makes the ciphertext indistinguishable from white noise. Overall, the paper lacks a detailed proof of the security of the proposed scheme. In addition, it also lacks as a review of the main existing families of definitions of the concept of plausible deniability and a detailed discussion on how the proposed notion compares to this. \n-The transmission of prompting as as external unencrypted information alongside the ciphertext seems to defeat the purpose of plausible deniability as it will directly indicate to the adversary that there is a tentative to generate a message providing plausible deniability.\n-The frequency and correlation tests that are proposed to evaluate the random aspect of the encoded string may not be sufficient to provide a level of security that is required in a cryptographic setting. If possible the authors should clarify whether such test are sufficient to assess the quality and security of cryptographic random number generators.\n-It seems that even when the decoding is performed with a different key that a lot of the semantics is preserved (for instance an address is still decoded towards an address). This seems to result in the possibility for an adversary to infer some significant information about the cleartext, which is in contrast to other proposal for deniable encryption. This might be due the information contains in the prompt, which significantly contraints the possible decryption but still this leads to a non-trivial leakage."
