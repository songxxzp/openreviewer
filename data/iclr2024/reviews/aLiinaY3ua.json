This method uses saliency maps produced by GradCAM and makes them as different as possible. Specifically, it computes the cosine similarities between the saliency maps and uses their mean as the diversity loss function. SDDE performs better than previous ensemble methods. In addition, it performs well in OOD detection."

The main hypothesis that ensemble diversity is proportionally related to the diversity of saliency maps, might be invalid for other datasets. The validation process proposed in the paper might not work for other cases.\n- W3. SDDE can be applied to classification algorithms because CAMs are computed on the predicted classes.\n- W4. Table 1 is misleading. The authors adopted additional diversity metrics, but it is obvious that their method looks to have better scores because they specifically added an additional loss function for diversity, which is based on cosine similarity.\n- W5. The paper requires re-writing. The final method named SDDE_{OOD} is presented at the end of the paper, right before Section 6. The authors should describe this final method in Section 4.\n- W6. It looks like MAL (Maximum Average Logit) is one of the main contributions of this paper. However, there is not enough analysis on this."
