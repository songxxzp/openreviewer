                "value": "This paper proposes meta-learning prior distribution of parameters where the task solver of the inner loop is assumed to be the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. The gradient-based meta-learning such as MAML can also be interpreted as meta-learning mean vector of implicit Gaussian prior distribution. However, this paper argue the assumption of pre-defined form for prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian) can have limited expressiveness. To overcome this, this paper proposes non-injective normalizing flows for modeling the prior distribution. The experimental results show that proposed prior distribution consistently shows better performance than existing meta-learning methods."

Then the normalizing flow is applied to meta learning: This is a two step algorithm where first the samples for each task are propagated by the flow and then the flow is updated via an average over all tasks.

Some of the paper deals with the tails of pdfs. A detailed account of NFs trying to model heavy (light)-tailed distributions in [1]. The paper furthermore ignores important recent literature on NFs which is very related, for instance [2], [3].\n\n2) I am not sure about the novelty of theorem 3.1. It is presented and described in a way that lets one think this might be novel, but I think this is an easy consequence of the monge map being the gradient of a convex function. The Monge map should exist under these conditions, and as the gradient of a convex function it should also be what the authors call weakly increasing. (Also I think the authors should define weakly increasing as this is not standard defintions. It is only explained in the proof)\n\nOr to see it differently look at the Explanation of [1], where they argue how to construct the well-known Knothe-Rosenblatt transform, which should also give the same results as theorem 3.1. \n\n3) I dont understand non-injective Sylvester Flows. In the usual Sylvester Flow paper a more specific structure is used to ensure invertibility (they find conditions on the diagonal of the triangular matrices so that it is invertible). Here this looks more like a ResNet. Also the algorithm does not use any NF related concepts such as maximum likelihood training and only forward evals are needed. I am not sure whether this should even be called a normalizing flow? the only similarity i see is using a prior/latent distribution. \n\n4) I find it quite weird that the validation data is also used when optimizing the Sylvester NF. This however might be very common practice in meta learning, which I am not familiar with. \n\n5) The motivation for non injective flows in general is not super convincing to me. There have been some results (for specific NFs) that they are universal distribution approximators, i.e., having two lebesgue densities one can at least find a sequence of NFs with distance between the distributions going to 0, see e.g. [4].\n\n[1] Tails of Lipschitz Triangular Flows, Jaini et al\n\n[2] Generalization of the Change of Variables Formula with Applications to Residual Flows, Koenen et al \n\n[3] MetaFlow: A Meta Learning With Normalizing Flows Approach For Few Shots Learning, Ahmed et al \n\n[4] Coupling-based invertible neural networks are universal diffeomorphism approximators, Teshima et al"
