I am not sure the reference numbers for contriever are correct. I checked the contriever paper and saw ndcg@10 is 75.8 instead of 68 for Fever, and is 67.7 instead of 65 for scifact. More generally, the claim that some Contriever random seeds outperform some \"supervised\" models remains confusing since those models are not supervised directly on BEIR and are often outperformed by unsupervised models like BM25. Although more modern models will likely outperform both Contriever and BM25, such as GTR. Contriever paper, https://openreview.net/pdf?id=jKN1pXi7b0\n\n4. The plots are very hard to read with blurry and small text.\n\n5.

                "value": "Q1: After a quick search, it appears there are datasets specifically designed to measure gender bias for information retrieval. Did you consider using these datasets? How would they compare to your approach?\n\nQ2: Is gender / topic bias only a concern for dense retrieval? What about sparse retrieval?\n\nQ3: It does seem strange how Contriever seems to converge always to the same accuracy. Could this be due to some peculiar property of the Contriever training? Is it worth training not only on a different shuffle of the data, but perhaps removing some of the data too?\n\nQ4: There should probably be additional clarification for \"exceed the difference in per- formance from adding supervision (over unsupervised learning only)\", since models evaluated on BEIR on never trained directly on BEIR. I assume the supervision is from some other retrieval data such as MSMarco.\n\nQ5: Have you considered causes for variance in some of these datasets? For example, TREC COVID is very small (only 50 queries). HotpotQA is much larger but has one of the stranger evaluation protocols for BEIR, since the original HotpotQA relevance would typically require documents to be retrieved together and BEIR abandoned this.\n\nQ6: Did you consider that data shuffling for Contriever training may play a bigger role than the MultiBERT seed?\n\nQ7: \"The corpus could have lower quality or less informative articles about female entities, queries about women could be structurally harder in some way.\" It could be helpful to clarify this with some examples.\n\nQ8: Why did you choose contriever instead of modern alternatives? I realize that MultiBERTs allow for diversified checkpoints, but it may greatly limit our understanding when applied to retrieval. Are none of the modern retrievers compatible with BERT? Is there some option to provide multiple checkpoints for a modern retriever, perhaps through data shuffling or re-initializing some layers? Or perhaps a different retrieval approach focused on re-ranking the output of BM25 (this is only a rough idea, and I am not confident it is sufficient)?\n\nPresentation Notes\n\n* Figure 1 is hard to read. Perhaps remove background grid and make the reference line more prominent? Why are some plots missing the reference---should indicate if outlier is better or worse? Also the axis is so small... It could be better to include a subset here and put the rest in the appendix.\n\n* typo: there is a large range of benchmark performance across seeds [with for] identical contrastive losses"

The current presentation also makes it seem like the papers scope is much larger than it actually is. Else, please rationalize the scope and the framing of the analysis in greater detail.\n- Several claims in the paper (\"This highlights the gap between ... a limitation of the benchmark\", \"lack of correlation between extractability and performance points to a mismatch between the self-supervised contrastive training objective ...\") seem to imply that there is a problem with the BEIR benchmark tasks or the training objective for contriver because while the training improves extractability of gender and occupation it does not correlate with the benchmark performance. This is not a reasonable inference - an alternative is that the two attributes examined are insufficient for explaining the underlying signals captured by the benchmark tasks and for studying the influence of training. For example training may be improving the extractability of several other attributes not examined in this paper which may better explain benchmark performance. Please soften these claims and discuss the limitations of the attributes examined in this paper (which would of course not be a slight on this work).\n- Table 1 and Figure 1: Thank you for this analysis, this is interesting. While I understand that the analysis is somewhat tangential to the point of the paper, I would recommend some changes to strengthen this analysis: 1) It seems a bit misleading to report the max-min difference for various seeds as a measure of variance based on the seed. Please also report the standard deviation in performance across seeds - this is more common for reporting this kind of variance: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07778. 2) Please report similar statistics for other metrics like Recall@100. It may be the case that the large gaps in performance are a result of the metric choice (eg exponential gain in computation of NDCG) and the presence of unjudged documents in retrieval datasets. Deeper rank metrics will alleviate the latter issue. It would also be illustrative to understand the Recall since dense retrieval systems are usually used for a high recall first stage retrieval. 3) A few of the datasets used in the BEIR benchmark are quite small (~50 queries). Please consider computing statistical significances for the max-min differences. The differences are unlikely to be significant for all the datasets. 4) It is unclear why the seeds influence performance so much - please consider discussing this in greater detail - do the representations change massively due to random seeds? Do the score distributions for positive vs negative change across seeds? (similar to: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/menon22a.html) etc.\n- Please add a main number/caption for all figures and label the axis of plots aptly - they are missing in many places.\n- It's unclear what the procedure for measuring extractability of the gender:topic ratio is - please clarify this better.\n- Please consider citing: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3234944.3234959"
