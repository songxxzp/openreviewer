The notation $\\tilde{A}$ is used first without definition in Section 2. How is the potential outcome framework defined under $\\tilde{A}$? The equation (1) is also problematic as it should be $a\\sim \\tilde{p}(\\tilde{A}|X)$.\n\n2. The assumptions of this work also need more justifications. It looks like all the causal identification assumptions are based on the original treatment $A$ except the positivity assumption. Since the efficient function also contains $\\mu(X, $\\tilde{A}$)$, would more assumptions on $\\tilde{A}$ be needed like SUTVA?\n\n3. The proposed method is not new compared with the semiparametric literature and causal inference, by considering double robustness and the density ratio of two propensities. Please find the references below and justify them.\n\n- Yang, Shu, and Peng Ding. \"Combining multiple observational data sources to estimate causal effects.\" Journal of the American Statistical Association (2019).\n- Kallus, Nathan, and Xiaojie Mao. \"On the role of surrogates in the efficient estimation of treatment effects with limited outcome data.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.12408 (2020).\n\n4. The theoretical connections between Section 3 and Section 4 are weak. There are many theoretical works related to using neural network methods for nuisance function estimation. The authors may consider the following reference to complete the gap.\n\n- Farrell, Max H., Tengyuan Liang, and Sanjog Misra. \"Deep neural networks for estimation and inference.\" Econometrica 89.1 (2021): 181-213.\n\n5. Since the efficient influence function is derived, given Theorem 2, I am curious why not continue to get the asymptotic normality of the proposed effect? Specifically, the authors are using the asymptotic normal formula in their simulations. Or if the authors think it is challenging, why can you use this result directly in the simulation?\n\n6. Since the double robustness is one major advantage of the proposed method, it is better to conduct simulation studies to reflect this property. \n\n7.

However, it seems that the authors do not impose such assumptions. I am checking the proof, but could the authors provide intuitive reasons for the results? If this result is true, I believe that this is the theoretical strength of this study.\n\nThe above is also my concern because the posited assumptions are too weak to show the results. We usually impose some properties such as smoothness on the nuisance estimators to discuss convergence rates. Even if we obtain desirable convergence rates, neural network models usually do not satisfy the Donsker conditions. Therefore, I am afraid of missing assumptions or errorrness in the proof (I need to confirm the proof but have not yet done it...)."
