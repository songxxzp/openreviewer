In \u201chierarchy-agnostic visual-semantic alignment\u201d, it first encodes images and semantic labels in the hyperbolic space. Then it utilizes a Gaussian mixture VAE to align visual embedding with label embedding to yield a shared representation space. While in \u201chierarchy-aware semantic learning\u201d, it leverages triplet metric learning over label space to push the label embeddings away for those without hierarchical relationships while pull close those with similar semantics. Experiments are conducted over six datasets, showing the effectiveness of the method."

A potential baseline approach could involve performing all the loss terms in Euclidean space, such as triplet loss in Euclidean space.\n\n2. The paper does not provide explicit details on how the taxonomy of labels in different datasets is obtained. It would be beneficial to include information regarding the acquisition of label taxonomy and potentially include tree structures to visually illustrate the hierarchical relationships within the taxonomy.\n\n3.

Since the paper demonstrates the benefits of incorporating taxonomy as prior knowledge for recognition tasks in a close-vocabulary setting. It raises an intriguing question about the scalability of this approach to an open-vocabulary setting. Considering the superior performance achieved by visual-semantic alignment methods like CLIP on in-the-wild data, I am wondering whether this work can provide similar advantages in the open-vocabulary domain."
