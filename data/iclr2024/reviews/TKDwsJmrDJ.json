That said, my initial review will need to be considered with this context:\n\nDespite being on a topic outside of my wheelhouse, I found this paper mostly quite clear. The authors break down and describe in detail the two steps of their federated learning approach (the \"Assign\" and \"Contrast\" components), before conducting baseline experiments, to compare their methods with others in this sub-field. I particularly appreciated the simplicity of experiments (e.g. using simple BERT_tiny models, with simple objectives, on well known datasets, etc., as described in S3.1 and S4.1), so that as an outsider to this sub-field, I could rather focus on the paper's innovation (\"Assign then Contrast\"). \n\nFor the aforementioned innovation -- I really have a hard time understanding the impact of this new approach, within the sub-field. If most federated learning can indeed only work on homogeneous tasks, then it seems like quite an accomplishment indeed! And although I didn't understand everything, the explanation is thorough enough that it seems this approach could be loosely implemented by others, following the details of the paper. \n\nAlso in the end, I appreciate the discussions, with concrete take-aways and reflections from the analysis, so that I can better understand how something like this could be useful."

Here, I will attempt to make my best guess:\n\nWhile the \"Contrast\" part of the proposed method is focused around preserving privacy, it would have been nice to have some verification of this, as privacy is absolutely central to the proposed model. I genuinely do not work in privacy+fairness, so I do not know if leveraging contrastive learning is sufficient for protecting privacy.  \n\nOne last thing -- which is NOT a weakness, but I think addressing this point would be nice: \n\nIn the Introduction, the paper introduces the need for improved federated learning by essentially complaining that increased data protections hurt \"data owners\". This doesn't sound great... I for one am very grateful to have protections on my data, that keep companies from using my data in risky ways! Thus, I would encourage a slight re-framing of the introduction, that doesn't frame end-users rights for data privacy as a burden.  The rest of the paper is much better, in terms of framing for privacy protection, though."

Its unclear to me if these are simulated \"clients\", or real-life clients. I ask because, for some of the experiments in Table 2, the ATC results are quite close to other tasks, so its unclear to me whether minor improvements are statistically significant with such a small number of clients. Or, perhaps, is a small number of clients intentional? \n\n2. Verification: in real life, you would never use ATC w/o \"Contrast\", right? Wouldn't this put customer data at risk? Regarding the point I made in the \"Weaknesses\" section, is contrastive learning alone enough to safe guard against privacy leakage? \n\nI am interested in the answers to these questions, but as far as my final score from the manuscript, I am most likely to reference the other reviews and your rebuttals to them, when making my final decision, again because unfortunately this topic is far from my own research topic in NLP."
