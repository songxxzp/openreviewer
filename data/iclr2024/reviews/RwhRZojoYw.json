                "value": "I encountered challenges in comprehending certain sections of the paper, particularly sections 4.1 and 4.2. I believe the clarity of these sections could be significantly improved with revisions by the authors. Additionally, I have a few follow-up questions:\n\n1. Although the authors correctly emphasize the absence of a strong correlation between oversmoothing and test performance, it is essential to explore the specific conditions under which this correlation holds. This inquiry is vital because scenarios exist where the Normalized Dirichlet Energy may approach zero, yet the test accuracy remains high. For instance, consider a stochastic block matrix with two classes, where all nodes within one class map into a single representation, and the same occurs for the other class (to a different single representation. In this case, the Normalized Dirichlet Energy would be small, but test accuracy would be high. This raises questions about the circumstances in which oversmoothing genuinely matters and whether the metric employed is appropriate.\n\n2. Building upon the first point, the connection between oversmoothing and generalization performance appears to be meaningful primarily when oversmoothing occurs across different classes. Oversmoothing within the same class might not be as relevant. Therefore, it would be valuable for the authors to provide commentary, theory, and experimental evidence in this context, while also demonstrating the efficacy of their method in comparison to other approaches.\n\n3. My concerns extend to the topic of reproducibility. I was unable to locate any provided code or information regarding hyperparameter ranges. Inclusion of this information is crucial for transparency and for ensuring that other researchers can replicate the experiments.\n\nIn conclusion, the authors do illustrate that their method reduces the Normalized Dirichlet Energy. However, the actual benefits of their method for node classification tasks remain unclear, as well as its performance when applied to more complex graph architectures. Furthermore, it's uncertain whether their method is effective in the context of homophilic or heterophilic graphs. Therefore, based on these questions and concerns, I am inclined to recommend rejecting the paper. However, I am open to reconsidering this recommendation if the authors provide satisfactory responses and address these issues adequately."

                "value": "1. Wrong reference. To the best of my knowledge, Rusch et. al (2022) is not the original paper which first proposes the use of Dirichlet energy to analyze oversmoothing in GNNs. The first paper is Cai and Wang (2020). Please correct the citations in Section 3.1.\n\n2. Missing state-of-the-art literature on oversmoothing. Recently there has been substantial progress made in terms of theoretical understanding of oversmoothing in GNNs such as Keriven (2022) and Wu et al. (2023), where these works rigorously show that there is a \u201csweet spot\u201d between smoothing and oversmoothing in order for GNNs to perform well for node classification tasks. It is thus not appropriate to claim that \"an important takeaway from our work is that the true causes and consequences of oversmoothing are vaguely understood, especially its relationship with overfitting and generalization.\" Please improve literature review.\n\n3.  No explicit mathematical form for the normalized Dirichlet energy (NDE) and NDE is not a good metric to measure oversmoothing due to at least the three following issues:\n\n- It does not satisfy the criterion proposed for node similarity measure in Rusch et al. (2023), which the authors has relied on as a gold standard for measuring oversmoothing. NDE does not satisfy the criterion proposed in Rusch et al. (2023) because NDE = 0 does not imply all nodes having the same representation vector. It is thus invalid to conclude from NDE that \"oversmoothing is still occurring according to the formal definition introduced by Rusch et al. (2023)\" from NDE.\n\n- It is obscure to interpret. The reasoning in the paragraph above section 3.2 is entirely heuristic. \n\n- It is not well-defined for 1-d features (all 1-d features have NDE = 0) and cannot be grounded in practice, as it disconnects oversmoothing from model performance.  Consider the following example: suppose that one wants to do a classification task for two group of nodes, where we have one-dimensional, linearly separable features: group 1 all have representation -1, group 2 all have representation 1. Now NDE is 0, which indicates \"oversmoothing\" according to the paper, but classification result is perfect.\n\nDue to the above reasons, the observation and interpretation drawn upon oversmoothing based on NDE in this paper is not valid.\n\n4. Insufficient empirical evaluation. \n- DropEdge and DropMessage can also easily be applied during test time. Although the authors argue that random dropping methods could introduce too much noise during test, the paper does not provide empirical evidence. Please add experiments supporting the claim that using them at test time really reduces model performance.\n- In Figure 1, it seems a GNN with skip connections are perfect remedies for oversmoothing, but it is not discussed in the paper and not included as a baseline method in Fig 3. and 4. Please add it as a baseline and discuss. \n\n----\nReferences\n\nRusch et. al (2022). Graph-coupled oscillator networks. ICLR 2022.\n \nCai and Wang (2020).

As the authors themselves pointed out in the paper, however, this metric does not correlate with performance accuracy well. On the one hand, I understand that there is no universally agreed metric for evaluating oversmoothing, and I agree that the normalized Dirichlet energy metric used by the authors is a sensible one. On the other hand, I believe that whether a smoothing effect qualifies as an \"oversmoothing\" depends on whether the node features give rise to bad final performance (in an extreme case, if constant node features yield the best results, then it is debatable about whether these constant node features are \"oversmoothed\" or \"appropriately smoothed.\") Hence, to enhance our understanding of how dropping interacts with oversmoothing effects, I recommend the authors to either: \n\n(i) Plot the normalized Dirichlet energy (x-axis) vs. accuracy (y-axis) frontier for models. This could be informative as the normalized Dirichlet energy alone may not fully reveal oversmoothing in node features.\n\n(ii) Use perhaps more than one metric to evaluate oversmoothing. The Dirichlet energy is one such metric, but other metrics exist. For example, another way of evaluating oversmoothing is to use the influence scores of nodes (Xu et al. 2018), among many other ways.\n\n[1] Representation Learning on Graphs with Jumping Knowledge Networks.
