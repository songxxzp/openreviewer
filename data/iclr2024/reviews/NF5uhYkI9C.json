There is not such thing as generating thick slices from thin slices. Voxel spacing and in particular the resolution within the z axis of a scan strongly depends on the image acquisition and reconstruction process, including the properties of the scan used. In reality, both in clinical practice and research it is much more desirable to have high resolution (what here is denoted as thin slices). This is not often possible due to constraints in the acquisition process, but always desired. Hence, there is no such thing as generating \"thick slices\" from \"thin\" ones.\n\nOn the methods side, the contributions are marginal. The proposed approach consists on resampling thick images to make them thin. Then a network is trained by using a loss (cross pseudo supervision) that has previously been proposed in the literature. This work extends it to 3D, which seems straightforward, and use of it to train the model."
