Inequality (4) should include not only second-order terms but also third-order and higher-order terms. Utilizing a varying matrix D^t is more effective than using a constant stepsize D to capture the curvature information of the nonconvex objective function.\n\n-- Even though Assumption 2 holds, the authors employ a global convex majorization function in Inequality (4), which may lead to slow convergence due to its potential looseness.\n\nW2. The authors claim that their proposed methods take advantage of the layer-wise structure of neural networks, but in the experiments, they only focus on the logistic regression problem with a non-convex regularizer. Additionally, the neural network architecture is not defined.\n\nW3. This stepsize is the minimizer of the right-hand side of the normalization upper bound in (10) under certain conditions. It is not clear why this results in the \"optimal stepsize\".\n\nW4. Solving the log-det minimization problem under the constraints specified in (21) can be challenging and impractical, particularly when the dimension $d$ is large."
