Then, it proposes a new nonconformity score that only keeps the top predicted probability but uses ranks for the remaining classes, and shows in the experiments that such score typically improves efficiency."

In general, the smaller the better. RAPS gives more efficient predictions on those observations with higher difficulty, while the proposed SAPS only gives efficient predictions on a shorter interval of difficulty.\n\n* Even though the proposed method has a promising performance compared to several methods, how is the proposed method far away from the ground truth? \n\n* To make it clearly catch the whole scope, it would be better to explicitly outline the calibration and prediction under the frame of a pseudo-algorithm as the one in RAPS. For example, I believe \"We choose the hyper-parameter that achieves the smallest set size on a validation set\" fails to disclose the entire picture because the smallest set size on a validation set cannot secure the desired coverage. How did the authors handle this issue?\n\n* The proofs are not friendly reading (see the section on questions).\n\n* Minor issues:\n  * Do you mean $\\mathcal{C}(\\boldsymbol x_i, y_i, u_i)$ for the definition of coverage rate?\n  * Double-check all the usage of \"i.e.,\"\n  * 0.05 instead of 0.5 in Section 4.2.\n  * In the proof of Lemma 1, did you intend to assume $p_{(k)}\\geq \\frac{1}{k}$?
