How did the authors determine an appropriate Lipschitz constant? Or, are there any assumptions on the time discretization in the proposed method? \n2. I do not fully understand the major differences between the techniques of the proposed method and Data as Demonstrator (DaD) proposed by Venkatraman et al. (2015)? I think the core idea is similar; therefore, it is worth discussing the advantages of the proposed method.  \n3. Two augmentation techniques are proposed, but I am unsure whether either would be equally useful. Is it possible to conduct an additional ablation study where one of the techniques is removed? \n4. In the paragraph above Definition 4, the authors introduce $\\mathrm{Support}(d^\\pi)$, but it is not defined. Is $d^\\pi$ a stationary distribution induced by $\\pi$? \n5. The first paragraph on page 5: $\\hat{f}(s_t, a_t) \\to s_{t+1}^* - s_t^*$ should be $\\hat{f}(s_t^*, a_t^*) \\to s_{t+1}^* - s_t^*$. \n6.
