The proposed framework highlights an underlying probabilistic graphical model for self-supervised learning (SSL) and a corresponding ELBO-like objective. Experiments are conducted on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10 and Celeb-A, against SSL and VAE-based baseline models. The results highlights (i) that the proposed approach is competitive on simple datasets in terms of discrimination performance with SSL, with the advantage of retaining both information about content and style thanks to the generative aspect and (ii) that there exists a gap in discriminative performance between the proposed approach (also VAE models) and SSL on natural images (CIFAR-10)."

To improve this, the authors presented SimVAE to enhance SSL. It is a hierarchical VAE by further factorizing the latent $p(z)$ into $p(z|y)p(y)$, where $y$ is the \u201csemantic content\u201d such as different classes (e.g., different dog breed classes) or different instances (different dog image samples). The choice of $p(y)$ is Gaussian or uniform, and $p(z|y)$ is a low variance Gaussian. The authors derived the ELBO bound for SimVAE and showed promising results on MNIST and FashionMNIST while also showing results not as competitive as other SSL methods on Celeb-A and CIFAR-10.\n\nDespite good efforts, the current shape of the paper lacks many sound technical details to be accepted at ICLR."

This is a vague statement without mathematical backing.\n\n3. *Page 5, \u201cHence geometric properties of representations implicitly correspond to latent probabilistic assumptions.\u201d* \n* The authors could have shown theoretically rigorous proof to show this. And it is unclear what specific geometric properties the latent probabilistic assumption induced.\n\n4. *Page 5, \u201cAnd $z$ may be only identifiable up to certain symmetries\u201d* \n* The authors may specify what \u201csymmetries\u201d mean exactly in terms of the identifiability results and may cite related works.\n\n5. *Page 5, \u201cand insight into the information captured by representations from their regenerations\u201d*\n* The reviewer is not sure this claim is valid without further explanation; why do generative models have better insights into the information captured by the representation? It is better to define the \u201cinformation\u201d here, as in SSL literature, there are numerous works studying the information the representation captures (some of which the authors rightfully cited) [5-9].\n\n6. *Page 5, \u201cNote that if the variance of each $p(z|y)$ is low relative that of $p(z)$, this fits with the notion that contrastive methods \u2018pull representations of related samples together and push those of random samples apart.\u2019\u201d* \n* It would be much more valid if the authors showed proof of this. Also, it is not clear how to define rigorously \u201cfits with the notion,\u201d e.g., via asymptotic analysis.

Factorizing $p(x)$ into the form of Equation 4 is a good start, but it did not justify why heuristic clustering methods are working well or necessarily capturing $p(x)$ well, e.g., through a tight error bound.\n\n8. *Page 6, \u201csamples of each class differ only in style (and classes are mutually exclusive) this collapse leads to style-invariant representations.\u201d* \n* Despite correct intuition, this statement is, in general, very strong; Dosovitskiy et al. did not explicitly claim anything about the style vs. semantic information in the representations, and the authors did not cite any other work supporting this claim nor specify any assumptions.\n\n9. *Page 6, \u201cUnder softmax cross entropy loss for mutually distinct classes (cf mixed membership), all representations of a class $y$ converge to class parameter $w_y$.\u201d*\n* It is quite unclear what \u201crepresentations converging to class parameter\u201d means without any additional context.

It insists on the distinction between discriminative and generative SSL algorithms. The authors claim that while the former are generally easier to implement & train, and seem to generally produce better latent representation, they are actually very opinionated on which information is kept in the latent representation and which is discarded. The author argue that this is a result of the discriminative nature of the training process, which tends to only keep information necessary for the discriminative task and discard the rest. On the other hand, generative algorithms must retain as much information about the data as possible to fulfill their reconstruction training objective, and thus are theoretically capable of producing richer representation that contain more of the information from the data.\n\nTo try and bridge the empirical gap between those two families, the authors propose a graphical model representation that generalize the structure of many discriminative SSL algorithms, and use it to build a generative SSL model: SimVAE. It uses a hierarchical latent structure to encode the information that some training examples are related to each other without encouraging the model to discard information differing between them.\n\nThe proposed SimVAE is show to improve over other generative SSL models for downstream classification from their learned representation, in some cases being competitive with discriminative algorithms. Evidence is also given to the fact that SimVAE does learn richer representations than discriminative models, allowing better classification performance on secondary characteristics of the data."

It has been shown that it controls the signal/noise trade-off of the model, and thus how much information is stored in the latent representation of VAEs, which is of particular interest here (see for example [Dosovitskiy and Brox, 2016](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2016/hash/371bce7dc83817b7893bcdeed13799b5-Abstract.html), [Rezende and Viola, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00597), [Loaiza-Ganem and Cunningham, 2019](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/f82798ec8909d23e55679ee26bb26437-Abstract.html), [Berger and Sebag, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01972), or [Langley et al, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12533) for discussions about the observation model).\n\nAs a result, I believe that this parameter has potentially a large impact on SimVAE's performance as a representation learning method, and leaving it to $1.0$ (according to appendix A.4.3) is likely to be too large a value, causing the model to discard significantly more information than appropriate.\n\n**Hierarchical VAEs:**\n\nThe idea of hierarchical VAEs built on a chain of latent variables is not new, and there is a wealth of models build on latent structures similar (if not identical) to SimVAE. While as far as I remember SimVAE is not redundant with these works, I find it lacking that they are not mentioned in the paper, and that SimVAE is not positioned relative to them. A few non-exhaustive examples: [Rolfe, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02200), [Dilokthanakul et al, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02648), [Edwards and Storkey, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02185), [Bouchacourt et al, 2018](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11867) or [He et al, 2019](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgsCjCqt7).\n\n**Minor points:**\n\nI think it would be an improvement to explicitly state what models of $p(y)$ and $p(z|y)$ are used in your experiments among the various possibilities that are suggested in Section 4, and how the training loss given in Algorithm 1 is derived from them."

The lower-level latent variables correspond to the learned representations while the higher-level latent variables correspond to class/clusters. The authors propose an ELBO to the marginal log-likelihood and propose an algorithm to optimize the ELBO. The authors demonstrate that the resultant representations outperform representations learned by VAE.\n\nOther than that, the authors propose variational approaches for performing instance discrimination, deep clustering etc."

The primary contribution of the paper is equation (7) defined over J semantically related samples. The rest of the paper is filled with a lot of claims that do not belong to the paper. For instance, section 4.1 has a latent variable approach to instance discrimination. It is neither interesting nor surprising that a latent-variable version of instance discrimination or any other model can be created. Unless it serves some purpose or offers extra insights, it should be removed.\nEverything except 4.2 needs to be removed from section 4. \n\n2) Having an entire section for representation learning is again wasteful. The representation learning section needs to be moved to related work.\n\n3) The authors should include the algorithm in their main paper rather than keeping it in the appendix.\n\nI have put other issues in the Questions section"
