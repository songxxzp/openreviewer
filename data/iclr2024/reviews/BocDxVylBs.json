The paper discusses the compatibility between the FL part and CB part in the FCB design and proposes a federated inverse gap weighting (FedIGW) algorithm to solve the FCB problem, which is an extension of the inverse gap weighting (IGW) from conventional CB problems to FCB. Theoretical results on performance bounds are provided for the FedIGW, along with numerical results."

Table 1 is a good summary of the current SOTA FCB works with their respective FL and CB components, but it is unclear how the convergence rates and regret compare to this work.\n2. The improvement over the previous works in FCB seems marginal, it seems to be replacing the UCB or other no-regret CB algorithm with IGW in the local CB part with marginal benefits including \"avoiding complicated data analysis in UCB\". It will be better for the authors to further elaborate on the advantages (e.g., convergence rate, regret, compatibility) of FedIGW over FL + UCB designs.\n3. I can not locate a definition, proposition, or theorem that discusses the compatibility/incompatibility of the FL and CB parts. This makes the reader unclear as to why not combine any SOTA FL and CB design to solve FCB and have to stick with FedIGW.\n4. The problem is limited to a finite action set, which I think could be a limitation of IGW, and the potential issue of discretizing continuous action space is not discussed.\n5. No confidence interval for the plots, this is a necessity. The authors should consider adding intervals with high transparency (e.g., low alpha values in Python) in the figures in the main article."

Will an alternative design where each agent applies different CB algorithms locally benefit the system? If not, what is the main problem with the alternative approach?"

This allows the method to decouple CB and FL components and adopt versatile FL protocols. The paper adopts IGW as CB component to estimate local reward function, and conduct the theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm. The paper also conducts experiments to validate the proposed method with different FL protocols."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. One advantage of federated learning is that it allows the local computation to be decoupled from the global aggregation, i.e., the server may use various global aggregation rule to aggregate clients\u2019 local updates, and clients can use different methods to update their local models. Different combinations of local computation and global aggregation result in different algorithms. I believe such flexibility also holds naturally for contextual bandits: if we let each client\u2019s local model be client\u2019s reward function, then the clients can use different methods to update their reward functions and the server can use different rules to aggregate the local reward functions. Since the main advantage of FedIGW is that it allows us to use versatile FL protocols, it is unclear to me why this idea of having decoupled components of CB and FL is novel in FCB. \n2. In FedIGW, we can use arbitrary FL protocols but the CB component has to be IGW. I believe any other methods should also work, as long as it can estimate reward function. Are there any other reasons for using IGW? Since IGW and the corresponding theoretical analysis were proposed by prior works, the contribution of this paper is somewhat marginal. \n3. Decoupling CB and FL in FCB has been proposed in Agarwal et al. (2023), and the authors argue this paper has additional contributions by having theoretical analysis. However, most of their theoretical analysis is adopted directly from IGW-type CB algorithms. \n4. The experiments are not sufficient. The authors only evaluate the proposed algorithm (with different FL protocols) without comparing it with other FCB algorithms. More extensive comparison with other FCB algorithms, especially the one in Agarwal et al. (2023) which also decouples CB and FL, is necessary."
