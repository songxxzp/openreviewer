                "value": "1. The novelty of the formulated problem, as well as the method design is limited.  Specifically, the problem formulation in Eq. (1)  is mostly the same with Eq. (3) of Lira [A], except for some minor differences like separating poisoned and clean datasets.  The solution to solve the proposed problem is also quite standard by alternating optimization of the two variables, which is also adopted by  Wasserstein Backdoor [B]. The generator of the trigger is also following the autoencoder structure as adopted by [A].   In this sense, the proposed attack seems to be a direct migration of Lira into a federated learning setting, which looks quite incremental.  \n\n2. The defense baselines are not comprehensive. The authors can consider adding more defense baselines, e.g., RLR [C], Crfl [D],  to show that the attack can successfully break through defenses other than cluster-based filtering.\n\n3. It is unclear why optimizing the triggers can guarantee a better attack towards cluster-based filtering (or minimizing the distance of updates with the poisoned update), as this is not reflected in the problem formulation. See details in my questions part.\n\n4. There are some issues with the experiment results and the setup. The baseline benign accuracy is very low (shown in Table 2, 61.73% benign accuracy for CIFAR10 with ResNet, and also low for TinyImagNet), which makes the correctness of the experiment implementation questionable.  The setup of local epochs is also strange, in that the malicious clients run more epochs than the benign clients. This might introduce bias to other baselines because this would make the malicious updates significantly larger than other benign updates, which may affect the performance of other attack baselines when against filtering-based defense.   Also, the authors should test the results in IID setting as well as various Non-IID parameters to show its effectiveness. \n\n\n[A] Doan K, Lao Y, Zhao W, et al.

However, it is later claimed that \"Inspired by (Doan et al., 2022), we divide local malicious training into two phases. In\nphase one, we fix the classification model f\u03b8 and only learn the trigger function T\u03be. In phase two, we use the pre-trained T\u03be\u2217 to generate the poisoned dataset and train the malicious classifier f\u03b8\". In my understanding, the two descriptions of alternating optimization are identical. Can the authors elaborate on it?\n\nIt is claimed on page 4 that \"A stealthy backdoor attack on FL should mitigate the routing introduced by backdoor task and guarantee the stealthiness of model parameters instead of just the hidden features of poisoned samples compared to their original inputs\". However, it is unknown how the authors are achieving this goal with their problem formulation in Eq. (1)."

In the centralized setting in [1] [2], trigger generators specific to every label need be trained one time before machine learning, and it still require some training time. I wonder is there any modifications the authors made to increase the efficiency of the training to achieve a flexible and adaptive attack? \n\n\n[1] Doan, Khoa, et al. \"Lira: Learnable, imperceptible and robust backdoor attacks.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF international conference on computer vision. 2021.
