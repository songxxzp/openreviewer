They provided a small dataset of full manual alignment between those edits and the reviews and a larger low-recall high-precision automatically evaluated dataset using an additional signal from rebuttals. Models are then presented both for generating those edits in response to review comments and for locating them within a text."

Insofar as there is the whole field of peer review segmentation and typing  (e.g. Xua et al. 2021, Cheng et al. 2021, Kennard et al. 2021, Dycke et al. 2023), it might be worth checking if any of that is relevant for use (some of those may also be relevant to the analysis types)."

As the authors claim, GPT-4 often addresses responses on a superficial level without including technical details. It is totally unclear why such superficial or pretending responses are necessary.\n- Even though the comment-edit alignment task is a binary classification task, the overall results are very low, much lower than 50%, which may imply that this data or this task is an ill-formed one.\n- The details of the data construction and the task description are not understandable without referring to appendices."

How are those F1 scores calculated?\n- According to the precision and recall scores for the macro evaluation, the performance of BM25 looks better than or at least competitive with those of GPT-4 multi-edit. It would be better to discuss the differences between the results of those models.\n- What is the motivation behind setting the edit generation task?

While GPT-4 can generate edits on a surface level, it rigidly follows the wording of feedback rather than capturing the underlying intent and tends to include fewer technical details than human-written edits. The findings suggest the need for further research in this area, emphasizing the complexities of reasoning about scientific text and addressing challenges in aligning feedback to edits and generating meaningful revisions."
