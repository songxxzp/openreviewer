SiBBlInGS utilizes channel-similarity and state-similarity graphs to uncover interpretable BBs, providing insights into the system's structure and variability across different states. The framework is demonstrated to be applicable across various data modalities, offering a deeper understanding of functional circuits, task encoding, and state modulations. It is validated using neural data from a monkey's somatosensory cortex during a reaching-out movement experiment, showcasing its potential in neuroscience for analyzing complex datasets."

In particular in the context of PARAFAC a lot of recent literature exists that generalized PARAFAC to explicitly account for temporal dependencies. Such approaches should be discussed explicitly and systematically benchmarked. In particular the authors should consider [1,2,3], where temporal information and different states over time are modelled via GP priors or parametric regularizers.\n- The experiments are very limited. While there are some analyses on synthetic data, they should be extended to include more baselines and also demonstrate how the proposed Method works in different settings for high-dimensional time series data e.g. such as anslysed in [1]\n- Results from baselines should also be discussed for the real-world applications\n- I find the presentation of the paper could be improved: it requires a lot of jumping back and forth between appendix and main text for important results and to gain a good understanding.  I also found the results of the real world applications hard to understand.\n\n\n\n[1] Wang, Z., & Zhe, S. (2022, June). Nonparametric Factor Trajectory Learning for Dynamic Tensor Decomposition.

The paper discusses the limitations of existing methods for understanding multi-dimensional data and how SiBBlInGS addresses these limitations.
