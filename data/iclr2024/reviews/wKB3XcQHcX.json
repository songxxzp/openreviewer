Characterizing the speed limit using the Wasserstein-2 distance is not easily interpretable since it is in general hard to compute the Wasserstein-2 distance. The paper seems only able to derive interpretable results under limiting conditions like no noise or infinite parameters.\n\n3. The models considered in this paper are fairly simple. Both the linear regression and the learning under NTK assumption are linear models and are not representative of deep learning in general.\n\n4. The writing of the paper can be improved. I hope to see formal theorems in the paper stating the main contribution, and notations need to be clearly stated. For instance, I am not sure what is $Z_T$ and $Z_0$ in Eq. (4).

It derives analytical expressions relating the speed limit (minimum training time) to the Wasserstein 2-distance between initial and final weight distributions and the entropy production. For linear regression and neural networks in the NTK regime, exact formulas are provided for the quantities involved in the speed limit. Under plausible assumptions on the NTK spectrum (power law behavior) and residue (defined as the target minus the initial prediction), NTKs exhibit near-optimal training efficiency in the scaling sense. Small-scale experiments on CIFAR-10 qualitatively support the theoretical findings."

It would be nice to cover the case of either the perceptron or the NTK starting with $\\theta_0 = 0$. \n\nIt is rather unclear whether there are any takeaways from practitioners.

Can the authors comment on whether this is representative of realistic datasets? \n\nThe initial transient period seems important. The current characterization is that the low modes are learned very quickly during this period, however many other things are also happening. For one, the kernel could be drastically realigning its eigenstructure (as in e.g. Atanasov Bordelon Pehlevan https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00034). Relatedly, it would be interesting to see these empirical results for the NN as the feature learning parameter (as in $\\alpha$ in Chizat and Bach https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07956) is varied. \n\nIt seems strange that in the high noise regime the formalism tells the perceptron learns in \"zero time\" when really its unable to learn at all. Am I understanding this correctly? \n\nTo the best of my understanding, the only setting in which the W2 distance enters practically is when the marginals are delta functions. So it only is realized as the 2-norm in weight space. Is there any use to the optimal transport formalism beyond this?"

Is $10^{-5}$ really small enough? is Myrtle-5 wide enough to consider that we are in the NTK regime?\n\nOther questions:\n * Eqn (10) is difficult to interpret: in the proof, the effective learning rate is $\\eta/n$; how such a proof can be interpreted in the limit $n \\rightarrow \\infty$?\n * I may have misunderstood one point: Figure 1.b seems to indicate that the training time is about $10$-$30$ times larger than $T_{SL}$. We are far from the \"$O(1)$\" factor written in the claims... while it is true that the ratio of the trajectory lengths (Fig. 1.e) is of order 1. How to solve this contradiction?\n * it is clear to me that the result written in Eqn. (10) depends on the distribution of the data. To obtain such a result, the data are assumed to be Gaussian.
