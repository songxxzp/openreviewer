And we all know that these metrics can not accurately measure image quality. \nMoreover, in Fig 6, Fig 8, Fig 9 and Fig 10, it is not obvious whether KC loss yields better results. I think the authors need to at lease hightlight the region or illustrate using zoom-out regions to show the difference.\n\n2. Although I also appreciate very much those early works about natural image priors, I think most of them are based on simplistic assumptions which may not be needed in today's large-data-driven methods.\nMore specically, I doubt that why kurtosis-based losses suit for the mentioned artifacts problem? Actually, losses need to be designed based on properties that you want to distinguish. I think at least statistics of a large amount of artifact images are needed. to prove kurtosis is a proper metric.\n\n3. In Fig 1, the authors show severe unnatural artifacts. However, I wonder is that really a common phenomenon? It is more like a bug in training process, and similar artifacts are not present in the other illustrations in the paper. Then what exactly are the types of artifacts that the authors want to solve?\n\n4. In Equ 5, the authors claim that diffusion models are typically trained using reconstruction loss in image domain. However, as far as I known, many diffusion models do not use such reconstruction loss, for example DDPM, DDIM. \nMoreover, the loss and optimization of diffusion model typically follow mathematical derivations. I wonder if we incorporate KC loss, do the training process still theoretically sound?"
