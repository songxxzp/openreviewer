Integrating the concept of contrastive learning into semi-supervised learning is not a novel approach, and several similar studies have been conducted previously [1,2,3,4]. The authors should analyze and experimentally compare their method with these previous approaches.\n\n2. As mentioned in the previous question, the Related Work in this paper is not comprehensive, lacks a summary and analysis of prior work, and fails to highlight the contributions of this paper.\n\n3. The experimental section lacks an introduction to baseline methods, and many experimental results are missing from Table 1. It would be preferable for the authors to mark the missing results with horizontal lines.\n\n4. The author's expression is inconsistent. In the first paragraph of the Introduction, the author states that the exemplars theory emphasizes the uniqueness of different samples within the same category. However, in Section 3.2, the author claims that the exemplars theory suggests that samples of the same class should be similar, and pseudo-labels are calculated based on the similarity between samples and exemplars. It is unclear how the uniqueness of samples is reconciled with this.\n\n5. The nomenclature in this paper should be more standardized. For instance, do ${\\Phi _c}$ and ${\\phi _c}$ represent the same thing?\n\n6. The article is difficult to understand, and the authors should restate the motivation of this paper and clarify the relationship between motivation and the proposed method. For example, how are prototype theory and exemplar theory reflected in the methodology, and what role does the typicality gradient play in this paper?\n\n[1 ]Li J, Xiong C, Hoi S C H.

The exemplar-contrastive self-training algorithm involves several hyper-parameters, including thresholds, margin values, and labeling rates. The sensitivity of these hyper-parameters could present challenges during practical implementation, as selecting the right values may require thorough experimentation and tuning.\n\n3. While the paper mentions that the computational burden is reduced by deferring the computation of exemplar feature vectors until the labeling phase, it lacks a comprehensive analysis of the algorithm's computational efficiency. The practical implications and potential computational overhead of the entire algorithm should be subject to in-depth investigation and evaluation."
