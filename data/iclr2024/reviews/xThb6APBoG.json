Especially for the recall metric, it is standard so it\u2019s not clear why no standard baselines or datasets are used. The internal dataset does not add much value to the paper, as the details are unclear, will not help reproducibility, and the real-world impact is not clear given no online experiments. There are many ways to compose a task that do not optimize recall metric so it is not clear why such task is chosen. The authors implemented the basic base models themselves. The choices also look arbitrary, such as the choice of certain model architectures, the LLMs used (while assuming they are reliable which is not the case - despite recent papers on the popular topic, they hardly beat previous tuning methods). All these will make the impact of the work hard to be measured and the reproducibility of the proposed method extremely difficult.  \n\nW2: RL in information retrieval has a very rich literature, and optimizing arbitrary metric is inherited from RL, so the novelty/story from this perspective is limited. The major contribution is really the algorithm mentioned in S1, but the significance of the proposed method is unclear."

In light of all these possible alternatives, what are the reason to believe using the REINFORCE algorithm for the fine-tuning step is an impactful approach and not just another approach?\n\nCan you better describe the intuition why the convergence speed of the algorithm is substantially increased from framing the problem as having the states being pairs <state, item> and having binary actions?\n\nIn addition to the above explanation, I would also like to see a detailed formal description of the resulting MDP and the application of the Theorem in Mei et al.
