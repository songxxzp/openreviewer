They formulates continuous-time learning as an optimal control problem, connecting learning dynamics to Hamiltonian equations. They additionally show how taking the limit as propagation speed goes to infinity recovers backpropagation, suggesting backprop may emerge from local learning rules.  Ultimately, their framework requires solving Hamiltonian equations with boundary conditions, but the authors propose approximating the solution using only initial conditions via time reversal techniques."

Their model has a notion of spatio-temporal locality, which allows them to express some constraints on the computation. They introduce a variational problem, although it wasn't clear to me what the relevance of this particular functional or its stationarity is. This allows the authors to derive a set of Hamiltonian equations. After this, I lost track of the direction the paper was going: the locality constraints were reconsidered, and there was a consideration of boundary conditions, followed by the introduction of some time-reversal transformations that I didn't understand in this context.\n\nI wasn't able to understand how the conclusion related to the mathematics presented."

This sounds a lot like reinforcement learning. Indeed there are some further resonances with reinforcement learning further through the paper where the authors mention dynamic programming, and their introduction of a Lagrangian-like variational objective, and the subsequent transformation into a Hamiltonian problem reminds one of the relationship between value functions and the local behaviour of optimal policies. I think if the authors wish to present to a broad audience it would be useful to address this question of the relationship to reinforcement learning, which is likely to come up."

While paper pays a lot of attention to careful notation and definition of the computational model, some of the concepts come out of the blue, either undefined or defined much later into the paper.\n\t* I understand that some of the concepts are not defined as they are common knowledge in the field (e.g. costates). However, my comment above is not only about those (see below)\n\t* What is pre-algorithmic view?\n\t* 'spatiotemporal locality' comes up already in the abstract/intro, but gets defined much later after all the computational model formalism is done.\n\t* I don't think, IN^i from (5) is defined.\n* **Lack of examples**. I understand that it is common in the theoretical community to define things in a most general way possible. However, I think it will be highly beneficial to bring parallels to the machine learning case by giving examples even for the variables involved. For example, $l(w, x, t)$ comes up in equation 8, but only much later (Theorem 2 at the bottom of next page) the paper mentions that this can be a sum of the regularisation term and an indicator function on the neurons outputs multiplied by some function L, i.e this is a loss function! Same applies to other variables, e.g. $\\xi$ and $\\mathbf{u}$. Section 2 defines $u$ as d-dimensional and $\\mathbf{w}$ as a concatenation of all weights in the network, i.e. n-dimensional. However, the function $l$ defined in (9) takes $\\mathbf{w}, x, t$ as inputs, but function $l$ in (11) takes $\\mathbf{u}, \\xi, t$ as inputs. If I understand it correctly, these $\\mathbf{u}$ is a control variable and is not the same as the input trajectory defined in Section 2. But having a clear example would greatly decrease the confusion.\n* **Existing literature**. The paper is motivated by biological learning where the organisms do not have access to the entire data collection (\"the agent can only use buffers of limited dimensions for storing the processed information\") However, the paper ignores the existing literature on Online Learning and Online Optimisation, that are highly related to the topic. Putting the work into this context would be highly beneficial for the community."

Which one do you imply in Section 2? Do you intertwine the two as you mention in the second paragraph of Section 1 (\"we assume that learning and inference develop jointly\")? Could you provide a toy example?\n* \"we show that the on-line computation described in the paper yields spatiotemporal locality, thus addressing also the longstanding debate on Backpropagation biological plausibility\".

Should there also be an acyclicity constraint that does not allow \"inputs -> A-> B->A\" within the same time step?\n* For me, equation 8 comes out of the blue. Section (2) introduces the computational model and the constraints on it. Beginning of Section 3 mention CAL (Betti et al., 2019) for FNN (feedforward NN?). And then you say \"we claim that in an online setting the laws of learning for recurrent architectures can also be characterized by minimality of a class of functional. In what follows we will then concider variational problems for the functional of the form\". Could you explain where does equation 8 come from? Is the mc/2 * |w|^2 the reqularisation term? If yes, does the $l$ in equation 8 differ from the $l$ in Theorem 2 that already includes the regularisation term?\n* \"The local structure of equation 10, that comes from the locality of the computational model from Section 2 guarantees the locality of Hamilton's equation 12\".

Could you explain the jump from considering RNNs to FNNs?\n* (Corollary 1) \"the proof comes immediately from equation 16.\" Could you add a couple of explicit steps for me to understand why this is the case?\n* \"This is a strong indication that when solving Hamilton's equations with an initial condition on $p_w$ we will end up with a solution that is far from the minimum\".
