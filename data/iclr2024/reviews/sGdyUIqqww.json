Unfortunately there is only one qualitative comparison to this, and it is unclear how effective this comparison is at showcasing improvements.\n    - The single qualitative comparison does have a text prompt (\u201cremove the vase\u201d), but is essentially the task of object removal. \n        - This does not seem representative of the task of object editing. For instance, I could not find any qualitative results (of which there are many) in Instruct-NeRF2NeRF that show object removal. \n        - Is this a fair comparison? The proposed model uses a separate method of image-to-image translation for object removal, Blended Latent Diffusion, than Instruct-NeRF2NeRF does. If this image-to-image-translation model is used, this comparison is not helpful. I.e. the comparison shows not the method\u2019s contributions, but rather the effects of using a different image-to-image translation model\n        - I\u2019m not sure object removal is a good way to spotlight the capabilities of this method, i.e. 3D consistency. An ideal comparison would be a video of both methods side-by-side in a task where the model modifies the original content slightly (e.g. adding a mustache), rather than two images of it making an object disappear.\n        - Another contribution it would be important to measure is diversity. Quantitatively, this could be measured for instance via LPIPS distance between outputs, per Huang et al. Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation ECCV 2018\n    - There is also only a single quantitative comparison (CLIP, FID) to Instruct-NeRF2NeRF. It is understandable given the original paper only reports CLIP-based metrics. However, it would be helpful to have e.g. human studies on the consistency / preference across methods.\n- Ideally, all experiments would have some measure of quantitative success. Even if there is no prior work (e.g. in zoom out, colorization), reporting standard metrics gives a sense of accuracy and allows future work to compare on these tasks.\n\nThe wording \u201cuniversal image-to-image translator\u201d is used several times throughout the paper. However, it seems the method uses different image-to-image translators for different tasks. \n- From the supplemental section 1: it seems text-driven editing uses Instruct-Pix2Pix, super-resolution uses ResShift, object removal uses Blended Latent Diffusion, etc.\n- In light of this, what does \u201cuniversal image-to-image translator\u201d mean? Does this mean the method learns to jointly encode a variety of image-to-image translation model outputs? This seems to be a main contribution of the paper, but it is unclear what is being proposed / the contribution."

The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative NeRF latent space to model the distribution of 2D edited imagery. The process begins with applying 2D image editing techniques to the original multiview images, followed by training a generative NeRF on this dataset utilizing a combination of KL divergence, reconstruction, adversarial, and contrastive losses.

The edits involving human subjects lack realism when compared with those from Instruct-NeRF-to-NeRF. Furthermore, these edits seem to introduce unintended distortions to the background.\n4. The object removal attempts beyond the 2m13s mark are particularly problematic. It appears that the method modifies the color fields within NeRF rather than executing an actual removal of geometry. Clear artifacts at 2m18s underscore this issue.\nIn summary, it's challenging to endorse the method as capable of producing high-quality and view-consistent outputs. The removal functionality, as it currently stands, seems ineffective within the demonstrated approach.\n\nThe video used to illustrate performance is overly simplistic and does not sufficiently convey the method's efficacy, particularly concerning view consistency.

Clarification on the number of samples used for these calculations would also be beneficial.\n\nThe current results lack the polish and sophistication one might expect. It would be advantageous to showcase a more diverse and challenging set of results, such as adding accessories to a figure (e.g., a mustache and a cowboy hat, akin to the results in Instruct-N2N), removing specific regions of complex objects like the Gundam, or altering the material and lighting effects on an object like the bull.\n\nBy addressing these points, the paper could significantly enhance the robustness and appeal of the proposed method."

                "value": "The authors propose GenN2N, a unified framework for editing tasks by lifting 2D edits into 3D radiance fields. To account for the inconsistency in the 2D edits, the framework learns a latent code to characterize the different changes. Several design choices are employed to ensure sample-able, view-consistent edit codes that generate high-quality edited scenes. The method is tested on a variety of tasks and shows improved results. Overall this unified framework ensures a general strategy to lift 2D image edits to 3D."

It's still a bit confusing for me to understand the \"real\" input to the discriminator. \n- I would urge the authors to include more qualitative comparisons against baselines for comparisons. Fig. 1 only compares their method against InstructNerf2Nerf for a text prompt that removes an object. \n- I was wondering if it's possible to construct a baseline inspired by InstructNeRF2NeRF for other tasks - for example colorization. Or at least it would be interesting to directly compare against the 2D edits performed on top of a NeRF rendered image i.e. optimize NeRF for a scene, render views, and apply the 2D editing model on the rendered views to show that the lifting features are indeed improving consistency."

It would be really helpful if the authors could clarify the same. \n- What are the values of M? The number of edits performed on each view. \n- To clarify, even for the same edit style for different viewpoints, there exist inconsistencies? Isn't it counter-intuitive that the contrastive loss then tries to minimize the difference $z_{i}^{j}$ and $z_{k}^{k}$ where $i \\neq j$"
