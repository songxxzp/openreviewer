If we are able to generate the target data, where other options include using powerful generative models [1], why do we need pre-training? It seems to be more a question of when is pre-training necessary. \n    - It is also not clear if pre-training in general is useful as the experimental results were only shown with one type of pre-training method and a different pre-training for different datasets. How sensitive are the results to the choice of pre-training method?\n    - From Table 2, it seems like the results are sensitive to the target augmentations. For iwilds most of the gains seem to come from the targeted augmentations. But for the astro datasets the ID test acc for astroclassification is better without targeted augmentations. One a new task or dataset, how should one choose the targeted augmentations?\n2. Test-time methods, like test-time augmentation/training also makes use of unlabelled data. These methods aim to adapt to the distribution shift as they occur. Furthermore, some of these pre-training objectives like masked auto-encoding have been used for test-time adaptation [2]. It may be beneficial to pose these methods wrt Connect Later.\n4. Presentation\n    - Sec 4 gives the technical details for creating augmentations before explaining the tasks. It may not be clear what the tasks for Astroclassification and Redshift are about and so the technical details are not easy to understand. I would suggest moving Sec 5 before 4.\n    - In Fig 2, top row, what do the colors mean? Why does augmentation introduce errors?\n    - It may be useful to have additional columns in the main table of results (e.g. Tab 2), that describes what the different methods are. E.g., whether finetuning augmentations are used, and with checks in the rows for the relevant methods.\n\n\n\n\n----\n[1] Diversify Your Vision Datasets with Automatic Diffusion-based Augmentation.

                "value": "This manuscript deals with the domain adaptation problem, i.e., the setting in which there is a domain shift between a source and target domain and where only unlabelled data is available for the target domain. One approach to this problem is to use self-supervised learning using both the source and target domain data, followed by fine-tuning with the labelled source domain data.\n\nThe authors begin with the observation that this approach leads to inconsistent results compared to regular supervised training (ERM). They hypothesize this is because the self-supervised methods learn features that are strongly domain-specific, which means that when the model is fine-tuned the classifier from the last layer might not generalize beyond the source distribution. The authors propose a solution which involves using targeted augmentations (i.e., augmentations that are specifically designed to remove spurious domain-dependent features) during the fine-tuning phase. They show that this improves performance on three different datasets."

At the same time, self-supervised learning has become very popular, but its performance in the context of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is still unclear.\n\nThis paper introduces a new dataset (RedShifts), and contains some encouraging results on two different domains (camera trips and astronomical observations) while performing several relevant ablations (model scale, whether to train the last layer before fine-tuning, strength of pre-training augmentations).\n\nThe paper is relatively easy to read, with good writing and a clear structure."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Overall, I find this paper lacking in a variety of areas:\n\nThe authors' refer several times to Shen et al. (2022). This paper argues that contrastive pre-training is beneficial as long as data augmentations ensure that augmented examples must be more likely to change class or domain than changing both. The authors of this manuscript seem to argue in section 3 that the bad results they observe are explained by a violation of this assumption from Shen et al. (2022). However, this isn't tested rigorously (see section 6 of Shen et al., 2022, for examples on how to evaluate connectivity on real world datasets).\n\nA second shortcoming is that different self-supervised methods were used for the iWildCam-WILDS dataset (SWaV contrastive learning) and the astronomical time-series (masked autoencoding). This makes it hard to draw conclusions from table 1, since it is unclear which differences can be attributed to the use of different pre-training objectives.\n\nThe results on the iWildCam dataset are not very strong (given the means and standard deviations listed, there's a 20% chance that ERM + targeted augs outperforms Connect Later for any run). This leaves the improvements in the astronomical time-series datasets as the stronger proof of Connect Later's performance. But these results are a bit confusing to me: How is it that standard fine-tuning improves in-domain performance (tables 1 and 2)? This suggests to me that these datasets are possibly very small and benefit strongly from the regularization that pre-training provides. In that case, is Connect Later really addressing a domain shift issue? Or is it just addressing a regular overfitting issue? The latter seems plausible given the very small size of the dataset (6,74 objects). I would argue that in order to draw conclusions, the method should be tested on a wider variety of larger datasets.\n\nA baseline that seems to be missing as well is the use of general augmentations during fine-tuning (my understanding is that standard fine-tuning uses no augmentations at all). This would clarify whether it is important to use targeted augmentations during fine-tuning, or whether any form of augmentations would be fine.\n\nOverall, I find the insights that this paper provides limited: It is not surprising to me that targeted augmentations would help with fine-tuning, given that they were shown to help with regular ERM. The bigger question to me is the one raised in section 3: Why does pre-training not always lead to increased OOD performance? This question remains largely unanswered. I think this paper would be better if it provided, for example, (1) clear evidence that the assumptions from Shen et al. (2022) are routinely violated in real-world datasets and commonly used augmentations, (2) a thorough evaluation of how different pre-training techniques (MAEs, contrastive learning) perform in the UDA setting, or (3) strong evidence that targeted augmentations are particularly important compared to general augmentations."
