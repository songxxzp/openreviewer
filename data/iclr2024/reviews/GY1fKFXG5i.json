The challenges they address include (1) dealing with the non-iid nature of tokens, (2) handling unbounded loss, and (3) managing extremely large model parameters. To tackle these issues, the authors propose specific solutions: for (1), leveraging entire sequences to treat tokens as iid; for (2), introducing a smoothed model to manage unbounded loss; and for (3), developing SubLoRA, a novel technique that combines LoRA and subspace training during the training process. Notably, the authors demonstrate the non-vacuous nature of the derived bound for GPT-2.\n\nIn consideration of the fact that this represents the first non-vacuous generalization bound in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), I have assigned a moderately favorable score. It's important to note that I have not conducted an exhaustive investigation to confirm whether this is indeed the inaugural non-vacuous bound, and I am relying on the authors' assertion in this regard.\nMy reasons for not awarding a higher score can be attributed to the following factors:\n\n1. I hold the perspective that the existence of vacuous bounds in LLMs during the pretraining phase might not be of paramount significance.\n2. The authors primarily synthesize existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally novel methods. It should be acknowledged that this does not necessarily translate to incremental progress since discovering these techniques is not a straightforward endeavor. However, a higher rating is withheld due to the absence of groundbreaking or distinctly tailored contributions to LLMs."

However, it seems that the techniques in this paper are not very novel. The methods presented in this paper largely combine existing techniques (e.g., SubLoRA). \n3. The paper claims that tokens exhibit non-iid behavior but resolves this issue by considering entire sequences, which might be considered a somewhat coarse approach.\n\nThe three points stop me from giving a higher score."

These bounds (that depend on empirical risk) are computed for several methods, with the bounds, and the empirical performance is shown to be best for the proposed method."

When it is said top-1 error, do you mean the worst sequence, or the worst token? \n\n**I.I.D. Assumption**\n\t- i.i.d assumption is a very strong assumption\n\t- but then a workaround is found which considers sequences not tokens, but then it's unclear how the parameter L is chosen"

                "value": "**Artifact**\n- It seems the provided code is running the glue suite, and the code involves LoRA, but not subLoRA? And the other folder seems to be from nanoGPT?\n\t- Glue suite seems to be unrelated to the task in paper: token prediction?\n- At first because of the copyright line in the provided file, I was going to make a comment how it seems double blindness of the review is compromised as it seemed the submission was from the Hugging Face Team, but then I realized it is a minor modification of the same file from the Hugging Face Repository\n- Can you please check if the provided code is what you intended to submit? And let me know if I am missing something? And also some rough system specifications on which it can be run?\n\n**Comparison with Other Methods**\n- when comparing LoRA and Subspace (e.g. in figure 1) we see a comparison of train error, but not test error. Is there a reason for that?\n\n**I.I.D Assumption**\n- Can you please comment on why, despite the i.i.d. assumption, these results are still significant?\n\n**Possible Minor Typos / Formatting / Clarity** \n- page 6. 'payed'\n- abbreviation NLL used without definition\n- references need to be reviewed for formatting\n- page 4, second last line, shouldn't it be \"u: = flatten( ...)\" instead of \"LoRA(u) := flatten ( ... )\"\n- page 6, last paragraph says we use \"several\" values for r, giving the impression they are more than two, but the appendix mentions two values {1,4}\n- page 14, second last paragraph: \"Choosing an overall ... \". Please recheck this for clarity.\n\n\nIn summary the only major reservations I have are about the provided code and the i.i.d assumption, to the best of my knowledge. I apologize if I overlooked something important. Please feel free to correct me for any errors I may have made while reviewing; and to address these concerns. Thank you.\n\nMy vote is to for strong accept, conditional on addressing concerns regarding the prototype code."
