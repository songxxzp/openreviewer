Initial condensation refers to the occurrence of weight grouping in the early stages of neural network (NN) training, which has been discussed in previous literature mainly with respect to fully connected NNs. A two-layer CNN is theoretically analyzed and it is shown that initial condensation occurs in one CNN layer with respect to convolutional kernels."

In which exact steps does this analysis differ from the analysis for fully-connected networks?\n    It seems like the analyses have a lot in common.\n 7. Is condensation a good or a bad thing?\n 8. Why are the experiments conducted with networks that attain less than 20% accuracy?\n 9. Does the theoretical setting in the experiment section also have 2 fully-connected layers at the end (as claimed in the experimental setup section)?\n 10. Can the theory be directly applied to adaptive gradient methods, as used in the experiments?\n 11. Does condensation also occur when the last layer is initialised with zeros?\n 12.
