For example, fine-tuning a pretrained model (here, LLMs) to downstream tasks is a widely used approach. And for replanning by feedback, while a larger LLM is improved with the replanning, a smaller one is not, implying that we need some large LLMs, but it is also quite expected that a larger model may yield better performance and a smaller one.\n- The feedback for replanning is based on metadata (i.e., oracle information about what is \"wrong\") of the simulated environments but this may not be always available beyond the benchmark for other downstream tasks (e.g., some tasks might not be able to provide why agents fail at actions). Can this direction be also useful for those cases without the oracle information?\n- The authors conduct experiments based on a subset (30%) of the original datasets but do not provide some significance tests. It might be better to include them in the results (e.g., Figure 2) with different subsets.\n\n\\* Minor\n - The used font looks a bit different from the one used in the original ICLR format.

                "value": "NL to API Component: I am a little bit confused about the need for setting up an NL to API component for the current system. Why can\u2019t the skills provided to the LLM consist of directly executable API calls or actions? Is the concern here that the API calls would be too abstract and arbitrary to be connected to the actual instruction? Can\u2019t you get around it by using meaningful action names (as is the case in classical symbolic planning settings [1]) or provide a description of each action in natural language as part of the environment context?\n\nFailure Reasons: I wish there were a more detailed analysis of how the plans failed and the main results were not reported in terms of mere success rates. Some potential analyses the authors should consider here include things like checking if there were any phenomena akin to invalid preconditions, i.e., a selected low-level controller needed certain state constraints to be met before it was applicable. Similarly, how close were the failed plans to valid plans? Could you have turned them into valid plans by appending a few more actions? Were they moving the environment state closer to the goal state? Was the goal state achieved as an intermediate result and then changed by some future actions?\n\nLack of tests on GPT-4: One shortcoming of the current set of experiments is that it is missing any results that make use of GPT-4 as a planner, which is widely recognized as being one of the most powerful LLMs that are currently available. The reason cited is the unavailability of mechanisms to identify the probability associated with each possible next token. However, as I understand it, the basic planner uses a greedy approach to select the next most likely token. Each selected token is appended to the prompt, and the next token is selected. Isn\u2019t this similar to the basic autoregressive mechanism used by all LLMs, including GPT-4, especially when using low temperatures? You could have forced GPT-4 to only select tokens from the pool of potential skills by careful prompt engineering and some filtering. Even if the mechanism weren\u2019t exactly the same, this would have provided a useful point of comparison on how the state-of-the-art LLM models fair in these benchmark tasks.\n\n[1] Haslum, Patrik, et al.
