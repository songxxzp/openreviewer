The method is shown to outperform previous arts ($\\Pi$GDM, RED-Diff) on some datasets: ImageNet-64/128, and AFHQ-256."

(Limited contribution) As stated in S1, the proposed method boils down to $\\Pi$GDM that uses ODE sampler, rather than the stochastic DDIM sampler ($\\eta = 1.0$) that $\\Pi$GDM uses. The step size derived from Lemma 2 is also another way of stating what was already shown from DDRM and $\\Pi$GDM.\n\n2. (Choice of test dataset) On most of the diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers, testing is performed on two canonical datasets: FFHQ 256$\\times$256 and ImageNet 256$\\times$256. These two datasets are typically more challenging than the datasets that are used in this paper. It is hard to convince the strength of the paper when there is no specific reason to deviate from this standard. The method would be more convincing if the same superiority can be seen in such largely used benchmarks.\n\n3. (Exposition) In the preliminaries, it is unclear why one has to start from *conditional* diffusion models and *conditional* flow models, when at the end of the day, unconditional models will be used to try to sample from the posterior distribution $p(\\mathbf{x}_1|\\mathbf{y})$."

Instead, I would advise to use the term *inverse problems in imaging*, which is a standard term that has been used for decades.\n\n2. Is Algorithm 1 different from $\\Pi$GDM other than the fact that it is an ODE sampler? Specifically, assume that $\\eta = 0.0$ from the $\\Pi$GDM DDIM sampling. Are these two equivalent in this case, given that VP-ODE is used?\n\n3. (Implementation details) It is unclear why the authors trained a class conditional model, where the standard is to use class unconditional models. The former is known to perform better than the latter.\n\n4. Why does VP-ODE perform (marginally) better than OT-ODE? The theory of flow matching models would state otherwise.\n\n5. (pg 9. last paragraph) Did you mean to cite DPS when you mention non-linear observations? PSLD would not be able to solve non-linear inverse problems due to the gluing term used in the paper."
