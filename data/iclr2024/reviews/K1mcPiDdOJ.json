Can you provide a more comprehensive evaluation, including comparisons with state-of-the-art models like ODE-based models and diffusion models, to demonstrate the performance of your model?\n\n2. The paper claims that the CIB approach can mitigate the excessive regularization associated with IB. However, there seems to be a lack of quantitative analysis to substantiate this claim.  It would be beneficial if the authors could provide explicit metrics or criteria to measure the extent of regularization and demonstrate how CIB effectively addresses this issue.\n\n3. Mitigating regularization is a double-edged sword, as it might lead to overfitting, especially in the context of learning temporal dependencies in time series data.  The paper should address how the CIB approach ensures an optimal balance, preventing the model from overly adapting to the training data and subsequently degrading its performance on unseen data.  Is there any empirical evidence or theoretical analysis to showcase this balance?\n\n4. Using MINIST in the illustration of temporal dependency (Figure 1) is dubious compared to other irregular time series datasets (e.g., weather, traffic). It cannot demonstrate how the model handles temporal dependencies between different dimensions in multi-variate situations. How does the CIB approach model handle the multi-variate dependencies exactly?"

Finally, the results are concise and clear to read. It is evident from the results that their proposed method opens very prospective lines for future research in missing data imputation in time series. \n\nFurthermore, the paper holds interest from an information bottleneck perspective in two significant ways. Firstly, it extends the information bottleneck concept to a conditional information bottleneck, representing a novel contribution in its own right. Secondly, the introduction of a fresh objective for VAE-based models to address missing data concerns is noteworthy. The authors follow the standard assumptions for handling missing data using VAEs, such as evaluating the objective on the observations of filling the missing points with zeros. However, the paper sets itself apart not solely due to its new objective based on the conditional information bottleneck but also because of its capacity to generate fresh avenues of research and stimulate discussions during the conference"

As many papers dealing with temporal data, sometimes notation becomes a bit complex and makes the reading more difficult. \n2. I believe more information about the experimental section could be provided. That, is, for HealingMNIST and RotatedMNIST, which kind of CNN-based encoder/decoder architecture is being used; for Physionet, which kind of networks are used? There is no information about this, especially for the proposed method, since for baselines this can be accessed in their referred papers. And this is quite important when asking why the proposed method outperforms any other baseline. This leads me to the following point. \n3. I am a bit hesitant about the superior performance of the proposed method in (almost) every dataset and performance metric. This creates some doubts that will be asked in the question section.\n4. There is no reference for code availability to reproduce the experiments. Will you upload the code to Git Hub or any available repository? This is rather important for the sake of reproducibility. And given that the results are (fairly always) better than baselines, this should be a must-have for this paper. \n5. I find the paper rather novel in terms of the proposal of the CIB objective. However, in terms of the VAE-based model, I believe there is much inspiration coming from GPVAE [1], due to the idea of including an extra kernel to further enhance the learning of the temporal dynamics. Is this the case? Should the authors be more worried about properly referencing this work?\n6. An ablation study should be included to determine the importance of each contribution in the paper. That is, i) how the different terms in the proposed objective influence the optimization ii) how important is it to introduce the kernel \u2014 without the kernel, would the results approach the ones from GPVAE, or does the proposed model still outperform other baselines? I think it is important to analyze each contribution of the paper to obtain a clear and detailed view of the behaviour of the proposed model. \n\n[1] Fortuin, V., Baranchuk, D., R\u00e4tsch, G., & Mandt, S.

In Equation 7, in the denominator, why do you have a summation over X when you don\u2019t have any variable x, just z? This also holds for Equation 9. I believe you mean that you sample from the encoder to get z out of x. However, I think the equation could be improved. \n2. The samples from Equation 4, how are they taken? How many samples? Is the method sensible to the number of samples? Do the results improve by taking more samples? Did you consider the following approaches such as MIWAE? \n3. Why do you always outperform all baselines, in all datasets under any missing data assumption? I find it rather surprising given that you have a loss (Equation 8) composed of three terms, which I believe must be difficult to optimize. Besides, there is not much information about the $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ parameters. How do they influence the optimization? There is no discussion about this. \n4. What do black crosses and black dots represent in Figure 3? I believe dots are observations and crosses missing points, but this is not commented on. \n5. Looking at Figure 3a), for example: how is it possible that HIVAE and GP-VAE obtain such poor results compared to your proposed method? I assume this is the case for HIVAE since it is not designed to deal with temporal data, but for GP-VAE this is very surprising. As described in [2], I would expect this to happen in the missing parts, where the GPVAE would produce a more \u201cmean\u201d solution less correlated to the original signal. However, in the observations, I would expect the GP-VAE to obtain better results. \n6. In Table 3 you have an interesting result. In terms of RMSE, it can be observed that mean imputation (one of the most naive approaches) outperforms any baseline, even state-of-the-art methods. What do you think about this result? As observed in [2], sometimes error metrics are inconclusive when evaluating temporal scenarios. Did you find this behaviour in other datasets? Did you think about the possibility of instead of using missing data randomly or following other mechanisms (which you withdrew from GPVAE and other papers I believe) using missing data in burts or sequences, where actually it is the standard scenario you would find in a temporal scenario such as in healthcare? This could be an interesting point to be analyzed here: check whether the solutions from baselines and proposed methods are more correlated.  \n\n[1] Mattei, P. A., & Frellsen, J. (2019, May).
