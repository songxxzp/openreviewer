                "value": "The paper does not contain any of the experimental results in the main submission. The main text should be self-contained and present at least part of the representative results. Remember that the reviewers are not obligated to look into the supplementary material.\n\nThe current state of writing makes it very hard to grasp the gist of the proposed methodology. Let me elaborate on a few examples:\n* For Section 2, the related work mixes up MCMC methods based on simulating the Langevin diffusion, score function modeling based on Langevin diffusion, and bridge matching. These are very different ideas for solving different problems. Thus, the way this section is written confused me rather than putting the work in the context of previous works.\n* In Section 3.1, a key aspect of the methodology seems to solve a bridge-matching problem with respect to the samples of some MCMC chains. However, I could not find the specifics of the authors\u2019 approach anywhere in the main text. Only after looking at Algorithm 1 in the appendix I found that some loss functions are being minimized. The definition of these loss functions should have been in the main text.\n* For Section 3.2, the authors do not provide enough explanation/motivation/proof as to why the reverse solution of the Feynman-Kac equation is the right conditional expectation. Again, the paper is expected to be self-contained to a certain degree.\n\nFurthermore, I have some concerns about the technical claims of the paper:\n* The paper claims that the proposed methodology \"necessitates fewer assumption since it does not rely on the law of large numbers and the Markov ergodic theorem.\" However, it does rely on a strong assumption: that we are able to solve the PDE! That is, the paper does not contain any proof of the accuracy of the solution of the proposed differential equation. Even if, mathematically, the differential equation's solution is the desired conditional expectation, discretizing and numerically solving this is a completely different story. This is crucial in an MCMC setting since empirically assessing the quality of samples/expectation estimates is very challenging.\n* One of the key motivations seems to be replacing the need for discarding burn-in samples. However, I do not quite understand how this is true when the paper tries to match the output of an MCMC estimator. This will contain non-asymptotic bias that can only be resolved through burn-in. Then wouldn't trying to match this end up inheriting the bias?\n* The paper claims that the method \"enhances efficiency through one-time training.\" However, I do not quite see how this improves anything. Couldn't I run MCMC longer instead of solving a differential equation? In fact, if we assume that solving differential equations indeed provides the right expectation, couldn't MCMC be regarded as an efficient way to solve this equation without involving any solvers? How much faster, precisely, is solving the equation rather than running MCMC? \n\nLastly, the idea of connecting MCMC expectation estimators with partial differential equations is not new [1-4], and a literature is already building around it. While the approaches of these works are different, and I'm not saying that this work lacks novelty in that regard, I believe these works actually do what the paper seems to have attempted to do: post-process the output of an MCMC algorithm to improve the performance of the expectation estimator. Furthermore, they come with asymptotic and non-asymptotic consistency guarantees and work incredibly well in practice! Thus, I believe the paper should have compared and discussed these methods.\n\n### References\nDisclaimer: I am not the author nor affiliated with any of the papers below.\n1.

It is said that standard MCMC approaches suffer from long burn-in period, but the proposed approach requires training of neural network models at both the diffusion bridge model stage and the PDE solving stage, which to me seems a much higher cost.\n2. The claim of reduced variance from the proposed approach seems not supported, and the approximations due to imperfect training of neural networks, discretization of PDE, etc, would cause a systematic bias towards the computed expectation. How much the bias is, and whether it can be bounded are also not discussed.\n3. While it is claimed that the proposed approach can reduce the curse of dimensionality, the numerical experiments are all very low-dimensional examples. A simple Metropolis-Hastings/Gibbs sampler, or even an accept/reject or importance sampler could give very efficient and stable estimates of expectations.\n4. Most MCMC samplers are targeted for generating samples from the distribution, which could be used for posterior inference etc. The proposed approach, however, can only be used to compute the expectation of one function. Say we want to compute the posterior mean, posterior variance and a 95\\% posterior credible interval, then the proposed approach have to be used repeatedly for each quantity, while standard MCMC approaches only require one sampling chain.\n\nI would be willing to increase the rating if any of the above concerns could be addressed or the claimed advantage of the method could be really proven through solid theoretical results or numerical experiments (e.g. in a high-dimensional Ising model or some serious Bayesian models)."

Lack of clarity**\n\nI'm afraid this work is not ready for publication purely on the basis of presentation alone. \n\n* Most of the text is much too informal/needs to be more precise; and having the pseudo code only in the appendix is making this problem worse.\n* Section 2 cites a number of works in which diffusions are employed in disparate contexts (summarising these works as discussing the same \"diffusion model\" seems strange).\n* Section 3.1 is a mess: I have now read it multiple times but I am still not sure which methods are actually used to find the parameters of the diffusion process and which methods are just \"alternative\" possibilities that the authors are not actually implementing. \n* There are many key terms whose lack of explanation/definition makes the paper difficult to understand, \"sample collection process\", \"well-sampled points\", \"high-quality samples\", \"partial observations\", \"resampling\", \"moments\" (from the context, I think the authors mean something like \"time steps\"), \"RelMeanEst\" ...\n* The text reads like a first draft with numerous typos, randomly capitalised words, some notation left undefined (or only defined in the appendix).\n* Similarly, the references/bibliography is full of errors/typos.\n* The headings in the tables in the appendix make it very difficult to understand what is actually being shown there.\n\n**2. Lack of substantiation of claims**\n\nThe list of contributions on Page 2 makes some very strong claims. Among these are that the proposed methodology \n* \"can estimate expectations without succumbing to the limitations imposed by thecurse of dimensionality\";\n* \"often exhibits superior efficiency\" (compared to what?);\n* \"leads to a more efficient utilization of Markov chains. Notably, it necessitates fewer assumptions since it does not rely on the law of large numbers and the Markov ergodic theorem\".\n\nAs far as I can tell, the manuscript does not actually provide convincing evidence in support of these claims. Indeed, the proposed methodology likely introduces approximation errors at numerous stages because\n\n* the constructed diffusion only *approximately* admits $P$ as stationary distribution;\n*  sample paths generated from the diffusion (which are needed for approximately finding the solution of the Feynman--Kac formula) suffer from discretisation error;\n* the solution of the Feynman--Kac formula is only approximated via deep learning."

However, can the authors demonstrate that their approach (which incurs substantial additional computations needed for training the SDE parameters and solving the PDE) outperforms running the MCMC chain for just a while longer?"
