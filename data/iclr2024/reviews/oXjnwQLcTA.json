                "value": "This paper formulates the offline goal conditioned reinforcement leanring (GCRL) problem as an occupancy matching problem and leverages the popular DICE methods to transform this problem into an objective that can be exclusively trained on offline dataset. Specifically, they adopts ValueDICE[1]-like method for this reformulation. The authors argue that by doing so, the offline GCRL problem can be solved without necessitating a well-trained discriminator. Instead, it learns unnormalized densities or scores that allow it to produce optimal goal-reaching policies, greatly enhancing the training results. In addition, this paper does not directly optimize the objectives derived from the DICE reformulation (Eq. 9), but adopts IQL[2] to optimize some surrogate objectives (Eq. 10-12). From my perspective, this approach mitigates the side-effect of residual learning in Eq. 9 since the surrogate objective in Eq. 11 is optimized via semi-gradient, which is believed to enjoy better performances than residual learning. This paper conducts some experiments on low-dimensional and image-based tasks to support the effectiveness of the proposed method, and also carries out some ablation stuidies on stochastic environments with varied noise levels.\n\n[1] Imitation Learning via Off-Policy Distribution Matching, ICLR 2020\n\n[2] Offline Reinforcement Learning with Implicit Q-Learning, ICLR 2022"

The target goal-transition distribution $q(s,a,g)$ defined in Section 3.1 might not be a valid discounted visitation distribution that fulfills the Bellman-flow constraint. Therefore, this suggests that the  occupancy matching problem in Eq. 4 may not be appropriately formulated.\n\n## Experiment\n2. This paper optimizes surrogate objectives using IQL[2] rather than directly solving the objective derived from DICE reformulation, but does not provide explainations for this choice. Moreover, this paper does not conduct enough ablation studies on this aspect. It raises a question about the performance of GoFAR using this same technique. In my view, optimizing the surrogate objectives in Eq. 10-12 can mitigate the side-effect of residual learning in Eq. 9. Therefore, GoFAR may also obtain large performance gains using the IQL tricks.\n3. Given that GoFAR does not employ IQL surrogate objectives, I cannot ensure the comparison in Figure 2 is fair. It would be more fair if the authors could also apply this technique to GoFAR and compare it against GoFAR using this approach.\n\n## Others\n4. Some potential overclaims. Section 3.1 is essentially an extension of the conclusion of GoFAR[3] from state-occupancy matching to state-action-occupancy matching. The authors should provide more discussions on the relationships with GoFAR. Although they have made statements like \"Proposition 1 extends the insights of formulating GCRL as an imitation learning problem from Ma et al. for goal-transition distributions when matching state-action-goal visitations\", this similarity should be made clearer.\n5. The Problem Formulation section (Section 2) is largely similar to the one in GoFAR[3] paper, with only minor rewording. In my view, this section should be reorganized or rewording a lot to avoid potential plagiarism."

The difference is that GoFAR is formulated as a V-DICE (learn V and perform goal-conditioned state occupancy matching) and does not use HER; while this paper adopts Q-DICE (learn both Q and $\\pi$ by solving a max-min problem, and performs goal-conditioned state-action occupancy matching) and uses HER to generate desirable goal-reaching data ($q(s,a,g)$). The tricky part is that the final practical algorithm is essentially a goal-conditioned version of in-sample learning algorithm which bears lots of similarities with methods like IQL[2], SQL/EQL[3], and XQL[4]. Although such in-sample learning algorithms like SQL/EQL and XQL have been show to have some connection with DICE-based methods, there are some important distinctions. There are some noticeable theoretical gaps here. The proposed method has a number of strange design choices and the algorithm development is not very principled in several places.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There are several key weaknesses in the paper.\n- The problem setting and Section 3.1 largely follow GoFAR[1] with minor changes. A key motivation from the authors is that methods like GOFAR need an unstable discriminator-based construction. However, this does not really hold. As in the GoFAR paper[1], their authors clearly mentioned in the paper that the discriminator can be bypassed by using the reward in the dataset.\n- Although using HER to generate augmented goal-transition samples could potentially improve distribution coverage and may contribute to certain level performance improvement. However, as discussed in GoFAR, using HER could also lead to sensitive hyperparameter tuning and suffer from hindsight bias.\n- The biggest problem of this paper is the gap between theoretical derivation and the practical algorithm. Based on the augmented samples from HER, the proposed method constructs a goal-conditioned Q-DICE objective which needs to solve a max-$\\pi$ and min-$S$ (analogous to Q function in typical Q-DICE algorithm like AlgaeDICE[5]). This actually caused some stability issues due to extracting $\\pi$ through the max-min optimization problem. Hence the practical algorithm directly jumps to an in-sample learning framework which is similar to IQL[2], SQL/EQL[3], and XQL[4]. Although there are some connections between the DICE-based method and previous in-sample learning methods, there are also some distinctions. An apparent difference is that the DICE-based method requires minimizing $S$ (analogous to Q in other Q-DICE methods) in the first term of Eq.(9) using samples from initial states $d_0$, while in in-sample learning algorithms, this can be sampled from the whole dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ (Eq.(10)). Second, DICE-based method only learn Q (similar to S in this paper) or V, while the previous in-sample learning algorithms learn both Q and V. In my opinion, the paper starts with a DICE formulation and goes a long way to turn it into a non-DICE algorithm. If the authors check the SQL/EQL[3] paper, a more straightforward approach will be starting with its implicit value regularization framework and designing a proper, goal-conditioned regularization function $f$, which will provide a neat and more principled algorithm.\n- The proposed algorithm has many hyperparameters, e.g. $\\tau$ in Eq.(10), $\\beta$ in Eq.(11), and $\\alpha$ in Eq.(12). The paper conducts heavy tuning to obtain the best performance. First of all, for an offline RL algorithm, introducing too many hyperparameters and requiring heavy parameter tuning is an extremely bad practice. In practical offline RL applications, it is almost impossible to evaluate or tune model parameters given restricted access to the real environment. In practice, no one will use an offline RL algorithm if it needs careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve good performance.\n\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Ma, J. Y., et al.

In this case, although the framework does not have an explicit discriminator, the S-function actually plays the role of a discriminator. What's more, the proposed method requires two networks, S and M, to learn the optimal policy, while many works only require a network (such as contrastive RL). This implies that the proposed method has more parameters and computational complexity.\nAnother weakness is that it is unclear how much of the performance gain comes from each component.
