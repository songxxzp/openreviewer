The authors provide applications of MAESTRO to various layer types in CNNs, FC, and Transformers. \n\nThe paper is easy to understand and is well-structured.

It might be helpful to provide a better illustration for the Ordered Dropout process (it is challenging to understand it with symbols without any reference in the figure caption. In current form, it is assumed that the readers will be familiar with OD). Since MAESTRO provides layer-wise decomposition and is generally applicable to various DNN layers, it might be useful to incorporate the various layer types of the DNN network (Sec 3.2) in Figure 1 as an overall summary of the proposed work and its applicability."

Its effectiveness, however, is primarily demonstrated through toy architectures and datasets, such as ResNet18 and Cifar10. For the method to gain practical and impactful validation, I recommend conducting additional experiments on more complex datasets like ImageNet to substantiate its superiority.\n\n- Building on the previous point, there are alternative methods that report better accuracy with more compact architectures. For instance, the OTOv2 framework:\n\nChen, Tianyi, et al. \"Only train once: A one-shot neural network training and pruning framework.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 19637-19651.\n\nIt structurally prunes the model during training (hence still training efficient), and it achieves a 93.3% accuracy with only 0.55M parameters on Cifar10 using VGG16. This is in contrast to the 93.10% accuracy with 2.20M parameters reported by the proposed method. This comparison casts doubt on the practical utility and the advantages of the low-rank based method presented."
