It doesn't clarify how the model makes decisions or whether it reveals any general biases the model has learned. The only thing I can see from here is how close two models are. \n\n2- Although the authors claim that the proposed approach can be used with any model, it appears that this may not be the case. It's unclear which layer to encode, and if we attempt to encode multiple layers, we would need different encoders due to varying input sizes. Even with the option of ReLU in section 5.3, it may be impossible for large networks. Representing an entire large network with a single-layer network doesn't seem feasible.\n\n3- In practice, users typically train a network for a specific task they don't train hundreds of networks. Consequently, it's unclear how the encoder can be trained with very few weights.\n\nMinor formatting issues:\n\n1- In the related work section, change \"Indeed\" to \"indeed\" in the sentence, \"Those latent variables are indeed a concise representation.\"\n\n2- In Section 4.1, tag the figure number instead of writing \"Figure\" so that readers can identify which figure you are referring to.\n\n3- When tagging figures, use \"Fig. 1\" instead of writing \"[1]\" for better clarity."

Can we use only one of them, such as either the \"unit-wise\" meta-autoencoder or the \"inter-unit\" meta-autoencoder only?"
