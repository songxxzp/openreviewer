                "value": "- The perhaps biggest weakness with this paper is the writing.\n  - This paper starts by raising two possible drawbacks of shallow alignment methods: (i) converge fast but perform worse. (ii) weak visual understanding ability, expecially hallucination. However, both these two disadvantages proposed by the authors are just **hypothesises**, not **compelling** nor **conclusive**. First, the performance gap between BLIP-2 and PaLI-X cames from several possible differences between two framework (e.g., the visual encoder size, the way that visual encoder is pre-trained by). And both MiniGPT-4 and LLAVA have extremely little trainable parameters in the alignment between visual features and language features.\n  - Some blanket statements are used. For instance, the author claims that NLP ability is weakened when jointly train the language model in image-text training. However, there are some evidences show that jointly training can benefit both vision task as well as language task, at least in some aspect (e.g., [1]).\n  - The motivations and starting points are inconsistent with the experiments. In other words, despite the strong performance, the ablation studies cannot demonstrate that two problems of shallow alignment raised by the writers are well resolved. The ablation studies in Table 6 can prove the effectiveness of CogVLM design. But these numbers cannot prove that deep alignment is better than and solves the issues of shallow alignment, due to the results of shallow alignment method with larger visual encoder (same parameters as vision encoder + vision adapter) are remain unknown.\n- Section 2.2 mentions that CogVLM is trained via two-stage process, with 120K and 60K steps respectively. The ablation studies in Table 6 are trained for just 6K steps. However, despite with much fewer iterations, the performance gap between ablation model and the final model is not that significant (e.g., in Table 6, CogVLM achieves 142.8 COCO CIDEr, only ~4 CIDEr score less that the results in Table 3). So does this phenomenone implies that too much iterations in the two-stage training process are unnecessary?\n- The visual expert in CogVLM includes FFNs in both attention block and FFN block. Which one is more important for better performance?\n\n[1] Tu, Haoqin, et al. \"Sight Beyond Text: Multi-Modal Training Enhances LLMs in Truthfulness and Ethics.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.07120 (2023)."

For example, a lot of BERT-style models exploit dense interactions. Second, it is really hard to capture which part is really making the main contribution to the final performance. There are many confounding factors such as the number and type of pretraining data, the instruction-tuning data, different architecture designs, and finetuning strategies. According to Table 6, I can hardly see a clear improvement brought by the introduced new VE modules. The authors start with some good motivation for building more intimate interaction between vision and language, but it finally becomes the emphasis of the benefit of scaling up.\n\nAnother missed piece of this work is what we can learn from this work. The state-of-the-art performance should be appreciated. But from the paper, I can hardly tell what the researchers should proceed to further improve the performance. Do we need better model design, or more data and computations? As mentioned in the paper, the authors also used some in-house data, which I guess cannot be released to the public. Given the barrier of reproducing the reported results and also the limited insights delivered by this work, I am sharing a huge concern regarding the current trend of building multimodal LLMs manifested by this work or other related ones."
