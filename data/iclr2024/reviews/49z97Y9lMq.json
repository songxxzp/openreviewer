Recently, the OT community addresses gained ample interest in OT metrics on non-Eculean spaces. This paper investigates OT between measures supported on the unit circle, aka circular probability measures. The paper starts with a background on circular OT by defining probability measures with 1-periodicity. This gives the CDF function with respect to a reference point. Proposition 2.3 is quite interesting since it expresses the COT between circular probability as an optimization problem on the real line by searching cutting points $x_{cut} \\in [0,1)$. Using classical optimal transport on the real line, we can construct the Monge map between data points on the circular probability measures. \n\nThis work proposes LCOT a new discrepancy between circular probability measures, allowing to embedding the origin measures by computing their Monge map with respect to a fixed reference measure (uniform or Lebesgue measure). If the cost function is the $p$-power of the absolute value, then LCOT is a proper distance and coincides with the $L_p$ norm on the unit circle endowed with the reference measure."

Probably, the result is trivial but I think it deserves to be proved.\n- As it can be seen in Figure 4, the LCOT with non-uniform reference measure is slower than the LCOT-Uniform. Is there any constant depending on the choice of the reference measure that can be added to the complexity of LCOT?\n- The experiments are conducted on simulated data, I think the application of LCOT in real data in one of the detailed domains (see Paragraph 2 in the introduction) would add more importance to this approach.
