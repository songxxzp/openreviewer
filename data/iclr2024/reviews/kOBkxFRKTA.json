One could perform it as follows: with some interval, a fraction of weights with the smallest magnitude among the group of M consecutive weights is dropped and the same fraction with high gradient magnitude is regrown. Indeed, the difference from original RigL is that the space of possible updates is much more constrained - i.e. for 2:4 sparsity one can prune a single non-zero weight inside the group of 4 and regrow one among the zeros. Likely, such strategy would perform poorly, but this comparison would motivate the necessity for constant fan-in sparsity. The other alternative is RigL with blocked sparsity that prunes whole groups of consecutive `block_size` weights. This sparsity pattern is known to be more CPU-speedup friendly compared to unstructured sparsity. \n\nMethod lacks comparison with dedicated inference engines that leverage sparsity. DeepSparse engine [1] achieves significant speed-ups for unstructured sparsity, especially on Intel CPUs. \n\n*Minor* In the Appendix E plots w/o ablation seem to be absent on Figure 7. \n\n---\n[1] https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse"

Indeed, it is hardly possible to achieve linear speed-up, but I would expect at most saturation for high N:M sparsity. \n\nHow well does the method perform when combined with quantization? One is expected to achieve even higher speed-ups for sparse+8bit quantized model.  \n\nHow much does the method explore new connections compared to RigL? Would be interesting to compare some measure similar to In-Time Over-Parameterization, introduced in [1] for RigL and SRigL. \n\n---\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02887"

While the benefit of sparse models at inference time is obvious, the benefit of sparsifying models at training time (that reach the same generalization error) should be either faster training times or lower memory footprint. The authors show no evidence that SRigL trains models faster than dense-to-sparse methods such as SR-STE.

                "value": "1. The research topic of structured DST is timely and important for the ML community. With the popularity of LTH and DST, sparse neural networks have received upsurging attention due to its promising capacity to reduce training/inference costs while maintaining the original performance of dense counterparts. However, the benefits of sparse NNs can largely constraint by the limited support from common hardware - GPUs. Research works to improve the progress of this direction make significant contributions to the community.  \n\n2. This paper provides a comprehensive and precise related work that covers the most state-of-the-art structured/unstructured sparse training approaches. I very much appreciate such rich related works that provide enough credits and credits to previous works. \n\n3. The detailed step of SRigL in Section 3 provides a good overview to understand the methodology. \n\n4. SRigL is able to find small-sparse NNs that enjoy better real-world wall-clock for online inference than structured (SRigL with only neuron ablation) and unstructured NNs. \n\n5. Compared with N:M sparsity, SRigL enjoys uniform layer-wise sparsity, which is more desirable for performance."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "(1) Partial of the ideas used in SRigL has some certain levels of overlaps with the previous work (Chase: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19454.pdf). For instance, Chase also uncovers that a large proportion of channels (termed sparse amenable channels) tend to be sparse during DST. They also perform channel pruning to produce a mixture of structured and unstructured sparsity at the end of training. It is better to clarify the difference and similarity between Chase and SRigL, even though Chase does not introduce the hardware-friendly constant fan-in sparsity for the unstructured part. \n\n(2) Can SRigL also accelerate the training process for the online inference, with real-world wall-clock saving?\n\n(3)  In many cases in Table 1 and 3, SRigL w/ ablation even outperforms SRigL w/o ablation, which is a bit counter-intuitive. Cause SRigL w/ ablation essentially produces a smaller-sparse model if I understand correctly, which would decrease the model capacity. Can the authors elaborate more about this? Does  SRigL w/o ablation means only pruning these dean channels without weight regrowing?"

            "questions": {
                "value": "(1) What is the technical difference between SRigL and Chase? \n\n(2) Can SRigL also accelerate the training process for the online inference, with real-world wall-clock saving? Moreover, I noticed that the Constant Fan-in sparsity can be accelerated by GPUs with some custom CUDA implementation, such as Schultheis & Babbar (2023). I am wondering how difficult to make SRigL accelerated by GPUs using the CUDA implementation provided by Schultheis & Babbar (2023). \n\n(3) Why SRigL w/ ablation outperforms SRigL w/o ablation? I suppose that SRigL w/o ablation is essentially the unstructured version of RigL. \n\n(4) Since the real-world clock-time is measured on CPU. I am wondering how different it is to implement GPU kernel to support SRigL in common GPUs?\n\nOverall, I think this paper is a good asset and I am willing to increase my score if the above weaknesses can be resolved."
