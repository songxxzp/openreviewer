Previous papers only consider either the transductive setting or the inductive setting with a rejection option (but not both). This paper exploits the benefits of both settings to have a better theoretical sample complexity and better empirical robustness (than comparing papers). Moreover, the paper proposes a robust learning algorithm and an attack algorithm for the new transductive setting along with a rejection. The efficacy of the defense and attack algorithms are demonstrated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 (along with multiple baselines)."

But, in Section 4, I think it would be better if this paper can show error bounds for the other two baseline settings. \n\nSignificance: This new view on settings on adversarial robustness could encourage some interesting ideas.

In particular, in the transductive setting, it is fine to achieve robustness on a given test set. Thus, as long as we can find an upper bound of max in (2) (which can be done via known certified robustness methods), this can be leveraged to choosing a threshold for the selective classifier, which provides 100% robustness accuracy. Then, the remaining issue is how to reduce the false rejection rate, which is equivalent to making the upper bound tighter. In this regard, proposing a method to learn a robust classifier in the transductive setting with a rejection option may not add any novelty to advance the adversarial robustness research. I want to hear any opinion that considering transductive+rejection can potentially trigger to introduce interesting methods to advance adversarial robustness. \n\nIn the following, I have minor editorial comments.\n* Page 3, \u201cRejection.\u201d: \\mathbb{R} is not defined. \n* Page 5, \u201cProof Sketch\u201d: R is not defined.\n* Section 4. It would be better to show bounds for inductive-only and transductive-only to clearly contrast the benefit of Theorem 4.1."

In the sense that both the model studied and the techniques used are a combination of previous models and techniques used in prior work (Montasser et al., 2021, Goldwasser et al., 2020, Tramer 2022). Moreover, the quantitative sample complexity bounds obtained in this paper exactly match the bounds obtained in Montasser et al., 2021, with the only difference being an improvement in the soundness condition as indicated in Table 1. Which translates to an improvement on the distributional assumption of \"robust realizability\" OPT_{U^{2/3}} = 0 (vs. OPT_{U^2}=0). This is an interesting difference from the prior results of (Montasser et al., 2021), but it is not clear from this paper whether this difference is inherent / fundamental, or merely just a limitation of the techniques. \n\nIn fact, the work of Tramer 2022, suggests that in the inductive setting, there is an equivalence between the problem of robustly classifying adversarial examples and the problem of abstaining on adversarial examples (with some difference in radius of perturbation sets). And the results in this paper would be more convincing/stronger if the paper proves/disproves whether a similar equivalence holds in the transductive setting."
