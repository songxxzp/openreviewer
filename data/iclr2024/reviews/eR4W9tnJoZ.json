Grounded in the understanding that long-duration decisions are the cumulative result of numerous micro-decisions, the author dissects the final seconds of an e-commerce purchase into multiple stimuli. Subsequently, the author introduces a four-point prompt strategy, informed by the outcomes of this analysis. After that, to validate the efficacy of this prompt strategy, the author conducted a series of experiments."

It offers valuable insights into the application of neuroscientifically designed content to enhance ad click-through rates. The paper astutely recognizes the promise of leveraging Generative AI for this purpose. Building upon this foundation, the author thoughtfully presents four distinct prompt strategies and supports them with well-structured experiments, thus substantiating the validity of their approach."

As outlined in the paper, the experiments are limited to a single product tested on a sample of 236 participants. Given the potential applicability of this technique to a wide range of products, the scope of experimentation appears somewhat narrow. Expanding the experiment set to encompass a more diverse array of products would strengthen the paper's claims.\n\nAdditionally, the manual design of prompts by the author may not be a scalable solution when considering the need for ad design across a vast array of products. Further exploration of automated or semi-automated prompt generation methods could enhance the paper's practicality and applicability in real-world scenarios."

Overall, I think that this work has the potential to inform various interested stakeholders, including advertisers, policymakers, and social media operators. Also, I like the paper\u2019s approach that aims to leverage the power of Generative AI (particularly ChatGPT) to generate content based on principles obtained from the neuroscience field."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My main concerns with the paper are related to the framework\u2019s evaluation. I believe that the evaluation is quite limited and simplistic, given that the sample of the recruited participants is biased (the overwhelming majority being from India) and the evaluation focuses on only two products. I suggest that the authors explain and motivate how they perform the user recruitment procedure and the reason why they selected the two products. Overall, given these limitations, it\u2019s unclear whether the paper\u2019s results are generalizable.\n\nAdditionally, the paper fails to explain how this study is different from previous efforts that aim to understand the use of neuromarketing methods without the use of Generative AI to create the ad creatives. The presented framework can also be applied by people to generate ad creatives, so its unclear if the novelty of this work lies in the formulation/use of the framework or the combination of the framework with Generative AI models like ChatGPT. I suggest to the authors to better contextualize their work and better explain the novelty of this work. \n\nAlso, the paper does not explain how the envisioned framework will be applied in practice. The paper\u2019s evaluation defines a set of prompts that are very specific to the products that are studied and generates creatives that are then subsequently used to compare the user perceptions vs. ad creatives that simply show the product with a white background. Overall, it\u2019s unclear on whether the envisioned framework can be applied in practice without great input and effort from experts that will guide the generation of the ad creatives. \n\nIn addition, there is a disconnection between the motivation of the work and the framework/evaluation. The framework does not account for user personalization, which is an important aspect when considering the ad ecosystem. So I am wondering how the paper is planning to incorporate user personalization in this framework and how Generative AI models can assist in this, especially when considering the privacy concerns that may arise from sharing user-specific data with companies that offer LLM solutions (e.g., OpenAI).\n\nTo summarize, I believe that this work is interesting and important, however, at this stage, I believe that the paper is not ready for publication. In addition to the above concerns, I would like to make the following suggestions to the authors (mainly minor issues):\n1. There are a couple of references listed as Anonymous, when they are not Anonymous so I suggest fixing these issues.\n2. Consider not using pie charts for the evaluation results, given that it is one of the worst visualization methods."

How is this study different from previous efforts studying the use of neuromarketing methods vs. plain advertisements like the ones shown to the participants (plain background with the product in the middle)? Is the novelty of the work the use of ChatGPT to generate the ad creatives?"
