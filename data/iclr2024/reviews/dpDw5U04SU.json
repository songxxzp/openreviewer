Then it's shown that when uniform approximation is considered, the minimum width is at least $d_y+1$ when $d_x\\le d_y\\le 2d_x$, implying a dichotomy between $L^p$ and uniform approximation."

Suppose that we are looking for universal approximators in $C(X,\\mathbb{R}^{d_Y})$  implementable by MLPs with ReLU-Like activation function and of bounded widths.  How do you expect that the metric entropy/capacity of $X$ will impact the minimum width?\n\n\nFor instance, if $X=\\{x_0\\}$ is a singleton and $d_Y=1$, then clearly the width $\\min\\{d_X,d_Y,2\\}$ is suboptimal since the class since the class\n$$\n\\{ x\\mapsto a\\operatorname{ReLU}(1\\cdot (x+b)):\\, a\\in \\mathbb{R} ,\\, b:= -x_0 + 1\\}\n$$\nis universal in $C(X,\\mathbb{R})$.  So I guess there is room for improvement for general $X$.  (The same question applies to the case where $d_X=0$ and $d_Y=1$, in which case the minimum width is\n$$\n1 < \\max\\{d_X,d_Y,2\\}=\\max\\{0,1,2\\}=2.\n$$\n\n\n----\n\nWhat's your intuition on how the metric entropy of $X$ appears into the estimate?  \n\n\nI thought about the case where $X=\\{-1,1\\}$ but minimal width seems to apply there also.  What am I missing?\n\n\n\n----\n\n** 2) Why not note more general implications?**\n\nPerhaps I missed it, but it could be worth noting that your results also imply the minimal widths for universality/density in $C(\\mathbb{R}^{d_X},\\mathbb{R}^{d_Y})$ in the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets.  This is because of the extension and normalization arguments as in the proof of Proposition 3.10 [1] or in the proof of Proposition 53 [2], which allows one reduce the problem of universality in $C([0,1]^{d_X},\\mathbb{R}^{d_Y})$.  I.e. using either of the Tiezte or McShane extension theorems\n\n\n** 3) Improving Minimal Width Estimates for general nonlinearities**\n\nIn [5], the authors just recently showed that most MLPs with standard and continuous activation functions can approximately implement and MLP with ReLU activation function using roughly the same depth, width, and number of parameters.  I was wondering, unless I am missing something, why not use their results to sharpen your statement for general continuous activation functions?\n\n- References -\n\n[1] Acciaio, Beatrice, Anastasis Kratsios, and Gudmund Pammer. \"Designing universal causal deep learning models: The geometric (Hyper) transformer.\" Mathematical Finance (2023).\n\n[2] Kratsios, Anastasis, and L\u00e9onie Papon. \"Universal approximation theorems for differentiable geometric deep learning.\" The Journal of Machine Learning Research 23, no. 1 (2022): 8896-8968.\n\n[3] Arenas, Francisco Garc\u00eda, and Mar\u00eda Luz Puertas. \"Tietze's extension theorem.\" Divulgaciones Matem\u00e1ticas 10, no. 1 (2002): 63-78.\n\n[4] Beer, Gerald. \"McShane\u2019s extension theorem revisited.\" Vietnam Journal of Mathematics 48, no. 2 (2020): 237-246.\n\n[5] Zhang, Shijun, Jianfeng Lu, and Hongkai Zhao. \"Deep Network Approximation: Beyond ReLU to Diverse Activation Functions.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.06555 (2023)."

This paper only generalizes Leaky-RELU to RELU-LIKE activations (e.g., RELU, GELU, SOFTPLUS), and derives the same result. I think this makes the contribution of this paper incremental. Also, It would be more interesting if the authors could study the exact minimum width for more architectures used in practice. Furthermore, the technical part is not very deep and mostly based on the technical results from previous papers such as (Cai, 2023).
