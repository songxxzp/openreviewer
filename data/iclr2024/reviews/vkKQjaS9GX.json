Similarly, for the \"information-based diversity\" and the \"proposed diversity\".  \n\nSimilarly, there are many equations in section 3 that are claimed to be related, but the relationships are never proven or stated formally. Where they are formal, they appear to be incorrect. For instance, equation 3 claims a direct correspondence between the KL divergence and a function approximator, which would not be true for a random neural network.  It's not clear how this function approximator factors into equation 2 since neither KL divergence nor the function approximator are listed in equation 2.\n\nThere are also many references to nitty-gritty details of other methods which are never introduced or made explicit enough to track down. For instance, the sentence before equation 5 states that it removes the need for an indicator variable, but it's not clear why that would otherwise have been needed.\n\n\nA related issue to the lack of clarity is the lack of motivation. For instance, equation 2 appears quite arbitrary and is not really introduced. The justification comes later when it is claimed that it is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the steady-state distribution but is easier to compute. If that is true, then \"maximizing the entropy of the steady state distribution\" should be the measure, and this should be later introduced as a way of more easily computing it.\n\nSimilarly, there is a claim in the introduction that having more policies helps robustness, but it is not clear why that would be."

In practical terms, optimizing the measure involves augmenting the environmental reward with an intrinsic reward and employing any conventional RL algorithm. The authors contrast their approach with the existing diverse RL methods based on mutual-information maximization and use of successor features. Experiments in grid-world environment and MuJoCo continuous control locomotion environments indicate that the proposed method generates diverse policies that are more robust to environmental perturbations, compared to the baseline methods."
