It's worth considering whether dynamic-length sampling is necessary or if equal-length sampling would suffice. Furthermore, clarity is needed on how they determine different lengths for various sampling samples. Additionally, the claim that the proposed Positional Encoding is \"specifically designed for time series data\" appears overstated, as it resembles the positional encoding used in the vanilla Transformer and its variants seen in other TSF Transformers like Informer or Autoformer.\n\n2. Section 3.2\n\nThe choice of MSE loss as the reward function raises questions. It's unclear why an MSE-based reward ensures effective learning of abrupt changes rather than favoring smoother results, which could lead to lower overall MSE. Providing a more detailed rationale for this choice would be beneficial. Additionally, while the authors introduce reward sampling as a solution to overfitting, its operation and how it addresses overfitting remain unclear.\n\n3.
