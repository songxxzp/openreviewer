However, there are several similarly simple (in terms of parameters) approaches introduced in [1], which the authors themselves reference when proposing $p$-norm tuning, which are not compared to in the main results of the paper. As a result, it is difficult to determine how much of a benefit there really is from the proposed $p$-norm tuning.\n2. **Discussion of related work on calibration.** While the authors do a good job of discussing prior work on selective classification, there is very little discussion of work on post-training calibration methods. Namely, I think the work would benefit from discussion of modifications to TS/related strategies with more justification for why comparing $p$-norm normalization with vanilla TS is sufficient for making their points.\n\n## Minor Comments\n- Typo on page 8 s/\"Logits Marging\"/\"Logits Margin\"\n- Table 7 in the Appendix (with the comprehensive results) could be presented better.\n\n## Recommendation\nWhile I have some reservations about the novelty of the methods in the work, I think there are several useful ideas (NAURC) and insights in the paper. Particularly, I find the data-efficiency observations to be of note (as discussed in Appendix E and at the top of page 8 of the main paper), and would have liked to see more related discussion in the main paper - this seems to be a very useful attribute and good point of comparison. As a result, I lean accept for this paper and recommend **weak accept**."

As long as we do TS on held-out calibration/validation data, it is certainly still possible that any metric could be worse on test data, unless I'm misunderstanding what the authors mean by MSP-TS here.\n- What is the best choice of $p$ found by tuning $p$-norm? It would be useful to include this in the main discussion, and whether there is actually some significant benefit to tuning $p$ instead of just using $p = 2$.\n- In Table 3, it would be useful to include error bounds (like 1 std range) since you are reporting averages across all models here to better get a sense of the improvement."

Instead, it utilizes a validation set to select the appropriate type of norm. However, the benefits of this process are challenging to quantify, and it's unclear how impactful they may be. The authors have not conducted a corresponding ablation study to demonstrate that the chosen norm is indeed superior to a p optimized through selection. 2) The referenced paper introduces logit normalization during training-time, whereas this study applies it as a post-hoc measure. The amount of novelty this aspect brings is somewhat limited.  \n\nQuality: There's inconsistency in the performance metrics used in the experiments, with initial methods based on NAURC and subsequent ones relying on SAC, without offering a comparative analysis across all metrics in the appendix. This lack of uniformity casts doubt on the results' consistency and the experiment's overall reliability.\n\nClarity: The paper could be significantly improved by providing more intuition/motivation and explaining the rationale behind methodological choices. For instance, the reasons why p-norm would perform effectively in selective classification are not well-articulated. The paper references Wei et al. (2022) but does not provide adequate context for readers less familiar with this work, compromising the clarity of the research. \n\nSignificance: The research's significance is limited, as it doesn't introduce considerable challenges beyond what is already known from the application of logit normalization to selective classification. Furthermore, intriguing findings, like those depicted in Figure 11, are not sufficiently highlighted or explained in the main text, representing a missed opportunity to underscore potential novel insights. The reasons behind the inability of high-confidence models to enhance selective classification remain unexplored, leaving gaps in understanding."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1) What is the intuition behind using p-normalization? Why is logit information helpful in distinguishing between correctly classified and incorrectly classified samples?\n2) For figure 10:  \u201cmodels that produce highly confident MSPs tend to have better confidence estimators (in terms of NAURC), while models whose MSP distribution is more balanced tend to be easily improvable by post-hoc optimization\u2014which, in turn, makes the resulting confidence estimator concentrated on highly confident values.\u201d In instances where logit normalization proves ineffective, could the issue stem from the original model being under-calibrated, blurring the distinction between correctly and incorrectly classified samples due to a minimal confidence gap? My guess of why the logit normalization works is that: it is actually making the correct sample have much higher confidence while incorrect samples have slightly lower confidence, and therefore the confidence can distinguish them well. If this is the case, would it be possible to consider the corresponding ECE (compared to the histogram) to see if under-confident models are more easily improved, while over-confident models are not?  Based on my observation, many models in timm are actually under-confident due to insufficient training.  \n3) Why is learnable p-norm better than L2-norm? Why is a different norm required for different datasets? How significant is the benefit of this learnability? I think an ablation study can be better to support the use of learnable p.\n4) What loss objective was used in the training of 'p' and 't'? Was it AURC or normalized AURC?\n5) How was MSP FALLBACK considered in the experiments? Was it only taken into account when calculating the evaluation metric \"average positive gain\"? For a dataset, what criteria should we use to decide whether to use MSP or logit normalization? Should we still rely on its performance on the validation set, or is there a separate held-out set for deciding whether to use MSP Fallback?\n6)  Is the third graph in Figure 3 also at 0.3491? It seems to have a high correlation.\n7) Can you provide a more detailed explanation of Figure 3? What kind of message can we read from different optimal values of 'p'? Are models with different 'p' but the same architecture shown in the same plot?\n8) In Sec 4.3, it states: \"This robustness can be explained by a strong correlation between the selective performance in the original test set and under distribution shift.\" Could you elaborate on what this sentence means?\n9) If time permits, it would be better to include a result for NAURC in Table 4 for consistent comparison."

If the proposed post-hoc fix works, would that not remove the the need for the NAURC score as accuracy now determines SC performance (i.e., accuracy and calibration are correlated)?\n- Section 4.3 which talks about performance under distribution shift. It appears like the finding that better in-distribution classification performance leads to out-of-distribution performance is also not new and discussed in [1]. Although the paper does provide the exact numbers of how strongly performance degrades, the take-away message beyond the effect already introduced in [1] appears limited.\n\n**References**:\n\n[1] Miller, John P., et al. \"Accuracy on the line: on the strong correlation between out-of-distribution and in-distribution generalization.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
