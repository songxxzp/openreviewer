It is nice to show some wins on more datasets, especially larger ones. I also suggest to remove the word \"very\" for \"very large citation networks\", on 2nd page 3rd paragraph.\n\nIn fact, the SIGN model (also designed to scale GNNs, by computing pretraining ($Z = AAX$) then training on rows $Z$ without ever looking at adjacency matrix $A$ ever again during training, i.e., the graph is only used for untrainable pre-processing then usual SGD training proceeds.\n\n# Comparison with earlier work\n\nThe work on GTTF (Marowitz et al, ICLR 2021) is very similar: it develops a general algorithm that can be specialized for training GNNs and skip-gram models (like deepwalk) by sampling, they also prove that the parameters learned with sampling are equivalent to ones learned on full graph, under some assumptions (the actual assumptions and proofs in GTTF differ). \n\nIt would be nice if this paper brings in something new: if it is the analysis, name the paper appropriately. Otherwise, it feels like just another paper that is doing sampling (like GraphSAGE, GTTF, etc)\n\n# Uninterpretable math\n\n* The notation is not standard. E.g., instead of $READOUT(h_v, v\\in V)$, it could be $READOUT([h_v]_{v \\in V})$ -- As-is, it looks like a function accepting 2 arguments: a feature vector and a boolean (is $v$ a member of $V$).\n\n* Further, the expression for $\\mathcal{P}_n$ at end of page 5 is hard to decipher\n\n* In section 3.2, there are 3 conflicting definition of $\\mathcal{v}_g$. It says $\\mathcal{v}_g : G \\rightarrow R^+$ but then invokes it on same line as $v_g(G, v)$\n\n* Having READOUT function (last line of Alg.1) is ambiguous: how are the sampled nodes any special to give a signal to the entire graph?\n\n* Is $\\mu$ a measure or an instance? In definition 4.1, it overloads it to be both\n\n* What is $B$ above Eq 6? Is it the same as defined later in Sec 4.2?\n\n# Minor Improvements\n* In Section 2: GNNAutoScale is **not** sampling-based GNN. On the other hand, it is based on historical embeddings.\n* Below Equation 2, you say \"simple aggregation\". Why not be explicit and define \"simple\" right here?"
