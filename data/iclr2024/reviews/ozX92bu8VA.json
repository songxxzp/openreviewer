The authors demonstrate that the performance in open-ended question answering is improved when rank-reduction is applied to the specific weight matrix. Moreover, they confirm consistent performance enhancements in tasks on non-text domains such as policy learning and image classification. Additionally, through analysis, it has been observed that high-order components contain factually incorrect knowledge which degrades question answering performance."

However, this work uses none of them. Therefore, I am not convinced that this robust performance can be achieved across all the above-mentioned aspects.\n-The authors do not provide the final search results of rank reduction, i.e. the layers selected for compressing and the reduced rank, in the final performance in Table1, 2 & 3. It is very important to provide these results to show that the selected model is indeed in a reduced rank."

(4096*0.0025=10.24, not an integer?)\n\nThe used CounterFact is very similar to the table-to-text generation task (but for a qa task), which is not a frequently used dataset to test even the QA and factual/world-knowledge reasoning performance of LLM. Any reason for choosing the dataset?"

This paper presents this rank reduction method, LASER, that removes the components in the {Q,K,V,O} matrices that have smaller singular values (i.e., those higher-order components).\n\nThis paper finds that the effects of reduction is not uniform across layers. The performance degradation can be found by reducing early layers, while significant performance benefits are available, often by pruning the later layers. This effect is the most obvious in the MLP output, and is also observable in the k, q, v matrices.\n\nThis paper further dives into studying what types of facts are recovered by rank reduction, and finds that the facts recovered on rank reduction are most likely those infrequently present in the data. \n\nWhy are the higher-ordered components noisy? And what are the higher-ordered components computing? This paper approximates the final weight matrix using its higher-ordered components, and analyze how the model\u2019s behavior changes on the datapoints that GPT-J\u2019s lower-order components lead to incorrect outputs. They find that the model predicts incorrect entities of the same semantic type as the correct answer. As more lower-ordered components are included, the output changes to predicting common word tokens.\n\nWith additional experiments (on text domains including QA and non-text-domains including learning policies, images), this paper studies the generalizability of the findings."
