It is not clear to me why off-policy corrections are not necessary given that the sequence of rewards was generated by a different policy; it feels like frequency at which the sequences appear must be corrected for.\n2. Related to above, it appears that the only \"off-policyness\" in Eqn 5 is the $\\pi$-centered constraint. Why is this sufficient for the off-policy correction?\n3. The decomposition seems related to exogenous and endogenous stochasticity. Is there a way to phrase the current work in that context? I'd also refer the authors to this paper that seems relevant: https://people.csail.mit.edu/hongzi/var-website/content/iclr-19.pdf\n4. I am curious if once the advantage function is decomposed into skill and luck, is there a benefit to weighing each component differently? I would suspect that this leads to some bias in the policy ordering, but I am wonder if say the skill related component is too small, it may get overshadowed by the luck component, and the agent may not learn efficiently.\n5. Related to above, I am curious how off-policy DAE performs as a function of environment stochasticity. \n6. In Figure 3 and 4, it is unclear to me why all methods are able to produce similar mean estimates? Of course each is different in terms of their variance, but all are centered around the same mean which is a bit surprising.\n7. What were the number of trials for the Figure 5 results? These should be mentioned."

By explicitly modeling the advantage attributed to this luck factor, the agent can more effectively discern the impact of its own actions, leading to quicker generalization through enhanced credit assignment.

Requiring a sum over all discrete latent states seems a bit restrictive in the choice of model and it seems to prevent easy scaling of the model size.\n\n- Could you clarify how equation (10) reduces to the policy improvement lemma? In particular, what happens to the $B^\\pi_t$ term? \n\n- Why was Tree Backup chosen as the baseline? It seems like a less popular or effective choice compared to, say, Retrace [1] or its successors. \n\n- It could be interesting to try to incorporate off-policy DAE with model-based RL methods since those algorithms would already have a learned model to use.
