                "value": "This paper explores in-context learning (ICL) for Large Language Models (LLMs) where the goal is to adapt the model to new tasks with minimal annotation. It introduces ADAICL, an active learning approach that efficiently selects examples for annotation within a limited budget. ADAICL identifies uncertain examples for the model and uses semantic diversity-based selection. This approach, treated as a maximum coverage problem, dynamically adapts based on the model's feedback. Experiments across datasets and LLMs demonstrate ADAICL's superiority, improving accuracy over state-of-the-art works and being up to 3 times more budget-efficient than random annotation. It also outperformed existing methods with half the number of annotated examples."

The method Vote-$k$ also uses the feedback of LLMs. Could the paper give more details about this?\n- Does the uncertain with respect to one example equal that the LLM can learn it accurately?\n- The paper argues that previous work assumes a high-resource setting, where a large set of ICL examples is already annotated. Could the paper provide some detailed examples for better understanding?\n- For Section 4.1, could the paper provide more details about how to obtain the probability with respect to the label or demonstrations?\n- Compared with previous work such as Vote-$k$, the method proposed by this work is more complex. It introduces a series of hyper-parameters. How to balance them in practice? Also, is there a time advantage of the proposed method over baselines?\n- What is the definition of \"egonet\" in this paper?\n- For Figure 5, could the paper supplement the comparison between all methods not just the best baseline?"

Although not for ICL, combining diversity and uncertainty for data selection have been studied in previous literature:\\\nEntropy-Based Active Learning for Object Detection With Progressive Diversity Constraint;\\\nCold-start data selection for few-shot language model fine-tuning: A prompt-based uncertainty propagation approach;\\\nACTUNE: Uncertainty-Based Active Self-Training for Active Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Language Models.\n\n3. The baseline methods are limited. Although the related work discusses a batch of work for active learning in ICL/NLP, only a few simple baselines are compared in experiments. How does ADAICL compare to other AL methods? Meanwhile, I am also wondering about the performance of zero-shot GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo.\n\n4.
