See below for one example.\n\nThe description of the method has problems, raising reproducibility issues:\n- It is unnecessarily complicated and could confuse the reader, For example, in eq (13) theta^T A_s_j theta is just the L2 norm of the theta on index set s_j.\n- It has undefined terms. For example SEF is referred in the introduction as the sparse envelope function, but its definition is never given, but is referred to as s_k^**  in Remark 1 and later, and s_k^** is never defined.\n\nThe paper is missing a Conclusion section and a discussion of the weaknesses of the proposed method.\n\nExperimental evaluation is lacking in many respects:\n- It is not clear what the AdaHSPG+ algorithm is because it is not defined.\n- Experiments with comparisons are done only on two easy datasets. More challenging datasets such as CIFAR-100 or Imagenet are not included.\n- The comparison is only with group Lasso based methods, relying on a statement from a Bui et al 2021 paper claiming that they work best. No works after 2021 that are not based on group Lasso are included in the evaluation. For example, Guo et al \"Network pruning via annealing and direct sparsity control\", IJCNN 2021 obtains better results on CIFAR-10 with VGG16."

However, these benchmarks might not fully reveal the practical efficiency and applicability of the proposed WGSEF regularization method in real-world, large-scale problems. For example, [Chen et al. 2021] tests its HSPG in structural prune ResNet on ImageNet, which could provide a stronger testament to the method's practicality.\n\n- The process for grouping parameters before regularization is not specified. An exploration of automated grouping algorithms, such as in\n\nChen, Tianyi, et al. \"OTOv2: Automatic, Generic, User-Friendly.\" The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations. 2022.\n\ncould be beneficial when applied with WGSEF."

                "value": "- This work extend the sparse envelope function (Back & Refael (2022)) into group sparsity. So, it appears as an extension which is applied to deep learning training. To evaluate their theoretical contribution could the authors comment on how their analysis differs from the SEF? Perhaps, comment on the challenges in the extension from SEF to the group case. For example, some corollary are direct extension of derivations already done by SEF paper.\n\n- What is the performance of WGSEF (algorithm 2) alone. This comparison is needed with WGSEF + HSPG to determine the advantages of proposed WGSEF.\n\n- To evaluate the results, experiment are needed on popular deep learning architectures (Unet, Transformers). Please include standard deviation over the reported numbers. LeNet is a very basic network. Please update results with a neural network commonly used in the literature. Moreover, characterization of the method is missing. A figure on how the performance varies as a function of the hyper-parameter on the sparsity. This would be helpful for sensitivity analysis of the method. \n\n- Almost all deep learning training are done with variants of Adam optimizer. I wonder if the authors could provide analysis on Adam as opposed to SGD.\n\n- Literature review is not comprehensive. For example, literature on l1 convex relaxation to l0 is missing (one example [1]). It is not clear how the contribution of this work differs from prior work on inducing group sparsity for efficient neural network architecture.\n\n- The organization of the paper needs improvement. Coherency can be improved. Here are some points. For example, in Section 5, the authors start talking about SGD which was not the main focus on the paper till this Section. Or again, the end of Section 5, the paper discusses some related works that are not relevant to the proposed method. I found many statements of the paper not related to the main theme of the paper, and also re-statement of results from prior works (e.g., Corollary 5.0.1). Moreover, I recommend to shorten the findings of Beck & Refael (2022) in the intro. Not clear why all those details are included in the intro before main contribution. Around (1) and (2), please mention that l0-norm is a pseudo norm. In find algorithm 1 redundant (Comparing to 2). Labels of figures are very small. Please increase the fontsize, and also use the table formatting suggested by the conference. I do find (1) and (2) unnecessary in the intro as the paper is based on SEF. Please justify why these equations must be there? I recommend to remove.\n\nOther comments.\n\n- Could the authors explain how the group SEF (their method) differs from group lasso? I find them related; however, the formulation no where refers to lasso or l1 type regularization.\n\n- I thank the authors for their thorough related works; however, this introduction is missing a statement on \"how their method differs from prior works\". Please comment.\n\n- Second paragraph of intro on generalization. Please also include advantages of over-parameterization. Otherwise, the sentence read a biased view. overparameterization does not result in an overfit (there is a double descent) if the amount of training data is very large. \n\n- Please elaborate what the  \"complete inverse problem\" is (in the intro).\n\n- Section 5 has related works on SGD which breaks down the flow of the paper. Could the authors explain why such related works on SGD is provided there? Recommend to move the paragraph after Algorithm 2 into appendix.\n\n- Which experiment (dataset) results of Table 1 refer to.\n\n\n[1] Donoho, D. L., & Elad, M. (2003).
