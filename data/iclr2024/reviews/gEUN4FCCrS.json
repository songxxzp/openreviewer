                "value": "This paper introduces an approach to improving the exploration capabilities of value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms by incorporating a value bonus. Unlike previous studies that define exploration bonuses as reward distributions, this method offers optimistic exploratory value even for unvisited state-action pairs. The technique involves maintaining an ensemble of random Q-functions and predictors that estimate the underlying reward. The behavior policy then selects greedy actions based on the augmented Q-function.\n\nThe experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this bonus when applied to the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm in both classical environments and some games in the Atari suite. The agent optimizes state coverage, leading to improved rewards. Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to enabling deep exploration in RL algorithms."

This method, which builds on prior research in uncertainty estimation and exploration strategies, offers a straightforward implementation of DQN variants and enhances exploration more effectively than traditional strategies like epsilon-greedy. The paper highlights a key strength: the ability to allocate optimistic value estimates to unvisited state-action pairs, a feature that methods that rely solely on reward bonuses do not offer.\n\nWhile the experiments are somewhat limited in terms of computational requirements, they are designed to support the paper's claims. VBE achieves promising results in some interesting classical experiments. These experiments show that VBE can potentially replace undirected exploration strategies in value-based RL algorithms. However, the overall narrative in the experiments section becomes unclear due to the non-standard experimental settings. The comparisons between VBE and the baselines are further complicated by the differences in RL algorithms (DDQN vs. PPO) and allowed environment steps, where DDQN's superior sample efficiency makes the comparisons unfair.\n\nIn summary, the paper presents a promising method for deep exploration in RL, although further clarification and additional experiments comparing different RL algorithms could strengthen the paper's overall argument."

However, a more comprehensive contextualization with existing prior work on deep exploration, specifically related to value bonuses, would enhance the paper's relevance. A thorough literature review would help readers understand the specific problem and knowledge gap this work addresses.\n\nThe experiments section, while exploring interesting environments, falls short of the standards expected for empirical studies in deep RL. While the selected environments are interesting for validating the proposed method, a more impactful study would involve challenging and widely recognized hard-exploration tasks. Additionally, the experimental settings do not align with the standard parameters for fair evaluation of deep RL algorithms, particularly in the context of hard-exploration tasks. The comparison between different RL algorithms (DDQN, PPO) under such limited environment interaction raises concerns about the fairness of the evaluation. It remains unclear whether the observed learning curve superiority of VBE after 50k steps is due to DDQN's known sample efficiency compared to PPO.\n\nIn summary, the paper introduces an interesting idea and presents it effectively. However, the current experiments, while promising, lack the necessary impact due to the limitations in experimental design and evaluation. Addressing these concerns and conducting experiments on more challenging and standard hard-exploration tasks would significantly enhance the paper's significance."

Instead, I would suggest using some of these resources for longer experiments, which might have offered a more fair analysis given the well-known sample inefficiency of deep RL algorithms.\n\nI appreciate the authors' effort in providing the reference codebase for implementing the RND and ACB baselines. However, I am not convinced about the effectiveness of this particular implementation, given the limited popularity of the codebase. I am concerned that this implementation might not be able to replicate the results of the proposed baselines, especially for RND. I would suggest using the official implementations or more widely validated ones.\n\nAdditionally, I wonder if the authors had considered exploring other environments that offer challenging exploration tasks. Environments involving 3D navigation or procedurally generated maps could potentially provide a more impactful evaluation of the proposed method. Including such environments in the experimental setup could strengthen the paper's contribution."

The ensemble is trained to approximate the next-state of a random target function, not the current state like RND, and during rollout, the behavior is taken as a max over actions for the current value for the problem reward and the bonus derived from the ensemble disagreement.

The idea of leveraging ensemble errors for deep exploration is a direction that might be worth further exploration in the future, even if this paper's execution might not fully capture the potential of the idea.\n\nIn sum, while the paper has its challenges, there is merit in the core idea it attempts to present and its potential implications for ensemble-based methods in reinforcement learning."

                "value": "This paper describes a simple idea in a somewhat convoluted manner. Here are specific areas of concern:\n\n- Clarity and Presentation: The paper tends to obfuscate what could be explained more simply. While there is value in rigorous mathematical explanations, these should be accompanied by intuitive explanations and clearer definitions for broader accessibility. For example, the distinction between equation 2 and the actual bonus used in algorithm 1 are not clearly demarcated, leading to potential confusion.\n\n- Novelty Concerns: Upon close examination, the proposed method seems to be essentially a variant of the classical UCB exploration strategy, replacing the count based bonus to ensemble error based bonus; as well as a variant to RND, with difference in ensembles. Moreover, there are clear parallels with the bootstrapped DQN approach, which already encourages first-visit optimism. While the paper does acknowledge the connection to bootstrapped DQN, the explanation is not well-presented, and readers may find it challenging to discern the true novelty of the proposed method.\n\n- Significance of Contribution: Given the above, one might argue that the paper's primary contribution is an amalgamation of previously explored ideas. The ensemble error as an exploration bonus, though interesting, might not be substantial enough to warrant a separate methodology, especially given the similarities to existing methods.\n\n- Experimental Validation: Although not explicitly discussed earlier, it would be essential for such a paper to provide comprehensive experimental results to validate its claims, especially when the theoretical distinction from existing methods is subtle. Without this, it's challenging to gauge the real-world efficacy of the proposed approach.\n\nFor the paper to better achieve its goals, it would benefit from a clearer exposition, more transparent delineation of its novelty compared to existing methods. I am willing to raise my score if the author may improve the writing/presentation for better clarity."
