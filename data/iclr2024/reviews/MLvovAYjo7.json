Specifically, the paper presents three distinctive temporal conditioning strategies, prospective, historical and immediate conditions, to guide the diffusion sampling process. Building upon the Decision Diffuser, the authors model the distribution of state trajectories with the diffusion probabilistic model. The policy inference is implemented with a separated dynamic inverse module. The results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrated improved performance compared to the baseline methods. Ablation studies verified the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

What is the prospective condition used here? Also, could the authors clarify why the BC results in Table 2 differ greatly from those reported in the D4RL benchmark?\n- To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, could the authors please run some experiments on the sparse reward, high-dimensional state space tasks? i.e. the FrankaKitchen?\n- Could the author also explain further the effects of historical sequence length L in Table 9, specifically what dose the noise refers to in the statement \"In most other scenarios, the longer historical sequence (L = 10) provides negative improvements because the historical sequence may introduce useful information and extra noise concurrently, where the useless noise makes it hard for learning control.\"? Or would the performance drop due to the out-of-distribution generalization during test time? Since the longer the historical sequence is, the more likely the model has yet to see it during training.\n- I think the immediate condition is not clear enough. What is the $\\tau$ representation here? As in the previous description, $\\tau$ is the state sequence. How is the reward $r_t$ modeled here?"

In Fig. 2, it seems that 2(b) and 2(c) are not well distinguished. Though there is explanation about immediat and prospective condtions in the main text, it is hard to read differences directly from these two subgraphs.\n1. I did not find setting about the inverse dynamics model. Is it a pre-trained neural networks or some control theory-based models? I think the details of it should be included in the paper.\n1. In Table 2, there is no standard deviation of DD or TCD, while all other tables report standard deviations. Moreover, I did not find your settings about how many independent runs are conducted to compute these means and standard deviations.\n1. In Table 3, considering the standard deviations of the results, it is hard to say TCD is better  than TCD w/o $C_{IC}$ or TCD w/o $C_{HC}$, as there scores are too closed."

It seems to me this is an important piece of information for understanding the method that isn't clearly laid out in section 5 where it should be. \n- I didn't fully understand the $\\mathcal{C}_{HC}$ presentation in section 5. Are we replacing the closed-loop prediction history by ground truth history? How far are we looking?\n- The presented method \"only\" significantly improves over DD on Walker2d-mr and Hopper-m tasks, while it is an interesting results, I worry that the presented method adds complexity to the diffuser conditioning for marginal improvements. Can you show that the method does not in fact add a lot of time and/or memory complexity over DD, which could highlight performance gains without much impact on training on inference times?\n\nOverall the work is interesting but I need answers to these questions to be able to raise the final rating"
