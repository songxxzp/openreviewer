The paper proposes a Class-wise Matching Margin (CMM) to measure the underperforming categories. CMM is calculated based on the similarities of images and textual prompts. It can identify the worst-performing categories and estimate the potential performance of the candidate prompts. Furthermore, large language models are requested to enrich descriptions of worst-performing categories and build a weighted ensemble of prompts. CMM boosts the accuracy on the worst-10 categories on ImageNet to 5.2%, without manual prompt engineering, laborious optimization, or access to labeled validation data."

Leveraging LLMs, the paper enriches the textual prompts for these categories, leading to improved performance according to the conducted experiments."

Specific information regarding the worst-performing classes in ImageNet is missing, hindering readers from determining whether the poor performance stems from inherent ambiguities within these classes or issues with the model itself. Additionally, the paper neglects to compare CLIP models with models learned using other methods, such as supervised learning or visual contrastive learning. This omission makes it challenging to discern whether the identified problem is exclusive to CLIP models or prevalent across all models, significantly impacting the paper's contribution.\n\nThe proposed method is relatively straightforward and does not exhibit notable performance improvements. The idea of enhancing performance through enriched textual prompts is intuitive, resulting in limited novel insights provided by this paper. Furthermore, the analysis of the specific effects of richer textual prompts on the model remains superficial.\n\nIn conclusion, this article lacks a clear and concise problem definition, and the underlying causes of the identified problem are unclear. Moreover, the proposed method is relatively trivial, yielding only modest performance improvements. Consequently, the contribution of this article falls short of justifying its publication at ICLR."
