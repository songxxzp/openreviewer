It proposes a novel method RODEO to improve the quality of outlier exposures by generating diverse and near-distribution OOD synthetic samples through leveraging text descriptions of the potential OOD concepts and guiding diffusion model using these texts. The synthetic samples are utilized as OE during the adversarial training of a discriminator. It performs extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in the highly challenging task of Robust Novelty Detection. The proposed method maintains high OOD detection performance in both standard and adversarial settings across various detection scenarios, including medical and industrial datasets, demonstrating its high applicability in real-world contexts."

                "value": "I think this paper has the following weaknesses: \n\n1. The setup for theoretical analysis is too simple. It assumes the normal class follows $U(0, a-\\epsilon)$ and the anomaly class adheres to $U(a+\\epsilon, b)$. However, in practical datasets, the normal class distribution and the anomaly class distribution are much more complicated. It is unclear whether the conclusions drawn from the simple setup still hold for other distributions (or practical datasets). I think the authors can first consider Gaussian distributions to see if the analysis and conclusions still hold. \n\n2. The comparisons with the baselines may not be fair. The proposed method uses a generative diffusion model and a CLIP model, which are pre-trained on millions of data. However, some of the baselines (e.g., ATOM and ALOE) considered in the experiments don't use such extra data for training. Thus, the comparisons may not be fair. It is known that using extra data can significantly improve the model's performance. \n\n3. The PGD attack used is weak. The authors should use a PGD attack with multiple random restarts (e.g., 10 restarts) and more attack iterations (e.g., 1000 steps). Although it uses the strong attack AutoAttack, it doesn't explain how it adapts the AutoAttack to its settings. Since AutoAttack is not designed to attack OOD detectors, it cannot be directly used to attack OOD detectors. Besides, in Tables 2 and 3, the results for AutoAttack are missing."
