Estimation of the variance term posts additional difficulty since training may fall into two undesirable scenarios: (1) the inverse variance goes to zero, which means the heteroscedasticity is not learned, or (2) the inverse variance goes to infinity, which means the training data are overfitted.\n\nThis paper presents a categorization of the possible scenarios depending on how much regularization is applied to the mean function and variance function. For both mean and variance, there is a potential memorization vs. generalization distinction. In the 2D phase diagram, the interaction of the mean and variance functions results in 5 categories. \n\nThen the authors use heuristic arguments and propose numerical approximation to nonparametric\nfree energy, which aligns with experiments in relatively simple settings."

(main) Technically speaking, not sure which part of the paper is innovative---for example, Eqns 7--10, are they new or semi-new (i.e., similar derivations are obtained in a different context)?  I would be skeptical that Eqns 7--10 are entirely new. Also, the proposed regularization is well-studied in the literature.\n3. Data experiments are simple, but I am mostly fine with that, since this paper is mainly proof-of-concept.\n4.

By modeling parametrized neural network using continuous functions, reparametrizing regularization strength, proposing continuous regularization terms, and approximating the integral over $y$ by a single point, a computationally feasible nonparametric free energy approximating the log likelihood of deep heteroskedastic regression is derived. The reparametrized regularization strength is perceived as order parameters. The field model is solved numerically on a lattice. Abrupt change in the expressiveness of the model and the loss is observed and is interpreted as phase transition. Similar patterns also emerge when using real data and neural networks. The field-theory model implies that one-dimensional hyperparameter searching suffices."

By regularizing the model, first with differing levels of weight decay on the mean and covariance functions, and then extending this to the corresponding Dirichlet energies, the authors appeal to tools from statistical mechanics and the calculus of variations in order to derive a system of elliptic partial differential equations that give necessary conditions for energy minimization. This admits a phase diagram in terms of the regularization parameters, describing a two-parameter family of solutions that exhibit phase transitions between different regions of qualitative behaviour. Experimental validation of this behaviour is verified, and the two-dimensional family is reduced to a single dimension for the purposes of hyperparameter optimization."
