                "value": "In this paper, the authors propose a variational encoder-decoder model to predict the dynamics of a system of interacting objects given a sequence of historical observations. The system is expressed as a graph, where each node represents an object and the edges represent the interactions between the objects.\n\nThe historical trajectories are processed by an attentional GNN encoder to produce the node representations, which are then aggregated to produce a global representation of the system.\n\nA neural ODE decoder is designed to address the problem of modeling the continuous dynamics of interacting systems. The core of the architecture is a graph neural network, in which each node employs a mixture of several globally shared message-passing functions to aggregate information from its neighbors and model the velocity of its latent state. These message-passing functions are called prototypes and are learned from the data. The mixture weights for each node are determined by a function of the node representation and the global representation, which means that the mixture may vary across nodes.\n\nThe model is trained using the usual VAE objective. To facilitate the representation learning on the encoder side, the authors propose two auxiliary contrastive losses to encourage the encoder to learn 1) disentangled representations of the objects and the system; and 2) informative system representations. A set of known system parameters is used as a supervisory signal for the second loss."

Lemma 3.1. guarantees only that the ODE has a unique solution, which covers only the computational aspect. This is not a surprising, nor a crucial result. In machine learning approaches to time series modeling, the main challenge usually is not to design ODEs with well-defined solutions. It comes straightforwardly after the Lipschitz continuity assumption that is easy to satisfy when the function approximators are neural nets. The main challenge is rather the predictive power and generalization capacity of the developed models.\n\n * It is very surprising that despite the extreme similarity of the paper structure, even Figure 1 and Lemma 3.1, to the material reported in (Luo et al., 2023), the paper does not clarify the difference of the proposed method to this recent work. Likewise, the paper aims to solve the exact same problem as Yildiz et al., 2022\u2019s I-GPODE, which even has a subsection about the disentanglement properties of their Graph ODE based interaction model. Yet the proposed method is not differentiated from it. To me even a numerical comparison to such recent work developed for the same exact purpose (interaction modeling) based on the same conjecture (disentanglement) is essential. Overall, I think the literature positioning aspect of the paper is extremely premature.\n\n--- POST REBUTTAL ---\n\nThe rebuttal response did not address my concerns. We appear to agree with the authors about the scope of the theoretical contribution of the work but we will remain in disagreement about its significance.\n\nI also do not think my concern about the HONE paper is properly addressed. I still wonder what big weakness of HONE the current approach addresses, where the extreme similarity of the proposed material to this prior work comes, and why it is not addressed properly in the paper. I do not consider the difference in the empirical results as a justification for novelty. I was wondering about the cause, not the effect. I keep my score unchanged."

The way the other two terms are used in Equation 18 are also derived following well-justified desiderata.

I believe this paper is trying to do not just interacting dynamics but actually agent-based modeling. Given this context, I am completely unclear as to what a \"factorized prototype\" is, the authors just use this term without definition and repeatedly explain the method this way. The other key feature of an agent based system thats not just in an interactive dynamic system (like a gene regulatory network) is that the graph consisting of agents changes with time based on the movements of the agents. This would be the key challenge to using a GNN/Graph ODE to model agent dynamics and this is not  addressed here clearly despite defining the data as consisting of different graphs at different timepoints. \n\nAdditionally the authors refer to some type of hierarchical representation which is again completely unclear. My best guess is that each object somehow evolves based on a combination of those GNN \"factored prototypes\" but that seems somewhat strange. Couldn't we just learn an individualized evolution based on a GNN with an MLP aggregation layer? What is the need for \"factored\" prototypes, I can at least see an argument for selecting a prototype (using a softmax or something of this sort).\n\nThe problem setup seems to sweep the most important thing under the rug. They talk about the problem of forecasting the dynamics of predicting the features, but what about continuously predicting the changes in the graph? Or are these all given? Aren't their observations discrete? Don't the graphs have to be updated continuously also, and how exactly is the graph changed at each iteration of the graph ODE? These and many question are unanswered. \n\nI would recommend for the authors to rewrite the paper from scratch, not assuming anyone knows anything about agent dynamics or object contexts. Define every technical term, and fully specify the problem. Without a thorough rewrite it is very unclear what is going on.  \n\nMoreoever there are other agent based models like the agent former that the authors have not compared their method with."
