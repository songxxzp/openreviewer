To leverage the motifs information, this paper proposes to construct drug motif trees and applies graph transformer to learn drug representation. The drug representations are then used to identify the relevancy to patient's current condition as well as to predict the new possible drugs. Finally, drug-drug interaction information is used to reduce the risk that could potentially caused by harmful drug-drug interactions. This paper reports that it out performs several non-trivial baselines on two datasets on drug recommendation task.

DEPOT is a drug recommendation framework that utilizes drug motifs to deliver accurate and safe prescription recommendations. This work includes a structural information-aware module that enhances the representation of molecular graphs. Additionally, the authors have incorporated two modules, known as the repeat and explore encoders, in an attempt to capture the dynamic relationship between drug motifs and disease progression. These three modules are designed to integrate long-term patient representations, offering recommendation results from three distinct perspectives: functionality, reusability, and exploratory. Moreover, historical Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) information is integrated in a non-linear way to ensure recommendation stability and minimize DDI rates. The authors conducted experiments on two datasets, and the results demonstrate that DEPOT exhibits a modest performance improvement over the baseline methods."

                "value": "The paper needs to be proofread for English language and checked for typos. Although the paper overall is well written, I struggled following the proposed method section. This section requires significant improvement for clarity.  Specifically, I felt that sometimes there was an unnecessary addition of technical detail and an overall lack of intuition provided. The notation also needs refinement; there are instances of variable reuse and repurposing for different meanings, along with some undefined variables. Specific examples illustrating these concerns are provided in the Questions section of this review. \n\nMy biggest concern is that I believe that the experimental results are not strong enough to substantiate the claims made throughout the paper. DEPOT showcases only marginal improvements over the state-of-the-art (SOTA), with gains of no more than 0.01 across all metrics, and often even less. A similar trend is observed in the ablation studies, where the incremental improvements do not seem commensurate with the inclusion of each component. Notably, in the ablated models, the performance remains comparable to, or in some cases even better than, the SOTA. \n\nThere are claims like this: \u201cDEPOT-NS performs graph aggregation at the atomic level, limiting its ability to perceive the semantics and synergistic interactions of high-order motifs, thereby resulting in weak performance.\u201d However, the performance of DEPOT-NS was, at its worst in one of the metrics, 0.003 lower than DEPOT. This marginal difference in performance raises questions about whether it is appropriate to label a model without motif collaboration as having 'weak performance' based on such a small variation.\n\nGiven that the venue is intended for a broader audience, which may include readers unfamiliar with the specific subfield presented in this paper, it is crucial to provide a more comprehensive context. A prime example of this issue can be found in the 'Diverse motif tree construction' section, where the authors introduce the 'RECAP decomposition' method. While the paper includes relevant citations, it is essential to supplement this with explanations or intuitive descriptions of the RECAP decomposition method for the benefit of readers unfamiliar with it. Additionally, there is a lack of clarity regarding the significance of the results presented in Figure 3 supporting the claims made in the respective section. Figure 3 lacks a proper caption and is not explained in the text at all, making it challenging for readers to discern its relevance and implications.\n\nMinor comments:\n- A refinement of the captions would benefit the clarity of the paper.\n- For Figure 2, $m_{re}^{N_k}$ and $m_{d}^{N_k}$ have different lengths but should be the same considering the Hadamard product. Also, the font style should follow the math style. \n- In Section 3.2.1., the acronym MGSSL needs to be defined.\n- In Figure 7(a), the label varing needs to be changed to varying. \n- On page 5, normilization to normalization.  \n- There are some references that point to pre-prints instead of the venues where they were published:\n    - Diederik P Kingma and Max Welling.

                "value": "Regarding notation:\n- In Equation 3, $g( \\cdot )$ is used to denote a transformation matrix, however, in Equation 4, $W$ is used to denote a different transformation matrix. It is unclear to me why the different conventions to denote this. Perhaps it would be better to maintain one convention of notation throughout the paper.\n- Right above Equation 6, $h^i$ is defined, but the $i$ for drugs was used as a subscript before. Is this correct?\n- In Equations 7 and 8, $q^u$ is reused. This part is not entirely clear to me. It is being used in its own definition, which makes me think there\u2019s a sequential order to these equations. Can the authors provide some more details about this?\n- In Equation 19, what is $\\eta$? I don\u2019t see it defined.\n\nIn Figure 2, what is Func Cross? I don\u2019t see it in the caption or referenced in the text. Can the authors elaborate on this?\n\nI have a question regarding Equation 15 in the paper, where the authors employ the Hadamard product to combine the patient-centric and drug-centric retrieval probabilities and subsequently apply the sigmoid function. Given that the product of two probabilities always yields a value between 0 and 1, it appears that the lowest possible input to the sigmoid function can be 0. This implies that the range of Equation 15 and the output $\\hat{o}_{N_k}$ will be $[0.5, 1)$, rather than the desired $(0, 1)$. Could you please clarify if you have taken this into consideration? If not, it's important to note that having the lowest probability set to 0.5 could potentially have a significant impact on the model's training process.\n\nFor the DDI loss section, what is WA in Figure 4? I don\u2019t believe this is mentioned and it should be clarified. \n\nI have some reservations about the Case Study presented in the paper, particularly regarding the potential for 'cherry-picking' this specific example. It seems that the intended purpose of this section is to demonstrate DEPOT's superiority in terms of Recall and Precision (however, the assertion about Recall is not entirely accurate since DEPOT has the same Recall as MoleRec). To provide more robust evidence in this regard, would it be beneficial to consider a more general approach? For instance, calculating the average recall and precision across all patients in the test set might offer a more comprehensive and representative assessment of DEPOT's recommendation performance relative to other methods."

                "value": "W1: The presentation of the paper is poor and the notation is confusing. For example, since the paper contains a large number of notations , the authors could consider providing some information about the dimensionality of the vectors. In addition, in the experiment, the expression and font size in Figure 3 make it difficult to read, and the title of vertical axis in Figure 4 is missing.\n\nW2: This paper contains many steps, the plausibility of which should be verified with much more experiments. For example, the authors claim that they have innovatively incorporated rich structural embeddings, including degree $E_{deg}$ and recency $E_{rec}$. The validity of this step needs to be verified by ablation studies. In addition, it is possible to add another layer of feed-forward neural network instead of directly performing the multiplication in Eq. (6) and Eq. (15).\n\nW3: Why is only consider the last state $N_{k}$ in stead of all the states in some equations like Eq. (7) and Eq. (15)? Is it possible to combine attention or weight decay technic to weight all states to obtain more information?\n\nW4: In explore encoder part, why are the numerator and denominator of Eq 10 is exp($e_{e}$) instead of exp($e_{r}$)? A representation learned using the observed motif should be more helpful.\n\nW5: what is the usage of the discriminate encoder? In addition, what is the meaning of P(r | u, $I_{S}$), P(e | u, $I_{S}$) and Eq. (13)?"
