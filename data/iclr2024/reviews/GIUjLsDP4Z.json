Currently, there are many variables in the article that are not explained, which can be challenging for newcomers to understand\n3. In spite of keeping settings and optimization hyperparameters consistent among different settings, the authors should still provide the corresponding parameter configurations. This would aid in experiment reproducibility and, as a result, make the results more robust.\n4. In Section 3.1, the authors mention, 'We believe that the curvature information of edges away from the extremes of the curvature distribution, which is not being used by curvature-based rewiring methods, can be beneficial to GNN performance.' I consider this assertion somewhat speculative, and I did not find any subsequent experiments that substantiate this claim. Would it be possible to include relevant ablation experiments to support this hypothesis?\n5. In Section 3.1, the authors define LCP as 'five summary statistics of the CMS.' I would appreciate a more detailed motivation for this particular definition. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include relevant ablation experiments that showcase the impact of removing specific summary statistics to demonstrate their significance in influencing the final results."
