However, some conditions are irrelevant to solving the question, and, inspired by this, the authors propose to identify and ignore irrelevant conditions, by 1) firstly calculating similarities across conditions and between conditions and the question, and then 2) further prompting the LLM to determine whether conditions with low similarities are indeed irrelevant to solving the question. After that, the authors prompt the LLMs to ignore the identified irrelevant conditions. The authors validate their proposed method, namely I$^3$C, which is coupled with other prompting methods, and show that the proposed I$^3$C significantly increases their performance on multiple math word problem datasets."

The authors may conduct an ablation study on it (using either of them, for analyzing each module's contribution to filtering).\n* The computational costs in using the proposed I$^3$C with existing prompting methods may be significantly increased, compared to using prompting methods only, since it further verifies the relevance of each candidate condition with LLMs, especially when the number of candidate conditions is large. Further, in Figure 2 which shows the efficiency of the proposed model against the self-consistency model, it may be more reasonable to include the efficiency of the prompting methods without the proposed I$^3$C and then compare them. \n* It is a bit unclear why including the examples, whose conditions are semantically very different from the question and other conditions, as the demonstrations of the prompt can improve the performance substantially.

Finally, the approach incorporates the feedback from LLMs to build an instruction and augments CoT prompting so as to better ignore irrelevant conditions. In addition to the I3C approach, authors also consider selecting confusing examples to construct prompts. The authors perform experiments on several math-word-problem datasets.

I believe it would be useful to discuss this overhead, at least token overhead in more detail in the main experiments.\n\nCurrently, the paper provides a very brief analysis in Figure 2, comparing zeroCoT+I3c against ZeroCoT+Consistency. I believe more detailed analysis should be provided covering more datasets (especially, on GSM, see point 2) and more approaches (especially on Instruct-CoT, see point 3). In particular, based on Figure 2, it seems like the cost Zero-COT + I3C roughly equals to 5 self-consistent sampling. I think at least the comparison should be made between Instruct-COT + 5 sample SC and Instruct-CoT + I3C on GSM.\n\nIn a more principled way, it is good if all the comparisons can be provided on an equal-computation-basis, (e.g., providing the comparison between Instruct-CoT + consistency with Instruct-CoT+I3C in the main table)\n\n---\n\n2.The paper does not thoroughly discuss the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a setting where there aren\u2019t many distractors. The chosen datasets are limited in complexity and may favor the proposed approach.\n\nIn particular, most of the datasets contain synthetically injected irrelevant conditions (these are somewhat an adversarial setting). The only more natural dataset is GSM, which is also limited in complexity. I believe it would be useful to include experiments on more complex and more natural datasets like AQUA and MATH to investigate how the approach generalizes to more common settings.\n\n---\n\n3.The choice of baselines may inflate the gain. IIUC, many of the baselines can be upgraded to include the instructions from Shi et al., 2023.\n\n---\n\n4.The paper only considers CoT prompting and does not test on a wide range of executor-augmented prompting techniques like PAL (Gao et al., 2023). SatLM (Ye et al., 2023). These approaches show significant improvements over base CoT prompting techniques on math-world problems.\n\n---\n\n5.The paper mainly tests on text-davinci-003, it is unsure how it will generalize to more advanced models like gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4, which could possibly be better at ignoring irrelevant conditions.\n\n---\n\n6.While the paper proposes I3C-select, it provides little comparison to other example-selection approaches like Complexity-CoT (Fu et al., 2022) and compositional examples (Ye et al., 2023).\n\n---\n\n[1] PAL: Program-aided language models, Luyu Gao et al., 2023\n\n[2] SatLM: Satisfiability-aided language models with declarative prompting, Xi Ye et al., 2023\n\n[3] Complexity-Based Prompting for Multi-Step Reasoning.
