The main motivation of the work is centered around the fact that the current datasets are either not suitable for open-ended evaluation or rely on expensive and limited human evaluation. The approach involves using LLM as data creators + LLM as evaluators. I like the motivation of the work, however, the paper majorly lacks in the quality of the experiments and its setup.\n\nComments:\n\n- My major issue with the setup is using LLMs as data curators! Many existing LMMs are trained on GPT-4 generated data such as LLaVA, mPLUG-Owl etc. To what extent is the evaluation fair across all the models which are not specifically not trained on the GPT-4 generated data?\n- The experiments are performed by generating instructions and responses for the COCO images and their corresponding COCO captions. I find this setup highly concerning since InstructBLIP (best model in their eval) is trained with COCO captions. Similarly, other models like LLaVA are also trained with the COCO captions. Again, this makes the evaluation unfair to all the models. \n- Quoting from the paper: \u201c Besides, we carefully curated approximately 28.5K high-quality samples to comprise the validation dataset, which was subsequently utilized for performance evaluation.\u201d There is no information on how this curation was performed? \n- Benchmark scope: It remains unclear to me how an image in the dataset is assigned a particular subskill? When do you know that a particular image has physics related possible questions?\n- Quoting from the paper: \u201cDue to the nature of reasoning-based questions often lacking a unique answer, we format them as multiple-choice questions, thus reducing the difficulty of evaluation and ensuring its accuracy.\u201d It would be better to provide some examples to understand why reasoning-based questions need multiple choice questions. Why can\u2019t they be just open-ended even if they lack a unique answer.\n- Thanks for showing distributions of the question length and cosine similarity. Figure 3b looks more or less overlapping and hence does not shout semantic richness in comparison to other dataset. \n- Figure 3 should also have datasets like Visit-Bench or Touchstone where the questions are collected from humans. I feel that the human questions will be the most diverse.\n- How much does it cost to add a new model to your benchmark involving 28.5K instances?\n- To establish LLM as a valid judge, the paper does not have any correlations with human numbers. In addition, it would be important to show that simpler metrics that are based on lexical similarity are not good judges for this dataset, which it currently does not do.\n- I like the paper\u2019s diversification into understanding the usefulness of the models along different skills and sub-skills."
