This current presentation is kind of poor that I struggle to read all the derivation in the main paper and the appendix. I suggest to **bold** all vectors and matrices, following the usual practice of ICLR papers, to differentiate them from scalars. For example, in Eq. (9), it is very hard tell how $O_t$ could possibly subtract $\\bar{o}_t$, when the former is a matrix and the latter is a vector. \n\n- The organization of section 3.1 is also confusing. I suppose the authors try to provide three choices of method for selecting the GMM parameters. However, three methods just appear without much explanation and any reference to the previous works on GMM. From the experiment results, I prefer to a more condense presentation on the DDIM-GMM-ORTHO-VUB solution, while the discussion on DDIM-GMM-RAND and DDIM-GMM-ORTHO can be moved to the Appendix for ablation studies.\n\n- The experimental results in section 4 are very unclear. The performance differences in Figure 1-7 are basically not noticeable. While these figures occupy about 1.5 pages of the main paper, their provided information might be less than two table (one for CelebAHQ and FFHQ; one for ImageNet). The current presentation of results is so ineffective that I cannot find any significant improvement against the original DDIM sampling approach."

Furthermore, as the number of steps increases beyond 10, the performance difference between DDIM ($\\eta=0$) and DDIM-GMM becomes almost negligible.\n- What are the values of $\\eta$ used in the figures where the generated samples are displayed? The visual assessment of the sampling results makes it difficult to qualitatively determine which method produces better quality. In scenarios with 10 steps, both methods frequently result in deformed structures, and at 100 steps, it becomes challenging to definitively decide which method delivers superior quality.
