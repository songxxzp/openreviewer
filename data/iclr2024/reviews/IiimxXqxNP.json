            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Unfortunately, the work ignores many of the relevant prior works and failed to cite them/compare HyperFQI against them. In the abstract, the paper says that \u201cthis is the first principled RL algorithm that is provably efficient and also practically scalable to complex environments such as Arcade learning environment.\u201d But this is not true.  LSVI-PHE (Ishfaq et al. 2021), LMC-LSVI (Ishfaq et al 2023), \u00a0BayesUCBVI algorithm from Tiapkin et. al, ICML 2022 are examples of TS based methods that are both provably efficient and practically scalable. The work also doesn\u2019t compare HyperFQI against these algorithms in the experiment section. Consequently, many of the \u201cnovelty\u201d and \u201cfirst one achieving\u201d type of claims seem to be over-claim. \n\nThe Atari experiment uses only 26 games and uses 2M training data (i.e. 10M frames) whereas the standard is to use 200M frames. At the very least, I would expect the authors to include results of 50M frames. The results provided in Table 4 is very skewed and unfair representation of performance for the baselines. Also it\u2019s not clear how the authors found numbers for DDQN and Rainbow from Hessel et al. (2018) for 2M training data given the tables in that paper represent results for 200M training frames (Please see Question 14). Given 200M training frames, most of the baselines seem to perform SIGNIFICANTLY better than reported result based on Hessel et al. (2018). So, I think it is imperative that HyperFQI be trained for larger number of training frames for better and fair comparison. \n\nIt is also not clear what was the basis of picking these particular 26 games from Atari 57 suite. Even though the paper mentions Bellemare et al. (2016) as a basis for picking easy exploration, hard exploration (dense reward) and hard exploration (sparse reward), the paper uses only a single hard exploration (sparse reward) task namely Freeway in the experiment whereas Bellemare et al. (2016) classified 7 games as sparse reward hard exploration task. Could you provide results for those games for better and fair comparison? In particular, could you provide result for Pitfall, Gravitar, Solaris and Venture as some of the baselines have been shown to work well for these games? \n\nRegarding the regret bound result, first and foremost a detailed proof is missing and the paper only mentions some lemmas and the final theorem without any proof (both in the main paper and the appendix). \n\nTypos:\nIn section 2.1, \u201cterminal $\\in \\mathcal{S}$\u201d\nIn Section 2.2, the definition of $f_\\theta$ for ensemble model seems to have typo as well.\nThe last line of Section 2.2 \u201cimportance of difference\u201d \u2014> \u201cimportant differences\u201d"

In the introduction, what did you mean by \u201crandomly perturbing  a prior\u201d?\n\n3. In equation 2, what is the difference between the fixed prior model and randomized prior function proposed in Osband et al 2018?\n\n4. > HyperFQI selects the action based on sampling single or multiple indices and then taking the action with the highest value from hypermodels applying these indices.

How do you define solving the DeepSea environment in the presented experiments?\n\n11. Did you try BootDQN with randomized prior function (Osband et al 2018) as a baseline in Fig 2?\u2028\n12. Given the optimistic sampling strategy of HyperFQI-OIS is very similar to LSVI-PHE proposed in Ishfaq et al 2021, it is important to include it as a baseline for the DeepSea experiment. Can you compare your algorithm against it?\n\n13. What is NpS mentioned under \u201cablation study\u201d of Section 4.1?\n\n14. > In Table 4, we present the best score achieved in each environment with 2M steps. The scores for Rainbow and DDQN are obtained from Hessel et al. (2018) \n \nI checked Hessel et al. (2018) and couldn\u2019t find a table that has result for 2M steps. The tables are for 200M frames results. How did you find the 2M step results for Rainbow and DDQN from Hessel et al. (2018)? \n\n15. Is it possible to have an implementation of the algorithms in supplemental material?

While parameter count is an interesting metric to study, it is not convincing to me that the method would be able to scale up.\n- Are there experiments that show that having large index dim helps on Atari (e.g.., similar to the ablation study shown in Figure 5)? Without that it is unclear to me whether the results on Atari is due to better parameter tuning or due to the proposed method.\n\nThe second weakness is the theory section (Section 5). The authors list a bunch of results in the main body, but I could not find proofs to any of them anywhere in the paper. Also, there are lot of missing pieces that could have made the theoretical results much better positioned in the literature.

                "value": "This paper introduces HyperFQI, a framework for inducing enhanced exploration using Thompson sampling in reinforcement learning. The paper approximates the posterior distribution of action-values with a hypermodel formulation and selects an action by sampling a noisy index from a fixed distribution, then combines it with the learned value function. These perturbations, caused by the noisy sample, motivate the agent to explore more and identify interesting states. When tested on the DeepSea benchmark and 26 Atari games (2M interactions), results indicate HyperFQI surpasses baselines like Rainbow and HyperDQN."

                "value": "W1: Although the paper is well-constructed, its primary motivation \u2014 efficiently approximating the posterior distribution for Thompson sampling\u2014is not novel. Specifically, [1] presents a similar idea, opting for a variational distribution to approximate the posterior in complex observation environments. The primary distinction seems to be the choice between hypermodel and variational distribution.\n\nW2: The mentioned best scores for the Atari games appear to represent best scores from the 20 seeds. I believe that standard reporting typically involves the average score across these seeds rather than cherrypicking only the top scores.\n\nW3: The experimental methodology, aiming to demonstrate advantages, is not entirely balanced. The paper employs different architectures (DQN nature vs Rainbow vs HyperFQI) and learning algorithms (Fitted Q-iteration vs Q-learning) when compared with the baselines. Additionally, training the model on 2M interactions doesn't exactly highlight data efficiency. A 100K interaction scenario might have been more appropriate.\n\n[1]  Aravindan, Siddharth, and Wee Sun Lee. 2021. \u201cState-Aware Variational Thompson Sampling for Deep Q-Networks.\u201d arXiv [Cs.LG]. arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03719."
