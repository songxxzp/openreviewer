Please confirm if this understanding is accurate.\n\n2. Figure 2 is the sole explanation of the whole architecture, but lacks legends to clarify components like \u201cCTRL\u201d. More descriptive captions could improve the clarity.\n\n3. The formulations in Eq. 4-12 introduce many new concepts without definitions in the preceding sections. For example, the definitions of SpatialCore and TemporalCore are unclear; it is unknown whether SpikeNeuron refers to LIF; it is still unclear what RPE refers to after reading the full paper, etc.\n\n4. The definition of the Spatial-Temporal Core in Section 3.3 is slightly vague. My interpretation is that the Spatial Core refers to the 3-layer spatial convolution with a residual connection, while the Temporal Core performs temporal convolution after collecting all output spikes in the simulation. Please confirm if this understanding is correct. Besides, the mechanism of the Temporal Core seems to introduce serious waiting latency in actual SNN deployment.\n\n5. It seems SGA alters self-attention to cross-attention for fusing temporal representations?\n\n6. Section 3.5 provides the energy calculation methods, but does not give estimates of the energy consumption on specific tasks. Also, AC operations are closely related to network sparsity during runtime, which is not even mentioned. More details are needed.\n\n7. Testing on larger datasets beyond CIFAR could better demonstrate scalability and applicability to more complex tasks.\n\nMinor\n1. Last sentence of Section 2.2 Related Work: \"they rarely consider the spike data\", the meaning of spike data is unclear.\n\n2. Eq. in the last part of Section 3.1 does not have a correct reference.\n\n3. References 2 and 3 are duplicated."

Additionally, there doesn\u2019t actually appear to be any temporal dynamics eg: U_t^L depends on the previous layer (U_t^{L-1}) rather than the previous time (U_{t-1}^(L)).\n2.\tThe flow in figure 1 is difficult to follow. Many abbreviations are missing (Eg: SB, TB, SGA) some of these are defined later, but should be added to the legend here. Finally the LIF of the spatial block appears to terminate, while only the MP (MLP?) activity progresses to the rest of the network. Labeling the temporal block (green) within this figure would also be beneficial.\n3.\tAs the SGA is performing spatiotemporal convolution, this implies that spikes are accumulated over time from the output of the temporal block. It\u2019s unclear from the current write up how the concatenation over time interacts with the fact that the SGA itself should be spiking and evolving through time. \n4.\tThere are several additional hyperparameters other than those in the appendix (eg: number of units in the several linear layers, time constant of the LIF units, parameter initializations). Additionally, the \u201ccareful hyperparameter tuning\u201d mentioned in the appendix and \u201cmeticulously engineered\u201d kernels (S 3.3) are not sufficiently descriptive to enable replication studies.\n5.\tTraining (4.1 and 4.2) is not sufficiently described. Presumably some surrogate gradient and BPTT are being used on an appropriately chosen loss metric, but this is not described at all.\n6.\tI am particularly interested in the time constant of the leaky units, given the extremely small number of time steps. While other papers (eg: those presented in table 2) have used similarly small timesteps they typically involve additional tricks, such as sub-timestep spiking. Without additional transformations it is surprising that sufficient spikes would travel through the network in only 4 timesteps, especially with any appreciable leak term."
