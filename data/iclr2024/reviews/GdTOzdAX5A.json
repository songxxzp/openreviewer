You say: \"In causal inference (Peters et al., 2017), identifiability refers to whether the underlying causal structure can be correctly pinpointed from infinite observational data.\" - that is not at all what identifiability means in causal inference. It means whether or not an intervention e.g. $P(Y \\mid do(X=x))$ can be computed only from knowledge of the observational distribution $P(V)$ where $V$ is the set of all variables in the causal model, and the causal diagram $\\mathcal{G}$. What you are referring to has more to do with _causal discovery_ which is the process of learning the true DAG from the observational data.\n\n### Background\n\n- Is it important that $K < +\\infty$?\n- It may help readability if you use different symbols, rather than $\\theta$ for everything, for the different densities.\n\n### Theoretical considerations\n\n- This section may be better called 'Methods'. The current heading is a bit ambiguous - theoretical considerations of what?\n- I do not understand, what does $\\{1,\\ldots, K^T\\} \\rightarrow \\{1,\\ldots,K\\}^T$ mean?\n- What are these mild measure-theoretic considerations? What does 'mild' mean in this context?\n- You are interchangeably using | and \\mid in your densities, pick one.\n- Typo: 'indentifiability' under definition 3.2\n\n### Related work\n\n- Again, your definition of causal identifiability does not mean what you say it does.\n\n### Experiments\n\n- I am confused. In section 6.2 you are using the correct term 'causal discovery' and you are using the idea correctly as well, so why are you referring to the structure learning with 'identifiability' hitherto?\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Same here; _causal discovery_ is being used rather than identifiability."

                "value": "1) **The identifiability approach/results follow quite directly from previous works with some results already known previously** -- one could have assumed the results here to be already implied based on earlier works: the approach for proving MSM using mixtures model presentation is well known from the general work in [1] (which could be cited). While this specific class of models covered in this work is not explicitly mentioned, the results therein could be seen as already implying the identifiability of this type of models -- more explicit acknowledgement that this approach has been taken before would probably be sufficient (for the MSM results). The identifiabiltiy of SDSs with nonlinear activation function is just an application of the Kivva paper on this specific model class. Further identifiability of SDSs (in nonlinear ICA form) has actually already been established -- below point covers this more.\n\n2) **There are lacking citations and incorrect interpretations of previous works** -- if these are acknowledged appropriately the contributions of this paper would appear less significant. Most importantly, this paper claims that previous works have not considered identifiability in nonlinear dynamical systems with nonlinear emission function: specifically the authors state that \"In contrast, H\u00e4lv\u00e4 et al. (2021) assumes linear SDSs,\" -- this is not correct,  their identifiability results do not appear to make any such assumptions (based on my reading of their Theorems 1 and 2); their practical algorithm does seem to assume that but that has nothing to do with the identifiability. Identifiability of SDSs is thus achieved in their work. For identifiability of models with autoregressive transitions, see also [2], and the IIA-HMM model particularly -- I don't see this paper mentioned and discussed even though it has some similarity. In terms of estimation algorithm, the seminal work of [3] is not mentioned -- you need to at least explain why their work does not apply here or why the current approach is superior.\n\n3) **The identifiability results are weaker than acknowledged. or at least not sufficiently discussed** By directly relying on the result of Kivva to prove the identifiability of the nonlinear emission function / latent components, the results unfortunately inherit its weaknesses. 1) The identifiability requires one to know the family of the noise distribution which is a cumbersome assumption (but see Q2 below). 2) The results relies on piecewise linear emission function and is therefore less general than many other works that allow e.g. almost any injective $f(x)$ -- consider for instance what happens in your case if $f(x)$ is a Gaussian Process. 3) As far as I understand, that while there is no assumption of independence here (c.f. nonlinear ICA), the results are also clearly weaker i.e. for latent vector $\\mathbf{z}$ your results give essentially $f(\\mathbf{z}) = Af'(\\mathbf{z'}) + b$ -- contrast this to nonlinear ICA where one would identify the individual coordinates as per $z_i = h(z_i')$ for some invertible $h$ -- please correct if I have misunderstood. \n\n4) ** Experimental evaluation lacking in places**: The evaluation of the models on the salsa data seems very qualitative and much more rigorous evaluation would be preferred with some quantitative evaluation metrics.(Q3 below)\n\nmisc.:\n- \"p(z) is identifiable up to affine transformations\" -- This is imprecise language, explain whether you mean parameter identificaiton or identification of z or what.\n- Definition 2.1 define what $B$ is\n- grammar: \"The generative model consider in this work\" \n- Equation (4) and elswhere you use $p_a$ but earlier $p_{\\theta}$, please explain more clearly what the subscript $a$ means\n- Figure 2 is poor quality -- please provide a better quality figure\n- \"H\u00e4lv\u00e4 et al.
