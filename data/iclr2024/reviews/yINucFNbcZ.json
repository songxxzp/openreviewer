However, it is not clear whether this yields valid coverage. Since the resulting classifier $\\hat{g}$ uses calibration data to learn the weights $\\Theta$ the exchangeability between the calibration set and the test set is broken -- this is easy to see because information from the calibration set \"leaks\" into the weights $\\Theta$. To see this differently: if you swap one calibration point with one test point the learned weights will be different. This is equivalent to why we cannot use one dataset to both train and calibrate the base classifier $f$ and why we need to either use Split CP, or use the full conformal approach. To maintain validity 3 datasets are necessary under the split framework: one for training, one for learning the augmentation policy, and one for the final calibration. However, this comes at a trade-off were we have to use smaller sets which is the same trade-off that standard split CP suffers from.\n\nNote, the validity of the average variant is correct since here the exchangeability is maintained. \n\nNote also that the fact that the emprical coverage matches the nominal coverage is not a proof.\n\nThe statement \"We learn these weights using the calibration set by learning a set of weights that maximizes classifier accuracy by minimizing the cross-entropy loss computed between the predicted probabilities and true labels\" shows the second weakness. The weights are trained to maximize the accuracy. However, this is not necessarily alligned with the actual goal of CP. It has been shown that we obtain the smallest prediction sets when the predicted probabilities (for all classes) match the ground-truth oracle probabilities (see e.g. [1] or APS).  However, the cross-entropy loss leads to over-confidence for the true class and does not encourage that the rest of the probabilities are well calibrated. Using a different loss such as e.g.  the one proposed by Stutz et al. (2022) which is mentioned in the related work or [1] is likely to lead to further improvements. Given the limited technical contributions such further experimental analysis is warranted.\n\nGiven that the learned weights were anyways close to 0 as reported, using fixed weights is another solution that maintains validity.\n\n[1] \"Training Uncertainty-Aware Classifiers with Conformalized Deep Learning\" by Einbinder et al."

                "value": "This paper adresses the problem of producing large prediction sets commonly seen in current approaches of conformal prediction, by applying test-time augmentation to the computation of conformal scores. To compute the conformal score of a sample, the proposed method uses a linear combination of estimated probabilities given by the base classifier on the original data vector and its augmentations. The weights of this linear combination are either uniform or learned by minimizing the cross entropy loss on the calibration set, giving rise to two algorithmes correspondingly referred as TTA-Avg and TTA-Learned. \n\nAn extensive empirical study was carried out to show the effectiveness of test-time augmentation in reducing the prediction set size. The superiority of TTA-Learned over TTA-Avg is notably observed for the expanded augmentation policy where some augmentations not used in the training step are introduced in the calibration step."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- My biggest question about this work is on the assumption of data exchangeability in TTA-Learned. As the weights of augmentations in TTA-Learned are obtained by minimizing the cross entropy loss on the *calibration set*, there is a statistical dependence between the data in the calibration set and the learned weights of augmentations that are used to compute the conformal score. This means that calibration data and unseen exemples are not exchangeable with respect to the computation of conformal score. So I do not see how the assumption of exchangeability is preserved. If this point could be clarified, I would be willing to reconsider my score.  \n\n\n- As pointed out by the authors, it is understandable that TTA-Learned works better than TTA-Avg for the expanded augmentation policy as it allows the adjustment of the weights associated to the augmentations not included in the training. Meanwhile the results using APS reported in Table~4 show a close match between TTA-Learned and TTA-Avg. Could the authors provide some intuition behind that?"
