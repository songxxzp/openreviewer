                "value": "This paper sets out to provide a theoretical foundation for the benefits of pretraining on unsupervised data in the context of a broader downstream task. The central premise is that an unknown distribution, denoted as $p_{\\phi^*}$ and belonging to a known distribution family $\\phi^*\\in\\Phi$, generates pairs of data points $(x,z)$, where $x$ represents the input vector, and $z$ is a latent variable. Labels, or $y$ values, are stochastically determined solely by $z$ through an unknown distribution $p_{\\psi^*}$ from a known distribution family $\\psi^*\\in\\Psi$. Consequently, the pretraining procedure utilizes only observations of $x_j$s and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to acquire knowledge of $p(z|x)$, while the fine-tuning stage leverages labeled pairs $(x_i,y_i)$ to learn a straightforward classifier, $p(y|z)$.\n\nNotably, the authors introduce the concept of \"informativeness\" as a means to theoretically elucidate the learnability of $p(z|x)$ solely from observations of $x_j$s. The paper then goes on to present a set of generalization bounds that, while somewhat expected, offer a fresh perspective. These bounds are demonstrated in three distinct scenarios: 1) Factor models, 2) Gaussian Mixture Models, and 3) Contrastive Learning.\n\nThe mathematical analysis in this paper appears rigorous and well-founded, and the presented bounds seem to be a novel contribution. However, my skepticism arises regarding the extent to which this paper advances the theoretical understanding of pretraining, as discussed in the \"Weaknesses\" section. It's noteworthy that the improved generalization bounds are primarily a result of the significant assumptions made about the data generation process. In simpler terms, the authors first assumed the efficacy of pretraining, and then substantiated their own assumption.\n\nNonetheless, I believe that this paper could be a valuable addition to the Machine Learning Theory (MLT) community and might meet the standards for acceptance at ICLR. Therefore, my current inclination is toward a weak acceptance. However, I remain open to reconsidering my evaluation if the authors can more effectively emphasize the significance of their work."

                "value": "The authors present an analysis of the excess risk associated with a two-stage learning process: first pretraining on a large volume of unlabeled data ($m\\gg n$), followed by fine-tuning on a smaller labeled dataset. Their findings reveal that this excess risk is notably smaller compared to training solely on the initial set of $n$ labeled samples. While the presented bounds are mathematically rigorous and insightful, they do not significantly advance our theoretical understanding of the concept of pretraining per se. In essence, the generalization bounds align with conventional expectations: For a limited $n$ and assuming $m\\rightarrow\\infty$, the training of a small linear head generlizes far better than training the whole NN, therefore, one would naturally expect:\n$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{complexity}(head)/n}+\\sqrt{\\mathrm{complexity}(body)/m}\\ll \\sqrt{\\mathrm{complexity}(head+body)/n}.$ \n\nThe authors, in my opinion, do not definitively establish the \"advantage\" of pretraining, despite the paper's title. In my opinion, the efficacy of unsupervised pretraining primarily stems from its remarkable capacity to mitigate bias, rather than reducing the excess risk. However, the effect of bias is not present in this analysis. The authors postulate the existence of a latent variable, denoted as $z$, which imparts conditional independence between $x$ and $y$. This assumption underpins the essence of pretraining, but the underlying reasons for its practical effectiveness remain elusive. Additionally, the authors rely on the presumption that the \"true\" joint distribution of $x$ and $z$ adheres to a known class of probability distributions, typically those produced by sufficiently large neural networks, which can be learned using a generic estimator such as MLE. The question of why these assumptions hold in practice and whether they can be theoretically justified remains a mystery, and this study does not provide a resolution to this critical issue.\n\nDue to the aforementioned ungrounded assumptions, particularly in the context of theoretical rigor, the proofs and associated mathematical methodologies in this paper lack enough mathematical sophistication. The derived bounds rely on the application of well-established generalization guarantees pertaining to Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) and Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE).\n\nIn light of these concerns, I would suggest to rephrase both the title and abstract of the paper to accurately reflect the highlighted issues."

The authors present a versatile framework to analyze various unsupervised pretraining models, emphasizing its applicability across different setups like factor models, Gaussian mixture models, and contrastive learning. The primary contributions are:\n\nExcess Risk Bound: The authors present an upper bound on the excess risk associated with an algorithm (Algorithm 1). The risk is expressed in terms of various parameters, including the Rademacher complexity\u2014a measure that quantifies the function class's capacity to fit random noise.\n\nWeakly Informative Models: The paper introduces the concept of models that are $\\kappa^{-1}$-weakly-informative. These models, while not being fully informative, are shown to have certain desirable properties. The authors provide a relaxed assumption (Assumption 3.6) which broadens the class of examples by considering both the Total Variation (TV) and Hellinger distances to quantify the discrepancy between the model's outputs and the true distribution.\n\nPerformance Guarantees: Crucially, the authors demonstrate that the bounds provided on excess risk remain valid even under the $\\kappa^{-1}$-weakly-informative assumption (Theorem 3.7). This insight is significant as it indicates that despite the potential shortcomings of weakly informative models, one can still establish robust performance guarantees for them."

                "value": "### Weaknesses:\n\n**Over-reliance on Assumption 3.2:** \nThe primary weakness of this paper stems from assumption 3.2, which appears to be an overly robust condition. The core challenge of the paper lies in discerning the (constraint) relationship between (x, s) and (x, z). By introducing a new parameter, $\\kappa$, to simply constrain this relationship, the paper sidesteps the intricacy of this challenge. While the existence of such a parameter in the three sub-cases presented in the paper is addressed, its presence in more complex scenarios remains questionable. The use of such a strong assumption might detract from the general applicability of the results.\n\n**Potential Pitfalls with Transformation Assumption:** \nA significant concern arises from the implications of assumption 3.2. Based on the assumption, it can be inferred that given\n$$\\mathbb{P}\\_{\\phi}(x, s) = \\mathbb{P}\\_{\\phi^*}(x, s),$$\nthere exists a transformation $T_1$ such that\n$$\\mathbb{P}\\_{T\\_1 \\circ \\phi}(x, z) = \\mathbb{P}\\_{\\phi^*}(x, z).$$\n\nHowever, when considering mixed uniform distributions over specific cubical sets, these assumptions are immediately invalidated. This limitation highlights potential scenarios where the stated assumption may not be practically applicable.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvement:** \nIt would be beneficial for the authors to provide a more thorough justification or relaxation of assumption 3.2, possibly exploring weaker conditions that achieve similar results."

(which is often not satisfied in practice; see HaoChen et al. 2021), and the positive/negative signs are logistically distributed according to their latent similarity.
