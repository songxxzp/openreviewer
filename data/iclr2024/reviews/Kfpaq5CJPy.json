                "value": "This paper introduces a novel adversarial attack which relies on perturbing images in representation space such that, when this representation is inverted, we get an adversarial example in the pixel space. To this end, the authors create a framework where given an invertible transformation (DCT, DWT and GLOW are used in the paper), we can put an image through this transform and then separate out the most significant components of its representation. These important components are kept the same while the remaining components (presumed to be less important) are perturbed slightly. The space of these perturbations is such that when the perturbed representation is inverted, we get an adversarial example in pixel space (w.r.t the $\\infty$ norm).\n\nTo actually produce the adversarial examples, the authors follow a method similar to PGD except that they replace the \u2018projection\u2019 step in PGD by placing a constraint in their optimization problem. This is just the standard barrier function method from constrained optimization which makes sure that the iterates of the optimization remain within the set of possible outcomes (within the set of allowed perturbations in this case).\n\nThis, the authors show, produces adversarial examples which are closer to the original image in terms of L2, LPIPS etc distance. Next, the authors use their attack for adversarial training which helps the model robustify against image corruptions (such as blue, weather etc) with small losses in clean accuracy. Since the adversarial attacks were not tuned w.r.t these image corruptions, the authors show that their attack introduces robustness which transfers over to other tasks (image corruptions in this case)."

                "value": "My main concern about this paper revolves around the significance of the results.\n\nI would break down the results into 3 parts:\n1. First, the authors state that their attack produces adversarial examples which are closer to the original image than what we would get via PGD. This is measured via a number of distance metrics in pixel space (L2, LPIPS etc)\n2. Second, they then show that when their attack is used for adversarial training, we get only a small drop in clean accuracy (only a few % points). This to me seems expected, because, the images produced are very similar to the original images so the model makes fewer mistakes (Point 1 above). \n3. Next, the authors show that adversarial training using their attack introduces robustness to threat models which were not trained against originally. This is a very significant problem and, from what I\u2019ve seen, usually solved via some form of ensembling. However, the robustness introduced against image corruptions via this method falls short of what dedicated methods attain (this is a limitation pointed out by the authors to be fair and not to be held against them since they use a threat model agnostic method).\n\nFor Point 3 above, while the authors have shown that their method transfers better to image corruptions than vanilla PGD, there needs to be some control for the amount of image corruption added. As stated above, adversarial examples produced by the authors are closer to the original image. Hence, it might be possible that their method only performs better because the amount of corruption added to the image is too low and if more noise was added, vanilla PGD might become better.\nAdditionally, I would like to see the authors compare attacks with each other. If the claim is about the transferability of robustness, why not train the model with adversarial examples produced using their own attack and test them on adversarial examples produced via PGD? (And vice versa) Regardless of the outcome of this experiment, it would tell us something about the limits of transferability being claimed. \n\nI do think this paper contributes something meaningful methodologically (perturbing in representation space), however, it is unclear to me where or what this method is actually good at doing. This is the main reason behind my score below.\n\nMinor:\n1. There are several choices made throughout the paper which seem essential to making this technique work. It would be nice to have ablations over these choices to make the paper more rigorous experimentally. Some examples: choice of barrier function, size of \u2018e\u2019 in class conditional representations for GLOW etc.\n\nTypos:\n1. Page 1, Section \u201cIntroduction\u201d, Subsection \u201cAdversarial Robustness\u201d - \u201cattacks either by LEANING and embedding space using neural networks (Huang\u2026.)\u201d should be \u201cattacks either by LEARNING and embedding space using neural networks (Huang\u2026.)\u201d\n2. Page 2, Paragraph 2 - \u201cApproaches include again suitable data augmentation\u201d I presume should be \u201cApproaches include using suitable data augmentation\u201d\n3.

Page 5, Section 3, Subsection \u201cDWT\u201d - Capitalization \u201cAs for the DCT, and in JPEG2000, Similarly, we first perform\u201d should presumably be something like \u201cSimilar to the case of DCT for JPEG2000, we first perform\u201d. Note, this is just a suggestion and the authors might have been trying to communicate something else so feel free to use some other statement. The point of this was only to correct capitalization and grammar.\n5.  I think the second argument for $\\gamma$ in Eq 2 should be $R^{q}$ right? Because that is the domain of the \u2018a\u2019 values.\n\nFormatting: \n1. Title of section 4 \u201cExperimental Evaluation\u201d is the last line of the page. Ideally, the title should have some following text so that the document flows better."
