For example, in section 1 and in other spots, the memory of LoRA-FA is compared to full fine-tuning but not LoRA. Given that LoRA-FA is fundamentally a tweak of LoRA, the natural comparison should be to LoRA, not the full fine-tuning just to make the numbers look more impressive. To the authors: the benefits of LoRA-FA are moderate but clear; there is not need to oversell the method.\n- The crux of the evaluation lies in whether LoRA-FA underperforms LoRA, or performs comparably with reduced memory consumption. While the evaluations in the paper are quite comprehensive (spanning 3 model families), I think the current experiment still fall short of resoundingly answering this crucial question, and I would like to see the authors run a set of experiments to address this. To put this more explicitly: to determine if LoRA-FA underperforms LoRA (or not), we need a setting where LoRA is \"capacity-constrained\", to determine if LoRA-FA has even less \"capacity\" than LoRA. To do this, we need a setting where LoRA meaningfully underperforms full fine-tuning. For both the RoBERTa and T5 experiments, this is not the case. The LLaMA-7B experiments on Alpaca/FLAN -> MMLU come the closest to this, but the margin is still too small to tell (and essentially no gap at all in the case of Alpaca) (more broadly, MMLU is not a fine measure of LM performance). I can recommend the authors run a set of experiments on something like Super-NaturalInstructions, where there is likely to be a bigger gap (since the evaluation is performed on generated sequences rather than simple multiple-choice knowledge questions)."

In the finetuning phase, unlike the inference phase, both sequence length and batch size are longer, resulting in high GPU utilization. Therefore, it is not considered practically significant to make LoRA-FA more memory efficient than the existing LoRA.\n* I think efficient finetuning becomes more crucial as the model size increases. Therefore, it is necessary to demonstrate that as the model size grows, it shows performance similar to LoRA. However, the models experimented in the paper were limited to sizes up to 7B, which is relatively small. The trends in models larger than 7B remain unknown.\n* As I consider LoRA to be a comprehensive methodology that encompasses LoRA-FA, it is difficult to anticipate that LoRA-FA would exhibit better accuracy than LoRA.\n* The cost required for inference after finetuning is completed is the same for both LoRA and LoRA-FA."

This led to a drastic reduction in the memory usage of the optimizer state, bringing it down to megabytes. Thus, using fewer trainable parameters than LoRA does not yield a significant difference.\n* Regarding \"reducing the activation memory\", while LLaMA uses a max sequence length of 2k, the LLaMA2 model employs a 4k length. It's evident that models are gravitating towards longer sequence lengths. As per Table 1, LoRA-FA utilizes '2bsr' of memory (compared to LoRA's '2bsd+2bsr'), but the advantage in memory savings during training becomes less pronounced as the model's sequence length increases relative to LoRA.\n* The proposed methodology primarily targets the reduction of memory usage during training. In section 4.2, Table 5, the variance in memory peak between LoRA and LoRA-FA is minimal, especially for generative models like LLaMA-7B.\n* As stated in the LoRA paper, amplifying the trainable parameters doesn't notably affect accuracy (refer to Figure 2). For a more precise evaluation, I suggest the following comparative experiments with LoRA:\n    * Match LoRA and LoRA-FA at the same level of trainable parameters and then compare their accuracy and memory peaks.\n    * Adjust both LoRA and LoRA-FA to similar peak memory levels and compare their MMLU accuracy.\n    * Examine the peak memory usage of both LoRA and LoRA-FA when using generative models larger than LLaMA-7B to determine if the gap increases as the model size grows."
