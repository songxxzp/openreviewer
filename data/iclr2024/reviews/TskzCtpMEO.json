                "value": "The paper proposes a procedure for training sparse Bayesian neural networks with a factorized variational distribution. It does so by alternating between optimizing the parameters of a subset of the weight distributions, with the remaining ones zeroed out, and updating the subset of non-zero weights by adding to and removing from that subset based on a range of criteria. The experiments show improved accuracy and calibration on CIFAR10/100 over methods from the literature at higher sparsity.\n\nOverall, I would say that the paper introduces some reasonable but not ground-breaking technical material, however it is let down by a severely limited evaluation, omitting most standard uncertainty estimation benchmarks. With some further issues around overclaiming novelty, I would argue for rejecting the paper in its current form."

                "value": "1. the experiments are quite bare-bones for a BNN paper, there is no evaluation of predictive uncertainty besides calibration -- we don't need a Bayesian approach do well on this metric. I would either suggest adding e.g. a temperature scaling baseline applied to a sparse deterministic net or (preferably) the usual out-of-distribution and distribution shift benchmarks.\n2. primarily testing at a single sparsity level as in Table 2 also seems a bit limited to me. In my view, there are broadly two possible goals when using sparsity: opitimizing sparsity at a given performance level, e.g. close to optimal, or optimizing performance at a given sparsity level. I would have liked to see more figures in the style of Figure 2 left and Figure 3 to cover both of these settings also for the baselines.\n3. I would have liked to see a bit more in-depth investigation of the pruning criteria, e.g. a plot of Spearman correlations between the preferred score and the others throughout training or a correlation matrix at various stages (say beginning, halfway through and end of training). I must say that I am not overly convinced that they matter too much, the variation of accuracy in Fig 2 seems to be only about 0.5% (although see questions). So I think it might be worth saving the page discussing the criteria in fewer of more thorough experiments.\n4. the paper makes some rather inaccurate claims vs the existing literature. In particular, it is not the first paper introducing a \"fully sparse BNN framework that maintains a consistently sparse Bayesian model through- out the training and inference\", this statement also applies to the (Ritter et al., 2021) paper, which is incorrectly cited as a post-hoc pruning paper (the paper does use post-hoc pruning as an optional step to further increase sparsity, but the core low-rank parameterization is maintained throughout training). This doesn't affect the contribution of course, but prior work needs to be contextualized correctly.\n5. I don't really see the need to make such claims in the first place, it is not obvious that sparsity in training is desirable. Of course it may be the case that a larger network that would not fit into memory without sparsity performs better, but then this needs to be demonstrated (or like-wise any hypothetical training speed increases resulting from a reduced number of FLOPs - in the age of parallelized computation, that is a mostly meaningless metric if it cannot be shown that a practical implementation can lead to actual cost savings).\n6. the abstract is simultaneously wordy and vague. I did not know what the paper was doing specifically after reading it, even though it really isn't hard to describe the method in 1 or 2 sentences. I would say that the low-rank/basis terminology led me in the wrong direction of thinking and a pruning-based description would have been clearer, but this may of course differ for readers with a different background."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- how are the mean values initialized for weights that are added to the active set? I assume 0? Do you reuse the old value if a weight had been temporarily removed?\n- I'm not sure I follow the discussion of Figure 2 right. For the initialization of the variance of a mean-field Gaussian, identical considerations apply as for the initialization of weights in deterministic networks, so loosely speaking we want to scale the sum of variance of the means and the initial value of the variance parameter inversely with the number of units to avoid the activations diverging with increasing depth. So to me it seems natural, that dense VI would reach this critical threshold before a pruned variance, as the latter is simply removing terms from a positive sum and thus decreasing variance. Am I missing something/misinterpreting the figure?\n- Can you demonstrate any practical benefits from sparsity during training/the FLOP reduction translating to real time speedups?\n\nFor suggestions see weaknesses."

                "value": "The paper proposes a novel inference method for sparse Bayesian neural networks based on variational inference, namely Sparse Subspace Variational Inference (SSVI). The idea, that is different to the previous sparse BNNs, is to explicitly keep the number of non-zero weights in the neural network fixed while updating which weights are included or excluded as non-significant. This is in contrast to the existing literature, where sparsity is induced by special priors and, firstly, still starts with a dense model that is sparsified during training, which still make inference during training computationally expensive. Secondly, sparsity-inducing priors do not allow to set a specific level of sparsity, which may require a user to play with hyperparameters of the prior to get the desired level of sparsity. The proposed method has a level of sparsity as a hyperparameter and it is fixed from the start of the training, saving computational efforts from the start. Experiments in CIFAR-10/100 show the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to other sparse NNs in accuracy, loss, ECE, and training FLOPs."
