            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the idea of adapter is interesting, a key problem of the paper is that it fails to demonstrate that it can improve IR performance. As the experimental results show, the method can only improve on some of the datasets. The advantage of the method is not demonstrated.\nThe experiments have been carried out on small datasets. The authors argue that retrieval on a small dataset is a particular problem that warrants more explorations. It is unclear why this is the case, and why a retriever that works on large datasets may not be directly applied to small datasets.\nThe authors also argue that the existing investigations in IR have focused on large ranked lists, and this paper target small ranked lists (considered to be more strict). Again, it is unclear why this size of output is a particular problem. In many previous studies, evaluations have looked at not only tok-K with large K, but also top-K with small K (NDCG@1, NDCG@5, ...). They are not so different from the measures used in this paper. In addition, the paper does not propose a specific method for retrieving only a few documents. So, the difference between large and small K is not so important, and the difference (if any) is not addressed in the paper.\nThe authors only compared the proposed method with a basic LLM-based retriever. The latter may not be a state of the art of IR. It would be interesting to compare with other baselines such as ANCE and DPR. It would be interesting to also compare the adapter-based method with a fine-tuning-based method. I understand that fine-tuning a LLM with limited examples may not be easy to do or may not be effective. However, to support the argument that adapter is a better solution than fine-tuning, the comparison may be useful.\nThere may be more analysis of the experimental results. The results are mitigated. Although some possible explanations are provided, one still wonder why improvements/degradations are produced in different cases. Would this be also related to the number of training data?\nThe concept of heterogeneous datasets is misleading. One could understand that the dataset contains several types of data. The case of NL queries and code dataset is not a real heterogeneous dataset. This is more similar to cross-media retrieval. The proposed method does not seem to be capable of handling truly heterogeneous datasets."

                "value": "This work addresses the problem of highly accurate retrieval of a small number of text documents from a relatively small corpus when the query and the corpus are from different domains. It is motivated by the recent interest in retrieval-augmented generation applications involving LLMs where a small number of highly relevant documents are used to provide additional context to the generative task specified by the query. The work argues that classical document retrieval methods are not useful for such applications due to domain mismatch between the query and the corpus, task specificity of retrieval and stricter requirement for retrieval efficacy in the top retrieval results. The work assumes that in such applications, the target corpus is of small size (a few thousand documents) and that a limited number of examples of \"good\" retrievals (a few thousand) are available for this corpus.\n\nIt proposes a solution to the problem that consists of transforming pretrained embeddings for the query and corpus documents. Specifically, the work proposes to do a parameter efficient finetuning of pretrained embeddings without accessing the weights of the pretrained embedding model and using only a small sized tuning data set that consists of examples of \"good\" retrievals. Towards this the work proposes augmenting the pretrained embedding model with small adapter models that can learnt from the small tuning data set. Given the query (document), the adapters compute a perturbation vector by looking up a learnable dictionary which is then added to the pretrained embedding of the query (document). \n\nThe dictionary used for softmaxed lookup is small in size and learnt from the tuning data set (consisting of examples of \"good\" retrievals). The dictionary is learnt by enforcing that the perturbed/adapted embedding of q is closer to that of c than to global hard negatives for q in the corpus.\n\nThe work presents results from an experimental study to evaluate the value added by the proposed method on  five relatively small BEIR Datasets. It employs OPENAI ADA embeddings as the baseline retrieval system as well as the pretrained black-box embedding for adaptation. Retrieval efficacy is measured using NDCG @1, 3, 5 and 10. Though adaptation seems to improve retrieval performance in some cases, there is no clear winner. In some cases adapting only query embedding seems to be better, in some other cases adapting both query and corpus embeddings seems to be better (SciFact) and in other cases not adapting seems to be better (FiQA). The differences in gains are attributed to the differences in alignment of the notion of semantic similarity learnt by OPENAI ADA with what is intended in the benchmarks.\" However, there is no detailed analysis of the errors to validate this hypothesis.\n\nThe work also presents results from another experimental study on retrieval tasks involving natural language queries and corpus of code fragments. The gains are impressive on one dataset (SMCALFLOW), positive but marginal on another (BASH) and negative on the third (CONALA)."

It doesn't need access to the weights of the pretrained embedding model and pretraining embedding model need not be retrained.\n\n2.

Though the pretrained embedding model is treated as a black box, adaptation is still strictly tied to the specific pretrained embedding model and needs to be done separately for each pretrained embedding model. As the pretrained embedding model changes over time due to retraining/continual updating, the adapters also need to be retrained. \n\n2. The work assumes that in many applications, the target corpus is of small size (a few thousand documents) and that a limited number of examples of \"good\" retrievals (a few thousand) are available for this corpus. This is however a restrictive assumption. Typically the corpus is several orders larger in size than the available number of \"good\" retrievals. \n\n3. Improvements in retrieval efficacy is not impressive. The proposed approach is not a clear winner always. It is also clear what is the best improvement one can hope to get from this line of attack. Is the lack of large training data sets the major hurdle for significant further improvement or there are inherent limitations in the methodology? Even if large amount of training data were available, the global hard negatives idea employed would not work as is.\n\n4. There is no study of the improvement brought by the proposed adapter-based retrieval approach to RAG tasks."

The retrieval is heterogeneous in the sense that the query may be in natural language while the corpus may contain code, documentation, structured, and semi-structured text, or artifacts. The retrieval problem is also said to be strict because of the increased importance of a few top candidates. The strict retrieval may be important because of the limited context window and positional bias of the LLMs in RAG. The proposed method involves using adapters that perturb the general-purpose embeddings of the query (and in one variation, the corpus) to achieve task-specific improvements. The adapters, whose parameters can be learned using a small task-specific training dataset, add residual terms to the lower rank of the general-purpose embeddings for task-specific adaptation. The parameters of the adapters are learned with a contrastive loss. The proposed approach is compared with general-purpose LLM-based embeddings on classical and heterogeneous retrieval tasks."
