The main pursuit is to approximately estimate the dual OT distance via the neural networks with significant capacity and provide an explicit retrieval form for the OT plan/map. To overcome the limitation in marginal distribution conservation, this paper introduces unbalanced OT to obtain a relaxed plan and then recovers the balanced OT from a reweighting view. Theoretical results are provided to connect the re-weighted OT and UOT and ensure the feasibility of recovering the Monge map from neural UOT. Experiments are conducted from several perspectives, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed method."

                "value": "1. As far as I understand this paper, the basic goal is to address the potential mismatch induced by the imbalanced weights of different domains; more precisely, the imbalance means the mass proportion of the ideal transport pairs is different. Such a scenario is also analogous to the label shift problem, which is usually considered in OT methodology. To address this problem, there are two natural and common solutions: relaxation (i.e., UOT) or reweighting (i.e., adjusting the marginal distribution) [r1, r2]. Since this work adopts relaxation as a solution (while also noting that the idea of reweighting is also implicitly shown in Sec. 3.1), I think more justification and discussion on the related fields are highly expected.\n\n2. Based on the reweighting solution mentioned above, can the imbalanced mass problem be addressed by detecting the degree of shifting mass (i.e., estimating the weights in Sec. 3.1) and solving the reweighting (balanced) OT? If it is feasible, what will be the advantages and weaknesses of the proposed methods?\n\n3. As the basic problem is similar to label shift, the experiments on related problems are highly appreciated. For example, the generalized label shift scenario [r1] and partial domain adaptation [r2] (which can be taken as an extreme scenario for label shift), where the comparison methods for corresponding tasks should also be carefully considered.\n\n4.
