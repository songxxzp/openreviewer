The authors find a mixture of effects of margins in contrastive learning through gradient analysis. Then they separate each effect to validate its effect and limitation. Finally, the authors propose to emphasize positive samples and scale gradients based on positive sample angles and logits to improve contrastive learning. They evaluate the effectiveness on multiple datasets and conduct extensive ablation studies."

So using margin to overly push them apart will harm the representation learning. So how the authors think about that problem?  \n2.The proposed method is too simple and not systematic. Although the authors provide detail analysis on angular margin and subtractive margin, they did not provide any improved operations.  \n3.How hyper-parameter s scales positive sample gradients in Equation 8 and 9? These variables seem to have nothing to do with the gradient."

The intuition is not very clearer to reviewer, could you please explain? Also why 'these margins are added only to positive samples' (as in Sec 3.2)?\n\n- The in-text references are quite strange / messy.\n\n- Some sentences, due to its longer nature, are hard to understand. For example, In the last paragraph of the Introduction section, 'We believe that understanding how margins affect contrastive learning can provide direction for ... Not only that, we believe our new perspective on margins could ...'\n\n- The contributions listed in the Introduction section are too vague, e.g., the second contribution is not very clear to review, could you please explain it and make it clear?\n\n- Related work section, the writing quality is very poor, e.g., MoCo He et al. SimCLR Chen et al, BYOL Grill et al, etc. It might because of the in-text reference issues again.\n\n- In the related work section, the authors only presented some literature review, and the differences w.r.t. the existing works versus the proposed solution are not highlighted. This is a noteworthy shortcoming. Moreover, there are not any in-depth discussions w.r.t. the proposed solution.\n\n- In the approach section, as a theoretical paper, it is suggested to have a notation section detailing the maths symbols used in the paper, e.g., for vectors, matrices, etc.\n\n- The reviewer is confusing w.r.t. Sec 5.2 'The larger the batch size, the more the performance curve becomes similar to that of MoCo'.\n\n- What is the baseline performance in Fig. 5 and 6, is it possible to show it in the figures as well? Also, the figures are a kind of unclearer enough due to it is a bit too tiny and cluttered.\n\n- Are there any insights and discussions w.r.t. why the experimental results are not very consistent across different datasets as in Table 2 & 3. What are the factors that affect this behavior?\n\n- Sec. 6, the limitations and discussion is a bit too limited. It does not convey useful insights to readers, would it possible to make it nicer and deliver some fruitful insights and discussions?\n\n\nMinor:\n\n- Figure 3, first row 4 figures, the x axis, numbers are nearly disappeared."

And it cannot make any insightful points like 'large-margin contrastive learning with distance polarization regularizer, ICML 2021'. Replacing infoNCE with large-margin softmax directly cannot help us understand contrastive learning. Because in large-margin softmax, we do not have false negative pair but in contrastive learning we have. So the only reason large-margin softmax will help us in CL should only be semi-hard mining mechanisim.\n\n3. The gradient analysis is trivial. Because it cannot provide any insightful point and prove it (please check \"On The Inadequacy of Optimizing Alignment and Uniformity in Contrastive Learning of Sentence Representations, ICLR2023\"). At least this paper provides a point based on the gradient analysis.\n\n4. This paper lost so many important citations and has no comparison with the related methods of contrastive learning with margin. For example, the large-margin softmax should be from \"large-margin softmax loss for convolutional neural networks, ICML2016\"."
