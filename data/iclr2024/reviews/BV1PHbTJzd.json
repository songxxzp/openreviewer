            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Under the paragraph below (3), the author tries to explain why SRRW gets its name. More specifically, they said `` if node $j$ has been visited more often, so far, the entry $x_j$ becomes larger (than target value $\\mu_j$ )\u2019\u2019. I didn\u2019t understand the logic behind it. If node $j$ has been visited more often, I think $x_j$, as the coordinate of a distribution vector, should be close to $\\mu_j$. I can\u2019t tell whether $x_j$ is larger than $\\mu_j$ or not.\u2028\u2028However, I acknowledge that the nonlinear kernel in (3) would encourage the algorithm to visit the states that are less visited, based on its expression.\n\n2. The newly introduced iterate in (4b) generalizes the original algorithm and allows us to treat the resulting algorithm as a two-time-scale SA. However, I didn\u2019t see much motivation to introduce the new iterate. Could the author elaborate more on the motivation?\n\n3. If we set $\\alpha=\\infty$, from (6), the variance matrix would be zero. Could I say, in this case, $x_n$ actually converges to $\\mu$ at a faster rate than $\\gamma_n$ so that the CLT degenerates to zero? How to explain the intuition behind it? \n\n4. From the simulation, it seems the larger $\\alpha$, the faster convergence. Is there any suggestion for a practical choice of $\\alpha$?\n\n5. If the $\\alpha$ is also updated, for example, we use $\\alpha_t$ at the iterate $t$ that increases at a carefully selected rate in advance (or perhaps could be updated using a third iterate). Can we accelerate the convergence rate of $\\theta_n$ so that its mean square error is faster than $\\beta_n$?\n\nI will increase my point to 8 if most of my questions are addressed.\n\n------------------------------------ Post rebuttal --------------\n\nThanks for the authors' clarification.  Most of my concerns and questions are well addressed, so I increase my point to 8.\nHowever, there are still two points I don't agree with the author.\n\nOne point I disagree with is that I think when $\\alpha \\to \\infty$, the kernel (3) is still well defined.\nIn this case, I think $K_{ij}(x) = 1$ if and only if $x_j/\\mu_j = \\arg\\min_{l} x_l/\\mu_l $.\nAs you can see, this kernel is reduced to a deterministic transition. \nI guess this reduction makes the system no longer random so that the CLT degenerates.\nOne property of this generation is that the variance matrix would converge to zero.\nThis actually is a good property from my perspective because it means that one could get a convergence rate faster than the step size.\n\nLet's do a simpler thought experiment. Let $X_t \\sim \\sqrt{\\beta_t} \\cdot N(0, c_t )$.\nIf the variance $c_t$ is non-zero (so that $c_t \\to 1$ w.l.o.g.), then the MSE of $X_t$ is dominated by the variance and is of order $\\beta_t$. \nIf the variance is (nearly) zero (say $c_t \\to 0$), then the MSE is dominated by a higher-order term and we have $E |X_t|^2$ converge faster than $\\beta_t$.\n\nBack to this paper, I guess the counterpart of $c_t$ in this paper is $1/\\alpha$. So, if we let $\\alpha \\to \\infty$, we would have $c_t \\to 0$. This is the reason why I ask whether increasing $\\alpha$ would fasten the convergence. The author's response works only when the optimal $\\alpha^{\\star}$ exists and is finite. However, the particular case I am interested in is when $\\alpha^{\\star} = \\infty$.\nI think that exploring the case where  $\\alpha^{\\star} = \\infty$ detailedly is worth a more detailed examination. \nIt is fine not to discuss this in this paper."

There exists a finite space $\\mathcal{N}$ and some kind of \"random walk\" $\\{X_n\\}_{n\\in\\N}$ over this set. One then takes $\\theta_0\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ and a function $H:\\mathbb{R}^d\\times \\mathcal{N}\\to \\mathbb{R}^d$ and sets \n\n$$\\theta_{n+1} = \\theta_n + \\beta_n\\,H(\\theta_n,X_n).$$\n\nOne particular example is when $X_n\\sim \\mu$ and $H(\\theta,i) = -\\nabla f(\\theta,i)$ for some $f$. Then the above is basically a form of stochastic gradient descent for the function\n\n$$F(\\theta) :=\\sum_i \\mu_i\\,f(\\theta,i).$$\n\nThe authors say that $X_n$ may be thought of as a \"token\", so they are considering token distributed optimization methods. \n\nThe authors are especially interested in the case where $X_n$ is a stochastic process called \"self-repellent random walk\". Basically, this kind of RW have asymptotic distribution $\\mu$, but they are designed to be less likely to jump to states that have already been visited many times. A recent paper by Doshi et al. showed that such random walks lead to smaller-variance Monte Carlo estimates of expectations with respect to $\\mu$. In fact, the variance in this case decreases like $\\alpha^{-1}$, where $\\alpha>0$ measures the amount of self-repulsion. \n\nThe present paper builds on this to show a remarkable result. Namely, under suitable conditions, $\\theta_n$ converges to a fixed point $\\theta_*$ (in expectation) of the iteration, and $\\theta_n - \\theta_*$ has variance decrease when $\\alpha$ grows. In fact, the variance goes down like $1/\\alpha^2$ for large $\\alpha$. In particular, this implies that self-repellent walks are \"even better\" for optimization or fixed point computations than for Monte-Carlo integration. However, this main result requires on tuning $\\beta_n$ to be smaller than a parameter describing the rate of change of the \"self-repulsion measure\". In fact, the authors show that, when this is not the case, it may be that a large $\\alpha$ will not help at all. The paper's proofs build on Doshi et al and rely on stochastic approximation methods."

                "value": "There are some questions that I hope the authors can address.\n1) Could the authors comment a little bit more on the stability of the iterates? This is assumed to always hold, but as the authors point out, practical tricks are required to ensure this, in which case the theoretical analysis might also need tweaks.\n2) Are there any tradeoffs in picking $\\alpha$? Should $\\alpha$ always be as large as possible, or will that affect other aspects of the algorithm, e.g. stability?\n3) While the analysis is on asymptotic covariance, could the authors comment on the likely finite-time convergence rate behavior of their SRRW-SA algorithm, and whether improvements (due to the SRRW) can be also shown in terms of finite-time convergence rates?\n4) The authors suggest that $\\beta_n = o(\\gamma_n)$ is the best step-size choice if a $O(1/\\alpha^2)$ decay rate in the asymptotic covariance is desired. However, if faster convergence is to be desired, a larger learning rate (i.e. larger $\\beta_n$) should always be picked, i.e. we would want to pick the maximal possible step-size required by the assumptions in the paper, i.e. $\\beta_n = O(1/n^{0.5+\\epsilon})$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$ as close to 0 as possible, in which case $\\gamma_n$ can at best match the step-size of $\\beta_n$, meaning that we can only get $O(1/\\alpha)$ in the asymtotic covariance decay again. Could the authors comment on this possible issue?\n5) It would be nice if the authors provided some intuition as to why the $\\beta_n = o(\\gamma_n)$ step-size ratio can yield the $O(1/\\alpha^2)$ rate. Moreover, it would be nice if the authors spelled out precisely the dependence on the difference between the step-size exponents in their asymptotic rates (i.e. if  $\\beta_n = n^{-b}$ and $\\alpha_n = n^{-a}$, how the rate actually depends on the difference between $a$ and $b$). If this difference does not affect the asymptotic rate, it would be nice to provide insight into how this difference might play out in practice."
