The paper is difficult to understand: it is not well organized and leaves out many details.\n\na) Figure 1 is too abstract and symbolic to be understood.\n\nb) The authors refer to Figure 2 to illustrate the need for recall without further explanation.\n\nc\uff09Tempered Bayesian updates is a key component of the fast learner, but is not introduced. \n\nd) There are some details missing from the proof. For example, the proof of Lemma A.2. applies Hoeffding's lemma directly, but the derivation is not straightforward, making it difficult to verify the correctness of the theory.\n\ne) Important details, such as the derivation of Algorithm 2 and the definition of Adaptiveness are provided in Appendix, making it difficult to understand when reading the main text.\n\n\n\n2. The discrepancy between the motivation and the algorithm.\nAs mentioned, \"The primary goal is to activate the relevant slow learner for improved performance on seen tasks, and to utilize the fast learner for identifying and quickly learning new tasks.\" \n\nHowever, there is no new task identification in the proposed algorithms. There is also no identification of relevant slow learners in Algorithm 1.\nIn Algorithm 1, the recall and refinement do not seem to leverage the knowledge of the recurrence of tasks. They are both updated by simply combining $\\tilde{f}$ and $g$ with predefined ratios. \n\n3. This paper does not discuss and compare the methods proposed for the very related setting where data of previous tasks/classes may appear again in CL, such as blurry task setting like \"Koh et al. Online continual learning on class incremental blurry task configuration with anytime inference. In ICLR 2022\", or the methods using fast and slow learner \"Pham et al. DualNet: Continual Learning, Fast and Slow. In NeurIPS 2021\"\n\n4. Inappropriate choice of baselines in the experiments.\nIn Adaptive CL setting, there are no explicit task boundaries or identities. However, most baselines are not task-free methods. They are proposed under the assumption that there is an explicit task boundary, so they may not naturally work well in this setting. On the other hand, in Table 2, the only task-free baseline performs much better than the proposed method. The proposed method should be compared with more task-free baselines.\n\n5.

Why does it have almost the same number of trainable parameters as the other methods?\n\n3. We do not know the number of distributions. Therefore we don't know $m_{t-1}$. How is $m_{t-1}$ obtained in Algorithm 2? \n\n4. In the experiment, how many slower learners are there at the end of training?"

The reviewer only has the following minor concerns.\n\n1.\tThe method is verified on the classification task, as the problem setting is basically constructed according to label. The reviewer is wondering whether it is also applicable for regression problem. A related question is how to formulate the problem setting for regression task?\n\n2.\tThe ablation studies can be further improved by considering each process only. From the current results, exploration plays the major role in achieving good results, and thus it is necessary to include exploration only results.\n\n3.\tFor hyper-parameters Q and \\alpha, why the current value range is selected? The appendix gives partial results on several combination of these two hyper-parameters, and it can be observed that the performance indeed varies with different settings. It is necessary to include a constructive guideline to set the two hyper-parameters, especially when facing new task or datasets."

It's also confusing why the third Refinement (blue lines) occurs before the second Recall (green arrows).\n>- In Section 3.3, it\u2019s unclear what the `scalability challenges' refer to. In Algorithm 2, the notation $\\beta_{t-1,i}$ is also not explained.\n>- At the time (t+1), it's not clear why the slow learners have the correct $m_t$ models, especially considering that Section 1.1 asserts that the method doesn't require knowledge of the task count. Is $m_t$ also indicative of the number of components in the GMM model? The paper needs to provide a more detailed explanation of how the GMM model is updated and how the relevant slow learner is selected in Figure 3. \n- In the experimental section, the methods chosen for comparison are outdated. Considering that the proposed method incorporates the concept of the complementary system and emphasizes task-free CL, it should at least be compared with closely related methods such as Cls-ER[3] and recent task-free methods like [4].
