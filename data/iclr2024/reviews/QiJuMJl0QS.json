This trainable routing network is parameterized by input embeddings learned via the prototypical loss (Snell et al., 2017), in which the centroids encode the prototype shuffling parameters corresponding to each task. The method is favorable compared to using Gumbell-Sinkhorn layers (Mena et al., 2018) which use routing embedding dimensions quadratic in the number of channels, hence requiring larger networks with more parameters and longer inference times. The proposed method is also empirically compared to a few other baseline algorithms that do not account for heterogeneity, matching SOTA performance in single task regime and outperforming alternatives in the heterogeneous task setup."

Specifically, in order to define an ordering of $C$ channels one should require no more than $C$ values (each with at least $\\log_2C$ bits). I suspect that one can derive a (continuous) shuffling using embeddings of size $C$ instead of $C \\log C$ by using a sorting network (e.g. Bitonic sort) in a similar fashion as the Benes network is used in this work, but with a different switch type: $(U_j, channel_j)$ pairs are sorted by the key values and deltas between key values (passed a sigmoid) can form continuous switches. Can such a mechanism work in the use cases presented by the paper, and how would it compare to using the MRM-GB in terms of parametrization and evaluation speed?"

Whereas, many meta-learning models focus on the tasks coming from the same distribution (homogeneous), the authors consider the directly the tasks coming from a multi-modal task distribution (heterogeneous setting). Recently, many appeared many methods that tackle the heterogeneous meta-learning, but they suffer from a significant increase in parameter complexity. As an alternative approach, the authors propose a novel strategy which incorporates modulating the routing between convolution channels in the network. The paper introduce a novel neural neural permutation layer based on the classical Benes routing network. Finally, the proposed method is compared against various meta-learning benchmarks."
