                "value": "This paper studies the examplar-free class incremental learning (EFCIL) problem. The author is motivated by the cold-start scenario, i.e., the first task is insufficiently large to learn a high-quality backbone and thus demands the method to be more plastic to adapt their backbone to learn new tasks. Moreover, the author thinks existing methods in EFCIL pose too strong a regularization to restrict the model to be plastic, like the EWC in parameter space and the L2 regularization in feature space. To give the model more plasticity in learning new tasks, the author proposes a new method called the empirical feature matrix (EFM), which is a variant of the empirical fisher matrix in that the author calculates the square of the derivative over the feature extractor instead of the whole network and uses this as a regularization term to penalize the change in feature space. Moreover, the author combines both the prototype rehearsal and prototype drift compensation from existing works via the proposed EFM to create an asymmetric prototype rehearsal loss to provide elastic feature consolidation. Extensive experiments are conducted on the standard continual learning benchmarks and the author also compares with state-of-the-art EFCIL methods and provides further analysis."

In the definition provided by the author in the Introduction:\n\n\"In this paper we consider EFCIL in the more challenging Cold Start scenario in which the first task is insufficiently large to learn a high-quality backbone and methods must be plastic and adapt their backbone to new tasks.\"\n\nFirst, how to quantify the term \"insufficiently large\"? The reviewer sees that the author uniformly distributes all classes among all tasks in the Experiments, which means like 10 or 5 classes learned in step 1 for CIFAR-100. However, such experimental protocols are widely used in existing CL literature (e.g., see [1] and its follow-up works), which should be a *standard* experimental protocol for benchmarking CL. Moreover, how can the author confirm that 10 classes can not be a \"sufficiently large\" task? What criteria that the author explicitly measure whether a task is \"sufficient\" or \"insufficiently\" large? \n\nSecond, how can the author confirm that the backbone is not of \"high quality\"? What quality does the author refer to? The quality of learning the current tasks or the quality of learning the new tasks? Why does the model need to have more plasticity for learning the new task if the model is not of \"high quality\"? One can also say that the model has **exactly high plasticity** for learning new tasks given that the model has **only** learned for 5-10 classes given the overparameterized property of the modern CNN/DNN. \n\nOverall, the definition of the so-called \"cold-start\" scenario and the corresponding motivations that lead the author to propose the current method are not solid and sound. This paper may still stand out even if we do not mention the so-called \"cold-start\" scenario at first and instead only talk about the strong regularization effect made by existing methods and thus demand more flexible regularization methods. Then what is the necessity of this \"cold-start\" scenario? \n\nLast but not least, from the convention in machine learning, cold-start scenarios often refer to scenarios where we do not have any data to start with, e.g., for the recommendation system. With 5-10 classes (which means thousands of images) for training the model can hardly be thought of as a \"cold\" start.\n\n2. The details of Figure 2 are missing. What dataset and experimental protocols have the author used? Will the conclusion be influenced by the number of classes? Will the number of training data in the initial task have an impact on the conclusion? The author should provide the mean and std and repeat experiments to support this empirical observation.\n\nMinor:\n1.

                "value": "This paper is on the topic of continual learning. Specifically, it addresses the popular scenario of Class Incremental Learning (CIL). Within CIL, it assumes two of the most challenges constraints: (1) no exemplar/rehearsal memory (in which samples from past tasks are stored in memory and used to supplement training of new tasks) is permitted (EFCIL) and (2) the size of the first task is not large - the authors call this cold-start.  The paper takes careful note of both main challenges in continual learning: forgetting, and inter-task confusion, and weaknesses in past method, EWC. The new approach proposed aims to address both challenges, and the weakness of EWC: the strategy is to define a loss function that mitigates forgetting (by regularization of features rather than  weights) but still allows for plasticity, to ensure the new task can be learned.  The net result is the loss stated in Equation (15).  From ablation studies on split CIFAR-100, this new loss is sufficient to outperform comparison methods on the cold start scenario by large margins. But the papers adds an addition trick to perform even better: the use of prototype updates.  The new losses are supported by careful theoretical derivations."

The appendices are well written, comprehensive and support the paper well.

                "value": "I only have one weakness within the material presented: I would prefer to see ablations for more than just one dataset. In particular, in Fig 4, only CIFAR-100 is seen, in Table 2, only TinyImageNet. Figure 4(b) tells me that the EFM+PR-ACE loss is enough by itself (i.e. without prototype rehearsal) for better results than comparison methods on cold startup. But is this also true for the other datasets?\n\nSince I only have one weakness to list on the contributions of the paper, I'll take the opportunity to make a mild critique of two weaknesses (in my opinion) in the assumptions that are made in the problem setup in this paper, and in much related work in continual learning.\n\n1. Recently some of the community have started to question the frequent assumption that we need CL methods because storage of data is expensive, or unavailable due to privacy. See for example https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09253 \n    - I understand there's very little space to discuss the arguments for and against the importance of \"exemplar free\" but it would be better to at least acknowledge that there's some debate on this.\n\n2. This paper, and many others like it, seek a CL method that trains a network from a random initial state. However, in practical industry settings, it's nearly always better to consider transfer learning, which for an image classifier has for a long time meant starting with a model trained on ImageNet, but nowadays is also meaning self-supervised pre-training. It's puzzling why the CL community ignore this for the most part. This might be changing now, with a bunch of papers in 2023 now doing CIL with pretrained ViT models (and also ResNets - e.g. your cited ref Panos et al). It could be a simple experiment to try this and assess the benefits of using your method in this different assumption. I am raising to highlight a potential opportunity, and to recommend you at least mention your assumption of the need to train a model from scratch rather than use pre-trained weights."

An essential contribution of this research is the establishment of a pseudo-metric in feature space generated by a matrix termed the Empirical Feature Matrix (EFM). Unlike the Fisher Information Matrix, the EFM can be easily stored and computed as it is independent of the number of model parameters, relying solely on the dimensionality of the feature space. To tackle the drift of the more flexible backbone, it also proposes an Asymmetric Prototype Replay loss (PR-ACE) that strikes a balance between new-task data and Gaussian prototypes during EFCIL. Lastly, it presents an enhanced method for updating class prototypes that leverages the already-computed EFM."
