I-JEPA is designed to predict missing patch representations in the representation space. Dense-JEPA offers two straightforward extensions to improve the target representations of masked patches.\n\n- Dense-JEPA initially retrieves patches that are 'semantically' similar to a target patch within a specified local neighborhood.\n- It subsequently generates an aggregate representation for a target patch employing cross-attention mechanisms on the 'semantically' similar patches. Symmetrically, it also generates locally aggregated representations for the predicted patches and matches them to the new aggregated target.\n\nThe paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of Dense-JEPA across a wide range of tasks, including ImageNet classification, ADE20K/COCO segmentations/detections, DAVIS video object segmentation, and Clevr object counting and depth prediction. The results consistently demonstrate that Dense-JEPA outperforms I-JEPA and other masked image modeling approaches when using similar model sizes.\n\nMoreover, this work underscores the significance of careful consideration regarding the selection and computation of targets when conducting masked image modeling in the representation space."

It appears that the cross-attention operation is performed, with the query being the average patch representation of the target x_t (or context (x_c), and the key/value being the semantically similar patches {x_j}_{j\\in P_i} (or the entire context s_x). However, it's not entirely clear how distinct representations are obtained for each spatial location, given that the query is shared across all locations? Could you please clarify the computations performed by the local-aggregation layer?\n\nAdditionally, while the findings are well-supported in the explored settings, it remains uncertain whether they would generalize to other learning frameworks, such as masked-image auto-encoders, or if they hold true for larger-scale models. It would be valuable to include a section in the manuscript discussing these limitations."

                "value": "1) The results are not surprising, dense self-supervised learning has been explored extensively in the literature, and the same conclusion and gains on segmentation tasks have already been observed. DenseCL [1] uses a contrastive loss function to match local vectors. VICRegL [2] combines local and global aggregation and uses a similar nearest neighbour search for semantically similar patches. ODIN [3] computes segmentation masks online and aggregates the patches corresponding to the same regions. These papers are not mentioned or cited, I would therefore recommend to do a more extensive literature review, and highlight the novelty within the dense SSL literature.\n\n2) There is no comparison with DINO on most of the tasks. The DINO family of methods [4,5] has shown that dense loss functions might actually not be required to learn very good dense features, and offers the best performance on local tasks as of today. For example, on DAVIS-2017, DINO reports 61.8 J&M with a ViT-S/16, while the best number reported in the paper is 58.3 with a much larger ViT-L backbone. On classification on ImageNet, a DINOv2 ViT-L model is over 86 points. The gains over I-JEPA are interesting, but the overall performance is very far from the state-of-the-art. MAE is not really a good baseline as it performs very poorly on frozen tasks, which are standard to evaluate SSL methods.\n\n3) The gains over I-JEPA are probably not worth the complexity. The paper is missing a study on the tradeoff in terms of compute compared to I-JEPA. In terms of memory, running time and data efficiency.\n\n4) Figure 2 is very unclear. There is not much additional information compared to the similar figure in the I-JEPA paper, and the explanation for \u201cLocal aggregation head\u201d and \u201cMasked Semantic Neighboring\u201d is only in the text. I would recommend clarifying the Figure and emphasizing the difference with I-JEPA.\n\n5) The visualization of Figure 1 is not convincing. I-JEPA patches already contain highly semantic information and Dense-JEPA clearly brings a bias towards neighboring patches, which is not necessarily a good thing as we would like to let the system pick patches that are far away but semantically very similar.\n\n\n\n[1] Dense Contrastive Learning for Self-Supervised Visual Pre-Training, Wang et al, CVPR 2021\n\n[2] VICRegL: Self-Supervised Learning of Local Visual Features, Bardes et al, NeurIPS 2022\n\n[3] Object discovery and representation networks, Henaff et al, ECCV 2022\n\n[4] Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers, Caron et al, ICCV 2021\n\n[5] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision, Oquab et al, 2023"
