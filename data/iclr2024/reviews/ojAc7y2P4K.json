The ambulance scheduling problem is different from the typical vehicle routing problem in that patient arrivals are random and thus the problem is difficult to solve. This article uses a reinforcement learning approach to PPO, taking into account the different number of ambulances available during the day shift and night shift, and taking into account the priority of things. Finally, a synthetic event generator is used. Historical and synthetic data reflecting incidents reported to the EMCC of the OUH are used to test the model and to contrast some underlying ambulance dispatch methods."

In terms of technical contributions, while the MDP formulation is an important contribution (although not entirely new), the novelties seem very limited as it directly uses PPO to solve the problem. \n3. Emergency response systems typically follow hard constraints on response time (e.g., maximize number of patients served within D minutes). I failed to understand how the proposed reward function considers such threshold values. Even in experimental results, only mean response times are shown. Having percentage of requests from different severity levels served within threshold times would have been an ideal metric. \n4. Experimental setup and results are not up to the mark. Simple heuristics based on spatial distance are only considered as benchmarks, while avoiding state-of-the-art methods. A bare minimum requirement would be to consider different versions of deep RL methods to position why PPO is the best choice.\n5.\tThere is a high chance that the simulator is biased towards historical demand distributions. As the spatio-temporal demand patterns typically change over time, some risk analysis is required on whether the assignment policy is overfitted. Moreover, it is not clear how the policy will adapt to dynamic nature of demand patterns."
