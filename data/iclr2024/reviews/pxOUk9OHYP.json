Image compression is an unsupervised task, and the data is very very easy to acquire. Any image dataset can be directly used. And there are aboundant large datasets, such as Openimage (9,000k) and LAION-5b (5,000,000k), that have not been used by image compression at all. Instead of performing data augumentation on a small dataset (the authors use 300k subset of Openimage), directly use a larger dataset seems to be the most straightforward way. Afterall, natural image dataset are already very very large. For example, the authors train the model with 90 epochs on 300k images, which means that any image dataset with 27,000k is enough to provide a different image for each iter. And obvious candidates for this task would include LAION-400M (400,000k), LAION-5B high res (170,000k) and LAION-5B (5,000,000k). \n* Second, the empirical results is too weak to justify that the data augumentation. The best improvement for BD-BR is -0.66\\%, which is too marginal. For example, a -5.0\\% improvement in BD-BR is approximately 0.2 dB improvement in BD-PSNR. And a BD-BR of -0.66\\%, without reporting standard deviation, is too weak to support a paper."

                "value": "## Questions\n* It would be much more convincing if the authors are dealing with special images that are hard to acquire. For example, medical image, remote sensing image. Currently the authors only test their methods on natural image, which is too cheap to acquire and eliminates the need for data augumentation.\n* The current empirical results is too weak, and the authors should provide an improvement of 2\\% to 5\\% improvement of BD-BR to support a paper, this might be achieved by chaning the domain of image.\n* A perhaps more intuitative measure of difficulty is the distance between single image's R-D and average R-D curve. This can be obtained by any pre-trained image codec. It would be interesting to see whether this achieves the same effect as B-RGB-SD."

Authors propose using RGB standard deviation of RGB blocks to get a measure for the difficulty of an image, and show in Fig 2. how this correlates to bpp/PSNR. They report a person correlation. The weakness lies in no baselines given: if we have a codec (eg even just JPEG) we can trivially calculate bpp/PSNR and with two or more images we could fit a line. How does that compare to the proposed method?\n\nPart 2: Table 1 does not show an actionable insight. The proposed B-RBG-SD is apparently not enough to select a subset, because the optimal subset is only known after trainign a model on each. I.e. The authors cannot come up with a prediction of what a useful subset is, so the method is meaningless. In Fig.4, we also don't see a novel insight: training on hard examples improves hard inference, but makes easy images worse, and vice-versa, this is just classical ML: you are good where you train.\n\nPart 3: CutSharp: The augmentation provides very miniuscule gains only (Table 4) and in Fig 5 we see no obvious visual diff (not surprising given the tiny PSNR diffs, e.g., 0.05dB between a) and d).\n\nOverall, this paper does not contain insights or results that warrant an ICLR publication."

More experiments are suggested to support this claim. \n  \n2. If the claim of Q1 is true, the problem of imbalance on B-RGB-SD may come from the crop process during training.

So It is no doubt that the model trained on this subset will lead to a better result on the test set. I think that Figure 4 can only prove that the subset of top 20-40% B-RGB-SD is closer to Kodak than other subsets and the subset of top 60-80% B-RGB-SD is the one closest to CLIC dataset.\n\n- Another major weakness of this paper is lack of motivation. Only the data augmentation method (Cutsharp) is given, but there is no explanation as to why it is designed this way. Why sharpening and why cut?  \n -- Why sharpening? There are so many operations for low-level image processing, why choose sharpening?  What is the specificity of the sharpening operation? Why not try the combination of different operations?  \n -- Why cut? What will happen if the operation (such as sharpening) performed on the entire image?"
