However, a problem of introducing class hierarchy is that when applied to a new dataset, for example, the ADE20k dataset, a new class hierarchy graph should be prepared. Not sure how to make the proposed method universal to different segmentation datasets.\n\n- Fromt the paper, it seems that the proposed method only use two datasets, i.e., Cityscapes and ACDC, to evaluate the proposed method. As these two datasets, as mentioned in the paper, are composed of only 19 classes, two questions consequently come:\n\n  - First, more datasets should be used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.\n  - Second, the Cityscapes dataset only contain 19 classes. I think the authors should do some experiments on some dataset with more classes. A proper one might be the ADE20K dataset, which has more than 100 semantic categories. This would definitely verify the effectiveness of the adaptive hierarchical certification method.\n\n- I also think some segmentation results should be visualized to see in which cases the proposed adaptive hierarchical certification helps."

The key differences are the hierarchical structure for semantic classes and the CIG metic for evaluation.  However, in my view, the proposed methods in section 4 are just a simple modification of SegCertify. There are no essential differences in theory. The new formulas are direct changes because of the different input shapes. As for the CIG, there are no insights why we should use that form. I agree that we need more robust certification methods for segmentation. However, the methods in this work is not a game-changer for this topic. \n\n2.Insufficeint experiments\n\nFirst, there are no comparisions with other segmentation methods. As a typical vision task, should the authors provide reuslts with the mIoU, mAP, etc? I suggest the authors add more comparisions with segmentation methods. Second, from the results in Tab.1, there are no significant differences in the performance (the gaps < 2%). They are too small. It is not convicning. Third, there are no enough examples to clarify the final conclusion. In fact, the authors only present the results with 100 images (If I misunderstand, corret me). Please list the results of the whole datasets. Finally, there are no visual examples for the failure cases. And the figure 1 is not enough.\n\n3.Unclear details\n\nThere are many unclear details. For examples, what is the meaning of IP in Eq.1? What are the type I and type II errors? How do the SAMPLEPOSTERIORS and HSAMPLE operate?  What is the effect of using different hierarchical structure for semantic classes?"
