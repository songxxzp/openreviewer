In Fig. 2, the left panel of Fig. 2(a) is the same as the right panel of Fig. 2(a). In Fig. 2(c) and (d), it seems that the performance of PCA is similar to the proposed IOB. The baseline PCA is too simple; why not compare with more complex baselines, such as Kernel PCA and PCAAE?\n1. Fig. 3 shows that Separate AEs are comparable with the proposed method.
