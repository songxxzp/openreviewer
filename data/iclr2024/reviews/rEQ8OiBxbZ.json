How does the method perform on datasets like QM9?\n\nQ3. For the ablation study, it would also be interesting to see how the proposed 3D TokenGT helps to boost the performance since one of the claim in the paper is that the atom-bond inconsistency problem is tackled by modeling graph as a set of nodes and edges."

Table 2 is missing the vast majority of best performing models from the opengraph benchmark large scale challenge.  Interestingly, the comparison in table 2 misses the top two entries which are models included in Table 1; if I count correctly the LEGO model would rank 9th in the validation metric with a substantial gap compared to unimol published in last year's ICLR.  It would be useful if the authors submitted their model to the benchmark to see the performance on the test set.\n\nThe text has a lot of rushed / unclear sentences.

(In contrast, some of the discussion of the atom-bond inconsistency problem is potentially possible to skip as it doesn't add meaningful insights.) Did the authors think of extending their tetrahedral segmentation approach to use a similar fragment-based approach instead?\n\nCan the authors comment on the disparity of the approach of their validation scores on moleculeNet vs those on the large-scale challenge?  \n\nThe ablation study is not helpful: the perturbation of the model is too limited, and table 3 suggests strongly that the parameters are actually not optimal.  The random perturbation pretraining of table 4 is not described in a clear enough fashion."
