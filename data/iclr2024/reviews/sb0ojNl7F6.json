Or do we need to control 2 joints?\n- Some explanations are not clear: \n   - It says `elbow`, but in the method it says empirically it uses the base joint\n   - i don't understand why choosing any joint in between would make problems for IK solver: it's just removing 1 DoF and the solver should work just fine.

The basic idea for this new action space is to avoid the joint space redundancies that end-effector based control incurs (when N (degress-of-freedom) of a robot > 6). \n\nTo avoid these redundancies the paper extends the robot\u2019s action space to 6 (EE) + (N - 6), where the latter part is controlling the redundant part of the joint space. In many robots (e.g. Franka-Pandas) these redundant dofs arise in the elbow of the robot and probably thus the name. The paper shows that their proposed action space works better in some RLBench tasks (although 4 of the tasks seem to be new tasks) and in some small-scale real-world experiments."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I think the overall approach is highly engineered for particular scenarios and robots and is not general. For instance, in the E3J method (the main method), the paper proposes to constraint the base joint but that is an arbitrary choice. Certain parts of the task may find it beneficial to constraint the wrist joint. Further, there can be tasks, which use configurations where constraining the middle joint is useful. For instance, consider scenario where the franka arm has been rotated such that it lies flat and thus the middle joint acts as an elbow. Clearly the proposed approach is infeasible in these scenarios.\n\n**Relation to existing work:** To some extent the E3J idea can be viewed from the lens of a hierarchical policy (where first a constrained joint is learned and then the EE-action). Similar idea of hierarchical control and learning in hierarchical action spaces especially with respect to null-spaces has been considered in prior work (Sharma et al.). Unfortunately, the paper is not cited (or discussed). \n\nInfact, the idea of hierarchical composition in Sharma etal is more general since it composes arbitrary number controllers in null-spaces. This automatically leads to the E3J approach where first a joint is selected and then the IK is used under the constraint of this joint to reach the desired agent (thus automatically acting in the null-space). One difference, between Sharma et al. and the current work is that the former only considers task-space constraints and use task-space impedance control to control the robot. While the current work uses a joint-constraint and task-constraint/goal and use IK for control. However, there are prior works (as referenced in Sharma eta al), which do controller composition directly in the joint space. \n\nInfact, it may actually be useful to combine this paper with Sharma etal. and consider more general hierarchical policies.  Finally, there is other related works which focus on learning constraints from demonstrations that should also be potentially cited.\n\nSharma et al. *Learning to Compose Hierarchical Object-Centric Controllers for Robotic Manipulation*\n\nLin et al. *Learning Null Space Projections*\n\nHoward et al. *A novel method for learning policies from variable constraint data*\n\n**Generality of the approach:** Can you talk about the challenges in using this approach on very differently settings. For instance, consider the UR arms and if the task only requires one degree of freedom for successful execution. The presented approach wouldn\u2019t consider this scenario but wouldn\u2019t the benefits of a constrained action space for learning be useful even in this setting? \n\nIt would also be useful to show images/videos of simulation tasks which are being considered as full-body tasks.\n\n**Use of IK:** As is briefly noted in the paper, can the authors clarify if they indeed used constrained IK (with the joint constraint) to solve for the end-effector target pose? Were there any issues or challenges related with solving this optimization problem. For instance, what if the IK failed because the joint constraint makes it hard for the robot to reach the desired EE pose. I would imagine such scenarios to arise, but the paper is very light on such implementation details. \n\nAnother issue with an IK based approach is that it can be expensive to solve at every RL step especially when we perform delta end-effector actions. In such settings most works use the jacobian based controller (osc), how would the proposed approach work with such a choice?"
