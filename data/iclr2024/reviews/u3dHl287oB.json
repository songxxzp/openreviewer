I think it might be motivated by the case of permuted MNIST where permutations do not change the label. It would be great if the authors could comment on that in their revision.\n- Certainly there is some gap between the theory and MNIST experiments. The authors are encouraged to discuss that gap. For example, the training loss in the theory vs test error in the experiments. The least-squares loss in the theory vs classification loss in the experiments (I suppose).\n- Is there any deeper connection between the bound in the highly overparameterized regime, $\\alpha^2(1-\\alpha)^2$, and the corresponding bound in Lemma 9 of Evron et al. (2022) for the case $k=2$?\n- While the main theorem is accomplished by algebraic calculations, I wonder whether there is a geometric proof that would achieve the same. For example, the two steps can be thought of as two projections (onto certain subspaces), and the forgetting can be bounded deterministically by some quantity related to the principal angles. With a random orthogonal transformation, the principal angles between the two subspaces would be in some sense random. Would it be easier if one analyzes the randomness of the principal angles, and could the algebraic proofs be replaced by geometric reasoning?"

I am fine with simple experiments in a theoretical paper but the upper bound of forgetting is very specific to the linear regression task. \n\n**Overparametrization proxy:** The second issue is tightly related to the above, in theorem 3,  the proxy for overparametrization is defined as $1 - \\frac{d}{p}$, where $d$ is the rank of the input data and $p$ is the data dimensionality. It makes sense in linear regression since the number of parameters is the same as the data dimension, i.e., $p$. This is true to some extent in the MLP layers (at least they are correlated). However, none of the derivations hold in the case of the convolutional layers where there are shared parameters and $p$ cannot be a surrogate for the number of parameters. I encourage the authors to evaluate their upper bound in CNNs. \n\n**Task similarity definition:** Also, the definition of task similarity is very limited to the rotation of a subset of the data dimensions. All of the derivations are based on this initial assumption. I believe a good theoretical paper on this subject should expand this definition so that more real-world cases can be included in the analysis. My comment is the same for the permuted-NIST scenario. A simple permutation of a subset of pixels is not enough to back the main message in this more challenging scenario."

                "value": "The authors present an analytical upper bound for the expected amount of catastrophic forgetting during linear regression with gradient descent as a function of overparameterisation and overlap between tasks. In particular, they show that there exist two phenomenologically different learning regimes: In the overparameterised regime (i.e. $rank({\\bf X}) / rank({\\bf w})$ small) intermediate similarity between tasks leads to largest amount of forgetting (inverted U-shape) and monotonic behaviour is observed near the interpolation threshold ($rank({\\bf X}) / rank({\\bf w}) \\approx 1$). To this end, the authors make the following assumptions: (1) The target values for both tasks $({\\bf y})$ are identical, (2) both tasks are realisable (i.e. a zero-loss solution exists) (3) the second task is an orthogonal projection of the first task (c.f. permutation) and (4) the first task has successfully converged to the global, minimum-norm solution of task one before training on task two. By changing the subspace which the orthogonal operator transforms, the overlap between the tasks can be exactly controlled and its effect analytically studied.\n\n\n**--------------------------------------**\n\n**Unfortunately, I can not add official comments (anymore), thus I will add my comments to the author's comments here**\n\n**Reply 1**\nWeaknesses 1&2 and Questions 1,2,3: Thank you for the clarifications. As it is not obvious from section 2.1 why equation (3) is the closest point on the solution manifold when starting to train from the convergence point of task 1, I would like to suggest to include this derivation in the appendix.\n\nWeakness 3: Thank you for the clarification.\n\nWeakness 6: As there is no direct mapping from permuting MNIST to DOTS, I have mild concerns that the observed phenomena could be explained away by the fact that most information is in the center of the image and thus increasing the permuted area from the center to the outside may result in a non-linear transformation of the dimensional of the data-manifold. If the effect is non-linear, comparisons to phenomena observed when manipulating DOTS would be erroneous. However, I appreciate that the authors try to test their hypotheses on more complex data.\n\nWeakness 4: The minimum-norm solutions studied by the authors are part of the \"rich\" learning regime. The lazy regime does exist in (multi-layer) linear networks. For example, in the regression model, weight values that lay in the null-space of the training data of the first task could be unequal zero. For example, when initialising the weight matrix from large random values, GD would still converge to a gloabl optimum, however, the convergence points would be unequal to equation (2) and (3). Thus, I would argue that the presented analytical results only apply to the rich learning regime.\n\nFurther, in an over-parametrized linear two-layer network, the first layer can be initialised, large and arbitrarily (and in theory even kept fixed). GD would still converge to a global optimum, however, as a consequence, the learned representations in the hidden layer would be \"lazy\". Again, I don't think that the analytical result apply to this regime and thus simulations that compare these two regimes (i.e. training from (very) small initial weights and training from large initial weights) would be useful. \n\nSee also question: For Figures 6 & 7, how are the neural networks initialized? Do they operate in the rich or lazy regime?\n\n\n**Reply 2**\nI would like to thank the authors for addressing my questions.\n\nWeakness 5: Thank you for adding these additional simulations.\n\nQuestion: Can you give an intuitive explanation for why the expected forgetting is non-asymptotic for overparameterized regime and near interpolation threshold\n\nSorry, that question was not very well formulated. What I tried to ask is: Do you have an intuitive explanation for why in the overparametrized regime, the expected forgetting for increasing task dissimilarity if falling off, whereas near the interpolation threshold, it keeps increasing?\n\n**The following points remain unaddressed:**\n\n- **Weakness 7: Simulation details and / or code are not provided which makes interpretation of simulation results difficult and reproduction impossible.**\n- **Weakness 10: The introduction to continual learning / catastrophic forgetting is, in my opinion, not referenced well enough**\n\n\nAs a result of the changes made by the authors I have increased my rating to a 6.\n\n**--------------------------------------**"

                "value": "1. The model (i.e. single linear projection) and algorithm (gradient descent, full-batch gradient descent?!) are not stated in the introduction. Information about the regime to which the analytical result applies is scattered throughout the paper, which makes it difficult to contextualise the results.\n2. It would be really helpful if all assumptions of the analytical result would be stated explicitly and collected within one section of the paper. For example, the ${\\bf 0}$ initialisation and resulting convergence to the global, minimum-norm solution of the first task is hidden in Scheme 1 but crucial to understand the extent of the analytical result.\n3. I think the paper could benefit from making it more explicit that the analysis focuses on the dimensionality and overlap with respect to the manifold of the data distribution, which is often called overparametereised, but should not be confused with the overparameterisation deep networks (i.e. wide hidden layers).\n(4. Resulting from 3., the model can not be used to make predictions about the underparameterised regime, e.g. bottlenecked networks.)\n5. I think the paper should state explicitly that the analysis is limited to the rich learning regime. It does not provide any insights into the lazy learning regime. Comparisons and references from the paper\u2019s \u201coverparameterised regime\u201d to e.g. the NTK regime are confusing and incorrect.\n6. Simulation results in Figure 2. are limited to $d = 2$. There are no simulation results to validate the analytical result for edge-cases like p = d and large(r) d etc.\n7. I am not entirely sure if the author\u2019s version of permuted MNIST is suitable to study changes in task similarity that are comparable to DOTS, as vanilla MNIST data is on a very low dimensional data manifold and large parts of the information is centred on the middle of the picture. I think I would prefer a simulation study that uses artificial data as in Figure 4., with well controlled DOTS in two layer networks.\n8. Simulation details (initialisation scheme, learning rates etc.) and / or code are not provided.\n\nMinor:\n9. The notation in equations (2) and (3) is confusing. There are too many equal signs\n10. The introduction to continual learning / catastrophic forgetting is, in my opinion, not referenced well enough\n11. Using X_1 and X interchangeably is confusing and seems unnecessary"

Why is that the case and how is it relevant to the analysis?\n- Is there a benefit of using an informal illustration instead of slices from figure 3 in figure 1? The inverted U-shape seems to be slightly exaggerated as expected forgetting for large DOTS don\u2019t fall off nearly as strongly as suggested by the illustration.\n- Can you give an intuitive explanation of why the expected forgetting are (non-)asymptotic for overparameterised regime and near the interpolation threshold?\n- Do the authors think that their results do generalise to learning more than two tasks? I think that would clearly contradict some of the assumptions and thus maybe should be listed as a limitation of the work?\n- Is it maybe possible to use a log-scaled axis in Figure 3 instead of using subplots to represent the results?\n- Is it possible that the x-axis of Figure 3, bottom right is labelled incorrectly? Values from 0 to 0.1 seem to be missing\n- For figures 6. and 7., how are neural networks initialised? Do they operate in the rich or lazy regime?"
