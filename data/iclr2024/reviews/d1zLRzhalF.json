As an RL-based method, RGMG only modifies the input embedding modules while keeping the RL module unchanged compared to existing works.\n\nThe selected baselines for comparison are outdated, despite being RL-based.

However, such an extension is mainly achieved by incorporating the relation embedding into the message-passing functions.\n\n2. The scope of this method is limited.\n- Reinforcement learning-based method is out-of-date. The nearest baseline is CURL, which was published in AAAI 2022. The other two methods are MINERVA in ICLR 2017 and M-walk in NeurIPS 2018. The are little related works published in the top conferences (ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS) in recent years.\n- The current trend in KG reasoning changes to path-based or GNN-based methods, like NBFNet and A*Net, both of which perform much better than the results in Table 2. In addition, these methods can do inductive reasoning and also generate interpretable paths.\n\n3. The compared methods are not enough. There have been a lot of KG reasoning methods over the last decade, but only five methods (DistMult in 2015, ComplEx in 2017, MINERVA in 2017, M-Walk in 2018, and Curl in 2022) are compared.\n\n4. Many typos:\n- The first paragraph in section 3.3, z'rt-1 and x'vt-1?\n- Section 3.4, what is line 5? should be Equation 5?\n- The values of 3034, 543, 17535 are validation tuples for the three datasets? not clearly written.\n- The caption of Figure 3 is identical to Figure 2.\nThese typos are very obvious and made a very bad impression for me.
