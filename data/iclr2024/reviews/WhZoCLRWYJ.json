Following the connections of the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge problem to entropic optimal transport, the authors want to learn the true entropic OT plan. They parametrize the optimal entropic OT plan as the product of two probabilities, the source measure $p_0$ and a conditional plan $\\pi(x_1|x_0)$ (up to a normalization constant). Following this novel parametrization, they show that they can optimize the parametrized plan without the knowledge of the true entropic OT plan. To deal with the normalization constant, they use a mixture of Gaussian representations to get a tractable form of each of the components. They then explain the inference and training procedure. Finally, they perform several experiments to show the practicability of the proposed method (2D synthetic data, an EOT benchmark, single-cell dynamics and unpaired image-to-image experiment)."

As the evaluation is performed on a leave-one-domain out and training on the others, it is questionable that the training procedure was the same. I believe that some of these competitors should be reproduced by the authors to ensure that the training setting is similar, especially as the unpaired image-to-image experiment is a quantitative experiment without competitors.\n\n2. The experiments were performed in a relatively small dimensional setting: the unpaired image-to-image experiments used a pre-trained feature extractor of dimension 512, the single-cell data experiment used the representation of the 5 whitened principal components (ie dimension of 5), and the EOT benchmark data were (at most) of dimension 128. Therefore, the question of the performance of the proposed method in high-dimensional data is legitimate, especially as the authors use a mixture of Gaussian representation.\n\n3. Little is said about the statistical estimation (with respect to the data dimension and sample size) of the proposed parametrization to the true entropic OT plan $\\pi^\\star$. It is known that it also suffers from the curse of dimension [2,3].\n\n4.

                "value": "1. How does your method depend on the dimensionality of the data? I think that this is a legitimate question, especially with the normalization constant being approximated by a mixture of Gaussians. I recommend adding more dimensionality in some experiments (like single-cell by considering a larger number of principal components. Maybe 5, 50, 200, 500, 1000?) to study how the proposed method performs as the dimension grows. I also recommend adding this discussion to the limitation paragraph in Appendix E. \n\n2. On the single-cell experiment of the unpaired image-to-image experiment, could you show the training speed to reach convergence and the number of iterations it took? I checked the appendix and I did not find such plots. Maybe it would be interesting to compare to other OT solvers (sinkhorn or stochastic variants) on a simple problem to see the different behaviour. (I acknowledge that the Sinkhorn solvers are only usable in a discrete setting.) \n\n3. I found the limitation discussion in Appendix E interesting and it could have been in the main paper. I recommend moving it to the main paper. Maybe some discussions about related work could go in the appendix instead. \n \nI am ready to reconsider my score if the authors can reproduce some of the competitor results and consider the highest dimensional setting of single-cell data experiments (dimension of +1000). It will depend on how well the proposed algorithm will behave on medium dimensionality.\n\n\n----- EDIT POST REBUTTAL -----\n\nThank you for your answer. I have read the rebuttal.\n\n[Single-cell experiments] Thank you for the novel experiments on the single-cell trajectory problem. I find them interesting and encouraging, especially with the different dimensions. \n\nI understand the motivation for using a different metric than W_1 to compare the different approaches. However as it is not the standard metric, it is hard for me to compare your method with other standard single-cell trajectory methods. As the authors-reviewer discussion has ended (due to a late rebuttal submission), I would have appreciated seeing the Wasserstein 1 metric for the different approaches. Indeed, the novel dataset was first considered by [Tong et al., 2023] where they used the W_1 distance. As the authors did not reproduce their method with the considered metric, it is hard to compare with more standard approaches on single-cell datasets like ODE/SDE-based approaches [Tong et al., 2023]. Unfortunately, two of the considered competitive methods are not standard in the single-cell trajectory literature. Therefore, I still think that the experimental section lacks reproduced competitors especially as the metrics are different.\n\n[Novel theoretical section] Thank you for the novel appendix H. It brings some light to the proposed methodology. I suggest the authors include Theorem H.1 in the main paper.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a borderline paper. I acknowledge that the proposed approach is new and interesting but I still think that it lacks a more rigorous experimental section to understand its practical performance with the current literature. Therefore, I will keep my score."

The authors of this work propose a solution to this problem by consider a settings where the continuous SB is associated with a Wiener prior (as a reference measure). The key idea is to consider the parameterization of the Schrodinger potential as a mixture of Gaussian, and rewrite the SB optimization objective following this, with easy to compute mean and (scalar diagonal) covariance matrix. The authors provide some theoretical analysis of their algorithm, along with empirical demonstrations on synthetic dataset and realistic dataset (single cell data population dynamic and image-to-image translation)."

Admittedly, the authors have clearly elaborated in their paper of such cases, but I do not see the clear novelty in the methodology part. Even on the proof of the universal theorem of the Gaussian mixture model, one can see that half of it is straightforward calculation from the two aforementioned paper.  \n* **Unclear benefit the of LightSB solver in realistic setting:** for the single cell dataset using W1 distance as a metric, LightSB's performance leaves some gaps with the two best methods, however I do not see author's comment about this. The other benchmark on unpaired image-to-image translation is very hard to judge, as for this task there is no quantitative metric to compare with other solvers. I do not know why the authors omit unconditional image generation tasks, as this is an important and popular benchmark that has FID as a standard metric. Morevoer, there have already exist results on some of the neural EOT solvers or the diffusion SB solver (using iterative proportional fitting)/diffusion SB matching (using iterative Markovian fitting), or flow matching/rectified flow in this task, so it is easy to compared with the baseline. \n*  **Questionable theoretical result:** in the proof the universality of the Gaussian mixture parameterization for SB (theorem 3.4), in the paragraph below equation (29), I fail to understand why the authors wrote \n\n> \"Besides, it also has scalar covariances of its components because multiplier $exp(\u2212 |x_1|^2 /2\\epsilon )$\u2019s covariance is scalar itself\" \n\n, but what I understood in the paper's settings is that $x_1 \\sim \\pi_1$ is an unknown distribution, without assumptions on its parametric form.

                "value": "Summary\n1) The authors propose a novel light solver for continuous SB with the Wiener prior, i.e., EOT with the quadratic transport cost. The solver has a straightforward non-minimax learning objective and uses the Gaussian mixture parameterization for the EOT/SB, which avoids the time-consuming max-min optimization, simulation of the full process trajectories, iterative learning, and MCMC techniques that are in use in existing continuous solvers.\n2) The authors show that their novel light solver provably satisfies the universal approximation property for EOT/SB between the distributions supported on compact sets.\n3) The authors demonstrate the performance of the light solver in a series of synthetic and real-data experiments, including the ones with the real biological data considered in related works."

But to be honest, I'm not familiar with the proof so I'm not sure of the technical depth.\n- A minor thing but I really appreciate the authors giving a very clear description of the limitations of the solver.\n\nFollowing the rebuttal, the authors also provided statistical guarantees for the method."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Weaknesses:\nThis work does not have a finite-time nor finite-sample convergence guarantee. I believe that with additional assumptions one can obtain convergence guarantees as in [1]. Furthermore, there have been multiple works on the sampling complexity of quadratic cost EOT, and given the equivalence between EOT and SB, I believe that obtaining guarantees should be feasible.\n\nI also think that the experiments are not comprehensive enough. While the results are nice, I'm wondering what is the runtime performance of the light solver against other solvers. I cannot vouch for the method if I don't know how the method would improve in terms of the quality of the result and the computational cost.\n\nThe authors did mention that the work relies on Gaussian mixture parameterization and the entropic cost. It is indeed a limitation but personally, I think it is fine. Nevertheless, I will still raise this as a potential weakness.\n\nAll and all, I like the paper but it does not convince me enough to vouch for its acceptance yet.\n\nMinor comments:\nI think the literature on EOT is not sufficient. The authors should include gradient-based EOT solvers such as [2] (both of these methods achieved the optimal O(n^2/eps) complexity, which is stronger than that of APDAGD and seems to have good performance) and a gradient-based entropic UOT solver [3].\n\nReferences:\n[1] Chen, Y., Deng, W., Fang, S., Li, F., Yang, N.
