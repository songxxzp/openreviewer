What are the assumptions in previous works? How large is the coreset in previous works? How many are the queries of previous works? I can't find explicit comparisons. It would be better to add a table to list them. \n    \n   Empirically, there is only one compared method [1], which is published in 2018. It seems there are several methods for coreset after 2018, as listed in the related work. But there is no comparison with them.\n3. It seems there are some errors in the proof and algorithm. \n    \n   a. By using Holder continuity of $l$, you obtain that $l(e)\\leq \\hat{l}(e)+\\lambda v(e)$, where $v(e)$ is defined as $||e-A(e)||^z$. It seems $e$ and $A(e)$ belong to the sample space. But the Holder continuity needs that $e$ and $A(e)$ belong to the embedding space. To satisfy the Holder continuity, $v(e)$ should be $||v_e-v_{A(e)}||^z$, where $v_x$ stands for the embedding of $x$. There should be some modifications in proof and algorithm.\n    \n   b. It seems that the expectation of $X_i$ (defined in Appendix B.2) is $\\sum l(e)w(e)p(e)=\\sum l(e)/s$. Therefore, by using Bernstein\u2019s inequality, $|\\sum l(e)/s-\\sum w(e)l(e)|$ is bounded, rather than $|\\sum l(e)-\\sum w(e)l(e)|$.\n4. There is an extra time cost to obtain the embedding for each sample, which may take about the same amount of time as inference.  Although query efficient, the total time cost may be similar with previous works.\n\n\n[1] Ozan Sener and Silvio Savarese. Active learning for convolutional neural networks: A core-set approach."

For example, Algorithms 1 and 2 are never referred. The definition of $\\mathcal{A}$ from the first lines of both algorithms is not properly stated and it is also overloaded $\\mathcal{A}(e)$. Is it defined as $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{D}) := \\min_{|C| = k} C' \\cdot \\Phi_z(\\mathcal{D},C)$ for some constant $C'$? In the clustering objective $C$ is not defined correctly where $|C| = k$ and $C \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$. There is also inconsistency in using norms, somewhere $||\\cdot||$ or $||\\cdot||_2$ is used. $\\Delta$ is mentioned in section 3.1 without definition. Overall I recommend a better use of space for defining variables as opposed to other sections like stating Berstein's inequality. \n\n Given these questions, their overall contribution appears reasonable in terms of the empirical study of their proposed algorithm, but the theoretical contribution is lacking."

The paper title has sensitivity; however, the paper does not really use sensitivity as defined in literature. It appears to use a very crude approximation to sensitivity which is why there is an additive error. This idea also is very similar to the one of \"light weight coresets\".\n3. The additive error can be pretty large I believe. \n4. The proofs are pretty straight forward (not a bad thing in itself); however, it means even proof technique wise there is not much contribution. For e.g., the proof of theorem 6 is direct application of Bernstein and is well known. The proof for the 1-round algorithm is also very similar to existing proofs.\n4. For regression, theoretical guarantees are much weaker than ones obtained using leverage scores. Empirically the authors claim they can match leverage score sampling in much less time. However, I could not find if they report the time for regression experiments.\n5. There are small writing errors as well. For e.g.: what is $X$ in theorem 1,7? In Algorithm 2 $x_0$ is mentioned in step 2 and computed in step 3.\nOverall, I think the authors need to clarify and highlight the contributions of the paper more and contrast them with existing results, especially in terms of novelty."
