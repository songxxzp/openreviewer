Model refusing to response is the most important criterion. When the crowdworkers are shown distractor samples (query and response are mismatched), factuality and contradiction (within the output) are both rated worse which implies that annotators fail to disentangle these criteria from the overall quality of a response.\n\nNext, the authors investigate how assertiveness and complexity of LM response affect human judgements. They found that annotators are more trusting of assertive responses, and are less likely to identify factuality or inconsistency errors within them. Furthermore, more complex or more assertive responses are incorrectly perceived as being less repetitive.\n\nBoth of these findings are cast a shadow of doubt on whether reward derived from human feedback is the right optimization target for aligning LMs or the right criterion for evaluating them."

The paper is well-written and easy to follow. \n3. The analyses in the paper are carefully designed and comprehensive.

                "value": "1. One big question not addressed in the paper is how the biases in human judgement scale with human capabilities (e.g. question difficulty, annotator competence) and model capabilities (e.g. model size). Are humans more biased when evaluating responses they\u2019re less competent to evaluate (e.g. medical advice, science explanations)? Are larger models more susceptible to exploit human biases? Overall, I think a good perspective for grounding this paper is scalable oversight [1]: the problem of evaluating agents more capable than the evaluators. LM capabilities will soon surpass human capabilities on many tasks and it\u2019s critical to know whether human feedback will be increasingly misleading. That\u2019s of course a big open problem and I don\u2019t take not addressing it against the paper, it but it would be relatively easy to do experiments with models of the same family but different size or group questions by (perceived) difficulty.\n2. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m convinced that \u201cHuman evaluation is necessary\u201d (as stated in the conclusion). Techniques such as RL from AI feedback have been shown to be as effective as RLHF for increasing the harmlessness of LMs [2]. They ultimately rely on humans, but these are human experts involved in prompt engineering and designing rules and constitutions used for generating training data for SFT and training preference models. A big open questions is whether LMs-as-evaluators inherit human biases, even when carefully prompted. A simple experiment addressing this question would involve having an LM play the role of an evaluator and conducting a similar analysis for its judgements.\n3. The crowdworkes were asked to rate LM responses according to each criterion in series and then to give an overall score. I wonder such ordering of the task is not itself a confounder. Would overall scores be different if the crowsworkers were not asked to give scores for criteria before? Would a score for `Formatting` be different if the crowdworkers were not ask for `Factuality` before? Do authors control for this anyhow?\n4. It\u2019s subtly incorrect to say that \u201cPerez et al. (2023) identified similar \u2018inverse-scaling\u2019 behaviour, where training on a RLHF objective worsens sycophancy\u201d. I think the paper showed that base LMs are already pretty sycophantic and that RLHF does not fix that. I think from that paper alone it\u2019s still unclear that RLHF increases sycophancy; there is no robust trend. However, Sharma et al. [3] have recently provided much stronger evidence for the role of human feedback and RLHF objective in the emergence of sycophancy.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03540 \n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073\n\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13548"

They find that refusal, formatting, relevance, repetition, and factuality, and inconsistency lead to reductions in overall score, while contradictions, scope, fluency, and harmfulness do not. In a second experiment, the annotators find that low assertiveness tends to lower annotator scores, and raising assertiveness tends to improve scores across subcategories (e.g., factuality, relevance).

There were hints at one possible perspective of a solution -- optimizing nebulous \"preference\" is far from what people do when using language, which is more based on utility and communicative success (which preference is not tied to at all).\n* I think the analysis in Section 4 is conflating a few different factors in comparing models -- the fact that Command is trained off-policy and Llama 2 is on-policy isn't discussed in enough depth for me to be convinced this is relevant to mention. I don't have a good intuition on why that might influence the model behavior, especially if the two models are trained on different data as well.\n* Following the above, I would have liked to see an experiment that directly shows how optimizing for human preference influences outputs across different dimensions explored in this paper (e.g, assertivness). The evidence from this paper is post-hoc analysis of existing models (in Section 4), and the earlier experiments showing annotators generally conflate quality with features like assertiveness/complexity. There are a couple of things this analysis conflates itself, e.g., the actual data that Command and Llama 2 are trained on, and their learning algorithms. But an even stronger experiment would perform RLHF-based finetuning (or some kind of finetuning with human preference judgments) on data where we have judgments of or could control complexity and assertiveness, and measure how the final models perform on factuality judgments after this process. E.g., perhaps this would show that optimizing for assertiveness++ responses hurts factuality. Or maybe it would show that with the exact same data, fine-tuning using a reward model exacerbates this problem more than just fine-tuning directly. But with the current analysis presented, it's hard to make any concrete conclusion beyond that all these models result in judgments conflating quality with style.\n* I would also like to see an experiment controlling for factuality, like in Section 3.2. E.g., if it's possible to even post-hoc separate the results in Figs 3 and 4 by whether an expert judged the output as factual or not. Basically, do you find that assertive false responses are rated as factual by annotators more often than inassertive true responses?\n* I think the main table showing expert judgments for Sec 3.2 is in the appendix, but in my opinion it should be in the main paper. \n\nIn general, I think the direction this paper investigates is super important, and it indeed highlights a number of issues with current methods. But I also think it could be made a lot stronger, especially in directly showing how these annotation artifacts influence model behavior."

It further suggests that human preferences do not correlate well to the important dimension of factuality of the LLM generated information.  \n\nIn particular, the paper tries to define a broad set of discrete dimensions of various properties/attributes of fine-grained evaluation criteria for LLM model for human judgment - this is trying to map the one preference score to the underlying error categories that the one score should ideally represent (somewhat equally in principle) - however these categories are meant to be defined to capture the epistemological meaning of the human preference and map that to a simple oenology of the error types described in the paper. \n\nThe paper then uses 3 datasets and collects the human preference annotations (with quality control and best practices) )on the various recent model outputs and the ontological error types. The  paper uses a Lasso regression model to fit the preference score to error categories for studying how various error categories contribute to the overall mapping to the single human preference. Some error types have a stronger contribution to the mapping function (eg. Refusal to answer which is very objective dimension unlike others) which some other do not contribute (eg. Harmfulness). Some other important dimensions like factuality and inconsistency have less weights compared to the others. \n\nThe paper then tries to study the \u2018halo effect\u2019 cognitive bias of the LLM generated output and how humans perceive and prefer more assertive generation and more complex generation over less assertiveness and less complexity. The paper notes that increased assertiveness and complexity both lead to slightly higher perceived quality, while low assertiveness\nleads to the worst rated responses. respond. Authors also note that non-expert annotators tend to underestimate the rate of inconsistency or factuality errors, and they are less likely to spot these errors in outputs that are assertive. The authors suggest how controlling the prompts for assertiveness (eg. having low assertiveness) could perhaps be used to promote safer refusals.\n\nSince perceived preference is correlated with assertiveness, the relationship suggests that using human feedback as a training objective could inadvertently increase the complexity and assertiveness of outputs (as a side-effect) and thus introduce these biases in the trained models."

                "value": "- RLHF and human preference alignment topic for LLM human-AI alignment is one of the highly discussed topics today for chatbot training. RLHF is used to teach the models to generate safer outputs (for example, refuse to respond when inappropriate, promote politeness and reduce toxicity and biases). The studies in the paper suggest that the human preferences can easily get confounded with assertive and complex text and prefer those therefore introduce this 'assertiveness bias' and 'complexity bias' in the modeling process. \n\n- The paper also discusses important findings around factuality (and the important topic of hallucinations studies in LLMs). \"Crowdworkers underestimate the rate of factuality and inconsistency errors. This difference is increased for high assertiveness responses, and decreased\nfor low assertiveness responses. In other words, annotators are more trusting of assertive responses, and are less likely to identify factuality or inconsistency errors within them\" -> in other works it could be possible that RLHF methods may promote hallucinations, and introduce more assertiveness and complexity in the generated output."

Since the paper provides insights into understanding these human preferences, more focus on various types of human preferences would have strengthened the finding of the paper\n- Authors very briefly touch upon the AI safety implications but do not give justice to this very important piece of information in the paper - what are the AI safety implications as a result of using human preferences for training and evaluation."
