                "value": "* The paper's novelty is somewhat limited, as it combines SAM with FedRep (Liang et al.), which is a straightforward combination. Notably, prior works like (Qu et al., 2022) and (Caldarola et al., 2022) have already demonstrated the successful combination of SAM and federated learning, while (Zhu et al., 2022) has shown SAM's effectiveness in defending against backdoor attacks.\n\n* The experiments lack comprehensiveness, relying solely on two small-scale datasets for evaluation. It is recommended that the authors consider employing a deeper network, such as ResNet18, in the Cifar10 experiments to enable more meaningful accuracy comparisons.\n\n* The experimental results in Tables 1 and 2 reveal that pFedSam only marginally improves ASR compared to FedRep (7.15% to 5.76% in CIFAR10). However, it's worth considering that the significant ASR reduction compared to other personalized solutions, such as Ditto and FedAvg with additional defenses (up to 31% in CIFAR10), may not be attributed to SAM but rather to FedRep. The rationale behind FedRep's effectiveness in defending against backdoor attacks is straightforward: it discards the classifier of the poisoned shared models and trains them individually with benign clients. However, it's essential to investigate whether SAM training over the feature extractor also keeps the representations free from poisoning. This can be easily demonstrated by generating a t-SNE visualization of the representation distribution.\n\n*  Both FedRep and pFedSAM exhibit vulnerability to backdoor attacks in the BapFL attack, necessitating the addition of existing defenses like Krum and NC to restore satisfactory performance. This highlights that integrating SAM alone may not suffice to resist backdoor poisoning, with the majority of ASR reduction likely attributable to other defenses, diminishing pFedSam's value.\n\n* The motivation behind using SAM in personalized federated learning backdoor defense appears somewhat weak and could benefit from further elaboration.\n\n* A critical point to note is the absence of theoretical guarantees regarding the robustness against backdoor attacks.\n\n\n\nQu Z, Li X, Duan R, et al.

The partial model personalization lets each client own its locally preserved linear classifier to block the propagation of backdoor features from malicious clients to benign clients. The sharpness-aware training generates local flat model updates with better stability and perturbation resilience, resulting in a globally flat model that is robust to the injection of backdoor features from malicious clients. Extensive experiments show the superiority of pFedSAM over state-of-the-art robust baselines in terms of both robustness and accuracy."

Specifically, the paper does not discuss existing works using SAM as a defense to backdoor attacks in centralized settings, while other works addressing backdoor attacks in centralized scenarios are only briefly introduced. Examples are [1,2]. How does the literature for centralized settings differ from the FL one? Also, the concept of global sharpness is not discussed, and we know global sharpness helps improve global consistency [3], which could be linked with resilience to backdoor attacks. Additionally, the use of SAM in FL is not discussed. Examples are [3,4,5,6,7,8]. \n- It is not clear why SAM should be the answer for addressing backdoor attacks, as no intuition or analysis is provided. How do flat minima help in such a case? Why is the model obtained with SAM more robust to backdoor attacks? For instance, [2] shows how backdoor models tend to reach sharper minima (Fig. 1). A similar analysis would be useful to contextualize the paper\u2019s claims. \n- I believe the contribution is limited. Specifically, other works already showed the efficacy of SAM for backdoor attacks (e.g., [1][2]) outside the federated scenario, while SAM has already been studied in federated settings, where its efficacy in multiple tasks has been proved (e.g., generalization, differential privacy ecc). Additionally, partial model sharing for handling backdoor attacks is already a well-known technique, as also discussed in the manuscript. \n- I believe the experimental setting is not general enough. Specifically, very small models (small CNN and a MLP) are deployed on datasets with easy classification tasks (CIFAR10 and MNIST). How does pFedSAM behave when faced with more complex tasks (e.g., CIFAR100)? And how is the backdoor attack effective when using larger (and more realistic) models (e.g., ResNet)? Additionally, the results are evaluated only under one type of heterogeneity with Dirichlet\u2019s parameter $\\beta=0.4$, which does not create a very challenging setting when using such datasets. How does pFedSAM behave under more pronounced heterogeneity, i.e. smaller $\\beta$? Lastly, the attacks are not studied under different numbers of attackers or frequency.\n- Limitations are not addressed.\n\n**Typos and minor comments**:\n- Eq 1: I think $F_i(w_i)$ should be $F_i(w)$ as we are minimizing over $w$. \n- The L2 norm is missing in the definition of the SAM gradient (between Eq. 5 and 6 in the text).\n- Please consider fixing the use of \\cite, \\citet and \\citep, as the citations often appear in the wrong format, making it hard to read the manuscript. I would suggest changing the color as well. \n\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Zhu, Mingli, et al. \"Enhancing Fine-Tuning Based Backdoor Defense with Sharpness-Aware Minimization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.11823 (2023).\n[2] Karim, Nazmul, et al. \"Efficient Backdoor Removal Through Natural Gradient Fine-tuning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.17441 (2023).\n[3] Sun, Yan, et al. \"Dynamic Regularized Sharpness Aware Minimization in Federated Learning: Approaching Global Consistency and Smooth Landscape.\" ICML (2023).\n[4] Qu, Zhe, et al. \"Generalized federated learning via sharpness aware minimization.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
