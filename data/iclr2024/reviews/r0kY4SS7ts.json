The paper seeks to contribute in the space of reward potential Markov game which only admits potential function for each stage game (which does not mean that it will be MPG as already been shown in the literature). The paper then seeks to find the complexity of computing $\\epsilon$ Nash equilibrium. The paper shows that it is PPAD complete. However, the proof is very straightforward from the PPAD-hardness of the $\\epsilon$-equilibrium. Given the nature of the paper, it is important to understand the technical novelty.\n\n2. The paper then considers some assumptions such as additive transition probability and then shows that one can find $\\epsilon$-equilibrium in O(H^5|S|/\\epsilon^2) sample complexity. However, the reviewer is not convinced about the practicality of the algorithm 1. For example, one needs an NE oracle to show the sample complexity. How easily one can find that? Can the algorithm be implemented in a distributed set up.\n\n3. The paper considers that the MDP setup is known which might not be possible in practice."

Once such structures ensure stage games are potential games, computation of the non-stationary equilibrium through backward induction is also very straightforward.\n- Proof for Theorem D.1 is missing."

In a stochastic game, when the number of states is 1 and the length of the time horizon is 1, the problem reduces to an n-player matrix game, which is PPAD-hard. Since RPMGs are a subclass of stochastic games, wouldn't this already verify the hardness of RPMGs? In contrast, I am not sure if it is trivial to extend the existing PPAD-complete results (E.g. Deng 2023) to include nonstationary policies. \n\nOn a side note, the paper is very definition-heavy, and the main results are not presented until page 7.

How did Theorem 3 remove the dependency on the size of the action space?\n2.

                "value": "This paper is about the complexity of computing a Nash equilibrium in reward-potential Markov games, which are games in which the local reward function in every state obeys a potential function. The authors show that computing Nash equilibrium in this family of games is PPAD-hard, and that it can  be done in polynomial time under a certain assumption (additive transitions)."

                "value": "The main gripe concern I have with this paper is that the new setting---additive transitions---seems like almost a trivial generalization of the switching-control setting. Indeed, additive transitions amount to nothing but switching control, but the player in control is chosen at random from the known distribution $\\omega_{\\cdot, s, h} \\in \\Delta(n)$. As such I am not sure how significant the main positive result (Thm 3.3) is. For example, was Thm 3.3 previously known for switching-control games? If so, the authors should clarify exactly what (if anything) makes Thm 3.3 not just a trivial generalization of that prior result; if not, the authors should emphasize that their result is also new in the switching-control setting, which would in my opinion strengthen the paper. \n\nIn general, the preliminaries section seems to go to great lengths to distinguish between finite- and infinite-horizon games, and between Nash and CCE, but the rest of the paper seems to not really bother too much with these distinctions: the main results (Thms 3.2 and 3.3) both concern Nash equilibrium in games of finite horizon, and the paper doesn't even seem to use CCE at all except in cases where CCE collapses to Nash. Perhaps it is better to frame the paper primarily around Nash in finite-horizon games, and confine the infinite-horizon/CCE case to its own separate section?\n\nIt would be nice to have a table illustrating the relevant distinctions in the paper (turn-based vs switching control vs additive; stationary vs non-stationary; potential vs reward-potential vs adversarial reward-potential; finite vs infinite horizon; CCE vs Nash), and the complexity that arises in each case. That is a very large number of different possible combinations, so it would greatly assist a reader if there were such a summary.\n\nThere are a large number of simple mistakes/omissions which should certainly be fixed before publication because they are significant enough to change the meanings of some theorem statements. Here is a probably-incomplete list of such issues, in roughly decreasing order of importance. (If any of these are not actually errors, then I have misunderstood something; I would greatly appreciate if the authors would clarify any such misunderstandings if they have happened)\n\n1. Cor 4.1: \"is PPAD\" should be \"is PPAD-hard\".\n1. Thm 3.3: Should emphasize that the Nash oracle solves a potential game (perhaps even include the statement of Lemma D.1 in the body to emphasize this); otherwise it's not obvious that the algorithm is efficiently implementable. Also, I would not hide a factor of $n \\max_i |A_i|^{5/2}$ within a big-O---the dependence on these factors should not be ignored.\n1.  Alg 1 should include within its caption something about additive transitions, as that's a necessary condition for the algorithm to work.\n1.  Def 2.1, second bullet: coarse correlated equilibrium should be Nash equilibrium\n1. Def 2.1, second bullet: $s_1$ should be $\\boldsymbol\\rho$\n1. Def 2.1/2.3, first bullet: What's a \"coarse Nash equilibrium\"? I'm assuming this is simply a typo and that it's actually defining just a Nash equilibrium\n1. Def 2.6: need a negative sign on the adversary's reward\n1. pg 7, equation at bottom of page: $0+$ is redundant"

                "value": "1. In the definition of CCE, is a player allowed to \"re-correlate\" after a deviation? For example, could a player deviate at a timestep $h$, and then at a later timestep $h' > h$, resume playing according to the correlated profile?\n1. What's the point of Proposition 4.1? It seems to be some technical observation, assisting in the proof of Theorem 4.1, that may be better placed in the appendix."
