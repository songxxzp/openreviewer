It fills the gap between 2D and 3D foundation generative model. This contribution makes this work not only achieve SOTA 3D generation result, but advances the 3D deep learning. It has potential to influence the 3D learning community as BERT for NLP, or DALLE2/ Muse for 2D generation.\n\n2. The paper figures out a learnable positional encoding to generalize NeRF generation conditioning on 2d image features. The architecture pave the way for other 3D generative models to scale up.\n\n3. The paper drastically improves the generation speed for 3D assets, which will help democratize the technologies in the burgeoning fields like 2d-to-3d or text-to-3d. The potential quasi-real time applications can make 3D content generation more accessible to common users, which in turns, will benefit the development of the community."

As mentioned in the limitation, the back side of the model (e.g., figure 3 penguin) is blurry and besides that, the color tone/ saturation seems a bit inconsistent with the frontal view.\n\n2. The model relies on the correct camera parameters and normalization of camera, which still based on the fact that the objects in the training dataset (objectaverse?) have a certain distribution of orientation. The more general way to formulate the scene is to assume the world coordinate is the camera coordinate (extrinsic = np.eye(4)),  which make the object always face forward to the camera. Although, from the geometric learning works in shapenet, this approach is more challenging than appropriating the object orientation.\n\n3. The approach relies on multiview data which limits the model incorporating more diversity in data source of single view images."

From the example shown in the paper, it seems LRM performs way better than both and more analysis of the better quality is preferred. Is it because LRM use objaverse and MVImage net, both contain much more items than what Point-E and Shap-E use or is it because of the design of learnable positional encoding and other architectures of LRM? More analysis or explanation can further elevate this paper to another level."

I think in Equation(4) the index j' actually refers to the set including j? This equation needs to be revised.\n\n3. In supplementary, some implementation details are missing, for example the number of heads in multi-head attention. In addition I don't clearly understand how does the attention behave between image feature [32x32, 768] and embedding [32x32x3, 1024]? I know when mapping to q,k,v the feature dimension can be changed, but here the token numbers are different. In my understanding it results in weight shape [32x32, 32x32x3] and when multiplied by value, results are in [32x32, 1024] shape. But the next layer requires input as [32x32x3, 1024]?\n\n4. In volume rendering, is the 128 points uniformaly sampled or a two-stage sampling strategy or other sampling methods is adopted?"
