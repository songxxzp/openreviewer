For image-to-text, the model (VisCPM-Chat) is typically pretrained on English image captions by freezing the LM, and then fine-tuned on instruction data translated into the target language(s). The model shows competitive performance when evaluated on machine-translated versions of LLaVA Test Set and UniMM-Bench as evaluated by an off-the-shelf model (GPT-4). For text-to-image, both the text model and the image decoder are frozen, and cross-attention layers are trained using English data. The resulting model (VisCPM-Paint) achieves a lower FID score than previous models on 30K samples from COCO Val obtained through machine translation."

                "value": "1. The paper claims to \u201cgeneralize to other languages in a zero-shot manner.\u201d This is not true, and very misleading. In fact, the chat model had to be fine-tuned on target language data, otherwise it would generate text in English. Calling the behavior \u201cquasi-zero-shot\u201d is also (i) different from the literature, and especially (ii) misleading: the model cannot generate text in the target language without supervision. Such claims, while valid for the text-to-image model, should be removed.\n2. The paper claims to propose \u201can effective training paradigm for training large multimodal models in low-resource languages.\u201d However, none of the languages tested were low-resource. There is a significant difference in the representations of the LM model between high- and low-resource languages, as well as in the quality of translations that an MT system can provide for those languages. None of these things are true for Chinese. Any claims about performance and applicability to low-resource languages need to be removed as they are never verified.\n3. The paper also claims to be multilingual. Yet, most of the experiments are done in a bilingual setup (English+Chinese) or in a few, high-resource European languages. These languages share the same script, similar topology. Claims about multilinguality should be supported by a better selection of languages that increase diversity in scripts, topology, and resource availability.\n4. My other major concerns are related to the experimental setup.\n- (4a) The model is evaluated on unusual benchmarks for multilingual multimodal modeling. These datasets are obtained through machine translation of the corresponding English dataset. The authors claim to fix minor errors (only for Chinese, and not even for all the other 6 European languages), yet do not provide any indication of the quality of the resulting test data. \n- (4b) The evaluation scores are based on GPT-4, which might not understand languages beyond English well. This is an hypothesis that might or might not hold true, but the fact that such concern exists, I believe it is enough to undermine the evaluation setup used by the authors.\n- (4c) There exists multilingual multimodal benchmarks. For instance, IGLUE [1] tests for 4 multimodal tasks in 20 languages, with data *manually* collected by native speakers. MaRVL [2] and XM3600 [3] even include images sourced from the countries where a language is spoken. These benchmarks are adopted in the literature and completely missing (even as part of the related work) in this paper.\n5. There is a lack of discussion of relevant related work. Models like {m,x}UNITER [2], CCLM [4] and TD-MML [5] are missing. The latter in particular shows how machine translation data can be very helpful during pretraining if filtering out poor translations, which provides a contrasting point to the one made by the authors in this paper. A discussion of these findings and how they differ is important to guide the community.\n\n---\n\n[1] Bugliarello et al.

This leverages the Bilingual Dual-coding Theory which states that visual semantics are largely language agnostic. MPM divides the non-English multimodal learning into two consecutive stages: multilingual alignment and multimodal alignment. The former focuses on building a multilingual model by using a pretrained multilingual large language model, while the latter culminates in a multimodal model spanning multiple languages on top of the multilingual model."

Taking the image-to-text generation as an example, in the multimodal pre-training step the proposal is to freeze multilingual LLM and only tune the visual module; in the instruction tuning step the proposal is to finetune everything on the datasets from pivot language and the target language. The multimodal pre-training step is quite straightforward as it aligns a trainable vision model to a pre-trained and frozen LLM; the instruction tuning step is a standard finetuning setup. If the contribution of this paper is to use a pre-trained multilingual LLM to support multilingual downstream tasks, then much more in-depth analysis should be done to justify the point. Examples include understanding the MPM design choices, how freezing LLM affects results, how translated pairs affect instruction tuning results, how many translated pairs are enough and what the trend looks like. \n2. Most of the tables present absolute comparisons, showing how great the proposed method is. However that might be less interesting from a reader's perspective without proper baselines and ablation tests as discussed in the above section (due to different dataset mixtures and tuning tricks used). It's high recommended to take a few tables, and perform multiple in-depth analysis and comparisons with controlled study, to make sure there are enough take aways and confidence in the current MPM design choices."

The remaining languages used for the experiments in Section 5.1.3 are also hardly low-resource: German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese.
