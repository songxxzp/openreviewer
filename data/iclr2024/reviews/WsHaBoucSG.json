The Guide, without knowing the current position of the Tourist, must communicate to provide information about the path to the target position. Using two objective functions, one optimizing for Guide localization of the Tourist and one for optimizing for Tourist navigation, they report better results over previous work on two visual-language navigation datasets."

The lack of any human-annotation in the training process makes it for cheap method to train embodies agents and the ablation study conducted supports the modelling choices made by the authors. Furthermore, the usage of realistic datasets shows that the method can scale to natural setups and is an important step towards deploying agents in the wild. \n\nOverall, I find the only weaknesses to be in the lack of an in-depth analysis of the emergent language. (more in the following section) The only analysis shown is qualitative one and is relegated to the appendix. Although, I don't see it a fundamental requirement to accept the paper, what prevented me from giving it a higher score is the lack of a deeper analysis. \n\nFinally, provided a minor restructuring of the manuscript is done, such as moving the analysis to the main body of the paper, I am in favor of including the paper at the conference."

Computing metrics of emergent languages like topographic similarity (using environment encodings and agent messages) [1] could give an idea of the structure of the agents' protocols. \n\nA minor weakness that I found is the usage of agents without any pre-encoded linguistic knowledge. Using a LLM as navigation planner, which has shown some potential [2, 3], could solve the problem of training agents that have an opaque communication protocol. \nI am thinking that your method could be used as a fine-tuning approach over existing language-aware models, keeping in mind that the language drift problem [4] should be taken into account.

While I'm not challenging your claim, I'm wondering whether it's backed by any analysis work or just by the nature of your sequential communication modules.\n\n- In the training setup section I don't understand why you call the two objective \"pre-training\" tasks. Aren't they used jointly to train the agents? From the paper, I don't understand, the division, if any, between pre-training and training.\n\n- Why do you choose a vocabulary size of 26? I first thought it was to draw a similarity with the English language, but I then realized by looking a figure 3b that it could be the result of an hyperparameter optimization following an ablation study. Could you please clarify?\n\n- In sec 5.5, how do you compute the reduced 2D space? Could please you provide additional details? They could easily be added to the appendix for a camera-ready version\n\n\n---------\n\nmisc/typos\n\n- In section 4.1 you mention Guest position, do you mean Tourist position?\n\n- In the related work section you mention: \"[...] has a similar setting to our work but lets the Guide describe the target position\u2019s observation in a kind of emergent language\". I find \"a kind of emergent language\" unclear, please fix it.\n\n- Please provide a more descriptive Figure 4 caption than the rather vague \"Emergent language analysis\" \n\n- \"Language based\" in the title is probably missing a \"-\" -> Language-based\n\nAnother related paper about navigation and emergent communication is [1].
