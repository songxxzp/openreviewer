A comparison with ODE-based models is essential.\n\nThe paper is generally well-written. However, the model component is difficult to understand; many details are in the appendix.\nThere are issues in the organization of Section 3, particularly in understanding the connection between different modules. For instance, Section 3.2.4, which outlines the overall model architecture, must be presented at the beginning of Section 3, followed by a breakdown of individual module components. The excessive use of subsubsections with limited content also hampers the paper's clarity.
