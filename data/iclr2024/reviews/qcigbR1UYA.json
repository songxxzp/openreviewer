However, in general, it looks hard to find the optimal value of $\\delta$ for an existing sequence of binary tests. \n+  In the two provided experiments, the authors assume that $Y$ is uniformly distributed on some finite set $\\mathcal{Y}$, so $H(Y)=\\log_2(|\\mathcal{Y}|)$. Therefore, the improvements of the authors' bound in Theorem 1 over Loveland's bound (cf. 6), which are shown in Fig. 2 (or Table 1  in Appendix), is mainly originated from a better control of constant factor (depending on $\\delta$). The main interesting contribution that reduces $\\log_2(|\\mathcal{Y}|)$ to $H(Y)$ is not shown in these experiments.  \n+ In Section 5, the authors mention some obtained bounds for noisy tests (via BSC), which are achieved based on the decomposition $T(Y)=D_T(Y)\\oplus N_T$. The design of binary tests to achieve these bounds is based on having knowledge of $D_T(Y)$ (Lemma 2) or $I(T;Y|\\mathcal{A}_{1:t})$ (cf. (1)), which looks very hard to obtain in practice. In addition, the tightness of these bounds is not verified in the paper."

The goal is to minimize the expected number of tests needed to determine the value of Y with the desired confidence. In the case where any possible binary test on the values of $Y$ is available, this problem has been shown to be almost optimally solvable with at most $H(Y)+1$ tests, where $H(Y)$ denoted the entropy, via the information maximization strategy (i.e each time selecting the test with probability closest to $1/2$). However, the authors consider the more practical setting where a specific set $\\mathcal{T}$ of tests is available. The results of the paper identify sufficient conditions that this family of tests has to satisfy in combination with the expected number of tests needed. In particular, the notion of $\\delta$-unpredictability is considered for the test families, where $\\delta$ is a measure of uncertainty for the test outcomes. The main result is that one can identify the value of Y using in expectation $\\frac{H(Y)}{\\log (\u00bd+\\delta)^{-1}}$ test from a $\\delta$-unpredictable family using the greedy information maximization strategy. This setting is also extended to the case where the test outcomes are noisy as a result of independently passing through a binary symmetric channel and a similar result is shown involving an additional parameter $\\gamma$ representing the target confidence for the value of $Y$."
