However, this eliminates the dependency of data over time, which is typical and expected for time-series. Hence, this seems very restrictive for the purpose of theoretical analyses, and it is important to discuss what this assumption actually imposes on the data collection process.\n\n2. The simulation performance of CopulaCPTS seems very similar to Copula [Messoudi et al. 2021], which notably was not developed for this setting. I think this goes back to the assumption on $z^i$ being i.i.d., where the use of CopulaCPTS is not essential under the absence of temporal dependency.\n\n3. Performance of Copula on real-data examples is not reported.\n\n4. Given that Copula does not seem to under-perform much, I think additional comparison is needed. For example, the locally ellipsoid CP in [Ellipsoidal conformal inference for Multi-Target Regression](https://copa-conference.com/papers/COPA2022_paper_7.pdf) by [Messoudi et al. 2022]"

Notably, Messoudi et al. have previously proposed a similar approach, even employing the same empirical copula. While the authors assert that their contribution is the multivariate nature of every entry, it's important to note that the nonconformity score remains scalar. Therefore, the process of conformal prediction remains largely the same as in the univariate case. \n\n(2) Another notable issue pertains to data type. While this paper primarily focuses on time series, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the temporal aspect of the data may not be as critical as initially assumed. The dataset comprises numerous time series, and each data point within these series appears to be exchangeable with one another. This exchangeability is what enables the application of conformal prediction. Furthermore, it's crucial to differentiate this work from other studies that delve into conformal prediction methods that extend beyond exchangeability."
