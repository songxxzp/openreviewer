The author argues that the existing simulation environment cannot accurately replicate city-specific driving behaviors and proposes to assess realism by measuring the planning performance when replaying recorded human driver logs within the simulation. While the behavior of agents in the existing simulation environment is governed by a set of hyperparameters, such as maximum acceleration and deceleration, the author proposes a city specific environment by tuning these hyper-parameters according to human motion planning performance.   Then, a MPC based city-specific motion planner is introduced by identifying the city through map classification and utilizing city-specific world models. The authors conducted an evaluation using a public motion planning benchmark."

The simulated agents may just behave more diversely in the simulation which could cause the replayed human driving logs to have a poor planning performance due to collisions. In fact, some could argue that realistic simulation requires the non-playable agents to be flexible and diverse while behaving realistically in distribution[1]. Extensive clarification on the reason for using replay human logs as an measurement of realism would be needed. \n\nI think the proposed work depends heavily on the previous success of PDM-C planner which is not carefully discussed in this paper.\n\nI am not sure if I would say the author proposed city-specific gyms \"closely model real-world behavior statistics\" in Figure 1.

The limitation is that in the simulation, when controlling other vehicles with rule-based planners, they are always projected to the road, including the parked cars. This makes the simulation unrealistic. They address the limitation by allowing the other vehicles to follow their ground-truth trajectories while still being reactive. Experiments show that this makes the simulation more realistic, based on the metric to what extent can the simulator reproduce the behaviors of other vehicles when the ego-vehicle follows the ground-truth trajectory. \n\nSecond, the authors argue that each city has its own dynamics and challenges. As such, for better evaluation of the planners, we should make city-specific benchmark scenario. To do so, they optimize the behaviors of other agents for each city using city-pecific data. Experiments show that without surprise, the planner that uses a generic model performs in city-specific benchmark scenarios. To improve the performance, the authors propose to learn a classifer to identify the current city and use the corresponding model to do rollouts during planning. Experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of this approach."

It focuses on a single pre-existing simulator. The realism of simulation is measured and improved on a single metric: accuracy of other agents if the ego-vehicle follows ground-truth. This metric ignores other important factors regarding the realism of simulation: what happens if the ego-vehicle does not follow ground-truth. \n\nThe second contribution, making a number of models for a number of scenarios and using a classifer to learn to use which model for the current scenario during planning, is also not novel. Moreover, I don't find this method promising. First of all, there is an issue of scalabilities. When there are more cities, you need to make more models, and the classifer needs to be bigger. Second, there is an issue of generalization. What if the vehicle is running in an unseen city. Third, apart from the city, there are many other factors that could affect the dynamics, such as if it is peak hour."

However, upon reading the paper, it appears that the problem is addressed using an existing planner rather than introducing a new one. This discrepancy between the stated contribution and the actual content may benefit from clarification.\n\nAs a result, presentation of the work itself is a probably one of the main weaknesses.\n\nAdditionally, the paper could be strengthened by discussing various methodologies to assess realism. Incorporating statistical measures such as summary statistics, event counts, time intervals between events, or probability distributions could offer a more comprehensive evaluation. The current approach might inadequately capture infrequent but significant events. It is also possible that the methods employed are not described in sufficient detail to fully convey their scope and impact.\n\nAs a more general idea I'm wondering if it would be worthwhile looking at the individual distributions more closely to investigate the performance of the default behaviors as a result of averaging out multiple modalities; potentially could be solved by combining GMM/MPC where the GMM model the behavior of the traffic. There's quite a bit of work on stochastic MPC in the context of autonomous driving, including non-gaussian trajectory planning, and insights into how this work applies to the given problem would be interesting.\n(possible relevant references eg https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9133136 or https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10999)\n\nMinor comments:\n- I don't think introduction of the \"Gym\" terminology is necessary\n- If I understand correctly, the plots in figure 1 are from 2 simulators and the real world.
