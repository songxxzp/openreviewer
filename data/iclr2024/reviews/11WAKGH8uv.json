                "value": "Abstract and Introduction\nThe paper proposes a unified end-to-end Federated Learning (FL) framework for Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) named FedAIoT. The framework is benchmarked across multiple IoT datasets and incorporates a variety of data partitioning schemes, preprocessing techniques, models, and FL hyperparameters. Despite its comprehensive approach, the paper lacks a comparative study with existing state-of-the-art solutions. Moreover, while the paper mentions the inclusion of popular schemes and models in its framework, it doesn't substantiate why these were chosen over other potential candidates.\n\nEquations and Mathematical Formulations\nThe paper briefly touches upon the Dirichlet distribution for creating non-IID data partitions and mentions metrics like accuracy and Mean Average Precision (MAP-50). However, it lacks mathematical rigor. For instance, the Dirichlet distribution is mentioned but not defined. A formal definition, perhaps along with its probability density function, would have given more depth. Furthermore, there are no equations to represent the FL optimizers like FedAvg and FedOPT, which makes it difficult to appreciate the nuances or compare them.\n\nTables and Figures\nTable 1: While useful for a cursory comparison, this table lacks depth. For example, it could include a comparison based on performance metrics to provide an analytical foundation for its claims.\n\nFigure 1 and 2: These figures provide an overview but lack detail. For example, Figure 2 could be improved by including the types of IoT-specific preprocessing techniques or by detailing the architecture of the proposed IoT-friendly models.\n\nTable 4: This table summarizes the performance metrics but lacks confidence intervals or p-values, which are essential for ascertaining the statistical significance of the results.\n\nTable 5: While this table attempts to show the impact of client sampling ratios, it doesn't explain why only two ratios (10% and 30%) were chosen for comparison.\n\nDataset and Experimental Design\nThe paper includes a wide range of datasets, which is commendable. However, it doesn't provide any rationale for the specific choice of datasets. Furthermore, no information is given about the train-test split methodology. Was it random or stratified? The partitioning schemes for these datasets are discussed, but there is a lack of empirical justification for why these schemes are effective or superior to existing methods.\n\nAlgorithms and Techniques\nThe paper discusses various FL optimizers, data partitioning schemes, and IoT-friendly models, but there is a lack of justification for the chosen methods. For example, why were FedAvg and FedOPT selected as FL optimizers? Are they computationally less expensive or do they converge faster?\n\nResults and Discussion\nThe paper presents a broad range of results but lacks a discussion comparing these results to existing benchmarks or state-of-the-art methods. The paper would benefit from including such a comparative analysis.\n\nInsufficient Empirical Validation\nThe experiments conducted are somewhat limited in scope and scale. Only a few datasets are considered, and they seem to belong to similar domains. This raises questions about the model's generalizability. Moreover, the paper lacks ablation studies, making it difficult to understand the contribution of each component of the proposed method.\n\nActionable Insight: Include a broader array of datasets from varying domains to validate the model. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of each component or parameter.\n\nAbsence of Comparative Analysis\nWhile the paper aims to introduce a novel methodology, there is an absence of a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods. Without this, the paper falls short of convincingly establishing the proposed method's superiority or novelty.\n\nActionable Insight: Include comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative terms. This could be in the form of performance metrics, computational efficiency, or even qualitative assessments based on real-world applicability.\n\nMathematical Rigor\nThe paper would significantly benefit from a more rigorous mathematical treatment of the proposed algorithm. Currently, it seems to rely more on empirical observations. Given your stated goals of developing proper mathematical models, this is an area that requires attention.\n\nActionable Insight: Introduce formal proofs or derivations that can substantiate the algorithm's properties, such as stability, convergence, or robustness. Include theoretical justifications for the choices made in the algorithm's design.\n\nLack of Discussion on Limitations\nEvery model has its limitations, and acknowledging them not only adds credibility but also helps in guiding future work.\n\nActionable Insight: Devote a section to discuss the limitations of the proposed method and potential avenues for future research."

How do these assumptions align with the real-world scenarios where the model is expected to be deployed?\n\nMethodological Choices: What was the rationale behind the selection of specific hyperparameters and architectural elements in the proposed model? Some clarification on this could strengthen the paper's methodological grounding.\n\nEvaluation Metrics: The paper uses a particular set of metrics for evaluation. Could the authors elucidate why these metrics are most suitable for assessing the model's performance? Are there any other metrics that were considered but not used?\n\nComputational Complexity: How does the computational complexity of the proposed method compare with existing state-of-the-art methods? Could the authors provide a detailed analysis in this regard?\n\nScalability: The paper does not discuss how well the proposed method scales with the size of the dataset. Could the authors provide insights or supplementary experiments that address this?\n\nAblation Study: The absence of an ablation study leaves some questions about the necessity of each component of the proposed model. Could the authors provide such an analysis in the rebuttal or an extended version of the paper?\n\nTheoretical Guarantees: Are there any theoretical guarantees, such as convergence or bounds, that can be associated with the proposed algorithm? If yes, this would be a valuable addition to the paper.\n\nLimitations: Every model has its shortcomings.

It isn't clear whether this is competing work, or work by the authors of the submitted paper. In either case, it seems highly relevant but does not appear to be cited. One way to deal with this problem within the blind review process is to cite the work, but use an entry such as \"Redacted for blind review\" in the bibliography during the review process. Another paper, \"FedML: A Research Library and Benchmark for Federated Machine Learning\" claims to support IoT devices. I am not claiming that those papers are identical to this work, but they seem close enough to merit contrasting them with the author's benchmark. I view this as a substantial weakness, but one that might be resolved via rebuttals and simple revision.\n\n+ The modifications to the curated datasets are not well justified.

If so, does that mean that centralized training and evaluation must be redone to enable noisy labeling whenever an algorithm changes? Or is there something fundamental about the confusion matrix, i.e., is it unlikely to change much when models change?\n\n 2) Why not leave the sounds in raw format instead of converting to the frequency domain with particular parameters? Isn't this sort of raw data to feature conversion part of the approaches your benchmarks will be used to evaluate? If so, why build one particular approach to feature extraction into the benchmarks?\n\n3) What is the purpose of Section 4? To demonstrate that the benchmarks can be used to compare optimizers? Enabling comparison doesn't imply enabling comparison yielding correct ranking of optimizers. If you could demonstrate that the findings using your benchmarks differ from those using the most closely related existing (perhaps even non-IoT) benchmarks, and your benchmarks are more typical of applications in the IoT domain, that would support your claim that your benchmarks are more useful in this domain than prior work."
