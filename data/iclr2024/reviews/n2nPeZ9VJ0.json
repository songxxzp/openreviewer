The authors argue for the superiority of the proposed strategy, but the reasoning behind this claim is not adequately explained. The analysis is limited to a single dataset addressing a specific problem, which is insufficient to draw conclusive results. It remains uncertain whether this strategy would be effective for non-private EHR data. Why exactly it is good for private EHR data?\n2. The evaluation involves only one model, whereas related work typically considers a subset of models for a more comprehensive assessment.\n3. The experimental results do not sufficiently clarify why this strategy is advantageous. For example, it's unclear whether model size plays a significant role in its effectiveness. Furthermore, an error analysis comparing the proposed strategy to other strategies could provide valuable insights.\n4.
