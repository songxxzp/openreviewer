                "value": "The paper proposes a new method for **token pruning** in vision transformers, called `TC-ViT`. Most token pruning methods discard tokens based on their attention score relatively to the class token. \n\nIn contrast, `TC-ViT` also considers higher order connectivity between tokens: First, a fully-connected graph between tokens is considered. The first-level connectivity scores are obtained from the attention matrix $W$. The second-level connectivity scores $C_2(i, j)$ are obtained with a message-passing like process: essentially summing attention score along all the paths of length 2 from node $i$ to $j$. And this process can be iterated to obtain higher-level connectivity scores. \nA second score, the dominance $D$ is obtained by considering the attention-score of each token to the class token, similarly to other token pruning methods. The final \"relevance\" score of each token is obtained as a weighted sum of both the connectivity and dominance values.\nThen, in each layers, the tokens are split into two groups (highly relevant set $P$ and  not relevant ones $Q$); All irrelevant tokens in $Q$ are matched to their closest tokens in $P$, which are in turn updated/fused with the relevant tokens in $Q$. After being fused, the irrelevant tokens are discarded.\n\nFinally, the proposed method is evaluated on the task of image classification for two backbones (`DeiT`-based and `LV-ViT/S`) and compared to several token pruning baselines. In addition, the paper considers several ablation experiments such as comparing the impact of the connectivity and dominance scores, whether to use the fusion strategy etc."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- **Unclear motivation**: Based on the introduction and results, it is not clear to me which is the main gap that the paper tries to adress:\n  - For instance, when comparing to other token pruning methods, the introduction states that \"*only discarding tokens will incur performance loss as even those less important tokens*\" -> however, one could argue that merging tokens may also result in loss of information.  Furthermore, there are already existing methods such as \"*EViT: Expediting vision transformers via token reorganizations, Liang et al, ICLR 2022*\" which proposes to fuse all pruned tokens into one token, rather than discarding them.\n  - Similarly, about token merging methods, the introduction mention that \"*They also overlook the potential influence of other tokens on the\nrelationships between two tokens when analyzing their interactions*\" -> However, when looking at the ablation experiments in **Table 8**, it seems that using a connectivity factor of $K = 1$ actually yields better performance than most of the higher connectivity values $K \\in \\{4, 8, 32\\}$. This would indicate that higher-order relationships between tokens are not so meaningful for token pruning. Similarly, from the ablation in **Table 3**, it seems that the *dominance* score (i.e. the same attention to class token used in other token pruning methods) has a more significant impact on accuracy than *connectivity*.\n\n\n- **Missing training hyperparmeters**: The experimental section is not very clear on the training setup of baselines. In particular, on whether **(i)** all baselines are trained from scratch or finetuned, **(ii)** how long they are trained for and **(iii)** whether they include distillation or not. Because of this and the fact that the accuracy gap is generally small, it is hard to interpret the results from **Table 1**; Furthermore, many results seem to directly come from their respective original paper, which might have a different training pipeline;  To give some examples of potential different training pipelines:\n  - For DeiT-S The results reported for `EviT` (79.5% accuracy at 3.9GFlops) corresponds to the version trained from scratch for 300 epochs without distillation. If finetuned from a pretrained model, the original work reports 79.8% accuracy. Similarly for `ToME`, the results seems to correspond to training from scratch from the original paper.\n  - According to the original paper, `HeatViT` also applies 8-bit quantization to weights/activations after token pruning, so the accuracy might not be directly comparable."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- **Making the fuse operation discrete:** In Section 3.2, the fusing operation is described as a discrete matching, where all irrelevant tokens are matched to its most relevant preserved tokens and fused. Since the goal is to maximally preserve the information container in the discarded tokens, would it be possible to fuse all irrelevant tokens into all preserved tokens, weighted by their connectivity score ?\n\n- **Cost of the select/fuse operation**: It would be interesting to report a more precise breakdown of the compute cost in terms of **(i)** computational cost from running the transformer versus **(ii)** computational cost from computing the connectivity score and selecting/fusing tokens. \n\n- **Minor suggestion on writing:** The use of *could* in the method section is a bit confusing, as it is not clear if the paper describes something that the authors tried/considered, or something that is actually part of the final proposed method. For instance, in Section 3.2 \"*we could sort these tokens from large to small. Because the time cost of each module of our method is not high, we could insert it into every transformer block between attention layer and mlp layer*"

                "value": "- The authors conducted several ablation experiments to validate the design choices mentioned in Section 3, but there are no direct comparisons between different token fusion strategies. As mentioned in the abstract, the authors claim that previous methods \"do not consider carefully how to select tokens\". To support this claim, I think it is necessary to provide direct evidence instead of the final performance of the whole system to show the superiority of the proposed designs. For example, ToMe (Bolya et al., 2023) presents a token fusion solution with bipartite matching. The method can achieve 79.3% with 2.7 GFLOPs without training based on AugReg ViT-S (Table 4). If the method can better select and fuse tokens, will the proposed method achieve better performance? Since obtaining the results doesn't require training, the comparisons can also reduce the effects of training techniques and settings. \n\n- Why are there some missing numbers of FLOPs or throughput in Table 1 and 6? Are these results better than the proposed method? The code and models of most of these methods like ToMe and DynamicViT are publically available and widely used in previous work. I think it is easy to obtain the throughput of these models. It is also strange that you cannot obtain FLOPs of Evo-ViT while can measure the throughput of this model.  \n\n- Several recent token fusion/pruning methods [r1,r2,r3,r4] have extended this group of methods to more complex scenarios like convolution backbones and dense prediction tasks. Only conducting experiments on ImageNet based on DeiT and LVViT may make the work less competitive. \n\n[r1] Joint Token Pruning and Squeezing Towards More Aggressive Compression of Vision Transformers, CVPR 23\n[r2] ToMe (Bolya et al., 2023)\n[r3] Dynamic Spatial Sparsification for Efficient Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks, TPAMI 23\n[r4] Dynamic Token Pruning in Plain Vision Transformers for Semantic Segmentation ICCV 23"
