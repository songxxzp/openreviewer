The authors supported the significance of the problem from Shanon and Weaver's Information Theory, and they carefully posed this problem into a text-to-text problem so researchers can now explore ways to tackle this problem via LLMs. \n\n2. The paper introduced a large dataset of behavior-content data, as well as a test benchmark that comprehensively evaluates an LLM's ability to reason about content behavior and communication effects (including some human-annotated ground truths). These contributions will be very valuable for future researchers working on communication effectiveness or other related problems.\n\n3. The paper introduced a novel method to fine-tune LLMs for behavior understanding, and their resulting 13B parameter model outperformed GPT-4/GPT-3.5, often by large margins, on most tasks in content behavior test benchmark, which is really impressive.\n\n4.

The authors claimed that the paper studies the problem of predicting and optimizing communication for desired receiver behaviors and intents, i.e., the effectiveness level of communication, but what the authors actually did in this paper is simply exploring the Youtube and email datasets. As far as I understand, the key to improve the performance of behavior/content prediction and understanding is to improve the general reasoning ability of LLMs, rather than finetuning LLMs on specific datasets. From this perspective, the contribution of this paper is very limited.\n\n2. In terms of presentation, I think the authors make things too complicated by discussing the effectiveness and behavior issues, which make the readers hard to quickly get the main idea and contribution of this paper.\n\n3. The behavior simulation task sounds like a data mining problem, e.g. predicting whether a user will watch a video. LLMs are not quite suitable for such tasks because they are too slow and they cannot make use of massive user-item interaction data."
