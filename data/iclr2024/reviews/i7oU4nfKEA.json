The authors pretrained more than 10,000 models over 250 languages under different settings. The authors drew various conclusions according to their experiments and showed that massively multilingual pretraining may only be beneficial for some languages, while more targeted models, e.g., monolingual models, may perform much better."

Therefore this is only a concern but not a suggestion to do more experiments.\n\n- I found some parts of the papers are a bit repetitive.

And the size for multilingual vocab is set to 32K tokens, which is the same as the monolingual tokenizer. Is this a limitation since 32K tokens might not be enough to support ten languages (especially when the scripts of the ten languages are different)?\n\n- In the very interesting part of \"Syntactic similarity of added languages drives results\", the authors mentioned that abstract linguistic similarity might be more beneficial than surface-level similarity. I was wondering how conceptual similarity [1] would hold in this case. Could the authors give any thought to this?\n\n- The authors mentioned that the degradation is even slightly larger when the added languages are \"similar\" to the target languages. This sounds a bit counter-intuitive. Could the authors give some possible explanations?\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08475.pdf"

Through the carried out experiments, this work clarifies the already-known effects of multilingual pre-training on low-resource and high-resource languages. For example, it shows that adding multilingual data improves low-resource language modeling performance, similar to increasing low-resource dataset sizes by up to 33% while the high-resource performance degradations when adding multilingual data can be similar to reducing high-resource dataset sizes by over 85%. And that the improvements depend on syntactic and lexical similarities of the added multilingual data."

Because the obtained results already show that low-resource languages clearly benefit from multilinguality and that the high-resource performance degradation reduces as the model size increases. Providing supportive arguments regarding this claim might be useful.\n\n2. While the authors carried out a dramatic number of experiments, they do not provide detailed reasons why such a huge amount of computing resources would be needed. I assume selecting a set of languages that represent specific scenarios would be enough to get supportive results. And that could help in securing some resources that could be used to evaluate relatively larger language models which could have probably given a different picture of the results.\n\n3. The performance of most LLMs is often assessed through downstream task performance since the pre-training loss cannot always fully explain downstream performance (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/liu23ao.html). I am wondering why the evaluation of LLMs on downstream tasks was not included.\n\n4. In the first line of page 6, it was mentioned that a total of 8454 multilingual language models were pre-trained while in the abstract it was mentioned that over 10000 models were trained. Is that a typo?\n\n**Minor:**\nPossible formatting issue: in the current ICLR paper format, the titles of the table should be at the top of it instead of the bottom."

They show that adding multilingual training data improves low-resource language performance. They show that multilingual training hurts high-resource languages. They show that language similarity matters, more similar being better of course. Possibly more novel is that they show that for language similarity syntactic similarity matters - which is unexpected. But by syntactic similarity they mean the syntactic component of lang2vec which is taken from the WALS typological database so these are syntactic features collected by linguists not syntactic trees over the language. \n\nOverall the paper was very ambitious with the scale of the experiments (trained over 10000 language models - even if they were all very small up to 45M paramteres).
