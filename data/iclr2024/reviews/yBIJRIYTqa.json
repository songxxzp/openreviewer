                "value": "(1) There are some implicit assumptions that are not well justified. Firstly, the authors say that B=\\omega (T) which seems not practical as it is not evident in which real-world situations a direct linear relationship exists between the budget and the total number of rounds T. A constant budget will result in a non-sublinear final upper regret bound. Secondly, the range of the replenishable resource \\beta is [-1,0] which indicates that such amount of source is close to the consumption cost of other action. This, in turn, suggests that the policy will frequently favor the empty action once the budget B is depleted. It would be beneficial to offer motivating real-world scenarios that illustrate the relevance and feasibility of such a resource range. Finally, in the example of the inventory management in Section 6.2, the reward action s is r_t(s)\\in [-1,0] which is not consistent with the setting in Section 2. Please give a clear justification for this variation.\n(2) The Meta-Algorithm proposed in this paper appears to be a trivial extension of the one presented in \"Online Learning with Knapsacks: the Best of Both Worlds\" (2022). The main difference is that the policy does the empty action when the budget is smaller than one. Furthermore, in terms of theoretical analysis, although the concept of a replenishable resource is introduced, the proofs for Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.3 do not exhibit significant advancement when compared to the proofs for Theorem 6.1 and Theorem 7.1 of the 2022\u2019s work. Please clarify the primary contribution compared with previous literature.\n(3) The paper would benefit from the design of experiments to provide stronger empirical support for the theoretical findings.\n \nMinor Comments:\nPage 4: note --> Note\nPage 9: simple simple --> simple"

In a BwK problem, there are m (m > 1) different types of cost for each action, and the agents needs to maximize the cumulative rewards (i.e., minimize the cumulative regret) before any resource runs out. In classic bandit setting, there is only one cost which is time, so the standard MAB problem is a special case of BwK.\n\nIn this paper, the cost of each action can be negative, whereas the previous BwK works only study the cases where the costs are non-negative. This new setting simulates the real-world applications (eg inventory management and Bilateral trade given in the paper) where the resources can be recovered with time. \n\nThis paper gives a general primal-dual algorithms for this new setup. In both of adversarial and stochastic bandit settings, this paper achieves nearly optimal results (linear gaps for adversarial and logarithm gaps for stochastic). To be specific, in the adversarial case, no algorithm can achieve sub-linear regrets, and the proposed algorithm only has constant gap to the lower bound. In the stochastic case, the algorithm achieves \\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T \\log{mT}}) regret upper bound (note that the trivial lower bound is \\Omega(\\sqrt{T}))."
