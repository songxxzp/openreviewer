                "value": "The paper proposes a new goal-conditioned reinforcement learning framework that leverages foundation models to accelerate learning, named Foundation Reinforcement Learning (FRL). FRL consists of three components, policy, value, and reward priors. To construct the policy prior, FRL utilize a pre-trained video generation model and an inverse dynamics model and distill them to a lightweight policy network. To construct the value prior, FRL uses VIP, which trains a universal value function on internet-scale robotic dataset, without fine-tuning. Finally, FRL uses 0-1 success function as the reward prior. FRL achieves superior performance compared to RL-only or foundation-only model methods on Meta-World."

It looks like what happened in this paper is that the authors simply substituted the value and policy functions in the vanilla actor-critic with the VIP (Ma et al., 2022) model and the UniPi (Du et al., 2023) model, respectively. The so-called Reward Foundation Prior is still a 0-1 success signal as in the vanilla actor-critic framework. By doing so, the authors peddle a concept of foundation reinforcement learning. This manuscript looks like an empirical study of recent rl foundation models, without new theoretical contributions. \n2. The experimental results mainly demonstrate that by simultaneously using Unipi and VIP, the proposed method learns faster than DrQ-v2 (ICLR 2022), while the proposed method is only compared (or comparable) to DrQ-v2, other methods either do not involve training (Unipi and Prior) or yield a success rate of 0% (R3M) in 6 out of 8 tasks. (See fig. 2). Also, experiments are insufficient. All the experiments are conducted in a simple environment. The proposed method is compared to a limited number of baselines. Experiments on more SOTA baselines and investigation of more foundation models are welcome.\n2. From my perspective, I don't think the proposed method can be claimed as a brand new \"Foundation Reinforcement Learning\" framework since it simply uses two existing foundation methods."

If the authors aim to propose a framework for foundation RL, they should discuss 1. the concrete form in which to represent embodied foundation priors and 2. how to learn such a foundation model from the dataset. However, they didn't propose a new form for embodied foundation priors but leveraged existing embodied foundation priors(Unipi and VIP).\n \nI think what the authors did, is to argue that both \"Foundation Models for Policy Learning\" and \"Foundation Models for Representation Learning\" in related works are important.  Unipi's policy prior is empirically weak due to a lack of interaction with the environment, while VIP's representation prior has not been fully leveraged. The authors propose novel ways to leverage VIP and combine the strengths of Unipi to achieve better performance."

Eventhough paper mention about using foundation priors for policy, value and success-reward the results use ground truth success-reward and do not show any results with foundation success-reward prior. Given the proposed contribution is a framework with foundation prior in policy, value and success-reward it is essential that authors present results with a foundation prior for success reward as well. \n2. The proposed foundation actor critic algorithm is a simple extension to DrQv2 which just adds a KL constraint to the prior foundation policy. This idea of using a KL constraint is very common in RL finetuning literature where we have a access to pretrained policy (trained using demonstrations or any other prior data) that we want to finetune with RL. \n3. The experimental setup is quite simple and doesn\u2019t present extensive comparison with other baselines. For example, how does using a policy prior pretrained on a small dataset collected using a DRQv2 perform in comparison with the UniPi data? It is unclear if using data collected from a finetuned foundation model like UniPi is better than any other policy trained using in-domain data.\n4. Comparison is only presented with DRQv2, R3M and other zero-shot baselines like UniPi and Prior. The experiment section needs to be expanded and compared with other commonly used baselines and SOTA methods on MetaWorld\n5. Experiments are only presented in 1 simple environment where results on some tasks are not that convincing. For example, in figure 3 ablations results on button-press-topdown task shows that FAC vs FAC w.o. policy prior performs almost the same. Similarly, on door-open task FAC vs FAC w.o value prior performs almost the same. It is unclear from this experimental setup whether each component of the framework is important. Authors need to present experiments on more complex environments to clearly demonstrate importance of each component.\n6. The core contribution of FRL is using foundation priors for RL training but in the experiments authors finetune the UniPi distilled policy with in-domain data which raises concerns that whether the policy prior benefits are coming purely from small in-domain finetuning or from base UniPi demonstrations that are used for distillation. It is essential that to disentangle these factors and present detailed ablations in the experiments."
