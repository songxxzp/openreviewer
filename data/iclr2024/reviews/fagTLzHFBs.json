The authors propose Decomposition-Interpolation Block (DIB) to break down feature maps into discrete time indexed parts and interpolate them accordingly to obtain the target frame. The authors identify the non-triviality of affine transformation in the latent space. To address this, they decompose each part of the latent representation into a scalar field and a gradient field and train an AffNet to estimate the affine transformation in the feature space. The authors also introduce several objectives to optimize the proposed network. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of LDiNet compared to existing methods."

Although interpolating in hidden space seems to have some intuitive benefits, and the proposed network achieve empirically improvements, the authors do not seem to provide ablation study to verify the improvement of DIB module. The authors should conduct further experiments to explore the impact of the DIB module and add some understanding experiments if possible to illustrate how DIB \"exploits the intrinsic structure of the latent space\" and thus benefiting the deblatting. \n3. I have some doubts about the performance of the proposed method. Though there are only three datasets evaluated in this paper, there are no improvements of PSNR and SSIM on TbD. The improvement of PSNR on TbD-3D also seems marginal. It might be more convincing if the authors ran multiple random seeds and provided the mean and standard deviation or provide results on more datasets."

Then, these feature maps are interpolated using a new Decomposition-Interpolation Block. Finally, the object is then decoded and rendered at the required time index.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "### **AffNet, scalar and gradient fields**\nI do not fully understand why there is a need to split the latent space into scalar and gradient fields. I acknowledge that Table 4 shows that treating everything as scalar (the straightforward case) leads to slightly lower scores. However, I'd like to see an ablation where the feature maps are simply interpolated by linear interpolation. Wouldn't automatic backpropagation (e.g. in PyTorch) solve this? In this case, there is no need for AffNet. P_t's are simply interpolated and become Q_t, without any overhead from AffNet. This is a very important ablation.\n\nOn page 4, it says that P''(x) is equal to the gradient of the scalar field S_t, but the scalar field was already defined as P'(x). Is P'(x) = S(x)?\n\n### **Changes w.r.t. DeFMO**\nMany parts and loss functions are reused from the DeFMO method. However, some have been modified. For instance, the reconstruction loss compares generated images (I_t) concatenated with the background instead of comparing appearances (F_t), as in DeFMO. Is this change important? Does it bring improvement?\n\n### **Equation (6)**\nThe sum that denotes the number of pixels within the FMO blur should rather be written as $\\sum_D \\sum_{\\tau} (M_{\\tau} > 0)$. Otherwise, I don't understand how it can normalize the losses. Moreover, why is this normalization different for the first (without $>0$) and the second term (with $>0$)?\n\n### **Feature consistency loss**\nFeature consistency loss (9) penalizes the differences between adjacent latent feature maps. It means that it's minimized when all latent maps are the same, which shouldn't be the case if the goal is to capture a moving object. This is similar to the time-consistency loss in DeFMO, which at least contains normalized cross-correlation that allows for some movement. In contrast, the feature consistency loss prefers only identical feature maps.\n\n### **Table 2 (arch)**\nArch. (bi-branched) ablation is not clear. The paper says that it provides improvement by separating the estimation of the appearance and the mask. Does it mean that otherwise, they are not separated? What does it even mean? This is very confusing. \n\nIn general, I'd like to see more ablations on the architecture side, e.g. does it make sense to introduce AffNet at all? How is it dependent on pre-training?\n\n### **Experimental results**\nIt's not clear how many times was each ablation/experiment run before reporting the results. Is it run only once? In general, it's always good to run many times and provide mean/std values of each score. For now, it's not clear how much the improvement is contributed by randomness. For example, in Table 3, when the number of parts is set to 20, the scores go down compared to 16. Is it expected?\n\n### **Typos**\nThere are many typos in the paper:\n- Abstract: with backgrounds -> with background\n- Abstract: the feature maps of the long blur is -> are\n- Abstract: experiments are conducted and has shown -> have shown\n- Intro (p1): which is accordance -> is in accordance\n- Conclusion: feature maps is -> feature maps are\n\n\n### **Other comments**\n- \"Conventional methods mostly recover a clear image at the median of the motion\": this is not true, I'd even say they recover a clear image at an arbitrary location of the motion.\n- This method is not compared against SfB, which is fine since SfB is used more like a post-processing on top of DeFMO, meaning that the proposed method can actually be used to get better results from SfB. However, it would be really nice to see SfB results if this new method is used for silhouette estimation. I believe SfB would perform even better."
