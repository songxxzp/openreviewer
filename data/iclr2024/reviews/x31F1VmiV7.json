                "value": "1. The paper is hard to follow. Key details of the proposed attack are missing in the paper. First, how to get the text filter and the image filter? How do we calculate text/image filter scores s_t and s_i? Second, what is the model architecture of the text encoder used in the retriever? How do we get this text encoder? Should this text encoder share a similar architecture or parameters with the image generator? Third, how to use black-box LLM API to generate the modified prompt x_s? Is there any specific prompt used for the generation? Does the LLM API has to be close to the text encoder used in image generator?\n2. The novelty of this paper is limited. The attack framework of using LLM and diffusion models to generate NSFW images has been investigated in many recent works (See comment 4). The proposed text retrieval mainly aims to train a surrogate model to simulate the text encoder in the image generator, and then attack the surrogate model to achieve black-box attacks. This idea is also straightforward. \n3. The proposed attack leverages black-box LLM APIs to generate texts and images. However, the process can be inhibited if the LLM service provider identifies and blocks the generation of malicious content. If the malicious content is detected frequently, the service provider may stop providing services to the attacker. \n4. Recent attacks and defenses on text-to-image generation have not been compared or discussed in the paper. For example, [1-3] have investigated potential attacks for T2I models. Safety filtering [4] and concept removal [5,6] techniques have been proposed to defend against these attacks. The comparison with zeroth-order optimization methods is also missing in the evaluation. \n5. The proposed attack does not perform well on black-box APIs. The ASR on SD is merely around 10%. In addition, there is a big discrepancy between filter-based ASR and human-based ASR in the results, which needs further clarification.\n\n[1] Rando, Javier, Daniel Paleka, David Lindner, Lennart Heim, and Florian Tram\u00e8r. \"Red-teaming the stable diffusion safety filter.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.04610 (2022).\n[2] Qu, Yiting, Xinyue Shen, Xinlei He, Michael Backes, Savvas Zannettou, and Yang Zhang. \"Unsafe diffusion: On the generation of unsafe images and hateful memes from text-to-image models.\" ACM CCS 2023.\n[3] Zhi-Yi Chin, Chieh-Ming Jiang, Ching-Chun Huang, Pin-Yu Chen, and Wei-Chen Chiu.

Since the image or textual filters of the commercial APIs such as DALLE-3 are not accessible, the transferability of the outputs obtained by their pipeline remains a question.\n\n- the fairness of evaluation metric: this paper includes the proportion of their generated images rejected by the image filter as the part of attack success rate (ASR). However, in the real case, commercial APIs would not return those images if their image filter recognizes its NSFW content. So, including such metric in ASR may by not fair.\n\n- the experiment results show no great advantage over human instruction attack, TLA. in Table 1, the toxic rate of TLA is lower than BSPA, which means the output of BSPA is less stealthy than TLA. As for ASR_hum, BSPA is 3.8\\%, gaining little advantage than 1.66\\% of TLA. Moreover, in Table 3, with their proposed RSF filter, the explicit attack achieves 3.6\\% better performance than BSPA, which raises the doubt of the generality of the RSF filter.\n\n[1] Javier Rando, Daniel Paleka, David Lindner, Lennard Heim, and Florian Trame`r.
