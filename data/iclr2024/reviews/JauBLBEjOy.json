In contrast to the existing work, this method can animate the avatar using the underlying SMPL structure. This is a coarse to fine pipeline where in the coarse stage a residual prediction scheme over SMPL using NERF is proposed which is used to initiaise in the fine stage. In the fine stage DMTet (deep Marching tetrahedra) is used create a high resolution avatar. Further there is a part aware superresolution. For text conditioning, the method uses score distillation sampling with a control factor from dense poses."

The nearest vertices based weight can create a deformation problem.How that is not impacting?\n2. What if we only deal with offset of SMPL instead of fine stage? Geometrically Fig 6 (a) is not showing significant advantage.\n3. Its not clear why densepose is important than skeleton? Is it because skeleton is noisy? it is not clear from Fig 6(b) why the control net is behaving well with densepose. The argument is not strong. Cant there be other cases where densepose is failing?\n4. We need more example and grounding for the need of dual space training.\n5. How \"p\" is used in equation 4?\n6.What is the comparison between CFG and CFG rescale trick?\n7. Why Avatarverse has produced red belt instead of black belt in second row of Fig 3? has the comparison being done with proper negative prompt too?\n8.It is not clear how the method is handing the janus problem."

In addition, the authors propose to perform SDS sampling with a diffusion model conditioned on DensePose, which allows for better view consitency.

Experiments show that it can achieves precise and stable pose control, which may inspire future work on avatar generation or other catogery-specific 3D generation tasks. \n\n* The paper is well-writen and easy to follow."

In Figure 6(b), the authors conduct an ablation study to evaluate the effects of different SDS supervision, but the results only show that leveraging skeleton-based ControlNet may suffer from leg pose error. Existing methods like DreamHuman and DreamAvatar are typically based on original Stable Diffusion or skeleton-based ControlNet, and I didn't notice any view inconsistency issues. \n\n* Generating 3D models in a coarse-to-fine manner with two representations is not a new idea. In fact, it has already been proposed in ProlificDreamer [Wang et al, 2023], which also leverage NeRF for initialization and uses DMTet for further refinement. Therefore, I don't think it can be regarded as a technical contribution. \n\n* Jointly optimizing the textured avatar mesh in both deformed and canonical spaces is also not new and has been proposed in DreamAvatar, which also proposes to perform SDS supervision in both canonical space and posed space.  \n\n* Overall, although this paper demonstrates good results, its technical novelty is not strong enough to me. I feel that the proposed method is more like a combination of existing techniques and tricks."
