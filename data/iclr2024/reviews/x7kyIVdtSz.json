                "value": "This paper introduces a partially-parallelized Transformer model called the Strided Transformer. Unlike traditional autoregressive Transformers, which require a token to be fully predicted before predicting the next token, the Strided Transformer feeds the predicted token simultaneously to several subsequent steps and inserts it into different layers. In this way, strided Transformer supports parrallel computation of different time steps during decoding, which accelerate the decoding and reduces the memory load."

There is a lack of discussion and comparison with related work, such as non-autoregressive [1] or semi-autoregressive [2] sequence generation approaches.\n3. The authors report only the theoretical decoding speedup, without evaluating its performance in a real-world environment.\n4. Reporting test losses on WMT benchmarks is not a standard practice. Please implement greedy or beam search and provide the corresponding BLEU scores for a more meaningful evaluation. \n\n\n[1] Gu, Jiatao, et al. \"Non-autoregressive neural machine translation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.02281 (2017).\n\n[2] Wang, Chunqi, Ji Zhang, and Haiqing Chen. \"Semi-autoregressive neural machine translation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.08583 (2018)."
