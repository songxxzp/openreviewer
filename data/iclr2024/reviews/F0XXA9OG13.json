                "value": "This work proposes an approach for developing learning prediction models using heterogenous tabular data sources and schemas and across tasks. The approach relies on large language models to represent structured data in natural language as a common representation across contexts, aggregate datasets from like and unlike tasks and populations, and do zero and few-shot prediction. The approach is applied to several medical data (primarily clinical trials with some retrospective observational data). The approach generally outperforms fully-supervised baselines and further performs well in zero and few-shot settings."

Are they used as supplementary databases during the psuedolabeling step? \n* How is the MIMIC-IV data processed? The information in Table 1 that shows that there are only 2 categorical, 1 binary, and 1 numerical feature in MIMIC-IV. As MIMIC-IV is much richer (potentially thousands of features) it is unclear which components of the database are actually used and no details are provided.\n* In section 2.4, why is the initial model trained on all available training data from $T_1$ considered a multi-task model (designated by $f_{MTL}$)? If I understand correctly, this model is trained on one task, but several datasets.\n* The description of the psuedolabeling step is not entirely clear to me. Is the idea to take the initial model for the target task, make predictions for the target task on data collected for other tasks, and then use those predictions as pseudo-labels for further training? This seems peculiar because it is not clear that this should fundamentally improve performance for the target task given that the pseudo-labels are essentially just predictions of the target label derived from information in the target task database(s).\n* If available, it would be relevant to compare to baselines that pool over datasets with rule-based schema harmonization. For example, in the context of electronic health records and claims data, there are standards such as the OMOP Common Data Model that provide the means of mapping data from disparate sources to a shared schema.\n* An ablation experiment that removes the auditing steps (both the LLM sanity check and the Data Shapley checks) and the pseudolabeling step would help gain insight into the marginal value that they provide, especially as they are positioned as the novel methodological contributions of this work relative to TabLLM (if I understand correctly)."

                "value": "- The framework is quite straightforward, and there is not much technical contribution. It is mostly a combination of multiple existing models. And the idea of transferring tabular data into text is not novel at all. There are a bunch of existing works [1][2][3], including one of their baselines TabLLM[4]. The further incorporation of text information from samples from other datasets is just one trivial step forward. Furthermore, [4] actually proved that a template for transferring the tabular data works better than an LLM. Yet, in this paper, there is no comparison for such serialization methods.\n\n- The author didn\u2019t specify what exact features are included in these experimental datasets. Also, it is unclear how many columns are overlapped between different datasets. Yet, if there is a large portion of feature overlapping, maybe simple concatenation and removing or recoding of the missing columns will work just as well. There is no discussion regarding this whatsoever.\n\n- The step 2 in section 2.2 is confusing:\n    - The authors claimed that they used active learning in step 2. Is the \u201cactive learning pipeline\u201d method the same as traditional active learning that select informative samples to label? If not, the description can mislead the readers.\n    - The authors claimed that they cleaned supplementary dataset T_{1, sup} with a data audit module based on data Shapley scores. More experiments are expected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the audit module. Moreover, it would be better if the authors conducted more ablation studies to show whether the supplementary dataset improve the prediction performance. \n\n- The datasets in Table 1 contain less than 3000 patients. It is very easy for the LLMs (e.g., BioBERT) to overfit the training set. It is unclear how the authors prevent overfitting during the fine-tuning phase.\n\n- In Table 3, the proposed MediTab exhibits the capability to access multiple datasets during its training, in contrast to the other baseline models, which are constrained to employing a single dataset. This discrepancy in data utilization introduces an element of unfairness in the comparison. It would be more appropriate to conduct a comparison against models that have undergone training on multiple datasets. For instance, TabLLM, being a large language model, can readily undertake multi-dataset training with minor adjustments to its data preprocessing procedures. Therefore, a more equitable comparison would involve evaluating MediTab and TabLLM under identical conditions, both in the context of training on a single dataset and across multiple datasets. \n\n- Most medical data, like MIMIC-IV, includes timestamp information of the patients\u2019 multiple visits or collections. This framework completely ignores this part of the medical data, which limits their application to real-world clinical environments.\n\nReference:\n1.
