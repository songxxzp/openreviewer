Both the actor and critic NNs are parameterized similarly. The agent is assumed to be optimizing an entropy regularized objective and optimized via minimizing a surrogate first variation. They employ a dual loop learning mechanism for the $Q$ function, within every policy improvement step. They show the soundness of their methodology:\n1. they show \"one step\" improvement of the inner loop of TD learning,\n2. convergence of the $Q$-function's estimate to the $Q$-function corresponding to the policy in that step\n3. convergence to globally optimal stationary distribution with bias dependent on the entropy regularization's weight.\n\nFinally, they demonstrate the efficacy of their proposed method in a toy environment."

As a reader I would be interested in appendix sections with various proofs and technical concepts. For more details see the minor issues listed below. Further, there is some lack of clarity when it comes to interpreting the various Lemmas and Theorems. There are some notational issues as well which make it harder for me to interpret the math and the results.\n2.  **Issues with feature learning in RL:** while the authors claim that the NN learns features they do not define it in context of RL. I understand that mean field parametrization is a feature learning regime as opposed to NTK but I dont see how it relates to RL? In section 5, the claim is that MFLTD performs better by reducing the Bellman error better than NTK-TD due to better feature learning but I am unclear how it would follow that feature learning helps achieve this. What contribution does feature learning make to agent performance or to minimizing the TD error? Further, this is only shown for the td-learning sub-loop (MFLTD) and not for the broader algorithm MFLPG. Any insight into how feature learning effects an RL agent's learning trajectory would be meaningful and go a long way in answering the primary question posed in the introduction.\n\n***Minor issues:***\n1. Agarwal et. al on top of page 3 is missing the year. \n2. Section 3.1 for Log-Sobolev inequality point to Appendix and please offer some explanation.\n3. Section 3.1: please cite previous work for the claim that regularization smoothens the problem\n4. \"is a standard Gaussian distribution simply.\" -> \"is a standard Gaussian distribution.\"\n5. Point to the proof of Proposition 1 in Appendix and also the related Appendix sub-section which contains the definition for First variation of Functionals.\n5. Section 3.1: cite for the connection between the Fokker Planck equation and the SDE.\n6. Algorithm 2 is referenced in algorithm 1 without any explanation, I would add one liner on how Algorithm 2 is for TD-learning.\n7. Definition 1 in Appendix B.1: What is $\\mathcal F$? It would be better defined or explained here.\n8. $t$ is overloaded across Equations 5,6 and Section 2. One is agent time and another is gradient time step.\n9. What do you mean by \"From an argument similar to $\\mathcal F$\" in section 3.2?\n10. Term $s$ is overloaded for the expression of $dw_s$ for Section 3.2, used as both state and time.\n11. In the sentence with sample $(s, a, s', a')$ is introduced without explanation, where are these samples used? In the estimation of the loss in Equation (7)?\n12. Equation (25) from Appendix referenced in the main body in Section 4 and this seems like a leap. \n13. $S$ as run-time is overloaded in Section 4.\n14. Lemma 1: what is the difference between $\\varsigma$ and $\\varsigma_{\\pi}$?\n15. In various locations $Q_{\\pi}$ and $Q_q$ are used which is ambiguous notation because $\\pi$ is policy and $q$ is the initialization distribution of the NN.\n16. Theorem 1: $s$ is overloaded.\n17. Section 4: \"takes advantage of the data-dependent advantage of neural networks\" reads like it might be wrong.\n18. It might be helpful to define the Radon-Nikodym Derivative in the Appendix.\n19.

                "value": "This paper considers the mean-field neural actor-critic algorithm for deep reinforcement learning. Both policy and Q-function are parametrized by a two-layer neural network. With appropriate assumptions, the authors conduct analysis in the mean-field limit region. The main contributions in this paper are\n1. Authors introduce a mean-field Langevin TD learning algorithm for the critic update. It is a double-looped algorithm, and specifically the inner loop is based on the gradient descent of the regularized loss function discussed in Nitanda et al., 2022 and Chizat, 2022.  For the discrete time analysis, the paper provides a time-averaged convergence rate $O(1/T)$.\n2. Authors introduce a mean-field Langevin policy gradient algorithm for the actor update. From the continuous-time perspective, the paper provides the guarantee of global optimality and a linear convergence rate."

Moreover, the authors claim that the paper gives the first global optimality result of the stationary point of the MFLPG using a one-point convexity method. Numerically the paper shows that it outperforms NTK and single loop TD algorithm by achieving lower mean squared Bellman errors."

                "value": "1. The writing of this paper is very dense and the text arrangement makes it not easy to track definitions and theorems. I suggest that all equations in the main text should be labeled, and for notations in the appendix, authors should try to make an enumerated list to summarize all definitions of $\\tilde{f}$, $\\tilde{\\rho_t}$, $\\hat{\\rho_t}$, $Q^{(l)}$, $Q_{\\pi}$, $q_s$, $q^{(l)}$, $\\cdots$ to assist reading. \n\n2. The paper does not show how the actor and critic updates are combined together. A unified analysis for the combined algorithm would also be useful. However, I cannot find the combined algorithm anywhere in this paper. \n\n3. The discrete time analysis of MFLPG, unlike MFLTD, is missing. \n\n4. Many parts of the proof are unclear to me, I will explain them in details in the Questions section.\n\n5. The technique used to show linear convergence of inner loop MFLD does not seem to be new compared to previous established works."

On page 16, in C.1, (12), where is $\\frac{\\lambda_{TD}}{2}\\mathbb{E}(||\\omega||^2) +Z$ ?. Also, $s\\in [0,T_{TD}] $ should be $l\\in[0,T_{TD}]$.\n\n3. On page 16, $\\mathbb{E}[(Q^{(l)}-\\mathcal{T}Q^{(l)})(Q^{(l+1)}-Q_\\pi)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\Delta Q^{(l+1)}(I-\\gamma \\mathcal{P})\\Delta Q^{(l)}]$, can you give a detailed derivation?\n\n4. On page 18, ``using the strong convexity of $L_l$\", can you explain or add a reference to it?\n\n\n5. On page 19, the explanation of $D_{KL}(q_0||\\nu)=0$ is missing.\n\n6. On page 21, the expression of $J[\\rho]$ is different from the one on page 3, can you add details to explain why they are the same?\n\n7. On page 22, $g_t[\\rho_t]$ does not look like the one defined on page 5, (5). A derivation for that equivalence is missing.\n\n8. On page 22, (31), I don't see how the last inequality holds. In 1D, it means that $2ab\\geq a^2-b^2$, how could it be true?\n\nIn the main text,\n\n9. On page 4, $\\mathcal{S}\\times \\mathcal{A}\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ does not look correct.\n\n10. Assumption 2 needs a further verification. What do you mean by \"$R$ is the boundary of neural networks Q-function estimator\"? Or say ``neural network radius\" mentioned on page 20? I suggest that giving a simple example and computation would make this assumption more convincing."
