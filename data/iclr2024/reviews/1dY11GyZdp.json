The key idea is performing local binarization of network weights, which results in global ternarization. This exploits the repetition-sparsity tradeoff to improve efficiency during inference. The method uses two distinct quantization functions and alternates between them locally within the network filters."

                "value": "1. The paper conveys confusing messages on several basic concepts.\n    * About weight \u201crepetition\u201d in BNNs (Section 2 last paragraph). The efficiency of BNNs does not mainly come from the \u201crepetition\u201d of 1-bit filters so that redundant memory access can be reduced. It comes from the reduction in bitwidth compared to high-precision floating-point numbers so that more efficient matmuls can be applied. The motivation of the paper is therefore ill-posed.\n    * Questionable claim in Section 3: \u201cBinary models aim for efficiency by maximizing weight repetition\u201d. There are no specific constraints or regularizations on the objective function to make a binarized CNN optimized for repeating its filters. The paper needs to provide evidence to show that BNNs are intentionally learning repetitive weights.\n\n2. The goal of improving the repetition-sparsity trade-off is questionable. Repetition and sparsity do not seem to be a trade-off, i.e., improving one doesn\u2019t compromise the other. For example, in the context of the paper, a model with zero weights is extremely sparse and in the meantime has extremely repetitive filters.\n\n3. The method described in Section 4 seems to be incomplete. It uses {-1, 0} binarization for some weight tiles and {0, +1} binarization for the others. This means that on hardware, 0 and 1 will correspond to different values for different tiles. What will be the overhead when accumulating the output of those tiles? The paper needs to provide an analysis.\n\n4. There are limited baseline methods. The paper claims it pushes the Pareto frontier, but in Figure 4 it does not compare to the recent advancements in BNNs, e.g., [1], [2], etc.\n    * [1] N.

By enforcing this additional constraint the method achieves locally binary quantization within a region, by allowing values to be either 0 or {-1, 1}, but globally ternary across the entire filter. The result is that within a constrained region values are binarized as well and highly sparsified which reduces the amount of data that must be moved per layer to perform an inference pass. The authors show that this simple application does not greatly impact the accuracy of the resulting network but yields notable performance improvement."

For now the reader has to cross-reference the dot with the referenced works to make the comparisons concrete.\n- The performance results in Figure 6 clearly demonstrate the increased efficiency of the inference pass for the signed-binary networks compared to normal binary and ternary networks."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Major:\n- My only major concern is with respect to the novelty of the approach. I like the proposed method but it seems to overlap in many ways with previous work, used for instance in post-training quantization methods, to decompose a set of parameters into non-overlapping regions and using a fixed number of values per region. I think of this work as being an extension of that idea where the set of values per region is constrained to come from a very restricted set.\n\nMinor:\n- Figure 1 should be expanded upon to include more valuable information or be removed altogether. As it is I don't think it provides a lot of value to the text. \n- The proposed method requires retraining from scratch to learn the binarized filters (this was mentioned as a limitation in the text).\n- The text does not flow very well in several places in the text and needs a few more passes over the text to clean up awkward sentences.\n- Most of the text in the first paragraph of section 5.1 seems to be repeating the same idea regarding effectual and ineffectual values. It's not clear to me that a distinction between effectual and ineffectual parameters vs multiplications necessitates redundancy in the text. \n- Though the terminology of \"effectual\" and \"ineffectual\" seem to be inherited from prior work I can't say I'm a fan of it. It's not something worth debating but personally, it's not clear to me how much value I gain denoting zeros as \"ineffectual\".\n- Aesthetically speaking I do not care for the wrapped text around Figure 2 or the packed nature of Tables 1-5. Though the tables may fit well together there may be a better way to incorporate Figure 2 by sacrificing Figure 1."
