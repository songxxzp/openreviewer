                "value": "Major concerns:\n\n1. The amplitude shifting loss seems not optimal for noisy time series data, which is almost all time series of interest. The MSE loss aims to estimate the expectation of the probability distribution of the time series, which is the optimal solution, while the amplitude shifting loss always introduces a bias so that the prediction is always above or below of the noisy signal. \n\n2. Similar to question 1, in many cases, the amplitude shifting loss will compete against the standard MSE loss. For some problems, MSE loss will be optimal and, for the other cases, probably the amplitude shifting loss makes sense. However, how to decide which one to use?\n\n3. The Fourier loss makes a much more sense than the amplitude shifting loss. It will capture the periodicity of the time series data. Recently, it has been shown in many studies that capturing a periodicity is a key element in time series forecasting. However, the authors should elaborate how they compute the Fourier coefficients. For example, when if the signal is not periodic, the Fourier series do not converge, meaning it is difficult to truncate the Fourier series. So, deciding the dominant frequency is non-trivial. What's the theoretical reason to choose $\\sqrt{T'}$ to truncate the Fourier seires?\n\n4. The loss based on the auto-correlation also makes a sense. However, I don't fully understand the explanation of the weakness of the Fourier loss. The authors explained three reasons why the Fourier method fails to represent the characteristics of the time series. But all of the three reasons exactly apply the same for the auto-correlation function. As the authors explained, if the time series is non-stationary, the auto-correlation also keeps changing, like the Fourier series. As a matter of fact, auto-correlation and Fourier series are like two sides of a coin. \n\n5. What's the logic behind of the structure of the loss function in (7)? Why is $L_{phase}$ grouped with $L_{shift}$? And $L_{amp}$ is separate?\n\n6. It may be interesting to compare the results with DLinear (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13504.pdf), where they proposed a very simple linear model with trend and seasonality decomposition, which should be similar to the loss functions proposed."

Does regularizing \"non-dominant\" frequencies for noise robustness help in practice? How do you deal with the fact that time series are finite-length signals (and there could be boundary effects)?\n* How do you choose $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$? Why stop at three terms in the loss function? Did you empirically find these distortions to be most common in the datasets of interest? \n* It would have been valuable to carry out an analysis and see how common these distortions are in the datasets you evaluate on.
