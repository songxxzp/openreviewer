To do so, the authors formulate CFR\u2019s iteration process as an MDP and give a transformation that frames the (CFR) discount scheme as a policy optimization problem wherein the dynamic discounting scheme is an agent that interacts with the MDP. The primary motivation of this framework is to be able to learn discounting policies that can generalize over different IIGs, rather than having to be carefully designed for specific games. In this direction, the authors design a training algorithm based on evolution strategies that can generalize well, even to games that are not seen in the training process."

Moreover, the experiments prevented are convincing, showing not just benchmarking against current state of the art but also ablation studies which gives a stronger idea of what aspects of DDCFR makes the most improvement over standard CFR approaches. The DDCFR methodology is also shown to be effective in modifying other CFR variants, which is a useful property to have. Moreover, the paper is well written in the way that motivations are clear, and any potential concerns are discussed in fair detail (for instance, the discussion about the potential additional computational costs)."

My suggestion to the authors would be to highlight several key results in the table and provide a more substantiated explanation for each. It would also have been nice to see running time comparisons in the experiments to properly verify the authors\u2019 claims about additional computational costs not causing major increases in running time."

Admittedly the problem studied here is a challenging one and necessitates heavy notations, as well as a collection of specific terminologies in both AGT and RL. However, some concepts are not used (or at least used explicitly), causing the paper to appear to be overwhelmingly dense at a first read. Assuming that the paper is targeted at audience with a game theory background, perhaps it would make more sense to spend some time describing and motivating the key algorithmic contributions from the RL angle. For instance, it might be useful to defer the mathematically rigorous definitions of *information set reach probability* or *interval history reach probability* to the appendix, and keep in the main body only an intuitive description of these concepts, as the paper's key contribution lies in the MDP-based approach proposed later. This takes up space and takes attention away from more important concepts such as exploitability $e$ and \"realized\" exploitability $E$.\n2. On are related note, there are some overloaded notations that make the paper harder to parse. For instance, the letter $a$ refers both to the actions taken by the agents in the \"Game Theory\" part of the paper and the action taken by the learner in the \"Reinforcement Learning\" part of the paper.\n3. For the experiments, it would be nice if the authors could provide the wall-clock times for DDCFR. DCFR has an added benefit that the algorithm requires little computation complexity at each round (the discount rates are specified beforehand) and it would be a fairer comparison to consider the computational aspect as well. (I am convinced by the arguments in Section 3.4, but adding these results will better validate the claims in Section 3.4 empirically.)\n4. Theorem 1 requires the action space to be discretized, yet this is not stated explicitly (also see the following section for question on boundedness of $\\tau_t$.\n5. It appears that experiments are only run once, yet multiple runs are required to demonstrate that the proposed approach convincingly outperform DCFR, and the figures in the paper are not due to luck alone."

Will the algorithm still converge at the rate provided in Theorem 1?\n2. Purely out of curiosity, why should we directly \"jump\" to RL which, as the paper points out, \"notably sensitive to hyperparameters\". Does it make sense to consider a bandit-based approach for optimizing the discount rates?"
