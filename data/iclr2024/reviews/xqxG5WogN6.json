The authors first demonstrates how class distribution shifts degrade the performance of BNAdapt, a method that updates Batch Normalization statistics during test time. Particularly, the research found that as class imbalance increased, BNAdapt's performance worsened compared to a NoAdapt approach, which maintains the original training without any modification. The study also highlights consistent confusion patterns among classes during label distribution shifts. To mitigate performance degradation caused by these shifts, the research introduces a distribution shift-aware module that refines classifier predictions by adjusting for detected class distribution changes during test time.  In various benchmarks, DART consistently outperformed existing TTA methods, especially as class imbalance ratios increased"

However, compared to traditional TTA methods that cannot access labeled data, this approach may not be entirely fair. Test time adaptation, where the model learns directly during the testing phase, might be a more desirable direction.\n\n- The distribution-aware shift matrix for refinement has been frequently employed in handling label-noise datasets (Natarajan et al., 2013; Patrini et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2021). Although the authors argue that TTA and these tasks differ, TTA essentially involves adding noise to the original data. Therefore, the nature of the problem between TTA and handling label-noise is fundamentally similar. The authors need to further elucidate the methodological distinctions between their proposed approach and existing methods (Natarajan et al., 2013; Patrini et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2021). Additional considerations should also be clearly addressed."

What is the advantage of the proposed method over SAR? I found that the authors prepared the imbalanced ImageNet-C dataset following SAR. However, I failed to find the empirical comparisons between the proposed method and SAR.\n3.\tIn my understanding, the authors seek to train a distribution shift-aware module to generate a matrix for prediction refining. In this sense, the data to train such a module should be class-imbalanced. However, as mentioned in the paper, the dataset $D_{int}$ seems to be class-balanced.\n4.\tWhat is the computational cost to train a distribution shift-aware module in the \u201cintermediate time\u201d?
