                "value": "Despite the strengths, there are also some concerns.\n\n1. Although the adversary model (P) looks reasonable, it seems oversimplified in section 3. Specifically, after the simplification (I) and (ii) in section 3, the adversary vector is restricted to be colinear with the average of the true gradients. Moreover, considering that in the FOE attack (Xie et al., 2020), the adversary vector is $-\\epsilon$ times the average of the true gradients. Although I understand that the hyper-parameter $\\epsilon$ in FOE is a pre-fixed constant, while $\\lambda_t$ in JUMP is obtained by solving the optimization problem ($P_l$), the novelty of JUMP is limited due to the oversimplification. It seems that simplification (ii) is to simplify the optimization problem but greatly weakens the generalization of the proposed model. The reason why $a_t$ is restricted to be colinear with the average of true gradients is not well specified. I would greatly appreciate it if the authors could comment on this.\n\n2. The proposed attack requires much more information than existing attacks. Other than the clients' local gradients (or momentum) that are required in ALIE (Baruch et al., 2019) and FOE (Xie et al., 2020), the proposed attack JUMP also assumes that the adversary has access to the global honest loss $\\mathcal{L}_\\mathcal{H}(\\cdot)$ and the robust aggregation rule $F(\\cdot)$ on the server. The extra assumption needs to be specified. Moreover, could the proposed method JUMP deal with the case where there is randomness in the robust aggregation $F(\\cdot)$ and the aggregated result is not a deterministic value?\n\n3. JUMP seems to have a much higher computation cost than existing attacks such as ALIE and FOE. However, there is neither a theoretical analysis of the time complexity nor the experimental results of the running time in the main text."

Jump computes \\lambda at certain intervals, e.g., in each FL round or after each \\tau rounds. The paper shows how Jump attack can overshoot the good minima of a simple non-convex problem and force the model to a bad minima, while other attacks only slow down the convergence of model to the good local minima.

However I have multiple concerns about the current draft. \n\n- Shejwalkar & Houmansadr (2021) also use something similar to Jump\u2019s malicious gradient in (4); e.g., in equation (6) of Shejwalkar & Houmansadr (2021) attack, if we substitute \\eta_t = (1 - \\lambda_t) while p_t = -\\bar{g}^H_t we get the Jump attack. Given this I think authors should discuss the distinction between the two attacks more explicitly.\n- Experimental evaluation is on very small settings: total number of clients is 12 which is very small for the FL settings that are vulnerable  to model poisoning in practice [1]. This does not discount the utility  of the work, but authors should be clear in terms of the goals of the work and where it is useful, especially positioning it with the conclusions of [1] so that readers will understand  how to use this work.\n- Next, I think the experiments performed are not fair: Jump attack uses the knowledge of the robust aggregation but the attacks it is compared with are aggregation-agnostic attacks; authors should provide a fair comparison, i.e., compare with aggregation-tailored attacks of Shejwalkar & Houmansadr (2021).\n- I did not understand what is the solver used in the work and how it solved the Jump\u2019s objective; please add this to the main paper.\n- Experimental setup is an important part of conveying the utility of the work. Please check [3] for details and consider more practical settings, e.g., challenging datasets, more clients, etc.\n\n\n[1] Shejwalkar et al., Back to the Drawing Board: A Critical Evaluation of Poisoning Attacks on Production Federated Learning, IEEE S&P 2022\n[2] Fang et al., Local Model Poisoning Attacks to Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning, USENIX 2019\n[3] Khan et al., On the Pitfalls of Security Evaluation of Robust Federated Learning, IEEE S&P WSP 2023"

                "value": "The style and quality of the writing is to me a significant issue, as it makes it difficult to parse the authors intent at times (examples of some points of concern in the earlier sections are raised below). I also hold concerns relating to the nature of the contributions, and the claimed performance increases that the authors have achieved, especially as the level of outperformance drops in the results reported in the appendices. \n\nThe following is a set of general issues/questions I have with specific parts of the paper, as well as a commentary on areas where the issues regarding the writing style and lack of specificity in the written content cause interpretation issues (with particular focus placed upon the abstract and introduction).\n\nGeneral questions: \n- The concept of robust aggregation processes is to filter out likely adversaries. If all adversaries are equal, then detecting this cluster would likely be a trivial inclusion into robust aggregation. How would your work perform if you were unable to impose uniformity among the adversary update vectors?\n- How reasonable is the assumption regarding the model dimension? Obviously this is a worst-case assumption, but if the adversary only has access to the local information on the set of compromised agents, does this assumption hold in practice? If an attacker has enough information to know the updates of all agents (both compromised and uncompromised) then they've compromised the central update server, which you've assumed is secure. This seems like an inherent contradiction in the threat model. I will note though that I believe I have seen this in other byzantine works, so this may not be an issue specific to your work. \n- You note on page 5 that this approach works for any variant of robust D-SGD - but how do these modifications influence the performance of your technique?\n- Could you explain the segment length in additional detail? At the moment problem P_l implies that the attacker only acts every $\\tau$ steps - but this would appear to be contradicted by the loss subfigure from Figure 1. \n- One of the reasons that JUMP is claimed to work is that it can force trajectory jumps over global minima - however this would seem to be an observation that would be very sensitive to the largest allowable trajectory jumps, and yet this doesn't seem to be a property that has been explored. \n- How would your technique perform in the context of a) more agents, or b) when the number of agents is fixed, but the proportion of byzantine agents increased?\n- Why does Table 1 show results that are only positive for your technique, whereas the \"full numerical results\" from Appendix C2 reveal ranges of setups where your technique is outperformed. This feels as if the main body contents have been pruned to show your technique in the best possible light. Could you explain the choices of content included in Table 1 vs C2? \n\nAbstract:\n- \"consists in ensuring\" - generally the idiomatic follow on from \"consists\" would be of, but more broadly there's no need for consists within this sentence. \"Byzantine robustness in distributed learning ensures that distributed....\"\n- The first two sentences imply that there are other kinds of workers other than Byzantine workers, yet the idea of what a worker is or how they're involved in the process is not defined. \n- \"so far\" implies that they've been defined within this work, whereas \"to date\" more clearly contextualises this statement relative to historical work. \n- \"critical points\" - undefined and unspecified, relies on a familiarity with the field that the reader may not have. I'm assuming that this is convergence points of the learning process, however this isn't clear.\n- \"is a solution to a simplified form of the optimal adversary's problem, it is very powerful\" - what is the problem? A form in what way? What is powerful a measure of? This sentence doesn't have the contextual scaffolding for anyone to understand it. Moreover the framing is so convoluted that it's impossible to parse intent and meaning here - the only interpretation that would make sense would be that the authors are trying to say that JUMP may be a solution to a simplified problem, but this problem has a high degree of transferability to more complex spaces.\n- \"even the greedy version\" - greedy in what context? What is the non-greedy version of JUMP?\n- While I'm not familiar with \"accuracy damage\" as a metric, the framing of a doubling being going from 66% to 50% vs 81% is again framed in a fashion where the impact of this work is impenetrable.\n\nIntroduction:\n- What is this new generation of models, relative to traditional machine learning? An introduction like this would imply the use of new architectures like Transformers, which I'm assuming aren't actually going to be present here. \n- Typically if you're going to introduce an acronym like DSGD, then that implies that the whole item is a proper noun, so then the in text version should be Distributed SGD or Distributed-SGD, rather than distributed SGD. \n- \"causes safety and reliability issues\" - these issues aren't guaranteed, but it can cause such issues. \n- In the framing of the introduction, it's not clear if Byzantine workers are malicious or benign (as in, if the manipulation has intent behind it), and if they're potentially collaborative. \n- \"consistently circumvents it to worse regions of the loss landscape, where it leverages data heterogeneity to converge to poor models\" The subject of the \"it\" is ambiguous; the involvement of data hereogeneity doesn't seem to add anything to the sentence; the idea of what a poor model is is vague and unspecified; and generally considering that this is an attack on a single, collaboratively derived model then it should be model singular rather than pluarl. \n- \"segment length that JUMP uses\" - what segment length? Unspecified and unclear. \n\nSection 2:\n- Eqn 2 contextualises H as the full set of weight updates. Equation P [also, why is this equation P?] introduces $i \\notin \\mathcal{H}$ - but by this definition, the elements $i \\notin \\mathcal{H}$ aren't incorporated into the algorithm at all. \n\nSection 4 and appendices:\n- The blue/red vectors on the dense blue/green contours are quite difficult to parse visually - a problem that is even worse in the figures contained within the appendices.\n\nSection 5:\n- In table 1 it's only implicit that this is referring to accuracy, and accuracy is not even mentioned until 4 lines into the table caption, which is certainly a choice. \n- Table talks about heterogeneity - which ahs been unspecified up to this point (there are 5 prior references on pages 1 and 2, and all of these prior references are incredibly abstract. This issue stems from the positioning of Table 1, and how it preceeds the content that is used to describe it. It's very easy to read table 1 as a part of the 'key reasons of jump superiority\" subsection.\n- Table 1 doesn't include detail over the number of experiments that were used to capture the standard deviation (or range, who knows, because these details aren't specified). [See issue above re: positioning]\n- Table isn't contextualised in terms of how much agents are being used in total. [See issue above]\n- For the above 3 dot points, the minimum information required to interpret a table really should be included in the table caption. \n- \"Powerful\" is ambiguous, and being \"significantly more powerful\" or \"comprable\" is ambiguous. It is possible to perform a hypothesis test to calculate the likelihood that JUMP produces a stronger deleterious impact upon the accuracy than the other experiments - this would be far more meaningful than the current framing. \n\nAppendix C-2, Table 6 - if you're going to ommitt all other compairsons, NaN as your superiority metric could probably just be replaced with a dash as well."

The computation complexity also increases *linearly* with the number of honest clients and segment length. \n- Based on the two aforementioned reasons, though the proposed JUMP attack demonstrates high attack effectiveness, I doubt whether the improvement is meaningful given the unrealistic assumptions and restrictions: have access to data of all honest clients, have knowledge of Byzantine defenses, and high computation cost."

The Byzantine attack and defense problem in distributed learning has been studied extensively in recent years and there are many variants of this problem (e.g., by allowing the server to have an auxiliary dataset to boost trust [R1]). This paper remains focused on the most basic and standard problem setting, hence the novelty of this paper is limited in this sense.  \n\n[R1] X. Cao, M. Fang, J. Liu, and N. Gong, FLTrust: Byzantine-robust Federated Learning via Trust Bootstrapping, in Proc. NDSS 2021.\n\n2. This paper simplifies the problem by restricting the solution space to rank-1 vectors that are co-linear with the average of honest workers. Although this idea is interesting, this paper missed many ideas and methods developed in recent years, e.g., by treating the original attack problem as a bilevel optimization problem and employing more sophisticated bilevel optimization algorithms. It remains unclear how well the simplified strategy in this paper will perform when compared to these methods. Also, how about other simplified and restricted solution spaces, e.g., rank-2, rank-3, etc.?\n\n3. Although the authors conducted extensive numerical studies, most of the experiments were conducted on CNN with MNIST and CIFAR-10, which is now considered relatively easy datasets. Also, the authors only compared MinMax and MinSum in the adaptive attack category. The authors should conduct more experiments with other adaptive attack schemes.\n\n4. Also related to the previous bullet, the solution quality of the Jump method clearly depends on the nonlinear optimization solver. The authors only used Powell's method. This paper can benefit from testing and comparing more nonlinear solvers, and analyzing the impact of different nonlinear solvers on the proposed Jump method."
