While existing work (Nguyen et al. 2022) have shown the benefit of using pre-trained models in FL, they still require significant number of communication rounds between clients and server to reach good accuracy. At the same time, centralized fine-tuning methods (model soup, DiWA) cannot be easily extended to the federated setting due to their significant computational cost. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose Local Superior Soups (LSS), an efficient and local model interpolation-based method. LSS consists of three main innovations - a random interpolation method to speed up the model selection step, a loss term encouraging the models in the model pool to be more diverse and a loss term penalizing the distance of the candidate models to the initial model (affinity). Experimental results are provided on FMNIST, CIFAR10, Digit5 and DomainNet showing that the proposed LSS outperforms other heterogeneity tackling FL algorithms and also other weight/model averaging algorithms."

                "value": "* Section 3.2 seems to be mostly a rehash of existing work and can be significantly shortened I feel. For instance, the result in Theorem 1 has already been derived in [1] (see Table 1). A version of Proposition 3.1 has also been stated in Nguyen et al. 2022 (see Equation 3). Therefore I do not find any novelty in this section. There are also a few typos which complicate reading. For instance, it should be $f$ and not $f_i$ in the definition of $\\zeta$. The authors also write that \"there is an additional error term in the convergence rate that monotonically increases with the number of local steps (see the 3rd term of the RHS of Eq. 2)\". I don't quite understand this. The 3rd term has a $\\tau^{-1/3}$ and therefore it should decrease as $\\tau$ increases right? The authors main message is that there is a limited gain we can get by increasing the number of local steps, which is fairly intuitive and does not need such a lengthy explanation.  \n\n* The paragraph explaining why connected low-loss valley +pre-trained initialization can achieve extreme communication rounds reduction is purely based on hypothesis with no empirical/theoretical evidence. It would be good to verify that some of conclusions drawn in that paragraph (smaller $d$, lower $\\beta$, smaller $\\zeta$) hold empirically in practice. \n\n* The authors should add a separate algorithm environment for the RandomInterpolation subroutine that is called within the LSS Pseudo-code in Algorithm 1. Currently the Random Interpolation is only described in words, making it hard to understand exactly what the authors are doing. Also the authors make the claim that 'this integration ensures that the models selected for interpolation are inherently aligned within the same low-loss valley'. Why is this the case? What is special about the random interpolation that ensures that selected models are well aligned? Also is there anything specific to FL for the random interpolation or can it be applied to the centralized setting? If so, the authors should highlight this as I believe reducing the computation cost of model soup methods is a concern in the centralized setting as well.\n\n* Experimental results are mostly conducted on a small number of client ($M = 5$) which reduces the difficulty introduced by client heterogeneity in FL. Experimental results would be more convincing if they are conducted on more realistic FL settings, like those studied in Nguyen et al. 2022 with $M > 100$ clients and partial participation."

                "value": "* I was wondering if the authors have taken care to ensure a fair comparison between FedAvg and LSS. For instance, LSS involves clients training multiple local models which would entail a much higher computational cost than training just one local model. It would be good to add a figure/table comparing the computation cost of all the algorithms for some specific model/dataset.\n\n* Fixing the number of local steps to be 8 seems to be restrictive, especially considering that there are only $5$ clients, so each client will have around $10$k data-points. Have the authors actually verified that using more than $8$ steps leads to a decrease in performance?\n\n* Why is the performance of LSS so much better than other model-soup methods (second big row of results in Table 1 and Table 2)? Based on my understanding, these methods are performing a more sophisticated and computationally expensive model selection phase?\n\n* Please re-define the variable $i$ in Algorithm 1. Earlier $i$ was used to denote the index of the clients (Eq. (1)) which makes Algorithm 1 confusing at first glance. There is also a typo in the expression \"connecting preserving\" in Line 7 Algorithm 1. \n\n* In the first paragraph of Section 3, the words firstly, secondly and finally should not be capitalized.\n\n* It would be good to add the performance of all FL baselines (such as MOON, FedProx, FedBN, FedFomo, FedBABU) for the results in Figure 3, in order to make a stronger claim on reducing the number of communication rounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Woodworth, Blake E., Kumar Kshitij Patel, and Nati Srebro. \"Minibatch vs local sgd for heterogeneous distributed learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 6281-6292."

This interpolated model tends to be more stable, thereby enhancing its generalizability when integrated into FedAVG. For local training, two cost functions are also proposed, aimed at enhancing model diversity and affinity. These facilitate a more effective interpolation process and generally contribute to building a superior global model. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm."

However, this seems never really referred to or validated in the rest of the paper. \n\n- There are also several places unclear to me also in the theory part. For example, the authors claim \"there is an additional error term in the convergence rate that monotonically increases with the number of local steps\", which refers to the 3rd term of RHS. However, isn't the $\\tau$ in the denominator?\n\nAnd the main motivation of the model averaging is the authors claim the $\\beta$, which is the Lipschitz constant, will be controlled by LSS. However, I do not see any validation of such connection except for some intuition-based argument. Thus, whether the logic can go through remains unclear to me.\n\n- Based on my understanding, LSS replaces the multiple runs in model soups, which require several different hyperparameter specifications, with an iterative model averaging, i.e., average models continuously along with the optimization path. Basically, similarly to SWA? Currently the presentation of random interpolation is a bit confusing due to overcomplicated description.\n\n- About the experimental setup, the authors describe using different local update steps for different approaches. I am not very clear about the reasoning. Is there any figure or table showing FedAvg cannot take more local steps? And how to ensure a fair comparison in this different local update regime."
