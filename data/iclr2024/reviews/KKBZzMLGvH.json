Multi-Agent Decision Making Systems choose actions for multiple actors working together towards a shared goal. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a competitive approach for optimizing Decision Making Systems in the multi-agent settings\"  These are three independent sentences.  This part should be re-written.  In addition, a period is missing.  Also, this sentence \"We propose the usage of Bayesian Optimization (BO)\" is somewhat unnatural.  Please revise it.  There are other cases, but I would not enumerate all of them.  Please revise an article carefully.\n* Figures are too small and legends are overlapped with graphs; please see Figures 4 and 5.\n* Theoretical results heavily rely on the previous work, in particular (Srinivas et al., 2010).\n* I would like to ask about the results in Figure 5.  First off, why do BO results only show current maxima until a particular iteration, i.e., monotonically increasing?  Why are the other results fluctuated?  Also, why do the results at initial iterations differ across algorithms?  It seems unfair to the baseline methods.  Moreover, some baseline methods are better than the proposed methods.  These results seem reasonable.  Why do the authors use Bayesian optimization instead of reinforcement learning in these problems?"
