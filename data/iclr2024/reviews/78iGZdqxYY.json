Compared with existing graph distillation algorithms, MIRAGE shows advantages in key indicators such as prediction accuracy, distillation efficiency, and data compression rate. Furthermore, MIRAGE only relies on CPU operations, providing a more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient graph distillation method."

It is pointed out that existing distillation methods typically rely on model-related information and need to train on the full dataset, resulting in poor generalization and efficiency issues, respectively. To address these weaknesses, MIRAGE directly compresses the computation trees to synthesize datasets by mining sets of frequently co-occurring items. This is inspired by the observation that the distribution of the computation trees, formed by decomposing graphs based message-passing GNN frameworks, always exhibits high skewness. Therefore, it is possible to approximate the true graph representation by aggregating the root representations of only the highly frequent trees. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates the superiority of MIRAGE."

To provide a clearer argument regarding the necessity of full dataset training for existing methods and the distinct advantages of MIRAGE, we should consider the following: What is the comparative performance of existing distillation methods (e.g., gradient matching) when applied to both randomly initialized and well-trained models? Is there a substantial performance gap between the two scenarios? Regarding computational costs in the distillation process, it's worth examining the resource requirements for calculating the computation tree frequency distribution, particularly in the context of deep GNNs. How does this computational overhead compare to training models on the full dataset?  \n- (b) Technical Motivation: While the concept of the computation tree is inherent to GNNs, we should address the sufficiency of the frequency distribution for the computation tree. Key points to explore include: Why is maintaining a high computation tree frequency distribution sufficient for effective learning? What is the distribution pattern of the computation tree, and does it exhibit a long-tail distribution?\n\n2. Objectives: Ideally, the distillate data should mirror the distribution of the full dataset, implying that the gradients of the distillate data should align with those of the full dataset for any model (random or well-trained). It's essential to clarify that while distillation can reduce computation costs, the primary objective remains data distillation. Additionally, considering the architecture transferability for existing graph distillation methods, the advantage of model-agnostic techniques is not significant.\n\n3. Experiments: \n- (a) Comprehensive Model Comparison: In evaluating baselines, it would be beneficial to perform a comprehensive comparison across various model architectures. Specifically, assessing performance across different architecture pairs would enhance the evaluation's robustness and provide insights into transferability.\n\n- (b) Baselines and Model Initialization: Investigate the significance of GNN model training prior to distillation for baselines. Explore performance outcomes for well-trained, randomly initialized, and warm-up trained models. Understanding the effectiveness of random initialization can help determine the necessity of training on the full data for baseline methods.\n\n- (c) Hyperparameter Investigation: Explore the impact of different hyperparameters, such as threshold values and the number of hops, on various metrics, including accuracy, efficiency, compression ratio, and transferability.\n\n- (d) Trade-off Analysis: Provide insights into the trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and compression ratio. Understanding these trade-offs can offer valuable guidance for practical applications.\n\nIn a nutshell, I am currently leaning toward weak rejection. I am looking forward to the authors\u2019 response.\n\n-------------------After rebuttal -------------------------\nThanks for the response. I increase my score to 6."
