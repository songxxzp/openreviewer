They propose to use the distribution of returns of policies with random weights to evaluate an observation space by examining the right tail of the distribution. This has the significant advantage over the more naive approach of training multiple agents that it only requires evaluation and so observation spaces can be constructed with fewer environment samples. The authors combine examining the right tail of the return distribution with hill-climbing to automatically find good observation spaces.\n\nThey conduct experiments on paddle and traffic signalling as well as a motivating example on pybullet environments."

In Figure 1, the line with no ablation (in blue) seems to me to pretty much on par with the other approaches, with leaving out features making little difference, if any. \n\nAgain, in the Paddle experiment, having all of the features gives the best result in one of the scenarios, and clearly has a lower return than leaving out the x- and y-position of the ball, but the error bars are large. It is also not clear to me why leaving out the x- and y-position of the ball would be beneficial in this environment. It seems very counter-intuitive for the performance of the agent to improve by not knowing where the ball is -- the only reason I can think of for this is that the position of the ball is not sufficiently stochastic to be required, but then that suggests a problem with the environment, rather than genuinely discovering a feature that should be left out.\n\nPerhaps the most convincing case for this problem is made by the traffic signal results, but there the gains also seem marginal.\n\nAnother issue is that the authors only seem to cover environments with a small number of features. It is not clear to me that their approach obviously scales to environments with a large number of features.\n\nFinally, a small issue is that this approach only works for hand-engineered observation spaces and not large-dimensional observation spaces such as image-based ones."

It initialises with a certain observation space and then generates and evaluates neighbours of the observation space until no improvement is achieved over the current observation space (Hill Climbing). It uses a t-test to determine if a neighbour is statistically significantly better than the current observation space. It shows the usefulness of random policy rollouts for determining well-performing observation spaces for the PPO algorithm on some PyBullet environments. The paper evaluates the proposed approach on a paddle game similar to Pong and a Traffic Signal Control (TSC) environment where 7 out of 21 traffic lights are controlled with an observation space of up to 5 features."

The experiments done seem fairly cheap (though neither the amount of compute used nor the infrastructure used is provided as far as I can see), so I do not know why the main experiments were done on only two small environments.\nRegarding there being no other baselines, one simple baseline to compare against could be to train an RL agent for some time with a subset of features and see how it performs. I would not be surprised if this baseline were cheap as well. In random policies, a lot of compute is wasted on bad random policies. Without a comparison of compute used in both kinds of approaches, we cannot really judge if this method is actually cheap.\nI also did not understand why other types or kinds of features were not used during the evaluation. Using just two examples with five features each is not very convincing for me. Neither is the performance gained so clear. In fig. 4b for example, the confidence bars are so large that it is hard to trust the results.\nIt is also not clear how one would avoid local optima in nearest neighbour hill-climbing approach proposed. This would easily break down probably in even simple environments in my opinion.\nHow was the hyperparameter of the percentage of the right tail distribution used to evaluate the random policies chosen? This could easily be chosen to get better results for the approach and is important to know.\nFor the Traffic Signal Control experiments, why are their convolutional layers used (see Table 7, Appendix) when the agent state seems to be feature-based?\n\n**Writing**:\nSeveral important details seem to be missing from the paper.\nWhat is the reward sturcture of the Paddle environment?\nHow are the actions in section 3.2 chosen in the case of an over-/under-defined feature space? (for the \"normal\" feature space of 2 features it is clear how the signs lead to 4 actions, but not for the other feature spaces).\nEven though section 3.1 is about theoretical analysis, I do not see much theory there. It feels more like using a narrow and rhetorical example to motivate the approach.\nThe RL agent trained in section 4.2 is not mentioned in the main paper."

However, Figure 4a) shows clearly that, out of the four spaces considered, \u201c00111\u201d is the worst possible space. The default space \u201c11111\u201d as well as the two other spaces found with HC \u201c11010\u201d & \u201c10001\u201d both outperform the supposedly best space.\n\nFor the hard scenario, the table and Figure 4b) are mismatched as the \u201cbest space\u201d \u201c11011\u201d does not appear in the table. The two best spaces suggested by HC \u201c00111\u201d and \u201c10011\u201d both are accounted for in the plot and both perform much worse than \u201c11011\u201d, which does not appear in the table.\n\nThese results strongly suggest to me that HC is not a good candidate for selecting the observation spaces as in both scenarios, it did not suggest the best space reliably (or at all).\n\nFurther, the experimental setup in 4.2 makes me wonder why the proposed method was able to propose a pruned space that performed better than the original observation space with 5 features. Many details are missing here, such as how many HC runs were performed (this is important since you pointed out that HC strongly depends on the initialization) and how was the final space selected? How were the other hyperparameters for your method set? Why is it crucial to apply a right tail filter of top 5% here, whereas you previously used 15% for the experiment in section 3.2?\n\nOne big drawback of the method, which is not addressed in the work, is that the decoupling of the observation space selection completely ignores the learning dynamics of an RL agent. I believe that the method does not perform as well as it could, as it abstracts away any learning of an RL agent and thus might not see that certain features are important for learning at different stages of an agent\u2019s life cycle.\n\nLastly, the work often highlights the importance of observation space design without the need for expensive training as this would be prohibitive in real-world scenarios. While I appreciate the sentiment, I do not see how random policies are more beneficial in this case. Take for example the TLC scenario. In this scenario the observation space selection was only possible because of a simulator. Application to real-world would still not be possible as you would not want to first run 500 random policies on your traffic lights to figure out which features are relevant. Thus, I feel the work is not well aligned with real-world applications. In particular, I wonder if the observation space design algorithm presented here might overfit to the simulation environment and abstract away important features that would make a policy transferrable from simulation to a real environment.\n\nOverall, while I believe this is an interesting work, addressing an important challenge in RL, I do not think that the work is ready for publication."
