This paper presents the idea of ***Fusion of Experts (FoE)***, aiming to combine the strengths of multiple models with complementary expertise to push their collective generalization capabilities. The main contribution of the paper is to formulate the FoE problem as an instance of supervised learning, which is applicable to both discriminative and generative use cases. In addition, an extended ***FrugalFoE*** has been proposed to allow efficient expert fusion while only evaluating a subset of experts at test time.\nExtensive experimental evaluations on a wide range of tasks demonstrate that the proposed fusion method significantly improves the performance of individual experts."

However, they do not assume that there is additional validation data to access. If there is available validation data, can we train a parameterized fuser for traditional methods? Therefore, this is not fair in a sense, or can I understand that this is a setup for a new fusion task?\n\nOther concerns are as follows.\n- In the experimental section, the authors observed that \"using a single expert was almost as good as using all experts\" on different types of tasks. Could this possibly be the result of an illogical experimental setup? It looks like the knowledge between multiple experts is not complementary but redundant.\n- In Table 3, what is the difference between CNN DM Expert (higher part) and CNN DM Expert only (lower part)?

This approach reduces the number of experts being ran.\n\nThe experimental section is solid and shows the validity of the approach in various settings, ranging from classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, QA and text generation. Models like ResNet-18 and a wide plethora of LLMs (~7B params) are used, making this evaluation relevant in the state-of-the-art."

As far as I understand, to obtain the optimal (argmin), we must execute all the experts individually (in Eq. 4.3) and all the subsets in $\\mathcal{F}\\backslash\\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}$ for Eq. 4.4. This sounds quite intensive, and definitely more intensive than just running $\\mathcal{S}$ experts once. I know there is something I am missing here, I kindly ask the authors to bring some clarity in this sense. \n\n* Why is the cost term in Equation 4.1 summed over $f_k\\in \\mathcal{S}$? I would have expected this sum to be over $f_k\\in \\tilde{\\mathcal{S}}$, otherwise the term becomes constant wrt. the queried experts, right?\n\n* How can we use $c_k$ in practice? Can we use it to model aspects like energy consumption (for running an expert), flops, etc.? \n\n* Can the authors comment on Figure 2? Why is FrugalML performing so poorly? Even much worse than randomly picking the experts? \n  * Additionally, it would be interesting to add std bars for the Random Experts (selecting different random subsets of them, specially at lower values of the x axis).\n\n* In Section 5.2, the authors claim `Though sentiment analysis is essentially a classification task, we train the fuser using the generative model strategy 3.3`. I believe this is a typo and should be \"using the classification model strategy\".\n\n* I enjoyed the discussion in Section 3.3.\n\n* Conversely, I found Section 4.3 (graph) somehow disconnected and not adding to the work. Unless graphs are used in practice in the code (did not check).\n\n* Minor notation consistency comment. The set $\\mathcal{S}$ is not defined when it first appears. Furthermore, one can find both  $k\\in\\mathcal{S}$ and $f_k\\in\\mathcal{S}$ in the manuscript, which complicates readability."

In the discriminative case, we feed the input example to different individual models, take model outputs as the inputs to the fuser network, and train the fuser to predict the label of the input example. Similarly, in the generative case,  we feed the fuser network with individual model outputs and train the fuser to predict the best model index, which is obtained by feeding the labeled data to individual models and selecting the model that achieves the best performance. This prerequisite may not be realistic in practical scenarios, where there is no or only a few labeled data. If a large labeled dataset is available, it might be more efficient to fine-tune a foundational model or employ few-shot learning. A pivotal aspect of this research should be the generalization capabilities of the trained fuser across different tasks (e.g,. train the fuser on some tasks and test the fuser on unseen tasks), which would significantly enhance the paper's contribution.\n- The paper lacks an in-depth analysis of the fuser network. Although it is described as a lightweight MLP network, there's no exploration of how different architectures (e.g., simpler networks like linear models or more complex ones like transformers) might impact performance. Additionally, details on the training configurations, such as learning rate, epochs, dataset, and stopping criteria, are missing. The influence of the $K$ parameter in the $K$-NN component of the fuser network is also unclear. What is the rationale for choosing $K=9$?\n- The experiment sections lack in-depth descriptions (see questions).
