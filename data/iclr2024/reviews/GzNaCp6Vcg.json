The authors evaluate the design points from various types including experiments and initial and boundary conditions by computational constraint. They are then put together into the proposed PINN Adaptive Collocation and Experimental points selection, or PINNACLE, framework, which considers the interactions between the type of points selected. The authors theoretically demonstrate the relation of the framework to the generalization error, and the performance of PINNACLE compared to other design methods."

The work expressed the contribution and introduced the proposed framework clearly with illustrations that are quite helpful for understanding."

My understanding is that the constraints by initial conditions or boundary conditions are only considered as \"soft\" constraints here due to how the objective function is set up. I guess for most situations its impact on the results would not be significant, or in other words, the approximation is going to be quite good. However, I wonder whether there could be cases where even a minor violation of the limiting conditions will cause significant distruptions to the system, and if so, how the authors propose to tackle that.\n2. This follows my previous question. I see the limiting conditions are introduced as regularization components into the objective function, with the corresponding regularizer coefficients described as having a certain value. I wonder whether the authors have considered how to best place values on these regularizers according to the physical system, and whether that would have a substantial influence on the final result. I presume different limiting conditions will have varying impact on the system, so I am curious on whether the selection of coefficients may be incorporated into the framework."
