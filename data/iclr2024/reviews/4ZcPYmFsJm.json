The paper considers undesired concepts common in images like watermarks, QR codes, and text. The application of this method is useful in scenarios when a user wants to fine-tune a diffusion model on a private dataset that has a lot of undesired concepts like watermarks. To tackle this, problem the paper introduces Geom-Erasing, which has the following components: a concept detector/localizer, a text editing approach, and a mask-based fine-tuning objective. The experimental results show that the proposed method has significantly better performance than existing approaches."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The technical novelty of the proposed approach is limited. The improvement in concept erasure comes from text prompt editing and fine-tuning with the mask-based objective. The justification behind using the mask-based objective is not well supported. Specifically, it relies on the fact that the pre-trained model (SD) is not biased toward generated undesired concepts like watermarks. Therefore, when you relax the loss function on certain parts of the image it doesn't overfit on the fine-tuned dataset and lets the pre-trained model generate without constraints.  But what if the pre-trained model is biased (e.g., generates more watermarks) in itself? Will this model work? This can be tested by training on a separate watermark dataset, before fine-tuning on the desired downstream dataset. \n2. The claim of erasing \"implicit concepts\" is arguable. The current method heavily relies on an object detector that detects the exact position of an object like watermarks, texts, etc. I would assume concepts that would be implicit in an image are lighting conditions (sunny or cloudy), facial expressions (whether a person is angry or happy), etc. As it is hard to locate such features in an image it would be hard to extend the current approach for such applications. Given this, I feel the claims in this paper should be toned down to object erasure. \n3. The paper needs to present results using multiple diffusion models to thoroughly evaluate its efficacy. \n4. It would be interesting to see how the original ICR in the fine-tuned dataset affects the performance of Geom-erasing.\n\nMinor comments:\n\nSection 3.2: change \"We\" -> \"we\"\n\nSection 3.2: earlier on in the paper it is unclear how the watermarks are detected. It would be good have some of these details before presenting the method.\n\nLine before Eq. 3, what is l{., .}?"

This alignment ensures that these attributes correspond with the text conditions of the diffusion models. During testing, the model generates samples devoid of these undesired concepts by excluding the associated text inputs.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- In 3.1, the description of the latent space where the diffusion model is operated, appears ambiguous. The authors mention training the diffusion models within a VQ (quantized) space, traditionally recognized as a discrete domain. However, there's an indication that a Gaussian diffusion model is employed over this discrete space following the remaining statement of the paper. The methodology behind rounding continuous predictions to yield discrete outcomes remains unclear. If the latent space differs from being a VQ space, it's necessary that the description be revised, accompanied by detailing the construction of the latent space.\n\n- As the method embed the geometric information in a textual form, it is non-trival to explore deeper how well the text presents these geometric information. The visualization visualizes the attention map between the watermark and the image, but it does not show the correlation to the text embedding. Some additional may be benefitial to justify this point. For example, if we add \"watermark <another location>\" into the text, can the model move the watermark from the original place to another place? If so, it will provide better interpretation of the method and make the method more convincing. \n\n- The method is closely related to Dreambooth (Ruiz et al., 2023). The authors may need to carefully discuss the relation including connections and differences between this paper and the works related to Dreambooth. However, the discussion related to this point is not elaborated in the paper.\n\n- While the primary scope of the paper centers on the removal of implicit concepts with geometric attributes, it would be enriching to explore the method's efficacy in eliminating explicit concepts, such as objects. Alternatively, a discussion on the similarities and distinctions from prior works in this direction would provide valuable context and depth to the paper.\n\n- In the ablation study, the authors may also include the impact of the concept detecting to provide a study regarding the robustness of the proposed method.\n\n----------\n\n*Given the aforementioned concerns, my current inclination is to rate this submission below the acceptance threshold. However, I am open to reconsidering my evaluation if the authors address the highlighted issues or provide clarifications in their rebuttal.*"
