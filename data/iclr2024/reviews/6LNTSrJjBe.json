I'm curious about its \"learning curve\".\n- In Table 2 (right), what \"CoT+ReAct\" means?  In my understanding, ReAct is \"CoT\" in decision making problem.

The authors argue that \"we can conveniently backup to any state by setting the input...\" but, without an environment model, one needs to actually interact with the environment to roll out future steps in order to compute values for possible actions at an earlier step; see Fig-2 and 3. How is that possible in a real application that you could go back up to an earlier step after execution? More importantly, in deployment/inference, using future states of actual interactions does not seem to be a fair comparison with other model-free approaches such as ReAct which doesn't roll out, because it is like an undo move, right? \n\nSecond, presentation has major issues. It is easy-to-follow, which is good, but it leaves out much important information so I find it hard to gauge its overall soundness. \n\nE.g., the LATS section is confusing even to a reader familiar with both LLM and MCTS. This section needs a high-level review about MCTS and how it is reshaped with LLM for this framework. Important technical details need to be added: e.g., I didn't find any math formula about backpropagation even after checking within appendices and algorithm boxes."

How do you handle this question during the evaluation of value function in LATS?\n\n2. I understand that LATS leverages the final environment feedback to guide the MCTS search (especially in the backward process). The final result of programming and Webshop is accessible (since you have the simulator), but how can you get the feedback on HotpotQA? Will the HotpotQA environment tell you whether your answer is right or not? If so, it means that you are using a ground-truth answer during the MCTS search process which is completely not reasonable (tbh, this is also related to the phenomenon of using the correct answer as the criteria in my question 1). Could the author elaborate more on what the environment feedback looks like in the HotpotQA environment?\n\nReference\nHuang, Jie, et al. \"Large language models cannot self-correct reasoning yet.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.01798 (2023)."
