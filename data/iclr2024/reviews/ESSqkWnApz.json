The authors did not compare or discuss these works. And comparing one or two of them is important. \n2. Further, the proposed method might not be as new or unique as the authors suggest. It\u2019s important to note that TIMEDIFF is a diffusion model by replacing the U-Net architecture. The change of loss function and nosing step is straightforward by incorporating previous works (multinomial diffusion). \n3. The authors say that TIMEDIFF is faster because it takes less time to train than GAN-based methods. However, when we look at how fast generative models work, we usually look at how quickly they can create samples (**sampling procedure**), not how quickly they can be trained. Diffusion models, which TIMEDIFF is based on, usually create high-quality samples but take a long time to do so. So, saying that TIMEDIFF is more efficient than GANs in the introduction is misleading. The authors should instead focus on comparing the speed of creating samples. \n4 Privacy evaluation is necessary as existing works do, like membership inference attack. \n\n## Reference \n1.

Seeing the promise of diffusion models for other domains, both in terms of performance and optimized training, it is thus quite exciting to see a working solution that can adapt to the nuances of EHR. The authors have explicitly considered several nuances such as mixture of numerical/categorical data and missing values. \n- The performances on several benchmark datasets are quite promising, especially in terms of being able to mimic the real world datasets\n- The authors have tried to justify the importance of several sub components using ablation studies"

While noting the page limit, the description of diffusion processes and the key contribution could be improved upon\n- Some choices have not been explained in details. For example for the backbone network, the authors chose BiRNN. Were attention based models considered? \n- Also, the baselines, while many, should include a few of the more recent architectures (e.g. based on diffusion processes that granted may not address the categorical data well) and some classical ones e.g MedGaN"

Have the authors considered more advanced methods such as RNN/Attention models as modelers? In the same note, how was the data cohorted and the features selected for this task?"
