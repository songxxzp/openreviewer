A quick search reveals that same authors proposed other building blocks such as normalization using similar tools, please see \u201chttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13869.pdf\"\nIn 3.1, it is quite confusing why authors choose different notation to denote Grassmannian using different representations.\nThe authors should explain the abbreviation of the metrics on SPD like ai, le, lc used in section 3.1. For a general reader it will be easier to understand.\nAs FC layer can be treated as special case of convolution (with full kernel size), the authors should restructure the paper by defining convolution first, then the authors can just address FC trivially. \nIt is not clear why authors suddenly defining MLR in section 3.3 on positive semi-definite matrices. The MLR for SPD (and trivially can be extended to SPSD ) by using formulation in  Nguyen (2022a)\nWhat is the motivation behind using different metrics: \u201cWe use Affine-Invariant metrics for the convolutional layer and Log-Euclidean metrics for the MLR layer\u201d?\nWhat is rationale behind better performance using structure space representation as mentioned in \u201cThese results show that MLR is effective when being designed in structure spaces from a gyrovector space perspective.\u201d?
