This extension allows for more expressive and controlled image synthesis.

It seems to me that XTI also introduces extra parameters than TI. Please correct me if I misunderstood this part. While XTI outperforms TI consistently, dreambooth also outperforms XTI by a large margin. \n- Minor: there are quite a few related work out there for personalization, like break-a-scene, SuTI, Subject-Diffusion, and InstantBooth.
