                "value": "This paper aims to address the serious scalability problem of using the entire knowledge graph (KG) for inference. To this end, one-shot subgraph reasoning on large-scale KG is proposed. This method decouples the inference process into two steps, (i) extracting only one query-dependent subgraph and (ii) reasoning on this single subgraph. This method has higher training efficiency and stronger reasoning ability."

For example, in section 3, the first paragraph states, 'The design principle here is to first identify one subgraph, which is relevant to a given query and is much smaller than the original graph, and then effectively reason on this subgraph to obtain the precise prediction.' This is similar to Definition 1 in section 3, which states, 'Instead of directly reasoning on the original graph G, the reasoning procedure is decoupled into two-fold: (1) one-shot sampling of a query-dependent subgraph and (2) reasoning on this subgraph.' These are also similar to what is mentioned in the introduction, 'Thereby, the reasoning of a query is conducted by (i) fast sampling of one query-dependent subgraph with the one-shot sampler and (ii) slow reasoning on this single subgraph with the predictor.'\n \n2.In sections 4.4, a significant number of symbols, abbreviations, and technical terms are employed. Some symbols are not adequately explained, which may potentially cause difficulties for readers during their reading. For example, the supp() in 4.4Theorem 1 does not provide an explanation.\n\n3.The formulas in sections 4.3 and 4.4 are not labeled, such as (6) and (7)."

Are there any guarantees regarding the robustness of reasoning results in the presence of perturbations in the data?\n\n3.What are the potential directions for future research or extensions of this work? Are there specific aspects or challenges within KG reasoning that remain open for investigation?"

This two step process ensures efficiency as the subgraph reduces the neighborhood over which the reasoning (link prediction) is done. Step (1) involved a Page Rank based procedure that selected a subgraph based on the importance of the nodes in the KG."

Why is the exploration/exploitation relevant for the proposed algorithms? While there is some intution behind the analogy with exploitaion/exploration the algorithm doesn't really formulate the problem using this analogy. For example there is no way to trade/balance the two. So this comparison relies on broad intuition, hence this advantage is a weak one at best. \n\n* Algorithm 1. define Alpha, K, define the shape of A and D.\n\n* How is the adjacency matrix A computed in the subgraph extraction part. Since this is a KG, not a homogenous graph, there are several adjacency matrices (one for each relation). Are these combined somehow? \n\n* I think the paper would benefit from pulling some of the technical details from the supplement to the main paper, in favor of reducing some of the verbiage in the main paper.
