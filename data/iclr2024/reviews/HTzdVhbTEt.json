As claimed in the introduction, the drawback of using RL based methods for unknown dynamics is the requirement of large amount of training data. In this paper, however, it is assumed that the model is already learned. So the problem is changed to an optimization problem with known parameters. Therefore, it does not seem to be a fair comparison that this is an improvement over RL based methods.\n2.\tAs cited in section 6, there are many existing works with different long-term fairness constraints. It is not clear what is the advantage of having a unified framework. For example, can this new framework solve the problem faster especially for more complex dynamics with large state space? Otherwise, the new model framework seems like a reformulation of existing models."

It would be much more beneficial to explore the performance of the model on multiple datasets to assess its applicability more comprehensively."

Particularly, the assume that the interaction between the algs and people can be modeled via a Markov chain and under assumptions such as irreducibility, aperiodicity and homogeneity it is guaranteed to converge to a single stationary distribution regardless of initial conditions. Given this setting they define an optimization problem to find a policy such that, if found, guarantees that the system converges, irrespective of the initial state, to a pre-defined targeted fair, stationary\ndata distribution. In their setting the probem in question is a linear constrained optimization problem and they can readily employ any efficient black-box optimization methods for this class.

Markovian assumption (memoryless behavior, linear systems) and even further the stronger assumption than the controller has the power to induce a MC with a unique attracting stationary distribution does not seem realistic to me.\n\nFirst of all, there are recent paper that examine dynamics in such settings but the dynamics driven by the agents strategically adapting their data are non-linear as the dynamics typically are in game theory. Of particular interest in this case is [1], where it is shown that such dynamics can be formally chaotic and in fact have periodic orbits of all possible periods. What this means is that these systems have infinitely many stationary distributions. (take the uniform probability distribution on each periodic orbit of length N for arbitrary N). This also happens for relatively simple settings of performative prediction with standard optimization/game theory dynamics. This is a dynamical system perspective that it is in stark contrast with the current one.\n\nNow there are some models of agent dynamics in the literature using MC (e.g. [3] and follows-ups) but in those papers there is a very expansive description of why the specific choices appropriate. In the current paper, I felt that these assumptions are largely there to make the setting tractable and reducible to a problem that we already know how to solve. Is there any way to connect game theoretic models (e.g. [3]) to yours?\n\nGiven that there no new computational or analytic tools developed I believed the main contribution of the paper is on the modeling side, hence I would like to see a more careful discussion of these choices instead of generic theory of MCs.\n\n[1] Piliouras, Georgios, and Fang-Yi Yu. \"Multi-agent performative prediction: From global stability and optimality to chaos.\" Proceedings of the 24th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation. 2023.\n[2] Narang, Adhyyan, et al. \"Multiplayer performative prediction: Learning in decision-dependent games.\" Journal of Machine Learning Research 24.202 (2023): 1-56.\n[3] Omidshafiei, Shayegan, et al. \"\u03b1-rank: Multi-agent evaluation by evolution.\" Scientific reports 9.1 (2019): 9937."
