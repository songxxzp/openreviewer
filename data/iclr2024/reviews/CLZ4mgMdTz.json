The only difference is the SNN module which reuses the inner states. Yet, this is just a minor change in my opinion. I would like to see more improvement, such as better SNN-based dense blocks instead of the naive one from ODSNN, or some SNN-based Transformer modules to better fuse temporal information\n\n### Experiments\n- The authors should conduct more experiments to validate their design. Only experimenting on one dataset is not enough. I would suggest the authors to test their method on 1MPx as well. Since the code of ODSNN has been released, it won't be very hard to compare with them on new datasets"

                "value": "- The paper writing is unclear about how S-SOD reuses the inner states of SNNs. Does it reuse it across time bins (25ms) within a single time interval (125ms), or if it also reuse it across time intervals, i.e., keep reusing throughout the entire event sequence? Since objects in an event sequence might stop moving for more than 125ms, we need temporal information longer than a time interval to detect these objects. Therefore, I think only the latter case is reasonable\n- It is still unclear to me how can S-SOD produce detections every 25ms instead of 125ms. The paper claims to \"... by accumulating the network output over T time steps and dividing it by T\", what does this mean? Are you running the SSD head to predict bboxes at the end of each time bin? Then what does accumlate+divide mean?"
