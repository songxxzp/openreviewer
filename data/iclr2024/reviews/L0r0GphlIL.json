Moreover, the extension to SGD is done not based on standard noise assumption. The new results on generalization are justified mostly by experiments, rather than in theory.\n2. The main assumptions are not clearly stated. I would suggest separating the assumptions rather than stating them at the beginning of each result. Moreover, the main result switches between stochastic (SGD) and deterministic settings (Newton's method), which makes it less accessible to the readers."

The study of parameter symmetries in deep learning focuses on the effects of these symmetries in terms of optimization and generalization performance. The present work contributes to this burgeoning field by first offering an analysis of \"teleported\" SGD, an algorithm proposed by [1] which uses the symmetries to move the current iterate to one with largest (under the group action) gradient. Their first contribution is an analysis which shows that teleported SGD yields improved guarantees for SGD for smooth (possibly non-convex) functions. It was shown in [1] that teleportation (in the GD rather than SGD setting) is equivalent to a step of Newton's method, and they accordingly give an estimate of its contraction rate that demonstrates quadratic convergence as would be expected from a 2nd order method. Their final theoretical results are sufficient conditions for one teleportation step to be optimal for all times. They then provide empirical studies of the effects of teleportation for increasing/decreasing the sharpness and curvature of minima. Finally, the authors consider teleported variants of other standard optimization algorithms (Adagrad, SGD with momentenum, RMS prop, and Adam), and propose a method for meta-learning the teleportation.\n\n[1] Symmetry Teleportation for Accelerated Optimization, by Zhao, Dehmamy, Walters, and Yu 2022"

They extend teleportation to commonly used optimizers and experimentally show that a teleportation step in the first epoch improves the convergence rate. Lastly, they incorporate teleportation into a meta-learned optimizer and show that learning the group element in teleportation improves the convergence rate of (meta-learned) gradient descent.
