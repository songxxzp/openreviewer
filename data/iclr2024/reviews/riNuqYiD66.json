One2Branch is shown to outperform direct linearization (One2Seq) on keyphrase generation."

Is it only optimized on the ZPLR loss ? If so, what happens if only positive labels are considered ? How does your method compare with simply selecting the highest scoring sequences instead of selecting sequences that have positive scores in average ? During decoding, the $k_{min}$ highest-scored tokens are guaranteed to be selected at each iteration anyway. Does your proposed method work without the ZPLR loss ? \n- Is your negative sequence a contribution ? It would be insightful to have a pointer towards some negative contrastive learning literature that you drew inspiration from and indicate the differences.\n- What value of $k_{min}$ is chosen for the computation of throughput / GPU memory usage ? How do they vary with different values of $k_{min}$ ?\n\n**Typo**\n- There seems to be a typo in the figure 2: dotted arrow should go from B to CB."

For the tasks where multiple outputs are possible (for example, a set generation problem), a popular way is to train a sequential decoder concatenating all outputs in a long sequence. This setup suffers from several limitations. \n\nThe paper introduces a branching decoder that can generate branch-out multiple generation paths. One very interesting contribution of the paper is the integration of the ZLPR loss (Su et al., 2022) that allows a threshold-based decoding algorithm (instead of heuristic approaches) for inference. During decoding the branching decoder generates new generative branches identifying  a dynamic set of tokens with logits exceeding a threshold (0 in this case). \n\nThe experiments are mainly done on keyphrase generation tasks focusing on three different datasets focusing on different domains and keyphrase lengths (avg 1.3 to 2.2 words on average). The results demonstrate that the branching decoder performs considerably better than the sequential decoders."

Natural language generation is inherently a set generation problem, for example, there could be multiple paraphrases for a sentence (paraphrase generation), same questions can be asked differently (question generation) and summary can be written differently (summarization).
