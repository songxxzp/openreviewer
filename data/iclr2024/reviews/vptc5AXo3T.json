The feedback form is determined based on the difficulty level of each input example when attempted by the unaligned model. Given a set of alignment examples, the paper first ranks them according to their perplexity estimated by the unaligned model (Vicuna-7B). Then, the ranked examples are evenly split into three groups: 1) easy (low perplexity) for which a critique type of feedback is elicited, 2) medium (medium perplexity) for which a refinement feedback is elicited, and 3) hard (high perplexity) for which preference feedback is elicited. To elicit critique feedback, an LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo) is first asked to criticize the initial answer and then asked to revise it accordingly. To elicit refinement feedback, ab LLM is directly asked to refine the initial answer. To elicit preference feedback, another answer is produced via a different LLM (Vicuna-13B) and another LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo) is asked to decide which of the two answers is better. Out of the three forms of feedback, the paper collects pairs of answers with one of them marked as preferred and uses them to apply straightforward RLHF or DPO. Automatic and human evaluation on question answering, dialog generation and text summarization show that the proposed approach outperforms relying on an individual form feedback."

For example, they are using perplexity to measure difficulty (see questions below) and groping problems into three groups. Why not four, for example, or just two: easy and hard? Also, why use another model (Vicuna-13B) to generate alternative answers? for the \"prefer\" feedback. Why not sample multiple answers as done in the standard RLHF settings?       \n\n- The main novelty of the paper is in constructing the feedback data described in section 3.3. However, by converting all feedback into comparison format, CDF is reduced back to the standard pairwise ranking setting. \n\n- In the intro, the authors criticize the data inefficiency of standard RLHF methods.

Could it be even better? One baseline of such a case should be provided to validate the necessity of grouping.\n2. From Table 1, it looks like that the QA and Dialogue related benchmark test sets show very small improvement for both the RM and GPT4 eval scores, however, the summary test set show substantial improvement between the proposed method and all baselines including those ablation baselines. This looks very weird. Why could this method present significant improvement over only one dataset among all three? A detailed analysis needs to be presented.\n3. In Table 3, how is the \"separate test set\" constructed here for testing the RM? I see that the the RLHF_{critic} shows the highest accuracy among the three baselines, which is contradictory to my intuition: in this baseline, Vicuna-7b is used to provide the revision, which should be worse than the revision provided by GPT3.5 in the RLHF_{refine} baseline.
