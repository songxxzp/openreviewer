The authors show that irrespective of the granularity of pruning, with the same layer-wise density, the \"synaptic expectation\" remains the same. Based on this, they propose methods agnostic to the initialized weights and data, directly outputting the layer-wise densities. Specifically, they introduce PreCrop and PreConfig, where the latter can have density constraints larger than 1, leading to the expansion of certain layers."

                "value": "- The paper uses layer density as the importance score and tries to maximize the sum of the layer densities with the FLOPs/Parameters constraints. This approach raises concerns, as it's an oversimplification to presume homogeneity in densities across layers. For instance, numerous structured pruning techniques for residual networks assign variable layer budgets, often designating lower density (or fewer channels) to the initial layers of residual blocks, aiming to create a bottleneck structure. However, the method described in the paper appears to uniformly maximize layer densities, which might not be optimal.\n\n- The results presented in Figure 5 appear to have an inherent bias. A model can be configured to prune a higher number of parameters while maintaining high FLOPs or the inverse. Thus, it is important for a fair comparison to compare both the FLOPs and parameters of the models at the same time similar to the baselines, rather than two different models optimized separately. \n\n- Pruning fundamentally revolves around removing the less important weights or weight groups. The paper's observations, albeit intriguing, deviate from this principle. The method's independence from weights and data might actually detract from its core purpose. In the absence of these elements, the method essentially evolves into a mere CNN architecture suggester. This is a simplified NAS problem, and although it is much more cost-effective than typical NAS algorithms, the objective of the search (which is to maximize the cumulative log of layer-wise densities) is not strong enough."
