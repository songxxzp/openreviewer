The main change of ReCAT is the proposed contextual inside-outside (CIO) layers, which are inserted into a standard Transformer encoder right after the embedding layer. The CIO layer consists of the bottom-up and top-down modules. By stacking CIO layers, the iterative bottom-up and top-down layer-by-layer passes can unsupervisedly construct syntactic structures for the input sequence and produce contextualized representations for tree nodes.\n\nBy pre-trained with masked language modeling (MLM) and then fine-tuned, ReCAT was compared with Transformer-only methods and Fast-R2D2 and showed superior performance on multiple sentence-level and span-level tasks. Moreover, the syntactic trees induced by ReCAT exhibit strong consistency with human-annotated trees, proving that CIO layers can accurately learn syntactic structures."

The authors leverage the linear neural inside algorithm proposed by R2D2 to prune cells that are unnecessary to encode during the bottom-up inside pass and propose to mix information from both inside and outside a span.\n\nThe benefits brought by CIO include (1) explicitly modeling syntactic structures without requiring parse tree annotations; (2) unlike previous work which only allows information flow within a span, CIO enables cross-span communications in a scalable way; (3) reducing the complexity of the inside-outside algorithm from cubic in DIORA to linear.\n\nThe major contributions are: (1) effectively combining ideas from two methods DIORA and R2D2 with innovative modifications. (2) introducing cross-span communication that breaks the information access constraint. (3) the experimental results on span-level tasks, natural language inference, and grammar induction demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Is the key difference scalability, the use of transformers, pruning, cross-span communication, or all of the above?
