However, the experiments due not include comparisons to some popular distributed algorithms (Data and Pipeline Parallelism). Addressing my concerns (especially W.1. and W.2.) and questions would improve my score.\n\nThe paper introduces BurstAttention, an efficient distributed attention framework designed to address the challenges associated with processing long sequences in Transformer-based large language models (LLMs). While attention modules have been essential for the success of LLMs, their quadratic time and memory complexities pose obstacles for long sequences. BurstAttention divides long sequences into partitions across distributed clusters and employs global and local attention optimization strategies to optimize memory access and communication operations. FlashAttention can be viewed as a specialization of BurstAttention on a single device. Experimental results reveal that BurstAttention reduces communication overheads by 40% and achieves a 2\u00d7 speedup in training on sequences of 32K length with 8\u00d7A100 GPUs, outperforming existing competitive distributed attention solutions. BurstAttention is also shown to adapt well to various optimization strategies and offers greater scalability in comparison to other solutions."

For instance, Megatron uses all-gather, which is highly optimized in NCCL. If the system uses P2P (and is the system using P2P? Can the author provide more details?), even the communication volume is less, the wall clock time can be higher. (2) In the experiment, the objective is causal language modeling, where the system seems to have unbalanced workload, e.g. the machine hosting first query will be idle most of the time. However, in Megatron, the workload is balanced because they do not partition sequences. Does the system balance the workload? If not, the system should be 2x slower than Megatron due to the unbalanced workload?\n\nThe reviewer is happy to raise score, if these questions are addressed clearly."

                "value": "1. The novelty of the paper is unclear. It seems to me that it is essentially a straightforward combination of three existing ideas: RingAttention (Li et al., 2022); online softmax (Milakov & Gimelshein, 2018); and FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). Further, the ring-based approach to attention seems essentially to be a variant on classic 1D distributed matrix-matrix multiplication algorithms or Cannon's algorithm with one dimension of the mesh trivial (see, e.g., Golub's \"Matrix Computations\" book, or the Cannon or Fox algorithm). One could imagine pipelining the distributed attention computation (it is unclear to me whether this paper does this), but then it still seems very similar to SUMMA (Van De Geijn & Watts, 1997).\n2. The analysis section seems quite perfunctory. It adequately describes the characteristics of the particular implementation, but does not address optimality. E.g., there are lower bounds for distributed matrix-matrix multiplication (via pebbling and in communication-avoiding algorithms) that could be used. Similarly, FlashAttention includes a lower-bound analysis that might be leveraged here.\n3. The experimental evaluation does not include any error bars or measures of variance. Especially since this includes cross-device communication, and BurstAttention introduces additional communication on top of existing methods (e.g., tensor or data parallelism) which may interfere, these are important to include.\n4. The experimental section lacks any detailed analysis of the algorithm and includes only end-to-end results. For example, what percent of peak device flop was sustained? How much communication is performed? What is the breakdown in runtime of communication and computation? How well does the local attention optimization perform (e.g., reduction in cache misses)? These sorts of analyses would help inform how BatchAttention performs in different scenarios, what its bottlenecks are, and why, precisely, it is faster than existing methods. (Further, the paper states in Section 1 that BurstAttention \"can fully optimize the input-output (I/O) and communication procedures in distributed clusters\", yet does not back this claim up.)\n5. The evaluation is conducted only up to 8 GPUs which are interconnected via PCIe. This is not especially large scale for training LLMs (although could be reasonable for fine-tuning), and it is not clear how the method will scale."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Please clarify the novelty of the paper (see above).\n2. Can you contextualize the analysis in Section 4 with lower bounds or otherwise provide an indication of how far BurstAttention is from optimal?\n3. Please add error bars (or similar) to all experimental results.\n4. Please expand the experimental analysis; see above for suggestions.\n5. How does BurstAttention scale to larger numbers of GPUs or on different networks?\n6. A related point, how does BurstAttention perform when combined with other standard parallelism techniques for training, e.g., data-parallelism/FSDP, pipelining, etc.? Does its additional communication cause interference?\n7. In Section 5.3, why fix the batch size to 1 for training? This seems quite small.\n8. In Section 5.4, why is a different sequence length used for scaling than is presented in the earlier results? This makes it hard to contextualize the scaling.\n\n-----\n\nIn light of the authors' response addressing some of my concerns, I have raised my score. However, I still remain concerned about the novelty and depth of the experiments."
