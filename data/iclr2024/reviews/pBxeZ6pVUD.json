                "value": "The paper introduces Conditional Slot Attention (CoSA), a novel variant of Slot Attention that incorporates the concept of grounded representations. Unlike the original Slot Attention, CoSA utilizes a dynamic binding scheme using canonical object-level property vectors and parametric Gaussian distributions. This approach enables specialized slots that remain invariant to identity-preserving changes in object appearance. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple downstream tasks, including scene generation, composition, and task adaptation, and achieves competitive performance compared to Slot Attention in object discovery benchmarks."

The author mentions that the method incorporates the object-level property vector, but there is a lack of evidence regarding how it functions. For instance, it is unclear whether the method can effectively discriminate between multiple instances with similar appearances. \n3. The visualization of the COCO results does not appear to be accurate, and it seems that the method may not be as applicable to real-world scenarios."

And the reasoning module with property transformation module enhances the interpretability of object property binding. The experiments show improvements on various object discovery benchmarks."

It takes inspiration from the recent research in binding problem and concludes three major challenges in unsupervised object discovery.

It employs the spectral decomposition for discrete mapping and enables the model to sample from different distributions corresponding to different object properties.\n3. The visualization of the separated object properties are interesting and shows interpretable Ground Slot Dictionary."

Or a randomly initialized encoder $\\Phi$ is also sufficient to provide cues for spectral decomposition and discritization?\n3. I suggest authors to run the trained conditional slot attention with grounded slot dictionary on some video data, e.g., DAVIS-2017, to validate whether the slot dictionary can track objects across time and more vividly show the binding ability to object types."

What if we use the predicted number of slots without the GSD?\n    - Conversely, how much is attributed to the GSD? What if we used a fixed $K$ with GSD?\n- What is the distribution of the number of objects for the different datasets? This would be important to interpreting the MAE values.\n- While I can appreciate the probabilistic interpretation of the model, I feel it does not add to the clarity of the paper and may be more appropriate for the appendix. Specifically, if I understand correctly, if $q(\\tilde{z}|x)$ is deterministic and $p(\\tilde{z})$ is uniform as in VQ-VAE, then the KL term is just a constant and not actually used to optimize the model?\n- The discussion of the different sampling strategies (Euclidean, Cosine, Gumbel) does not seem necessary for the main text since (from my understanding) the experiments in the main text are only done with the Cosine version? I do see additional experiments on other sampling strategies in the appendix, but if that is the case, this discussion can be removed from the main text."

How sensitive are the results to codebook size?\n- I want to confirm that the Abstraction Module is not differentiable and just uses the output of the encoder, which is trained through the Slot Attention path. Then, there are similarly no gradients flowing through the GSD and it is only updated with EMA (Appendix F). Is this understanding correct? If so, I think this could be stated more explicitly for clarity in the main text.\n- How are the dynamic number of slots $K$ actually implemented during training? From my understanding, different images in a batch may have different $K$, so this may need to be done with some masking of the softmax in Slot Attention, in which case a max number of slots still needs to be used. In that case, is the benefit in FLOPS only during inference for a single image?"
