The need to re-learn policies from scratch in PSRO is an efficiency bottleneck and there exist other works that have also tried to tackle this problem (i.e. NeuPL). Therefore, because PSRO generates a large amount of training data, it makes sense to try and re-use this data in a smart way in order to generate new policies. \n- Overall, the paper is well-presented and well-executed. It is generally well written and the experiment section is extensive and well-thought out in presenting the benefits of Dyna-PSRO."

This concern is two-fold:\n    1) There exists an extensive array of literature related to diversity within the PSRO framework which has not been discussed by the paper. For example [1][2][3][4][5]. In these works multiple diversity measures are recruited to measure the diversity over a PSRO population, and I would be interested if the authors could comment on specifically why they have chosen their variant of diversity measure over the others in the literature. \n    2) The paper seems to suggest that strategic diversity amongst the population is important. Therefore, why do the authors not perform any form of strategic diversity optimisation, in order to make the population policies more diverse than if they are learned in the classic PSRO way? For example, there are no results in the work that show that there exists much strategic diversity amongst the PSRO policies, and it is quite common from my own experience with PSRO that individual policies can end up strategically very similar without any diversity optimisation.\n\nReferences: \n\n[1] Policy Space Diversity for Non-Transitive Games - Yao et al. 2023\n\n[2] Open-ended learning in symmetric zero-sum games - Balduzzi et al. 2019\n\n[3] Modelling behavioural diversity for learning in open-ended games - Perez-Nieves et al. 2021\n\n[4] Towards unifying behavioural and response diversity for open-ended learning in zero-sum games - Liu et al. 2021\n\n[5] A unified diversity measure for multi agent reinforcement learning - Liu et al. 2022"

The benefits to the world model anticipated by increased exploration\n   (strategy diversity induced by the empirical game model). [Figure 2]\n2. The benefits to the empirical game model in calculating best responses when\n   allowed access to a world model. [Figures 3, 4]\n\n## Claim 1\n\n### Figure 2\nA world-model is trained from game trajectories generated by random play or\nPSRO-generated policies with restricted strategy spaces. This is reasonable for\nassessing Claim 1, above, but the results are not as convincing as one would\nhope (a clear trend between diversity of strategy-space samples and accuracy is\nnot established, nor are clear trends regarding accuracy *restricted to the\nstrategies used for training*). Moreover, the provided interpretation lacks\ncoherency: If class imbalance is causing problems, then perhaps simpler game and\nsetting should be used to demonstrate the desired claim.\n\nAs a minor point also regarding Figure 2: The way in which the results are\ncommunicated is somewhat confusing. For example, why use the matrices to\nrepresent combinations of strategies if we only considering symmetric strategy\nprofiles? Just give sets of strategies, e.g., $\\\\{1\\\\}, \\\\{2\\\\}, \\\\{1, 2\\\\}, \\\\{2, 3\\\\},\n\\\\{1, 3\\\\}, \\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$.\n\n## Claim 2\nThe experiments that address Claim 2, above attempt to do so by considering two\nforms of \"planning\". The motivation is that the use of world-models can benefit\nthe selection of best-responses to estimated payoff matrices and restricted\nstrategy profiles (ie, empirical games), where the world-model is used to train\na reinforcement learning model to select best-responses.\n\n### Figure 3\nA pre-trained world-model (learned from samples with a restricted strategy\nprofile) is used to pre-train an RL model for best-response in a \"planning\"\nphase, and this RL model is compared to a non-pre-trained baseline during real\nplay (Real play involves an opponent using a strategy omitted from the data seen\nby the pre-trained world model). This experiment is reasonably constructed and\njustifies the claim that the world model benefits the learned RL best-response\nmodel through background planning.\n\n### Figure 4\nI do not understand the distinction between Decision-Time planning as used in\nthis paper and Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) to obtain better estimates of the\nvalue function. Ostensibly, the RL model used for best-response planning is\nalready deploying the maximum-estimated-value action, no? In any case, the\nfigure appears to suggest that Decision-Time planning alone markedly *degrades*\nperformance, but this is ignored in the text. I do not see justification for the\nclaim that \"world models offer the potential to improve response calculation\nthrough DT planning,\" based on this figure. How does the figure support this claim?\n\nAs a minor point regarding Figure 4, the x-axis and alignment of the loss curves\non the right panel should be adjusted to agree with the analogous presentation\nin Figure 3, as is done in the left panel.\n\n## Main Experiments\nWhile a marked improvement over PRSO, Dyna-PRSO could be compared against\nadditional baselines in an ablation study --- i.e., against models that\nincorporate only the world model or only incorporate the \"Dyna\" RL component to\nsolve the empirical games component --- to more rigorously establish the claims\nof the paper."

As an example of what I mean, the authors state: \"This schedule starts out training as a variation of teacher forcing, and slowly transitions to fully auto-regressive.\" It's clear from this statement what is happening at a high level, but not the exact setup for how the models are trained. This kind of imprecision is unfortunately common in the current draft concerning the authors' approach. \n\nThe major weakness(es) of the paper are the results. Specifically, they do not fully seem to support the authors' stated claims. Section 3.1 seems to actually contradict the claims that empirical game learning can benefit world model learning, since the approach is outperformed in terms of reward prediction by a random sampling approach. Further, the games that are employed throughout the paper are rather simple in comparison to the common games used to evaluate world models (e.g. Pong, Doom, Pacman, Cheetah Run, etc.). I understand that the authors are focused on multiagent settings, but it might have been helpful to construct a setting more like a traditional world model environment, which would have also allowed for a comparison against a World Model baseline. As it is, my takeaway from the results are that world models benefit empirical games but not necessarily the other way around. This is still a contribution, but a more limited one with less general significance. It also does not match authors' stated claims and contributions."

                "value": "The authors provide a method for simultaneously learning world models (i.e. models of the transition dynamics) and empirical games (i.e. estimates of the per-player payoff). The main benefits of this are twofold: (1) by incorporating PSRO-style policy generation, one obtains a more diverse range of strategy dynamics, which then leads to more diverse data on which to train the world model and (2) by reusing a single learned world model within the PSRO training loop, one can achieve greater efficiency in subsequent generations of PSRO. The resulting algorithm (Dyna-PSRO) is shown to outperform PSRO in terms of the sum of regret against all policies generated by either method."

Given the recent success of world-modelling in single-agent RL (e.g. the Dreamer series), one might well imagine that world modelling can be used to good advantage for multi-agent RL. Moreover, the strategic diversity offered by PSRO may well lead to better exploration of the state space, thus aiding world model construction. The \"win-win\" here is intuitively sensible, and to my knowledge has not previously been investigated in the literature.\n\n- The related work section is reasonably thorough (although some recent citations are missed, see \"Weaknesses\"). \n\n- The Dyna-PSRO algorithm is well-described and the results in Figure 5 are reasonably convincing, with some caveats in the \"Weaknesses\" section below."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- I find it hard to understand why PSRO is a reasonable algorithm for the Harvest game, and the authors do not provide a strong argument or qualitative evidence here. At a high-level, the Harvest game reduces to a social dilemma, and therefore the Nash solution is not the desirable one (for it means that everyone will defect at the resources will be exhausted, leading to low individual and collective return). I suspect that PSRO and Dyna-PSRO are finding a variety of different solutions that succeed in defection. Indeed, low regret against exploitative opponents will exactly correspond to defection. Instead, what one should be looking for in this context are policies which incentivize others to cooperate (along the lines of opponent modelling, for instance). Now, world modelling does, in principle, help here (see this recent paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11358.pdf). But without clear measurements of the individual return, collective return and qualitative analysis of the policies, the reader cannot judge whether the world model yields better or worse outcomes in Harvest. This leads to a key question:\n\n(*) Do the PSRO or Dyna-PSRO agents find cooperative solutions in Harvest? If not (as the case seems to be from the discussion on page 5), what is the argument for using PSRO / Dyna-PSRO in this environment? \n\n- The order in which the paper is presented is confusing. The main algorithm, Dyna-PSRO, is not introduced until very late in the paper. Since this is the main result, the authors would do better to introduce this first, and then present the additional sections as ablations or analyses. \n\n- The results do not compare to existing strong baselines. For instance there are many existing papers that produce agents with good performance on Harvest and Running with Scissors (e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01470.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02274.pdf, https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08884). To what extent does this new method outperform the baselines? \n\n- The results are very hard to interpret. In Figure 5, why do the Dyna-PSRO curves terminate before the PSRO curves? In Figures 3 and 4, what is the difference between the left-hand plot and the right-hand plot? The Figure captions in Section 3.2 require significant clarification, because it is extremely hard for the reader to assess the results in this section at present. \n\n- There are several choices in the \"strategic diversity\" section which seem arbitrary and for which the authors have not provided motivation. For instance, why are two PSRO policies used? What is meant by \"the PSRO policies were arbitrarily sampled\"? Why are the PSRO policies subsampled, and what is meant by this? Why is sampling a different policy from PSRO a good test of generalization (as opposed to having a held-out policy for generalization trained with a method from the literature, which would seem like a better test, in my view)? \n\n- There are some missing citations e.g. to the Dreamer line of work (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04104v1.pdf and citations therein), the MuZero line of work (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00210 and citations therein), and the aforementioned paper on world modelling in the Harvest game (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11358.pdf)."

            "questions": {
                "value": "See \"Weaknesses\". \n\nOverall, I think that the motivation for the paper is strong and the Dyna-PSRO algorithm has merit. However, the authors must be more careful to measure the outcomes of social dilemma environments in terms of metrics that make intuitive sense (e.g. collective return) rather than simply measuring deviation from Nash. I hope that they are able to take on board the feedback above to improve the paper, and thus to rigorously demonstrate the benefits of world modelling in PSRO over existing baselines for both zero-sum and general-sum interactions."
