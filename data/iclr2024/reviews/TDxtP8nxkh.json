The whole experiment should be in an online fashion. Otherwise, the proposed method is just a prediction model and do not show its usability in HPO.\n2. The evaluation of resources used is unclear to me. Is the cost of training and infering NAP2 counted in calculation? Other baseline methods such as Successive Halving do not require extra computation, so you should probably compensate for those methods with extra computation to make it a fair comparison.\n3. On CIFAR-100, the comparison methods seem to perform extremely bad, e.g., none of them get any precision > 0. I wonder if the configurations are reasonable according to the original work? It is unlikely that these methods should use the same set of configurations. \n4. For figure 6, is it saying that the prediction model trained on CIFAR-10 is able to predict on CIFAR-100 with MSE error < 0.1? This is a bit surprising because the scale of accuracy is quite different, i.e., on CIFAR-10 the models can achieve 0.9 accuracy but should be much lower like 0.6 on CIFAR-100. I wonder how is the proposed method handle this difference in scale? \n5. In Figure 2-5, it seems that all 3 methods do not benefit with more resources, which is not intuitive. I wonder if the authors could include a simple hill climbing or BO baseline to better illustrate the results?\n\nOther weaknesses:\n1. The figures are hard to read. Please increase the font sizes."
