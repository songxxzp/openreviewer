                "value": "The paper studies the limitations of well-known expected calibration error (ECE) and the associated reliability diagram used for quantifying the miscalibration of a machine learning model. Among the core limitations of ECE, the fundamental ones are: discontinuous functional and impossible to estimate efficiently from samples. The paper proposes smoothECE and a regression method, which is ECE of the smoothed version of the original distribution and so the associated reliability diagram reflects a smoothed estimate of the calibration function. It claims that kernel smoothing allows realizing a consistent calibration measure and it provides a way of choosing the kernel bandwidth. The paper shows that SmoothECE has desirable mathematical properties, including consistent calibration measure and being sample and runtime efficient. Experiments have been performed on Deep Networks, Solar Flares, meteorological data, and synthetic data to showcase the comparison between ECE and proposed SmoothECE."

Thus Widmann et al.'s kernel-ECE is very useful for comparison but its adoption has been limited due to the interpretability (aka, lack of reliability diagram) problem. \n- Page 3 bottom \\tilde{K} is used before being defined\n- Page 5 (center): the methods would in fact apply to any of the binary-reduction-based calibration notions discussed in the paper \"Top-label calibration and multiclass-to-binary reductions\""
