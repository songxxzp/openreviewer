The detection process seemingly necessitates the logits of tokens, thereby mandating language model inference during the detection phase. This requirement poses substantial practical limitations, particularly for users with restricted computational resources, and significantly extends the time commitment for watermark detection compared to the methodology employed in KGW (2023). Crucially, accessing the language model's logits during detection implies that customers must possess knowledge of the prompt, a stipulation often unfeasible in real-world scenarios.\n\n2. Contrary to the assurances offered by KGW (2023), the detection algorithm articulated in this study does not furnish a stringent statistical affirmation concerning the rate of false positives.\n\n3. Concerning experimental configurations, the authors elected to compare their model against the KGW-k variant, where k represents the count of preceding tokens subject to hashing. It is evident that amplifying k inversely impacts watermark robustness under text modifications since any token modification influences the red-green list of k+1 tokens per the KGW (2023) framework. It would be expedient for the authors to pivot their attention toward the more resilient KGW-1 model, exploring the effects of varying parameters like watermark strength $\\delta$ and the red-green list delineation $\\gamma$.\n\n4. A scrutiny of Table 1 reveals a distinct advantage of KGW-1 over the Semantic Invariant Representation (SIR) in scenarios employing beam-search. This observation prompts the question of the necessity for SIR when KGW-1 already demonstrates superior robustness, efficiency, and a more systematic detection methodology."

I'm assuming that detection is performed by computing the watermark logits vector for each time step, checking if the vector entry corresponding to the observed text token at each time step is 1 (as these logits should roughly be $\u00b11$ given the saturated $tanh$), and keeping a running tally (in practice, a running sum of these selected logit values). This is basically how detection works with the watermark of Kirchenbauer et al., with the \"green list\" corresponding to watermark logits valued $1$ and the \"red list\" to logits valued $-1$. If this is indeed the case, it doesn't really come across in equation (7) -- the notation looks like we are taking the logit at the index corresponding to our current integer time step $j$ rather than the one corresponding to the observed token at the current time step $j$. I think either better notation or some additional explanation is needed.\n\nWhile the authors consider the attack of Sadasivan et al., they do not consider _adaptive_ attacks performed with general knowledge of their proposed watermarking method. Could a motivated attacker leverage a semantic embedding model of their own to better estimate or remove the watermark? Even with access to only a surrogate embedder model and no access to the mapping/watermark model, my intuition is that the tight correspondence between semantic embeddings and watermark logits might make such an adaptive attack feasible. If the number of semantic contexts that need to be observed to infer the watermark's \"rules\" in such a scenario is much lower than, say, the number of n-grams that need to be observed for KGM-n, this would constitute a serious security flaw.\n\nThe evaluation of the quality of watermarked text is somewhat limited, only covering perplexity."

I could see this becoming an issue as the length of the context passed to the semantic embedder increases, as new tokens will constitute an increasingly small portion of the context window. The provided example of text generated with the proposed method (Appendix A, pp.12) seems more repetitive than the Kirchenbuaer et al. examples. It would be interesting to know whether the authors evaluated the quality of watermarked texts in terms of repetitiveness or other metrics beyond perplexity.\n\nHave the authors tried using different fixed context lengths for the semantic embedder? Because the experiments in the paper use a generation length of only 200 tokens, the authors presumably feed all previous tokens to the semantic embedder. It would be interesting to see how short and long contexts (e.g. up to the limit of the embedding model) affect the performance of the watermark in terms of robustness, security, and text quality. The required context length could also have implications for the strength of the watermark as a function of the number of tokens generated, and its robustness to cut-and-paste attacks where generated text is spliced into human-written text [1].\n\nThe watermark of Kirchenbauer et al. allows for an arbitrary \"green-list\" size. With normalization, the distribution of watermark logits produced by the proposed method looks very symmetric (Figure 2c, pp.8), corresponding to a \"green-list\" size of 50% of the vocabulary. However, this is presumably computed in aggregate over the data distribution. In practice, do the watermark logits for individual time steps ever deviate significantly from an even split between $\u00b11$?\n\n\n[1] John Kirchenbauer, Jonas Geiping, Yuxin Wen, Manli Shu, Khalid Saifullah, Kezhi Kong, Kasun Fernando, Aniruddha Saha, Micah Goldblum, and Tom Goldstein.
