To achieve this, the continuous RGB value is encoded as an 8-bit binary (discrete) vector, and BCE loss is used to train the model. Experiments on novel view synthesis and neural surface reconstruction validate that the proposed classification method is superior to its regression variant."

Although the authors pointed out that the BCE loss is significantly larger than the regression loss, I'm still curious about the effect of using BCE loss only. Since the BCE loss is more dominant, is the regression loss essential?\n    - It seems that without text encoding, the performance is close to the final version. Moreover, only two scenes of one dataset are used to conduct the ablation study. I'm wondering, on average (all scenes and other datasets), is the text encoding essential, or is it optimal?\n\n2. The implementation and comparison are conducted based on methods published in 2020 and 2021. Only DVGO was published in CVPR 2022, which was also long ago. It is kindly suggested to conduct experiments on more recent SOTA methods to evaluate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach."
