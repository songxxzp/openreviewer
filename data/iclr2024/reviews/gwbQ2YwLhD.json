More precisely, the authors show that the (non-)linear score functions are sensitive to the units of measurement used for representing the data, which can at worst lead to the discovered graph encoding an incorrect set of d-separations. This then could lead to bad results in inference. The authors also propose an approach for mitigating the sensitivity to the variance. The theoretical results are complemented by multiple empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to provide evidence of the correctness of the claims."

One crucial observation the authors make is that poorly chosen units of measurement can lead to the discovered DAG encoding different conditional independencies than which the ground truth DAG encodes. I find this especially important since even finding a DAG from the equivalence class of the ground truth would be sufficient for many problems, but the paper demonstrates that the algorithms may fail to find such a DAG.\n\nThe empirical experiments demonstrate well the claims of the paper, i.e., model mean squared error and log-likelihood based losses leading to wrong predictions about the structure of the DAG."

In that sense, the issue with the scaling is already discussed in other works. However, that being said, I did not find a paper that particularly focuses on this issue in a self-contained manner.\n- The need for A2 remains unclear. In particular, the \"invertibility\" of the \"function\" in the related literature typically refers to the invertibility with respect to the noise, not with respect to the input. This is, in a general SEM Y = f(parents, noise), the f needs to be invertible with respect to the noise, but it doesn't matter for the parents. Otherwise, this would be an extremely strong assumption. In the case of additive noise models, this invertibility is always given by definition, since N = Y - f(parents), i.e., it is not a restriction on f. However, I might have also missed something here and maybe the authors can clarify this.\n- While you reference great related literature commenting on the same issue, it remains unclear where they lack and where you are filling the gap.\n- The proposed approach in Section 3.3 seems rather trivial. Here, I think the main focus of the paper should rely on the theoretical statements."

Some of my questions and remarks, which I hope the authors can address:\n\n- Consider introducing the graph G more formally as a collection of nodes/vertices and edges.\n- It would be very insightful to comment more on the assumption A1, since it seems to be very strong. For instance, the formulation of A1 implies that you only consider a chain or a fork or a collider, but none of the combinations. If this is true, this needs a particular remark and justification. Otherwise, it does not seem to be useful for any realistic graph structure beyond these trivial ones. \n- In this regard, at the end of paragraph 3, you say that with A1 you consider \"all possible substructures\", but A1 is clearly defined as \"either ..\" and not a combination.\n- Assumption A2 is a bit confusing, since typically, one only requires invertibility with respect to the noise and not the functional relationships (as mentioned in the 'Weakness' section). For instance in DAG-GNN, the \"invertibility\" only refers to the invertibility of Y = f(X, N) with respect to N. Similar to the previous point,  the need for A2 requires more justification and explanation, since it appears to be a very strong assumption in the current form.\n- The unit measurement assumption is a bit unclear. Why is the unit of a node relevant, since, as you also write it, the \"rescaling\" is part of the functional relationships. In particular, the current paragraph even reads as that these measurements need to be comparable, but looking at the theoretical statements, I don't see why. For instance, one could model \"Latency in ms -> Click Rates on a website as discrete number -> Revenue in dollars\", where all nodes have a completely different unit.\n- While I understand the focus on the MMSE, it should be noted that in an optimization task, some regularization is required. Otherwise, the best solution for ||X - f(X)||_2 is f(X) = X, the identity. Here, a brief remark on this would be insightful to avoid confusion.  \n- One of my concerns is that the theoretical statements are rather commonly known points. For instance, there is a clear connection between the least squares error and the conditional variance, which is clearly not scale invariant. However, as mentioned before, I still see the value in bringing all these points together in a single paper in the context of structure learning.\n- In Section 3.3, the exclusion of \"free variance terms\" needs more clarification. It currently reads as that one needs to know the graph structure to identify these terms, while the whole task is to infer the graph structure in the first place. I assume there is a misunderstanding where the authors can maybe comment on.\n- With regards to the previous point, maybe looking at the conditional variance instead of the marginal variance could help in focusing on the structural connection."

In addition, the adjacency matrix W will also be included in the penalty term. So, why does the score function directly degenerate into a square based loss function? Or, why is optimizing the score function equivalent to optimizing MMSE?\n3.\tIn practical applications, most of the score functions we choose are not affected by data normalization, just like the SRL function mentioned in this article. Thus, this article does not have a clear critical objective, or rather, the critical target seems to be rare in practical applications, which greatly reduces the significance of this study."
