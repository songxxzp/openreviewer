Here, two competing provers attempt to convince a verifier of a computation's correctness, relying on black-box judgements (like human feedback). This method ensures that any polynomial-time computation can be confirmed with just a few queries to the human judgment black-box. The model promises efficient verification, but it requires the AI models to produce comprehensive reasoning traces that can stand up to rigorous human analysis.\n\nThe researchers formalize a scenario where two AI models compete to convince a verifier, who can consult human judgment, of a solution's accuracy. The aim is to ensure the right solution is reached without excess computation and that human queries remain limited regardless of the complexity of the task. Protocols developed demonstrate success in various settings: deterministic human judgment, stochastic human judgment, and settings with witnesses."

The autoformalization project (e.g. Jiang et al.'s Draft, Sketch, Prove) relies to a greater extent on sound reasoners.

Perhaps an easy way to do this would be to show the $(A, B)$ machines yielding both True and False, due to the oracle's replies.\n\nThe probabilities in Definition 3.2 stood out: are these merely illustrative (so that any result could be replaced by arbitrary constants  $a$ and $b$), or would even qualitative results derived be overturned by use of different fractions (e.g. are there critical values for these numbers)?\n\nDefinition 6.1: can you provide an example of an oracle that is not $K$-Lipschitz?\n\n**FYI**\n\nNot questions re: the reviewing of this paper, but the sort of questions I would ask if talking to the authors about the research more generally. \n Thus, these do _not_ need to be answered here:\n1. is the argumentation procedure in Dewatripont and Tirole's \"Advocates\" a special case of this framework in any way?  Their approach to efficiency is different from that taken here, but may be complementary?\n1. the economic theory literature also contains models of 'cheap talk' and 'long cheap debate' (like a 'debate' in the current paper), in which two biased but informed advisors make comments to a decision maker, who tries to determine the true state of the world from their comments.  In the canonical version, the comments are intervals, rather than the present probabilities.\n1. Foster & Vohra's chapter on calibration, in which a decision maker attempts to identify whether or not a purported expert has true expertise, by means of repeated questioning, also seems generally related.\n1. Dung's abstract argumentation framework also came to mind, explicitly considering arguments and their attacks/refutations."

More specifically, the main motivation of this work is that the original framework assumes that the honest strategy can simulate AI systems for an exponential number of steps. The paper introduces new debate-based protocols, where this  dependence is polynomial.  Inspired by interactive proofs, the debate framework is modeled as a triple $(A, B, V)$, where $A$ and $B$ are provers and $V$ is a verifier, modeled as oracle Turing machines -- oracle models a human evaluator. The paper systematically studies the problem at hand, considering both deterministic and stochastic debate protocols. The results show that the proposed protocols are complete and sound, and that the prover that argues for the correct decision and the verifier run in a polynomial number of steps. Moreover, the number of oracles quires that the verifier requires is constant."
