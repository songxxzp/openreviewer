The choice to evaluate the results predominantly on a private dataset, rather than well-established clinical NLP datasets such as MIMIC-III, raises concerns about the reliability and generalizability of the drawn conclusions. Although the authors did incorporate the public MedNLI dataset, they pointed out certain imbalance issues. The principal analyses still predominantly focus on the private pathology dataset.\n\n2. The paper contains an extensive number of tables and figures. It is noted that even some key conclusions are presented in the Appendix. It might be beneficial for the authors to relocate some of the less important content to the Appendix and highlighting major results within the main text.\n\n3. The section evaluating clinical practitioners' perspectives appears to only incorporate feedback from a single practitioner, which is hard to support the claim that the findings in this work increase the interpretability to domain practioners."

Technical analysis is sound with multiple metrics and various comparison aspects, along with intuitive plots to support the claims and conclusions. The hypothesis testing of whether domain-specific transformer will outperform general-trained BERT (even only on a single case study) is very interesting and inspiring. \n- Clarity: the paper is easy to understand with nice writing flows throughout the problem construction, related work, experiment design, results discussion and conclusions. Assumptions and experiment design details are well-documented. \n- Significance: the paper demonstrates solid results and meaningful discussions about application of pre-trained transformers/models for other researchers to refer to, test new hypotheses and build new experiments upon."

It is somehow disappointing when the highly expected results are in the Appendix, e.g. feature dynamics comparison mentioned in page 7, but in Appendix A.9 (is it possible to quantify the feature dynamics and compare them in plots like Figure 1, e.g. limit to first and last layer); sparsity comparison of top 2 PCs on page 8 but results in Appendix A.7 (same suggestion to include e.g. 1-2 plots of last layer), etc. \n2. The potential application utility weakness of SUFO might lie in at the end of the transformer diagnosis towards a specific dataset, it is still unclear what transformer should an end user e.g. data scientist, choose from the five? How will SUFO provide robust and actionable insights based on the supervised and unsupervised analysis?"

Could enlarging the fine-tuning dataset address this challenge?\n- The conclusion for Table 2 seems vague.

Also, why the mixed-domian models BioBERT and Clinical BioBERT perform even worse than BERT?"
