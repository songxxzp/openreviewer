                "value": "The viability detection of the transplanted organs is an important biomedical issue. In organ transplantation, timelines are the most important thing. Gao19 proposed a well-designed noninvasive method evaluated the viability status of organs by detecting the variance change point of their surface temperature through exploring the entire data profile. However, most of the data in a temperature profile are redundant, which yields a waste of computational resources of their method. This paper proposes an accelerating algorithm with a well-designed dual control windows scheme that can be extended to online change detection. The proposed method significantly improves the computational speed and retains the same change detection power as the method Gao19. Simulation and application results demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method."

The algorithm for dual control windows is not well described and the details are a bit confusing, e.g. regarding the iterations over data profile index m and the iteration j in Algorithm 1.\n4. The test statistic \\Delta_n is shown in Gao et al. (2019) to asymptotically follow an extreme value distribution, which is how a rejection criterion can be chosen with control of the type I error.

Since each pixel of the thermal video is processed independently, a 3x or 4x speed-up is expected on a personal laptop.\n\n- It is not clear to me if the variance change point detection procedure (Section 2.4) is a contribution of this work. Can you clarify?\n\n- The new algorithm seems more accurate because the candidate change points are restricted to a window. This can prevent false detection on the edges of the signal. How is your method better than a post-processing of the change-points of Gao19 (e.g., by computing a window on the results of Gao19)? \n\nMinor comments:\n- In the title: \"An Effective Variance Change Detection Method under Constantly Changing Mean\".\n- L124: \"Large sample size will slow down the computational speed.\" This statement is vague. You could provide the computational complexity, for instance.\n- How are the initial change-points estimated at the beginning of the algorithm (Step 1)?\n- \"Equation 1\" instead of \"equation 1\".\n- typo L251\n- typo L178\n- typo L113\n- typo L116-117\n- More typos."
