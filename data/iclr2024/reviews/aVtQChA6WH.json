Existing reinforcement learning methods predominantly focus on the expectation of return distribution, while distributional RL methods, which extend this focus to the entire return distribution, have shown promising results. However, in off-policy evaluation within DRL, these methods lack theoretical development, error bounds, and convergence rate analysis. The paper addresses this gap by proposing the EBRM method, accompanied by its finite-sample error bounds, providing a theoretical basis for using expectation-extended distance in measuring distributional Bellman residuals. In particular, authors establish the application of expectation-extended distance for Bellman residual minimization in DRLs. A multi-step extension of the proposed method in non-realizable settings is also discussed, with corresponding finite-sample error bounds. The paper significantly contributes to the theoretical understanding of distributional off-policy evaluation in DRL."
