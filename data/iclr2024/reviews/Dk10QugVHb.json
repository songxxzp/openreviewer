The novelty of the paper may be limited, as there is already abundant literature studying correlations between image and attribute embeddings in CLIP (many already cited in the related work). The contributions of this study are 1) using attributes from social psychology instead of a self-defined list of words, and 2) claiming causality instead of correlation. The first contribution may not be enough by itself, whereas the second contribution is challenged in the following point. \n\nW2. The paper argues that the analysis conducted on the CausalFace dataset, in contrast to FairFace, implies causality and not only correlation because the elements/confounders in CausalFace can be controlled by the generation process. However, it could be argued there is not enough evidence to assume there are no confounders in CausalFace just because it has been generated synthetically. \n\nSpecifically, images in CausalFace have been generated using a GAN by imitating a training distribution. The training distribution may very likely present biases, which could be learned and transferred to the synthetic images. Hence, concluding that using synthetically generated images implies causality may not stand. It would be interesting to discuss how the potential biases in the image generation algorithm can affect the results of this study.\n\nW3. I would say the main paper is not self-contained. Many necessary details to understand the flow of the paper and its conclusions are placed in the supplementary material. This is a subtle way of evading the 9-page limitation. The supplementary material should be used for extra information only. Some examples:\n- The metrics computation, especially the cosine similarity between the image and attribute embeddings is essential to understand the results in, e.g. Table 1, but its definition is in Appendix A1.\n- The whole section 4.1 discusses results that are not in the paper but in Appendix B."

It isn't that these factors necessarily cause the largest deviations (of course other visibly salient factors will matter), it's that these factors are important for socially determined reasons, and therefore measuring model impacts and mitigating disparities/harms where they exist matters more"

                "value": "The paper studies biases in CLIP using a synthetic dataset of images generated by GAN, which they refer to as CausalFace. The authors argue that synthetic data offers the opportunity to control for possible confounding factors, such as lighting and pose, leading to a more accurate assessment of biases in CLIP. In their experiments, they consider different labels (e.g. \"friendly\", \"conservative\", etc) that are borrowed from prior works in social psychology (namely the the ABC Model and the Stereotype Content Model) and compare their embeddings with the image embeddings using cosine similarity.\n\nUsing this setup, the authors present several interesting findings. First, they find that non-protected attributes, such as pose and smiling, can have a non-trivial impact. In particular, the variance in the cosine similarity by changing lighting, smiling, and pose is comparable to the variance induced by changing protected attributes. In fact, the impact of \"pose\" is stronger than the impact of \"age.\" The authors study the effect of such factors at a greater depth; e.g.  image-related confounding factors, such as lightning, have less effect that subject-related factors, such as pose and smile. So, non-protected attribute can cause a significant amount of noise when doing bias-related analysis of CLIP. Second, the authors show that because such confounding factors can be controlled in CausalFace, new patterns emerge in CausalFace that are not visible in datasets like FairFace. This is demonstrated, for example, in Figure 2. \n\nOverall, the paper offers an interesting and useful insight when studying biases in multimodal systems. It highlights that confounding factors need to be taken into account, and that correlational studies would typically underestimate biases in models such as CLIP (because of the noise introduced by the confounding factors)."

There are other datasets such as UTK Face and CelebA that can be included to support the argument further. It's not clear if the conclusions in FairFace would continue to hold so showing that they hold in other datasets would strengthen the argument. In addition, MIAP (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/miap) is quite different from FairFace in that it collects images in natural settings (not just face images) so I would expect those confounding factors to be even more prominent in that dataset. This would be a useful message to point out.\n- There are important places that need further clarity. For instance, can you please provide a precise mathematical definition of \"markedness,\" similar to how WEAT is defined in the appendix? Page 5 explains it a bit but a precise definition should be included. Also, which specific prompts did the authors use to create various levels of \"pose,\" \"lightning\", and \"smile\"? They are not described in the paper or the appendix as far as I can see.\n- The authors focus on sentiment related attributes, such as warmth, communion, competence, etc. It would make sense for these attributes to be impacted by confounders, such as pose and smiling. But, there are other equally important association biases, such as relating gender with occupation, that may not be as sensitive to those issues. These are not studied in the paper."
