This strategic addition ensures that the prompt pool remains consistent with token embedding from both intermediate and final layers. Importantly, the implementation of the QR loss is efficient, adding no extra computational burden during the inference phase."

This leaves questions about its applicability in broader, real-world scenarios where data variability and volume might be significantly higher.\n2.\tLack of Exploration on QR Loss Limitations: The introduction of the QR loss is innovative, but the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion on its potential limitations or scenarios where it might not be as effective. A deeper dive into the trade-offs associated with the QR loss would provide a more balanced view of its utility.\n3.\tComparative Analysis Depth: While the paper highlights the superiority of the OS-Prompt over the CodaPrompt method, it might be beneficial to see how the proposed framework fares against a wider array of contemporary methods. A more extensive comparative analysis would offer readers a comprehensive understanding of where OS-Prompt stands in the broader landscape of PCL techniques."
