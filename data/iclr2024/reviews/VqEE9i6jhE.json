However, that paper and much other literature on approximation of kernel/Green's matrices is using *block* low rank structure of the Green's matrices. The low-rank structure arises as a result of e.g., interaction of far away particles, which is described by a block given by a subset of rows and columns of the Green's matrix. The overall Green's matrix is invertible. This is why H-matrices, HSS-matrices, and the butterfly decomposition all try to apply low-rank approximation on blocks and not the overall the matrix. The use of tensor train decomposition here makes sense, it is to an extent capturing the block low-rank structure. But the paper does not present things in this way and I believe claims that Green's matrices generally admit good low rank approximations to be false/misleading.\n - The paper does compare its approach to relevant literature beyond very brief qualifications in the introduction, prior to definition of the new method.\n - The combined tensor product grid, as far as I see from the mathematical definition, is just a tensor product grid with random as opposed to uniform spacing in each dimension. This can be presented in simpler terms.\n - The experimental evaluation seems to consider only very simple PDE model problems, without noise. These types of methods would be of interest to apply to experimental data to infer complex dynamics.\n - The experimental results do not compare to any other existing methods. It would also make sense to compare to a tensor train with plain tensors, instead of neural nets in place of tensors.\n - The paper uses python notation instead of mathematical notion (eq 10), and contains frequent minor wording errors.\n\nOverall, I do not recommend the paper for publication in its current form, as I think the above weaknesses are major deficiencies that are not easily fixed."
