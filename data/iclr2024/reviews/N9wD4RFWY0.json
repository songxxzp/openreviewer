If the task is to improve the baseline model, can I \"improve\" it by sticking it as one branch of a model that uses a much larger pretrained model? Why / why not? \n\nRight now, the problem I see is that the work is a collection of ~15 already existing tasks, with ~6 of them having arguable relevance to contemporary ML research. There needs to be additional work on top of this to make it a generally usable benchmark, such as constraining the actions of the agent, or defining each task more precisely, or adopting a principled definition of a research workflow and only including tasks based on that."

Though the main point of the paper is proposing a benchmark, there is relatively little information on how these tasks were selected and how the benchmark was constructed. The benchmark consists of only 15 tasks, and while there is some detail on the attributes that made the authors select these tasks, there are not enough to convince me that this is a thorough enough benchmark in its current state. Issues such as potential data contamination, formalizing what aspects of research are being tested and how these are addressed by the chosen tasks should be explained further.\n2. Relatedly, the framing of this as an AI benchmark is slightly misleading. It tests LLM ability to complete research in empirical machine learning tasks, but does not test their ability to do other types of research (e.g. more qualitative or descriptive research not based purely around achieving performance increases). Though some elements of the process may remain the same, 15 tasks from machine learning are not enough to test an agent\u2019s overall research ability.\n3. The success criteria for these tasks involves models improving performance by >10%. This strongly limits the types of tasks that can be tested, as discussed in the previous point. However, it also provides limited insight into the performance of the model. One of the strengths of this paper is the analysis of the types of errors models make, but this is all done through human evaluation. For tasks involving many reasoning steps where lots can go wrong, it would be more valuable to see some breakdown of which step the model failed at or some other type of automated error analysis."

Did you study this at all, either by looking at the data or comparing the similarity of model output to existing solutions?\n2. Was human annotation performed by the authors? What was the criteria for annotation? If it was not performed by the authors, how were annotators recruited/paid?\n3.
