Regarding the first finding, this paper isolates the activation direction and demonstrates its causal relevance in both toy tasks and real-world datasets. As for the second discovery, this study uncovers the underlying mechanisms associated with the aforementioned direction, emphasizing the roles of a select group of attention heads and neurons. To investigate and corroborate these conclusions, the paper conducts experiments using four datasets, as well as GPT-2 and Pythia models."

The statements in the abstract and introduction indicate that this paper investigates the representation of sentiment in LLMs. However, the experiments employ GPT2-small for movie review continuation, Pythia-1.4b for classification, and Pythia-2.8b for multi-subject tasks. GPT and Pythia may not be representative of the broader spectrum of LLMs, which reduces the persuasiveness of the conclusions drawn from the study.\n\n2. There is no caption provided for Table 1 in the paper. Furthermore, Figure 2 is predominantly featured in Section 3, but there exists a substantial gap between its initial reference and the section in which it is discussed.\n\n3. The proposed ToyMovieReview format, \"I thought this movie was ADJECTIVE, I VERBed it. Conclusion: This movie is,\" appears to be more suitable for sentence-level sentiment analysis. It may not be as effective for other sentiment analysis tasks, such as document-level sentiment analysis or fine-grained sentiment analysis. Furthermore, the rationale for emphasizing adjectives and verbs in this specific prompt design remains unclear, as it has not been adequately explained in previous sections of the paper.\n\n4. In Section 4.1, the authors find that the model employs a simple and interpretable algorithm to perform the task. However, this algorithm has not been supported by corresponding experiments, thus failing to demonstrate and illustrate the use of summarization for retaining sentiment information."

THe linear representation hypothesis suggests that large language models learn representations of text that are linearly related to meaning or related notions. In this work, the authors evaluate this idea for certain large language models (GPT-2 and Pythia) on several datasets, including toy datasets, SST and OpenWebTet, for the notion of sentiment.\n\nTo find the directions among intermediate layers of the language model, the authors propose to use simple techniques such as mean of the activation vectors, linear probing, PCA and DAS. They discover such directions for the toy datasets and evaluate it via correlation analysis. Similar analysis on the other datasets, including activation patching leads them to discover that sentiment is being aggregated on various punctuation tokens in the text, which they call summarization motif.\n\nWhile containing potentially interesting ideas, I find the writing poor and hard to understand. A lot of terms are left undefined, the diagrams are essentially the only quantitative part of the work and the reader is left to decipher or understand a lot of the references by themselves.

This paper studied how large language models represented their sentiments. The authors argued that the sentiment is represented linearly, i.e., there is a vector pointing in the direction of positive (or negative) sentiment. In addition, the authors proposed the summarization motif -- a phenomenon in an LLM that aggregates information (about sentiment) at indiscriminative tokens (e.g., commas). \n\nTo prove the linear sentiment representation, the authors applied several approaches to extract the sentiment direction from a small toy dataset and performed directional activation patching. In the experiment on a subset of SST, the results showed that the direction was significant to the logits -- enough to flip the prediction up to 53.5% of the time.  \n\nTo prove the summarization motif, the authors applied a similar patching method to the commas (or periods?) and compared it with patching all tokens. The results showed that only patching commas contributed to more than half of the drop in accuracy (38% to 18%) on a subset of SST. Additional analysis of another dataset showed that the further the relevant phrase in a prompt, the more apparent the summarization motif was."

While this is already an interesting finding, it has weak support for the claim. The author should either clarify this or lower the claim.\n\n2. Linearity. The authors claimed that the sentiment was linearly represented. Still, the evidence was rather weak on the real dataset (SST), especially the vectors discovered by simple linear methods like PCA or logistic regression. The effect was more prominent than the random directions, but it did not support the linearity claim. While the authors explained that the direction was discovered from a small dataset, we could also explain that there was more than one direction or simply nonlinear sentiment space.\n\n3. Distance. While the author experimented with a toy dataset and injected irrelevant content, I found the relationship between the \"summarization\" and the context length interesting. However, this could be made stronger -- the authors could find sentences in SST with varied lengths and commas to support the relationship.\n\n4. Inconsistency.
