                "value": "Imitation Learning (IL) enables agents to mimic expert behaviors. Most previous IL techniques focus on precisely imitatiing one policy through mass demonstrations. However, in many applications, what humans require is the ability to perform various tasks directly through a few demonstrations of corresponding tasks, where *the agent would meet many unexpected changes when deployed*. In this scenario, the agent is expected to not only imitate the demonstration but also adapt to unforeseen environmental changes. This motivates the authors to propose a new topic called imitator learning (ItorL), which aims to derive an imitator module that can *on-the-fly* reconstruct the imitation policies based on very limited expert demonstrations for different unseen tasks, without extra adjustment. In this work, the authors focus on imitator learning based on only one expert demonstration. To solve ItorL, the authors propose Demo-Attention Actor-Critic (DAAC), which integrates IL into a reinforcement-learning paradigm that can regularize policies' behaviors in unexpected situations. Besides, for autonomous imitation policy building, they design a demonstration-based attention architecture for imitator policy that can effectively output imitated actions by adaptively tracing the suitable states in demonstrations. They develop a new navigation benchmark and a robot environment for ItorL and show that DAAC outperforms previous imitation methods *with large margins* both on seen and unseen tasks."

The \"Demo-Attention Actor-Critic\" (DAAC) algorithm is proposed, which uses uses context-based meta-RL with an imitator reward. The imitator reward is based on a heuristic measure of similarity to expert state-action pairs. The proposed architecture uses an attention mechanism which computes attention scores between the current state and the states in the demonstrations, and it is argued that this provides implicit regularization of the policy behavior. Results are shown in maze environments where global map information is not known, as well as state-based robot manipulation tasks."

The problem/approach includes aspects similar to meta-RL, meta-IL, online imitation learning, and IRL but the precise problem statement seems to be original.\n- The authors provide ablations of their proposed reward function and architecture and show that both components are useful for performance.

For example, it seems that this assumption may not hold in a variety of robotic manipulation tasks where some subtasks may be irreversible.\n\n- The proposed imitator reward (a) relies on a distance function between states (which could be hard to scale meaningfully to high-dimensional observations) and (b) has several heuristic components and hyperparameters to tune.\n\n- Related to the above point: One concern is that the method (including architecture and the reward mechanism) might not generalize well to other tasks, since there are multiple moving parts and hyperparameters to tune. Have the authors looked into testing on existing meta-RL benchmark suites (e.g. Meta-World)?\n\n- The demonstration-based attention architecture relies on performing attention between the demonstration states and the current state. As the authors briefly mention, there are issues with this approach when the demonstration states are faraway from the current state. It does seems quite possible that faraway states may be encountered (e.g. due to compounding error, exploration, etc.)\n\n- I think the paper could be organized a bit better overall, and a variety of important details are left to the Appendix. For example, it would be good to include more discussion of related work in the main paper, especially comparisons to online imitation, few-shot imitation, meta-RL, meta-imitation learning etc. when defining the imitator problem."

Further, could the authors provide evidence that using the attention network is an effective policy regularizer? It seems that this regularization term would also be pushing the behavior to the \"way the task was accomplished\" according to the expert.\n\n- Each iteration of the algorithm requires running SAC to update the task-information extractor/context-based policy, which could be costly. Could the authors please provide details on how costly the algorithm is to run?\n\n- As the authors mention, DAAC's performance is limited in scenarios where the ground truth state is not available.

Though it is also mentioned in Appendix F, there is no corresponding assumption in the task formulation section.

This assumption narrows the application in more complex scenarios and makes it not a real out-of-the-box imitation method.\n\n2.\tI think the setting and proposed architecture are very similar to Mandi et al.[1].
