                "value": "Language model planning frameworks operate iteratively by generating one action per time-step, appending it back to the prompt (along with observation for closed-loop planning), and repeating the process until the task is executed. Such approaches are token-inefficient because of their repetitive use of prompt tokens (which includes the task, action-observation history, and in-context exemplars) for each action-step generation. Moreover, in closed-loop planning, such methods may often lead to infeasible action steps, thus, requiring corrective steps/replanning (local or global). In this paper, the authors propose a way to make closed-loop planning (i) more token-efficient (i.e. requiring fewer tokens) than an iterative planner and (ii) more replanning efficient (requiring fewer corrective steps). \n\nSpecifically, the authors propose to sample multiple plans from the LLM in a non-iterative and offline fashion (Plan Sampling). These plans are then merged into a tree-like structure to avoid repetitive actions (Action Tree Construction). Finally, these executable actions are selected by prompting the LLM with the task, current observation, and the history of executed actions (Grounded Deciding). The non-iterative plan sampling approach is more token-efficient. The tree-like structure helps to backtrack and select different steps in case of action failure without having to plan from scratch, avoiding large token costs."

Considering how generating and planning over tree-like structures have been explored in the past in open-loop/offline planning [A][B], where planning trees are generated iteratively, while simultaneously grounding the actions, the only novelty here is to decouple the tree construction from the grounding (Grounded deciding) for token-efficiency. Backtracking is also something that has already been introduced in Tree-of-Thoughts, although not in a proper task-planing framework. \n\n* Clarity: From what I understand, the sampled plans were generated in one go (non-iteratively) to avoid higher costs.

In the first stage (plan sampling), an expensive set of calls to the LLM is used to sample a number of full plans. These plans are aggregated into a tree structure which is then searched over in the second stage of the planner. The main source of efficiency (wrt LLM costs) is that the second stage (grounded deciding) can use a simpler prompt to perform action selection (instead of action generation). Experiments on tasks from the VirtualHome domain indicate the method is far more efficient without any loss of performance, compared to strong baselines."

In this context, the state, the observations and the actions are represented as text. \n\nIn previous work, called iterative-planning in the submission, When an action is executed, another call to a LLM appends the observation and attempts to obtain a new action. In the planning literature, that is close to what is called integrated planning&execution, as the agent must choose actions for achieving the goal, but observations might lead the agent to change the course of action completely.\n\nIn contrast, the paper follows a more restricted mode that can be more efficient under some circumstances: offline planning, then execution of the plan. This is the more studied case in the symbolic planning literature, where offline planning has received much more attention than execution.\n\nThe proposed algorithm \u001f\u2014Tree-Planner\u2014 is relevant for domains expressed in text, where a LLM could approximate a world model, and could produce a plan using knowledge widely available in text. \n\nWhile the task can be formulated as a POMDP, the initial phase \u2013called plan sampling\u2013 does not deal with further possible observations but just the general scene. Indeed, the samples are converted that represent common prefixes of the plans. So, the policy from plan sampling can be seen as a stochastic policy. That makes sense in some cases, but it generally cannot solve POMDPs where policies might need to map state distributions into actions, and update state distributions with new observations.\n\nAlways assuming the use of a LLM, the main hypothesis mentioned in the abstract are:\n1. Tree-planner might be more effective than alternatives like iterative planning by avoiding redundant error correction.\n2. Tree-planner might have a lower token cost.\n\nThe second hypothesis is true, almost by construction, as the algorithm only needs less information about actions and objects. The first hypothesis is only studied for VirtualHome, a domain of some interest. The main claim is that backtracking allows more effective recovery than appending the error and letting the LLM recover.\n\nThe paper shows how high-quality data was refined to allow the evaluation of metrics like success rate. \n\nThe experimental setup reports a comparison with baselines including iterative-planning, all using the proprietary LLM GPT-3.5.\n\nThe results show improvements in the 35 tasks of the dataset. For N=50 samples, the best possible GCR (goal condition recall) reaches 81.2% of the tasks."

                "value": "- Not clear if the policy is grounded in the environment or in the LLM implicit distribution.\n\t- Section 3.1 mentions the initial observation as part of the prompt, but the prompts in section F include a long \u201c(observation)\u201d for iterative planning and the grounded-deciding phase, but **not** for plan sampling.\n\t- If a detailed initial observation is given, then it\u2019s possible that many of the actions are grounded on them, reducing the significance of seeing the algorithm as dealing with a POMDP.\n\t- If a detailed initial observation is **not** given, then the LLM might be retrieving possible courses of action given the initial description but not grounded in the environment.\n\t- Both scenarios diminish the apparent significance of the work.\n- No discussion of the systematicity of LLM-based planning.\n\t- LLM-based planning is a popular topic, but the increasing body of work might call for a more careful examination. Each paper in this direction is an opportunity to examine the problem and the methodology.\n\t- In general, planning seems easier in the \u201chappy path,\u201d where text with high likelihood matches what might work in an environment, but things can get more complicated quickly.\n\t- Consider the task of \u201ccalling Mary using the cell phone\u201d. A good plan is not about assuming that the cell phone is on a table but exploring the space until the cell phone is found. A diverse set of plans might include the more usual places, perhaps even mentioning multiple places in a single path. But it\u2019s possible that the cell phone is in the fridge or in the supermarket bag. \n\t- While the prompt in the grounded deciding phase includes the full observation, the super-market bag would be there, prompting to choose among a few actions to pass the responsibility of examining the supermarket bag and the freezer to the plan sampling phase.\n\t- It\u2019s possible that finding a cell phone might require samples beyond a fixed N, and no alternative is offered.\n\t- So, the **key underlying problem** is that a flexible plan dealing with observations **cannot** be found using a fixed number of samples. Some tasks might require fewer samples, and some might require more. That\u2019s precisely why planning algorithms use search.\n- Experimental significance: a single environment with only 35 tasks.\n\t- The dataset subsection explains that 35 tasks were used, but the tasks were not listed. The VH has many other tasks. The 35 tasks may be biased in a way that affects the significance of the observations.\n- Experimental significance: Only VH\n\t- There are other environments for testing these ideas. For instance, the reference below. The related work section must cover what other alternatives are used in related work and why it\u2019s a good idea to select only this environment.\n\t- (Jericho) Hausknecht, Matthew, Prithviraj Ammanabrolu, Marc-Alexandre C\u00f4t\u00e9, and Xingdi Yuan. \u201cInteractive Fiction Games: A Colossal Adventure.\u201d arXiv:1909.05398 [Cs], February 25, 2020. http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05398.\n- In general, given the absence of task descriptions and their plans, it\u2019s hard to know whether the results are significant.\n\t- Even if we have the 35 tasks and their plans, the results might be an artifact of this particular environment. Perhaps the current version of GPT 3.5 is better at those household tasks than at navigating in a store to buy groceries.\n\nSecondary issues:\n\n- Goal Condition Recall might be a misleading metric\n\t- different subgoals might be easier than others\n\t- we don\u2019t know the structure of the subgoals \n- Confusions in the theoretical emphasis on POMDPs.\n\t- The hallmark of POMDPs, being a Markov decision process, is the Markov assumption: decisions can be made just by looking at the state without the history. However, the policy in section 2 includes the history of actions but perhaps not the observation history.\n\t- The emphasis on POMDPs is over-stated as the VH has high visibility while other environments feature more partial observability  (for instance, Jericho)\n- Global replan is non-comparable with other algorithms.\n\t- Whether it\u2019s possible to teleport to the initial state or not fundamentally changes the problem.\n- The notion of inverse actions is a form of symbolic knowledge, leaving the scope of the paper.\n\t- A more purist approach would task the LLM to undo the last k actions, perhaps offering the list of actions.\n\nMinor\n\n- The best GCR in section 5.2 is interesting, but GCR is not a good predictor of SR (success rate).\n\t- Actually, in Table 2, the gap between GCR and SR is higher for Tree-Planner than for other approaches.\n\t- Related: Table 3 reports 45.5% of errors due to missing correct plan.\n- It must be clarified if the LLM is called when there is only one possible action.\n\t- Some action trees in the appendix have a few actions with no branches. This affects the overall cost but not other statistics.\n- Alg 1 doesn\u2019t add much. Any algorithm for building a \u201ctrie\u201d data structure would work.\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n- The paper should distinguish the world model from planning. Discussing the percentage of correct plans is useful but not actionable in a new domain as the set of possible plans in a domain is heavily unbounded.\n- The directions suggested in error analysis (re-sample, chain-of-thought, self-reflection) might increase the context size, reducing one of the advantages."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- What are some other environments where this method could be tested?\n\t- Why was only VH selected?\n- Given a fixed task, is the same prompt used for the four scenes?\n- Does the observation of plan-sampling include the full description of the room or just the type of room?\n\t- I understand that in VirtualHome, the top-down view allows the agent to see everything except what\u2019s hidden in containers like drawers.\n\t- The prompts in section F include a long \u201c(observation)\u201d for iterative planning and the grounded-deciding phase, but not for plan sampling.\n- Did you consider adding the observation history?\n\t- The list of actions with the observation context where they were made might need to be more informative.\n\t- Unless the observations are monotonic, meaning that after each action, the agent observes more and more. For instance, if once the agent opens a drawer, it would still see what\u2019s there.\n\t- Are the observations monotonic?\n- GCR metric: what\u2019s the distribution of the number of goal conditions? Are the number of goal conditions the same for each of the 35 tasks?\n- Sect 5.2\n\t- Did you randomize the results for table 2? A new seed might generate another set of plans.\n\t- What would be the results for SR? Table 1 shows how GCR grows with SR, but doesn\u2019t predict SR. Actually, the gap between GCR and SR is higher for Tree-Planner than for other approaches.\n\t- Related: Table 3 reports 45.5 of errors due to missing correct plan.\n- What is the inverse of all the actions? \n\t- The supplementary material lists them, please list the corresponding inverse, say how that information was obtained, and discuss how realistic it is for that information to be available or learned.\n- Branches in action trees.\n\t- Some node action trees have no branches. See leftmost path Fig 12. Is the LLM prompt for choosing one action or are they executed? Is this accounted in the cost of the predictions?\n- Please report the average number of branches for reaching the leaves for each of the 35 tasks. This is equivalent to aggregating sequences without branching into a single action. For instance, Fig 12 has 8 leaves with [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3] branches, average 2.125 branches per leave. So, the agent should make an average of 2.125 decisions when following that branch.\n- Please discuss the number of error corrections in Table 1 compared to the number of branches. Otherwise, it\u2019s hard to know whether 3.29 vs 1.86 is a significant difference.\n- Sect 4.1: Dataset: what are the 35 unique tasks?\n\t- VirtualHome has multiple programs for some tasks, not a single gold plan.\n\t- Did you create new scenes or used scenes in VH?\n\t- Are the gold truth plans associated to a task or to (task, scene)?\n\t- Please list the 35 tasks descriptions.\n\t- What is the distribution of the number of steps for the gold truth? Even better, provide this information for each task\n- Methodological: was N=50 selected using the 35 tasks?\n\t- Is it possible that examining the tasks leads to bias in the selection of N?\n- Sect 4.1: implementation.\n\t- Was majority vote only used for grounded-deciding? Please add a reference for the method.\n- Table 3: errors for Tree-planner N 25\n\t- Is this success rate, SR?\n\t- The false negative is misleading. In the appendix, the error explanation says that the environment reports that there is no keyboard. Are keyboards part of the possible objects? The observations in the prompt mention a computer but no keyboard.\n\t- The example of the keyboard should be an environment misunderstanding.\n\t- Please fix the tables, and refine the definition of false negative. Perhaps you might to add false negative to the missing correct plan, calling it \u201csemantically correct.\u201d\n- What are the error modalities with correction?\n- Sect C.1 describes performance across plan length. \n\t- Can you provide the statistics for other approaches?\n\t- What about kind of task?"
