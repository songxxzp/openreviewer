Comparison with Zero1-2-3: Although the authors claim \"significant improvements over existing method\", the qualitative comparison in figure 5 does not significantly support this claim. The improvements in terms of quality and sharpness are noticeable, but there seems to be a potential trade-off in consistency. Moreover, the supplementary videos are missing a direct comparison with Zero1-2-3, and the quantitative comparison with Zero1-2-3 is comparable, which further weakens the claim (in limited 3D results and examples). \n2. The paper does not provide details on how the weights for the 2D and 3D priors are chosen. If these weights are determined and tuned during training and are inflexible during inference, this approach might not be the most effective way to integrate the priors.\n3. The model's inherent assumption of a frontal reference limits its versatility. This is evident from the removal of four examples from the training dataset that do not meet the front view assumption. That could potentially limit the scale of 3D datasets and this could lead to even lower generalization and a drop in result quality.\n4. The coarse-to-fine process, while effective, isn't novel as it has been employed in other works like Magic3D.  The Tetrahedral \nrepresentation seems to be hard to scale and appears to be optimally suited for objects. This could limit the method's applicability to a broader range of scenarios."

The real challenge should be to extract the unique advantages of both priors for a superior result, not just to find a balance between the two. I'd suggest the authors to add more comparison with Zero1-2-3 or include results to prove clear improvements without poor sacrifice of multi-view consistency in figure 5. \n2. The paper should provide evidence of improved geometric detail and not just enhancements in the output rendering quality. Merely augmenting the contrast or enhancing the visual appeal with a 2D prior is insufficient. Could this method result in sharper geometric details as well?"

The approach uses two-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline that first optimizes a NeRF to produce a coarse geometry and texture, and then refines it using a memory-efficient differentiable mesh representation (DMTet) for high-resolution renderings.

Is it hard to reconstruct objects that are in a cluttered environment?  \n  > c. Is the DMTet algorithm affected by inaccurate segmentations?  \n  > d. What happens in instances where the segmentation algorithm outputs two or more disjoint segments, does the inductive bias of the NeRF overcome this issue? (this is potentially addressed to some extent under the limitation mentioned by the authors about handling discontinuities).   \n  > e. Is a segmentation network required even if the model is on a plain background? (this is potentially the case, as the mask appears in equation (1)\n\n2. **Depth and Smoothness**: Similar to the above concern, the performance is capped by the effectiveness of the pre-trained depth and normal estimation network. This poses inherent limitations to the kind of input images that it can be applied to. Providing some insights on where these kind of estimation networks fail would be helpful. Furthermore, depth and normals potentially don't make much sense, till the NeRF has converged to a reasonably estimate of geometry.Is there a schedule associated with these losses to have an effect after initial shape has been estimated by the NeRF?\n\n3. **Centered objects**: Owing to the nature of Zero-1-to-3, it appears that this kind of lifting works only on centered objects. What is the effect on the recovered geometry if the object is off-center but can still be segmented out accurately ?\n\n4. **Textual inversion vs Dreambooth**: The authors mention that textual inversion is used for the 2D-SDS loss to capture some of the image specific texture information. Providing some insight on how this compares to performing Dreambooth on the model to achieve the same would be helpful."

The novel part of this work seems the combination of the text-conditioned SDS loss and image-conditioned SDS loss.

I do not find any specific weaknesses of this paper and followings are either limitations of current works or some design choices that can improve the results.\n\n1. Relightability.\nWhile this work uses a diffuse shading model, the reconstructed material texture is not really relightable and will have lighting baked in. To reconstruct relightable 3D contents, we need to understand the environment lighting of the input images and use that for optimization. However, how to do that from sparse view input is still an open problem.\n\n2. Reconstruction speed.\nThe reconstruction speed of the stage one may be improved by progressively increase the level of hashgrid and the resolution of the rendered image. The reconstruction speed of the second stage may be improved by sampling from a small range of time steps. \n\n3. Backside of the object.\nIn some examples, the backside of the object still has a strong color shift compared to the reference views.
