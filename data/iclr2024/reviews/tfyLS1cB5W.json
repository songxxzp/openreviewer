This is achieved by adding an HRR layer to the transformers found in BERT, allowing for the efficient processing of clinical diagnosis codes.\n\nEmpirical results indicate that the enhanced HRR-integrated BERT model delivers superior performance compared to its standard counterpart, particularly in the context of rare diseases."

This novel use of HRR in the context of deep learning for medical applications sets a new benchmark and opens up avenues for more sophisticated and nuanced models that could transform medical data analysis.\n\nQuality:\nThe research quality is commendably moderate, detailing the experimental procedures and significance testing methods. However, while it engages in beneficial discussions, there is room for deeper exploration and more rigorous analysis to elevate the robustness of the findings.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is well-structured, with a clear exposition of the problem, methodology, and results. The authors articulate the limitations of current transformer models in processing rare medical terms and effectively convey how their approach addresses these issues. The use of HRR is explained with sufficient detail to be understood by readers who may not be familiar with this representation method.  Particularly noteworthy is the authors' adept use of simple, relatable examples to elucidate the more abstract concepts involved, such as the Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR).

The manuscript could benefit from additional explanations of abbreviations such as \"SNOMED CT.\" A glossary or expanded definitions on first use would aid comprehension, especially for readers unfamiliar with the terminology.\n\n2. References to critical resources like the \"MIMIC-IV dataset\" are absent. Citing such resources would provide context and allow readers to assess the relevance and applicability of the data.\n\n3. Section 2.1 lacks detailed descriptions of dataset handling procedures, which is not reader-friendly for those not acquainted with the \"MIMIC-IV dataset.\" Providing more detail would enhance reproducibility and understanding.\n\n4. Section 2.2.1 does not adequately explain the rationale behind the chosen ICD mapping approach. Specifically, it is unclear why the authors did not map all ICD-10 codes directly to ICD-9 codes and subsequently to SNOMED CT, but rather employed the separate mapping method described. This decision is perplexing and warrants a thorough justification to understand the advantages or the necessity of the approach taken.\n\n5. The choice of employing a \"one-sided Dunnett\u2019s test\" in Section 3.2 is not substantiated with an explanation. It is essential for the authors to clarify this methodological decision, especially since the results in Table 1 suggest an overlap in the confidence intervals and a close proximity of mean values between the experimental and control groups. The absence of such a justification leaves readers questioning the appropriateness of the statistical test used in the analysis.\n\n6. While Section 3.3 commendably visualizes \"highly frequent codes\" and \"infrequent codes,\" the lack of separate predictive performance displays for these two categories in Table 1 is a missed opportunity. This differentiation is, after all, one of the paper's stated goals.\n\n7. Finally, the paper does not sufficiently discuss the limitations of the proposed method.

The manuscript frequently uses the abbreviation \"SNOMED CT\" without providing a full explanation or definition for readers who may be unfamiliar with the term. Could you please provide a brief description of \"SNOMED CT\" and its relevance to your work in the introduction or the first instance where it is mentioned?\n2. Dataset Citation:The \"MIMIC-IV dataset\" is a crucial element in your research, yet it lacks a proper citation or reference. Could you please add a citation for the dataset to allow readers to trace the source and potentially reproduce your study?\n3. Dataset Processing Details: In Section 2.1, the description of how the dataset was processed is somewhat brief. Providing a more detailed account of the preprocessing steps would be beneficial, especially for readers who are not familiar with the dataset. Could you elaborate on this process?\n4. Rationale Behind Mapping Method: Section 2.2.1 does not sufficiently explain the reasoning behind the chosen ICD mapping method. Why did you opt for the particular mapping approach used in the study instead of mapping all ICD-10 codes to ICD-9 codes, and then to \"SNOMED CT\"? Clarifying the rationale behind this decision would be helpful.\n5. The choice of a \"one-sided Dunnett\u2019s test\" in Section 3.2 requires further explanation. Could you elaborate on the reasons for selecting this test and whether your method adheres to the assumptions of the test? Additionally, if the decision to use Dunnett's test was deliberate, why opt for a one-sided test instead of a two-sided test? Do you have supporting rationale to support this test? The clarity on these points is crucial, especially in light of the overlapping confidence intervals and closely aligned mean values between the experimental and control groups as presented in Table 1.\n6. While the visualization of \"highly frequent codes\" and \"infrequent codes\" in Section 3.3 is commendable, the performance metrics under these two categories are not separately displayed in Table 1. Displaying results across various scenarios could effectively showcase the effectiveness of your approach, especially since addressing the representation of infrequent codes is one of your stated objectives. Could you include these performance metrics in your results?\n7. A discussion on the limitations of the proposed method is noticeably absent. An acknowledgement of potential limitations and constraints of your approach would provide a more balanced view and contribute to the paper\u2019s integrity.
