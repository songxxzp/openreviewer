                "value": "The paper deal with Multi-View Representation Learning and solves a problem which affects Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) approaches, which is the model collapse. Model Collapse occurs when the performance of DCCA-based methods drops with the advancements of the training epochs, and is due to the model correlation among neural networks. \nThe authors make a comparison with simple CCA (not deep) approaches, and demonstrate that the main reason for CCA not having the model collapse issue is that the full-rank property holds in its transformation matrix, while the DNNs in DCCA do not possess such property. In particular, CCA searches for as a full-rank matrix, and it is robust to random noise, given the fact that the correlations before and after the (linear ) projection is kept\nTherefore, the authors propose a noise regularization to enforce the DNNs to be \u201cfull-rank\u201d, tailored for DCCA-based methods, dubbed NR-DCCA. NR-DCCA generates a set of i.i.d Gaussian white noise, with the same shape as the multi-view data Xk. Subsequently, DCCA is enforced to be full rank by adding a Noise regularized loss which requires that the correlation between the raw data and the noise is kept after having embedded the data into a latent space with the deep network, for each of the view.\nExperiments on synthetic and real world datasets, against a set of SOTA approaches, show the validity of the simple idea of the authors"

Just a curiosity. \nIn general I think that the paper can be squeezed a little, in order to host some of the experiments of the additional material.

This phenomenon is characterized by a significant drop in performance as the training progresses. The model collapse issue poses a substantial challenge to the widespread adoption of DCCA-based methods, as it becomes difficult to determine the appropriate stopping point during training. To address this issue, the authors introduce NR-DCCA, which incorporates a novel noise regularization approach designed to prevent model collapse. Furthermore, they provide theoretical insights demonstrating that maintaining the full-rank property is essential for preventing model collapse, and the proposed noise regularization effectively enforces this property within the neural network. Additionally, they develop a framework for generating synthetic data containing various common and complementary information to facilitate a comprehensive comparison of Multiple View Representation Learning (MVRL) methods."

The choice of the optimal value for the hyperparameter \u03b1 in Equation 6 is crucial. If \u03b1 is set too large, the model may tend to behave like an identity mapping function, potentially reducing its effectiveness. Conversely, if \u03b1 is too small, the model may not maintain a \"full-rank\" property. The authors should provide guidance or suggestions on how to select an appropriate \u03b1 value.\n\nThe reviewer is interested in whether there is any theoretical analysis of the generalization ability of the proposed method. An exploration of how NR-DCCA's performance might extend to new, unseen data or domains would add depth to the paper.\n\nThe paper showcases the performance improvement of the proposed method in downstream tasks using off-the-shelf methods like Support Vector Regression (SVR). However, the reviewer is curious about whether there are any significant performance differences when fine-tuning the system using downstream tasks. An analysis of how NR-DCCA performs in this scenario would be informative."

In the original deep CCA paper [Andrew et al, 2013] there was already ridge regularization of the auto-covariance matrices (see their eqn 5) to avoid degeneracy and improve numerical stability. And that regularization technique was already studied for linear CCA, see\n- De Bie and De Moor. On the regularization of canonical correlation analysis, 2003.\nand an probabilistic interpretation where a Gaussian observation model leads to regularized covariance matrices\n- Bach and Jordan. A Probabilistic Interpretation of Canonical Correlation Analysis. 2005.\nWhile the authors' proposal appears different, it is still important to discuss the connections to existing methods and compare with them, both theoretically and empirically.\n\n2. The intuition behind the proposal is not super clear to me. If the goal is to have full-rank f(X), so that the covariances are better conditioned, the abovementioned covariance regularization approach already achieves the same effect. If I look at Proposition 4, it essentially says CCA is invariant to linear transformations of input; but this is well-known and easy to see from the original formulation, even without complicated linear algebra. The more interesting analysis would be to explain why the correlation between signal and random noise is a good quantity for deep neural networks to mimic; there must be more structure than saying that fk is full-rank in my opinion.\n\n3. The paper is not purely about optimization and numerical stability. And I expect to see different inductive bias from the proposed regularization. There shall be investigation of the feature quality on real-world datasets, as shown by prior deep CCA-based papers."
