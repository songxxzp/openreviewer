                "value": "This paper proposes a new variant of knowledge distillation called Transformed Teacher Matching (TTM) that drops temperature scaling on the student side and introduces an inherent regularization term. The paper shows that TTM leads to better generalization and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy performance. The paper also introduces a weighted version of TTM called Weighted Transformed Teacher Matching (WTTM) that enhances the student's capability to match the teacher's power transformed probability distribution. The experiments conducted in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of TTM and WTTM on various datasets and architectures."

This approach is motivated by recent works and is a departure from conventional knowledge distillation. The paper also introduces a weighted version of TTM that enhances the student's capability to match the teacher's power transformed probability distribution. These contributions are novel and have not been explored in previous works.\n\n2. The paper is well-written and presents a clear and concise description of the proposed methods. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the experimental results and compare their approach with state-of-the-art methods. The experiments are conducted on various datasets and architectures, which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods.\n\n3. The proposed methods have the potential to improve the performance of knowledge distillation and have practical applications in various domains. The paper demonstrates that TTM and WTTM achieve state-of-the-art accuracy performance on various datasets and architectures. The inherent regularization term in TTM also provides a new perspective on knowledge distillation and has the potential to inspire further research in this area. Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of knowledge distillation"

                "value": "1. The paper could benefit from addressing the lack of novelty by acknowledging that techniques such as R\u00b4enyi or f divergence, temperature scaling, and logits normalization have already been widely used in knowledge distillation. For example, Information Theoretic Representation Distillation (BMVC) employed R\u00b4enyi divergence for standard distillation, and AlphaNet (ICML2021) utilized the f divergence to distill different sub-networks. Moreover, this method is likely already considered in the distiller's search work (KD-Zero: Evolving Knowledge Distiller for Any Teacher-Student Pairs, NeurIPS-2023). \n\n2. To strengthen the paper's findings, it is important to validate the proposed method on downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. Including evaluation results on these tasks will demonstrate the practical effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method. Additionally, providing more examples and visualizations will enhance the readers' understanding of how the method works and its impact on the learning process.\n\n3. Furthermore, it is essential to incorporate a thorough discussion of relevant KD-related studies, including Self-Regulated Feature Learning via Teacher-free Feature Distillation (ECCV2022), NORM: Knowledge Distillation via N-to-One Representation Matching (ICLR2023), Shadow Knowledge Distillation: Bridging Offline and Online Knowledge Transfer (NIPS2022), DisWOT: Student Architecture Search for Distillation Without Training (CVPR2023), and Automated Knowledge Distillation via Monte Carlo Tree Search (ICCV2023). This discussion will help position the proposed approach within the existing literature, establish connections, and provide valuable insights for potential comparisons."
