Since the authors use the same topology for all the motifs, it would be good if the authors could elucidate how they chose this topology and what effect it has on the final architecture. I feel this notion of motifs is inspired by the blocks building the cells in the DARTS paper - if so, the DARTS method used a variety of different convolution layers for these blocks. It would be interesting if the authors could highlight why no such heterogeneity would be required in designing RSNNs.\n\n2. The SC-ML architecture seems very similar to the concept of clustered ESNs. Can you give some explanation of how this is similar/different?\n\nB. HYBRID RISK-MITIGATING ARCHITECTURAL SEARCH (HRMAS)\n\n1. The authors introduce the HRMAS as a bi-level optimization where, in the first step, they optimize $\\alpha$ and $w$ hierarchically, based on gradient-based optimization. In the second step, they use IP to adapt the parameters of each neuron over a time window. However, that does not match with the problem formulation in Eqs 1-3, where it seems the first-level optimization searches for the architecture, the second-level searches for the optimal  parameters, and the third level optimizes the weights\n\n2. The authors repeatedly mention the \u201crisks\u201d caused by the change in the first level of the bi-level optimization. It would be good if the authors were more specific and showed a more complete ablation study of what happens if they do not use this IP optimization.\n\n3. It seems the gradient-based optimization is simply the DARTS method - it would be good if the authors could highlight the novelty of the architecture search method and how they are optimized for spiking neural networks and the neuronal timescales (as they mentioned in the abstract and introduction) Right now, it seems the architecture search is an off the shelf implementation of the DARTS bi-level optimization problem.\n\n4. Since this is an architecture search process, it would be recommended that the authors also add the following results:\n       a. performance comparison with random weights/architecture (this should be the baseline)\n       b. the complexity of the algorithm - like how long it took to run these simulations and how the performance changes over the iterations of the optimization problem\n\n5. The authors propose this method can be used to design very large RSNN models. The results in Table 1 show the size is comparable to current RSNN models. It would be interesting if the authors could give more results on what happens if the number of neurons increases.\n\n6. From Figure 6, it seems the final model is a densely connected model compared to many of the current methods. As mentioned before, an important ablation study would be to compare with a randomly generated model (normally these models are much sparsely connected). If there is a significant difference, it would be interesting to know why such dense connections are important for better performance\n\n7. From my personal experiences, such architecture search models are extremely unstable and highly dependent on the initializations. Can you add some details on the initialization you used for your experiments and whether two different initialization models converge to similar or very different models?  It is also important that the authors rerun the experiments a few times (with same/different initializations) and report the mean and variance of the performance in Table 1."

Analogous to a cell in the NASNet search space, they defined a sparse connected motif layer (SC-ML). A recurrent spiking neural network is formed by stacking several of these SC-ML layers. The SC-ML layer has N motifs where each motif is comprised of recurrent spiking neurons of a fixed size. The neurons within a motif and between two motifs are connected using excitatory, inhibitory and non-existent connections. Further, in order to reduce the number of recurrent connections, a motif is restricted to be connected to only its neighboring motif rather than any N-1 motifs in the layer. \n    In the search step, the algorithm finds the optimal motif size, the intra-motif and the inter-motif connection types. They designed a supernet which has all possible motif sizes and the intra-motif/inter-motif connection types. For intra-motif connections, a connection matrix similar to an adjacency matrix determines the kind of connection between neuron i and j.  Similar to DARTS, the motif sizes and the connection types are relaxed to form continuous probability predictions. A gradient optimization based bi-level optimization algorithm is used to perform the search, where the architecture parameters and the neural network weights are optimized alternately. In addition to that at every step, SPiKL-IP based intrinsic plasticity is used to adapt the spiking neurons to the changing network weights and the architecture weights. Upon convergence, the discretization step is performed  to obtain the best RSNN architecture. \n     They evaluated the search algorithm on 3 datasets."

Like you pointed out, the validation loss of the continuous representation is lower than the discretized version. So several works such as RobustDarts (that was cited in your papaer) suggested various regularization techniques to alleviate it. Similar to Robust Darts, can you also empirically show what the validation loss before and after descretization is? How does using SpiKL-IP influence it?\n4.
