Limitations:\n- The proposed method is limited: The proposed attack method is specific to superFT which adopt a cyclical learning rate scheme. It is not clear whether other defense methods are equally effective, such as ANP [1]. I believe adopting a cyclical learning rate scheme is not a proper choice for inserting backdoors. The main reason is that it is very hard for attackers to tune its hyperparameters. The authors do not provide any details about how to choose parameters for this cyclical learning rate scheme. I also notice that the authors only evaluate ResNet models. Do we need different hyperparameters on different models?\n- As mentioned in above point, the authors do not evaluate other pruning-based methods like ANP [1] and RNP [2]. I think the author need to evaluate these defense methods to show effectiveness of proposed attack method. \n- Comparsions with existing advanced backdoor attacks: [3] proposed more stealthy and robust backdoor attacks without controlling training process. And, I also strongly suggest that the authors should evaluate more diverse attack settings like lower poisoning rate (1%).\n\n2. Lacking of ture explanations: The intuition behind proposed method is too hauristic. Apart from evaluation of ASR, the authors do not provide any evaluation about proposed hypothesis. Actually, we are not sure whether it leads to more flat and stable minimum with inserted triggers. The author could provide loss landscape analysis to verify this point.  \nI think the authors are not familiar with loss landscape anaysis of DNN models. Adopting a cyclical learning rate scheme can not gaurantee searching a flat and stable local min. We could adopt SWA [4] to achieve this goal. \n\n[1] Adversarial Neuron Pruning Purifies Backdoored Deep Models.  \n[2] Reconstructive Neuron Pruning for Backdoor Defense.   \n[3] Revisiting the Assumption of Latent Separability for Backdoor Defenses.  \n[4] Averaging Weights Leads to Wider Optima and Better Generalization."

The related work section can be expanded. Although the article has listed some related works, there are other important works in the field of backdoor attacks that can be referenced. In addition, I would like to know the rationale or justification for choosing these seven attack methods as representative methods. It is not possible for the authors to exhaust all the attack methods and prove the enhancement of backdoor persistence by the method, but I think representative methods need to be chosen to prove the comprehensiveness of the experiments.\n3. Results of other defense experiments. Although the authors compare many fine-tuning-based defense methods to prove the effectiveness of the proposed backdoor, I am still concerned about whether the existing attack methods are able to overcome the existing backdoor defense methods, such as data cleansing methods, model modification methods, and model validation methods.\n4. Analysis of defense strategies. Considering the potential threat of backdoor attacks, it is recommended that the authors discuss possible defense strategies or propose corresponding challenges in their articles."

The experimental results are not 100% convincing.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\nI like this paper showing (or re-confirming) that fine-tuning cannot be an effective defense against backdoor attacks. Even if there are manuscripts making bold claims like \"fine-tuning is effective,\" I don't believe that it is the case: their positive results are coming either (1) from running fine-tuning with longer epochs or large learning rates (often) or (2) from an adversary unaware of their fine-tuning methods.\n\nSo, I am a bit positive to have this paper as empirical evidence showing that existing claims are not based on a concrete security analysis.\n\n----\n\nHowever, we also know that fine-tuning cannot be a defense; a vast literature on backdoor attacks evaluated fine-tuning and confirmed that it is ineffective (note that it is not against this advanced fine-tuning). We already have a skepticism about fine-tuning. \n\nSo, on the other hand, it is less scientifically interesting to prove that we already know with empirical evaluation. I am a bit confident that even if the two prior works are out to the community, no one will believe that fine-tuning can become an effective countermeasure.\n\n----\n\nI also find that the paper puts a lot of effort into emphasizing fine-tuning as a defense seriously considered in the community. But it often gives an incorrect view of the prior work, which I want the authors fixing them before this manuscript will be out to the community.\n\nFor example, papers like NeuralCleanse do not consider fine-tuning as a primary mean to defeat backdoors. The key idea was to \"reconstruct\" the trigger from a set of assumptions about backdooring adversaries. Once we know what was used as a backdoor trigger, the fine-tuning is a natural next step to \"unlearn\" the backdoor behaviors. It is not the same as one uses fine-tuning without knowing the trigger, which should be addressed and fixed in the paper. \n\nI found more like this in the introduction and backdoor defense section.\n\n----\n\nFinally, sometimes fine-tuning reduces their attack's success rate. This (as-is) can be shown as the effectiveness of fine-tuning (as at least the success rate has been decreased). \n\nTo be a more concrete claim, the results have to be compared with a baseline. What would be the baseline? The cases where we reduce the attack success rate to 50%? It was not clear in the paper; therefore, the claims discussing the effectiveness of fine-tuning can also be controversial ---even if I don't believe that fine-tuning works.\n\n----\n\nAt the moment, I am slightly leaning toward rejecting this paper. But if those concerns are (and will also be) addressed in the responses, I will be happy to bump up my assessment."
