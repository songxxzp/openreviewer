PPO-MCTS is 2S times slower due to the tree construction, where S is the number of simulations ...\". It is questionable that this method can be used in practice.\n\nIn addition, the current experiments are not quite convincing, as explained below.\n* In section B.1, \"Compared to the original training settings in Lu et al. (2022), we turn off reward whitening and adaptive KL coefficient, \u2026\", and in section B.2 \"Compared to the original training settings, we turn off reward whitening and adaptive KL coefficient, \u2026\". This shows that the authors use different training settings for the baseline model, which leads to different performances. In Table 3, the PPO (Liu et al, 2022) result is evaluated by the author. However, the performance (average QA accuracy) is lower than the reference (58.69 vs. 60.36). The performance in (Liu et al, 2022) is even higher than PPO-MCTS.\n* In Table 1, \"PPO (4x more steps)\" outperforms \"PPO\" (75.50 vs. 52.44), and the result is getting close to PPO-MCTS. Does \"PPO (4x more steps)\" converge? Why not try more steps for PPO, e.g. PPO (8x more steps)? In addition, how is the performance of PPO(4x more steps)-MCTS?\n* Since the PPO-MCTS is much slower than PPO, it would be better to evaluate PPO-MCTS with 1-50 simulations instead of only 10, 20, and 50 simulations. This result can provide readers with a tradeoff between performance and evaluating time."

                "value": "Most of the important results with the MCTS algorithm have been achieved in combination with off-policy RL algorithms. In those instances both the policy and value outputs are used by MCTS. When PPO is used standalone, the value output is not needed anymore, but as noted in the paper, it is useful when PPO is combined with MCTS. However, in the view of the well known results with off-policy RL algorithms, this is hardly surprising.\n\nIn the presentation of the new MCTS, there are some alteration highlighted. I am not sure of the novelty of most of these changes.\n\n- \"replacing V with Q\": even the original UCT paper defined the problem as MDP, with non-terminal rewards included. Using Q(s,a) is much more standard than V(s), which has an after-state flavor. Using the KL penalty term as (or in the) reward seems a bit odd. It is steering the search toward the original policy, which may not be a bed thing, but it is already done by the use of prior in equation (3). The KL term is not vanishing with additional search, which means that the MCTS algorithm does not converge asymptotically to an optimal action. \n\n- \"initializing Q with V\": this is probably the standard way of using value functions in MCTS\n\n- \"Forbidding node expansion after terminal states\": this is just the normal thing to do. Probably, there is no MCTS implementation that would expand the tree beyond a terminal state.\n\nThe backup rule, as defined looks somewhat strange. The update (5) leads to NaN if any of of the child nodes (s') is not yet sampled (N(s')=0). The usual backup rule is to update it with the return from the current trace. Maybe it is happening here as well, but it is awkwardly written. It would be useful to describe the algorithm with a pseudocode, so that similar issues can be clarified better."

                "value": "My first criticism regards the name of the submission and method. I'm not totally in agreement that the submission is about \"Making PPO Better\". The submission is about using MCTS to better align the model's output with human feedback. That the value function comes from PPO in particular seems not very material to the actual contribution of the submission. I also find the name PPO-MCTS somewhat misleading. To me, this evokes a method that combines PPO and MCTS in the spirit of PG Search (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03646) or RL Search (https://openreview.net/forum?id=D0xGh031I9m), which is not what the submission intends to convey. It would be more clear to label the approach PPO+MCTS.\n\nMy second criticism regards the submission's claims of novelty regarding MCTS, which I repeat below:\n\n> 1. Replacing the edge values V with the Q-function to ensure consistency with PPO training.\n\nI found the description of (1) given in the introduction somewhat unclear, but the description is clarified under equation (3), where the text states:\n\n```\nNote that this is different from the standard MCTS algorithm, where V(s\u2032) is directly used in\nplace of Q(s, a) in Equation 3. We refer to this change as replacing V with Q. We made this\nchange because, in the standard MCTS setup, the reward is given only to the terminal step (i.e.,\nintermediate steps are assumed a zero reward), and there is no discounting horizon (\u03b3), and thus\nthe return is always equal to the final reward. However, in PPO, intermediate steps are penalized\nwith a KL term (Equation 1), and there is a discounting factor \u03b3 when computing the return\n(Equation 2). We use the version in Equation 3 to faithfully capture this regularization term.\n```\nThis is not novel -- it was actually the original formulation of MCTS. See *Bandit based Monte-Carlo Planning* (Kocsis and Szepesvari, 2006), which I notice the submission neglects to cite.\n\n> 2. Initializing the Q of children actions from the V of their parent node to encourage exploration.\n\nI'm not sure I understand why this is important. The submission states\n```\nWe made this change because with PPO models, the Q can have rather\nlarge scales (in the order of 10s), due to reasons that will be explained in \u00a7A.4. During early\nexperiments, we found that this can severely suppress exploration in the tree search, making it\ndegenerate to greedy decoding.\n```\nThis explanation doesn't make sense. The scale of Q should not matter. As far as argmaxing equation (3), any increase in the scale of Q can be mitigated by an increase in the scale of c_puct.\n\n> 3. Forbidding exploration after terminal states.\n\n```\nForbidding node expansion after terminal states. Text generation usually stops at a terminal\ntoken, [EOS]. When the action is [EOS], the child node is called a terminal node. Node expansion\nafter terminal states should be forbidden, because evaluation on states after a terminal node has\nundefined behavior. To maintain proper visit counts up to the terminal node, when encountering a\nterminal node in the select stage, we should not stop the simulation early, but jump directly to the\nbackup stage\n```\nThis is not novel -- it's standard practice. See open source MCTS implementation: https://github.com/google-deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/algorithms/mcts.h#L187-L191\n\n---\n\nMy third criticism is structural. The submission's method section mostly just explains MCTS. But MCTS is not new methodology from the paper -- it's background material. The submission should describe MCTS as background material in the preliminaries section. The methodology section should just explain how the submission applies MCTS in its specific context. It's ok if the methodology section is short.\n\n---\n\nI also had this comment.\n\n> Following Chaffin et al. (2021), we do not do Monte-Carlo rollout due to efficiency considerations.\n\nThis isn't an appropriate citation for not doing Monte Carlo rollouts for efficiency considerations. Using a value function instead of Monte Carlo rollouts is common practice going back at least to AlphaGo Zero."

                "value": "The main weakness of the paper is the missing comparison axis of efficiency in the paper and the baselines it therefore decides to evaluate against. The fundamental issue is that RLHF is only used because it is a more efficient alternative to best-of-n decoding with a reward model. As shown in [Gao et al (2022)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10760) as well as [Stiennon et al (2020)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01325) just decoding $n$ samples from a model and choosing the best one using a reward model (\"best-of-n\") is as performant as RLHF and closer in KL to the original model. The reason this method isn't used is because it can require incredibly high $n$ and be computationally infeasible at scale. This paper proposes to do a computationally expensive method after training without really tackling the issue of computational cost. At minimum, the authors need to show how their method performs across different computation scales (values of $S$) and compare it to PPO, PPO+best-of-n, as well as best-of-n without PPO. The goal should be to give practitioners an idea of the computation/performance tradeoff of this method. The only results on a large-scale task, HH-RLHF, don't seem to be very strong which casts some doubt on the efficacy.\n\n### evaluation and baselines\n\ngiven the relative simplicity of the idea, I think there need to be more baselines that are convincing that 1. the value model is necessary and 2. that MCTS is the best way to use it\n\nFor 1. the existing experiment doing MCTS with a reward model is a good start but is not fully convincing\n- best-of-n (with/wihout) PPO using the reward model\n\nFor 2. beam search is a much more popular decoding method\n- beam search \n- beam search using the value model\n\nThese seem a bare minimum to me, especially when there is a large literature on language model decoding. For comparison, [Leblond et al (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05336.pdf) which the authors note is very related to their own work compared to all of the above as well as greedy decoding and MCTS with rollouts\n\n### minor issues\n\nthe authors seem to imply that they have a novelty in MCTS by using a Q-value instead of a Value but if I'm not mistaken, this formulation is used by Leblond et al (2021) \n\none reasons given for the trick is also not applicable: though PPO does technically use a discount factor, it is generally set to 1 for LM decoding with a maximum length output as is done in RLHF\n\nusing only the training reward to measure performance of RLHF in the HH task is insufficient, it should be accompanied by a metric of KL from the initial model\n\ndespite having four tasks, only one of these HH, is related to the general tasks that RLHF is used for nowadays and there is a single evaluation of reward and a single note on relative performance with human comparisons. This is not sufficient\n\n### stylistic\n\nIn general, the paper spends too much time on introduction, explaining existing ideas (e.g MCTS) and notation. For example, Paragraph 4 describing Figure 1 in detail is unnecessary and should really be captured by the caption.\n\nSection 2.3 does not describe PPO but actor-critic methods in general, this is perfectly fine but should not be titled PPO."

                "value": "The main issues preventing me from recommending acceptance is evaluations that take into account efficiency and the baselines showing that both the value model and MCTS are necessary. I would recommend acceptance if the authors can demonstrate \n- in which computational regimes their method outperforms best-of-n with/without PPO using the reward model\n- those + beam search baselines on at least one benchmark (e.g. toxicity reduction would be sufficient)\n\n\n### clarification\n\nWhy do you use nucleus sampling in HH\n- This seems like an important choice and previous work seems to be just using regular sampling or greedy decoding\n\nWhat exactly is PPO+best-of-n?\n- Are you decoding $n$ samples and then choosing the best sample according to a reward model? \n- If so, why are you using the value model instead of the reward model?\n\nWhy are your Fluency numbers so different from the original results in Quark?\n\nWhy do you remove the adaptive KL coefficient from experiments? It has been an important part of PPO performance and as long as you keep track of the final value, you shouldn't need to approximate Q with V, correct?"
