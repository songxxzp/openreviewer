The authors suggest that minimal performance degradation post-merging should be studied in the evaluation part. While I agree minimal degradation is a necessary condition, it is not sufficient: given that the final model performs the same tasks as CM3leon, improving only 1.4 PPL points does not justify the necessity of jointly training with a text LLM."

The authors also conduct ablation studies to better understand the three approaches they have proposed. Empirically, the authors show the feasibility of fusing two decoders from multiple modalities.\n\nThe authors collect a small and curated mixed-modal dataset for the purpose of multimodal conversational instruction tuning, and also confirmed that training with interleaved image-text data is beneficial."

This is acceptable as this work is not focusing on reasoning and understanding.\n\nOn Scaling up: \n\nCompared to GPT-3, the JAM model is still pretty small. Scaling up the model size could potentially help with the performance in terms of common sense reasoning and also generation.\u00a0\n\nSingle image generation:\n\n Interleaved generation is one innovation of this work. By reading the decoding strategies, it seems that one single image will be sampled if <break> token is detected, and then the model will continue text generation unless the <eos> token is sampled. By looking at all the samples provided, it seems that this is the case.One possibility is that there could be multiple text requests to generate multiple images at once."
