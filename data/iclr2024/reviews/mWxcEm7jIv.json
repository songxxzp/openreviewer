                "value": "The paper introduces Denoising-Assisted (DA) classifiers in the domain of classifier-guided diffusion models to enhance both conditional and unconditional generation tasks. The DA classifiers are trained using both noisy and denoised examples, unlike traditional diffusion classifiers trained only on noisy data. Through experiments on CIFAR10 and Imagenet datasets, the authors demonstrate that DA classifiers exhibit better generalization to unseen data and improved perceptual alignment of classifier-gradients, leading to enhanced image generation. The paper also theoretically analyzes the gradients of DA-classifiers to explain the observed improvements. Additionally, a semi-supervised framework is proposed to leverage the generalization strengths of DA-classifiers in scenarios with limited labeled data. The empirical and analytical discussions included in the paper provide a thorough understanding of the improvements DA-classifiers bring over noisy classifiers, showing promise in advancing the performance of generative models."

Specifically, the formatting of equations (5) and (6) spanning across three rows appears to be cluttered and may benefit from a more concise representation.\n  \n2. The paper primarily focuses on one-step denoising, which raises the question of why multi-step denoising to reach time step t=0 was not explored. Utilizing the sample at time step t=0 as input to the classifier could potentially offer additional insights or improvements, and it would be beneficial for the authors to discuss or explore this aspect.\n  \n3. The core contribution of employing the denoised sample as input to a classifier may come across as straightforward. The paper could benefit from a clearer articulation of the motivation behind this choice and the specific problems it aims to address. While the one-step denoised sample is utilized, the rationale behind not exploring [x, one-step denoised sample, two-step denoised sample] as inputs could use further clarification. Although the authors provide some explanations, a more robust justification could enhance the perceived significance of the work.\n  \n4. The discussion on the semi-supervised learning framework introduces an idea of selecting pseudo-label data based on confidence thresholds during the diffusion process. However, the motivation behind this choice could be better elucidated. It may be worth exploring or explaining why traditional uncertainty measures in the raw data space were deemed insufficient, and how the proposed method addresses any identified limitations."

While they mention that these methods are complementary, it would be beneficial to present their performance results, similar to how standard semi-supervised discriminative models are presented in Table 3. In addition, the authors should extend the application of DA classifiers to these methods and report the results to demonstrate the orthogonal nature of their work.\n\n2. Missing generation results in semi-supervised settings\n\nThere is no FID and IS results for generated images in semi-supervised settings. They only said that \"FID and IS metrics are similar to the results described in Table 2\". Since the main task of this paper could be seen as conditional image generation, these experimental results are crucial evidence to assess the effectiveness of their method.\n\n3. Classifier-free guidance in semi-supervised training\n\nThe authors mentioned that semi-supervised training of a classifier-free model is not easy to implement, citing the original paper's recommendation for the supervised settings. It is important to empirically verify this claim, as there is a lack of evidence on for the feasibility and effectiveness of classifier-free models in partial label settings.\n\n4. Clarification of the sampling procedure\n\nSince the primary objective of this paper is image generation, it would be beneficial to provide a detailed procedure or algorithm for sample generation using the proposed method. Actually, the utilization of DA classifiers in sample generation is not straightforward, given the difference in gradient computation between $\\nabla_x \\log p(y|x,t)$ and $\\frac{d \\log p(y|x,\\hat{x},t)}{dx}$.
