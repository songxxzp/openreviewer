In training time, the diffusion model learns the joint distribution of the audio mixture and solves the three tasks using different inference methods. Audio generation is done via directly sampling the prior. Source inputation is done using the inpainting technique in diffusion models. The source separation is a tailored method: reconstructing audio signals under the constraint that audio mixture is the summation of each audio tracks. Experiment results show the model is successful in all three tasks."

Of course the current work is novel but it would be better to include those studies and compare the approaches in related work.\n2. What is the novelty compared to NCSN-BASIS? Any intuition for MSDM Dirac? Is it a marginal improvement from existing methods, or not?\n3. The introduction of ISDM method is not clear. Is it a baseline method where the assumptions are obviously wrong? Is it another valid approach? Compared to MSDM, is there a trade-off in terms of generation quality and separation performance?\n4. The introduction of correction step is okay. Since it is evaluated in the experiment section, could you explain more in the paper? What is the statement to be expected prior to the experiment regarding correction step?\n\n[1] Liwei Lin, Gus Xia, Qiuqiang Kong, Junyan Jiang: A unified model for zero-shot music source separation, transcription and synthesis.

However, since MSDM is always lower than ISDM, I doubt the fundamental assumption in this paper is not valid that it is superior to use joint distribution to model generation and separation at the same time.\n\nQ2: Could you provide some demos for ISDM method (Now or after publication)?"

Modeling multiple sources jointly allows the system to perform source imputation / accompaniment generation by conditioning on a partial mixture during inference. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of MDSM in both source separation and generation tasks, achieving separation performance competitive with state-of-the-art models. Moreover, by modeling sources independently and introducing a novel score function, the authors achieve separation results surpassing the state-of-the-art for certain instrument classes. While generation and imputation abilities appear to be more limited, MSDM demonstrates the strong potential of generative separation systems that model sources jointly."

Given recent advances in generative source separation and the apparent benefits of iterative refinement for separation [1], a diffusion-based approach seems natural.\n\nThe proposed method achieves very good separation performance using mostly off-the-shelf components, demonstrating the strength of the general approach. Additional improvements (e.g. weakly-supervised ISDM variant and Dirac score function) are well motivated in the paper.\n\nThe problem of source imputation / accompaniment generation is more relevant to many music creation workflows than full mixture generation, and is comparatively under-studied. While the accompaniment generation results here don't necessarily \"improve\" on those demonstrated in the referenced concurrent work [2] in terms of realism, the proposed method approaches the problem from a different angle (joint source separation and generation, diffusion rather than language modeling) and allows for more fine-grained control using multiple conditioning instrument classes (as opposed to singing only).\n\n[1] Ethan Manilow, Curtis Hawthorne, Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang, Bryan Pardo, and Jesse Engel.

Presumably separation time is linear in the number of inference steps (plus correction); it would be nice to see this explicitly compared to Demucs with and without Gibbs sampling. Similarly, if the proposed method is more data-hungry than discriminative methods such as Demucs (e.g. if the proposed method is not competitive when trained/evaluated on MUSDB), this might be worth emphasizing further. Parameter counts for each method would also be nice to see.\n\nBased on the listener study and provided listening examples, MSDM struggles to produce coherent and high-quality generations -- even when judged in the context of its synthetic training data. To my ears, it seems like tempo sometimes degrades within the model's 12-second context for unconditional generations, and for imputation generations when strongly metric signals (drums, bass) are not given as conditioning. Overall, the separation results seem much stronger than the generation results."

Could the authors elaborate on these results, and perhaps conjecture as to why independently modeling sources with ISDM improves (or at least does not substantially deteriorate) performance versus jointly modeling with MSDM?\n\nGiven the apparently high data requirements of MSDM, have the authors explored fine-tuning the Slakh2100 model on smaller datasets (e.g. MUSDB)? The authors mention potentially using the outputs of a source separation system to scale up the dataset (akin to SingSong), but fine-tuning also seems like an interesting avenue to explore -- especially given its popularity with diffusion models more generally.\n\nDid the authors conduct any separation or generation experiments with out-of-distribution data?"
