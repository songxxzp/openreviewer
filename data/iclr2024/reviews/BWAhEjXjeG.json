Then, it provides two tricks to improve the efficiency of the prediction sets. The first involves a general pipeline to modify the conformity score. The second is re-training the base model by mimicking the conformal prediction steps. The results suggest that the final method works better than the RSCP baseline."

In Section 4, the paper points out that RSCP and RSCP+ is conservative: RSCP gives a larger prediction set on both clean and perturbed data; this conservativeness then passes on to RSCP+, as supported by Table 1 and Table 2. However, the complementary results in Appendix I don't strongly indicates RSCP is conservative: for example, on Cifar-10, RSCP generates prediction sets of average size 2.751 based on APS.
