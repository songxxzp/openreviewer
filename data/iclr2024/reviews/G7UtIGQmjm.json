So this paper is more like revisiting self-debug from a different perspective, which limits its novelty and contribution. This paper also misses an important citation[2].\nExperiments results are not sufficient to justify the significance of the method. Of the 3 datasets used in the paper, the proposed method only works on ARC and 1D-ARC, which are very similar. Besides, it only uses 40 samples for inference and the variance of the performance is not reported. It is likely the observation in this paper may be overestimated due to variance in performance and model selection.\nThe contribution of this paper is not very clear. From the intro, it looks like the authors try to solve the inductive reasoning problem. From the experiments, there is no comparison with non-LLM baselines, and it looks more like an ablation study of using natural language hypotheses in program synthesis.\n\n[1] Chen, et al.

ARC: In Table 2, the accuracy with human-selected and human-written hypotheses are both 37.5. Does this mean model-generated hypotheses for each task almost always contain a correct one? Or is it the case that model-generated hypotheses sometimes have mistakes but, when correct, leads to better programs, and thus both 37.5? Can you evaluate the recall of model-generated hypotheses, either by some automatic metric or human evaluation?\n1.

                "value": "The paper addresses the challenge of inductive reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Directly prompting by in-context learning may not be able to solve complex tasks. The authors propose a novel approach inspired by the Bayesian rule that involves generating explicit hypotheses in natural language and then translating them into concrete Python programs, which can be verified. This approach, tested on tasks like ARC, 1D-ARC, and SyGuS, significantly improves LLMs' performance. By combining abstract reasoning with programmatic logic, and filtering hypotheses through LLM summaries or human annotators, the method demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving up to 37.5% accuracy on ARC, compared to a 12.5% baseline. The paper highlights the synergy between natural language processing and programmatic approaches in enhancing LLM inductive reasoning."

This approach creatively combines the strengths of natural language processing and programmatic logic, offering a unique solution to the challenge of inductive reasoning in complex tasks.\n2. The paper stands out for its robust methodology and the quality of its experimental results. The authors thoroughly test their approach on challenging datasets like ARC, demonstrating significant improvements in LLM performance. The ablation studies further substantiate the quality of the research, clarifying the contributions of each component of the proposed method.\n3. The presentation is good with clarity, presenting complex ideas and methodologies in a comprehensible manner. This clarity enhances the paper's accessibility to a broad audience, which is crucial for disseminating innovative ideas."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. While the method of generating and implementing hypotheses as Python programs is innovative, it may pose scalability challenges. For instance, generating a large number of hypotheses for complex problems could be computationally intensive and time-consuming. Moreover, the filtering process\u2014whether automated or human-assisted\u2014might not efficiently narrow down to the most effective hypotheses. To improve, the authors could explore more sophisticated algorithms for hypothesis generation that prioritize efficiency and scalability, possibly through more advanced heuristics or machine learning techniques.\n2. The paper demonstrates success in specific datasets like ARC, 1D-ARC, and SyGuS, but it's unclear how well this method generalizes to other types of inductive reasoning tasks, particularly those with differing structures or complexity levels, or even cannot be solved with python programs. Also, the baselines are limited only with direct prompting and ablated baselines, with no baselines from related works. In other words, the range of experimental tasks presented is somewhat limited, potentially restricting the scope of the paper\u2019s conclusions.\n3. The hypothesis proposal and selection process is essentially a search problem. The proposed iterative sampling and verification process is costly and inefficient from the perspective of search. The authors could consider more advanced search methods, such as DFS/BFS/MSTC, etc. Get some inspiration from the recent tree search prompting literature, like Tree-of-thoughts, reasoning-via-planning, etc."
