The method, named CR-OSRS, uses a joint Gaussian distribution to construct a smoothed model and searches for the optimal smoothing range that balances the trade-off between certified robustness and matching performance. The paper also introduces a data augmentation technique and a regularization term to improve the model performance during training. The paper provides theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of the proposed method on two GM datasets and four GM solvers."

Clarity is needed on the efficiency and scalability of this algorithm, especially in the context of larger-scale problems.\n- The literature review on graph matching and its robustness omits references to recent works on noisy correspondence in graph matching [2], which is closely related to the issue of adversarial attacks.\n- It is advisable to conduct a comparison between the proposed method and other existing techniques for robust GM, such as ASAR[1] and COMMON [2]. Specifically, COMMON addresses robust graph matching by considering noisy correspondence during training, while ASAR takes adversarial attacks into account during training. Evaluating these methods alongside CR-OSRS would provide more comprehensive experimental insights. Furthermore, reporting the certified accuracy and average certified radius for these models is encouraged.\n- Since the author outlines four challenges in the Introduction, it would be beneficial to emphasize these points within the Method section, using C1 to C4."

Practical techniques such as output space partitioning based on similarity, data augmentation, and a similarity-based regularization term are also presented.
