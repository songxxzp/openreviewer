                "value": "The paper introduces SYMBOL, a novel approach for BBO that leverages a neural network trained via Reinforcement Learning to dynamically predict the explicit expression of the optimization steps for a given task. \n\nSYMBOL is based on a Symbolic Equation Generator (SEG), an LSTM-based model responsible for predicting closed-form (symbolic) optimization updates. SEG can be trained via three different RL strategies, namely Exploration learning (SYMBOL-E), Guided learning (SYMBOL-G) and Synergized learning (SYMBOL-S). While SYMBOL-E does not impose any inductive bias about the sought-for optimizer,  SYMBOL-E explicitly forces the SEG to mimic the behaviour of a given black-box optimizer (teacher optimizer). SYMBOL-S integrates both approaches and regulates their relative importance via a hyperparameter $\\lambda$. \n\nThe model -- in all its three variants -- is extensively tested and compared to multiple state-of-the-art baselines. The results indicate that SYMBOL compares favourably to the considered baselines. In addition, the updates found by SEG can be directly inspected thanks to their symbolic nature."

This makes the applicability of the aforementioned training strategies relatively limited. \n\n- Reliance on the meta-learning stage: The training of the SEG model requires the selection of a training distribution D. The authors rely on 10 BBO optimization problems to construct D. However, in practice, the obtained distribution might not be large enough to guarantee sufficient generalization to fundamentally different tasks. \n\n- Training SYMBOL is still quite computationally demanding as shown in the meta-test column in Table 1. Is training the model via RL the computational bottleneck?"

There are only 3 operators and 7 operands in its basic symbol set, is the design of the symbol set relevant to the teacher algorithm?\n2. It is good to see the improvement in the experiment, however, I note SYMBOL-E does not outperform MadDe (2 out of 3 columns). This raises the question of whether the potential of SYMBOL is largely limited by the performance of MadDe. If MadDe does not work well, can the exploration reward actually help the model learn a much better update rule? The authors could try to use a relatively bad baseline as the teacher to verify this and or find a challenging task where MadDe does not work well."
