                "value": "The paper introduces a vector-field-based generative model (incorporating ODE/SDE mechanisms) capable of generating samples from multiple marginal distributions. The methodology pivots around a generalized form of stochastic interpolant, specifically a barycentric stochastic interpolant. The stochastic process, in this context, is formulated as a weighted mix of samples from distinct marginal distributions. These weights, restricted to the simplex, allow the model to generate a weighted combination, defined as $x(\\alpha)=\\sum_{k=0}^K x_k \\alpha_k$, where $\\alpha=\\left(\\alpha_0, \\ldots, \\alpha_K\\right) \\in \\Delta^K$. The corresponding probability flows are derived for this multi-weight interpolant path. To identify the optimal path with the lowest transport cost, the model is trained to minimize the Wasserstein-2 metric, considering the path's velocities. Consequently, this learned model allows transitions between various marginal distributions following the optimized path. However, the semantic interpretation of these paths, especially between distributions like images from multiple modes, remains ambiguous. In the experiments,"

Also, what does multi-marginal optimal transport path mean for image generation? Does it lead to better quality? In this paper, it is not answered.\n- *Unknown Utility*: There's a lack of clarity on the potential use-cases for this generative model. For instance, if it's geared towards style transfer, it's essential to determine which style gets preserved and how it compares with existing baselines in that domain.\n- *Novelty*: The novelty of doing stochastic interpolant for multiple marginal distributions is limited given that it is done for the two marginal case. The theoretical result seems to be an extension from the two marginal case to the multi-marginal case as well.\n- *Minor*: missing caption for Figure 2 (right)."

Right now, I am struggling to understand what is the use case especially for images when there is not a well-defined joint distribution between the multiple marginals.\n- It is unclear to me what is the implication of the Monge type coupling theoretical result. Is this shown to be relevant to the experimental results? If not I would recommend it to be put in appendix. It is also worth explaining more about the what this result implies and when we would like to have this property."
