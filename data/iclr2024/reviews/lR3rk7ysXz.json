The reviewer has thoroughly reviewed the experimental results presented in the appendix.

With this keen insight, the manuscript provides detailed derivation of the posterior distribution of variance of time (decided by time step) given an input image assumed to be produced by a diffusion process. Based on the derivation, the manuscript designs one non-parametric model and two parametric models (regressive and categorical respectively). \n\nThe performances of the three models are evaluated on 57 datasets from ADBench demonstrating the capabilities of DTE for the task of anomaly detection and its advantages over DDPM in quaility and efficacy."
