                "value": "This paper aims to design better provably imitation learning (IL) algorithms in discounted linear MDP. In discounted linear MDP, the existing provably IL method PPIL ignores the exploration issue and thus requires the persistent excitation assumption. This paper presents a new method ILARL which is free of such an assumption. In particular, the key to removing such an assumption is the reduction of IL to online optimization with adversarial losses. With this reduction, the target becomes to design a provably RL algorithm in adversarial MDPs. To achieve this goal, this paper first presents an algorithm in the finite-horizon adversarial MDPs and then extends it to the infinite-horizon case. Finally, this paper plugs this RL algorithm into the IL framework, which yields the ILARL algorithm. The authors prove that ILARL has better theoretical guarantees than previous algorithms regarding the number of expert trajectories and MDP trajectories."

However, such a regret decomposition has been presented in OAL. Furthermore, among the three types of errors, policy regret is the most difficult part to analyze. However, the analysis of the policy regret in Theorem 3 largely depends on existing techniques developed in OAL and [Sherman et al., 2023b].\n2. The empirical evaluation is limited.

The first two terms in the regret decomposition are for learning a policy which performs well on the estimate of the expert\u2019s occupancy measure on the feature space.\n\nAn empirical estimate controls the 3rd error term, the second regret term can be controlled by OGD or any other online learning algorithm, while the authors provide an improved analysis for the regret of the first term, which cannot easily be solved by a generic no-regret algorithm because of the unknown transition dynamics, which make it impossible to project onto the space of valid occupancy measures. The authors propose a no regret algorithm in two steps: Policy evaluation is done using a fresh batch of data collected on-policy to get an optimistic estimate of the Q function; policy updates are not done greedily, but are done using the average optimistic $Q$ value computed from a batch of episodes to carry out infrequent policy updates. The approach resembles an MWE update with a finite-buffer to eliminate old and inaccurate $Q$ estimates. In a sense, the approach is similar to variance reduction in stochastic optimization.\n\nThe novelty in the analysis in the paper is in showing an improved algorithm for linear MDPs with adversarial costs in the full information setting. The authors show a regret bound which scales as $\\tilde{O} (d^{3/4} H^{3/2} K^{3/4})$ which improves over the previous best result of $\\tilde{O} (d^{3/4} H^2 K^{3/4})$."

I am not reducing my score for the paper because of this point, but if the paper gets rejected, I encourage the author to run more comprehensive experiments. Typically on harder environments, it is quite difficult to achieve the expert's performance, but this is not the case in any of the experiments in the paper.\n\nThe results of Rajaraman et al (2021) in the offline setting do not require linear reward or a uniform occupancy measure.

In the online setting, the work Swamy et al (2022) provides a general analysis of the estimator used in Lemma 10 of the paper to go beyond the uniform feature measure assumption. While in general these two lines of work are not comparable, since the current paper assumes a model where the expert is arbitrary but the optimal policy falls in a linear class, as opposed to the linear expert setting (where the expert is a linear classifier), it would be interesting to see in a future work if there is a better connection between these settings.\n\nSwamy et al (2022): https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/2e809adc337594e0fee330a64acbb982-Paper-Conference.pdf\n\nMinor:\n1. \"Therefore, the policy suboptimality scale as $H^4 \\log |\\Pi| / \\epsilon^2$\".
