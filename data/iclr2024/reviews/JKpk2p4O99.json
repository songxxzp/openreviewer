                "value": "The majority of existing methods for generating Unlearnable Examples primarily focus on investigating the robustness against adversarial training, while overlooking the resilience to other attack strategies such as data augmentation and preprocessing. Previous research has found that images containing semantic information are robust against common attacks. In this paper, the authors propose a novel defense mechanism that is effective under various prevalent attack methods. The authors first generate multiple image samples corresponding to the number of categories using ControlNet, and then employ Image Hiding techniques to conceal the generated image samples within the dataset to be protected, utilizing Invertible Neural Networks (INN). This process disrupts the original semantic information of the images, thereby achieving the goal of protecting the data."

In summary, the ideas presented in this paper are intriguing, but the innovation is insufficient.\n- Previous research has shown that some Unlearnable Examples possess an inherent resistance to data augmentation, which contradicts the paper's claim that prior methods have overlooked these issues.\n- In the experimental settings of the paper, the perturbation for adversarial training is set to $8/255$, and the perturbation for protection noise also appears to be set to $8/255$ according to the experimental table. Under this setting, which is consistent with EntF, the paper's experiments lack a comparison with this method.\n- The paper doesn't explain why it's also effective under adversarial training.\n\nAlthough the introduction of Image hiding in the paper is interesting, the three important parts of the article are existing work and lack innovation. In addition, there is a lack of comparison of EntF methods, a lack of inquiry about defense against training, and a lack of inquiry about the effect of the generated hiding image on protection. All in all, at this point in time, I would recommend this paper as weak reject."

If some hackers know an image is protected in this way, they may find a countermeasure for the unlearnable examples based on the proposed hidden semantic generations.  \n\n3. A pre-trained ResNet-18 is used as the feature extractor, all text prompts are clustered using K-means with the semantic features from the CLIP model, and Stable Diffusion model and ControlNet to generate semantic images. It's hard to analyze the effectiveness of each component.  \n\n4. From the above, the connection between the hidden image and the unlearnable example is unclear. The hidden semantic image may not directly contribute to unlearnability.  \n\n5. The robustness and effectiveness may come from the pre-trained ResNet-18, CLIP, Stable Diffusion, or ControlNet. Therefore, the effectiveness and robustness may not come from the architecture and the idea; instead, these may only come from the extra information from the four pre-trained models.  \n\n6. Although an LFC (a pretrained ResNet18) is used to regularize intra-class variance, and the CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and ControlNet are used to maximize inter-class separation, the author should consider the alignment between these pretrained models.  \n\n7. Although Grad-CAM is used to visualize the attention of DNNs, the intra-class and inter-class relationship with the classification and semantic generation should be more fully exploited. Evaluating the inter-class and intra-class statistics directly could also substantiate the claims around controlled semantics, see questions."

Using clean images from different classes as hidden semantic images, or using random natural images as hidden semantic images, rather than generated ones. As you noted, this removes the control over the consistency of semantics within a class. The drop in unlearnability can show the importance of controlled generation. \n\n2. Removing the Latent Feature Concentration (LFC) module. This would demonstrate the impact of the proposed module in regularizing intra-class perturbations. \n\n3. Removing the CLIP-based clustering of text prompts. Using random prompts for generation removes controlled inter-class differences. \n\n4.
