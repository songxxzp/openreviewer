                "value": "This paper examines the impact of fine-tuning on downstream or primary tasks using pretrained models in terms of empirical and certified robustness. It identifies trends in the robustness of models fine-tuned in supervised or self-supervised pretraining settings compared to baseline models (initialized randomly) across various low and high-resolution image datasets. The findings suggest that, empirically, whether a pretrained model undergoes adversarial training or not doesn't significantly influence the robustness performance for the downstream task. Furthermore, they illustrate that the introduction of pretrain model to adversarial training of downstream tasks improves both standard and robust performances of the tasks. These insights indicate that for tasks with limited labeled data, there is no necessity for adversarial training during the pretraining phase of the model. Utilizing models trained either in supervised or unsupervised manners can yield comparable robustness performance."

However, the absence of comparative experimental results and analyses from this perspective, coupled with a lack of information on baseline training, pretraining, and fine-tuning, makes it challenging to anticipate the outcomes. Given that the studies cited by the authors conducted such analyses, it seems imperative to perform analogous investigations for each downstream task.\n- Beyond presenting results from transfer learning using standard and adversarial pretrained models, the paper does not seem to offer additional contributions. The experiments related to certified robustness in transfer learning don't offer much beyond simple application, making it hard to view them as significant contributions. Furthermore, it's reasonably intuitive that empirical robustness would display trends similar to those observed.\n- For the authors to claim they \"proposed\" transfer learning, they should have either introduced a distinct robust transfer learning methodology and validated its superiority against prior methods, or at the very least, presented a \"bag of tricks\" that analyzes optimal hyperparameter settings for robust transfer learning."

However, for a precise comparison, it seems necessary to display results comparing methodologies that adapt to an adversarial setting in Tables 2 and 3. Furthermore, Table 4 should provide a side-by-side comparison of results from both supervised and self-supervised methods.\n- Are there experimental results addressing the efficiency aspect mentioned under weaknesses?"

This paper makes a claim that contradicts previous research (Hendrycks et al., 2019), which argues the necessity of robust pre-training for a substantial improvement in empirical adversarial robustness, but it does not provide sufficient analysis to support it. Considering the results in Table 2, when observing the results for Rand Init. on CIFAR-10, the gap between SA and RA is only 4.5% points. This suggests that the adversarial budget used in the experiments might be too small to highlight the difference between adversarial training and standard training.\n3. The claim in Section 4.1 that the improved RA is due to improved SA is difficult to accept. When comparing the results of Sup. Pre-Training and Self-Sup. Pre-Training for Food, CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, SUN397, DTD, and Pets in Table 2, it can be seen that despite SA being lower, RA is higher."
