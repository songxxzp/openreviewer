                "value": "This paper addresses the problem of generate a diverse range of high-quality outputs by using AI feedbacks, instead of traditional Quality-Diversity (QD) search algorithms. The authors propose a Quality-Diversity through AI feedback (QDAF) where an evolutionary algorithm applies LMs to both generate variation and evaluate the quality and diversity of candidate text. Experiments show that produced outputs have a reasonable agreement between AI and human evaluation.\n\nThe proposed approach QDAIF builds upon MAP-Elites [Mouret and Clune, 2015], which follows those steps: randomly select a solution, mutate it, evaluate the new solution in terms of quality and diversity. Finally, if the new solution is better, all previous cells are replaced. The improvement of QDAIF is significant and leverage the characteristics of LLMs. Instead of using a uniformly-separated grid, the authors split the grid by density. This makes a lot of sense because we output distributions generated by LLMs are skewed. The initialization and mutation are based on few-shot prompting. Finally, the quality and diversity evaluation is done via prompting the LLMs and observing whether the answer is \"yes\" or \"no\" and their log-probabilities.\nOverall, the method is a composition of simply ideas that make it easy to follow.\n\nThe experiments consists of creative text generation in the domains of opinions and stories. The domain in the former is about eating plant-based diets, and for the latter a short story containing a spy and a politician. Diversity is based on the sentiment towards a topic in case o opinions and genre and ending for the stories. The authors evaluate using QD score [Pugh et al. 2016] and human evaluation. In terms of baseline, they seem to be simple variations of the framework. It would be needed to have baselines cited in prior work. The results are significantly better for QDAIF, but it is unclear whether this is due because the baselines are bad or whether the model is really better. I appreciate the other experiments that the authors have conducted on scaling up the models and trying other mutation methods.\n\nOverall, the paper is well structured and written. The idea is simple but sounds effective. My only concern is the lack of more sophisticated baselines. I would ask the authors to evaluate their proposed approach on another task, such as control text generation (e.g., writing about specific topics and using a classifier to assess the topic being discussed)"
