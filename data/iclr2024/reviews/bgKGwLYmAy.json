                "value": "This paper analyzes the factors influencing the performance of graph learning models. The authors proposes a model named DGTAT, which is based on MPNN and a sampling strategy. The proposed method decouples local and global interactions, separates learnable positional, attribute, and structural encodings, and computes triple attention. This design allows DGTAT to capture long-range dependencies akin to Transformers while preserving the inductive bias of the graph topology."

It is unclear to see from the results that the proposed techniques in this paper works.\n\n2. There is no experimental result showing that how the proposed components in this paper performs. It is necessary to do ablation study to see how the performance changes with/without a particular module.\n\n3. The presentation of this paper could be improved. The authors introduces a lot of notations, and sometimes it is hard to find the actual meaning of a particular notation. Figure 1 and figure 2 is also confusing and hard to understand."

There are only vague claims on page 14 stating that \"compared to the GT with SE/PE, through the decoupling of PE, SE and AE, DGTAT can distinguish some graphs with more sensitive position, structure, and attribute information that coupled PS/SE cannot learn\" (this is an assumption, not an explanation/analysis).
