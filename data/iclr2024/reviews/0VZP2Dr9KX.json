                "value": "The major concern that prevents me from giving a straight recommendation for acceptance is that the evaluation is based on the GCG attack proposed (Zou et al., 2023), which is a universal attack that learns to append the same adversarial suffix to every prompt for jailbreak attempts. However, from the computer vision domain, it is also known that universal attacks are easier to detect/defense than individually optimized adversarial examples (Finding a universal adversarial perturbation is mathematically more difficult than finding a specific adversarial perturbation for one image). Therefore, the conclusion made by this paper may be different if one considers the GCG attack on every prompt separately, instead of learning to do a universal attack. \n\nHere are my suggestions:\n1. I hope the authors can come up with new experiments that evaluate individual GCG attacks, and check if the conclusion holds or not. If also seems to me that the attacker may break the perplexity detection in the adaptive attack setting if the goal is to find a low-perplexity adversarial suffix for only one prompt, instead of many prompts simultaneously.\n2. On adaptive attack against paraphrasing, can the authors check if appending the same adversarial suffix to the paraphrased prompt can regain the attack effectiveness or not?\n3. On Sec. 4.3 - I hesitate to agree the studied method is \"robust optimization\". While it is true that the terminology of adversarial training (via augmenting with some (non-optimized) adversarial examples in the training loss) is consistent with what is proposed by Goodfellow et al. in 2013/2014, the evaluated scheme is different from the more popular minimax-based adversarial training method proposed by Madry et al., following the practice of robust optimization. It also seems that the studied method only augments with the human-crafted adversarial prompts to fine-tune an LLM, instead of iteratively generating new adversarial prompts during training. Therefore, I suggest removing the use of \"robust optimization\" in that paragraph, and making the message clear that this observation does not imply the result of minimax-based adversarial training method (which is unclear what is the best way to define and execute, as the authors pointed out). Otherwise, this section may give the incorrect message that \"robust optimization\" does not give strong robustness of LLMs against jailbreak attacks.\n4. [Minor] There are some recent papers (after the ICLR submission deadline) that propose improved (automated) jailbreak prompt generations with high influence to bypass perplexity-based detections, so perplexity-based detections may not be as strong as the paper claimed (aka the defense can be already broken). However, I understand those results are concurrent to this study, and I won't take this point into my final rating."

                "value": "I find the motivation, ideas, and conclusions derived in this paper to be problematic for many reasons. I will also provide individual issues for each of the defenses studied, below.\n\n- (Overview) **Lack of Proper Motivation and Significance**: The paper raises many questions (such as in the abstract: *\"What threat models are practically useful in this domain?\"* and *\"How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain?\"*) but fails to provide concrete answers for these to the reader. The paper ends on more unanswered questions (Section 5.1). This is due to a lack of proper motivation: the paper from the start is set up to only study the proposed baseline defenses which are either incompletely or trivially designed (I will discuss this later). Although the authors attempt to draw general conclusions, since there is only one attack proposed by Zou et al [1] for LLMs, the results cannot be interpreted generally (I discuss this next). Finally, the evaluation setups are inconsistent and keep varying between experiments, and smaller LLMs are mostly considered (discussed below). In sum, the paper feels incomplete and in my opinion does not provide substantial evidence for the initial claims made by the authors which is why I am leaning towards rejection.\n\n- **Single-Attack Study Cannot Generalize**: The paper draws many *general* conclusions from the derived results, such as indicating the strengths or weaknesses of a particular baseline defense (e.g. end of Section 4.1: *\"However, perplexity filtering is potentially valuable in a system where high perplexity prompts are not discarded, but rather treated with other defenses, or as part of a larger moderation campaign to identify malicious users\"*). However, this is an untenable claim, as all the baseline defense experiments are conducted on a single optimization attack proposed by Zou et al [1] and we do not know the space of adversarial LLM samples that exist to a clear extent. Clearly, the scope of the work is fairly limited given this fact. Owing to these reasons, the paper seems incomplete and almost *too early* as there should be more attacks proposed first by the community to derive a general trend for baseline defenses. As an analogue, Carlini et al's [2] seminal paper on guidelines for defenses in deep neural networks was written after a number of attacks had been proposed.\n\n- **Inconsistent Experimental Setups**: The paper has multiple experiments, but all of these are conducted on a different set of LLMs. For Section 4.1 the authors use Falcon-7B, Vicuna-7B, Guanaco-7B, ChatGLM-6B, and MPT-7B. For experiments in Section 4.2, Alpaca-7B is also introduced; why wasn't this used in 4.1 experiments? For Section 4.3 Llama1-7B and Alpaca are considered, and the other models are dropped. This inconsistency in experimental setup and evaluation is a major issue and hinders readers from getting a clear picture of the results. This issue also extends to other evaluation aspect of the work, such as in Section 4.1, nowhere do the authors mention what the actual value of the threshold $T$ for the perplexity filter is for most of the experiments. They just mention that it is the upper bound of perplexity on the AdvBench dataset which makes it hard to contextualize other results with respect to those of Figure 2 (when the threshold is varied).\n\n- **Evaluation Only on Weaker Models**: Even though the original attack approach of Zou et al [1] was evaluated on multiple black-box LLMs such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, PaLM-2, and GPT-4, the authors never consider these powerful models in experiments. In fact, most of the experiments are only localized to smaller LLMs roughly around the 7B parameter size. If the issue is API or black-box access, in my view, the defense approaches can still be applied as a preprocessing step. Even then, as Llama-2-13B and Llama-2-70B models are available open-source, this issue can actually be bypassed. A lack of evaluation on powerful and more relevant models is also a major drawback of the work.\n\n- **Issues with Each Defense Baseline**:\n    - **Perplexity Filter**: Regarding the perplexity filter, the description by the authors of its efficacy (last paragraph Section 4.1: *\"the defense succeeds..\"* and others) is in contrast with the results obtained. As Figure 1 shows, the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is greater than 50% for the Guanaco and Falcon LLMs even as $\\alpha_{ppl}$ is increased. Also, ChatGLM and MPT LLMs are the only ones for which ASR tends to 0, but their performance initially is close to 0 to begin with. More importantly, even after the filter, if 20% of the prompts bypass the windowed perplexity filter, why can the attacker not just reproduce prompts similar to these (e.g. via paraphrasing) and attack the LLM with a large volume of such prompts? It also excessively targets benign prompts and I am not convinced that there is a good approach for choosing the threshold $T$. Due to these reasons, I believe this baseline is too trivial and does not convery any useful information about efficacy and complexity of optimizer attacks for LLMs.\n\n    - **Paraphrasing Prompts**: The issue with this defense is that if the defender can utilize a more powerful LLM for paraphrasing (such as GPT-3.5-Turbo as the authors have done), why can they not directly use that model for their LLM related tasks? It would make more sense to directly use ChatGPT instead of filtering responses using ChatGPT and then using Vicuna. What would be interesting and more viable, would be to use a more traditional paraphrasing approach for the adversarial prompt and then assessing whether ASR can be lowered. In its current form, the defense does not seem tenable as a baseline.\n\n\n    - **Attempting Adversarial Training**: The approach employed by the authors in Section 4.3 is an approximate attempt at adversarial training. It is evident why it doesn't work well, as the inner adversarial optimization step can only use human generated adversarial prompts instead of optimizer generated ones, due to computational issues. In this manner, this approach is incomplete and already unsatisfactory as a baseline. In my opinion, it cannot even constitute a negative result because the approach is not sufficiently close to true adversarial training. This also relates to my earlier point on the work being *premature*. In this case, it would actually be beneficial to improve the optimization approach used for attack samples to enable adversarial training of LLMs. \n\n\n\n___\n___\n___\nReferences:\n1.
