Regarding optical flow, I wonder if there is more clarification on why optical flow is not a good choice for pre-training? Is it because the prediction is more inaccurate / harder? Furthermore, how about optical flow as a downstreaming task? Does depth pre-training still help? \n\n3. In Figure 2, I wonder why Depth-rand is on par with ImageNet pre-trained for ResNet-18, but the observation is very different for ResNet-50. I wonder if the authors have any thoughts on this?\n\n4. Suppose more images are available, would the pre-training in depth still be beneficial? For example, in Figure 3, what if there are hundreds of images, maybe using the full training set? Similarly, for segmentation, how much gain could the model obtain if there are more images? Is it also the case that only 16 images are used for fine-tuning for the results obtained?\n\n5. It would be helpful to clarify the experiment settings in Table 1 at the beginning of the experiment section. I wonder if the authors may further clarify the difference between  \u2018Depth-Rand\u2019 and \u2018Depth\u2019?\n\n6.

Which backbone models are used for these experiments (ResNet18 or ResNet50)? \n    - Similar questions for Section 4.3 for the NYU-V2 dataset.\n    - Table 3 (COCO), I assume it reports the results over the testing set of KITTI (rather than COCO)? Also, which dataset do authors use for monocular depth pre-training (KITTI or COCO)?  Did all methods (Depth, MAE, DINO, MOCO v2) use the same pre-training data? Which backbone models are used for these experiments (ResNet18 or ResNet50)? These serve as important references for evaluation and reproduction, which are not clearly specified in this paper.\n 2. Where is Table 4.1 (Page 6)?\n 3. Potential unfairness in comparison. \n    - In Table 2, \"Depth\" used KITTI as pre-training set while testing on the same dataset. This comparison to the baseline (ImageNet pre-training) is unfair. This is because the training distribution is much closer to the testing distribution for \"Depth\". In contrast, ImageNet is characterized as object-centric and thus has a pretty large domain gap to KITTI collected by autonomous cars. What about performance comparison on COCO between ImageNet pre-train and Depth pre-train?\n    - In Table 3, the \"Supervised Segmentation\" performance should be results that trained on KITTI instead of MS-COCO if the authors used KITTI as pre-training and testing data. \n 4. Lack of analysis on representation transferability. For example, how is the performance of Depth Pre-train over other segmentation datasets such as COCO and ADE20K? How about transferring to object detection? Transferability is one of the major functions of pre-training. The authors should present relevant experimental results.\n 5. Despite the authors proving the effectiveness of pre-training with depth estimation, it still requires significant RGB-D data which cannot be collected online for large-scale pre-training data. Compared to self-supervised studies, e.g. MoCo-variants and MAE, this method has limited application scope."
