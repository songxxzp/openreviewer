I applaud the authors for a clear, technically sound presentation of a clever idea that evidently (as shown by the experimental evaluation) leads to improvements in classification accuracy for classifiers that are trained through active learning. While the related work part is a bit short, it covers relevant concepts and previous work in the field. The technical approach is nice: combining crowdsourcing with active learning, thereby taking into account that crowd annotators are not necessarily experts and then turning this around by assigning assumed confidence values to individual annotators through the majority voting on multiply labels samples and looking at consistency amongst individual annotators and their performance (with regard to the majority votes) is clever. Combining this with the budget constraint that is often used in active learning scenarios evidently leads to an effective active learning scheme. The experimental evaluation is solid. The authors did a good job in experimenting over a range of datasets (even though some more details on these should have been given, e.g., in an appendix, to make the paper more comprehensive). As usual in the field, alas, no statistical significance analysis has been performed \u2014 yet the numerical gains are large enough such that this reviewer (who has experience with those datasets) believes that the gains actually are significant (see weaknesses and questions). The presentation of the approach is solid and the paper is easy to follow."

ICLR is, as per its own definition, a venue that focuses on representation learning / deep learning. This paper is essentially a core machine learning paper, yet it does not actually cover representation learning nor deep learning. As such, I see this paper in its current form slightly out of scope for ICLR. The second concern (impact) comes from the fact that active learning has been around for quite a while (even including the crowd sourcing component as identified by the authors), and the field is somewhat saturated. The presented approach is clever and effective for a range of standard classification tasks but I wonder whether this would actually be of substantial enough interest for the ICLR audience. If the authors would link their work closer to recent applications / problems in the deep learning / representation learning field it probably would gain more attention / impact."

Detailed traits of each dataset should be exhibited. The number of annotators is too small.

The experiment part lacks an explanation for the specific values of these hyper-parameters. Due to the core component being the annotator model, a well-work $ f_{\\theta} $ is really important to the proposed method.

How to guarantee that the annotator model works well? If the training data is unbalanced or responses from annotators have great bias, the annotator model will fail.

The efficacy of the sample selection strategy would be more convincingly demonstrated if the same level of accuracy could be achieved with fewer queries.\n\nQ2: In the method proposed by the article, a weighted majority scheme is employed to compute the confidence among different annotators.
