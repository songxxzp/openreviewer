This method uses a Transformer encoder to capture the environment dynamic via predicting the per time-step states and the trajectory return. A separate policy module is learned with imagined returns from the Transformer world model to maximize the expected return. Thus, compared with model-free counterpart methods, this method is more data-efficient. During policy optimization, the gradient is allowed to back-propagate through the world model. A moving average of policy weights is maintained throughout training to stabilize the policy learning process, and the updated policy weight is also forced to keep close to the moving average (Trust Region Constraints, TRC). Ablation study necessitates the importance of TRC and stochastic back-propagation. However, predicting state per time-step seems not crucial. Experiments showed improved data efficiency compared with several baseline methods on the OpenAI gym tasks."

This is known as the problem of compounding error.\n\t- I also doubt the argument behind TRC since the policy is trained with on-policy data during imagination, the learning policy is always in the \"trust region\". Moreover, equation 6 optimizes the expected return with respect to $\\tilde{\\pi}(w | c, \\theta)$ instead of the learning policy. The policy is learned indirectly via the KL regularizer. I wonder if the learning is effective in this way.\n\t- The moving average of policy weights here reminds me of other actor-critic methods, so I'm curious about that, instead of using the TRC, maintaining a moving average of $R_\\phi(c, w)$, directly optimizing the learning policy via $E_\\pi(w | c)[- \\tilde{R}_\\phi(c, w)]$ might also help.\n- Could the authors prove the necessity of using a Transformer by comparing the proposed method with an RNN-based world model?

Specifically, the 5D reacher task seems quite simple (given that it is still a planar reaching problem) and I would expect most current RL methods to solve it to a similar level of performance under reasonable hyperparameter settings. The authors should add at least one \"standard\" environment to ensure fair comparison. It would be also good to compare against a modern sample-efficient RL method (e.g. REDQ, Dreamer, etc.) to validate the sample efficiency claims.\n\nFor the maximum jump height task, it may be helpful to include a baseline that keeps \"max height achieved so far\" as an additional state variable and applies SAC/PPO with the correct task reward (i.e. reward equal to $\\max(0, h_t-\\max_{1\\le t \\le t-1}h_t)$).\n\nThe ablations claim that ET works better with the stochastic backpropagation scheme than with REINFORCE, but the experiments don't seem to lend strong support for this and there seems to be quite a bit of overlap between the reported confidence intervals for the two. The authors should remove these claims or run a new experiment to tighten the confidence intervals and confirm whether there is some significant effect.\n\nGiven the ablations, it's not clear why it's necessary to predict true environment states in the first place. It seems that it would simplify the presentation of the method with no drawbacks if the state-prediction heads were removed. Additionally, as far as I can tell no ablation compares ET against a simpler model. This would be helpful to justify the Transformer model (e.g. can the same thing be accomplished with a smaller reward model?)\n\nThe introduction and related work should be reworked. Particularly, the explanation of Markovian rewards contains several questionable statements; e.g. the task of \"throwing objects into bins\" could absolutely be expressed with a Markovian reward - the problem in that case is with long-term credit assignment, in which case episodic RL could certainly perform better."
