What are the specific design choices in the denoising diffusion architecture, or the training loss functions and hyperparameters, or some other aspects, that are necessary for the successful learning of facial motions from speech? In other words, why would an existing diffusion architecture for body motion generation (such as [A] or [B], albeit with different training features) not work for this problem?\n\n[A] Ao, Tenglong, Zeyi Zhang, and Libin Liu. \"GestureDiffuCLIP: Gesture diffusion model with CLIP latents.\" ACM Transactions on Graphics, August 2023.\n[B] Dabral, Rishabh, Muhammad Hamza Mughal, Vladislav Golyanik, and Christian Theobalt. \"Mofusion: A framework for denoising-diffusion-based motion synthesis.\" In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 9760-9770. 2023.\n\n2.

This reconstruction than learning of a set of 3DMM parameters with related lips movements based on these 2D datasets. However, this is not much convincing to me. Lips movements associated to speech are quite subtle and with specificity from each individual. Reconstructing such subtle movements with a 3DMM from a 2D video sequence seems not capable of capturing the reality of movement. In my opinion, authors should convince the readers more about this point which is also fundamental for the proposed approach. \n- Table 1 is not fully convincing because the other compared methods were developed for working with different data and so the proposed evaluation could be somewhat biased. \n- The supplemental video material is not fully convincing. For some speech the lips movement and the audio track are not well synchronized. The lips movement is also quite synthetic with the lips that are not able to close. The movement is also on the lips only without facial expression shown during face lips animation.\n- There is not much discussion on the proposed method.
