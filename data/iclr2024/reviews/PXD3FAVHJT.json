First of all, the generalization capabilities offered by RLHF has been widely observed in state-of-the-art models, with clear comparisons and case studies of output from pretrained, instruction fine-tuned, and RLHF fine-tuned models (see, for example, the Llama-2 paper). The mode collapse phenomenon from RLHF has also been widely observed and measured. Maybe the only novelty this paper offers is evaluation on an array of sentence-level diversity metrics. Furthermore, the claims made in the paper are not very well-justified by experiment results, and some experiment details are lacking. Only two sets of experiments, namely summarization and instruction following, are conducted on one single model (Llama-7B), yet the paper makes a general claim about the effects of RLHF. More experiments on different models at potentially different scales could be helpful, but still, the contribution seems to be incremental. \n\nMy main concern is the contribution. Some additional questions are listed below for clarification, but unless the authors could justify their contribution through substantial experiments (on different models at different scales) and more in-depth analysis, I still lean towards rejection."

How does one arrive at the \"style\" conclusion?\n\nWhy is there no error bars in Figure 5? Could you plot error bars over different choices of outputs from among the set of outputs to the same input?\n\nAre the OOD datasets considered OOD for fine-tuning, or both fine-tuning and pretraining? The CNN/DailyMail dataset is most probably included in the pretraining dataset of Llama-7B."

Indeed, LLMs are imitating human speech. In that framework, RLHF corresponds to adversarial imitation learning (AIL) methods, and SFT corresponds to behavioral cloning (BC). To the best knowledge of the reviewer, that theoretical study reveals that AIL (RLHF) methods can have better out-of-distribution generalization performance than BC (SFT) because AIL methods optimize their policy on out-of-distribution states (prompts) and rigorously prove this phenomenon. I believe this related work is insightful for studying the advantages of RLHF over SFT, and this paper should be mentioned in the related work.\n\n[1] Xu, Tian, et al. \"On the generalization of adversarial imitation learning and beyond.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.10424* (2021).\n\n\n- Typos and Writing Suggestions\n\n1.

                "value": "The major concerns stem from the fact that the empirical evaluation heavily relies on the training quality of each algorithm, and the reviewer is uncertain about whether RLHF is trained to a high standard.\n\n**Question 1**: Do empirical conclusions heavily depend on the training status of the reward model and PPO? The reviewer observed that this paper freezes some layers of LLMs when using RLHF, which may limit the representation capacity. Thus, the reviewer questions whether the training of RLHF is of good quality. Could this paper provide the evaluation accuracy of the reward model and training curves of PPO?\n\n**Question 2**: Why not use entropy as a metric of diversity (although existing evaluation methods are acceptable)?\n\n**Discussion**: This paper mentions that \"Future work should investigate why RLHF reduces the output diversity so much,\" and the reviewer would like to point out some observations: the optimal policy by RL algorithms is deterministic (i.e., less diversity), if there is no tie in the reward value, there is no KL penalty, and the optimization is done perfectly. When there is a KL penalty, a recent paper shows that this corresponds to \"soft Q-learning\" [2]. In that case, the reward model is optimized perfectly. Although the algorithm in [2] is not applicable to the true RLHF setting where we only have out-of-distribution prompts and no preference labels, the viewpoint in [2] is insightful for in-distribution training.\n\n[2] Rafailov, Rafael, et al. \"Direct preference optimization: Your language model is secretly a reward model.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.18290* (2023)."
