                "value": "1. I consider Equation 5 is the distance calculation formula that the author has redefined between villages. I would like the author to clarify whether this calculation method satisfies the conditions for distance definition.\n2. The experimental section lacks an analysis of the hyperparameter \"r\".\n3. WLCF is one of the crucial steps in the algorithm. However, the author's description of WLCF is not sufficiently clear. Additionally, during the experimental process, I would like to see some ablation experiments to verify the impact of each step in the algorithm on the final clustering results.\n4. I suggest that the author perform visual analysis on some artificial non- convex datasets (such as Two Moon, Flower, etc.) and visualize each step of the algorithm to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
