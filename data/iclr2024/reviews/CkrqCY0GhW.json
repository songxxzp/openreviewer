This is especially true because \"compositionality\" is inherently somewhat arbitrary: the tasks in MiniWoB are arguably already compositional since they require a series of steps performed in the right order. By the same reasoning, arguably, all language model hierarchical/long-range planning papers, not to mention several multimodal language model approaches designed to reason over images, are performing compositional tasks. I'd also point out that there are specific strategies that have been proposed specifically for compositional action (e.g., Parsel from Zelikman et al. 2022, which uses LMs to propose a high-level plan in language and implements each subpart independently).\n\nSome nitpicks: The title makes it sound like the model itself is harmed, but that doesn't really make sense. And, in conjunction with the earlier point about MiniWoB also being somewhat compositional, the title isn't necessarily backed up by the experiments. I think this could be easily partially fixed by simply adding \"for web automation\" to the title after LMA, and web automation is probably relevant enough that with this narrower scope, it's still fine. I expect I would lower my score if the authors don't commit to making this or some other disambiguating change."
