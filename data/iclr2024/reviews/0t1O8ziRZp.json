They proposed three methods, one based on MCTS and a trained policy on training netlist (MCTS+L) and the other, and more superior, is using MCTS and a trained policy with a variable to control the reliance on the trained policy or the online MCTS search (ABC-RL). The variable \\alpha is determined based on a nearest neighbor search to determine if the netlist is close to the training netlists or not. The authors split the dataset of netlists into train, validation, and test sets and used the train to train the policy and used the validation set to set the hyperparameter that controls \\alpha. The experimental results show that the ABC-RL can outperform the other methods and SOTA in most of the test netlists and can achieve the best goe-mean performance."

The circuit similarity is a performance proxy for pretrained agent and MCTS method, and use that proxy to predict the weights to ensemble two models. The novelty, in this sense, is limited. Is it possible to combine more synthesis strategies based on a more general performance predictor at test time?\n\n2.\tThe usage of BERT is not well justified. There are other simpler methods to encode variable-length sequences, e.g., RNN. The attention model is also data-hungry during training. Why BERT is the most suitable encoder?\n\n3.\tThe assumption that learned policy cannot generalize to diverse benchmarks is not well supported. If there is generalizable knowledge in circuit representation and synthesis strategies, it should try to improve the generalization of the learned policy by using more data/better algorithms. If this problem in nature is not generalizable or learnable, then it is not necessary to use an RL agent to learn the synthesis strategy at the beginning. The proposed method does not fundamentally explain or solve the learnability of circuit synthesis problems, but rather uses two model ensembles to just cover some in-distribution data with learned model and out-of-distribution examples by search."

One concern with this approach is whether GCN-based AIG embeddings can effectively scale to real-world circuit designs.\n2. With the integration of GNN + transformer features.
