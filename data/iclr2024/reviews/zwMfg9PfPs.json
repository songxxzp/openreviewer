It may be helpful to clarify.\n\nSection 3:\nAs I am trying to get a sense of the restriction and applicability of the approach, I was wondering the following questions:\u00a0\n- How does the method fair with the oracle as the magnitude of the noise increases?\u00a0\n- What if the noise is not gaussian but more heavy tailed?\u00a0\n- Does the performance degrade or improve with increasing number of variables?\u00a0\n- I assume Theorem 3 does not apply to discrete variables because of the violation of differentiability; is that right?\n\nSection 4:\n- Can include missing-not-at-random imputation and covariate-missing imputation as two more baseline models (a search in Google scholar using the two key phrases yields some methods).\n- It would be really interesting if the authors could find some real-world datasets, create source and target environments by sub-setting the columns, and see how the method performs.\n- Figure 3: I don\u2019t quite understand the figure. It would be helpful to define OOV loss, be explicit about the number of samples on the y-axis being (x2,x3,y) or (x1,x2,y) or something else. I also don\u2019t understand why relative loss is zero means the method is on par with the oracle predictor. Why not just show how the fine-tuning error compares with oracle training, which seems easier to interpret? Anyway, I am overall a bit confused about the figure, so my questions may not make sense."

It addresses a high-value problem in a principled fashion, shows how certain assumptions help obtain certain results and how and in which cases these assumptions can be bypasses while maintain approximately accurate results, and evaluates these cases in terms of loss accuracy as well as sample complexity of its approach versus baseline approaches.\n- The paper openly highlights limitations in its work, such as assumptions made for theorems to hold, and proposes prospective future work in multiple avenues.

The approach is promising and can be applied in many real-world settings through Monte-Carlo sampling or similar methods.
