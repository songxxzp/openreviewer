They show that their method achieves better perplexity on accuracies on WikiText2 and GLUE tasks respectively.\n\nThe authors also contribute a new Triton kernel for performing efficient sparse attention."

However, the authors in the paper still need to train their Performer and Decoder from scratch. I haven't seen any discussion about the inherent cost of doing that. Intuitively, it should be cheaper than training from scratch, but can you point me to the text (or elaborate in a new discussion) about how expensive it is to do this training?\n\nW2. This is my subjective view, but the paper is extremely dense and hard to follow. I'd recommend reducing the notation significantly and moving most of the details to the appendix. I appreciate the figures, but overwhelming them with notation does aid my understanding of your method in the current version of the paper.\n\nI recommend: 1) simpler figures with less notation that can clearly explain your method conceptually; 2) moving a lot of the notation in the text for the appendix.\n\nW3. It seems to me that some of the results are a bit underwhelming. For example, in Figure 4, panel (a), right figure, what is the motivation to use your method, since I could use a Vanilla transformer and achieve an on-par accuracy with much less latency?"

They show their method outperforms other linear and sparse attention methods in language modeling tasks, specifically on GLUE and Wikitext2, while being competitive in terms of memory usage and latency. SEA introduces additional model parameters which are trained on top of a pretrained model using knowledge distillation. Unlike some of its competitors, the method remains interpretable."

Moreover, unlike other approaches, SEA can successfully approximate the full-attention of pretrained OPT models."
