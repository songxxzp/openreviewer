Now there are fundamental advancement in terms of embedding based KNN acceleration, and this paper's topic becomes very important. Given we need to do a sophisticated reranking, is it possible to use embedding to approximate. This will largely help with the performance of the recommendation or information retrieval task. In addition to that, the theory is sound in the paper. One extension could be about the estimation of the dimension needed for a tolerance \\epsilon, but that will bring in a lot of difficulties. The writing before section 4 is also informative and clear. Overall I believe it's a good paper."

Though it's proved that such decomposition exists, finding those embedding mapping for Q and I can be very difficult. I'm looking for a more rigorous way to do that. For example, how to set the right dimension and have the confidence that the dimension is good enough the meet the approximation error \\epsilon. How to set the right \\epsilon and knowing it's small enough to ensure the retrieval quality is better than existing method e.g. from a set of embedding learned just for the retrieval stage. \n\nIn addition, I don't think \"relevance\" matters much in the context of the paper. Rewriting the paper into the standard retrieve-and-rank language would help. The problem is essentially how to improve the coarse retrieve stage by leveraging the rank stage model. The latter doesn't have to be a relevance model, but rather any fine-grained reranking model. The paper mentioned some examples like QA, which also doesn't fall into the relevance setting. One of the most popular use cases is to concatenate Q and I for transformer-based model to handle, and it's also not necessarily a relevance model.\n\nIn the experiment part, the latency or other system related metrics should be reported as well. The number of items retrieved could be tuned based on the retrieval stage quality as well as the system constraint. Directly comparing the proposed embedding with other baselines may not be helpful. They can easily be used to retrieve different number of items before reranking. Given the two-stage setting is mainly for computational cost concern (otherwise one can just use the reranking model for all Q-I pairs), the computation/system metrics are worth checking and reporting.\n\nThe writing in section 4 seems much worse compared to the previous sections. There are details or intuitions lacking (potentially due to page limit). Also adding multi-modal datasets e.g. video-language retrieval could help strengthen the paper."
