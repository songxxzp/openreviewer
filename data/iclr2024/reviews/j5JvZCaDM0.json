Unlike most of the existing studies that deals with expected form of safety constraints, this paper deals with hard safety constraint (i.e., probability-1 constraints). The authors discover that the hard safety constraint can be equivalently translated to identifying the largest feasible region given the offline dataset, which leads to a feasibility-dependent objective which can be further solved using three simple decoupled learning objectives. The authors compare their proposed algorithm called FISOR against baselines on DSRL benchmark for safe offline RL."

                "value": "### Related Work\n\nHard constraints in safe RL have been studied in online RL settings. There are several important missing references as being represented by:\n\n- Sootla, Aivar, et al. \"Saut\u00e9 rl: Almost surely safe reinforcement learning using state augmentation.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2022.\n- Wang, Yixuan, et al. \"Enforcing hard constraints with soft barriers: Safe reinforcement learning in unknown stochastic environments.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2023.\n- Wachi, Akifumi, and Yanan Sui. \"Safe reinforcement learning in constrained Markov decision processes.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2020.\n\nI agree with the authors that there is litte literature on safe **offline** RL and know that there is Table 4 in the Appendix. However, there are existing studies that are directly related to this paper. For example, Sootla et al. (2022) can be easily extended to the offline RL settings since all we have to do is to augment the state and provide a large penalty for violating the hard safety constraint.\n\n### Experiments\nWhile I would like to thank the authors for conducing good experiments, I am not fully convinced by the experimental results. First, all the baselines are based on the soft safety constraint and it seems unfair to simply compare their safety performances (Note that I do not say that such baseline methods should not be compared given there is few exising paper with the same problem settings). I personally consider that, if safe online RL algorithm can be extended to offline settings, such algorithms should be additionally included as a baseline. Second, I want the authors to discuss the experimental results on the reward performance. I understand sinec FISOR is enforced a hard constraint, it is natural that reward performance is deteriorated. However, under the condition that most of the baseline methods do not satisfy the safety constraint (because safety requirements are different by nature), I feel that it is rather arbitrary to compare the reward peformance **within** safe agents. Though the authors say that \" FISOR is the only method that can\nguarantee safety satisfaction in all tasks, while achieving top returns in most tasks\", I personally feel that this claim is overstated. I think the experimental results are interesting; hence, I would like the authors to discuss more on the **Main Results** paragraph for future readers (e.g., why CPQ satisfy the safety constraints, why FISOR does not perform well in Safety Gym tasks, etc.)"
