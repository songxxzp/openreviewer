                "value": "Major:\n- The model fusion strategy labeled as FENS is a specific case of what we call \"late fusion\" in the multimodal ML literature (see i.e. the references 39 and 40 in [1]), which has been already explored in depth (see all the rich literature on various fusion modules Multimodal Low-rank Bilinear pooling (MLB) / Multimodal Compact Bilinear (MCB), Multimodal Tucker Fusion, Attention, etc.). \nThe authors should orient the paper more towards examining late fusion schemes vs FL instead of proposing a new method because the method is far from new. In this respect the title of the article is fine: the focus should be on comparing ensembles to (iterative) FL.\nThe reviewer encourages the authors to drop the term FENS and to either remove or considerably shorten the corresponding sections 3.2 and 3.3.\n- It is very mysterious for the reviewer the impact of having access to Dproxy in the server. The reviewer questions even adding Dproxy in the first place as the question tackled by the paper should be whether ensembling methods can match FL and with the current framing it becomes: \"what is the effect of post-training on another dataset ?\".  If the authors want to use this Dproxy anyway they should add a comparison with an (iteratively)-FL trained model fine-tuned on Dproxy. Note that some concerns are also linked to the two first questions of the reviewer. Authors should change Figure 2b) to compare the best FL method (aka FedAdam) vs the best trained and the best untrained ensembling methods vs the best FL method fine-tuned on Dproxy.\n- Experiments on FLamby are inconclusive at best FENS does seem to outperform FL methods on Camelyon16 for Fed-Heart Disease and Fed-ISIC it is not the case so that goes a bit in the opposite direction that the paper argues. Note that Fed-IXI and Fed-TCGA-BRCA are also part of FLamby and relatively small the reviewer would like experiments on such datasets in order to form a more complete picture. Figure 4 would also benefit from including non-trained aggregation methods.\n- All the discussion on communication efficience Table 1 and 2 is wasteful. By design, ensembles will require order of magnitudes less communications no need to hammer the point with two tables at least they should go in the supplementary. If the authors want to keep it at least they should compare to efficient (sparse and quantified) iterative FL approach but the reviewer thinks this is not a very interesting thing to add to the paper.\n- So many more experiments would be needed to make this paper into a great paper. The reviewer already mentioned other FLamby datasets but also different experiments varying the heterogeneity source between centers by introducing artificial spurious correlations would be interesting (aka in once center all SVHN images are red and the center has a majority of one digit). Are there scaling laws for FL to be preferred to ensembles, aka starting from which critical mass does FL become interesting ? Does it depend on the task ? Is there a good formula to predict the gap between FL and ensembles from say #samples in local centers and alpha ? Does this formula transfer to realistic settings ? What about differential privacy ? For a fixed privacy budget is it better to do ensemble ? This is such an interesting question and there are so few experiments in the paper !\n\nMinor\n\n- The argument on model reusability in the conclusion should be dropped nothing prevents from reusing an iteratively trained model. The argument on easier unlearning for ensembles is a bit far-fetched\n- Fed-Camelyon16 learns on small (and not large) ResNet features extracted from large breast slides (and not brain !). Features are larger than traditional clinical data (relative) but not large (asolute)\n- The reviewers encourage the authors to insist on the privacy aspect of the ensemble methods because the two real gains of FENS in medical settings is easier IT setup and contractualization and better privacy.\n\n\nSummary: the authors study a great question but do not provide enough high-quality experiments and ablation-study for it to be sufficiently interesting for ICLR.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Liu, Kuan, et al. \"Learn to combine modalities in multimodal deep learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.11730 (2018)."

For example, if the client's model has 10K parameters (which is not a lot in cross-silo), and there are 10 clients (also not a lot), then the input dimension itself is 100K, so your aggregator for this simple case will have at the very least 1 billion parameters, which is quite a lot of parameters for some shallow neural net.\n- It might be unfair to compare with methods with no trainable aggregator and no proxy dataset. Perhaps you can compare to a one-shot FL algorithm with a fine-tuned aggregator? You can consider an experiment where you train an MLP aggregator vs. tune the weights of the non-trainable aggregator (i.e. training a linear aggregator) on some proxy dataset. Then you can consider another experiment where you just average the models at the end and simply train the averaged model on the proxy dataset. You should show that using an MLP aggregator is indeed a better way to improve performance. Finally, you should consider the effect of the size of the proxy dataset on the performance because you might not always get a 10% cut of the original data publicly available.\n- I\u2019m not sure about experiment 4.2 and whether it is conclusive or not. You can tell that the increase is larger for FENS, but maybe that\u2019s only because FedAvg was already closer to its top performance. The reason there seems to be a larger increase might be due to the efficiency of FedAvg at learning from fewer samples more than it is due to the efficiency of FENS at learning faster with more samples. Moreover, in this particular experiment, FENS seems to be performing strictly worse than FedAvg in this example, which is not a strong selling point of the method no matter how quickly it improves, especially since the improvement plateaus before it reaches FedAvg."
