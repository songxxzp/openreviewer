It leverages a pre-defined rule (e.g., Arithmetic coding) to compress a sequence based on the conditional probabilistic intervals of its each token. The compressed content can be losslessly restored to the original content based on the decoding rules that reverse the encoding process. The experimental results show an LLM can be very effective to compress content and works as a general-purpose compressor."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While this paper introduces a novel perspective to understand the compression ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), its contribution or novelty is not particularly prominent from a high-level idea/conclusion standpoint.\n\nFirstly, the concept that a language model is a form of compression is not new. As early as 2023, in an interview between Nvidia's Jensen Huang and OpenAI's Ilya Sutskever, Ilya mentioned that a language model learns through compression, and the generative model is essentially a compression of data in the world. This insight is well ingrained among most NLP/LLM professionals. Therefore, although this paper connects sequence prediction and compression from an arithmetic perspective, aside from some interesting experimental results, it doesn't provide practitioners with many new insights, such as in terms of methodology. While its LLM compressor performs well compared to gzip, it is difficult to use in practice due to the high inference cost.\n\nSecondly, I believe a major highlight of this paper is the discussion on general-purpose (trained on text, but can work for other modalities) and scaling (the larger, the better at compression). The overall method of the paper still uses the Arithmetic coding approach. However, prior work has already presented similar observations and conclusions, albeit not from an arithmetic coding perspective. For instance, Ge et al. (2023) proposed using lora tuning to adapt the LLM for the compression ability, enabling it to compress a long context into a short span. Although Ge et al.'s (2023) work is not lossless compression, they observed similar phenomena: for example, their Table 3 comparison of normal text, patterned random text, and completely random text shows that LLMs can compress based on certain patterns (even though the model has not seen patterned random text, it performs better on patterned random text than on completely random text). Similarly, their Tables 5 and 8 also indicate that more potent LLMs are better at compression. Therefore, while I find the perspective of this paper novel and interesting, its final conclusions cannot be considered entirely novel.\n\nDespite these weaknesses, I think this paper's contribution overweigh the weaknesses as a research paper to present in ICLR.\n\nReferences:\n\nGe et al.

It has, e.g., been a core and explicit theme in \"High Dimensional Data Analysis with Low-Dimensional Models: Principles, Computation, and Applications\". As such, shouldn't the paper's title be more specific, such as \"LLMs are general-purpose image & audio compressors\"?\n\n2.  A key into understanding the algorithm is Fig. 1, but the figure contains ambiguities and confusion. E.g. Why a \"?\" in \"b0?\" only? In the last column, how to go from 4bit to 7bit? The illustration should be more tractable.\n\n3. I have doubt about the \"generative\" model part, for the text examples in B.1, the good performance of Chinchilla over gzip is no surprise. But the poor performance on images & audio in Fig. 3 & B.2 indeed shows LLM can't handle these data in general. How can an LLM even be called generative in images/audio if the results make no sense? If that's the case, the last sentence in Abstract shouldn't be made.\n\n4. I am also doubtful about the part on tokenization. The tokenizer being part of a Transformer is only due to its root in language modeling. In the same vein, we can easily make a claim on \"A CNN stem is compression\" (a CNN has a stem, body & head), and varying the stem (e.g. different strides) we get different compression rates too, so what is interesting in that?\n\nEditorial:\nThe line above Sect 3.6, typo \"accross\""

When taking into account the number of model parameters for calculating the compression ratio, the authors illustrate new empirical scaling-laws by plotting the compression ratio as a function of model size, resulting in an U-shaped curve. This scaling law suggests that depending on the size of a dataset the optimal compression ratio is achieved for one specific model size.

I recommend aligning the narrative more cohesively and concluding with a clear takeaway message\n- I find that the background section is more technical than needed to understand the results of the paper. For example, the authors could maybe show on a concrete example how arithmetic coding works instead being very general and introducing a lot of mathematical notations and concepts. Reducing the relatively heavy use of mathematical notation could also help with reading since most of it does not appear again after the background section. Also, in Figure 1 which illustrates arithmetic coding, there are missing explanations (e.g. arrows are not explained) to guide the reader."
