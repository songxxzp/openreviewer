Srikant. \"Finite-time analysis of entropy-regularized neural natural actor-critic algorithm.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.00833 (2022).\n\nCould the authors kindly clarify how the result in this submission differentiates from the one in this paper from 2022?\n\nIn addition, the authors consider the flexibility of allowing non-i.i.d. samples in their analysis as a contribution of this paper, but the following paper, which the authors have already cited, also allows Markovian data. Could the authors shed some light on how the analysis technique used in this paper differs from the one in the following paper? (I understand their result is only for linear function approximation. Does this make a big difference in the part of analysis pertaining to the concentration over non-i.i.d. Markovian data?)\n\nXu, Tengyu, Zhe Wang, and Yingbin Liang. \"Improving sample complexity bounds for (natural) actor-critic algorithms.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 4358-4369.\n\nThe above two questions is mainly concerned with the significance/novelty of this submission.

            "questions": {
                "value": "- What is the architecture of your neural network in Algorithm 1? How does this function class look like? You stated $L$ layers and $m$ neurons per layer in Section 4, but is there any other requirements or specifications? A paragraph that states this more rigorously would be appreciated.\n\n- A related question is: how does the size of your neural network function class or $\\Theta$ affect the variance portion of your final error bound? Your current bound does not show any dependence on it. Could you explain why the upper bound of the expectation of a supremum over $\\Theta$ does not need to depend on the complexity of $\\Theta$ in Equation (110)? Otherwise, if the Rad quantity in (110) actually depends on $\\Theta$, could you explicitly present in your theorem how $C_k$ in your Equation (111) depends on $\\Theta$, as most existing theoretical results do. This is an important aspect of such theoretical results, since taking a covering with a supremum usually compromises the sharpness of the bound. If you'd like to compare with the rates in other theoretical works, it might come across as unfair if your bound does not show this aspect.\n\n- Is there any difference between Algorithm 1 and the procedure you actually use in your theoretical analysis? Algorithm 1 seems to be a practical implementation which uses gradient descent to solve the objective in Equation (11), whereas I believe you assume there is an oracle that can find the global minimizer of (11) in your theoretical analysis. (Otherwise, could you explain how you avoided the non-convexity?) If this is the case, this difference should be made much clearer in the writing, and Theorem 1 should not be claimed as a result for the current Algorithm 1.\n\n- Please let me know if the following is correct: $\\alpha m$ can be $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{poly}(n,L)})$, so the second line of Equation (17) can be viewed as $\\frac{1}{K(1-\\gamma)}\\sum_{k=1}^K\\sum_{j=0}^{J-1}(1 - \\frac{1}{n^2})^n$. Since $(1 - \\frac{1}{n^2})^n$ is monotonically increasing and converges to a constant, is this term on the order of $\\frac{J}{1-\\gamma}$? If this is the case, it is non-decaying.\n\n- What is $\\mu_k$ in Theorem 1? Isn't the loss function in Equation (9) just MSE?\n\n- Could you also explain the following in Remark 3:\n\n> This term is present due to the fact that the optimization for the critic step is non-convex, hence convergence can only be guaranteed with a high probability. We show in the Appendix F that if the critic is represented by a two layer neural network with ReLU activation, using the convex reformulation as laid out in Mishkin et al. (2022), a deterministic upper bound on the error can be obtained.\n\nNormally, the high probability bound is due to the randomness in your samples. Could you explain why you attribute it to the non-convexity? Furthermore, when everything is convex, could you explain why you can obtain a deterministic result, when the samples from Line 5 and 10 of Algorithm 1 are still random?\n\n- Also, the notation $n.J$ in Algorithm 1 and Theorem 1 seems weird. Did you mean to write $n\\cdot J$? Same with other instances of dots.\n\nDespite my serious concerns at the moment, I'm open to raising my score if authors' clarification could clear my questions."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Major questions:\n1.\tPage 3. The definition of Bellman operator. In (3), the authors use one realization of the reward r\u2019(s,a) to define the Bellman operator. This makes (T^\\pi Q)(s,a) a random variable. So, T^\\pi Q^\\pi = Q^\\pi does not hold. Maybe the authors can consider the setting when the reward is deterministic, otherwise there is a lot to fix. A more challenging alternative is to redefine the Bellman operator with r\u2019(s,a) replaced by its conditional expectation. As a follow up, when T^\\pi Q is not deterministic, \\eps_{approx} in Assumption 4 could be as large as O(1) according to the variance of the reward. In this case, Theorem 1 becomes meaningless. As another follow up, in page 8 eqn (24), Lemma 2 of Munos (2003) is also for deterministic reward.\n2.\tPage 4 before (8). The authors use the property of compatible function approximation, which is an extremely strong assumption for neural network parametrization. According to Sutton, this means \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial \\lambda} / \\pi. And Sutton also points out (in the paper that the author cited) that \u201cQ being linear in the features may be the only way to satisfy this condition\u201d. On the one hand, this assumption is too strong to make the work practical. On the other hand, there is no critic parametrization until eqn (10). So, I think a normal version of the policy gradient theorem (theorem 1 in the ref) is enough.\n3.\tTheorem 1 (and also Lemma 7). The authors give no description or assumption on \\mu_k. Therefore, the constants for big O in the theorem depend on \\mu_k, and hence depend on K. This makes the theorem meaningless. I would suggest giving a positive lower bound for \\mu_k. Please note that \\mu_k is also the lower bound for the (eigenvalue of the) Fisher information matrix (7), which guarantees that F is invertible.\n4.\tLemma 6. According to the description of Lemma 6, there is no randomness in (50) and I don\u2019t see why \u201cwith high probability\u201d is needed. My understanding is that (50) left is not an expectation, but a conditional expectation only w.r.t. the RL problem. The randomness comes from the initialization of neural network etc. However, the authors give no description of the network (except the width). I believe inequality like (50) could only hold when one gives a very explicit setting for everything. Please clarify the setting with details so that we can justify the application of the referenced theorems.\n5.\tProof of theorem 1. Eqn (56) is not consistent with line 20 in the algorithm. There should be a coefficient 1/(1-\\gamma). I think the statement of theorem 1 need modification accordingly, because you are tracking the dependence on 1/(1-\\gamma). (58)-(60), when you define err_k, do you mean to use A^{\\pi_{\\labmda_k}} instead of A_{k,J}? Otherwise, it is not consistent with (66). \n\nMinor questions:\n1.\tPage 2. The sentence \u201cthe non-convexity of the critic can be avoided if we use the natural policy gradient algorithm\u201d is not clear. What do you mean by \u201cthe non-convexity of the critic\u201d? Natural policy gradient is the actor algorithm, why does it resolve the problem for the critic?\n2.\tPage 2 Related works: actor-critic methods. I think papers like \u201cProvably global convergence of actor-critic: A case for linear quadratic regulator with ergodic cost\u201d (NIPS2019) and \u201cSingle Timescale Actor-Critic Method to Solve the Linear Quadratic Regulator with Convergence Guarantees\u201d (JMLR2023) are also related.\n3.\tPage 3. Why does the stationary distribution \\rho^\\pi_\\nu depend on the initial distribution \\nu, especially when Assumption 2 holds?\n4.\tPage 4. The definition of natural policy gradient method. I believe that the dagger means inverse of pseudo-inverse of the matrix. It should not appear in eqn (7), where the Fisher information matrix is defined. Also, please clarify the dagger notation.    \n5.\tPage 4. Please give the full name of DQN when it first appears.\n6.\tPage 6 after (15). In Xu and Gu (2020), I did not find the assumption described in the paper.\n7.\tProof of theorem 1. (53)(54) looks unnecessary when you have (55)(56). (54) looks wrong. (58) should be >= instead of <=? Eqn (58) to (59) has nothing to do with the performance difference lemma, maybe you mean eqn (59) to (60)? (59) first line, should use the advantage function instead of the Q function? (59) second line, should be + instead of -? Eqn (63), why does k goes to J-1 instead of K? Also, in (63), \\pi_{\\lambda_0} should be \\pi_{\\lambda_1}?

                "value": "- The paper extends previous on natural actor critic to the case of multi-layer neural network and studies the sample complexity of the algorithm. The theoretical study is solid.\n- The presentation of the paper is great.\n- The paper relaxes the assumptions of previous study of natural actor critic. In particular, the paper does not require i.i.d. sampling."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The paper does not provide any empirical study on the algorithm and does not discuss on the empirical implicaiton.\n- The authors claim that they are the first to show the sample complexity of natural actor critic algorithms with neural networks. However, to my understanding, the asymptotic converge result in Wang et al, 2019 and Fu et al, 2020 can be converted to an upper bound on the sample complexity directly. Given that, the contribution in this study is rather incremental.\n- Missing reference:\nAgarwal, Alekh, et al. \"On the theory of policy gradient methods: Optimality, approximation, and distribution shift.\" The Journal of Machine Learning Research 22.1 (2021): 4431-4506."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- In Theorem 1, $J.n$ should be written as $J\\cdot n$. \n- The paper does not present a detailed description on how to parameterize the Q function and the policy with neural network in the main part of the paper. A detailed description or a hyper-link to it is helpful.\n- The analysis and the error rate of the neural network seems to lie in the regime of neural tangent kernel. Papers on neural tangent kernel should be cited properly. Here are a few examples:\n  - Jacot, Arthur, Franck Gabriel, and Cl\u00e9ment Hongler. \"Neural tangent kernel: Convergence and generalization in neural networks.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 31 (2018)."
