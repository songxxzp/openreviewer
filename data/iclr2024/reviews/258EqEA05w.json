The main challenge in FL is data heterogeneity, which leads to feature shift due to different underlying distributions of local datasets. While previous studies have focused on addressing this issue through model optimization or aggregation, few have paid attention to the data itself. FedRDN addresses this by randomly injecting the statistics of the dataset from the entire federation into the client's data, improving the generalization of features and mitigating feature shift. The method is simple, effective, and can be seamlessly integrated into the data augmentation flow. Experimental results demonstrate its scalability and generalizability. The document also provides a summary of related work in FL with statistical heterogeneity and data augmentation techniques."
