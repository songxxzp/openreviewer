In the field of vector search, the performance of LSH has been overwhelmed by vector quantization [1] and proximity graph [2] techniques by orders of magnitude in recent years. Pls check the two seed papers and the numerous papers that cite them. Although this fact may not be well known in the field of audio retrieval, I wonder a whether a simple adaption of proximity graph outperforms SOTA LSH methods for audio retrieval. The authors may consider switch to the latest techniques to vector search. Note that, vector quantization also has variants that use end-to-end training similar to this paper.\n\n[1] Product Quantization for Nearest Neighbor Search\n[2] Efficient and Robust Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search Using Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs (HNSW)\n\n2.\tNovelty is unclear. Section 3.1 uses contrastive learning to enlarge the distance gap between similar and dissimilar item pairs. This methodology is widely used in machine learning, and the authors should clarify the unique designs for audio retrieval. The core contribution seems to be using normalizing flow to ensure that the items are evenly distributed among the hash buckets. Again, the bucket balance constraint is widely recognized to be important and considered by many related works. Pls refer to the references in [1]. The authors should clarify the differences and advantages of normalizing flow over alternative bucket balance techniques.\n\n[1] A Survey on Learning to Hash\n\n3.\tExperiments need to be improved. (1) Pls report the dataset statistics in a table, e.g., the number of items and the dimension. (2) When evaluating efficiency, pls use the query processing time. Currently, using the number of searched items cannot consider the costs of the encoding and hashing operations; plus that query processing time affects user experience more directly. (3) Pls use the time-recall curve to compare different methods, and an example can be found in the HNSW paper. Currently, Tabe 1 aligns neither the query time nor the recall of the methods, which makes it different to compare different methods. (4) Include the model training time of the proposed method."

Compared to an unstructured (unsupervised) hashing approach, their approach appears to be more beneficial as the search process is more streamlined. For the audio retrieval application, they proposed a three-step hashing process, where the first two are dedicated to learning representations from the sequence and then reduce to the dimensionality, while the third flow model makes sure that the final hash codes follow the organized bimodal distribution, thus making quantization easy. The experimental results show improvement although they are not significant."

For example, semantic hashing and LSH have this property that similar examples (either perceptually or from the application's perspective) tend to collide more often. In some audio retrieval tasks, this property might not be necessary, but it must be nice if the paper discusses this aspect, as to whether the proposed model results in these semantically relevant codes.\n\n- The main weakness of the experimental results is, actually, the misrepresentation of the bold numbers in Table 1. It seems that the authors use bold characters to represent the best-performing model for each configuration, and the proposed model was chosen oftentimes, misleading the readers. However, with a careful examination, I was able to see that TE+LSH is the winner many times. It seems that TE+NF still slightly outperforms other methods in the noise-only case, but in other noise+reverb or reverb-only cases, TE+LSH is the clear winner. I believe that this is a critical mistake and the discussions and conclusion should be fixed accordingly."

It appears that the proposed method relies heavily on the \"exact match\" scenario, which is also a legitimate application. Any additional explanation on this issue? This is also relevant to my other point about semantic hashing. \n\n- The NF results are regularized to be a bimodal normal distribution. During training, these distributions are fixed with pre-defined mean and variances. Any chance this rigid definition could harm the hashing performance?"

Specifically, both papers leverage a Transformer-based encoder, which has already been extensively explored in the context of the prior work. The main extensions in this work over Singh et al. (2023) are the use of normalizing flows and the incorporation of the BCE loss. While these are indeed differences, since they are commonly used in other areas such as CV and NLP, their introduction might not be substantial enough to be considered groundbreaking.\n\nW2. **Marginal Improvement over Accuracy:**\nThe paper highlights the capabilities of FlowHash in reducing retrieval candidates and enhancing robustness. These are undoubtedly important aspects in many practical applications. However, a critical metric for many machine learning tasks, particularly in the retrieval task, is accuracy. Based on the presented experimental results, it appears that the accuracy gains from using FlowHash are marginal. In some cases, e.g., from Tables 1 and 2, there might even be a trade-off where accuracy is sacrificed.\n\nW3. **Extended Experiments:**\nIt might contain bias and becomes less convincing to conduct the experiments through a single dataset. \nMoreover, while the paper emphasizes reduced memory overhead, it doesn't delve deep into the space overhead introduced by the hashing mechanism.\n\nW4: **Incorrect Highlighted Results:**\nIn Tables 1 and 2, the authors have used bold fonts to signify the best results across different query lengths and varying levels of Noise and Reverberation. However, upon close inspection, there appear to be inconsistencies in the highlighted results, with several best values not being bolded correctly. Such incorrectly highlighted results can lead readers to draw wrong conclusions about the performance of the proposed method or its competitors."

It will be beneficial to showcase the claim of memory reduction.\n\nRegarding W4:\n\nQ3: The authors should meticulously review Tables 1 and 2 to ensure that the best results are correctly highlighted.
