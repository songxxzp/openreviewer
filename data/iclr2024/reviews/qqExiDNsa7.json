While the authors claim to explore the influence of pre-trained models on the separation task, the paper appears more akin to a two-stage training paradigm leveraging contrastive learning. Conventionally, pre-trained models refer to general-purpose speech models, such as Wav2vec and WavLM.\n2. The two core contributions of this paper are the pre-trained model using contrastive learning and the deep modularization network. Firstly, I believe the authors should demonstrate the significance of the pre-trained model for the separation task. The authors displayed in Table 1 the impact of different pre-trained inputs on performance when using a deep modularization network. This perspective might be narrow, as it may be specifically tailored for this network structure. Comparative evaluations with other separation networks like Conv-TasNet and DPRNN are warranted. Secondly, the authors should contrast the use of existing pre-trained models combined with the deep modularization network to underscore the network's significance.\n3. The authors' claim of using an unsupervised method seems to be imprecise. During the pre-training phase, the Encoder has already acquired all the single speaker information from the training set. If the approach were genuinely unsupervised, the mixed signals should be used during the pre-training phase.\n4. The paper contains some typographical errors and figure reference inaccuracies. For instance, all equations should be followed by punctuation, \"equation 3\" in Figure 1 should be \"equation 2\", and in Section 4, \"$A_{ij}$ iff\" should be corrected to \"if\". I hope the authors can meticulously address these mistakes."

Given that the authors utilized speech signals with noise and reverberation as inputs for the pre-trained model, can their method separate mixed signals that contain noise or reverberation? For instance, have experiments been conducted on datasets like WHAM! or WHAMR!?\n2. I perceive the clustering parameter 'k' as a pivotal hyperparameter. Is it possible to evaluate the model's performance under various 'k' values?\n3. Considering that, for example, TF-GridNet can achieve an SI-SNRi=23.4 on WSJ0-2mix, the authors' method of pre-training followed by separation is inherently more intricate. How do the authors rationalize this complexity?\n4. The datasets used by the authors have a 100% overlap. Does the deep modularization network proposed by the authors remain viable for data with varying degrees of overlap?"

These omissions are significant as these works also concluded the beneficial impact of noise and reverberation.\n\n- Lack of Baseline System: The paper is not able to provide baseline performance for the comparable downstream speech separation model.

                "value": "In terms of clarity, I find the paper difficult to understand. One major point of confusion is the use of the term \"frame\" to, I believe, refer to individual spectrogram points. A frame of a spectrogram is an entire column, so it is not clear whether it is spectrogram points or spectrogram columns that are being clustered. Based on the results, I assume it is points, because clustering columns would not produce sufficient speech enhancement, but, for example, section 6.1 states \"we divide a given speech in the training set into frames (chunks) of size 250 with 125 overlap between two subsequent frames.\" No units are provided for these numbers, but they appear to be columns of spectrograms. This critical detail is very unclear.\n\nAdditionally, the title of the paper suggests that existing pre-trained models (e.g., wav2vec 2.0) will be compared for speech separation. The abstract further argues that existing pre-trained models are trained on clean speech and so have trouble representing mixed speech. This line of reasoning is quickly abandoned, however, and a new model trained on a relatively small corpus is introduced instead of a large self-supervised model.\n\nSeveral different loss functions are introduced, and it is not clear when each one is used.\n\nThe results tables from the appendix should be included in the main text because they include comparisons to baseline systems. The current tables need not be included and could be replaced by these.\n\n## Minor comments\n\nThe paper contains no paragraph breaks, making it unfriendly to read. The paper would be improved by removing some of the less relevant literature review to make space for proper spacing. Additionally, citations are all \\cite{}, which are rendered as \"Isik et al. (2016)\" even when the entire citation should be in the parentheses. This effect can be achieved by instead using \\citep{}, which will be rendered as \"(Isik et al., 2016)\".\n\nThe spacing around | | at the beginning of section 4 is very odd."
