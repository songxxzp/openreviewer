Unrealistic assumption of access to the environment source codes:\n\nThe reward code generation in this paper critically depends on having access to the source code of the MDP specification as context for the initial reward proposal. The authors have presented this as a benefit, allowing the LLM to exploit code structure to understand task environments. However, it makes an unrealistic assumption, as most reinforcement learning setups only require access to a black-box simulation. \n\nA significant limitation of this approach is that it may be infeasible for real-world robotic tasks where the transition function may either be unavailable or in different analytical forms. Given the heavy dependence on source code for task environment understanding, this method could be essentially restricted to simulated RL environments only.\n\n2. Strong assumption on the fitness function F(.)\n\nAnother weak point is the strong assumption on the fitness function F(.). The evolutionary search for the LLM generated reward function requires a fitness function capable of assessing the quality of each proposed reward function. In this work, the fitness function F(.) is implicitly assumed to have access to the ground truth reward function to evaluate the induced policies of the proposed reward functions. This limitation implies that the method is applicable only to tasks that come with known ground-truth reward functions. This weakens the method's practical applicability, restricting it mainly to idealized or known environments, hindering its usefulness for real-world, less predictable reinforcement learning tasks."

Is it due to an effective reward design, which is the paper's main focus, or is it a byproduct of unspecified engineering efforts? Section 4.3 is not very clear and leaves room for several pertinent questions:\n\n1. The paper does not detail how the pre-trained policy was obtained. The statement, \"Specifically, we first instruct EUREKA to generate a reward for ... Then, using this pre-trained policy,\" leaves the readers wondering what exactly \"this\" references to. \n\nThe application of curriculum learning here appears to break the policy training into two main stages - an initial 'pre-training' stage and a 'fine-tuning' stage with the pre-trained policy. If this interpretation is accurate, clarity around the following is crucial:\n\n2. Is the training process \u2013 both pre-training and fine-tuning stages \u2013 guided by the reward functions derived using the LLM-powered reward design method proposed in this paper? Are these reward functions identical?\n\n -  If they are, there needs to be a detailed explanation of the distinctiveness of 'pre-training' and 'fine-tuning' when it comes to the optimization of policies under the same reward function. The reason how a dual-stage policy optimization can notably enhance policy performance remains under-explained. Additionally, if this is the case, it appears that the success of the task may be due to the dual-stage policy optimization rather than the reward design, casting doubts about the central argument of the paper.\n\n -  If they're not, clarity is needed on how these varying reward functions are generated, and what differences exist between them. Furthermore, how does this dual-stage reward function model vary from the primary algorithm proposed? How to ascertain the number of reward functions sufficient for a given task?"

One example to illustrate this problem: The subsection on evolutionary search provides no detail on what is the exact input, outputs, or about the specific method being used. This is one core aspect of the proposed approach, and would require more details to be understandable. I understand some parts of this appear in the appendix or will be clear from code release, but the main part should make the core parts of the approach more clear.\n\nIn the Eureka algorithm description, it is a bit unclear to me what the reward reflection part does; for example the algorithm specifies the reward functions and their evaluations are provided as inputs, but the text also talks about the choices of RL method that are important for this part. There's only little information in the text that tells me how it works.\n\nSimilarly, I like the idea of \"environment as context\", but it would be good to know what is considered here as environment (what does it mean), for example to what level of detail does the environment need to be described / down to what level do you have to go. The appendix describes that, due to limited context length, the only the observation context will be used, but for simulators different from Isaac, what information do you expect you need to provide for this to work.\n\nThis could be connected with a missing discussion of limitations of the approach, for example do you expect this approach to be useful when you do not have full access to the code of the environment but maybe just some API, or if the environment is the real world.\n\nMaybe more philosophically but I am also not quite sure about the classification of the generation as \"zero-shot\" as it is unclear what the LLM has actually seen during training, and it would be interesting to see further investigations of this (not necessarily in this work) and capabilities of transferring domain knowledge - the release of benchmarks after the cut-off doesn't necessarily mean there was no environment like this before.\n\nMost of the above weaknesses impact the presentation of the work; while formal presentation of the work is good overall, Figure 2 and Figure 3 could be improved for contrast and font sizes."

While the authors claim the generality of Eureka, the proposed approach has only been evaluated on a single base simulator (Isaac Gym) and with a fixed RL algorithm. In other words, the claim seems to be overstated. \n\nAnother weakness is the experiment part, while the submitted text showcases different (and relevant) comparisons with human results, the human rewards are zero-shot and not tuned for many RL trials to further improve the performance. Therefore, I believe the comparison may be unfair. If you tune the human rewards in this baseline (e.g. search the weights for different reward terms) and train RL for many trials (same as the cost of the evolutionary search in Eureka ), some claims may not hold.\n\nA specific discussion I missed was about how the proposed approach handles the difference between optimizing for the internals of the simulation vs its sensing/acting interface. The former should be avoided in any general approach. The authors claim to use an \"automatic script to extract just the observation portion of the environment source code\", but this doesn't necessarily guarantee no leaks or that such observation code abstraction level leaks details.\n\nMoreover, as the proposed approach depends on feeding the environment code to the LLM, besides just claiming the \"the observation portion of the environment\", I believe a more in-depth discussion is needed on how Eureka could be adapted to a) more complex environments, which may be too large for the model context windows; and b) scenarios of interaction with the real world (actual robot control).\n\nParticularly for a), this is a critically important discussion. E.g., What would be the impact on the pen spinning demo with more detailed material characteristics and physics (friction, inertia, actuator latencies, etc.)?\n\nThe authors also claim only a \"handful\" of LLM output is enough. However, 16 is hardly a handful (<5). Intuitively the number of samples to obtain one fully executable policy will grow in proportion to simulator and environment complexity. However, again there is no discussion of such limitations of the approach."
