Experimental results show that NeuralFuse can reduce SRAM memory access energy by up to 20-30% while recovering accuracy by up to 57% at a 1% bit error rate."

It needs some justification on this trade-off.\n\n3.\tThe method seems to be equivalent to adding extra layers in the early stage of the network and train it with noise-aware training. Why not train other layers with the memory error? It is not very intuitive that weight errors in all layers (even MSB flips) can be well protected by only changing the model input. More explanation is needed to justify this. Can we add a protector to later layers and do some calibration? Or even parallel branches? Or protect the weights loaded from memory block-wise, which can still maintain model-agnostic?"

The true efficacy of power savings from the low-voltage operation remains ambiguous. While Table 2 highlights energy savings, it narrowly focuses on the consumption related to SRAM accesses. Given that the large configurations of NeuralFuse exhibit similar MACs to the base models (as seen in Table 7), the feasibility of NeuralFuse, when accounting for its total overhead, merits reconsideration.\n\n3.
