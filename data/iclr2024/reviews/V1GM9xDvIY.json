The authors then provide a series of experiments demonstrating the applicability of their proposed method.

Additionally the authors mention that this is a novel latent SDE formulation but most of the methodologies follow existing methods using a change of measure (e.g. Li et al among others). \n\nThe numerical results were applied to fairly low dimensional datasets though it seems like the work could be applied to higher dimensional settings (as some of the related work applied to higher dimensional settings).\n\nTo summarize, I think I'm mainly confused as to what is different in this work compared to existing works since it's methodologically similar and the theoretical results are also similar. From what I've understood, it's mainly that the graph structure dictating the interaction is explicit."

How would the methods compare if the authors applied this technique to existing methods that estimate latent SDEs?\n\nDo the authors have an idea of how the performance scales to higher dimensional observations?"
