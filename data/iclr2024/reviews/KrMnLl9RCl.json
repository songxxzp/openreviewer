Thus, I do not see too much novelty in the current proposed method.\n\n2) The method is only evaluated on 5 datasets whose feature numbers are very small, which may not be sufficient to reflect the dataset we typically encounter in real-world applications. So I would suggest the authors add more experiments on datasets with large dimensions. Also, only one performance metric is used, which may not tell the whole story and introduce bias. And the comparisons of some traditional-machine-learning-based imputation methods are missed. For example, this paper [Ref1] lists a lot of performance metrics and also a lot of imputation methods.\n\n3) Still about the evaluation pipeline, the performance did not outperform other methods in a lot of testing cases.\n\n4) Another question or one evaluation I would like to see: even if there are differences in the \"filled-in\" missing values across different methods, does the lower NRMSE necessary indicate a higher downstream-task performance? I mean, for example, what will happen if we apply a downstream task (say, a classification task) to these imputed datasets, how much performance difference we would expect in the classification accuracy?\n\n5) The authors should also mention other imputation methods (like methods using traditional machine learning) in Related Work besides the GAN-based and VAE-based ones.\n\n6) Based on the loss function and the framework Fig.1, it looks like Formula (5) is not correct.\n\n\nRef1: Emmanuel, Tlamelo, et al. \"A survey on missing data in machine learning.\" Journal of Big Data 8.1 (2021): 1-37."

In equation (6), the DAE includes a mask matrix as part of its input. Could the authors clarify if this is a standard approach for DAEs and if the artificial mask matrix (M bar) is intended to help the model differentiate between real and artificially introduced missing data?\n\n5. Given the introduction of synthetic missing values during training, the manuscript should address how the model accounts for the potential distribution shift compared to the test data which lacks these artificial missing values.\n\n6. When Missing Not At Random (MNAR) data is addressed, especially as outlined in Appendix A.1, how does the model manage instances where selected features for artificial missingness are also naturally missing? Does the model incorporate a mechanism to prevent learning to discriminate between real and synthetic missing values?\n\n7. Considering the moderate size of the datasets utilized, could the authors justify their choice of validation method? Would multi-fold cross-validation not be a more suitable approach to assess model performance robustly?\n\n8. The manuscript briefly mentions the utilization of overcomplete representations in Section 5.6.3. Could the authors discuss the trade-offs involved with this approach, particularly concerning model complexity and the potential for overfitting?\n\n9. In scenarios where GAN components provide incremental gains as mentioned in Section 5.6.2, could the authors provide further insights into the conditions that favor their inclusion and offer recommendations on optimizing these components for consistent improvements?"

The DC-DAE augments inputs with two types of corruptions during training (masking and additive noise), which helps the model generalize better to unseen missing patterns. The method also employs a balanced loss function that allows tunable trade-offs between reconstructing artificial missing and denoising observed values. The DC-DAE architecture avoids the complexity of attention mechanisms or adversarial training, aiming for simplicity and effectiveness."

                "value": "The originality of this paper, which proposes a method for data imputation using dual corruption strategies, may not be seen as highly innovative. The techniques of masking and adding noise have been well-explored in deep learning research as data augmentation techniques. Although the paper combines these techniques with a balanced loss function, it does not verify the originality of this paper. If you add Gaussian noise and masking to enlarge the dataset, it would help to improve the performance of all models. It would be great to clarify how it differentiates from data augmentation techniques."

                "value": "1. On page 4, the notation for noise 'e' should be distinguished from regular text using a special character or formatting.\n\n2. Section 5.6.1 needs clearer explanations. It should clearly explain why different sample sizes are used and what the numbers in the table mean. The figure shows many numbers, but the explanation doesn't analyze it comprehensively and quantitatively.\n\n3. For clarity and presentation, center Figures 3 and 4 in the document. Additionally, the numerical data within Figures 2, 3, and 4 need to be larger for easier readability.\n\n4. The analysis of Table 2 could be more detailed. For example, why does DC-VAE not perform well in the Glass and Spam dataset?\n\n5. What is the difference between the proposed method and data augmentation?"
