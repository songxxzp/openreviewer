It is noticeable that several amendments, which were assured to the four reviewers, are absent in the current version presented at ICLR 2024. I strongly suggest that the authors should revise the manuscripts as promised either in a camera-ready version if accepted, or the next submission or arxiv if rejected this time.\n\nIn this paper, the capabilities of the \"Pointer-Augmented Neural Memory (PANM)\" system are extensively explored, demonstrating its proficiency in managing long data sequences through the integration of an external memory that operates on physical addressing. The system significantly enhances the performance of RNNs/Transformers in reasoning tasks. PANM achieves this by employing pointers for memory content retrieval and mastering a variety of operations via comprehensive end-to-end training, as is validated by experimental results."

Its performance in broader applications is unconvincing, focusing mainly on QA tasks already validated by other networks. A wider range of NLU and NLG tasks is needed to prove its versatility and value.\n\n2. The baselines used for comparison are outdated, and large language models (LLMs) with over 10B parameters could outperform the proposed method on reasoning tasks. The paper should either compare the method with these LLMs or show how PANM enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities. \n\n3. The paper downplays the similarities between PANM and the Transformer, particularly in terms of positional encodings and attention computations. The current notation makes these connections unclear, and the paper should work to make them more explicit. By presenting PANM as a modification of the Transformer, rather than something entirely different, the distinctions and innovations of PANM could be more easily understood. The choice of notation, such as using h and g instead of query and key, further obscures the connection, and should be addressed to enhance clarity."

                "value": "Systematic generalization is the ability of a model to recognize and apply abstract rules to novel contexts that are semantically similar to the training data. Existing models tend to overfit the training data and perform poorly on out-of-distribution samples, such as longer sequences or sequences with novel compositions. The paper discusses the challenge of achieving compositional generalization in neural networks and the proposal of a novel memory architecture called Pointer-Augmented Neural Memory (PANM) to address this issue. \n\nThe work proposes a pointer-based mechanism inspired by both the human brain's symbolic processing through variable binding and computer programs' use of pointers to dynamically access data and programs. PANM explicitly models pointers as physical addresses and strictly isolates pointer manipulation from input data. PANM incorporates a memory structure similar to RAM in Von Neumann's architecture, where each memory slot consists of data and address components. The addresses are generated to explicitly simulate physical memory addresses, allowing for better generalization to longer sequences. To manipulate a pointer, the authors introduce an address bank containing physical addresses corresponding to the input sequence and a neural network called the Pointer Unit responsible for transforming pointers based on attention to the address bank. The paper describes two modes of pointer-based access: pointer dereference (Mode-1) and relational access (Mode-2). \n\nThe authors demonstrate the effectiveness of PANM in symbol-processing domains, including algorithms and context-free grammars, where it works seamlessly with LSTM and StackRNN. PANM is also applied to improve generalization in Transformer models on tasks such as compositional learning, SCAN, and mathematics datasets. The paper concludes the importance of integrating fundamental generalizing principles into existing deep learning models to address their limitations in systematic generalization."

Is the point here to show PANM also helps transformers on NLP tasks? Or, can a broader claim be made that PAN can also perform better than existing transformer based approaches that perform well on the considered NLP tasks?\n- How many parameters does PANM add?

It is not obvious to me what effects this will have\u2014 could you please elaborate on it?
