The authors demonstrate the significant influence of the sample size on the interpretation, such as saliency maps, in deep neural networks. Then they derive two generalization bounds for common gradient-based interpretation techniques by using the analysis presented in Bartlett et al. (2017). Notably, for SmoothGrad, they show that the generalization error of interpretation has a linear decrease with the standard deviation of the SmoothGrad noise. The paper complements these findings with numerical results demonstrating the impact of training sample size on interpretation outcomes."

                "value": "1. Regarding the definition of $f^*$ in Eq.(5):\nFirstly, there is no guarantee that you only have one such optimal classifier. In the case where Eq.(5) returns a set of $f^*$, doesn't the definition of loss in Eq.(6) become problematic? While all the $f^*$ will yield the same testing performance, they do not necessarily produce the same output for the interpretation method. In other words, $\\mathrm{Loss}_I(f,x)$ is also a function of $f^*$, denoted as $\\mathrm{Loss}_I(f^*,f,x)$. This differs significantly from studying standard generalization error. Therefore, the generalization error defined in Eq.(6) can vary for the same $f$ and $x$. \n\n2. Another question arises in this context. Considering that there could be multiple $f^*$ with identical testing performance, and they may not produce the same saliency maps, why does it matter if the saliency maps are influenced by the training data? Is there any guarantee that different $f^*\\in\\mathcal{F}$ with different weight parameters will return identical outputs from the interpolation methods (for the same $x$)?\n\n3. Let's assume there is only one such $f^*$. According to Theorem 1, the generalization bound implies that interpretation demands a larger training set compared to the standard classification problem. An essential mystery in the success of deep learning is that overparameterized neural networks can generalize well without needing more data than the number of parameters. If Simple Gradient Method and Integrated Gradient prove to be unreliable with the same amount of data, does this imply that they are ineffective for interpreting deep neural networks?\n\n4. What is the fundamental implication of establishing generalization bounds for gradient-based interpretation methods when we cannot ensure good performance on the training data? In the context of standard generalization error, we can say an upper bound is provided to guide the minimization of empirical risk while controlling key quantities in the bound.  However, for interpretation methods, let $\\hat{f}^*$ be the empirical minimizer for a given training dataset, even if standard training leads to $f_w\\to\\hat{f}^*$, $\\mathrm{Loss}_I(\\hat{f}^*,x)=||I(\\hat{f}^*,x)-I(f^*,x)||_2$ can still be large. In other words, we lack clarity on whether interpretation methods might overfit to the training data (in the sense defined in Eq.(5)). In light of this uncertainty, discussing regularization is not feasible at this point."

                "value": "I find the main problem the paper is trying to address somewhat contrived. Firstly, the usual motivation for post-hoc explanation of deep networks is to explain the prediction of a **given** network (trained or otherwise) on a **given** sample, as we get insights as to why a particular decision was made. From this perspective, I do not see the motivation to study how well the input gradients will generalize from train set to test set (in expectation). Why are we interested in knowing the MSE loss between our current network an the optimal network as defined in eq(6). \n\nContinuing on my first point, the authors further claim \"the generalization condition is necessary for a proper interpretation result on test samples, it is still not sufficient for a satisfactory interpretation performance\". I fail to appreciate this statement since it is not clear satisfactory interpretation (as defined by the authors) is the gradient-based saliency map generated for our optimal f* that minimizes the population loss. In my opinion, this is of little interest from the perspective of understand why a given network made a particular decision. I invite the authors to convince me otherwise. \n\nLastly, post-hoc explanations have been criticized for some time now in the community due to their reliability in explaining deep network presentations [1,2,3] (some of the references analyze the saliency map techniques evaluated in this work). This means that even if I had the **exact** same saliency map as the ground truth f*, methods like integrated gradients and simple gradients are simply unreliable in explaining what the deep network is doing. \n\nGiven, the above three arguments I fail to appreciate the utility of studying the generalization of saliency maps for deep networks. \n\nLastly, I find the experiment section not clearly written. I expand on this in specific questions below. \n\n1. Adebayo, J., Gilmer, J., Muelly, M., Goodfellow, I., Hardt, M., & Kim, B. (2018). Sanity checks for saliency maps.

The caption says \"we observe that model pairs generate increasingly consistent interpretations.\" It is not clear o me what is being compared here for consistent interpretation? Since f* (the optimal classifier) is never accessible to us. What is the baseline here then?\n\n2. The following statement is unclear \"We train a neural net for every data subset\nfor 200 epochs. To further improve the interpretation generalization, we allow models to train on\n\u201cmore data\u201d by using pre-trained ImageNet weights, then fine-tuning for 50 epochs.\" Why are we training for 200 epochs and then taking Pretrained weights and fine-tuning for 50 more epochs? Do we start with the fine tuned weights and train for 250 epochs. This should be made clear. \n\n3. The following is unclear \"On test set data, we plot\nthe normalized Spearman correlation of network interpretations against softmax predictions.\" What exactly is the equations for this computation? Is the softmax predictions the argmax of the softmax or the entire k dimensional softmax scores? What are the two quantities among which the correlation is computed?"
