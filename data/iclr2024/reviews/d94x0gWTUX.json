            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**Weakness 1**: One of my main concerns is lack of experiments on standard reward modeling datasets. There are many datasets not included in the paper such as the Anthropic HH dataset, Stack Overflow, OpenAI WebGPT, and ChatGPT comparisons datasets. They do conduct analysis on a small portion of the HH dataset, but not on the provided testing set. In addition, they show worst test accuracy than is reported in some other papers that only use conventional reward modeling [1]. Since the main claim of the paper is that by using tools they can improve the accuracy of reward models, I think their method should be validated on these popular datasets.\n\n[1] Dong, Hanze, et al. \"Raft: Reward ranked finetuning for generative foundation model alignment.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.06767 (2023).\n\n**Weakness 2**: Little Hyperparameter study. THEMIS introduces various hyperparameters, but the sensitivity of model performance to these hyperparameters is not discussed.\n\n**Weakness 3**: This paper does not discuss a significant limitation of this method: the difficulty of creating the dataset. The dataset creation process consists of various complex steps, involves tool selection and design of heuristics. This seems to be difficult to scale to large scale preference datasets.\n\n\n**Weakness 4**: I think that this paper could use a more in depth discussion of related works. In particular, various works have attempted to use similar tools such as a compiler in the reward design process [2,3,4,5] and [4] use it to guide the reward model training. Discussing these works could help better frame the contribution of this work.\n\n[2] Le, Hung, et al. \"Coderl: Mastering code generation through pretrained models and deep reinforcement learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 21314-21328.\n\n[3] Shen, Bo, et al. \"Pangu-coder2: Boosting large language models for code with ranking feedback.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.14936 (2023).\n\n[4] Bukharin, Alexander, et al. \"Deep Reinforcement Learning from Hierarchical Weak Preference Feedback.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.02632 (2023).\n\n[5] Shojaee, Parshin, et al. \"Execution-based code generation using deep reinforcement learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.13816 (2023)."

At least in the examples, it looks like there is a risk of biasing the reward model and generative model to outputs of specific tools being used. This could be concerning as tools are not necessarily unbiased.\n\n2- It is not entirely clear how GPT-4 is used to generate RM training data. Note that GPT-4 itself is a system if the proposal is to use GPT-4 to train RM, one can argue why not directly train RM on GPT-4 data or use GPT-4 directly as reward model.\n\n3- When alpha in eq. 2 is set to zero, we converge to typical tool use via simple prompting right? the RM is still a pretrained model and can be prompted to use tools even without explicit loss terms on tool use. Is this understanding correct?\n\n4- Model size of 7B is quite small to capture knowledge to compete with the tools used in this paper. I think a more realistic setup would be to take a larger model and the gap between say Wiki tool and that result could look very different.\n\n5- I think the write-up could improve, especially for Sec 3.1, I had difficulty understanding exactly how GPT-4 was used and how training data was prepared"
