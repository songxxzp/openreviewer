This property, however, is never used in their proofs.\n\n(2). The interaction scheme between the verifier and the prover is confusing. Since the verifier is deterministic, any multi-round interaction protocol can be transformed into a single round interaction protocol with the same amount of communication complexity, i.e., the prover can send everything to the verifier at the very beginning of the protocol, since they can simulate the deterministic actions of the verifier.\n\n2. This paper only discussed the deterministic verification complexity of (uniform) Goldstein stationary point. However, from my vantage point, it appears that a randomized protocol may be a more general and intuitive choice, given that randomness is not a scarce resource for machine learning algorithms. Also, in a randomized protocol, the interaction scheme described in Definition 6 and 7 makes more sense, since in this case a multi-round interaction is indeed much powerful than a one-round interaction. The authors should provide further clarification and justification for their choice to focus on the deterministic model.\n\n3.

One direct consequence of these definitions is that the hardness of weak verification implies the hardness of strong verification and finding stationary points (as shown in Lemma 2). The authors demonstrate that efficient deterministic strong verification is achievable by simply applying Caratheodory's theorem. They also argue that weakly verifying a uniform Goldstein stationary point requires an exponential number of queries.

If I understand correctly, an efficiently strongly verifiable function belongs, in some sense, to a function class similar to the complexity class NP. Of course, there are fundamental differences, but the similarity is apparent. From this perspective, the claim made in Lemma 2 is quite natural, suggesting that a problem is not in P if it is not in NP.\n\n\nReference:\nYun, Chulhee, Suvrit Sra, and Ali Jadbabaie. \"Efficiently testing local optimality and escaping saddles for ReLU networks.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2019."

                "value": "## Motivation\n\nMy primary concern lies with the motivation behind studying the complexity of the \"verification\" of Goldstein stationary points. As noted by the authors, an efficient strong \"verifier\" (as defined in Definition 6) cannot be an efficient \"tester\" in the conventional sense, as demonstrated by Yun et al. (2019). One possible consideration is to establish lower bounds on finding stationary points by proving the hardness of weak verification, as claimed in this paper. However, this raises several technical concerns.\n\n## Major Technical Points\n\nOne such concern is the formal definition of an \"omnipotent prover,\" which I found rather confusing, especially in its usage in Definitions 6 and 7.\n\n- In the proof of Theorem 4, a \"computationally unbounded\" prover may be insufficient to provide the required vectors {y_i} without additional information about the underlying function f. In contrast, an \"omniscient\" prover is needed to expose such information. This prover should be able to communicate with the function f to extract the information of $\\partial_\\delta f$ and return the correct Caratheodory's decomposition {g_i}_i. This is not just a terminology issue but indeed a lack of rigor in the setup of the theoretical framework. This vagueness in definition might become fatal in the following comments.\n\n- The most questionable aspect, in my opinion, is the proof of Corollary 1. As previously discussed, the prover needs to communicate with the underlying function f to facilitate strong verification in Theorem 4. In the proof of Corollary 1, while I understand that $f_0$ and $f_1$ are consistent on the queried points {$x^{(i)}$}, I don't comprehend why an \"omniscient\" prover would provide exactly the same sequence {$x^{(i)}$} for both functions $f_0$ and $f_1$. As mentioned earlier, a legitimate prover should communicate with both $f_0$ and $f_1$ to provide the most useful information. This raises concerns about the correctness of Corollary 1, which is the main result addressing Q2.\n\n- A similar issue regarding correctness persists in the proof of Corollary 2, as the author states, \"the proof is analogous to that of Corollary 1.\" Corollary 2 is the main result addressing Q3.\n\n## Minor Technical Points\n\n- On page 6, concerning the algorithm, why does the function $f$ need to be differentiable at points {y_i}? Consider the following example: let $\\epsilon = 1/2$, $\\delta = 1$, and f(x) = max{-1, min{ x, 1 }}. Consider $x=0$. In this case, $y_1 = -1$ and $y_2 = 1$ is the only correct choice, but the function is nondifferentiable at both points.\n\n- A remedy could be replacing the gradients in the Algorithm with Clarke subdifferentials. But this brings a computational issue. How can you ensure the efficient solvability of the convex program in the algorithm? In the general case, even with convexity, this problem could be computationally intractable.\n\n- Another issue is that, in Fact 2, the result is stated for polytopes. But a subdifferential could be far from a polytope. Consider $\\partial (x \\mapsto ||x||)(0)$.\n\n## Other Comments\n\n- I do not understand why, in Definition 7, completeness and soundness are stated separately and the verifier needs to return a boolean $b \\in$ {0,1}. As well-noted by the authors, the \"if\" condition in the completeness part is always true, so the \"verifier\" will always return $b=1$, and the \"if\" condition in the soundness part is also always true.\n\n- In Corollary 2, the required width of the lattice is of the order $\\epsilon\\delta$, which is too large to have practical implications."

The basic setup is black-box access to a non-smooth, non-convex function $f$ via either a zeroth-order oracle (i.e. the ability to evaluate $f(x)$) or a first-order oracle (i.e. the ability to compute a generalized gradient $\\partial f(x)$). The main tractable solution concept in this setup is a Goldstein stationary point, which is a point $x$ such that there exists a convex combination $g$ of generalized gradients $\\partial f(y)$ for $y$ in a $\\delta$ neighborhood of $x$, with $\\lVert g \\rVert < \\epsilon$. Notably, from the definition it is not apriori obvious how to even verify whether a given point $x$ is a Goldstein stationary point, unlike in the smooth case where one gradient evaluation suffices. \n\nPrior work (Jordan et al. 2022) gives a randomized algorithm with dimension-independent runtime for approximating a Goldstein stationary point with access to a first-order oracle, and further shows that any deterministic algorithm cannot achieve any convergence without access to both a first and second-order oracle. The same prior work also gives a linear-in-the-dimension lower bound for deterministic algorithms with access to both a first and second order oracle.\nThe main result of this paper shows that any deterministic algorithm with access to only a zeroth order oracle requires a number of oracle queries that is exponential in the dimension. On the way to this result, the authors study the complexity of verifying that a given point is a Goldstein stationary point, and give an efficient deterministic first-order verification algorithm for this task, under the assumption of arbitrary accuracy of the first-order oracle. The main lower bound of the paper actually applies to the problem of deterministic zeroth-order verification of  Goldstein stationary points, which then straightforwardly implies the same lower bound for any algorithm that finds such a point."

While achieving an exponential lower bound is great, it only holds when one severely limits the class of allowable algorithms (only function evaluation queries, no randomness). In terms of previously studied problems, it would have been more interesting to determine whether the linear-in-dimension lower-bound is tight for deterministic algorithms with access to both first and zeroth order oracles. \n\nThe problem of verification of Goldstein points is new to this work and interesting, but the main positive result in this case is a straightforward observation from Caratheodory's theorem, and further utilizes first-order queries of arbitrary accuracy. At this point the most critical open question about verification of Goldstein points appears to be whether one can achieve deterministic verification with finite accuracy. This would demonstrate a nice separation between the problem of verification and finding Goldstein stationary points. However, the main result on query accuracy in the paper is for deterministic zeroth-order algorithms, which demonstrates a dependence on $\\delta$ in the accuracy required which is not present for smooth functions. This seems to me like a very minor technical difference, whereas settling the question of whether deterministic verification with finite-accuracy first-order queries is possible seems like it would make a qualitative difference in our understanding of this solution concept."

Can the authors explain more about the intuition behind the main idea of the construction in this theorem?"

While several recent works have studied this notion from various angles, this paper explores a fresh question: how can we *verify* Goldstein stationarity? The paper uses connections with Caratheodory's theorem to study this question."

In my view, this paper's key contribution --- and a big one at that --- is identifying this nice question."

                "value": "Thank you for the interesting and nicely written paper. I have the following main question. \n\n**Question 1a.** Why, in Theorem 4, is it valid to assume that we get a gradient at the query point instead of a subgradient? After all, the function $f$ is assumed to **not** be differentiable everywhere. \n\n**Question 1b.** Following Question 1a, if suppose we were to replace line 2 of the algorithm displayed on Page 6 with $g_i$ being some subgradient of $f$ at $y_i$, then would the algorithm's output of $b=0$ still be correct in all conditions? I fear that this may not be so because a $\\delta$-Goldstein subdifferential at $x$ is the convex hull of the union of the subdifferentials in a $\\delta$-neighbourhood of $x$, so just because $g$ isn't in the convex hull of the *current* subdifferentials doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't exist in any of the other possible subdifferentials; but then again, it looks like one would need to verify a large number of sets to check this, which seems too costly? I would of course be happy to see a proof showing otherwise! (Also, this question obviously depends on the validity of my Question 1a, so I'd also be happy if this question isn't even valid.)"
