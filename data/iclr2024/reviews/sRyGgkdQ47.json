To address this issue, a two-stage training strategy is proposed, which involves fixing BN statistics after an initial normal training phase. This approach is shown to yield consistent improvements over Group Normalization (GN) across various FL scenarios."

This work contains comprehensive theoretical analysis of issue of BN and emphasizes that there exists deviation of gradient. However, authors do not include theoretical comparison with this work. Authors also mention that biased gradient can cause the failure of performance in FL, which is similar to the above work. Theoretical analysis is required to validate the conclusion.\n2. Table 2 is an extreme case where single step of mini-batch SGD is performed. It is not surprising that such kind of high variance update can degrade the performance in distributed setting. More general setting should be considered to illustrate the issue of BN.\n3. It is strongly suggested that specific algorithm is written in this paper. It is difficult to refer to equations to see the details.\n4. The fix method is not novel.
