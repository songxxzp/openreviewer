The conclusion of the paper, says spectral shift, is drawn from observations of several specific types of PDEs, can be empiricism, and may not be generalizable enough for other PDEs. In addition, justifying whether a PDE will suffer from an extrapolation failure using WWF can be difficult in practice. To examine whether the WWF is blockwise or not, it requires true $f_s$ for $s\\in I$ and $f_t$ for $t\\in E$, while $f_s$ and $f_t$ are not available for most practical cases. \n\n2. Leveraging the concept of spectral bias for extrapolation as a hypothesis is problematic. The spectral bias states that NN tends to learn low-frequency components more easily and faster than high-dimensional components during training [1]. While extrapolation is a validation/testing process. Thus, one should not explain a phenomenon in testing with a theory for training, or use it as a hypothesis (despite that the paper beats the hypothesis to the end). The hypothesis reference paper [2] does not make any statement on extrapolation with spectral bias either, they only assert PINNs fail to train when the training time window becomes large, possibly due to spectral bias.\n\n3. The presentation of the paper can be improved, say most figures can be denser to save space, and most tables can have nicer borders, etc.\n\n[1].

If the characteristics of the PDE solutions change drastically after some time scale i.e. have a large spectral shift.\n\nI am missing an analysis where the a particular differential equation have short time behaviour which is spectrally \"stable\" and long term behaviour, where the spectral shift emerges.  Hence, the difference in the PDE behaviour may also come from how long a certain trajectory is followed, not intrinsically from what kind of equation it is. Then, a user of the method may feel safe to extrapolate a given PDF that has seemed to be \"safe\" but enter in the dangerous domain without warning.\n\nIt seems that safe way would be to use an alternative method to check the accuracy of the solution always, which makes the extrapolation capability less useful."
