                "value": "In this work, the author introduces the use of a parameter-efficient cross-task prompt for pre-trained models to tackle the challenges of class incremental learning in a rehearsal-free and memory-constrained manner. Specifically, unlike memory-based incremental learning methods, this approach obviates the need to retrain old samples. In comparison to the previous \"Prompt-fixed\" and \"Prompt-extending\" methods, the author proposes a more parameter-efficient manner of extracting relevant prompts."

                "value": "However, I have several concerns:\n\n1. Data Leakage from Pre-trained Model: The model has been pre-trained on ImageNet21k, and subsequently, the author employs a subset of this, ImageNet, for the incremental learning task. This presents a potential data leakage concern, as the pre-trained model has already been exposed to the entirety of ImageNet during its initial training. This practice may inadvertently violate the foundational principles of class incremental learning.\n\n2. Not being directly immersed in prompt learning, I'm concerned that the prompts might inadvertently leak information or task-id specifics to the broader model, especially when compared with prior class incremental learning methodologies, which only obtains the task id based on model itself, no prompts are used.\n\n3. Reproducibility of experiments is crucial. The primary results in Table 1 seem to have been conducted only once, without any mention of variance or average performance.\n\n4. While the number of prompts is detailed in the table, there's a noticeable lack of information regarding model size, computational complexity, and the execution time spent on distinct model components.\n\n5. The paper neglects the discussion of certain challenging tasks. Managing tasks in larger scales, such as when the number of tasks is 50 or 100, can be formidable. I'm curious about the performance of this method under such rigorous testing scenarios.\n\n6. A missing baseline: Given that the pre-trained model might already contain a wealth of information or representations, including those of the dataset under testing, there's a potential risk of the model being over-fitted to the dataset in question. I strongly recommend that the author includes performance metrics without the prompt, thereby delineating the actual gains derived from this approach."

Also, I'm wondering the results on comparison of PECTP and the other baselines with same prompt number (Either You can increase the prompt number in PECTP or you can decrease the prompt number in other baselines is fine).\n\n**2 (Necessity of Inner Prompt Granularity).** According to Table 3, utilizing both IPG and OPG has the good synergy to enhance the performance. To the best of my understanding, the roles of IPG and OPG are to prevent forgetting knowledge from the previous task and pretrained model, respectively. To validate the hypothesis that I mentioned, the additional ablation study is needed (i.e, we can split the test set for each task). For example, in table 3, baseline+IPG do not forget in the previous task compared to baseline+OPG or baseline, and baseline+OPG has the consistent results for all the tasks.\n\n**3 (Stress Test).** This work is noteworthy when the number of tasks is large (e.g, n_task=1000) due to scaling issue. As such, reporting the results in large number of tasks setup would be helpful to validate the effectiveness of their method."

How is it different from usual regularization-based CL methods, besides the fact that you are doing on prompt parameters instead of all model parameters? \n3. Wouldn't limiting the update also limits the ability of learning new tasks?\n4. Why using a fixed set of prompts is even better than extending the set of prompts? For example, if the domain gaps are large between different tasks, the fixed set of prompts might not be able to represent them well without conflicts.\n- To me it seems the \"feature fusion\" module is the most interesting part that fixed prompts method work well.
