In particular, it considers the threat model in which adversaries can either use a model poisoning attack that aims to maximize average loss, or use a backdoor attack that aims to cause misclassification of poisoned test data while preserving decent performance on clean test data. The idea of the proposed algorithm is to converge towards an equilibrium where the central server has previously learned to defend itself against the mentioned attacks, and then learns in the context of the federated learning setting. The authors propose both a theoretical analysis of the number of gradient iterations and an experimental evaluation of the proposed solution."

More precisely, if I had to simplify the current formulation of the definition, one would have:\n\"Definition 2.1 :$\\theta$ and $\\phi$ constitute an equilibrium if they satisfy : $\\max_{\\theta} f(\\theta)$\"\nFor me there is definitely a problem in the formulation.\n\n- Figure 2 shows that the pre-training (that corresponds to Algorithm 1) output is the policy $\\pi_\\theta$ and the gradient adaptation $\\Psi$, whereas in Algorithm 1, the output is $\\theta$. This is a bit confusing. \n\n- As presented in the paper, the objective of federated learning is to minimize the loss on all clients. I think it would be better to say (or to add) that the objective of federated learning under attack is to minimize the loss on the set of honest clients and not on all the clients, since some of them are malicious.\n\n- In Definition 3.1, the intersection $\\Uptheta \\cap B(\\theta^\\star)$ in the first 'max' is exactly equal to $B(\\theta^\\star)$. Can you explain this choice? Same problem for the second 'max', and above all there is an error in the definition of $B(\\phi^\\star)$ which depends on theta, whereas the constraint is on $\\phi$... \n\n- The 'Meta_Update' function in Algorithm 1 is not explained anywhere.... Or maybe I just didn't find it.\n\n- Most of the graphs in the experiments section are not visible at all... the font size is too small.\n\nI found the paper very difficult to follow because of the points mentioned above.\n\nOn the content :\n\n- The state-of-the-art in defending against model poisoning (a.k.a Byzantine attacks) is to use the NNM [1] pre-aggregation rule before using any aggregation rule such as Krum or Trimmed-Mean etc... Why didn't the authors use this technique to compare with the proposed method?\n\n- Most of the time, the FL setting appears either when data needs to be kept on the client side, or when computing power needs to be divided. In both cases, it is assumed that the server will not learn on its own because it is not possible or practical to do so. Is there any practical reason why it is acceptable to consider that the central server is able to pre-train here? How does the server generate data? Overall, if the server is allowed to pre-train, would it not allow to train completely in a centralized way and avoid potential malicious client?\n\n[1] Youssef Allouah, Sadegh Farhadkhani, Rachid Guerraoui, Nirupam Gupta, Rafa\u00ebl Pinot, and John Stephan.

The pre-training proceeds by iteratively considering a batch of sampled attack type and subsequently unrolling a simulated training scenario using the current policy of both the defender and the attack type. An inner loop ensures that the attack policy is solved approximately optimally (at the expense of unrolling multiple times). A meta learning aggregation rule, such as Reptile, is used to aggregate the updates across the batch of sampled attack type. This allows adjusting to a particular (fixed and possibly unknown) attack type at training time more effectively. Convergence is shown under strict competition and PL conditions and the algorithm is demonstrated on MNIST and CIFAR10."

One major concern is that this is a very narrow scenario, which is subsequently solved by a (computationally expensive) heavy machinery. I would expect a simple baseline to do well. Why not in Table 1 compare against the same defences as used in the policy based method (e.g. FoolsGold)? How about comparing against a fixed policy (with reasonable defaults)?\n\nOne major issue is that the final algorithms is never fully specified since many parts remains undefined (even after looking through the appendix):\n\n- What is an attacker type? Is it a fine set? Last paragraph of page 3 does not seem to define it precisely.\n- What is the policy for a given attack type? In theory part is it a mapping from parameter space to parameter space? In practice is it the hyperparameters of a given attack type?\n- Right before section 4.2: \n    - You seem to optimize over $\\mathbb R^3$ (with some additional constraints) for untargeted defences policy and similarly for backdoor defence. Should we understand that $\\theta$ in Algorithm 1 lives in the _product_ space of the two?\n    - Do you project to keep e.g. $b$ in $a_1^t:=(a,b,c)$ within the trimming threshold?\n - The online adaptation only seems to be described loosely in the paragraph right before section 3. Do you need to store a trajectory of model weights? What is the memory requirement?\n\n I suggest specifying the algorithm (as used in both theory and in experiments) in full detail.\n \nTheory:\n\n- The convergence results do not seem surprising or informative. All difficulty seems to be assumed away with PL conditions, strict-competitiveness, increasing batchsize and approximating a max-oracle. You also seem to be ignoring the size of the (sampled) attack type space. Is the batch size of the attack types taken \"large enough\"? (intuitively it should depend on $\\varepsilon$)\n- If the attack types space have no structure (it is a set) how can you give a meaningful OOD generalization bound? In the appendix it seems that you almost have to assume that their policies are not too different. Can you elaborate on what this proposition buys you?\n- If the model is overparameterized the attacker can construct a backdoor attack without harming the defenders reward. How does solving (2) prevent a backdoor attack?\n\nIt seems that the methods intentionally _violates client privacy_ to construct the necessary simulation dataset. Bottom page 7 states \"We use inference attack (i.e., Inverting gradient (Geiping et al., 2020)) in (Li et al., 2022a) for only a few FL epochs (20 in our setting) to learn data from clients\". This does not seem viable. Do you have ablation over how much the simulated data quality degrades the performance?"

Then when we apply this in real FL environment, we rely on the defender's policy network to alter the updated global model at each iteration, to defende against potential attackers. And importantly, the learned defender's policy will only work for the particular neural network used for minimizing FL loss during pre-training, i.e., if we change the dataset (e.g., change in distribution of x, or conditional distribution of y|x), choose a different loss function, or change the structure of the neural network, the defender policy no longer works. Is this correct?\n\nWhat I am a little bit confused about is, what this framework seems to be saying is that, we have already have enough data to train a neural network $w$ during pre-training to solve some FL task. Now what I am worried about is that, if I train this neural network again in real FL environment (ideally, using exactly the same training data as the one used during pre-training), there might be some attackers that manipulate my global model updates. Therefore, to defend against them, I will create a simulation environment that contains different type of attackers, and I train my neural network $w$ to solve the FL task, with the help of a defender policy $\\theta$ that tries to \"correct\" the manipulated global model. Now with the trained defender policy $\\theta$ (with some online adaptation), I can properly train my network $w$ in real FL environment in the face of potential attackers.\n\nIf this is true, then it seems FL is not really necessary, since we are already capable of training a good $w$ locally?

But the currently definition says we should care about the cumulative loss during the whole FL procedure, which does not seem to be very reasonable? Perhaps changing the reward definition in Section 2.2 to \"reduction of loss compared with last iteration\", instead of loss at current iteration would be better?\n\n3.
