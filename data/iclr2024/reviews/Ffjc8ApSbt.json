                "value": "The paper proposes a unified kernel-based method to balance functions on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to address the bias in collaborative filtering due to the observational nature of the collected data. Although balancing (i.e., re-weighting the sample loss) is an important technique to address such selection bias, this paper characterizes the effect of balancing low-dimensional functions on the bias of inverse propensity score (IPS) and doubly robust (DR) methods. A novel adaptive causal balancing method that alternates between unbiased evaluation and model training is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted on real-world recommendation data sets to demonstrate the proposed method could effectively improve prediction performance compared with the existing benchmarks."

To achieve this, the authors suggest utilizing kernel functions as balancing functions and put forth three approaches for selecting these kernels.

                "value": "I think the idea in this paper is interesting and has some value. However, I have some significant concerns that prevent me from recommending this manuscript for acceptance.\n\n **1. Motivation**\n\n- W1: This paper lacks a sufficient motivation for the importance of carefully selecting the function class for balancing. The authors do discuss the computational cost associated with choosing numerous balancing functions in Section 3.2. However, the original paper [1] suggests that even selecting a single function for balancing can yield performance improvements. It is essential to elucidate why the choice of multiple balancing functions is necessary and why the specific type of function is critical. In my view, the motivation may be derived from Corollary 1 to some extent, which asserts that certain types of balancing functions introduce bias (correct me if I am wrong). Nonetheless, it would be valuable to provide a more insightful explanation in the introduction section. I would like to see an illustrative example, which could enhance comprehension of the motivation.\n\n**2. Clarity**\n\nThis paper contains several areas of ambiguity and insufficient support for its claims, which hinder the comprehension of its ideas. Some key issues include:\n\n- W2: The optimization problems in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 are perplexing. The rationale behind minimizing the sum of $g(\\cdot) \\log g(\\cdot)$ as opposed to a standard cross-entropy loss is unclear and confusing. The purpose of constraining the sum of $o_{u,i}g(\\cdot)$ to be one and the meaning of the third constraint require more detailed explanation and motivation. The authors should clarify the significance and reasoning behind each statement in the proposed optimization problem.\n\n- W3: Several theorems and corollaries, such as Theorem 1, Corollary 1, and Lemma 2, lack supporting proofs. In particular, the proof of Corollary 1, which appears directly relevant to the paper's motivation, is crucial.\n\n- W4: The paper suggests that \"balancing propensity can reduce the generalization bound\", but this claim is not clearly evident from Theorem 2, which seems to provide a bound without a comparative analysis.\n\n- W5: The fourth paragraph in Section 1 references \"the first question\" and \"the second question\", but it is unclear where these questions are presented in the paper.\n\n- W6: The paper does not elaborate on how the parameters within the kernel functions are learned. For instance, Gaussian kernel functions are known to have a parameter, $\\sigma$. The paper should explain the process for selecting suitable parameter values.\n\n- W7: Given that kernel functions are not frequently used for debiasing Recommender Systems, it is recommended that the authors provide more specific definitions and formulations regarding the kernel functions in Section 4.3 to enhance clarity.\n\n- W8: There are some typos in this paper. \n  - Section 1: \"it is the first paper provides ...\", \"Ours theoretical analysis shows...\". \n  - Section 4.4: \"which Random chooses...\".\n\n**3. Experiments**\n\n- W9: The paper does not specify which kernel function was chosen, whether Gaussian or exponential.\n\n- W10: I found that the performance on \"Coat\" you reported in Table 1 is significantly lower than that on [1]. It would be helpful to understand whether this variance is attributed to different experimental settings or other factors.\n\n- W11: The abbreviation \"CB\" for causal balancing is indeed similar to \"Covariate Balancing\" and may cause confusion. A more distinct abbreviation should be considered to prevent any potential misunderstandings. \n\nOverall, the motivation and clarity are my main concerns. I will consider changing my score if I receive a high-quality (concise and clear) rebuttal.\n\n[1] Haoxuan Li, Yanghao Xiao, Chunyuan Zheng, Peng Wu, and Peng Cui. Propensity matters: Measuring and enhancing balancing for recommendation. 2023d.\n\n\n---\n\n*After the rebuttal: the authors address the most of my concerns. Therefore, I am glad to raise my score from 3 to 6.*"
