Specifically, T-GAE devises a GNN encoder to match nodes from different graphs. Through permutation and perturbation, different versions of graphs are generated to be augmented datasets. These datasets enable T-GAE to have generalization and be extended to other graphs. The transferability helps T-GAE perform network alignment on other graphs without retraining."

                "value": "1] It seems to me that several of the claims you make in the paper are stated too generally to be true and cannot be substantiated by evidence, e.g., \"enable a generalized framework that can be applied to out-of-distribution graphs that have not been observed during training\" (there is no guarantee that you can perform well on out-of-distribution graphs, in fact we already observe strong performance drops at 5% perturbation rates; this should be clarified) and \"the learned mapping can be applied to larger, big-data graphs with high accuracy and efficiency\", as well as \"to tackle network alignment at a very large scale\" (the largest network you consider has 18 thousand nodes and 81 thousand edges, in the context of the ogb benchmarks [1] for example it is difficult to call your considered data sets \"very large\" or even \"big-data\"). I therefore want to ask you to please weaken these statements to be more realistic or to provide further evidence to substantiate these claims in the generality in which they are stated. \n\n2] In Section 4.3 in your data augmentation method you propose to permute the node labels of the perturbed graphs. GNNs should either be permutation equivariant or invariant to node permutation, in either case the permutation of node labels in your perturbed graphs should be inconsequential. Could you therefore please motivate the node permutation in your data augmentation method?\n\n3] Your experimental evaluation could be further improved. \n\n3.1] Using a standard graph autoencoder and graph variational autoencoder as a baseline seems intuitive to me and would provide a nice ablation study to give insight on which parts of your architecture are major contributors to your observed performance increases. \n\n3.2] While you state DeepWalk to be one of your baseline models, it is absent in Table 3 and only used for subgraph matching in Figure 3. Could you please explain why you choose not to use it for graph matching? \n\n3.3] While this is certainly not a requirement, it might be worthwhile to include more advanced unsupervised embedding methods such as LINE [2] in your baselines to strengthen the evidence in favour of your model. \n\n3.4] The larger datasets you transfer to are known to be structurally similar to the smaller datasets you trained on, e.g., they are also homophilic. It might be more meaningful to consider to what degree your pre-trained models transfer to datasets with drastically different characteristica, such as for example heterophilic datasets. Or whether your method is still viable at even larger scale than 18 thousand nodes. \n\n\n4] Minor comments:\n\n4.1] The font in Figure 1 is too small to be comfortably read on a print-out.\n\n4.2] It is unclear to me what you mean by a GNNs output being unique. It would be good if you could clarify your use of the word unique in the paper. GNNs can produce equal representations of different graphs (see for example [3]) and consequently, one could reasonably claim GNN embeddings to not be unique in the sense that GNN embeddings do not uniquely identify graphs they correspond to.\n\n4.3] There is minor errors in the bold font setting in Tables 3 and 4, e.g., \"90.0\\pm0.4\" in row 1 column 3 of Table 3 and \"90.1\\pm0.4\" in row 1 column 3 Table 4. \n\n4.4] I could not see where you describe or reference the GNN_c, which seems to be one of the backbones of your T-GAE. Could you please add further detail on this model or point me to the part of your paper where this is described?\n\n\n[1] Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M. and Leskovec, J., Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs.

Although the authors include 8 graph datasets in the experiments, there is only one setting of experiments; they used specific 4 datasets in the training, and evaluated on all the datasets. Why do the authors pick this setting? Can they perform experiments with more diversity?\n4. (Related to Weakness 2) In Section 5.2.2, the authors create the datasets using the same perturbation approach used for their proposed method. The performance improvement is not surprising because of that reason. It might be better to find a real perturbation scenario and see if their proposed way of perturbation can deal with realistic problems.\n5.
