Unlike previous works that rely on entropy of model outputs, the authors propose to leverage reward from CLIP model as feedback to adapt models. The proposed method based on reinforcement learning with CLIP feedback is evaluated on three tasks, including zero-shot image classification, zero-shot text-image retrieval, zero-shot and cross-domain image captioning, showing improved performances."

How to improve their zero-shot generalization ability, especially in the challenging task of test-time adaptation, is a worthwhile research problem.\n+ The authors propose to leverage CLIP feedback for adapting models. This seems to be novel and is interesting to me. As many vision-language learning methods are built upon CLIP, the intergration of CLIP reward is natural.\n+ The proposed RLCF method universally applies to different tasks, like zero-shot classification, text-image retrieval, image captioning. Hence, the idea may inspire research in many other VL tasks.\n+ The method is simple yet effective. The experiments and analyses are extensive in the paper. For each task, RLCF is compared with a few  baseline methods, showing significant improvements.\n+ The paper is very easy to follow with a clear motivation and method descriptions. Visualizations (e.g. fig.1) also look nice."

For example, CLIP shows less satisfactory accuracies on fine-grained datasets like FGVC Aircraft, EuroSAT, CUB, etc. CLIPScore may be not informative in the fine-grained classification.\n- The authors use CLIP-ViT-L and a few other variants for calculating reward. The commonly used backbone in VL learning is CLIP-ViT-B. It is understandable that CLIP-ViT-L leads to better text-image alignment. But discussions on CLIPScore with CLIP-ViT-B would be helpful to understand how robust RLCF is to unreliable rewards."

In Eq.(5), any difference if not subtracting the expectation term?\n- The authors mention RLCF-S adopts weighted reward sum and RLCF-S-M adds a momentum buffer. Could the authors explain more about this? Also as mentioned in the weakness, more comments on using less reliable CLIP like CLIP-RN50, CLIP-B would be appreciated."

The two tweaks are sampling strategies and adding a baseline to the reward function. It weakens the novelty of the proposed method. Besides, the comparison between the proposed RLCH and [1] is missing.\n\n- The authors state that compared to pseudo-label and KD, the feedback mechanism combines the merits of both the student and teacher. However, the authors only investigate the original version of KD proposed in 2015. Moreover, I recommend that the authors evaluate the ensemble of the student and teacher model, which can directly combine their merits.\n\n- For the experiments on image captioning, I suggest that the authors add the results of  CLIPCap and CapDec with the CLIP-ViT-L/14 architecture (the teacher model) for a more comprehensive comparison.\n\n- Could the authors provide more implementation details of TPT+KD?\n\n- Typo: kD->KD on page 8\n\n\n[1] Cho, Jaemin, et al.
