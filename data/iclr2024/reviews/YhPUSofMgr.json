The authors then conduct experiments on a variety of locomotion experiments, and the results show that the proposed method can learn to perform following the text while performing the motion as autonomous agents.\n\n---\n\nPost rebuttal: the authors provided extensively more experiments, which not look very good but it's reasonable. As a result, I upgrade my score from five to six."

The game environments are not natural images but the diffusion models are trained on natural images. How will this work in a game environment? I doubt the effectiveness of diffusion models in such a scenario. Can the authors show some generated images in this locomotion environment? Otherwise, I doubt the effectiveness of using diffusion models here.\n\n2. If the video is not used, why doesn't the model get stuck into some best-matching frames? Since policy learning often involves some non-trivial procedures, it is not convincing if the authors only use text-to-image techniques but not video encoding methods. The matching should be conducted in the temporal space.\n\n3. I see that the provided video demos do not have a very complex procedure. Most videos are nearly static and do not move much. This problem may be due to the use of images in the reward calculation.\n\n# Comparisons and experiments.\n\n1. Why don't the authors compare their methods in other language-guided tasks such as language-guided navigation?\n\n2. The results shown in Table 1-2 are not very surprising. The authors are recommended to try harder problems. Also, comparing it to pure RL methods is a must."

                "value": "The paper is overall well-written, clearly presented, and very easy to follow. The idea of using a diffusion model to provide a dense reward signal is interesting and novel (as far as I know). On the environments that are tested, the method is successful and performs better than CLIP, which is a natural baseline. The result of successfully performing locomotion tasks in zero-shot from text prompts is impressive."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the idea of the paper is sound and interesting, I think the experiments are insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of the method, particularly due to the lack of baselines.\n\n- The experiments are overall very thin. The tested tasks are very simple and not very numerous, which does not really convince me that TADPol is generally applicable or works consistently.\n- Baselines are lacking, with a CLIP-based reward being the only baseline. There are other methods use various pretrained models to provide a dense reward: e.g., LIV, which is mentioned in the related works section. Comparison to some other reward learning methods would be appropriate.\n- While the paper is overall fairly clear, I feel that the title is a bit of a misnomer and the narrative constructed at the beginning of the paper caused some confusion. The method does not involve a diffusion policy at all; it leverages a text-to-image diffusion model, but only to provide rewards in a policy-agnostic way. I also found all of the talk about the policy as an implicit video-generating model distracting, as well as the discussion of video-generating diffusion models in the related work. I don't think these are fundamentally related to TADPol, since the end goal of the method has nothing to do with generative modeling, but is instead just about achieving good performance in traditional RL tasks. I really think the authors should edit the paper to make sure it does not claim to perform any sort of video synthesis since this is a gross overstatement."
