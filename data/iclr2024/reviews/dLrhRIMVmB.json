This work avoids an unrealistic data input model by constructing an explicit (and shallow) quantum circuit for data-loading. The two major steps in the circuit construction are (1) representing the full boundary operator as a Fermionic boundary operator that allows efficient Pauli decompositions, and (2) projection onto problem-specific simplices using a quantum rejection sampling technique. Notably, the explicit circuit construction of the combinatorial Laplacian operator does not require accessing stored quantum data. \n\nTo estimate the Betti number (defined as the rank of the kernel space of the boundary operator), the authors adopt a stochastic rank estimation method. First, the rank estimation problem is recast into a trace estimation problem through a spectral mapping function $h(\\cdot)$, which can be constructed using a truncated Chebyshev series. Then, by employing a stochastic trace estimation method due to Hutchinson, the Betti number is estimated by summing over finitely many the Chebyshev moments. \n\nNISQ-TDA has been tested on both noisy numerical simulators and trapped-ion quantum devices (Quantiuum). Numerical results suggest good robustness against machine noise."

This time complexity looks exponentially better than the best-known classical result. However, this result is not directly comparable with the complexity of Quantum TDA ($O(n^5/(\\delta_k \\sqrt{\\zeta_k}))$) (of course, the QTDA requires stronger quantum computers). Is it possible that NISQ-TDA can outperform the fault-tolerant QTDA in a certain parameter regime?\n\n2. The circuit depth of NISQ-TDA heavily depends on the Chebyshev truncation number. What is the exact dependence of the Chebyshev truncation number in terms of the input data set (or the projection operator)? Does the resource analysis (Fig 1A) treat the Chebyshev truncation number as a parameter depending on the number of vertices, or it is fixed as a constant?\n\n3. In Fig 1B-D, how many shots were used on the hardware to estimate the probability? \n\n4. In Fig 2A, the error seems huge for intermediate-size problems even with moderate machine noise (e.g., (0.001, 0.01) for 1- and 2-qubit gate error).
