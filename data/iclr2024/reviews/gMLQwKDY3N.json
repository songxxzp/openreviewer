                "value": "With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), these models are capable of generating human-like text, posing various risks such as the proliferation of false information on the Internet and the infringement of copyrights on creative works. Therefore, texts generated by LLMs need to be detectable and taggable. Existing watermarking algorithms are mostly public, requiring the detector to use the secret key employed in the watermark generation process, which exposes the method to vulnerabilities as attackers can easily remove and forge the text watermarks. To address these shortcomings, the authors propose a novel private watermarking algorithm designed specifically for LLMs. The approach uses two separate neural networks for watermark generation and detection, eliminating the dependency on a single secret key across both stages. The security of this method is enhanced through computational asymmetry, making it significantly more challenging to reverse-engineer the watermark generation algorithm from the detector. To reduce the complexity of training, the authors also introduced a technique to share token embedding parameters between the detector and the generator. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating nearly equivalent performance to public watermark algorithms while proving its resilience against two mentioned attacks."

For example, on p1, the authors write the following. \n> However, current watermarking algorithms are all public, which means the detection of watermarks requires the key from the watermark generation process. \n\nBut then, the authors state that any watermarking method can be made private by limiting who has access to this detection key (also p1).\n\n> Although Kirchenbauer et al. (2023) have suggested that the watermark detection process could be placed\nbehind the web API to achieve the effect of private watermarking, this approach requires substantial\nserver resources and robust designs against hacking (even social engineering). \n\nHence, there is a trivial method to make watermarking algorithms private, meaning that not all watermarking methods are public. I am confused by the author's definition of a private and public watermark. I understand the general idea of separate keys for generating and verifying a watermark, but could the authors please elaborate on their definition of a private watermark? Why is their method not public (as the definition used by Kirchenbauer [A] suggests: A watermark is public if anyone can detect a watermark in text). \n\n**Imprecise Language**\n\n* What does \"cracking the watermarking rules\" mean? Are the authors referring to the integrity of their watermarks? \n* What does it mean to \"implement watermarking in a privacy-preserving manner\"? \n* What are \"definite labels\" (p9)? \n\n**Robustness**\n\nThe authors' focus appears to be on the effectiveness and privacy of their watermark, and they do not study its robustness. An attacker who can verify a watermark in any text sequence should be much more capable of removing the watermark. Why did the authors not evaluate robustness? What good is a watermark that is not robust? Even if the watermark is not robust, I would appreciate it if the authors included these experiments showing their watermark's limitations. \n\n\n**Minor Questions**\n\n* What does FFN stand for in EQ 2?\n\n* How many parameters does the LSTM have?\n\n* In EQ 3, is \"P\" supposed to be the probability? Earlier, it was defined to be the logit score.\n\n* In EQ 8, what is $f$? \n--------\n[A]\u00a0Kirchenbauer, J., Geiping, J., Wen, Y., Katz, J., Miers, I., & Goldstein, T. (2023).
