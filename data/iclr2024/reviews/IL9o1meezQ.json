When the authors say the random walks are sampled by the BERT-like model, it's not clear whether it's permutation-invariant or not since the BERT model doesn't come with the causal mask but with positional embedding.\n\n2. it's not clear how the V_start is reset using node degree information.\n\n3. In my understanding, the random walk sampling doesn't utilize any structural information of the (previous) generated graph. It must take the node feature information as input in order to work well. In this case, the proposed method can only generate graphs conditioning on node features. Since node features are not considered by NetGAN and EDGE, I suggest the author should highlight the difference.\n\n4. Based on my comment 3, the author should also add graphite as one of the baselines.\n\n5. I believe the Edge Overlap is the lower the better. If a model works well with high EO, it is simply because it memorizes the original graph structure. I don't think the comparison against the baseline is totally fair -- Arrow-diff has 50% EO while the others have ~1% EO\n\n6. Is the result reported in EDGE and NetGAN trained with node features? if so, can you provide details about how the model is modified to do so?\n\n7. Time complexity analysis is missing. It should be explicitly analyzed to demonstrate why the method is so efficient, this involves showing the detail of the used models (for random walk and GNN)."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) At inference time, the method relies on generating a sufficient number of paths with appropriate length. Assuming that the training graphs are densely connected (i.e. a large number of pairs of nodes are connected by an edge), the number of edges in the graph is quadratic in the number of nodes, and the number of paths increases significantly as their length increases. It is unclear how the proposed method is robust and representative of all the possible paths in the graphs. In particular, the method would miss a lot of edges if it does not sample enough random walks.\n\nSimilarly, during training, the method only considers local information in the graph (i.e. random edge sequences) and not its global structure. Therefore, for large dense graphs, the number of edges becomes quadratic in the number of nodes and it might be difficult to sample enough random walks to be representative of the connectivity in the graph. \n\n2) In terms of evaluation, the purpose of the task described in Section 5.2 (graph generation from a single-graph dataset) is not clear to me. The purpose of graph generation is usually to generate multiple diverse graphs that follow the same distribution as the graphs forming a dataset. If the training set contains a single graph, then it is not clear what the distribution of the training set should be other than a singleton. A naive baseline for the task would be an autoencoder whose decoder always returns the same graph as the training graph. It also seems that the proposed method corresponds to a (denoising) autoencoder that simply tries to reconstruct the edges of a single graph in the setup of Section 5.2. This would explain why the proposed method outperforms the baselines in this setup. \n\nThe evaluation with the reported baselines then seems unfair since many baselines are trained to promote novelty and non-uniqueness (i.e., generating graphs that are not in the training set, and diverse). \nThe scores reported in Table 2 seem to promote overfitting over a single sample/graph and does not really reflect the generative power of the different methods.\n\n3) The experiments in Section 5.3 and Table 3 are not convincing either. Digress and EDGE seem competitive with respect to all the evaluation metrics except training time (which may be reduced with more computing power). In generative models, an interesting metric is the inference time to generate new samples. The novelty and uniqueness score are not reported either.\n\n4) The number of nodes of the generated graph is the same as the number of nodes of the training graph."

Assuming that the number of steps L and the number of initial sampled random walks M are both large, do different sets of random walks tend to return the same value of p(n) in Step 11 of Algorithm 2?\n\n3) The main purpose of using multiple GNN steps at inference time is to evaluate the degrees of nodes. Do you have ablation studies to see the impact of M and L for training? If M becomes large, then the training takes longer but does it improve generation scores? Same question for the length of the paths.\n\n4) How does the method deal with permutation invariance? Assuming that the dataset contains multiple graphs that are all isomorphic (e.g. the graph with the edges (1, 2) and (2, 3) is isomorphic with the graph containing (3, 1) and (1, 2), or (1, 3) and (3,2)), will the values of p(n) converge to some canonical representation or will p(n) = 1/3 for all n in this case?\n\n5) Same question for when the graph contains different nonisomorphic graphs, how does the method deal with permutation of nodes? How does the GNN differentiate the node IDs between different graphs?\n\n\nMinor detail. The paper should mention that m in step 3 of Algorithm 1 is a Boolean mask."
