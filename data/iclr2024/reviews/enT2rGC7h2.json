Generally speaking, as long as assumption 2.5 is made, the consistency of the distributed learning algorithm can be guaranteed, so the GD-SGD algorithm designed in this paper is not novel.\n\n2. Technically, the main proof techniques used in the paper can be found in [Li et al. (2022)] and [Hu et al. (2022)], except for the expansion of the communication patterns. Therefore, combined with the first weakness, the technical contribution of the paper is insufficient.\n\n3. The analysis and comparison of different sampling strategies in Cor. 3.4 are trivial. The authors only give a qualitative comparison of different sampling strategies based on existing work [Hu et al. (2022)]. In fact, this simple relationship can be easily generalized in existing works with both asymptotical and non- asymptotical results. From this point of view, the contribution of this article seems to be over-claimed.\n\n4.

The paper's main contribution is identifying that while non-asymptotic analyses of GD-SGD using Markovian sampling rely on the mixing time of the worst agent, the asymptotic analysis can benefit from every agent (not just the slowest one), improving their sampling strategies (c.f., Corollary 3.4). Simulations are provided to judge how quickly optimization enters the asymptotic phase and whether client sampling strategies affect the convergence rate."
