                "value": "This paper proposes Adversarial Feature Map Pruning for Backdoor (FMP), a new method for backdoor mitigation in neural networks. FMR does not require access to the trigger or poisoned data. Based on a clean data sample, the method reverse-engineers poison triggers from each feature map in the model (at multiple layers) based on back-propagation. The weights determined to be connected to the triggers are reinitialized and fine-tuned on clean data. Experiments are performed on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and GTSRB against a wide range of attacks and defenses."

                "value": "# Novelty and prior work\n\n- The novelty of the paper seems limited. The ideas of using adversarial examples to reverse engineer triggers (e.g., [ANP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14430.pdf), [AEVA](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OM_lYiHXiCL)) or pruning and retraining trigger weights ([RNP](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/li23v.html)) are not themselves novel. The paper does not cite most of these very close prior results and does not provide a conceptual comparison to them.\n- The prior art section mainly addresses defenses from different categories than the present one, which are then easy to dismiss. Outside the specific ideas used in FMT, there are many methods that address the same setup as the current paper and operate without knowledge of the trigger (e.g., [DeepInspect](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/647), [TABOR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01763.pdf), [ABS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3363216), [[Fu et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02526.pdf)]). These could be included in the experimental comparison.\n\n# Performance\n\n- Tab. 1 shows that the proposed method is only the best on average, but not doing so well on individual benchmarks (i.e., for each attack and dataset). The commentary section also fail to quantify how many benchmarks are actually won by the proposed method.\n\n# Clarity\n\n- Certain points in the paper are not clear, see also the questions below. Moreover, the components of the method are rather explained in an algorithm than in the text.\n- Assumptions should be clear earlier in the paper, e.g. the fact that a clean input sample is required.\n- The typography of the paper could be improved, please see some suggestions below. The paper could also use additional proofreading.\n- Tab. 1 is very dense and lacking highlights of the best values for each attack. As such, it is currently difficult to interpret.\n\n# Minor remarks\n\n- It is unclear why the feature maps are summed in the Notations paragraph (Sec. 3).\n- Some numerical results are typeset with spaces before the decimals (e.g., 2. 86%). These spaces should be removed\n- Consider using `\\citep` when the cited references are not part of the sentence (see [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Natbib_citation_styles))."

                "value": "1. What is the distinction the paper makes between a neural network layer output and a feature map?\n2. What does it mean in Alg. 1 that `Correct_list` is sorted in ascending order? According to which criterion?\n3. Are all the weights of the model refined during the fine tuning step or just those detected as being part of backdoors (i.e., the weights that are reset to zero)?\n4. Why is the backdoor feature initialization done by setting weights to zero, instead of using the same initialization strategy as when training the model for the first time (i.e., various random sampling strategies)? Has this alternative been considered?\n5. What is the impact of varying method parameters $\\epsilon$ and $p$ under other attacks than BadNets?"

The proposed algorithm was evaluated on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and GTSRB."
