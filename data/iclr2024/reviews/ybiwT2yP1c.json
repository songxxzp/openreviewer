I'm not sure to get this point. If the label of a query is known, then what is the point of retrieving samples from a dataset? We already know the answer.\n- Regardless, it would be nice to report results where none of the class embeddings from training time is used when evaluating the models. Because, one of the generalization aspects posed by the datasets is domain-shift, and it is not clear how to measure domain-shift when query embeddings come from training dataset (rather then being embedded at test time using downstream dataset images).\n\n## Comments on datasets\n- I wonder if there is a universal class taxonomy which encapsulates all the classes in all the datasets. For instance, in standard vision datasets (like ImageNet, MS-COCO), classes come from different ontologies/granularities and matching those classes is far from being trivial. To measure \"label shift\", it is essential to know which classes have been seen during training vs at test time (i.e. seen and unseen classes).\n- Also, when measuring label shift, what is the semantic relation (due to their granularity) between seen and unseen bird classes? \n- Is it possible to evaluate domain-shift while fixing label-shift? For instance, seen and unseen classes being equal, whereas recordings being focal vs passive. \n\n## Comments on the paper overall\n- Given that this is a benchmark paper, and that not everybody is super familiar with the domain (bioacoustics), I would expect a more direct and clear explanation of the task being solved, the types of input given to the network, etc. In that sense the paper is not easy to understand."
