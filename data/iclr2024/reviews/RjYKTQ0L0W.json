The method consists of three stages: content preparation, generation, and filtering. The authors showcase the effectiveness of their methodology by generating large-scale data for synthetic long-form question answering and summarization tasks. They compare models trained on their synthetic data with models trained on human-generated data and show that their models perform equally or better in terms of quality and faithfulness."

However, if we look at it purely from the perspective of \"Content-grounding generation,\" most traditional NLP tasks can be transformed into the paradigm: Instruction+Input -> Output, which matches with the definition of Content-grounding generation. However,  the paper only validates this on two tasks. Furthermore, in subsequent experiments, the paper only constructs data based on specific datasets, raising doubts about the generality of the proposed method. Therefore, I tend to believe that the paper exaggerates its contributions.\n2. The data construction methods mentioned in the paper rely on the format and source (Wiki) of previous datasets, making it challenging to assess their practicality in an open-world context."

It is necessary to perform a Multi-Dimensional Quality assessment on both the original and synthetic datasets to evaluate genuine quality enhancements. The paper lacks specifics on annotation details, including inter-annotator agreements.\n2. What if using llama 70b chat synthetic data to train a llama 70b model?  If we're talking about cost and time efficiency, then using synthetic data from LLMs to train smaller models might not be the most economical approach, if LLM itself can work well. The paper argues about the method being more cost-effective than traditional crowd-sourced dataset curation, which might exceed $1M. Yet, directly sourcing text from the web can be free, and existing filtering methods can be used to ensure data quality.\n3. The paper is more like an empirical exploration into using LLMs for synthetic data generation, which is not inspiring for other works."
