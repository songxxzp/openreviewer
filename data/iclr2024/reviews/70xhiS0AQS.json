In addition, for the benchmark to be faithful (which is very important given that benchmark is what people would use to assess model in a relatively long period), the query and answer should be matched, I doubt whether the rule-based and LLM-based check could always ensure the correctness of the generated instruction. I do think human verification on all the generated instruction can make the benchmark more faithful.\n\n**I took a close look at the huggingface dataset produced in this paper, a large portion of them are incorrect. For example, one of the data (id: 10949228), the user query  is \"I have an image 'example.jpg' containing some information. I want to convert the image content into text and then answer the question: 'What is the main topic of the image?\", the tool graph is Image-to-text -> VQA. However, once you do image-to-text (assuming captioning), why VQA? it makes no sense. it can just be a textual QA, right? There are many similar cases in the dataset.**\n\n 2. I don't quite understand the goal of evaluating task decomposition as textual descriptions. I do think evaluating task decomposition is important, but as long as it can build the correct tool graph and predict the correct parameter, it is good enough. So I don't think evaluating textual description is necessary, and given how diverse the textual description could be, the current automatic evaluation metric could be misleading."

Does the sampling procedure take \"task naturalness\" into account? Also, I'd suggest to include some actual examples in the paper.\n- While back-instructing to generate user requests is an intuitive approach. This procedure relies on GPT-4 and there is no guarantee that the generated data is correct (e.g., many of the examples are filtered out by simply using rule-based critics as mentioned). Even if more advanced LLM-based critic is used, there may still be wrong examples. Since the dataset is intended for evaluation, the data quality is of most the utmost importance. Without further (potentially manual) verification, it is not very convincing on the reliability of the benchmark.\n- As discussed in related work, there are several parallel efforts in creating benchmarks for LLM tool usage, and perhaps the most related is ToolBench [1].

With the diverse sampled subgraphs, back-instruct method is used to inversely craft user instructions, task steps, and tool invocation graphs.\nFor task evaluation, different steps are evaluated.
