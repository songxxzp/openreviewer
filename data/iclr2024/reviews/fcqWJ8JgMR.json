The main challenges are (1) the absence of teacher domain's data, (2) how to selectively transfer teachers' knowledge due to the distribution shift, and (3) how to balance OOD KD and domain-specific information learning. To tackle these three challenges, the method consists of a data-free learning generator, anchor learning module, and mixup learning module. Experiments on three datasets verified the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The only distinction being that the target domain network is more lightweight compared to the pre-trained teacher network. As a result, the problem setup seems to simply be a specific instance of the broader source-free domain adaptation scenario. This raises concerns about the novelty of the problem statement.\n\n2. Given the dataset $D_{s}$, which consists of OOD student domain data with labels, I wonder about the performance of the student when trained solely on $D_{s}$  in a supervised manner. Did the authors conduct any initial tests to gauge baseline performance? Without such a baseline, I question how the authors determined the severity of the problem.\n\nMinor:\n\n1. In Equation 2, the left-hand side (LHS) includes $z_{0}$  in its argument, but $z_{0}$ is absent from the right-hand side (RHS). Clarification is needed regarding the functional operations. This inconsistency is observed in Equations 2 and 3 as well.\n\n2. For Equation 4, while the expectation is based on $z_{0}$, $z_{0}$ is not reflected in the RHS's loss combination. A similar issue is present in Equation 6.\n\n3. In Equation 4, the loss function $L_{generator}$ is introduced. However, it's unclear whether this loss is optimizing the generator weights, the latent space, or both. This lack of clarity persists in Equations 5, 6, and 10.\n\n[1] Kurmi, Vinod K., Venkatesh K.
