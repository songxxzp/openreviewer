The idea is simple, instead of providing a language description about spatial relation of objects, this paper proposes to use symbols to represent the object relationship. By doing this, this method improves the off-the-shelf LLMs capability to reason about the spatial relationship. Five tasks are evaluated. The first task is called natural language spatial planning, in which the LLM is asked to move the object so that this location of objects will be in the desirable location. The second task is brick world, which is similar to the first task. And the third task is NLVR-based manipulation, in which the agent again needs to rearrange the object based on the textual instruction. And the fourth task is natura language navigation, in which the agent needs to navigate to different landmarks given the instructions. Finally, the spatial QA is a traditional benchmark for testing reasoning capability of LLMs. Table 1 and Table 2 show that CoS significantly improves the performance over CoT. And from Figure 3, the performance does not affect by the symbols that are used, which leads to that this method is robust to the symbols chosen. Overall, the paper demonstrates a nice result to verify the idea."

While this is technically correct given the results, the reported improvement is a little misleading because it's comparing zs-CoT vs. CoS and also such a dramatic gain isn't seen in most cases, especially when comparing the performance of CoS to CoT. In more realistic datasets like SPARTUN, the improvement is marginal. This suggests that the impressive gains are more about the simplicity of the Brick World dataset than any substantial leap in CoS performance. Thus, I believe the claim should be more moderate.\n- Apart from the previously mentioned issues, I find the contribution is limited for the following reason: the paper does demonstrate how you can condense the chain of thought (CoT) into a series of symbols, and that this is enough for tasks involving spatial relationships. However, this method of prompting might only be effective for spatial relationship tasks. Also, when you look at the final experiment (Table 5), it suggests that this method might not work as well in real-life situations. It seems that the success of this method, referred to as CoS, might be limited to simpler, more straightforward spatial tasks."
