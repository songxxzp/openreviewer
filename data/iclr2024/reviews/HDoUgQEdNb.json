It studies a valuable research problem - evaluating the reasoning chain of models in an automatic manner without relying on human-crafted references. The need for scalable, efficient, and reference-free reasoning evaluation metrics in the context of large language models is evident, and the paper is dedicated to addressing this gap.\n\n2. The paper proposes a simple approach SOCREVAL, which leverages the Socratic method-enhanced GPT-4 to provide reference-free reasoning evaluations. By employing strategies like Definition, Maieutics, and Dialectic from the Socratic method, this approach refines the prompting mechanism of LLMs, offering an effective way to evaluate reasoning chains without necessitating human-annotated references.\n\n3. The paper shows the effectiveness of SOCREVAL through empirical tests on four human-annotated datasets. These experiments revealed that GPT-4, when integrated with SOCREVAL, outperforms existing reference-free and reference-based reasoning evaluation metrics. Also, the authors provide evidence that SOCREVAL improves the evaluation ability of GPT-4 on multiple metrics."

The authors themselves reference other works that have employed the Socratic method for enhancing LLM prompting techniques. Thus, the differentiation of this research from the existing literature needs to be articulated more convincingly.\n\n2. My main concern revolves around the claims and experiment settings in the paper.\n1\uff09The paper claims that the proposed framework is \"both cost-efficient and robust to prompt writing and example selection\" needs stronger experimental validation. Although the cost analysis demonstrates that SOCREVAL incurs a cost that is less than 2.1 times that of GPT-4, the previous method, ROSCOE, uses a small language model that is far less costly than GPT-4. Additionally, the prompt robustness experiment lacks an exploration of the effect of different numbers of demonstrations on the performance, e.g., the number of demonstrations is 0.\n2) The paper does not compare SOCREVAL with other smaller LMs besides GPT-4, such as T5 or LLAMA. It is unclear how SOCREVAL would perform with different LLMs as evaluators.\n3) The paper does not provide any qualitative examples or case studies of SOCREVAL\u2019s outputs or errors. It would be helpful to see some concrete examples of how SOCREVAL generates prompts, scores reasoning chains, and explains its decisions."

Given that GPT-4 is likely to be much larger than the models in the previous method (ROSCOE), is it fair to compare them?"

From the experiment, the proposed prompting method is only validated on GPT-4. I wonder whether this method can improve the evaluation performance of other base models such as ChatGPT and open-sourced LLMs (e.g., LLaMA). If the proposed method only works well on GPT-4, its contribution will be relatively thin and GPT-4\u2019s ability may become the dominating factor for success.\n\n3. From Table 13-16, SocREval still underperforms ROSCOE in most of the error types on all the datasets. This needs more analysis because the ability to detect various types of reasoning errors is as important as providing an overall quality score in the reasoning evaluation task. Existing works like ROSCOE and RECEVAL mostly report the results on different reasoning error types in the main content.\n\n4. From Section 2.2, the authors instruct GPT-4 to generate qualitative analysis and pseudo references to help obtain a more accurate overall quality score. The quality of generated qualitative analysis and pseudo references should be assessed via human evaluation.\n\n\n[1] G-EVAL: Nlg evaluation using gpt-4 with better human alignment.\n\n[2] A training-free and reference-free summarization evaluation metric via centrality-weighted relevance and self-referenced redundancy.
