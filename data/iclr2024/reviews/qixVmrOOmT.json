In light of this challenge, the authors propose a method UMMAN which combines graph neural network to help learn the association between gut microbes and hosts.\n\nOriginal-Graphs, are constructed by using multiple relation-types, and then utilized to update the embedding of nodes through Graph Convolutional Networks. Attention mechanism is also introduced to update the embeddings of the corresponding nodes of the Multi-Graphs.\n\nThen the relationship among nodes of the Original-Graph is destroyed to get the corresponding Shuffled-Graph, which will be used for adversarial learning to obtain the correlation among nodes more reliably. The authors design the adversarial control group, i.e., keep the position of the edges unchanged, and randomly disrupt the nodes to train part of the discriminator at the same time.\n\nIn addition, the authors introduce the Node Feature Global Integration (NFGI) to describe a more comprehensive embedding of the graph with node-level stage and graph-level stage."

                "value": "1. Technical contribution is a bit marginal as both the applied model and the idea of contrast learning are somehow take-off-shelf.\n\n2. The motivation for applying GNN needs to be clearly explained i.e. why the columns in the tabular dataset are transformed into the nodes on a graph? Specifically, it is not very clear why some microbes are considered to be more correlated with each other and that they should be connected by an edge on a graph. The paper only provides a simple claim that two nodes are considered to be connected if the distance between their embeddings is below a variable threshold. It would be better if the authors could provide more details to illustrate the motivation. Moreover, as introducing graph machine learning to the field is one of the main contributions, it would be better if the authors could provide more details and instructions on the embedding process. For example, what are the features taken into consideration, the abundance level, the microbes' class, or anything else?\n\n3. The motivations of the proposed method (especially for Shffuled-Graph and NFGI) need to be clearly and explicitly explained. For example, it is not well motivated why we need to perturb the original graph by exchanging nodes.\n\nFor the claim that \u2018basic CNNs can't beat the traditional machine learning algorithm in this case (OTU datasets that are extended to table types) because the basic CNN\u2019s kernel cannot learn arbitrary transformed features, which is not suitable for OTU datasets,\u2019 it would be better for the authors to provide more details about the logic chain and explain what is meant by \"arbitrary transformed features\" in the context of OTU datasets.\nSimilarly, it would be better to tell more about why exchanging the column order in the tabular dataset will not affect the final result.In the introduction, it is mentioned that 'The exchange of rows and columns of the datasets do not affect the results of pattern recognition.'The authors should explain why this property is not desired i.e., why the authors desire to affect the results of pattern recognition by exchanging the rows and columns of the datasets and how it motivated them to propose their method.\n\nFor the proposed Shuffled-Graph, the motivation should also be explicitly illustrated. E.g., why some microbes are considered to be more correlated with each other, and what is the benefit of perturbing this kind of correlation? Why the Shuffled-Graph generated by breaking the correlation among nodes can be used as the negative adversarial control group, and why does such an adversarial learning method work?  It would be better for the authors to add proper references or experiments to support the claim that such perturbation should work.\nMoreover, for NFGI, why such a component is desired, and why do the authors design such a proposed graph-level stage instead of other graph-level operations such as pooling?\n\n4. It would be better if the authors could provide more details of the proposed methods, especially those of core contributions. E.g., how the K bins are chosen and decided for the GLD in NFGI.\n\n5.

Even some toy examples can provide a more comprehensive introduction for readers.\n\n3. Some notations appear in the equations for the first time and are not mentioned in the text.
