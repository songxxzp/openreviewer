The canonical methods in this space are Bayesian neural nets and ensembles, which are both computationally expensive, thus motivating this method. The proposed approach involves first building a Lipschitz-constrained model and then training normalizing flows on the feature descriptors. The data probabilities from the normalizing flows are combined with the softmax probabilities to yield \u201cdensity softmax\u201d, which is shown to minimize minimax uncertainty risk.

                "value": "**The role of the Lipschitz constraint is not conceptually clear; The resulting feature extractor may not even be 1-Lipschitz**\n\n(1)The method incorporates two components: a Lipschitz-constrained feature extractor and the density-softmax. Experiments (Sec 5.5) show that the Lipschitzness helps OOD generalization, while the density softmax helps in uncertainty estimation. These components are largely independent of each other conceptually, as presented in the paper. This makes it difficult to answer the question - is Lipschitness truly a necessary component of the solution? Or is the introduction of a mere robustness constraint (via $\\ell_2$ adversarial training, say) sufficient? Note that while 1-Lipschitz models are robust, robust models are not necessarily Lipschitz.\n\n(2)It is also unclear whether the proposed training results in a 1-Lipschitz model or feature extractor. Note that training a model with a gradient norm penalty is insufficient to train a 1-Lipschitz model, as mere regularization does not imply that the constraint is satisfied. To verify whether models achieve the 1-Lipschitz guarantee, the method either needs to use provable methods such as [1] or computationally verify the existence of a small Lipschitz constant using [2]. \n\n---\n\n**Missing comparison/discussion of a crucial baseline: joint probability estimation p(y,x)**\n\n\nOne alternate and simple way to incorporate knowledge of the input distribution is to estimate the joint probability $p(y, x) = p(y \\mid x) p(x)$ [3]. This can be done by simply multiplying the softmax probabilities with the density estimates from the normalizing flow in the case of this paper. Note that this estimate satisfies all the asymptotic properties that density softmax does. Given the conceptual simplicity of this approach, I am wondering whether the authors can comment on the similarities/differences between their approach and joint probability estimation.\n\n---\n\n**Incorrect statements in Theorem 4.3; Possible flaws in proof of minimax optimality (corollary 4.4)**\n\n(1)Theorem 4.3 shows the asymptotic behavior of density softmax. The statement claims that \u201cif $d(z_{iid}, Z) \\rightarrow 0$ then $p(z_{iid}, \\alpha) \\rightarrow 1$\u201d. However, this is clearly untrue, as the maximum value of distribution itself can be less than one.\n\nConsider for example the simple case of fitting a single multivariate Gaussian (i.e., a GMM with number of mixtures = 1) on data $Z$. Then clearly the max value of this distribution depends on the determinant of the covariance matrix, which can be any value, and in particular less than one if the determinant is large enough.\n\n(2)Outside of this scaling issue, consider that the in-distribution is sampled from a Gaussian mixture model with a number of mixtures = 2, with probabilities 0.1 and 0.9 respectively for the two mixture components. Thus $p(z_{iid} (mixture 2)) \\sim 9 \\times p(z_{iid} (mixture 1))$. In other words, the normalizing flow cannot assign equal probability to all input samples unless the input distribution is uniform.\n\n(3)Apart from the fact that the corollary builds on top of this possibly flawed theorem, it also makes the assumption that asymptotic conclusions derived for certain points $d(z_{iid},Z) \\rightarrow 0$ can be applied to **every** IID point. This is simply incorrect. There can exist IID points that simply haven\u2019t been sampled from the distribution yet and thus do not have near zero distances from the train set points.    \n\n---\n\n[1] Singla et al., Improved techniques for deterministic l2 robustness, 2022\n\n[2] Scaman et al., Lipschitz regularity of deep neural networks:\nanalysis and efficient estimation, 2018\n\n[3] Grathwohl et al., Your classifier is secretly an energy based model and you should treat it like one, 2020"

                "value": "Major concerns:\n\n1) My major concern is the novelty and overall contribution to the topic.\n\nThe same idea of using a density model (e.g. Normalizing flow) to scale  (by multiplication) some predicted parameters was used in NatPN [1]. I also wonder why, taking into account this similarity, the paper was not even discussed. It indeed was cited several times, but it was not discussed what is the gist of the method, and it was not compared.\n\nThe authors of the paper under review compared only with PostNet [2]. But there is a difference in parametrization between NatPN [1] and PostNet [2]. In [2] they learned a flow per class (which appeared to be redundant) and in the follow-up (and generalized) paper they introduced another parametrization, which needs only one flow (or another density model) overall. This explains why Latency for Posterior Net [2] scales with the number of classes (which should not be the case for NatPN [1]).\nMoreover, in the problem of [1], they want to predict parameters of Dirichlet distribution, which is helpful as it allows them to distinguish between high aleatoric/epistemic uncertainties naturally. The parametrization of these predicted parameters of Dirichlet was in the form of the product of the density model and \"update\" to Dirichlet parameters. In the paper under review, authors do the same, but directly scale logits. \n\nSo it seems to me that it is pretty same idea, the same computational overhead (train one density model). The only difference is that in [1] they did the trick for the \"second-order\" distribution (which is Dirichlet), but here for the \"first-order\" distribution (Categorical), which does not have apparent benefits.\n\n\n2) Normalization of the p(z; \\alpha) to be in [0, 1]. I find it pretty strange and unnatural. First, why it is even an issue? How is it possible to have extremely large p(z;\\alpha), given well trained Lipschitz feature extractor? Since we train the density model on top of the fixed extracted features (and well separated), it is surprising it is a problem. \nSecond, in the proof of Proposition 4.7, the fact that p(z; \\alpha) is in [0, 1] is used. I wonder if will it be possible to prove it given p(z; \\alpha) is still restricted, but say in [0, C], where C > 1.\n\n\n3) Using the Lipschitz network is also not something new. I wonder why this option to satisfy the Lipschitz constraint was chosen (gradient penalty)?\nIn the Future Work there is a phrase \"We plan to .... developing new techniques to avoid computing Jacobian matrix at training-time...\" -- why iterative spectral normalization method (based on power method) [3] is not used for this purpose? It was applied in SNGP for example, in a paper cited by authors.\n\n\nMinor concerns:\n\n\n1) In the introduction: \"However, it often struggles with over-confidence and overfitting (Guo et al., 2017). This poor performance **usually occurs when the test data is far and does not come from the same distribution as the training set**\" -- I am a bit skeptical about it, as in [4] they observed this issue without shift when P_train(x, y) != P_test(x, y).\n2) In the introduction: \"recent sampling-based approaches...\" but cited papers from 2016 and 2018.\n3) In the introduction: I think the reference to Deep Ensembles should be [5].\n4) In Proposition 4.7, why only an overconfident case is considered?\n5) I did not find, what type of flow is used in the experiments?\n\n\n\n[1] - Charpentier B. et al.

The proposed method has some troubles outperforming deep ensembles, but this is understandable as a single model is used while ensembles have much larger complexity.\n- The experimental evaluation is very comprehensive, it covers task performance on multiple datasets and networks, uncertainty quality from multiple aspects, including calibration error for in and out of distribution datasets (with corrupted versions of datasets), and quality of feature density estimation and its relation to out of distribution examples."

This paper defines DDU which uses 1-Lipschitz networks and feature space density as a signal for epistemic uncertainty, while softmax outputs are used for aleatoric uncertainty. The proposed method Density-Softmax is a direct competitor of DDU. \n\nTo me it is very clear that at least DUQ and DDU are clear baselines, specially DDU, as to me the only difference between Density-Softmax and DDU is the use of normalizing flows for density estimatin and combination of feature density into the softmax activation in the last layer.\n\n- Also a notable point is that DDU outperforms most of the baselines used in this paper (like SNGP and ERM) and is very competitive with ensembles, producing better uncertainty than 5 ensembles in the out of distribution setting, and having slightly lower calibration error. This supports my proposal that Density-Softmax should be compared to DDU. DDU has been part of the public literature for around a year.\n- One important concept that seems to be missing from this paper is aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Feature density estimates epistemic uncertainty (shown and proven in the DDU paper), while softmax probabilities model aleatoric uncertainty. Since the proposed model Density-Softmax modifies softmax probabilities, these now are more closely estimating epistemic uncertainty, and then, what component of the model outputs aleatoric uncertainty? This could be a possible disadvantage of this model.\n\nMinor Comments\n- The links to each abbreviation, highlighted in red, are a bit too much distraction, I suggest that for abbreviations, the authors turn off the links highlighted in red, the reader will thank you. I would even suggest to replace link boxes with colored links using hyperref options.\n- In Figure 1, each plot contains the x and y axis labels, these do not really add any new information to the figure and I suggest to remove them, for cleanliness.\n- Overall the paper focuses too much into mathematical detais and proofs, I would suggest to add the intuition of Density-Softmax close to the beginning of the paper, the user only finds out how the method works in around page 4-5, and the intuition is simple, scale logits with the feature density, which conceptually is similar to temperature scaling with a variable temperature."

                "value": "In this paper, the authors present a framework for uncertainty quantification by combining the classification with density estimation to identify any test-time distribution shifts. This allows estimating model confidence with one single forward pass, as compared to most BNN approaches or ensemble methods that require multiple forward passes at test time. The authors present results comparing their approach with other existing approaches on the image classification task (also involving test-time distribution shifts)"

                "value": "- Popular methods for uncertainty quantification, such as deep ensembles, involve multiple forward passes (at least in a naive implementation) and as a result can be computationally prohibitive. I like that this paper proposes a single-pass approach.\n\n- The overall approach is very intuitive - having a density estimation to alter the model confidence is an understandable strategy. \n\nI also applaud the fact that the authors have made their implementation available publicly and anonymously."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The main weakness of this paper is that it doesn't look into other recent methods proposed - including those that involve direct uncertainty estimation [1-3], and distillation of BNNs/ensembles [4, 5].\n\n- As the authors have noted, it seems that the proposed approach would have a higher training time and higher memory requirements due to the Jacobian matrix in the regularization term. \n\nReferences\n\n[1] Lahlou, S., Jain, M., Nekoei, H., Butoi, V.

That would add more flexibility to the overall approach and improve performance, I believe. \n\n- Can the authors comment on how their approach would compare with other distillation approaches highlighted earlier? \n\n- Do the authors have some insights on how the entire algorithm can be made faster?"
