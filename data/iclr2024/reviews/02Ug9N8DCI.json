The model employs a state space model (SSM) with data-controlled state transitions to incorporate the inputs at multiple steps, hence overcoming known issues of standard linear recurrent models in language modeling (such as associative recall). To increase efficiency, they propose a parallelized version of the proposed method using associative scan computation, which improved complexity to $O(l \\log l)$, where $l$ is the sequence length. The model is parametrized according to recent developments in signal propagation for linear recurrent units, i.e. by parametrizing the state transitions in polar form.

One of my main concerns is the experimental evidence provided and its methodology.  \n\n    a. **Evidence**: In the abstract, it is stated that \"GateLoop empirically outperforms existing models for auto-regressive language modeling\", but the evidence is provided on only one task. I believe that for a paper with no theory that claims practical advantages, empirical verification should be exhaustive. \n\n    b. **Methodology**. The baselines are reported from an existing paper, and it is unclear if the comparison is fair. For instance, are the models trained with the same number of steps? Were the hyperparameters tuned consistently with the reported baselines?\n2. **Motivation**. In its current form, the paper does not provide enough justification for the proposed method. Why should it perform better than H3 and its variants? The differences to H3 should be made clearer. H3 also has multiplicative interaction to effectively compare the representations of different tokens in the sequence. The authors only say that \"[H3] employs SSMs in conjunction with data-controlled element-wise gating\". It would be helpful if the differences were made more explicit. \nMinor:\n3. The model's description in section 3 should be made clearer. In particular, it is my understanding that the $k_n$ and $v_n$ values depend both on the input and weight matrices. That should be made more explicit. This can be also done for instance by outlining the algorithm/pseudo code of the forward pass of the proposed layer. \n4.

For 3.2 specifically, time-variance does not affect parallel-scan compatibility with recurrences. See e.g, section 1.4.1 in Blelloch's \"Prefix Sums and Their Applications\", where the state-to-state parameters $a_i$ are already specified with a dependence on time. Can the authors elaborate on what is new or interesting about their exposition? (other than the diagram, which I appreciate!). For 3.3, it would have been useful to visualize the resulting surrogate attention matrices learned in some synthetic or language tasks. Could you elaborate on why you think this specific reweighting of queries and keys, resulting from the underlying time-varying system, is an appropriate parametrization? \n* Is your surrogate attention matrix complex? Do you find any meaningful performance difference compared to a time-varying system with real states? How does the fact your parallel scan operates on a complex-valued sequence affect performance? It would be useful to see these comparisons.\n* You use a sigmoid to parametrize the magnitude of the poles of the system. Can you motivate this choice further, ideally with an ablation study? I am not convinced the quality difference would be significant.\n* The results in Table 1 are strange, especially given the fact that the authors did not rerun the baseline numbers. The perplexity gap is larger, ~13 perplexity is generally too low for small (125M) models on wikitext. As this is the only experiment, can you provide more details? Model depth, width, parametrization, learning rates, batch size, sequence length...\n* How does this model compare to other gated recurrences with time-variance (e.g., GRUs, LSTMs). \n* There are broken links and references e.,g section ? just before equation 9. \n\nIn summary: the idea to introduce time-variance in this way is simple and (potentially) effective. The experiments are, however, incomplete, and the novelty limited."

This brings me to my next point.\n3) experiments: supporting the whole paper is a single experiment, a single perplexity number: 13.4.

Some details of the model definition are not explained (see questions).\n4. Overall the submission is sparse in content; it is substantially under the page limit, and large portions of the paper are dedicated to explaining prior work without providing new substance. For example, Section 3.2 on the efficient scan computation is a nice illustration but not appropriate as a contribution for an ICLR-quality paper. I would not consider it a generalization of prior work, as it is clear that the original scan operator introduced by S5 readily generalizes beyond the time-invariant setting; in fact, their experiment in Section 6.3 is applied directly to a time-varying setting."

While Figure 5 defines the activations, how are $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ defined? Also what are the dimensionalities of $a_n$? It appears as if they are scalars in this paper, but it also claims to generalize prior SSMs which have matrix-valued $A_n$ transitions.\n2. Was the surrogate attention mode implemented (like in RetNet), or just a theoretical connection?\n3. The hyperparameters (Table 2) say the number of heads equals the model dimension, which seems to imply a head size of $1$. This seems at odds with the connection to multi-head attention -- why was this chosen? (I suspect it is related to the next question?)\n4. How is the efficiency of the model compared to prior work? One of the motivations for the prior time-invariant SISO models (e.g. S4 and S4D) was incorporating a larger effective state size without materializing a larger latent state, which required convolutions. If it is true that a larger head dimension is not feasible, I think it is worth mentioning as a limitation.\n5. While data-controlled transitions makes sense from an expressivity point of view -- it should be strictly more expressive than LTI models -- in practice, expressivity does not always predict performance as it is at odds with inductive bias. The original line of work on S4 models emphasized that they were actually designed for uniformly-sampled data such as audio instead of data such as language; this paper does not provide intuition for *why* and *when* one should expect GateLoop to perform better or worse than the prior models with fixed transitions."
