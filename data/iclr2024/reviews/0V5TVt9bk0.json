Accordingly, this paper proposed Q-Bench, a holistic benchmark of MLLMs for low-level visual perception, low-level visual description, and overall visual quality assessment. Q-Bench constructs solid benchmark datasets and reasonable evaluation pipelines, including LLVisionQA for low-level perception ability, LLDescribe for low-level description ability, and a compounded IQA dataset for image quality assessment with an innovative softmax-based strategy. Q-Bench provides a viable solution to reveal the potential of MLLMs for low-level visual understanding."
