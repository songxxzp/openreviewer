                "value": "This paper investigates subsampling in supervised learning. It begins by assuming a collection of labeled data points, denoted as $\\left(x_i, y_i\\right)_{i \\leq N}$, which are drawn as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from a given distribution, denoted as $P$. Additionally, they introduce a surrogate model, denoted as $\\hat{P}(y \\vert x)$, which is capable of predicting labels more effectively than random guessing. The central objective, in the absence of access to the true labels of the data points, is to leverage the surrogate model to perform subsampling on the training data, resulting in a reduced dataset of size $n = \\gamma N$, where $\\gamma$ is a parameter in the range of $(0,1)$. This reduced dataset is then used to train the final model.\n\nThe experiments conducted by the authors have shown some intriguing outcomes. Firstly, the choice of subsampling strategy seems to have a significant impact, offering more than mere randomness in the process of reducing the samples. Secondly, in specific cases, subsampling can actually yield lower estimation errors during testing. It's worth noting that this study is supported by a solid framework of theoretical guarantees.\n\nWhile the authors have made notable strides in their experimental validations, I believe some theoretical aspects remain unaddressed through analytical tools. Several propositions and theorems presented inside the paper are scattered and might be considered as ancillary results. Nevertheless, this paper is still a solid theoretical work with robust mathematical underpinnings. The theoretical formulation of the problem and the experimental observations collectively present a nice contribution to the field, which makes this work a nice addition to ICLR. My vote is in favor of acceptance, and I am open to revising my evaluation should the authors give convincing responses to the questions raised in the Questions and Weaknesses sections."

                "value": "- The primary limitation of this paper, to the best of my understanding, is that all mathematical analyses beyond Section 4 assume that the surrogate model is equivalent to the optimal Bayes conditional distribution. In other words, the sample selection process somewhat presumes knowledge of the true label distributions. Consequently, the authors have not been able to provide a sound theoretical justification for the \"magic\" effects claimed in Figure 1. This drawback significantly affects the significance of the work, in my opinion.\n\n- Theorem 1 asserts that $\\rho_{\\mathrm{unb}}/\\rho_{\\mathrm{nr}}$ can grow arbitrarily large by selecting the feature vectors' distribution in an adversarial manner. However, can the same be said for $\\rho_{\\mathrm{nr}}/\\rho_{\\mathrm{unb}}$? What happens when the feature vectors' distribution is more generic, such as Gaussian? Without additional guarantees in these respects, the theorem may lack substantial significance.\n\n- All the mathematical analyses in this work are based on asymptotic conditions ($n,N\\rightarrow\\infty$ with $n/N\\rightarrow\\gamma$), which remain intriguing but could be expanded to encompass a broader scope. For instance, non-asymptotic guarantees and cases where $n/N\\rightarrow 0$ could be explored. \n\n- The section related to high-dimensional analysis exclusively considers a linear model with Gaussian feature vectors. Additionally, it assumes that $N/p$ converges to a known constant. These assumptions offer room for extension and relaxation.\n\n- This paper is densely packed with intricate mathematical statements, often presented in a dense manner. Many results, sometimes unrelated, may require more context and explanation than a \"9-page limit\" can accommodate. In this regard, the authors might consider submitting their work to a journal to allow for a more comprehensive presentation.\n\n- Paper has no conclusions section.\n\n**Minor comments**:\n- In Theorem 2: \"an non-empty\" -> \"a non-empty\"."

Obviously, this assumption makes sense when using a linear model. However, does it alter the generality of the presented framework in any shape or form?\n\n- **In Figure 1, how do you justify the reduction in estimation error after subsampling?** The way I have understood the experiment: \"Full data\" curve uses all the 34345 data samples with **true** labels. On the other hand, the proposed scheme (in the case of a weak surrogate model) \n- - 1) First, uses only 1472 samples (with true labels) from another fraction of the dataset in order to train a surrogate model. \n- - 2) You use the above-mentioned surrogate model to select, say, 50% of the dataset (without seeing their true labels, right?), and then \n- - 3) The training procedure considers the true labels, only for the above-mentioned selected samples, and uses them for training the main model. \n\nAt the end, the main model outperforms the \"Full data\" curve. Is it because the surrogate model has been trained too good? can you please also report the estimation error of the weak and strong surrogate models? Also, it should be noted that Theorem 2 only shows that there \"exists\" cases for which $\\rho_{\\mathrm{nr}}$ is not monotonic. But it does not prove error can become lower than that of a full data ERM.\n\n- **Assumption A.1 (in Proposition B.1)**: I am a little confused here... In Proposition 4.1, do we have to assume that A.1 (of Proposition B.1) holds? Or the subsampling strategy that is guaranteed to minimize $\\rho_{\\mathrm{unb}}$ automatically satisfies this condition? (i.e., forcing the minimizers of $R_S$ and $R$ to coincide with each other)\n\n- **What (or should I say: Where) is $b(x)$ in Proposition 4.3**?"

(non-convex losses and models)\n- Related to the previous question, how applicable is the method to various non-linear models? For example, any model that contains non-trivial non-linearity, such as a two-layer network?\n- Is it possible to use gradient-based and similar approximate procedures that require low subsampling error over the whole parameters space to converge (difference between Loss under subsampled data and full data to be small not only at the optimal values of parameters)? \n- There is an extensive theory of data selection in the case when labels are known (in that case there are methods that guarantee low multiplicative or additive error over whole parameters space, far from optimum, when comparing full and subsampled datasets); would it be possible to evaluate the proposed model against such prior art, for example, considering a \"perfect oracle\" that exactly predicts the labels in the proposed setting?"
