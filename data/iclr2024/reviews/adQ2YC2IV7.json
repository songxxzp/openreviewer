The hierarchical policy consists of two parts: a \"visionary leader\" and a \"follower\". The leader suggests multiple high-level problem-solving tactics or hints, while the follower carries out detailed reasoning based on each of these high-level instructions. For each leader's directive, the follower samples multiple reasoning chains to create a group of potential solutions. To select the best solution from these groups, the authors introduce a tournament-based selection method. Experimental results on the MATH dataset show that this approach generates meaningful hints, and improves the accuracy of the final answer on challenging problems."

                "value": "1. Generally I am not very sure about the novelty of the proposed method. I am mostly familiar w/ the math reasoning works but not familiar w/ the topic of LLM planning. The novelty may be a weakness; or may not --- I would like to refer to the opinions from other reviewers.\n2. Some descriptions of the method/experiment are confusing. Equation (1) and the relevant text is an example. The authors integrate w.r.t. $h$, so they treat $Pr(A|h,Q)$ as a probability density function so the integral $Pr(A|Q)$ should be a probability mass function. Yet the authors use the same notation $Pr$ which is quite confusing. More importantly, although we can understand what the authors would like to express after reading the whole section, the equation itself is invalid as $h$ is a discrete random variable rather than a continuous random variable so you cannot integrate w.r.t. $h$. Please note that mathematical notations in a paper is for helping readers to understand your idea more easily; but Equation (1) is not helping but instead making it even harder to understand. Actually, the key point of the section is just one sentence: \"More generally, our strategy samples all the different hints returned by $\\pi_{high}$ with equal probabilities.\". And this is already clear enough. Similar feelings also appear in the section introducing the \"Grouped-Majority Recall\" metric, where the authors use quite long paragraphs to explain the details of it but the organization is not quite good and thus make it not easy to get the motivation of proposing this new metric. We generally suggest the authors to improve the expression and organization in these sections for better readability.\n3. I may miss it but it seems there is no discussion about the accuracy/effectiveness of the tournament-based selection. IMO, it's non-trivial for LLM to accurately select the best answer among $n$ by iteratively comparing pair by pair. The authors do not provide the reason of introducing this new approach and why not use alternatives like another majority voting over the $n$ candidates. Also, it is possible to make a majority voting over the $n \\times m$ candidates directly; the authors do not demonstrate the necessity of the hierarchical selection strategy that majority votes within each group to get $n$ candidates first and select by tournament."
