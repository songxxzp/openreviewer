However, the number of pocket-ligand complex structures is quite limited in existing datasets. (2) To address this issue, the authors generate over 5 million complexes by segmenting fragments and their corresponding pockets in protein structures. By aligning features of fragments and pockets, the pocket encoder learns the interaction between fragments and pockets. The authors design downstream tasks such as pocket druggability prediction, pocket matching, and ligand binding affinity prediction to demonstrate the effectiveness of ProFSA."

The bound of Theorem 3.1 is trivial. The authors claim that the bound naturally exists for these representations extracted by pretrained molecule models. However, it's a bit counterintuitive, because many models not pretrained on molecule datasets also fulfill this prior. So, can these models be used for this task? **I strongly suggest removing this part from the paper**.\n\n3. Some issues about dataset creation:\n - 3.1. The authors consider the distribution of ligand size and pocket size when designing the dataset. However, molecules possess more properties that can also lead to imbalance. It would be better to, at least, add some discussion about this issue.\n - 3.2. In the second stage of the data construction process, the approach to defining pockets needs further explanation or an ablation study.\n\n4. Experiments: It would be better to add some biological justification or visualization of the results.\n\nFor this paper, one fact is that the technical novelty is below the bar of ICLR. However, I admire the simple but effective model for the right question. It's a struggle for me to make a decision. I will maintain a neutral attitude and make my final decision after the discussion."
