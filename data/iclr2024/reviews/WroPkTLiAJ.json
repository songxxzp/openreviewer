In Section 3 various subsections are sequentially presented; but the subsections are not connected well, it is hard to follow the sequence of methodology through text. The algorithm should be put into main text, and well connected to the sections. I would suggest rewriting the algorithm in more details and possibly adding a figure as an overview.  \n- The authors call their method 'personalized'. In personalized FL the inference is made through individual models of the clients. But, as far as I understand, the output of your methodology is a single global model that would hopefully work for every client; although you obtain local posteriors they are just intermediators for the global model training. If this is the case, this is not a personalized method but a heterogeneous FL method. Otherwise, please clarify. \n- I think the current experiments are not enough to show the efficacy of the method. In particular, majority of the experiments are done with 20 clients, which is small for the FL. Also, there is no comparison to local only training. \n- More experiments with higher number of clients should be added to text if possible. Also the performance change w.r.t number of clients and data samples should be reported. \n- Lack of experiments on synthetically generated data is not desirable for such a statistically motivated method."

Mathematical definitions are not precise.** To add to the writing issues, in many places the mathematical notation/assumptions are not properly defined. Some examples are given below\n* The second proportionality in Eq. (2) holds only under the flat prior assumption, i.e. $p(\\theta) \\sim 1$. The authors have not stated this clearly. \n* In the line with the definition of Kronecker product (just below Eq. (10)), the authors are missing an expectation in the definition of $A_{kl}$ and $B_{kl}$.\n* Section 3.5: What is $\\bar{\\Sigma}$ and $\\bar{z}$ ? In Section 3.4, the authors have just defined $\\bar{\\Sigma}_l$ and $\\bar{z}_l$ for a layer $l$. \n* Section 3.5: \"optimal solution of $\\bar{\\mu}$\" -> \"optimal solution of $f(\\bar{\\mu})$\". Optimal solution of a vector does not make sense.\n* Section 3.5: \"As we have $\\mu = \\bar{\\Sigma}\\cdot \\bar{z}$\"- > the authors already defined $\\bar{\\mu} = vec(\\bar{M})$ earlier in the same line. I'm not sure what re-definition is doing. \n\n\n**3. No connection with personalization.** The title of the paper states \"Personalized One Shot Federated Learning\". The authors also write about the benefits of personalization in paragraph 4 of the Introduction section. However, the rest of the paper just focuses on the server learning a single global model. I don't understand what is the connection with personalization here. \n\n**4. Limited novelty, missing references, privacy concerns.** The idea of formulating FL as a posterior inference problem is already well-known (Al Shedivat et al. 2020) and the idea of approximating the Hessian as the Fisher is also standard  (Ritter et al. 2018). Moreover, the resulting concept of using the Fisher information to aggregate models has already been well-explored in previous work [1], which the authors have not cited. The only difference here is that FedLPA proposes to use the K-FAC while [1] uses the diagonal Fisher. However, I feel this is not significant enough novelty. Moreover, implementing the K-FAC requires clients to send $A_k, B_k, M_k$ matrices which increases communication compared to just the diagonal Fisher. The authors also claim without any justification that $A_k,B_k, M_k$ preserve the data/label privacy.  This claim has to be supported by empirical evidence/theory in order for it to be justified.\n\n\n\n**5. Weak baselines and easy datasets.** Among the baselines, I understand the comparison with FedAvg to show improvement over simple averaging. However SCAFFOLD, FedNova and FedProx are not good one-shot baselines. These methods are primarily designed for multi-round FL and therefore I am not surprised to see that their performance is similar to FedAvg in the experiments. DENSE is the only one-shot basline which can be considered competitive. The authors have cited other one-shot algorithms like FedOV and FedCAVE but have not compared to them based on the argument that they entail sharing more client side information. However, I think it fair to compare with these algorithms since FedLPA also requires clients to share and $A_k$ and $B_k$ matrices. \n\nFedLPA seems to outperform baselines significantly only for easier datasets such as FMNIST, MNIST and SVHN. For CIFAR-10 (which can be considered as the hardest dataset), the improvement over DENSE seems to reduce. Therefore I was interested in seeing the performance of FedLPA for even harder datasets such CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet as done in the DENSE paper. In addition, the paper would be significantly strengthened if the authors considered more realistic FL datasets such as EMNIST and Shakespeare [2]."

Instead of gradients, the authors propose FedLPA that computes the local posteriors in a layer-wise manner and aggregates them to form the global posterior, which is later used to update the global model. To this end, the authors approximate the posteriors with Laplacian approximation and empirical fisher matrices. An additional approximation with a multi-variate linear objective is proposed to estimate the global parameters and avoid the potential bias of Fisher matrices induced by the independence assumption that prior works have. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance over classical federated optimization and a one-shot FL baseline in various data skewness settings."

Since heterogeneous data makes one-shot FL challenging, the authors propose a Layer-wise Posterior Aggregation strategy called FedLPA. One of the main motivations behind this strategy is to improve the performance under non-iid data distribution and avoid leaking clients' sensitive data such as the label distribution."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper claims several times that FedLPA prevents additional leakage of user data at the one-shot step. Specifically, the claim is that the server only receives A, B, and M without any auxiliary information -- which should preserve the data/label privacy for the clients. However, A, B, and M do carry information about the client data since A and B are found from the empirical Fisher information matrix which is a function of the dataset and the locally trained model. So, if I am not missing something, A, B, and M are already a function of both the data and the labels. Then, how is this claim about privacy valid?"

Given that  $A_k$, $B_k$, $M_k$ are found via data-dependent empirical Fisher information matrix, how does FedLPA preserve data/label privacy?"
