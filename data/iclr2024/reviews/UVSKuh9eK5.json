The authors also propose to measure the compositional generalization via the normalized mutual information between objects and attributes, and use Z-Diff Score, DCI-Informativeness, Explicitness score, and DCIMIG metrics to evaluate the disentanglement in the embeddings from the models."

It is ensured that the generated compositions are not present in the CLIP training datasets.

We aim to address these issues in this paper, by focusing our attention on the compositional generalization\nin the single object setting, and designing an authentic test dataset to assess the training data characteristics and mechanisms in the models that lead to the OoD generalization.*\" -- This contradicts the following statement where the authors claim that they verify that the ImageNet-AO images are not a part of several CLIP training dataset -- \"*To ensure these combinations were not present in the CLIP training set, we conducted a thorough search and removed any combinations that were found.*\"\n- \"*By assessing the captions in the training sets, we guarantee that none of the captions in our test dataset or similar captions are included in the CLIP training data.*\" \n    - Is this check done for all the other datasets considered in the paper as well (LAION, YFCC15m, CC12m, and DataComp)?\n    -  A similar check should be done on images as well, it is possible that such images with different captions are present in the training set. Usually, captions from web sources are not exactly descriptive of the image.\n- \"*We also found that the CLIPs that show higher OoD generalization typically exhibit strong disentangled text representations. Furthermore, such CLIPs also enjoy a more disentangled image representation with respect to the attributes and objects as well.*\" -- the experiments in the paper do hint at the above statement. But this does not necessarily imply the following: \"*Specifically, a dataset with diverse compositions of attribute-objects facilitates a more disentangled text representation, which in turn induces a disentangled image representation through contrastive learning.*\" It could be possible that diverse images lead to disentangled image representations as well. \n- \"*To evaluate the degree of disentanglement in the training captions utilized by the CLIP, we conducted an analysis by measuring the normalized mutual information (NMI) between the object class and attribute tokens, whose domains are defined based on the captions in our generated dataset.*\" -- Could the authors explain how the domains are defined based on the captions in the generated dataset? More details on how the NMI is measured would be helpful.\n- Fig.4 - It is not clear how the disentanglement metrics are computed for the image encoder. \n- \"*We aimed for a diverse set of class names to enhance the complexity of the generated images.*\" -- It is not clear if all 1000 classes were used or only a subset. If a subset was used, how was this chosen?\n- \"*This dataset was produced by creating compositional images via a text-to-image model, using an Attribute+Object template.*\" -- could the authors give more details/ a citation for the Attribute+Object template?\n- Could the authors provide details on where the 30 adjectives were chosen from?\n- \"*Lastly, human evaluation was used to validate the generated images, with images not closely aligning with their prompts removed. After this process, around 12000 combinations remained, for which we successfully generated near 50000 accurate, high-quality images.*\" - The order of the two statements may have to be swapped? Could the authors provide details on how this human evaluation was done?\n- \"*For the test sets, all 1000 classes of ImageNet were used as the in-distribution set and expanded the number of classes to approximately 12000 for the OoD set.*\" -- could the authors share how the captions were created for the OOD set? Sharing some examples would be helpful. I believe the 80 captions are used only for the ID set, and single relevant captions are used for the OOD set?\n- In Fig.1, for a more fair comparison, the image-only models such as DINO-v2 and BEiT-v2 should also be trained on the datasets that were used for training CLIP (by using only the images, and ignoring the captions). Without matching at least the image datasets, there is not enough evidence to support the following statement - \"*We interpret these findings as strong evidence that the inclusion of language supervision, particularly during CLIP training, positively impacts the model representation quality, hence making it possible to generalize to unseen compositions, despite the absence of such compositions in their training data.*\"\n\nNitpicks -\n\n- citation format seems non-standard - (x) vs. [x]\n- inline citations should use the format xyz et al., rather than [x] \n- A citation for the work that defines \"compositional OOD generalization\" would be helpful"

Conclusion are less convincing due to the limited candidate in each experiment.
