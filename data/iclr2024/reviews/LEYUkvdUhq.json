What is the same model budget and explain how beta is introduced as an equation?\n 4. Three matching methods were proposed in git-rebasin: activation matching, weight matching, and STE. Which method is the baseline in Table 1 and 2? I doubt the claim that permutation alone makes it difficult to merge models on different datasets. According to [1], using STE, which is a permutation base, and Merge models with cifar10(5+5), it is reported that 90% accuracy is achieved, which is 10% more accurate than zipit. I think the conditions are the same as zipit!20/20 in terms of combining all layers.\n 5. Sec 5.1 says \" `If allow the last stage of the network to remain unzipped (i.e., zip up to 13 layers), our method obtains 83.8%, which is only 3.6% behind an ensemble of model A and model B (which is practically the upper bound for this setting)`\", but how can ensemble be guaranteed to be uppper bound?  In [1], a merging model is reported that can achieve higher accuracy than an ensemble. The upper limit of joint accuracy is the accuracy of the model trained on all data, rather than the accuracy of the ensemble.\n 6. Why is partially zipping more accurate than fully zipping?\n 7. How much gpu is needed for Imagenet-1k (200+200)? I am concerned about the memory and computational cost required to compute the correlation matrix.  \n[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05641\n\n\n\n\n===========================================\n\nComments after reading the rebuttal.\n\n===========================================\n\nSince I was unable to set the readers to everyone in the reply, I am writing my comments here.\n\nThank you for your kind reply.\nI did not understand that merging models using loss like STE is outside the scope of this study.\nSince this has been resolved in regards to many of my questions, I would like to raise my score.\n\nAs other reviwers have pointed out, it would be helpful to specify as a limitation in the camera-ready version of the paper that the model must be wide enough to perform."

The idea of merging weights both within and across models is simple, but achieves reasonably good performance under different conditions in the experiments. It's great that experiments with merging tasks of different modalities (classification, segmentation) are also done and the method still achieves reasonable performances, showing that the method is generalizable to non-classification tasks.

Please see the weakness section for more details.\n\n3. It would also be interesting to include additional experiments on more compact architectures such as Mobilenet for a more comprehensive analysis of the behavior of the method. It is great that ZipIt! is already evaluated on models with larger widths (x1.5 in Table 7). I think it might be harder to merge models where the architectures are already compact because there might be less overlap and less redundancy of features.\n\n4. Can BN be removed before applying ZipIt by fusing it into Conv (using that BN is an affine transform when mean and variance are fixed)? I think then the process to reset BN after merge can be avoided."
