This work proposes Graph Dissipation Model (GDM) to learn the latent intrinsic distributions of the graph based on the diffusion models, which enables the learned representations to be utilized for any downstream tasks. To encode both node feature and structural information, GDM introduces a coupled diffusion model framework consisting of a feature diffusion process and a structure diffusion process. Laplacian smoothing is innovatively used as a noise source for the feature diffusion process and edge removal is also defined as a noise source for the structure diffusion process. Experiments on both link prediction and node classification show that GDM achieves comparable performance for existing graph representation learning baselines on both tasks, demonstrating GDM's capability of learning universal factors that can be applied to any downstream tasks."

In this work, the authors did not mention the time complexity of GDM and its runtime in experiments.
