                "value": "For fast and standardized evaluation of Neural Architecture Search algorithms, it is important to develop various benchmarks that contain a large set of architectures and their quality measured with diverse performance metrics. In this vein, the paper builds and releases a new NAS benchmark that considers not only the standard accuracy of evaluated architectures but also their robustness against adversarial attacks. The authors extend the existing NAS-Bench-201 benchmark by adversarially training the NAS-Bench-201 architectures and evaluating them on clean and perturbed data. The proposed robust NAS benchmark is named NAS-RobBench-201. Additionally, the authors theoretically characterize the robust generalization performance of architectures using the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework."

Given the enormous computational cost of adversarial training and evaluating a large number of architectures, I believe the authors really have done an impressive set of experiments.\n- I generally agree with the necessity to create a NAS benchmark that targets robustness and generalization beyond standard test data.\n- I do not feel confident enough to review and comment on the more theoretical parts of the paper. The proofs were not reviewed thoroughly, and thus I cannot vouch for its correctness. I am, however, familiar with the NTK theory, and I find the idea of extending the NTK-based analysis to explain adversarial robustness interesting."

                "value": "- Currently, the robust accuracy is measured only under FGSM and PGD attacks. I think the performance under stronger attack methods (e.g., AutoAttack) is necessary to make the benchmark more reliable.\n- The authors observe that the standard and robust accuracies exhibit a meaningful level of correlation. If they are, do we really need a separate robustness benchmark that includes robust accuracies? Wouldn\u2019t searching for the optimal architecture in a conventional sense work as a good proxy and naturally result in a more robust architecture?\n- I believe that NAS-Bench-201 is too constrained of a search space to accurately reflect the vastness of the potential architecture pool. For instance, [1] shows that many NTK-based methods fail outside the boundary of NAS-Bench-201. While this is a good first step towards building a more comprehensive robustness benchmark, it would be great if the authors could show that the experimental and theoretical analyses hold outside the tested search space.\n- It would be nice to include the performance of trained architectures on out-of-distribution data and/or datasets with distribution shift in the benchmark. Incorporating these other types of robustness would make the benchmark more comprehensive, especially considering that in real deployment scenarios, the architectures will encounter generic OOD data more often than adversarially-perturbed data.\n- In section 4.4, the authors study the correlation between the minimum eigenvalue of the NTK matrix and robust accuracy. I understand that this NTK-score is derived from theoretical resultss, but have the authors studied the relationship between other NTK-based scores (e.g., condition number [2]) and robust accuracy?\n\n[1] Mok, Jisoo, et al. \"Demystifying the neural tangent kernel from a practical perspective: Can it be trusted for neural architecture search without training?.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022.\n[2] Chen, Wuyang, Xinyu Gong, and Zhangyang Wang. \"Neural Architecture Search on ImageNet in Four GPU Hours: A Theoretically Inspired Perspective.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2020."

This significant advancement is poised to benefit researchers focusing on robust architecture search in the future immensely.\n2. The analyses conducted within this adversarial search space are considered to be novel. It is particularly noteworthy to observe cross-sectional evidence in the NAS search space, confirming the expectation that a 3x3 kernel size CNN layer contributes to robustness. Additionally, the findings concerning the correlation between clean accuracy and robustness in the face of adversarial attacks are intriguing.\n3. The paper is well-written, offering clarity and ease of comprehension."

It remains unclear why robust NTK requires a double perturbation when conventional adversarial training typically examines generalization from a single perturbation.\n2. While it is posited that robust accuracy is influenced by the adversarial term, the theoretical analysis provided appears to be a reiteration of what was presented by Zhu et al. and Cao et al. in the context of clean NTK. Consequently, the contribution in this area seems minimal. Notably, the robust term A*(x,W), which is contingent on W and x, was not accounted for in the theoretical framework and was instead treated as an independent input variable. This oversight could impact the applicability of the theoretical analysis.\n3. The paper employs an evaluation metric that is not standard, raising questions about its normalization. The last part of page 4, in the dataset paragraph, should clarify whether the metric is normalized before the attack and then inputted into the model. Additionally, it would be beneficial if the authors specified whether the same perturbation radius (32x32) used for ImageNet was applied during training."

It would be interesting to learn about the correlation results when measured with the existing clean NTK, such as in previous works by Zhu et al. and Cao et al. (which could correspond to beta being 0).\n4. Referring to Figure 3, it appears that there is a high correlation between clean and robust accuracy. However, I am curious about the implications of using just clean NTK values for adversarial robust search and how that might affect the interpretation of the results.\n\n\nMinor Comments\n1. In Table 2, the entries in the first column are not center-aligned. This misalignment could be corrected for improved readability and a more professional presentation of the data.\n2. The interpretations of Figure 3, specifically parts (b) and (c), pose some difficulties. Enhanced specificity in the explanations accompanying these figures would greatly facilitate understanding."
