                "value": "This paper proposes an approach for selecting the best teacher (annotator) during the process of learning the reward function in a bandit-like setting. The characteristic feature of the setup is that several teachers are available with varying reliability but the same preferences. The authors introduce the problem of Hidden Utility Bandit where there is a choice between drawing an arm and querying the teacher about the utilities of the observations. The authors conduct experimental studies on paper recommendations application and on COVID-19 vaccine testing."

The goal of the paper is to model the reward learning setup with more realism and to remove the assumption of having a single teacher and it is an important goal. I find the observation about the fact that not the most reliable teacher would be selected all the time (because the odds of the selection from less reliable teachers allow us to estimate the difference in utilities) quite interesting and insightful."

                "value": "My main concern is about the applicability of the assumptions in the problem formulation to the real domains. When introducing HUB formalization, it would be useful to draw parallels with the real applications. This becomes more clear in the experimental studies, but then it seems to be a bit artificial. For example, it seems that there is an assumption that all the teachers have the same utility function (it would be useful if the paper stated all the assumptions of the introduced framework clearly, another one that is not stated clearly is that the space in which the reward is learnt is assumed to be discrete). I am not sure this assumption is suitable for the paper recommendation applications (section 4.1) as it means that everyone has the same preferences. Other examples: it seems that after asking for a preference in recommendation, one needs to wait for a day to propose an article, or the results of vaccine application are observed immediately etc. The studied setting sounds interesting, but so far I am not convinced that problem formulation fits the real applications well. I think in order to be more convincing, it might be useful to find another realistic application for the proposed method, or modify the assumptions of the method to fit the real world applications better.\n\nI think the related literature lacks the literature on selecting the annotators when annotating data for supervised learning in crowdsourcing and active learning (see some examples, but more can be easily found).\n\nF. Rodrigues, F. Pereira, and B. Ribeiro. Gaussian process classification and\nactive learning with multiple annotators.ICML, 2014.\n\nC. Long, G. Hua, and A. Kapoor.

In Advances in Neural\nInformation Processing Systems, 2017\n\n[BOOK] Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning: Active learning and annotation for human-centered AI 2021\n\nThe question of the related literature brings me to the next point. The authors claim that this new problem formulation lacks the baselines in the related literature. However, as the problem has a component of selecting the annotators for crowdsourcing annotation and bandit problem that maximizes the reward, a simple baseline could be to do it in two stages: 1) active teacher selection to learn the reward function, 2) bandit algorithm to maximize the sum of rewards. Would such a baseline be applicable?\n\nAfter reading the paper, I still have some questions related to the main method. What is the advantage of re-formulating the problem as POMDP (as it still has a single state as a bandit)? How does it relate to the contextual bandit algorithms? The NaiveHUBInference is described in many details, but the proposed method of the paper is very brief and lacks details. I would like to hear more about it. Is the policy learnt on the fly or some prior simulations are needed? \n\nSome minor questions:\n- for estimating \\beta the authors propose to use a dataset of preferences, however, if such a dataset is available, the reward might be learnt directly and used in the future.\n- Information in tables could be made a bit more readable (Figure 2 and 7)\n- RLHF term in the title is confusing. The focus of the paper is on rewards learning, and it could be better reflected in the title."

The paper does present two theories, yet these appear to be more of preliminary lemmas than comprehensive theoretical validations. A better analysis would entail a comparative study of the regret associated with the proposed algorithm against established benchmark methods, such as consistently relying on a single teacher. This comparative analysis would provide readers with a clearer understanding of the advantages and potential drawbacks of the proposed method.\n\n**Clarity and Notation**: The manuscript exhibits areas of ambiguity, marked by several instances of unclear notation and expressions, particularly in Sections 2 and 3. The abundance of notation can be overwhelming, detracting from the overall readability of the paper. A revision aimed at simplifying and clarifying these sections would enhance the manuscript's accessibility. Additionally, the HUB framework, a central component of the paper, is not adequately explained. The manuscript would greatly benefit from the inclusion of detailed examples illustrating the practical application of this framework. Providing clear, real-world scenarios that elucidate the concepts of 'arms' and 'items' within the context of the HUB framework would render the paper more informative and user-friendly.\n\n**POMDP Literature**: Given that the paper addresses the problem using POMDPs, it is imperative to include a thorough discussion of relevant POMDP literature. Incorporating references and discussions around works such as https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/boots-siddiqi-gordon-closing-loop-psrs.pdf, https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12484, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.13081.pdf, alongside an exploration of their relevance to the current study, would lend greater depth and context to the paper."
