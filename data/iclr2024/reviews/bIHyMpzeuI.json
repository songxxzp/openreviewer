It is unclear how sensitive the results will be with respect to $n$, and there are no guideline to select $n$. Looking at Algorithm 2, it seems like AEA employs a pre-training phase to decide $k_j$ for each modality independently. However, this does not take into account the interaction of multitask learning when the modalities are learned together. There are also no constraints to enforce that all experts are utilized, i.e. $\\sum_j k_j = N$. Lastly, in Figure 2-3, it is unclear why larger training-validation loss gap can lead to better generalization. When this gap is large, the model is either underfitted or overfitted rather than achieved better generalization. \n    + **ALP**: it is unclear what \"learning pace\" mean in this context, i.e. is it the learning rate or some components that directly influence the training trajectory?\n\n* Table 1 and 2 are quite unclear, what is the \"setting\" here referred to, is it the dataset size, or the model size? For example, in Table 2, SM$^4$ Medium - AV-MNIST has 1.23M params while the same method in the large setting has 0.76M params. The results of HighMMT seems to be quite different from the original, which requires further investigations.\n\n* Other suggestions: Figure 2 is not nice, please consider using subfigure, e.g. 2a, 2b, etc. instead of the current presentation."

This raises 2 concerns:\n* a. Without checking robustness, it is unclear if the trained model is robust to missing or noisy modalities, which shall be an important criterion in multimodal learning.\n* b. The trade-off between training cost and model performance of SM^4 is unclear. In particular, deciding number of experts for each modality seems to be time-consuming. I suppose checking the trade-off and comparing SM^4 with simple methods such as early/late can help measuring the practical value of this work more precisely.\n2. The reported performance of MultiBench models in Table 2 may be overly simplified. As the complexities of the MultiBench models greatly vary, simply reporting the aggregated performance (e.g., the range) makes it difficult to position SM^4 in this regard. Also, the dependencies between efficiency and performance are ignored, similar to the issue in weakness 1.b. A candidate method could be the 2D visualization adopted by MultiBench and is used for studying trade-offs.\n3. Minor typo: YR-FUNNY in Table 1."
