The authors cite that understanding these communities is essential for gut, industry and space but I find the step from this paper to extrapolating to gut seems huge. The largest studied communities are 26 and this needs to be put in context with the other fields, citing Wikipedia \u201c1010 to 1011 cells per gram of intestinal content\u201d seems far off from the estimated single colonies. The types of bacteria should also be matched with the environment that you aim to generalize for.\n* Sample Size & DNA Inclusion: I'm concerned about the limited independent samples, especially in combination with the attempt to include DNA. Making sense of DNA has proven much more difficult than thought of in the beginning and I\u2019m not convinced that the addition made sense. Adding it to the paper risks of overfitting the data even more. I wonder if the field wouldn\u2019t benefit more from going from 500 samples to 1-2000 more than this paper. My experience with building models on this type of data is that they are frustratingly brittle due to the lack of data.\n* Clarity & Explanation: Coming from medicin to ML is always a challenge. It would be helpful if the paper could provide clearer explanations for terms and metrics, especially for readers transitioning from medical backgrounds. E.g. keystone bacteria are not explained, good vs acceptable R2 is unclear to the reader (I can\u2019t even find clearly how is this calculated, despite looking in appendix A which I should not have to for the main outcome), I assume that R2 is highly dependent on the underlying complexity, also the datasets have completely different bacteria suggesting that their purpose was different but this is unclear to me despite reading it several times.\n* Simulation Impact: The paper should provide a clearer explanation of the effect of simulated colonies on the models' stability.\nRegarding the conclusion I\u2019m a little confused as to why it doesn\u2019t recommend including more data. I believe the authors have devoted significant time to this paper and before we put others down this path, perhaps we should wait for more data or do the authors truly feel that GEMs will be the solution?"

                "value": "1. The methodological contribution is limited as the presented work is mostly implementing GNNs for microbial steady state predictions. \n\n2. The main core of the paper is based on the assumption that if there is a steady state solution to the dynamics of bacterial species, then that steady state can be predicted using the genome data of the species in the system. This is a reasonable assumption to make. However the fact that this method works only for steady state solutions needs to be emphasized. Indeed in the GLV setting in the famous example of foxes and rabbits, there could be steady state and oscillatory solutions even though the participating genomes are foxes and rabbits in both the cases. It might also be a good idea to highlight why authors expect to find (or not) only steady state solutions in systems involving microorganisms such as bacteria. This will add more strength to the paper.\n\n3. For simulations, the GLV equations along with initial conditions and parameters $\\mu_i, K_i, a_{i,j}$ drawn from different probability density functions are used to generate data. Did all such simulations lead to steady state solutions? Were any simulations that did not lead to steady state solutions discarded? Do the authors also have any comments on the frequency of steady state solutions when random parameters are used?\n\n4. Given the GLV equations, the steady state solutions can be found by solving a system of $|S|$ linear algebraic equations:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\sum_{j=1}^{|S|}a_{i,j}n_j = K_i.\n    \\end{equation}\nThe steady state is entirely determined by the parameters $a_{i,j}$ and $K_i$. The authors use a vector composed of $[\\mu_i, K_i, \\nu_i^s, \\nu_i^r, random]$ (where $a_{i,j} \\approx \\nu_i^s. \\nu_j^r$) to simulate the genome data in their simulation. It would be a good idea to highlight that within the simulated genome vector only the components $[K_i, \\nu_i^s, \\nu_i^r]$ determine the steady state solution.\n\n5. The parameter $a_{i,j}$ (broken into two vectors $\\nu_i^s, \\nu_j^r$ to simulate the genome) contains information on the pairwise interaction between different species. On the other hand, the information in a genome is completely intrinsic to a particular species. The authors should square these two facts.\n\n6. A proper simulation would entail simulation of the genome data. The genome data typically do not include information on interaction between species. But for simulations, the interaction matrix was used to derive $\\nu$ vectors. The claim of interpretability seems to be questionable. \n    \n7. The authors appear to be confused on equivariance and invariance. The permutation invariance justification for using graph neural networks is confusing. For example, GLV models are widely used to model the dynamics of microorganisms. But the GLV model is not permutation invariant. The authors stated \"\\textit{When shuffling the order of bacteria within the train and test communities, the accuracy of MLPs drops significantly, clearly showing that the dynamics learned by MLPs are not invariant to permutations...}\" It is to be expected that shuffling the data will lead to reduction in performance of MLP based models. But as long as all the training and testing is done with a particular order of species, it should not matter.\n\n8. The authors need to provide details on how the node (genome) attributes were obtained, especially $\\nu$'s, as in real-world data, the ground-truth interaction $a_{ij}$ is not available."
