                "value": "This paper investigates the problem of solving a Nash equilibrium (NE) inside a normal-form general-sum game (NFG). Unlike previous works, the authors propose a new kind of loss that serves as an upper bound for $\\epsilon$ (coefficient of $\\epsilon$-Nash). More importantly, the authors show that an unbiased gradient of the loss can be obtained using the symmetrization technique. As a result, the problem of NE can be treated as a stochastic optimization problem, such that some famous algorithms like SGD and BLiN can exploited. Moreover, the authors also consider the case when the NE is not inside the simplex but on its boundary. And they show that this issue can be also handled by optimizing on a refined game with additional bonuses. Finally, empirical studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The solution is illuminated step by step, which is clear and intuitive. It is worth mentioning that the authors give several illustration figures (e.g., Figures 1 and 2) to help the readers understand the paper better, which is very good. The experiments are also sufficient and complete. Moreover, this work offers the community a new and principled way of solving NEs efficiently, and many more stochastic optimization algorithms can be leveraged in this field."
