This paper contributes with insights and results that show that calibration does also transfer from teacher to student, when the teacher is better calibration, and in other similar settings too.\n- The experimental setup seems correct, experiments are done on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 with state of the art convolutional networks with a good selection of calibration metrics. The selection of baselines is okay but I note in weaknesses that there are at least three papers that intersect with this work and are possible baselines.\n- Experimental results show that KDC with different calibration methods applied to the teacher network, does distill a calibrated student from the calibrated teacher network. This applies also to small teachers to large students, and iterative self-distillation. So there is evidence that the theoretical framework for linear networks also empirically extends into deep networks."

Calibration is measured through a reliability plot, and by comparing empirical confidences with empirical accuracies, I do not see this in the formulation in Equation 3, and its not clear why the previous definition for calibration would extend to Equation 3. From what I can interpret in this equation, it is summing the probabilities of the teacher and comparing them to the sum of the labels, which does not directly correspond to a zero calibration error. I would need clarification or further explanation here, specially as the whole proof is made starting from the formulation in Equation 3.\n\n- I am not sure of the novelty of this paper, there are several papers that explore knowledge distillation and calibrated teacher models:\n\nGuo H, Pasunuru R, Bansal M. An overview of uncertainty calibration for text classification and the role of distillation. InProceedings of the 6th Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP (RepL4NLP-2021) 2021 Aug (pp. 289-306).\n\nGurau C, Bewley A, Posner I.

InInternational Conference on Machine Learning 2016 Jun 11 (pp. 99-107). PMLR.\n\nThese papers all train teacher models with some uncertainty estimation method (MC-Dropout, Ensembles, etc), and then distill  the teacher model (which due to explicit uncertainty estimation methods, is better calibrated) into a student model without uncertainty that is also often better calibrated. While these papers do not use the same calibration methods for the teacher model, they do proof that calibration is transferred through knowledge distillation, which I believe is one of the major claims of this paper.\n\nI also note that these papers are not cited in the current version of this paper. I believe two things: these papers could be baselines, or from these papers it can be inferred that a calibrated teacher leads to a calibrated student model. This paper makes this exact claim, while the previous three papers I mention here, do not make that claim directly, but it is implied from their results. They basically say that distilling a teacher model with uncertainty estimation, will also transfer that uncertainty estimation to the student model, which is basically the same claim made in this paper.\n\nI believe that these three papers (there could be more) severely weaken the novelty of this paper.\n\nMinor Comments\n- If you could not experiment on Tiny ImageNet, then there is no point on mentioning this dataset in the experimental setup."

As the KD framework are usually studied in deep learning paradigm, the theoretic analysis based linear classifier is kind of weak for understanding KD in deep learning. Although the authors argue that the input of the linear classifiers can be the features extracted from deep backbones, this results still cannot fully explain why KD helps calibration since the representation learning in the KD framework is not considered in this paper. Furthermore, the miscalibration (over-confidence) issue is widely considered as a more challenge problem in deep models rather than linear models.\n\n2. The experimental setup is somewhat confusing. For the comparison methods like Mixup, AdaFocal, CPC and MDCA, their hyperparameters were used as recommended in their original papers. However, for the proposed method, it is unclear whether (setting 1) the hyperparameters for the teacher model were set identically with the baselines, or (setting 2) if they were tuned on the validation set to find the optimal parameters that minimized the calibration error. If setting 1 is adopted, it is not consistently with the motivation stated in this paper that the teacher model is well-calibrated, since it is clear that the calibration performance is not good as shown in the top rows in Table 2. If setting 2 is adopted, the comparison between the proposed method and the baselines (e.g., KD with Mixup vs Mixup) is not fair, since the hyperparameters of baselines are not optimized in terms of the calibration error.\n\n3. The statement of \"post-hoc methods are known to result in relatively inferior calibration performance\" is not well supported by the literature in calibration. For example, previous works [1][2][3] show the effectiveness of post-hoc calibration methods even compared with training-time calibration methods or the integration of training-time calibration methods and post-hoc calibration techniques. The results in Table 2 in this paper also show that simple CE+TS is better than many training-time calibration methods.\n\n[1] On calibration of modern deep neural networks, ICML 2017\n[2] On the pitfalls of mixup on uncertainty calibration, CVPR 2023\n[3] A benchmark study of calibration, Arxiv 2023"
