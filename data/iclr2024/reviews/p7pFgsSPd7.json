To achieve simplicity and effectiveness, this paper proposes a method named Sample-aware RandAugment, which dynamically adjusts the magnitude of augmentation operators according to the Magnitude Instructor Score (MIS). MIS shows the consistency between the prediction and the label, which is a heuristic metric to measure the difficulty of samples. Three steps will be adopted during training, including Distribution Exploration (adopting Rand Augmentation with uniformly sampled magnitudes), Sample Perception (measuring MIS), and Distribution Refinement (adopting Rand Augmentation with MIS). The authors conduct experiments on both CIFAR and ImageNet with different network architectures and show performance improvements compared to SOTA AutoDA methods."

For example, there is only a 0.2% improvement between the SRA and the reproduced RA with ResNet-50 and DeIT in ImageNet experiments.\n2. The proposed method highly depends on RandAugment. I consider the most important contribution of this paper to be the strategy of using MIS to adjust the magnitude of each sample. What about adopting the proposed strategy with other augmentation methods? For example, randomly choosing augmentation operators from a search space, and comparing the performances with and without the proposed method.\n3. What is the purpose of Step 1? Is it necessary to split the batch into two splits? (1) What about doing step 1 on the first batch and then doing steps 2 and 3 on the second batch? (2) What about removing step 1?"
