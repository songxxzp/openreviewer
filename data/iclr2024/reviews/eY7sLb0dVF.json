            "questions": {
                "value": "1. I know trying to optimizer both the prior and posterior in a loss function has become a trend in the deep learning community. However, theoretically speaking, trying to optimize the prior and posterior jointly in the KL loss leads to a ill-posed problem, where a unique solution does not exist. Simply put, it becomes a ping-pong game between the prior and posterior. You can easily show it by computing the parameters of the distributions in a local minima. How do you deal with this ill-posedness? \n\n2. What is $z_t$ and what is $y_t$? Are they different random variables? Based on the paper, it looks like both $y_t$ and $z_t$ denote the latent code, meaning that they are the same variable. I understand that the authors used $y_t$ and $z_t$ to distinguish between the prior and posterior latent code. But the way it is formulated now is not correct. For example, how do you define $KL[q(z)\\|p(y)]$ in eq. (3)? Shouldn't It be $KL[q(z)\\|p(z)]$ or $KL[q(y)\\|p(y)]$?\n\n3. What is the probabilistic model for $p(x_{1:t}|z_{1:t})$? Is it a parametric distribution, e.g., normal distribution? How do you compute the log likelihood function?\n\n4. If the modulus of the eigenvalues of $A$ is not strictly 1, i.e., $|\\lambda| =1$, the system either grows or decays exponentially fast. It should be a hard constraint, not a soft constraint. How do you guarantee this?\n\n5. Based on Eq (6), $y_t$ becomes deterministic once $y_{t-1}$ is observed. Then the probability distribution becomes a delta function, $p(y_t|y_{1:t}) = p(y_t|y_{t-1}) = \\delta (y_t - Ay_{t-1})$. How do you compute the KL divergence of the Dirac delta distribution?\n\n6. How do you find the correct initial condition $y_0$ to represent $x_{1:T}$. As discussed by the authors, $x_{1:T}$ is transformed to $y_{1:T}$. Then, since the model is linear, once $y_0$ is determined, the rest of the sequence is determined as $y_t = A^t y_0$. Hence, it is crucial to find $y_0$ that describes $x_{1:T}$ the best. How do you choose $y_0$ and how do you guarantee that the choice of $y_0$ is the optimal?"

As GRU can provide a nonlinear sequence-to-sequence transformation, it is unclear if the linear structure of $y_{1:T}$ was really beneficial when generating $x_{1:T}$. The results could be more convincing if the decoder did not have the GRU; instead, it should have had a nonlinear **pointwise** (i.e., not sequence-to-sequence) transformation such as a multilayer perceptron applied to each timestep independently. An ablation study with such a change of architecture would be highly informative.\n\n----\n\nBelow are minor points.\n\n- Why do you use two different letters, $y$ and $z$, for the prior part and the posterior part, respectively? Usually in VAE papers, the latent variable is always $z$, and we just say $p(\\cdot)$ for prior and $q(\\cdot)$ for posterior. The current notation in the paper might also be okay, but I just wondered if there could be particular intention to use the two letters.\n- Although the paper focuses on the generation capability of the models, some more experiments on the reconstruction / inference capablity could also be interesting."

In my understanding, the linearity of the dynamics of $y_{1:T}$ is not a hard constraint but rather is imposed in a soft manner as regularization.
