Additionally, the application of Spherical Gaussians (SGs) in the context of lighting is previously detailed in works like PhySG, suggesting the paper's approach is not entirely unprecedented.\n\n2. While the paper acknowledges PhySG, it does not sufficiently recognize the prior exploration of SGs for modeling incident light. A more explicit acknowledgment would strengthen the paper by correctly attributing the origins of this idea.\n\n3. The utilization of environment map-based lighting is a well-trodden area in research, evidenced by efforts like Nvidia\u2019s nvdiffrec-mc. The paper's critique of environment map-based lighting in favor of SGs may not be entirely justified, and the simplifications made in visibility reasoning warrant a closer examination. The unconventional modeling of the environment map using 128 Spherical Gaussians in this paper departs from traditional methods and calls into question the asserted superiority of SG over environment maps. Therefore, claims regarding the advantages of SG should be made with greater technical precision and careful comparison."

Successful results on this dataset would serve as a robust testament to the algorithm's capabilities.\n\n3. It is important for the paper to detail the distinctions between the environment map used in this study and that employed by Nvdiffrec, particularly since the paper touts the superiority of Spherical Gaussians (SG) over environment maps. A clear comparison would illustrate the specific contributions and advantages of the proposed method.\n\n4. For a more convincing demonstration of the algorithm\u2019s performance in handling complex lighting scenarios, the paper should present an experiment visualizing the incident light maps reconstructed using the shiny NeRF-synthetic dataset.

In the case of the geometrical volume, SDF values are directly stored in the grid structure. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that this representation leads to efficient inverse rendering and delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods."

Increasing the order of SH could potentially address this limitation. To provide a more compelling evaluation, it is advisable to ensure an equal number of parameters when comparing SG and SH representations.\n\n-Details missing: It is not mentioned clearly how the global illumination and self-occlusion are handled during relighting.

The true difference of the proposed method and previous works is the local illumination model that can accelerate the optimization. Therefore, I feel authors can emphasize this more. For example, the introduction gives me the impression that this method is faster because it uses a voxel-based scene representation, which has adapted by many previous work, but instead it probably makes more sense to emphasize the illumination model. \n\n2. Geometry reconstruction.\nI feel one experiment that is missing is the geometry quality, especially compared to TensoIR. While it is mentioned in section 4.2, it is difficult to tell the differences. I am curious how will different lighting representations impact the geometry quality, especially for the highly specular surfaces and concave regions?\n\n3. Reference.\nOne con-current work that can be discussed in the paper is the NeuralPBIR (Sun et al.), which accelerates the reconstruction process by precomputing visibility and GI from NeRF so that material reconstruction can be done through local optimization. The idea of avoiding expensive ray tracing is related, while I feel the local illumination model proposed here is more different from previous works.\n\n4. Missing details.\nOne details I did not find in the paper is after predicting the SG parameters, how will you render the appearance? Are you going to sample rays uniformly, with importance sampling or just compute the integral analytically? Please remind me if I miss this part in the paper.\n\n5. Extension of the method to handle volumetric object. \nOne potential extension of this work is that instead of computing per-ray SG parameters and the render the appearances, we can also consider use per-point SG parameters to compute the radiance at every point through rendering equation. In this way, we might be able to reconstruct fury objects, with some modifications of the BRDF model. Does it make sense to authors?"
