The authors propose a general definition, namely mirror reflection symmetry, which unifies common symmetries including rescaling, rotation, and permutation symmetry. They then prove that every mirror symmetry leads to a structured constraint, which becomes a favored solution when the weight decay or gradient noise is large. The theoretical framework is applied to explain various phenomena in gradient based learning and to suggest new algorithms that enforce constraints."

Its ability to unify the theory behind these phenomena demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach.\n\nThe writing is clear, and each theorem is accompanied by helpful and intuitive explanations."

However, the proof of theorem 1 assumes that $\\ell_0$ is twice differentiable, at least in the neighborhood of all points with $(u,w)=(0,0)$. \n\nDepending on the geometry of the loss function, $\\gamma$ that satisfies (21) may diverge close to (u,w)=(0,0). Hence, while Theorem 1 part 2 can be interpreted as locally favoring solutions (u,w)=(0,0), the required regularization strength can be too large to make this interpretation meaningful. Part 2 of theorem 2 and 3 have the same issue.\n\nSome derivations in the main text skip steps, which makes it hard to follow for readers less familiar with related work. For example, it would be helpful to include some background information or reference for the escape rate of SGD in the third paragraph on page 7. In the following paragraph, the assumption that $H(x)$ commutes with $H(x\u2019)$ might need a justification.\n\nWhile the theory is successful in explaining various known phenomenon in training, there is limited evidence of its potential in guiding practices. Including some applications, such as experiments to back up the effectiveness of the algorithm in Section 4.6, could make the value of the theory more convincing."

The theory disentangles the effects of symmetries from weight decay and other regularization techniques on the loss landscape, which could enable new avenues of attack on controlling the minima that training converges to."

                "value": "My main concern is that the relevance of the work could be made explicit, as at first glance it seems to restate obvious results (such as that zeroed weights remain zero throughout training). In particular it would be nice to get a summary of how changes to weight decay, learning rate, and the amount of mirror symmetries affect empirical outcomes, such as more weight decay = more likely to fall into symmetry-induced stationary conditions.\n\nIn section 4.4, I don't believe this theory should take credit for the solution of adding random gradient noise, since it seems a trivial way to eliminate all stationary conditions regardless of whether they are caused by symmetry or not (the random bias method is more relevant). In general the connections in 4.4 require more work and empirical evidence in order to understand which are caused by symmetry and which are not. Overall, the main implications of this paper could be hammered out more strongly, while less central ideas like relating collapse to \"phase transitions\" and the DCS algorithm could be cut or left as a mention in the discussion.\n\nMinor problems:\n- Some details/notations could be explained more thoroughly, such as: define \"structured constraint\" when it is introduced, what is $R$ referring to in (3), same symbol $O$ is used for both mirror and order in (8), definition of $\\lambda$ versus $\\eta$ in (9).\n- The statement \"Notably, Entezari et al. (2021) empirically showed that neural networks under SGD\nlikely converge to the same type of solution if we take permutation symmetry into consideration\" isn't quite right, as Entezari conjectures this and follow-up work Ainsworth et al. shows something weaker (linear connectivity between pairs of solutions)."

How does this method eliminate the structured constraints such as in figure 3?"
