The proposed framework, RaLMSpec, leverages the temporal locality of the retrieved documents and uses a caching-based speculative retrieval mechanism with bached verification to reduce the latency in the retrieval phase. Based on this, three techniques are proposed to further speed up the process, i.e., top-k cache update, asynchronous verification, and optimal speculation stride scheduler. Experiments are conducted on various datasets, language models, and retrievers and RaLMSpec is proven to be effective."

Caching-based speculative retrieval mechanism and prefetching: RaLMSpec leverages the temporal locality of retrieved documents to enable a request-level local cache for speculative retrieval.  RaLMSpec prefetches the cache to reduce the latency of the first retrieval.\n\n2. Batched and asynchronous verification: RaLMSpec uses a batched verification step to guarantee correctness while reducing the retrieval overhead. This is done asynchronously to overlap the verification with the retrieval and further boost the speculation performance.\n\n3. Optimal speculation stride scheduling: RaLMSpec schedules the speculation stride optimally to balance the trade-off between speed and accuracy."

                "value": "I am primarily concerned about the significance of this work.\n\nFirstly, I am unsure about the practicality of iterative RAG. From my understanding, current AI-powered search engines like Bing Chat do not operate iteratively. Instead, they perform retrieval all at once and then apply RAG. These systems typically have a cache system that stores the results of common queries, thereby saving the cost of performing retrieval for each query. The only difference between this paper and these common practices is the iterative RAG setting. However, I am still concerned about this iterative setting, as I am uncertain whether the benefits are significant enough, especially for LLMs.\n\nSecondly, as far as I understand, the main cost of the RAG model lies in the generation aspect. For mature search engines, various optimizations of the retrieval part are already well-established, fast, and efficient. However, generation has always been the more costly part. Therefore, I am unsure whether the speedup improvement reported by the authors refers to the savings in the retrieval part or the end-to-end savings. If it is the latter, I would like to know how much improvement this technology could bring when applied to a mature search engine.\n\nSome minor issues:\n\n- A comparison between iterative RAG and conventional RAG should be presented to demonstrate the value of iterative RAG, as it may introduce more latency.\n\n- The LLMs used in the experiments are small. This makes the retrieval speed improvement appear greater in the end-to-end latency improvement. However, when the LLM becomes larger, the end-to-end speed improvement will become very marginal.\n\n- There are previous related studies (e.g., [1]) that explore the idea of speculation and cache in the RAG setting. The authors should include these as related work, while they focus more on the generation speedup.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Yang et al.: Inference with Reference: Lossless Acceleration of Large Language Models. https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04487"
