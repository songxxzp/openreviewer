This corresponds to 1) performing ASR corresponding to the first 3-second audio segment and 2) predicting the rest of the sentence conditioned by the first 3-second audio segment and its transcriptions, corresponding to the language modeling task if we ignore the first 3-second audio segment. Note that the actual implementation does not require the split in the text part. The second task is to perform the speech continuation task of the rest of the audio segment conditioned on the first 3-second audio segment and previously estimated sentence. Thus, this training scheme holds ASR, text continuation, and speech continuation tasks with a single training framework with the standard paired speech utterances. This model is built upon various speech and text pre-trained models and is fine-tuned with the public speech database based on Libri-Light. The paper also has multiple comparisons with the other methods for speech continuation and spoken QA tasks and shows the superiority of the proposed method."

I appreciate your efforts in mitigating the issue (e.g., the use of Libriright and the release of the SQA test set), but I think the paper still has this issue.\n- Due to the above issue, it is not clear whether the superiority of the proposed method compared with other speech LMs comes from their novel training schemes or strong pre-trained models. Thus, the effectiveness, especially for the comparisons with other speech LMs, is weak.\n- Clarity: Section 2 requires more improvements.

Would it robustly work even if we throw more than (or less than) 3-second spoken prompts?\n- Similarly, how did you deal with sentences that are less than 3 seconds during training? Can you discard them or concatenate neighboring sentences to make it longer than 3 seconds?\n- How about combining multiple sentences and using the original first sentence as a chunk instead of a 3-second chunk? In this case, we would also have access to the transcription corresponding to the spoken prompt part easily. We can have more precise control of the text output to perform ASR inside the framework explicitly.\n- Around equation (3), $\\mathcal{P}_s$: why does $\\mathcal{P}_s$ depend on position $s$?\n- In section 4.1, the last sentence, \"For semantic and acoustic quality, Spectron was trained with a model of 350 million parameters, while for the question answering task, Spectron was trained with a model of 1 billion parameters,\" I could not understand it.
