Most of the merits of the proposed methods (e.g., better forward dynamics, learn asymmetric reconstruction to handle uninformative reward) seems to come from the MLR backbone.\n\n3.

However, the justification for how the proposed ReBis method successfully overcomes these challenges remains unconvincing. The paper's method of using block-wise masking observation to simulate the sampling of stochastic dynamics is not fully explained. Various other techniques, such as random cropping as in DrQ, employing Dropout layers, or introducing noise to weights or latent features, could potentially serve a similar purpose. A detailed comparison of these methods within the experimental section would be beneficial for substantiating the need for block-wise masking.\nRegarding the challenge of sparse rewards, the explanation of how ReBis overcome this issue is not adequately addressed. The paper should provide a clearer rationale for why its methods would be more effective in such environments.\n\nThe paper\u2019s claim to novelty largely rests on the application of a transformer dynamics model, but this alone does not present a compelling case for novelty. The absence of a thorough comparative analysis, especially in the ablation studies, against non-transformer or non-sequential architectures, diminishes the strength of the argument for the proposed method\u2019s innovation. Furthermore, the paper borrows heavily from prior work for various aspects, such as the masked observation approach, the metric used, and the theoretical framework, which detracts from the original contribution.\n\nThe theoretical foundation of the paper also shows weaknesses. \n1. The Definition 1 provided is mislabeled as \"bisimulation-based\" since it lacks the Wasserstein distance. It defines metric like MICo or SimSR but misses an expectation operator in front of $\\bar{d}$. \n1. Theorem 2 and 3 for bisimulation metric, originated from (Kemertas & Aumentado-Armstrong, 2021), cannot be directly applied to the metric defined in the paper because their proofs rely on the Wasserstein distance, which is absent from the paper's metric. The authors need to develop new proofs that are pertinent to their specific metric definition.\n1. Theorem 4 does not seem intuitive if the metric includes an expectation operator. (Castro et al., 2021) mentioned it is \u0141ukaszyk\u2013Karmowski distance with non-zero distance. The transition from Equation (15) to Equation (16) in the proof is unclear and requires further clarification."
