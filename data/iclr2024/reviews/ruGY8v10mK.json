Saying this, I mean that we cannot use the approach in semi-supervised scenario, when objects without labels are available. We still need to know labels.\n3. The confusion matrix in Figure 1, as I understood, was computed using the validation data. Shouldn't it be more fair to build it on test set?\n4. In scenarios where there's a very good classifier and a high-quality dataset (like MNIST or CIFAR10, with low aleatoric uncertainty), there might be a significant imbalance between positive and negative samples. This could lead to the situation that the trained uncertainty measure is unreliable. How should one address this situation?"

There has been some work in the literature (although around OOD detection) that looks at using latent representations from deep neural network backbone and training models that use them (see for e.g. [1]). I see that you have taken a slightly different approach here that looks at using closed form solution, but the idea seems very similar. Can you describe how your paper differentiates from this high-level approach of taking features from a deep net backbone and then applying some transformation to it to generate an uncertainty metric? \n\n- Building upon the prev point, would it make a lot of difference if you were to use a simple MLP architecture rather than the closed form solution you have right now to transform the soft outputs into an uncertainty measure that's being fine-tuned on held-out tuning set? The MLP can also be trained on held-out tuning set. \n\n- How do you think your approach compares with Bayesian neural networks which also introduce other forms of uncertainty such as model uncertainty?
