The scale and type of data (including RAW images) suggest that significant effort has been invested in creating the dataset. While the paper primarily focuses on synthetic data for machine learning, the inclusion of other labels in the dataset can make it useful for other tasks (like the ones mentioned in the paper-superresolution, 3D reconstruction, and generative modeling). Exactly how it can be used for these tasks is not explained.\n2. Quality: I like how the paper systematically explores the effect of variations on the segmentation accuracy (/mIoU). This rigorous analysis of the effects of data variation can lead to some interesting insights but I'm not sure of how much practical use these are.\n3. Clarity: The introduction gives a good overview of the main contributions of the paper: the proposal of a new dataset and an exploration of the synthetic to real performance gap, and the importance of research in synthetic data generation. The description of the problem and the dataset is quite clear and easy to follow. I also appreciate the fact that the paper acknowledges is clear about its limitations, particularly that the gap between synthetic and real data still remains unexplained.\n4. Significance: The dataset, as described, is positioned as a benchmark that could aid other researchers in studying the sim-to-real problem, and I acknowledge that benchmarks have been vital in advancing ML research."

                "value": "### Weaknesses\n\n1. Experiments:\nA main motivation for the dataset is that it can help to address the gap between synthetic and real data, however the paper doesn't really show how the dataset can be used to explain why this gap exists. I would suggest that the authors dive deeper into potential reasons for this gap. Are there features or nuances of real-world images that the synthetic data does not capture (perhaps gradient attribution or some other attribution method can be used to explore this).\n2. Originality and contribution:\nWhile the paper briefly mentions competing datasets, it doesn't give a clear comparison between these. Understanding how this work differentiates or improves upon existing dataset is crucial for assessing its novelty and significance. There are many synthetic and real dataset on useful real-world domains such as street scenes for autonomous driving (eg. CARLA/SynthIA/GTA5 vs KITTI/cityscapes). A dedicated section comparing the new dataset and procedural model to existing ones in terms of size, quality, versatility, and applications would enhance the paper's depth and relevance.\n3. Lack of demonstrating broader applications:\nThe paper loosely mentions applications like superresolution, 3D reconstruction, and generative modeling but does not provide experiments or detailed insights into how the dataset enhances these applications. Detailed experiments or use-cases showing the effectiveness of the dataset in these applications would give readers a tangible understanding of its real-world significance.\n4. Addressing the sim-to-real gap:\nThe authors emphasize the need to understand critical differences between real and synthetic data, but no conclusive insights are drawn about this using the dataset. A dedicated analysis or experiment that can help to highlight and understand the differences between the domains would add substantial depth to the paper."

            "questions": {
                "value": "### Specific questions:\n\n1. From the experiments in the paper it seems it's quite difficult to draw conclusions as to what is leading to the synthetic to real gap. Do you believe the dataset can actually be used to draw such insights and how do you think this could be done?\n2. The dataset seems to be a completely \"toy\" domain that might also be quite expensive to train. I would therefore be a bit concerned about researchers wasting hours of compute (with corresponding environmental impact) on models that aren't useful for any other tasks. How would the authors address this?"

                "value": "[1] Limited contribution. The proposal of a new dataset including both synthetic and real data is always appreciated; however, the paper does not fully justify its significance over other existing datasets. For instance, with respect to the application of segmentation, there are a wide range of datasets especially on city scenes or driving scenes that have been extensively utilized for the task and even in the context of domain adaptation. In this paper the choice of windows as the domain is properly justified, but it did not answer the question on whether existing datasets can already serve the same purpose (or more). In this case, the significance of the dataset is in question.\n\n[2] Limited evaluation. The paper evaluates the proposed dataset in segmentation tasks on various settings. However a missed opportunity given the availability of both real and simulated splits and the discovery of domain gap in its evaluation, is to test the dataset on domain adaptation methods. The paper could have tested the dataset with existing domain adaptation methods on what the baseline benchmark looks like, potential advantage or challenges of the dataset when compared to other existing datasets in the context of domain adaptation. Otherwise it is difficult to evaluate the impact of the proposed dataset on domain adaptation research, without including actual evaluation results.\n\n[3] Writing. The paper includes lengthy introduction and justification of the choice of windows, in the Introduction section. The text mostly served its purpose. However the writing can be greatly improved. For instance, reorganizing the first paragraph of the Introduction section from 6 points into an organic flow of arguments can be made: the main task the dataset is motivated towards, issues with existing datasets, features of the proposed dataset which significantly differentiates itself from existing ones, and other major features of the proposed dataset. Additionally, the 6 points can overlap: 1st and 4th points both talk about why choosing the domain of windows, and also overlaps with the entirety of the second paragraph. The 6th point is confusing: any dataset comprised of images can be used to extract image features. Finally, additional introduction of Wood et al. before referring to it may benefit the readers in better understanding the last paragraph of the Related Works section and Label Adaptation of Section 6."
