The paper primarily targets the limited expressiveness of the existing PEFT methods and proposes a new adaptation scheme for increasing the expressiveness. The proposed fine-tuning strategy can be summarized as follows 1) For a pretrained model, low dimensional subspaces are obtained using SVD computation, 2) the optimization subspace is selected randomly, and the model is updated over the selected subspace for arbitrary iterations, 3) Further the pretrained model weights are again updated with the new weight approximations and new optimization subspace is again selected by considering random orthogonal subspaces obtained via SVD. The paper further shows that the proposed fine-tuning strategy is capable of fine-tuning pretrained weights to arbitrary target weights, making them as expressive as full-finetuning. \n\nApart from theoretical analysis, the paper provides a detailed set of experiments over widely used Natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. The empirical results show a performance comparison with other PEFT approaches as well as the fine-tuned version of the model, highlighting the performance obtained by the proposed fine-tuning strategy to perform comparable/better to the full finetuning of the pretrained model."

The primary components are the SVD initialization, orthogonality, and resampling. The paper also reports the ablation results, making the components justified and the study reliable for future research. \n* The paper clearly talks about the limitations of the proposed method, which include the storage requirement of keeping the entire model after adaptation over a domain. The primary advantage of the proposed scheme is the reduction in memory usage during training, making the models trainable with limited GPU memory with the added limitation of being usefull for only a single downstream task."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* Since the entire model parameters are updated, it becomes crucial to consider a comparison with the full fine-tuning training strategy. If the convergence speed of the full-finetuning is not improved or comparable, the primary advantage of ROSA only relies on low memory usage for finetuning, which can also be achieved by other means like model sharding for faster training with a number of GPUs. \n\n* The paper compares the training time of one epoch of fine-tuning in Table 1, where the Epoch time of full finetuning, as reported, is ~157 seconds. When comparing with the proposed method, the Epoch time + Factorize Time also results in a similar time of ~153 seconds + 4 seconds, since at every epoch, a ROSA factorization step is performed, the overall finetuning time of the proposed method and the finetuning of the entire model is similar. If the convergence speed of the proposed method is similar (or lower) to finetuning, the primary motivation of PEFT approaches (less training time) turns out to be missing. I am not sure if I am missing something; however, if the entire model is updated (not keeping the source knowledge intact in terms of pretrained model parameters as done in other adapter-based approaches), the proposed method results in the same model performance as finetuning with no advantage of PEFT approaches. Moreover, as highlighted by the authors, this also limits the usage of the proposed technique for multi-task/domain adaptation."

More detailed discussion on similar lines would help understand the proposed method better. \n\n* A detailed analysis of the convergence rate with various PEFT methods, along with the full finetuning, would be required to obtain a transparent picture of the proposed PEFT technique. It would be interesting to observe if the proposed scheme helps converge with less variability and low sensitivity. \n\nMinor suggestions:\n* In Figure 2, it would be good to make a comparison with full-finetuning, highlighting the comparison between the rate of convergence."

This paper provides a more solid theoretical analysis and compares ROSA with LoRA on a few NLU and NLG tasks. However, improvements do not appear to be significant.\n\n2. I think more experiments are needed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. (1) I'm not very clear about the task selections in the experiment section.  For example, the QQP task is missing in GLUE tasks. Ablation studies are performed in two different tasks (CoLA and MRPC). In my opinion, both tasks use a small training set and the results always fluctuate a lot. (2) PEFT methods are always used for large models. It is necessary to check the performance of large models. (3) LoRA is particularly useful for image generation tasks such as SD models. Would you do more experiments in computer vision tasks?\n\n3. As discussed in the limitation section, LoRA can be released as a plunge into using very large models. It provides great flexibility in the use and distribution of models. Therefore, ROSA's practicability is weaker than LoRA, which will limit the contribution of this work.\n\n[1] Gamal, Marawan, and Guillaume Rabusseau. \"ROSA: Random Orthogonal Subspace Adaptation.\" Workshop on Efficient Systems for Foundation Models@ ICML2023. 2023."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. I do not quite understand of the limitation 2 of LoRA. The authors claim that \"Second, initializing the adapter AB to zero can be thought of as learning new representations from scratch separately from the pre-trained ones (\u03c6(x) = Wx + ABx:= \u03c6pre-trained(x) + \u03c6trainable(x)), rather than leveraging the pre-trained features the model already has to initialize the adapter.\" \n\nFrom my personal point of view, this design element is a boon rather than a limitation. It allows fine-tuning to start precisely from the pre-trained checkpoint, thus safeguarding the integrity of the pre-trained model. In the ROSA context, users do not need to initiate new parameters, as they can start training directly from the pre-trained checkpoint. Both methods are trained using pre-trained checkpoints. Therefore, I would not consider it a LoRA limitation. What are your thoughts?\n\n2. A question about synthetic data experiments. As we know, LoRA is a method for finetuning, which means that the basic model is well-pre-trained. It assumes that the fine-ting tasks or domain adaptations can be achieved with a low-rank tuning. So I'm a bit confused about the synthetic data experiment. It can be shown that in some cases LoRA can not be optimized well. However, this is not the typical application of methods like LoRA."
