This result can easily follow from existing ones using the chain rule of mutual information, by also making the worst-case correlation assumption. \n\n2. There appear to be technical errors/misunderstandings on some concepts. One particularly troublesome one is around Theorem 4.5. Since h(U^{(T)}|W_0,S_n) is a differential entropy, instead of entropy (i.e., continuous random variables instead of discrete random variables), there is little meaning in its absolute value or its sign, since a simple scaling of the continuous random variable can change the differential entropy value by any amount. The authors appear to misunderstand this difference, and Theorem 4.5 is in a sense meaningless in this form. \n\n3. The comparisons do not appear convincing. The authors made a different assumption and therefore obtained different bounds. It would appear unfair to argue that the derived bound is tighter than others, as claimed in Section 5."
