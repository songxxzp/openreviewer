The proposed solution is derived from Self-Expressive Models (SEM). The representations or so-called signatures in the paper are learned by imposing  the reconstruction to use only data points that lie in the same low dimensional subspace. This way can guarantee the solutions are within some confined space. In addition, the paper states that the proposed method is robust and also can capture meaningful relationships. Experimental results showed that the proposed SMF product comparable or better prediction results than other existing NMF or SEM methods."

The paper has some good intuitions, and the idea of introducing the Self Expressiveness on the W matrix subspace is interesting. However, we don't have any theoretical guarantees that this is going to work in general. I would accept intuition as a guidance, but:\n- NMF suffers from local minima, and this needs to be studied extensively, even empirically\n- The number of experiments is too small to get some significant guarantees. We need a much bigger pool of benchmarks\n- Scalability is another issue not examined. This is strongly tied to runtimes and convergence steps needed"
