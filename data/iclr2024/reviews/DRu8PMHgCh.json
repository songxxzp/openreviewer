In order to mitigate this degradation, the paper proposes a client selection policy based on  FedTrans, a Bayesian framework for client utility estimation. The paper constructs a probabilistic graphic model determining the relationship between the client utility, the round reputation matrix, the round informativeness, and some other parameters of the problem (e.g., clients models weights, discriminator model weights, and prior distributions parameters). The paper uses Variational Expectation Maximization to infer the parameters of this probabilistic graphical model. Finally, the paper conducts numerical experiments on FEMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with different types and levels of noise. The numerical experiments lead to the following conclusions: 1) FedTrans outperforms other methods. 2) Other methods cannot take advantage for small auxiliary dataset, as opposed to FedTrans. 3) Combining both the round-reputation matrix and the discriminator model is crucial for FedTrans to achieve good performance. 4) The performance of FedTrans is robust to variation in the size of the auxiliary dataset, however, the performance drops if the auxiliary dataset is scarce."

It raises the question of why the paper opts not to employ $x_{i, j}$ instead.\n    - Further clarification is needed to justify (5).\n- I am surprised by the drop of DivFL and FedCorr after 2the fine-tuning. My guess is that the fine-tuning employed a large learning rate, or a large number of epochs. \n- Figure 6 highlights a limitation of the proposed method: relying solely on the round-reputation or the discriminator model results in inferior performance compared to alternative methods. It is plausible that the superior performance of FedTrans stems from its stacking of two learning methods.\n- The evaluation criteria is unclear. Are the reported results evaluated only on \"good\" (i.e., mot noisy) clients, or on all the clients. \n- Similar to most robust federated learning approaches, FedTrans might raise fairness concerns, as it may eliminate benign clients from the training if their local data distribution is very different from the majority of clients. \n- Other minor issues: \n    - The conclusions of Figure 1 might be due to a poor choice of the learning rate. \n    - I am not sure that Figure 1 brings any significant value to the paper. My understanding is that the main conclusion obtained from Figure is that it is important to select reliable clients for training the global model. This conclusion is obvious. \n    - In the first sentence in Section 1; lives -> live.\n    - what is the meaning of \"without loss of generality\" in Section 1. Does it mean that the same results hold if we vary the flip rate? \n    - As opposed to the paper claim, I think that the calibration/computation of the weights $p_j$ in (1) is crucial. Please, note that $p_j$ in (1) is different from $p_j$ used in Appendix B.\n    - I think that $\\Theta$ is missing in the probabilistic graphical model depicted in Figure 3."
