                "value": "This work introduces a novel zero-shot NAS method, called as weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), designed to efficiently explore lightweight language models within a teacher-student network for knowledge distillation. The method harnesses the parameter counts and principal component analysis (PCA) values of the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer, instead of relying on gradient metrics, to offer a comprehensive and impartial evaluation. In experimental trials, this approach demonstrates the ability to significantly reduce training time when compared to previous one-shot NAS methods."

Combining these two aspects, w-PCA shows significantly smaller training time compared to 1-shot NAS, while achieving higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous SOTA training-based methods."
