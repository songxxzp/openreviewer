            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My biggest concern is that many claims in the submission are not very sound, and the proposed method is not sufficiently justified either theoretically or empirically. After reading the manuscript, I am not convinced at all that DuRM could really improve over ERM, except that it provides more hyperparameters so increases the degree of freedom for hyperparameter tuning. Thus, I recommend rejecting this submission.\n\nHere are my detailed comments:\n### 1. Regarding the usage of the term \"generalization\"\nIn ML there are two types of generalization, and I am not quite sure which one of them this work is talking about. The first type is train-to-test generalization, that is whether a model trained on the train set can perform well on the test set from the same distribution. The second type is OOD generalization, that is whether a model trained on one domain or distribution can perform well on another one. The introduction of this submission seems to focus on OOD generalization, yet the experiments also include standard classification tasks and segmentation tasks. Thus, I am not sure which generalization the authors want to claim that their method could improve. But either way, after reading the submission, I really cannot see how DuRM could improve either type of generalization.\n\n### 2. How the proposed DuRM method is implemented is not very clear\nFirst, I think Eqn. (2) is incorrect: The second $h_{erm}$ should be $h_{durm}$. Second, I couldn't find in the submission how this $h_{durm}$ is implemented, and there is no code attached. I assume that the authors add extra linear heads to the last linear layer for the dummy classes. Please let me know whether this is correct.\n\n### 3. Regarding Section 2.2 about gradient regularization\nThe whole Section 2.2 is very confusing, and does not seem very sound:\n- \"No samples are classified into dummy classes\": I guess the intuition here is that since no training sample belongs to the dummy classes, their weights will either converge to zero, or if used with softmax converge to a very negative point. But is it really true that absolutely not samples could be classified into the dummy classes? Not even under adversarial attack? For example, what would happen if one adversarial attacks a sample towards a dummy class? I cannot really see how Eqn. (3) could justify this claim.\n- \"Gradients with greater variance\": This part is even more confusing. \n  - First question: Variance over what? Where does the randomness come from? If the model is fixed, and the data points are fixed, then the gradient is fixed. Does the randomness come from the random initialization of the model, the stochasticity in SGD, or perhaps label noise? \n  - Second, why is it reasonable to assume that the gradients, if they are random, follow a Gaussian distribution that does not depend on time $t$? In some cases the Gaussian assumption could be reasonable, for example in Gaussian process NTKs. But why are they fixed throughout training? In Eqn. (4), none of $\\mu_{c_n}, \\sigma_{c_n}, \\mu_{c_p}, \\sigma_{c_p}$ depends on the training time (iteration) $t$. This makes zero sense to me.\n  - Third, why is it reasonable to assume that $g_d$ is independent of $g_c$? This is required for proving Theorem 1, which uses $D(\\hat{g}_c) = D(g_c) + D(g_d) + $ something else. If DuRM is implemented by adding additional linear heads on top of a shared backbone, then how could these two gradients be independent?\n- Finally, I guess one very important thing is that $h_{durm}$ cannot be initialized as zero, in which case its gradient will always be zero and will never be updated (assuming that the loss function is mean squared error, for instance). \n\n### 4. Regarding Section 2.3 about generalization analysis\nFirst of all, which \"generalization\" is this section talking about? Second, I don't think this section is talking about generalization at all. This section only says that DuRM will lead to flatter local minima, but even if it is true, this does not 100% imply that the generalization would be better. Flatter minima leading to better generalization is more like a conjecture in the implicit bias community, and indeed there is some theoretical and empirical work that showed that flatter minima do improve generalization under some specific settings. But this link is not 100%. There is also prior work that shows that flatter minima do not improve generalization, such as [1]. \n\nMoreover, I cannot see how Theorem 2 could prove that DuRM leads to flatter minima. And again, this result assumes that the gradients are sampled from fixed Gaussian distributions throughout $T$ steps of training, which is not reasonable.\n\n\n### 5. Regarding the experiments\nFirst, from Table 1, I really cannot see the superiority of DuRM. And neither of Table 5 and Table 6 is compared to any SOTA method. Like I said, I feel that the only reason why DuRM could be marginally better than ERM is that it gives more degree of freedom for hyperparameter tuning. It might be true that DuRM also provides some weight-decay-like implicit regularization effect, but we can also use better optimization algorithms such as momentum SGD, Adam, or weight decay in ERM, to achieve the same effect. Thus, in my opinion, the experiments do not sufficiently justify using DuRM.\n\n[1] Wen et al., Sharpness Minimization Algorithms Do Not Only Minimize Sharpness To Achieve Better Generalization, arXiv:2307.11007."

If the dummy class is included for the prediction normalisation, it works like a temperature to control the training dynamic.\n2. In Eq.8, the author claims if Eq.8 is satisfied DuRM can jump out of the local minimum described in Eq.7. However, it is the general case in the scholastic optimisation and it does not mean with a large gradient, jumping out of the current local minimum will end up in a better minimum. It is not clear to me how the large variance leads more flat loss region due to the reason that a large variance produces a small gradient at T. \n3. By reading [2], I cannot find a similar method to empirically evaluate the local flatness of the converged point used in the submission. Usually, the eigenvalue analysis is used instead. Also when in the flat region, the gradient should be small. Can the author explain more about the empirical evidence to flat local minima? Also [2] claims the gradient directions matter and that each gradient contributes to the whole measurement. \n\n[1] Liu Z, Xu Z, Jin J, Shen Z, Darrell T.
