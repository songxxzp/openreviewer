The paper aims to provide an automated pipeline for this selection problem. Following recent works, sample quality is evaluated on three dimensions: complexity, quality, and diversity where this evaluation is conducted by other LMs such as GPT-4. The paper validates the proposed approach with LLaMA-1 and shows that when selecting samples from a larger pool of lower-quality data, the proposed method, DEITA (Data-Efficient Instruction Tuning for Alignment), is able to match the performance of current open-source alignment models with a small fraction of fine-tuning data."

The topic is trendy but the approach is not technically challenging or particularly innovative.\n\nI have recently read a number of papers on this topic of instruction mining with LLaMA/Alpaca\u2013to name a few\n\n- a. ALPAGASUS : TRAINING A BETTER ALPACA WITH FEWER DATA\n- b. Instruction Mining: High-Quality Instruction Data Selection for Large Language Models\n- c. InstructionGPT-4: A 200-Instruction Paradigm for Fine-Tuning MiniGPT-4 \n\nThe technical body of these papers are uncomfortably similar. Combining a number of existing metrics (often in trivial ways) such as quality, diversity, etc. as a new evaluation metric and conducting the evaluations largely with the help of GPTs. And the end goals are also the same\u2013to achieve comparable or better performance with fewer samples. I'm not sure how much \"research gap\" remains there and how individual works may continue to contribute to that\u2013at least, this concern is still not resolved by this paper.\n\nIn terms of quality, the construction of this paper is simple. It does not have many ablation studies or insightful discussions of design choices/novel findings. No additional results or further discussions are provided in the Appendix.\n\nIt is an \"okay\" paper without much particular. Given its position in this apparently overly populated track, I would not be very interested in seeing it at the conference and vote against publishing it.\n\n- Reproducibility: Code, data, model checkpoints, or data selection tools are not provided during the reviewing phase.\n\n- Format: Appendix is not cut from the main paper.

If its extent of innovation is capped by the many other papers out there,  this work needs to have a high quality to be a valid contribution. This includes conducting more experiments and ablation studies and discussing design choices and novel findings.\n\n3. improve the technical approach. The current methods documented in this paper do not seem particularly novel compared to existing works and its technical contributions seem capped by the heavy reliance on GPTs. If the authors could design original technical approaches (new metrics, new evaluation methods, novel ways for combining different metrics), the paper could be made much more attractive.\n\n- Appendix should not be submitted under the main paper."

For quantifying complexity and quality, a dataset is collected for each of the two aspects by prompting ChatGPT in the following way: a seed set of samples are taken from the original dataset, ChatGPT is prompted to iteratively improve the complexity or quality of each of those samples along relevant dimensions, ChatGPT is then asked to score these samples for complexity or quality, a separate model (Llama-7B) is trained to predict these scores and then used to score the entire instruction tuning dataset. For diversity, the selected pool (initialized to be empty) is iteratively grown by adding points only if they are beyond a certain distance to their nearest neighbors already in the pool.\n\nThe data selection procedure sorts the existing dataset by the product of quality and complexity scores, and uses the diversity based selection procedure to select the points from the sorted set to a prespecified size.\n\nThe algorithm is evaluated by comparing Llama-13B models trained using the data selection procedure against existing instruction tuned models (trained on other datasets), and random selection baselines (trained on the same datasets of the same sizes with points selected randomly). Comparisons are made in terms of AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, where GPT-4 evaluates the responses and human evaluation on a sample of 100 requests from LIMA's test set. The algorithm outperforms random selection, and also other instruction tuned models based on Llama-1 trained on more data."

Since these are relatively small evaluation sets and it has been shown that GPT-4 evaluation can be biased (Wang et al., 2023; https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04751), one wonders if the data selection does better than random only because it is aligned with those biases. Including further evaluation, possibly on targeted benchmarks covering abilities like reading comprehension, complex reasoning etc. can be helpful.\n- Related to the above point, since human evaluation was done on only 100 instances, it would be helpful to quantify the reliability of this assessment, e.g.: using inter-annotator agreement scores and significance, and perform a larger scale evaluation if needed.\n\nThe procedure used for quantifying complexity and quality can be validated and possibly improved further\n\n- Section 2.3 states that ChatGPT is shown multiple samples evolved from the same seed example are shown to ChatGPT at a time for scoring their complexity (and this is possibly true for quality as well). Are these scores comparable across evalved sets from different seed examples? This is necessary because all these data points are used together as training data for training the Llama-based scorer. If they are not comparable, it might help to randomize the sets shown to ChatGPT for scoring.\n- Relatedly, it would help to have humans also score data points in terms of complexity and quality and see if the scores correlate with  \nChatGPT's judgments."

How can this issue be fixed?\n- Do you need to use the representations from the Llama-13B model for computing distances as well? Can you use a different (smaller?) model for computing distances than the one you instruction-tune?\n- DEITA-6K loses more to the random selection baseline than to the Vicuna model according to the human evaluation results in Table 4. This seems surprising. How does the random selection model perform compared to the Vicuna model in this case?"
