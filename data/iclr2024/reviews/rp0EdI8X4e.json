The authors also analyze the stability and the faithfulness of concepts introducing four desiderata, namely: (i) the degree of overlap with the ground-truth concepts, (ii) the robustness against random noise, (iii) the correctness of the predictions, and (iv) the stability of the output layer.\nWith a series of experiments, it is shown that the FVLC outperforms LCBMs both in accuracy and in stability of the concepts."

The presentation is clear and all parts can be easily understood, although it could be improved, see weaknesses. \nThe analysis of the possible instability effects in the concepts is sound and motivated by examples where LCBMs effectively struggle to predict the correct concepts. The proposed method for concept refinement is simple and works well in a wide range of case studies. In addition, the ablation study reveals that all terms included in FVLC are needed to improve the stability and accuracy of the model.\nEssentially, FVLC paves the use of language-based CBMs with faithfulness guarantees, which could be very helpful in applications."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "One major concern about the analysis is the question of the interpretability. The claim that if a concept $\\tilde c$ matches the top-k component of c leads to an equivalently interpretable concept depends on the assumption that c is already interpretable. This is implicit in the discussion and it seems to me that it is sidelined. Since the interpretability of the model is central in this paper, somehow this has to be verified, e.g., via concept accuracy, even for LCBMs. \n\nThe authors consider the LCBM as the standard reference for improving the concepts, but the optimization could have been done even without it since the alignment loss has to be w.r.t. concepts extracted with CLIP, avoiding the noise in fitting first the LCBM and then the FVLC. \n\nI feel the contribution would also improve by comparing with other SotA models, like Post-hoc CBMs and LaBo:\\\n[1] Yuksekgonul, Mert, Maggie Wang, and James Zou, \"Post-hoc concept bottleneck models.\" ICLR 2023 \\\n[2] Yang, Yue, et al. \"Language in a bottle: Language model guided concept bottlenecks for interpretable image classification.\" CVPR 2023\n\nAbout the presentation, it is somehow counterintuitive to mention $\\Tilde c$ and $c$ while there is a clear reference to the maps $\\Tilde g$ and $g$. Moreover, I am sure that all the extracted concepts are input-dependent, so it would be the case to indicate them with $g(x)$ or $c(x)$ to explicit their dependence.\nOne possible improvement of the presentation could be to comment on the definitions after their statements, indicating intuitive properties captured by them. Another point is the introduction of $ \\tilde c$ which is clear from the text but it should be stated before that the authors refer to the faithful concepts obtained with $\\TIlde g$.\n\nOne remark: the statement in section 5 that $\\tilde c = c$ in the limit of $\\alpha_1 \\to 0$ is not always true since it depends on the loss that is considered. What loss is used? In principle, different choices of the loss function would to more stable or less stable concepts for conditions (iii) and (iv)."

Although the authors claimed that they proposed a solution to deal with the stability issue of the label-free concept bottleneck model, the authors only focused on the prediction task over the vision dataset. I am wondering whether the proposed solution could be generalized to other settings such as the classification tasks over NLP data or tabular data.\n+ The metrics of evaluating the model stability are also concerning to me. I feel that this metric should be $\\epsilon$-invariant, which means that ideally the perturbation $\\epsilon$ should occur in the denominator of the metric. Otherwise, with larger epsilon, you can get larger stability, which seems to be counter-intuitive. Also, by looking at the other similar metrics in literature, such as the stability metric proposed in the model interpretability literature (Alvarez Melis, David, and Tommi Jaakkola. \"Towards robust interpretability with self-explaining neural networks.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 31 (2018).), they are also calculated by putting the input perturbation in the denominator. So it would be better if the authors could justify why they didn't choose to design their stability metric in this manner and ideally reference some other papers.\n+ The presentation could be further improved. For example, for Figure 3, the text in the figure is very tiny and it is very hard to tell what concepts they are. For Figure 2, I guess the box mixed with black and white dots should represent the noise but I cannot find any explanations for this. It would be better if the authors could clearly illustrate this figure in the caption."

Can the authors use any difficult datasets like HAM10k or MIMIC-CXR to bolster their claims. Medical images will make the claims stronger because if the explanations are not stable, it will raise trust issue among the users.\n8. I am confused with table 1. If the main message is to showcase that their method is more superior compared to the baselines, they should have the best cofiguration of their method and the baselines. Also they should have another table where they should conduct an ablation study to include different configurations of their method with various perturbations and compare the performance. Also, only PCBM and LCBM baselines are not enough. I would like to see the performances for LCBM and language in a bottle especially when the inputs and the concepts will be perturbed. Also thourough comparison is needed with basic CBM and some other methods for datasets where concepts are annotated. Also missing variances in table 1. \n9. Also, for table 2, nothing is highlighted or bolded.

The writing is clear and the captions are good but very long. Still some related work is missing. Importantly, i feel the datasets are fairly simple but i am increasing the score to 5."
