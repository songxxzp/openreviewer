                "value": "This paper proposes CLEX, a method that enables length extrapolation on Rotary position embedding (RoPE) by finetuning on a dataset. Prior work has found that finetuning with a position embedding scaling (PE scaling) on either the position or the frequency values of RoPE can enhance the extrapolation of a pre-trained language model. Based on the PE scaling, CLEX models the position-frequency values of RoPE with a neural ODE and the YaRN model, with an aim to learn the continuous dynamics over the length scaling factor during PE scaling. The experiments demonstrate a strong extrapolation compared with prior PE scaling methods (Position Interpolation, YaRN, CodeLLaMA) and non-PE scaling methods (ALiBi, RandomPos).\n\n**Post Rebuttal Update**\n\nI acknowledge the authors' efforts in addressing the questions. The new experiments have effectively addressed my concerns. As a result, I have raised my score."

If this is true, doesn't this imply an equivalent discrete modeling?\n* CLEX is adopting YaRN in equation 13, so it seems some part of the performance of CLEX is due to YaRN. An ablation of CLEX without YaRN is needed.\n* CLEX is based on PE scaling, which requires a finetuning dataset. However, non-PE scaling methods (e.g., ALiBi and RandomPos) don't require finetuning. So it doesn't seem fair to compare CLEX with non-PE scaling methods.\n* The author mentioned that CLEX is computationally demanding due to the evaluation on the integral. Maybe the author can comment more on the training time.\n* The author claimed that AliBi-like methods (attention biasing) struggle in practical tasks requiring long-context dependency; however, the cited evidence is on AliBi. Among the author-cited AliBi-like methods, there are attention-biasing methods that achieve better long-context dependency than Alibi. Maybe the author can clarify on this.\n* The notations are confusing sometimes. For example, $\\lambda$ is supposed to be an amplification factor but is missing in equation 13."

In tests, CLEX extends context windows to over 4x the training length without performance loss and beat several popular methods both in long sequence modeling and downstream tasks."

Is it necessary to utilize Neural ODE? In another word, can we use a regular NN? As it seems that a regular NN can do the same thing. (Not quite sure, for I'm not an expert of Neural ODE)\n\n2: Could you please provide more details about the training/fine-tuning? Did you train all the baseline models with the same number of tokens, the same batch size as well as the same steps? If so, for PI, its paper mentioned that they only fine-tuned the LLM for ~ 1000 steps, while for some other baselines such as replacing RoPE with Alibi for Llama-2, the tuning steps should definitely be much larger. With different required number of training steps is the performance comparison fair enough? \n\n3: Also, I'm wondering if there's any explanation to the poor performance on LongBench's synthetic tasks.\n\n4: Compared to Random Position, the main difference is that CLEX add adaptive frequency for different sequences, it that correct?\n\n5: Still about Random Position, its original paper and some blogs (https://kexue.fm/archives/9444, it's in Chinese, you may translate it to English first) showed that it shows good length generalization ability. But in  Table-1, Random Position does not work at all ( trained on 4k, and can only keep low PPL at 4k), do you have any thoughts about it?"

However, I somehow feel that it could also shine for \"superresolution\"/\"interpolation\", i.e. infilling missing data within a sequence. This feeling comes from your random sampling idea. It looks like you are basically simulating \"missing data\".\n* \"Unlike the previous PE scaling methods built on a larger scaling factor would lead to inferior performance on the lengths corresponding to smaller counterparts, the continuous PE scaling would enable non-destructively generalisation to larger scaling factors via adaptive continuous dynamics\".
