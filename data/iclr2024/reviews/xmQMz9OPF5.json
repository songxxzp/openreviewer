Therefore, does that suggest that the observed conclusion only mask sense with a fixed dataset with long enough training? \n  - In other words, is the bottleneck of scalable visual representation learning not about the methodology but more about data?\n- About asymmetric masking:\n  - Following my question above, another perspective to understand this phenomenon is due to the limited scalability [1] of asymmetric masking architecture proposed in MAE, which is also utilized as the main architecture in this work. While in Swinv2 and EVA, the MIM pre-training has been quite important for ViT training of giant sizes. Does the implementation of masking also affect the scalability of pre-training?\n  - Moreover, does the invariance of target representation suggest masking operation is the key in MKD, which might also explain why the learnt representation has similar weight distribution?\n- About backbone architecture:\n  - Throughout the whole paper, the authors utilize the vanilla ViT of different sizes for both the student and teacher networks, while DeiT has shown that architecture discrepancy exists when distilling  between different architectures like CNN and ViT. Will that be the same for MKD, like does the phenomenon still hold with a ConvNext teacher?\n- Overall, I think this is a quite interesting paper, and my questions are more open-ended to further enhance the insight of the observed phenomenon for future development.\n\n[1] Zhai, Xiaohua, et al. \"Scaling vision transformers.\" *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*. 2022."

A While the authors mention the instability and sensitivity of other methods, it should be noted that MKD also requires careful pipeline design and hyper-parameter selection. For example,  MAE with fixed m (momentum updating teacher\u2019s param) can achieve 84.3 at stage 2, however, in most cases in the ablation, MKD only outperforms MAE when the stage split number, epochs for each stage, and momentum parameter (m) and others are correctly set. This limits the practical application of MKD. This limits the practical application of MKD, as one could simply distill MAE for two stages with less time consumption and similar performance.\n\n3. The paper only explores the fine-tune setting of semi-supervised learning (SSL), which diminishes the differences between pre-training models. How about the linear-probe setting? Would teachers also matter? Additionally, it is unclear whether the models mentioned in Section 6 are supervisedly fine-tuned on IN or pre-trained models before fine-tuning.\n\n4. A minor weakness of the paper is that only l2 distillation is performed, neglecting other potential distillation methods."

Given that the performance on different downstream tasks peaks at different stages (Table 1), it is not clear how to choose the number of distillation stages to arrive at a single general model that can work across tasks (even beyond the ones discussed - eg. for embodied navigation [1]). \n3. **Do the trends hold across random seeds?**. For a single random initialized teacher, Table 1 shows 2 stage being better for classification and stage 3 being better for detection/segmentation.

Is the total number of pre-training iterations controlled across different methods in Table 2, 3, 4 and 5? \n4. The authors compute properties **within** model and show that these match across different choices of teachers (Figure 2 and 3). Do the learned layers **across distilled models** show any correspondences? eg. how do the cross-model CKA similarity maps [2] look?\n5. Table 6: Why is MAE faster than dBOT when both use an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture?\n6. \"Additionally dBOT achieves more local attention than previous works\". Can authors clarify this comment in context of Figure 2? It seems like MAE's attention distance plot is similar to the distilled models'.\n7. Section 6. SVD line 5: Shouldn't lesser correlation in model's output result in lower redundancy?\n8. C.1. I think I understand why the need for a decoder could be \"eased when target contains high-level semantics\". But can the authors elaborate a bit on why the \"existence of decoder\" may hurt?\n\n\n# Minor typos/suggestions:\n1. Section 1: A masked image **is** passed through the \n2.

The observation of the insignificance of the choice of teacher network is somewhat aligned to the observation of MAE, which simply opts for raw image pixels and surpasses previous methods like BeiT or MaskFeat with more sophisticated target representation by a non-trivial margin. This is also validated from the results in appendix B.1, which shows *using the patch token obtained by a randomly initialized network as the target can achieve comparable results with a pixel as a target.*\n\n3. The authors claim that *Using a random model as teachers not only avoids an extra pre-training stage, but also alleviates the painstaking selection of the target representations*.
