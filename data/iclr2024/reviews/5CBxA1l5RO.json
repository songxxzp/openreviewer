The proposed model is validated in handwriting in-air and fork manipulation datasets. The proposed TimewarpVAE outperforms baseline beta-VAE and ablative versions by reconstructing samples that can be better spatially aligned with the test input. Qualitative result also shows a preferred interpolation performance in the latent space on the handwriting dataset."

The trajectory is passed through a beta VAE and a piece-wise linear time warping module, along with the temporal input, that uses DTW to align the input time to a canonical time. This design attempts to factorize spatial variations to the beta-VAE and temporal variations to the temporal module.  They evaluate their approach by benchmarking the reconstruction error using three latent dimensions against a beta VAE with no time warping and also the timewarpVAE architecture with the timewarping module set to the identity, finding improved millimeter error performance and rate distortion, which is defined as the KL divergence loss in the VAE. They further show improved reconstruction for handwriting datasets compared to PCA, across choices of the latent dimension, and close with some ablations"
