The authors introduce a linear autoencoding model, then expand to a nonlinear framework using deep autoencoding. This framework aids in designing controllers using stability-constrained neural networks, without needing prior system equation knowledge. Its efficacy is demonstrated on reaction-diffusion and fluid flow systems using time series data. Empirical results are promising, when compared to existing DMD based methods."

Thus in the experiment, the original full-order NI4C should be compared, as an ablation study for DeepROM. However, in current experiments, only LQR controls are compared.\n\n2) Insignificant performance improvement. The performance of the DeepROC on the vortex-shedding task seems to be worse than LQR baselines (Figure 3(b,c)).  The overall idea of reduced-order control is not new, thus the performance improvement is an important measure of contribution.\n\n3) Lack of higher dimensional and more complex datasets. In the abstract, the authors state that: \"Controlling complex PDEs often necessitates dimensionality reduction for computational efficiency.\" However, the experiments are about 1D reaction-diffusion and 2D N-S(with low Re). Such systems can be learned and predicted efficiently via full-order neural networks, such as simple FNN, DeepONet, FNO, PINN, and their variants. More complex datasets, such as 2D/3D N-S with turbulence or shock are needed to show the necessity of reduced-order models."
