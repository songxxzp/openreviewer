The paper introduces an approach based on optimal transport to generate a patch, such that the estimated feature distribution of corrupted source images becomes close to the distribution of features from the target class, using either the Wasserstein and Sliced-Wasserstein distance. The black-box transferability of the attack is compared to state-of-the-art attacks for the Image Classification task on ImageNet-1K, on a broad set of networks. Qualitative results with a printed patch are also presented to demonstrate the real-world applicability of the attack."

This large coverage is important, as it shows the adaptability and effectiveness of the proposed attack across diverse neural network architectures. Furthermore, as mentioned in the paper, recent networks and training recipes are both naturally more robust than older CNNs, it is then fundamental to evaluate against them as well. From the results, we can see that attacks optimized for a specific category of models does not transfer as efficiently to all other categories.\n- **High Transferability Results:** The proposed approach demonstrates strong transferability results, outperforming in general both state-of-the-art patch and non-patch attacks. Notably, the approach accomplishes this while maintaining a similar level of computational efficiency as other existing methods.\n- **Clarity and Reproducibility:** The paper is well written and easy to follow, with a clear description of the proposed approach and of the experiments. Additionally, the code is available as supplementary material which helps reproducibility."

Thus, it would be more meaningful if this paper could provide the performances of the proposed approach with the change of angles or lights for the qualitative evaluation.\n2. For digital experiments, the authors select from the previously defined families the following models and measure the attacking transferability when the resulting patch is used to fool the remaining models. The results show that the proposed approach can generate the stronger patch attack than its counterparts. Yet, the visual perception to human vision should also be considered. It would be more convincing if the image with the generated adversarial patch with the proposed method and its counterparts can be evaluated with the PSNR or SSIM as the evaluation metrics for the degree of recognition for human vision.\n3. According to the table of computation time in the Appendix of this work, the proposed approach with sliced version SW and the normal W can achieve comparable efficiency with the previous methods.

Thus, I'm concerned that the technical contribution of this paper might be too weak for ICLR.\n\nThe experimental results lack discussions and explanations: For instance, why is it that in the experiments, the Sliced-Wasserstein distance (SW) always underperforms compared to the Wasserstein ones (W)? What causes this? I'm concerned about whether the settings for the two proposed methods are fair. Moreover, I believe there needs to be a more comprehensive ablation study and explanation regarding the choice of target layers. The authors only investigated the impact of the last three feature layers. Why did adding J-2 significantly affect performance?\n\nPhysical experiments are somewhat weak: I believe this paper fails to demonstrate the superiority of its method in physical experiments, especially since the author claims that the method provides better transferability but only compares it to a weaker baseline (L2).

                "value": "I believe the main drawback of this article is that it does not discuss other methods based on distribution matching.\nThe article's main claim is somewhat ambiguous; is it advocating that distribution-matching methods are superior, or that methods based on optimal transport are superior? A comparison with other distribution-matching methods would make the paper more compelling.\nAnother issue is that the article's statements are not sufficiently rigorous. The statements seem to suggest that the method presented can relax dependency on specific models. However, in reality, the method still relies on a particular model, even though it exhibits better transfer performance in experiments."
