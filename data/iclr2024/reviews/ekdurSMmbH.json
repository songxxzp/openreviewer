                "value": "The paper presents an off-policy selection (OPS) method, which aims to determine the best policy from a set of predefined policies. In contrast to the conventional approach of selecting a universal policy, this paper suggests an initial step of clustering trajectories (or, equivalently, participants) and subsequently selecting the most suitable policy for each sub-group. Additionally, the paper introduces a data augmentation technique to address situations where the number of participants within each group is insufficient to accurately estimate policy value. The evaluation is performed in two settings: an offline setting for intelligent tutoring and an off-policy setting for simulated sepsis treatment."

It was hard for me to follow the details of the paper both the methodology and experiments at some points.\n- At the outset, the idea of selecting a policy out of many for each sub-group sounds like designing a new policy. I have difficulty understanding whether, during the partitioning step, any information unavailable to the policy is being used or not. In fact, if there is some information, like patient characteristics, which are used to cluster participants but were not used in training the policy, why not incorporate them in the first place to train the policy? \n- There are some inconsistencies in the problem formulation and explanations. Please refer to my questions.\n- The choice objective to choose partitioning requires further motivation. Please refer to my questions.\n- On the evaluation side, some values need further clarification. For instance, true reward, or AE of OPE.\n- The writing could be improved as there are many typos in the text. For example: \"it it\" in the abstract, \"a initial\" in Assumption 2, \"an classic\" on page 6\n\nRecommendations:\n- I recommend applying your technique to real offline data of sepsis treatment. For instance, I chose Raghu et al. from your paper and checked its 2023 citations and it seems there are many real evaluations of the policy values including new reliable methods.\n- I recommend discussing the fairness aspect of the problem as your approach might be helpful for underrepresented groups."

I thought Assumptions 1 and 2 imply a one-to-one correspondence between participants and the distribution of initial state. However, a stronger assumption seems to be made on page 3 last paragraph.\n4. I'm having a hard time understanding the notation of $V^\\pi_{K_m}$ in Definition 1. What distribution $s_0$ is drawn from? \n5. Regarding objective (1), isn't the sum over the second term just the value for behavioral policy?\n6. Regarding evaluations, please elaborate what are the values reported on the y-axis of Figure 1 in complete detail. Also, what is a true reward mentioned on page 7 for the IE experiment and how AE is defined on page 8?"

If the initial state is unique to participants wouldn't it be possible to learn a single policy that performs well across all states? Why do they think this doesn't happen? Is the policy class being trained on offline data not rich enough?"
