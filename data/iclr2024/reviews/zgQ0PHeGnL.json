The proposed method, ElliDock, models the protein-protein docking interface using an elliptic paraboloid approximation. By aligning the interfaces of two unbound proteins, ElliDock ensures roto-translation equivariance. The experimental results show the method outperforms other deep learning-based methods and achieves the fastest inference speed."

As shown in Tables 1&2, HDOCK outperforms other methods by a significant margin, suggesting it may already effectively address the rigid-body docking challenge. Although the ElliDock\u2019s inference speed is much faster than HDOCK, its performance is unsatisfactory. Given real-world applications, the value of faster inference time seems negligible, especially if the docking challenge doesn't necessitate high-throughput situations. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\n2. Despite the considerable depth in the methods section discussing the rationale and procedure of using an elliptic paraboloid for approximation, it remains unclear how this looks like on real-world data. It would be good if there are some visualization experiments showing the learned paraboloid interfaces.\n3. The paper's notations appear cluttered and confusing. For example, iEq.(8) denotes the other protein as $H_{-p}$, which is unconventional. In Eq. (12), the FC layer maps representation to $4$-dim without explanation. Meanwhile, Eq. (13) introduces the hyperparameter $M$ without elaboration. The bracket notation further complicates understanding. For better clarity, consider excluding the $p$, since most operations apply similarly to both proteins, and employ subscript notation for indexing.\n4. A deeper exploration and connection with surface-based methodologies, such as MaSIF, would be beneficial. It would be insightful to include a comparison with it in the benchmarking section."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. In Eqs. (3)(4), the coefficient $\\alpha_{j\\to i}$ appears to merely normalize the inner product of $q$ and $k$, without taking into account the keys from other edges. This approach seems to limit the attention mechanism's capacity to capture interactions among edges or nodes. Given this, wouldn't it be more straightforward to directly map the message $m_{j\\to i}$ to a scalar coefficient $\\alpha_{j\\to i}$?\n2. In Sec. 4.3, there's a mention that pre-trained models like HDOCK could be prone to data leakage issues. From my understanding, HDOCK functions as a template-based model and doesn't utilize learning in its scoring function. Could you provide a more detailed explanation regarding the concerns of data leakage?\n3. In Eq. (12), while $F_p$ is identified as a 4-dimensional vector, its fourth element seems not to be used in the main paper.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the method introduced to address the rigid-body docking problem. I\u2019m willing to raise my score if all the concerns listed in the Weakness section can be addressed during rebuttal."

                "value": "The paper introduces a novel supervised learning approach for protein docking, focusing on predicting the interface between ligand and receptor proteins in the form of an elliptic-paraboloid. This method operates under the assumption that the true docked pockets are precisely situated along our predicted interface. The primary aim of this learning process is to identify elliptic-paraboloids that align with these ground-truth docked pockets. This objective is complemented by additional constraints, such as the loss associated with elliptic-paraboloid overlap, which ensures spatial separation of protein pairs at the interface, and the standard dock loss, quantifying the difference between predicted and ground-truth rotation and translation matrices.\n\nThe authors illustrate that the key advantage of this method lies in its efficiency during inference. Once the elliptic-paraboloid interface is predicted, it enables the efficient calculation of docking poses. Furthermore, this proposed method exhibits equivariance to arbitrary rotations and translations of the proteins, a crucial feature ensuring the generalization of the docking process.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of their approach, the authors conducted experiments using two specific benchmark datasets: \"Docking benchmark version 5\" and \"The Structural Antibody Database.\" They compared their method to four baseline machine learning-based docking techniques: HDock (pretrained), Multimer (pretrained), EquiDock (trained from scratch), and DiffDock-PP (trained from scratch).\n\nIn the first benchmark dataset, the authors demonstrated that their ElliDock outperforms most of the baseline methods in terms of docking accuracy while achieving a significant reduction in inference time, with the exception of the pretrained model.\n\nIn the second benchmark dataset, the authors showed that ElliDock outperforms most of the baseline methods, except for HDock. The authors noted that HDock's superior performance may be attributed to the possibility of data leakage. They further conducted an ablation study to highlight the importance and effectiveness of each training objective function introduced in the ElliDock method."

More compelling evidence supporting the presence of leakage in HDock would be valuable.\n\nThe authors demonstrate a significant improvement in inference time for their method compared to baseline approaches, yet the exact source of this efficiency enhancement remains somewhat unclear. An in-depth complexity analysis would be helpful in shedding light on the reasons behind this improvement. Typically, if a method directly predicts rotation and translation matrices, inference time should be as swift as the execution of these operations.\n\nIn addition to comparisons with machine learning-based docking methods, it would be beneficial to provide an overview of results in comparison to well-established docking methods that do not rely on machine learning techniques.\n\nFurthermore, sharing the splits of the second benchmark dataset used in your experiments would be advantageous, as it would enable others to replicate the results more easily and conduct experiments with the same splits in the future.
