There should be discussion on practical architectures with intra-layer links, which is crucial for establishing the usefulness of the proposed theory. ResNet and DenseNet are not appropriate for justification: they use across-layer links which are restricted (ResNet uses only identity mapping), while the links considered in this work are intra-layer with little restriction.\n\n**Intra-link is strong:** the network structure with intra-layer links seems too strong. In particular, we can show a much stronger argument that a two-layer intra-layer network can represent any classic neural network. In particular, suppose the target network we would like to represent has depth $k$ with width $w_1...w_k$, then it can be realized by a two-layer intra-layer network with the width of its hidden layer being $\\sum_i w_i$: we partition the neurons into $k$ groups with number $w_i$, then it simulates the target network by using intra-layer links from the $ith$ group to the next one. Effectively, a single layer of an intra-link network can be a classic network.\n\n**Weak results:** it's only proven that such strong network structure can represent particular hard-case functions used in previous depth-separation works. The minimum expectation for the conclusion is like \"this new network structure can represent any deep classic networks\", which I suspect can be easily obtained. However, the result only concerns the particular \"saw-tooth\" functions and is thereby very weak."

In particular, the paper studies the cases where (1) each neuron depends on its proceedings neurons, and (2) every two neurons are linked. They show that this model can approximate the sawtooth function with a significant reduction in width compared to a model of the same depth without intra-layer links. In particular, the reduction in width is exponential. The authors imply that these results should spark reflection in the field of depth separation theory, where depth is often assumed to play a crucial role in efficiently approximating certain classes of functions such as the sawtooth function. The authors also show preliminary results on common datasets (such as CIFAR100 and Tinyimagnet and others)."

Theorem 10 nicely explains the effect of intra-linked layers in terms of function approximation. Lemma 11 specializes Theorem 10 to the sawtooth function. In general, I enjoyed the cleanness and preciseness of the exposition of the theorems.\n4.

                "value": "1. I appreciate that the authors put forward an extensive explanation of why they think that the intra-linked layer is different from stacking layers. From an information propagation perspective, however, I still struggle to agree with the authors. The quantity $\\tilde{f}_i^{(j)}$ as in the equation of Notation 2 depends on the previous $p < j$ preactivations $g_i^{(0)}, \\dots, g_i^{(p-1)}$. This is similar to add skip connection, where the information is residually added on a neuron-by-neuron way to form the representation of the next neuron. Of course, as it authors point out, it is not the standard way depth is thought in neural networks, and there are differences in terms of the absence of extra weights, and different handling of nonlienarities, which also has an impact on the function class representable and the mechanics of producing linear pieces.  \n2. Related to (1). I am not entirely convinced of why the authors have centered the story around the role of width vs depth. I think the intra-layer mechanism is something out of the scope of depth-vs-width in the way fully connected neural networks are treated in the dept separation theory. In the depth separation theory, the objective is to study the roles of width and depth in the \"natural\" way they are treated in the literature. In the paper, the authors design a new architecture in which each layer has something that resembles depth, and claim that the paper's objective is to \"inspire further contemplation and discussion regarding the depth separation theory\", which in my honest view is misleading. I would like the authors' clarification on this point. \n3. The potential of the architecture for practical usage seems very limited. The computation is inherently sequential and thus cannot make use of existing hardware optimization through parallelization."
