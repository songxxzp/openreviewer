The authors utilize a simple yet effective trick, i.e., adding a parameter-efficient codebook, and expecting it to filter out the unnecessary information in the embeddings. The method significantly boosts the performance of the baseline EmbCLIP on several benchmarks."

I was quite attracted by the example of Figure 1, in which the authors describe the situation that the keys would only lie on a flattened surface, not a corner or somewhere else. I do like the motivation and expect the authors to incorporate such a human prior into the method yet I did not find it in the paper. I would suggest the authors consider incorporating a text prompt on the CLIP text model such as \"the chair is usually on the floor\" etc. Not necessarily for all the benchmarks but I think it would be interesting to see whether several cases can be improved.\n\nThe second weakness is about codebook collapse, this is a good motivation and interesting problem that is also related to interpreting what codebook really learns. I would expect whether the current method exists codebook collapse without dropout during training. This means the authors may need to conduct ablation studies and provide illustrations about collapse or not."

The experimental results demonstrate performance improvement in object goal navigation and object displacement tasks across various benchmarks.

The nearest neighbor probably should be done by treating learned codes as query.  In stead of using the pooled/weighted sum features, the authors can use a one-hot vector to select each code and upsample it to 1568 dimension.  It'd be more interesting to see what are learned in the codebook and what do the retrievals look like for each task.\n\n3.
