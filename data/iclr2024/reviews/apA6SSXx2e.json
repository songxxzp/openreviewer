The authors claim \"With TC, newly joined neighbors of a node tend to become less \ninteractive with that node\u2019s existing neighbors, compromising the generalizability of node embeddings for LP at the testing time\". \n\nThere is empirical evidence that GNNs perform better on high-degree nodes than on low-degree nodes.

ATC (approximated topological \nconcentration) relies on powers-hops of the transition matrix. This is $O(Kd(|E| + |V|))$, where $K$ is the maximum hop. \n\nThe experiments show that TC boosts the performance of LP in several basic baselines. No comparisons with subgraph-based baselines."
