The authors then fine-tune Stable Diffusion with this dataset, with the option to continuously update with online data. Generated images are then projected back to low-dimensional states.

                "value": "While the paper shows promising improvements over the non-augmented baseline, unclear presentation and missing details make it hard to determine the contribution of the paper. In particular, \n- **(Incomplete description of algorithm)** A huge amount of detail is missing when the authors claim they convert states to images and then back to states in Section 4.1. This is highly non-trivial and should be justified further. For example, can the authors present pictures of rendered states, what is the error from converting to image and back again? There is also no description of how Stable Diffusion was fine-tuned or how long online image generation takes. Furthermore, it is not explained how the authors would generate low-dimensional actions or obtain rewards from an image model.\n- **(Benefit of trajectories vs. transitions)** The paper claims \u201cfull trajectories offer a more comprehensive source of information, enabling RL agents to better learn from past experiences\u201d without evidence in the introduction. No comparison is made to the transition-based baseline in [1] which also evaluates on the same MuJoCo locomotion environments in Figure 2. Furthermore, [3] also proposes a trajectory based method for generating synthetic data with diffusion models and is not discussed.\n- **(Why project states to images)** The paper claims that generating a collection of images outperforms single states in Figure 5. It is unclear why the simpler option of generating a sequence of states as in [2, 3] is not chosen. Given the image-based approach, it may also be asked why the authors do not focus on upsampling image datasets from the start, e.g. from [4].\n- **(Incomplete experimental description)** Unclear what experimental setup is used in Figure 2. Is each figure the average of 4 different D4RL datasets? No explanation for what environments or datasets are used in Figure 5.\n- **(Unclear description of sampling scheme)** There is an extremely vague description of what the reward or TD-error based pickup strategy means in Appendix A.1.1.\n\nMinor\n- The description of the state diffusion model in Appendix A.2 is copied nearly verbatim from Appendix B.2 of [1].

                "value": "\"ATraDiff: Accelerating Online Reinforcement Learning with Imaginary Trajectories\" addresses the challenge of training autonomous agents with sparse rewards in online reinforcement learning (RL). The authors propose a novel approach called Adaptive Trajectory Diffuser (ATraDiff), which uses offline data to learn a generative diffusion model. This model generates synthetic trajectories that serve as data augmentation, thereby enhancing the performance of online RL methods.\n\nThe key advantage of ATraDiff is its adaptability, which allows it to handle varying trajectory lengths and mitigate distribution shifts between online and offline data. The simplicity of ATraDiff enables it to integrate seamlessly with a wide range of RL methods. Empirical evaluations show that ATraDiff consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various environments, with significant improvements in complex settings.\n\nThe paper also discusses related work in the areas of offline pre-training for online RL, diffusion models in RL, and data augmentation in RL. It provides a background on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), diffusion models, and replay buffers, which are essential components of the proposed method.\n\nThe methodology section of the paper details the design and training of ATraDiff, its deployment in online RL, and an online adaptation mechanism that addresses distribution shifts. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ATraDiff in improving the performance of online RL methods and offline-to-online RL algorithms in complicated environments."

                "value": "A solid and technically sound paper. Addresses an important problem in RL using generative (diffusion) models for generating imaginary trajectories. Generality is another strength of the method -  ATraDiff can be integrated with any online RL algorithm with a replay buffer. Authors address in a clever way varying trajectory lengths and potential distribution shifts. The efficiency of the method was confirmed by a diverse set of experiments and ablation studies."
