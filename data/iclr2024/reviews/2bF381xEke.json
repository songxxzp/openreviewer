                "value": "In this article, the authors explore the limitations of Graph Attention Networks (GATs), particularly concerning their dense attention weights, which allocate probability mass to all neighbors of a node. This denseness can dilute the model's focus, as every edge is given some attention. To address this issue, the authors introduced a novel, fully differentiable sparse attention mechanism that allows for precise control over attention density. This mechanism is a continuous relaxation of the conventional top-k operator, facilitated through user-defined constraints.\n\nThe authors propose two unique variations of this sparse attention mechanism:\n1. A local approach that ensures a consistent degree per node.\n2. A global method that retains a specific percentage of the complete graph.\n\nThrough a comprehensive evaluation, they assess the five sparse GATs on metrics like sparsity, performance, and interpretability, offering valuable insights into the trade-offs between accuracy and both sparsity and interpretability. The findings reveal that the new sparse attention mechanism offers superior representability over baseline models, with the local approach showing promise."

It is doubtable if one would like to sacrifice the accuracy. Thus, the paper should also add one baseline, i.e., adopts GAT as a baseline for accuracy and adopts a post-hoc explainer for GAT for explainability. If such simple baseline outperforms the proposed method in terms of both accuracy and interpretability, or has comparable interpretability and better accuracy, then the proposed method is unnecessary. \n3. The scalability of the proposed MapSelect-G is questionable as one need to solve SparseMap problem in each epoch. It is better to provide time complexity analysis and real running time on the used datasets. In addition, the datasets used are very small. The authors should also conduct experiments on larger datasets.\n4. Currently, the proposed method is only limited to graph attention network.
