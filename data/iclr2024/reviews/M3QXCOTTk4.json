As has been demonstrated in [EDAC] and [REDQ], I acknowledge that using ensemble learning for the **value function** could lead to improved performance, as the value can be more accurate, with uncertainty. But what is the motivation for having **multiple policies** for ensemble (because they are sample generators, rather than learners). Should not those samplers aim at more efficiently decreasing the uncertainty in the value function?\n\nThis is a concern with the continuous setting. BootstrapDQN is purely a **value-based** method, and in discrete tasks, the epsilon-greedy exploration can be regarded as sampling from an off-policy uniform policy, this should not be a problem.\n\n### On BootstrapDQN:\n\nIn BootstrapDQN, different samples are assigned different weights to analog bootstrap sampling. It would not be surprising to see individual BootstrapDQN perform worse than DDQN. To verify the claim that *BootstrapDQN\u2019s performance improvement is purely based on voting* made by the authors, a comparison between Bootstrap Sampling/ normal sampling; and a comparison between majority voting and \n\n\nFigure 2: The reported results of SAC can not match the open-source implementations. This might be due to the usage of a different size of buffer (200k). Could the authors please explain more about this?\n\n\n### On Performance:\n\nThe performance of CERL seems marginal in Figure 7. Also in Figure 7, BootstrapDQN seems not helpful at all.\n\n\n### On related work:\n\n\nThis work [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07288.pdf] discussed the ensemble learning that trades off between exploration and exploitation using different reward values may also be worth a discussion.\n\nThis work [https://openreview.net/forum?id=NOApNZTiTNU] and [REDQ] discussed the usage of the ensemble in Q-learning.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the main paper is very well written and the experiments appear quite thorough, the reviewer took issue with the way that some conclusions were presented. In particular the connection to exploration (which is in the title) ignores some major alternative explanations of the results. While the reviewer recommends to accept the paper, some phrases *need* to be changed, and some discussion needs to be added, to prevent the casual reader from misinterpreting the text and results. These are:\n\n1. \"First, it challenges some previous work\u2019s claims that the improved performance of approaches such as Bootstrapped DQN in some tasks comes from improved exploration\" (p.3): as mentioned earlier in the paper, ensemble methods are widely used to drive exploration into unseen regions of the state-action space. However, the authors claim that \"Surprisingly, simply aggregating the learned policies at test-time provides a huge performance boost in many environments\" (p.3), and proceed to downplay the effect of exploration in favor of an explanation based on \"aggregation\". This is a problem in statements like \"the two cases[, DQN(indiv.) and Double DQN,] have access to the same amount of data and have the same network capacity\" (p.3), as the change in exploration means that the two algorithms are based on different data distribution and will therefore behave differently, irrespective of the on- and off-policy-ness of the data. This potential interaction between exploration (which part of the state-space is covered) and on-policy-ness (which member got to sample it) cannot be distinguished with the presented experiments, but the text reads as if the latter is the only obvious conclusion (see below).\n\n2. \"These results confirm our hypothesis regarding the cause of the observed performance degradation\" (p.5). This is dangerous abductive reasoning: experimental evidence that is consistent with your hypothesis does not make your hypothesis true (one can only falsify a hypothesis). This may sound like a nitpick, but the paper does not discuss the exploration effect of ensembles enough. For example, in Figure 3 (middle), the BootDQN (indiv.) curve is significantly above the Passive (10%) curve. If indeed Algo 2 and Algo 3 are exactly equivalent except for how often they sample the other (non-passive) ensemble members, and *only* this affects the performance due to off-policy sampling, then both curves (which have seen the same fraction of off-policy samples) should perform identical. The fact that they do not shows that there must be another effect at work here. This could be the exploration, but the experiments do not allow to distinguish these potential effects. To be fair, the reviewer also does not know how to distinguish exploration and on-policy-ness with the given setup, but another setup might be able to (e.g. with intrinsic-reward methods where the exploration can be separated from who acts). The presented analysis is strong enough for publication (a new setup is not needed), but these ambiguities must be discussed!\n\n3. While the reviewer liked most experiments (e.g. Figure 3 and 4 are great!), Figure 5 seems to test DQN with a very small replay buffer, where even the aggregated ensemble does not perform as well as Double DQN. This makes some conclusions suspect. For example, does the aggregated performance improves when more layers are shared? Or does the ensemble become indistinguishable from the baseline? If the authors would have picked a larger replay buffer (e.g. 4M), the performance would improve in the first and worsen in the second case. This would have an impact, as it shows that sharing layers in the ensemble reduces the positive effect it can have (e.g. by exploration).\n\n4. The main hypothesis of the paper is that \"the curse of diversity\" hurts individual member performance due the large number of off-policy samples. This makes sense, as an individual member can make 90% of all decisions correctly and still have poor performance, whereas a majority vote of the ensemble will agree with high certainty on the correct action. Ultimately this is the reason why BootDQN explores well. However, CERL seems to have almost as much diversity as the L=0 ensemble. CERL is a representation learning algorithm, which seems to be at odds with the main hypothesis. Contrast this with BootDQN which switches ensemble members mid-episode. If this algorithm would improve individual performance, the reviewer would accept it as a fix of the identified problem. With CERL presented as the \"solution\", the reviewer wonders: is the underlying problem is indeed \"diversity\"? Please discuss why representation learning fixes the off-policy-ness of the data (there are some attempts, but it is still vague). \n\nIn summary: there is a lot to love about the paper, but the authors need to reformulate some critical points (or convince the reviewer that those are not critical). Only under the condition that this happens, this reviewer recommends acceptance.  \n\n**Minor comments**\n\n- The figure captions should contain more information about the shown algorithms (ensemble size, replay buffer size, L, ...) to make them more self-contained for cross-reading.  \n- Ensembles are primarily used because they are good out-of-distribution detectors. An experiment measuring this would have been very welcome."

                "value": "- If one accepts the idea that ensembles are primarily for exploration, then the diversity of responses is actually a feature, not a bug. Given that few wrong decisions per episode can significantly reduce the performance of an individual ensemble member, why do the authors actually consider the poor individual performance an issue, in particular when the aggregate performance is better than the baseline (e.g. on Mujoco)?\n- How did the baseline (Double DQN and vanilla SAC) explore? If the baseline worked so well, doesn't this imply exploration is not very important in the tested environments? How would the analysis look like if it would concentrate on hard-exploration environments?"

This phenomenon is where\nindividual members of a data-sharing ensemble underperform relative to their single agent counterparts due the high proportion of off-policy data relative to each individual ensemble member and the agents' inability to learn effectively from such off-policy data.\n\nThe authors first demonstrate in the bootstrapped DQN setting (a common ensemble Q-learning method) that individual ensemble members perform poorly. Then, the authors run experiments to show the underperformance of an individual learner when there is a low self-generated to \"other-generated\" ratio in the replay buffer. This experiment, along with some reasoning, leads to the conclusion that the curse of diversity indeed exists.\n\nThey then investigate whether the curse of diversity can be ameliorated through larger replay buffers. The results are mixed, suggesting larger replay buffers may sometimes mitigate the curse, though largely do not. They then investigate ways to reduce the curse of diversity by directly reducing diversity in the ensemble, but find that it can adversely impact the underlying ensemble method.\n\nThey then introduce Cross-Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL), as a mechanism to mitigate the curse while preserving the benefits of the underlying ensemble method. CERL works by adding auxiliary tasks to ensemble members, having them learn value functions of other ensemble members and find that CERL mitigates the curse of diversity without adversely impacting performance."
