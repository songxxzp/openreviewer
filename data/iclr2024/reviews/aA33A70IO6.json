The paper has introduced a rather simple approach to tackle this problem: let the model generate the harmful data but perform the alignment by training on harmful data and the analysis. Through two benchmark datasets, the authors have demonstrated very good results: not only it outperforms the plain SFT baseline, it also outperforms some popular alignment approaches including Critique-Revise and CoH. As a reference, SFT achieves 63% harmless and CoH is about 64.7 while the best approach in the paper achieves 74.1 harmless rate.\n\nA big advantage in the proposed approach is its simplicity, the approach consists simply of generating \"bad\" examples and append analysis then train on SFT. Such simplicity probably hints for bigger impact and larger application. \n\nThe paper's analysis is well performed including interesting ablation studies."

Moreover Figure 2 which discusses this work has a very low-information caption, that is largely redundant with the figure itself: \"Each histogram is composed of three segments with distinct colors, labeled with three score numbers...\"\n\nThe results in Tables 1 & 2 purporting to show improved performance are lacking some important rows to put the results into context:\n* In Table 1, both rows showing improvement over baselines use Alpaca as the Mistake Source. For a fair comparison, the baselines should also make use of mistakes generated by Alpaca.\n* In Table 2, the row showing improvement over baselines uses ChatGLM as the Mistake Source.

The authors use GPT-4 scores (plus human verification) on generated responses / analysis to demonstrate that discrimination is easier than generation. But in my view, discrimination requires to output a definite classification result (such as safe or unsafe), whose performance can be easily assessed via objective metrics like accuracy. The analysis may help the model to conduct discrimination. But its generation quality is not equal to discrimination results, especially the quality is measured via GPT-4 in a \u201ccontinuous\u201d scale of 1-10.\n\n2. The derivation in Equation (2) of Section 4 is not rigorous. The authors get a conclusion that $p(T|Y,X)$ is proportional to $p(Y|X,T)$. This indicates that the gap between $\\log p(T|Y,X)$ and $\\log p(Y|X,T)$ is a scalar. Following this, if we train a safety discrimination model with the loss of $\\log p(T|Y,X)$, we can directly obtain a safe response generation model. This is counter-intuitive and needs more explanations. I\u2019m afraid that the authors miss some important assumptions in their derivation.\n\n3. In Section 5.1, the authors only use Alpaca as their base model in the experiment. Since Alpaca is a weak base model, improving its performance may be relatively easy. I wonder whether the proposed method can still work well on stronger base models such as Vicuna."
