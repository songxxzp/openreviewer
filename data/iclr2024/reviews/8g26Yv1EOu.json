The approach uses model-based reinforcement learning with neural ODEs to predict how excitatory processes in a network will change over time as the network structure evolves. It incorporates Gradient-Descent based Model Predictive Control (GD-MPC) to provide flexibility in policy development, accommodating prior knowledge and constraints. To handle complex planning problems with high dimensionality, the authors introduce an Amortize Network Interventions (ANI) framework, which allows pooling of optimal policies from historical data and various contexts while ensuring efficient knowledge transfer. This method has broad applications, including disease control and traffic optimization."

It is better to conduct a more comprehensive review of the topic.\n\n2. In the definition of the temporal graph network, what are the definitions of edges in the two examples given in the paper? I do not find formal definitions. Could you please clarify?\n\n3. On page 3, it is claimed that the \"high-dimensional event sequences $\\{X_t\\}_{t\\ge 0}$ has a stationary dynamics\". What do you mean by \"stationary\"? If $X_t$ is the accumulated counts up to time $t$, it is unlikely to be a stationary time series. Please clarify.\n\n4. Is the influence matrix $W$ in equation~(4) a given matrix or learned from the data?\n\n5. The use of mean field approximation on page 4 seems to be rather ad-hoc, without much theoretical or even heuristic justifications. Can you give an example to show the difference between the actual reward and the one calculated based on the mean-field approximation? Are they actually close? Perhaps some simulation studies can be carried out to show the difference in actual reduction in intensity using these two reward objectives in some simple settings.\n\n6. On page 5, it is stated that \"Given a sequence of local policies $\\{\\pi_i\\}$, $1\\le i\\le M$,  addressing $M$ distinct sub-problems, our goal is to create an amortized policy $\\pi_{amo}$\". However, I did not find any detail on how this goal can be achieved. Can you clarify?\n\n7. The label of the y-axis in Figure 3 reads \"Intensity Cost\". What is the definition of the \"Intensity Cost\"?\n\n\n[1] Delattre, S., Fournier, N., & Hoffmann, M. (2016). Hawkes processes on large networks.\n\n[2] Fang, G., Xu, G., Xu, H., Zhu, X., & Guan, Y.
