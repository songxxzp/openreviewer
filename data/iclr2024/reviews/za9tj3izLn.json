It incorporates the concept of bounded confidence, dynamically adjusting the influence weight on target nodes based on their similarity between the target node and their neighbor nodes, which could better simulate the propagation and aggregation of information in graph structures. And the results shows that ODNET outperforms other graph neural network models in node classification tasks and decreases the over-smooth problem.  Furthermore, this method has also been successfully applied to various types of graphs in this paper, including heterophilic graphs, homophilic graphs, and hypergraphs. Lastly, through ODNET, it becomes possible to explain the internal information exchange within networks and the roles of genes in different metabolic pathways."

                "value": "1. It still remains very unclear to me why opinion dynamics can be used to design Graph Neural Networks. Opinion dynamics describe some hypothesized laws that humans might apply when exchanging opinions with others in a social network. GNNs are a class of neural architectures for the sake of capturing graph signals and make accurate predictions. I can clearly see that both of them are passing messages on the graph structure, with each node aggregating information from neighboring nodes in each iteration. However, the high-level similarity in their working mechanism does not explain why GNNs should do message passing following the way how humans exchange opinions. \n\n2. Eq. (6) (7) requires O(n^2) complexity to compute in each iteration of message passing, which abandons one of the most important characteristics of GNNs in leverage graph sparsity. Can the authors justify why this is a good choice, as well as the numerical comparison of ODNet's time complexity with other baselines?\n\n3. The baselines used in experiments are outdated. Most GNN architectures are at least 3-5 years ago.\n\n4. The readability of some key parts of the paper is extremely concerning. I find it very hard to understand, for example, the second paragraph on page 2 (\"The opinion dynamics-inspired ...\") and the paragraph of \"Clustering and Oversmoothing in Herterophilious Dynamics\" on page 4. Can the authors explain these two paragraphs in simpler language? For the former, why do microbial communities and metabolic genes suddenly appear in the context of social networks and opinion dynamics; for the latter, are the authors claiming that HK model does better on oversmoothing? I am extremely confused why so many things, \"clustering\", \"oversmoothing\", \"heterophily\", and \"dirichlet energy\", all show up together when none of them has been mentioned or eve hinted in the previous paragraph."

The authors then combine these dynamics with the Neural ODE paper to train the parameters of the resulting model. The authors report improvement over node prediction tasks, and other tasks over baseline GNNs.\n\nA key contribution of the paper is the design of the phi function which can incorporate homophily and heterophily. However they also introduce two new parameters. While their significance has been explained, how to set those parameters is still not intuitively clear. Specifically, on an unknown graph we may not have any idea about the nature of interactions that led to the graph.\n\nAnother contribution seems to be the integration of the whole model into the neural ODE framework for learning. However, the authors assume familiarity of the reader with this framework. It is very difficult judge the added complexity due to this addition. The authors also do not report training times and depth to which these networks and baseline models can be trained. Also, what about other GNN tasks e.g. link-prediction.\n\nThe author should also compare and contrast the role of other literature on learning of opinion dynamics models using neural networks:\nOkawa, Maya, and Tomoharu Iwata. \"Predicting opinion dynamics via sociologically-informed neural networks.\" In Proceedings of the 28th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1306-1316. 2022."
