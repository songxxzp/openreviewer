The relevant derivations in the paper are also straightforward.\n2. The paper studies the effect of an adaptive multivariate Gaussian noise schedule on the likelihood estimation performance, which can be potentially combined with other techniques to improve the metric. The proposed method, MULAN, is also found advantageous to previous SOTA generative modeling methods in likelihood estimation and convergence. The ablation study underscores the indispensable synergy between the method's core components: the auxiliary variable and the multivariate Gaussian noise scheduling."

                "value": "1. The intuition behind using a non-identical pixel-wise Gaussian noise schedule from a frequency perspective (e.g., texture and shape, which are mainly perceptual) is not convincing. It is known that likelihood generally does not correlate with sample quality and visual appearance [1].\n2. As mentioned in the paper, the proposed method itself does not contain much novelty. The use of multivariate non-isotropic Gaussian noise scheduling and the introduction of an auxiliary variable in diffusion models are not new [2][3]. The mathematical derivations presented in this paper largely mirror previous work.\n3. The introduction of an auxiliary variable does not necessarily agree with the objective of narrowing the posterior gap. In Section 3.3.2, the right-hand side of the first inequality, i.e., Equation (7), to my understanding, is the same as the ELBO of a variational autoencoder. If the actual objective of MULAN is based on the second inequality, then the ELBO w.r.t. $(x, z)$ would act as a bottleneck of the ELBO w.r.t. $(x_0, x_{1..T}, z)$.\n4. The experiment results are rather not impressive. As mentioned in the paper, the authors implement their method based on the VDM codebase and adopt the same settings for the most part. VDM is almost the strongest model excluding i-DODE and MULAN (this work) in the main table (Table 1). Although the improvement of the proposed method seems significant compared with other methods, it is far less impressive relative to the result by VDM (the method it is built upon), considering the extra degrees of freedom.\n5.

I think the variance of stochastic VLB matters in this case when it is used to compare the proposed method with others including VDM. VDM explicitly minimizes VLB variance with a learned noise schedule whereas MULAN does not. \n2. Does the authors try to analyze the auxiliary context variables? Do they have interpretable meaning? If so, it might also be a way to do representation learning and controllable generation.

It would be helpful to understand the significance of these variables in enhancing the likelihood. Although the authors have provided ablation studies for MuLAN without multivariate aspects, it's uncertain whether this is directly comparable to VDM with an auxiliary variable due to possible differences in noise schedule parameterization.\n\n* The authors justify the learning of noise schedules based on the manual adjustment of such schedules in high-resolution image diffusion models. Yet, they focus on maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) for their learning method, while current diffusion models tend to optimize a different objective that emphasizes perceptual quality of samples. Whether their method is applicable or beneficial when the goal is not ELBO is not clear.\n\n* Additionally, the discussion of related works could be more comprehensive. The paper frequently refers to continuous-time diffusion models but often overlooks citation [1], from which such models originate. The authors could provide a more thorough background for readers by acknowledging concurrent works [2] and [3], which propose the same ELBO for continuous-time diffusion models.
