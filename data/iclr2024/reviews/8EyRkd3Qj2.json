The primary objective of this task is to reconstruct or impute the missing modalities for each client without access to the raw data. To address this problem, the authors propose a method named \"Collaborative Adaptation\" (CLAP), which encompasses two distinct training stages within each client: Modality Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) and Client-Adaptation Variational Autoencoder (CA-VAE). The authors provide empirical evidence showcasing the efficacy of their proposed approach on various datasets, underscoring its ability to effectively address the challenges posed by checkerboard learning."

To impute the incomplete checkerboard, this paper proposes CA-VAE to model the relationships between modalities based on the the assumption that not all modalities are isolated modalities. For the statistical heterogeneity, this paper proposes Pareto Min-Max optimization to balance the performance of all combinations.\n3. This paper offers empirical validation of the proposed methodology through a series of experiments. These experiments encompass MNIST datasets, other benckmark datasets and eICU.

The proposed framework CLAP to tackle this problem consists of modality VAEs and client-adaptation VAEs.

In the proposed new task, the missing modalities are not only invisible during testing, but also unavailable during training, making the checkerboard learning a much more challenging and practical problem.\n3. The proposed method is concise and effective. The method is developed based on a comprehensive study of the checkerboard learning problem, wherein the challenges can be concluded into two aspects: statistical heterogeneity and modality combination heterogeneity among clients. The authors employ the Pareto min-max framework to address the aforementioned heterogeneity, which proves to be fundamentally valid.\n4.

They also perform experiments on a real-world clinical dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in practice."
