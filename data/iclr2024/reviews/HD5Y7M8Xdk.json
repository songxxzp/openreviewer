Eq. 8 and 11). This theoretical trade-off turned out to be beneficial in the experiments."

In particular, the distribution of the hidden variable has multiple modes, which seems impossible to be identified only with the binary visible variable. This observation also explains well that despite the fact that the conventional VI substantially failed to estimate the modes, there is only a tiny difference in log-likelihood compared to other methods (order of 1e-4, see Fig. 2a). So, the question is, **why do you compare the parameter convergence, HLL and CLL**, which I think are meaningful to compare only if the model is identifiable? A similar argument also applies to the synthetic experiment of spike NN."

To tackle the maximization of loglikelihood, the paper proposes variational importance sampling (VIS), which maximizes the marginal directly via importance sampling. Upon inspecting the variance of the IS estimator, the paper also proposes minimizing the chi-squared divergence w.r.t. the approximate posterior. \n\nThe paper inspects the efficacy of this method on a series of latent variable models, and witness a consistent improvement on the inference of latent variable models."

I agree with the authors that the mismatch should be inspected more carefully, and that one should separate the approximate posterior inference with the model itself. \n- Methodology: the paper proposes a simple, yet elegant solution to the question of likelihood maximization, and motivate the reasoning behind the optimization of the chi-squared divergence from the perspective of the bias and variance of the IS estimator. This approach seems novel, even though I am not very up-to-date about the research in this regard. \n- Experiments: the paper compares against alternative options in latent variable inference and showcase that the method can correctly infer the marginal likelihood, as well as outperforming competing methods in real-world datasets."
