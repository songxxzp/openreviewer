Such chains of queries can be specified as *sketches*: natural-language prompts that contain *holes* that the LLM is meant to fill in. Each hole is associated with a stopping phrase, and a natural way to read the sketch is as specifying an interaction pattern, where we alternate between (1) deterministically extending an LLM's context window with the next (non-hole) chunk of the sketch, and (2) allowing the LLM to fill in the value of a hole by sampling tokens freely until it emits the stopping phrase for that hole. Because LLMs are autoregressive, this interaction pattern does not allow the LLM propose values for the holes in a way that is *aware* of future interactions in the sketch. To alleviate this problem somewhat, the paper presents two new decoding algorithms (variants of beam search) that optimize the joint log probability of the entire LLM context. On several benchmark tasks, the paper compares the zero-shot performance of LLMs with standard prompts + standard decoding algorithms, vs. with particular prompt sketches and the new proposed decoding algorithms."

The variants of beam search that the paper introduces are largely sensible, and overcome the key barriers to performing beam search in the multi-variable setting\u2014namely, the fact that beams with the same number of tokens may be at different stages of the sketch, making their scores difficult to compare fairly.\n\n* Results are reported both for open models and closed (OpenAI) models. Many souped-up decoding methods require information that is not available through the OpenAI APIs, and it's nice that the authors have shown that a version of their approach (at least for small beam sizes) *can* be implemented atop the user-facing API (at least for text-davinci-003)."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* I couldn't quite follow the motivation: what problem with existing decoding techniques is prompt sketching meant to address? Figure 1 comes closest to illustrating the problem, but it was not particularly compelling. (I am not sure which model was used to generate Figure 1, but I tried copying the prompt and constraint into text-davinci-003 and it had no trouble following the constraint.) To be sure, there are many sketches that I am sure GPT-3 would often fail to follow, even if the sketch were included in the prompt; you can encode arbitrarily difficult infilling problems into sketches. But the sketches presented in this paper are enforcing very simple formatting constraints on, e.g., the list of thoughts generated for a chain-of-thought prompt. What failure modes do you see when just explaining to the model that it should follow the desired format (e.g. by pasting the sketch into the context)? Do failures to follow the format cause failures in reasoning? How exactly do VAR and BEAM_VAR address these failures? (Can they really be doing much, at a beam size of only n=2?)\n\n\n* The experiments provide somewhat weak evidence for the value of the new decoding methods. In different tasks, it often seems to be the case that *one* of the methods outperforms an argmax baseline, whereas the *other* method underperforms the baseline, and which method wins varies from task to task. Even when the new decoding methods provide a modest advantage over argmax decoding, it is not clear whether the advantage is worth the added computational cost (or dollar cost, for OpenAI models).\n\n\n* I am not convinced the experimental setup is completely debugged. For example, in chain-of-thought for the \"date understanding\" task, a period is used as the stopping phrase for each thought. However, periods show up frequently in dates (e.g., \"Sept. 1\"), and this stopping-phrase is clearly causing the model to cut off thoughts early (page 21). Some experimental settings are also missing details; e.g., in the single-variable chain-of-thought prompts, it is unclear when the [COT] variable ends -- I did not see a stopping phrase reported.\n\n\n* Some of the algorithmic choices in VAR / BEAM_VAR were not sufficiently justified, and struck me as slightly odd. For example, the VAR algorithm shrinks the n^2 generations for a variable back down to a beam width of n *before* adding the next deterministic chunk. But I thought a key point of these algorithms was to enable the next deterministic chunk to provide a \"score\" for the proposed variable values; wouldn't it make more sense to rank all n^2 variable proposals by how well they fit with the next deterministic chunk, scale back down to n, and then generate proposals for the next variable?"
