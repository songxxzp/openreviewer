There are finite weighted graphs which are *not* similarly representable if using a euclidean distance\n3. the depth and hidden width of the MLP depends favourably on the number of nodes and embedding dimensions (order $(n\\log n)^{1.5}$ and linearly, respectively)\n4. For specific graphs (e.g. trees) even more favourable guarantees are possible\n\nThe method is evaluated on Cora, CiteSeer (standard GNN benchmarks) and Tadpole and Aerothermodynamics (used in the paper which introduced the latent graph approach.)"

This is demonstrated theoretically via Theorems 1-2, with particular examples provided to motivate a learnable, non-Riemannian metric. This is also demonstrated empirically with a comprehensive comparison to alternative latent graph inference methods which use more typical metrics, clearly outperforming these baselines in some cases, and performing competitively in others."

The universal representation power in conjunction with the fact that the model provably needs not to use a large number of parameters is a very strong theoretical result.\n\nOverall, this is a very well-written and convincing work. While I am not entirely knowledgeable on the topic of latent graph inference, I think that the theoretical and empirical arguments of the authors provide a very clear explanation of the novelty of their approach and how it fits in the context of the current state of the field."
