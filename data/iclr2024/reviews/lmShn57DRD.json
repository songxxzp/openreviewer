                "value": "This paper delves into the challenges presented by multivariate long-term time series forecasting (MLTSF), specifically the difficulty of capturing cross-channel dependencies and temporal order information using current Transformer-based models. Despite the achievements of Transformer models in various fields, their application in MLTSF reveals certain inadequacies. Models like Informer, Autoformer, and FEDformer, while advanced, still face challenges in understanding intricate channel relationships in multivariate time series. \n\nTo address these issues, the authors propose the GRformer model. This innovative solution combines the strengths of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and position encoding derived from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The inclusion of a mix-hop propagation layer within a feedforward neural network promotes efficient interaction between different time series data points. Additionally, by leveraging a multi-layer RNN, the model recursively generates positional embeddings, emphasizing the importance of sequence order. \n\nThe paper's empirical tests, conducted on eight real-world datasets, demonstrate the GRformer's superior predictive accuracy in MLTSF tasks, underlining its potential as a novel solution in the field of time series forecasting."

The authors propose a hybrid architecture that consists of a Transformer-based graph neural network to model cross-channel dependencies and a recurrent neural network to model temporal dependencies. The proposed model shows promising performance on eight benchmarks. However, the motivation and reasoning behind the criticism of the Transformer-based approach are difficult to understand. Some of the claims are made without proper evidence, or by simply citing previous work, without providing any further detailed study or analysis. Additionally, the performance improvements on the benchmarks seem to outperform the baselines. However, I believe the claim of achieving a performance improvement with a 5.7% decrease in MSE and 6.1% decrease in MAE is misleading. These numbers are calculated by averaging MSE and MAE without considering the scales between different benchmarks and metrics. ILI has much higher mean squared errors (MSEs) and mean absolute errors (MAEs) than other benchmarks. This means that if you compute the average score in this way, the average score can be dominated by the relative improvement in this specific dataset. The tone reporting the improvement suggests that the model showed around a 6% decrease in errors on all benchmarks, but the average relative improvement for each benchmark at different metrics is actually 2.55% for MSE and 4.96% for MAE."
