The approach is not compared with these approaches neither experimentally not even theoretically. \n\nExperiments in the noiseless regime do not compare Boolformer with any baseline (therefore is quite hard to understand how hard is the task overall). \n\nExperiments in the noisy regime have comparisons but with very unrelated approaches (generic ML models or specific to the dataset)\n\nMinor: The numbers in the radar charts in Figure 7 are impossible to read."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The problem statement in the introduction does not match the solution. In Section 1, citing (Abbe et al., 2022), the authors point out that Transformer learns complex models in terms of the Fourier spectrum, resulting in poor generalization performance when samples are insufficient. As a contribution, Section 1.1 claims that it is robust to noisy and incomplete observations. However, the Boolformer proposed in this paper is a relatively natural application of the Transformer, and there is no redesign from a Fourier spectrum perspective or other robustness innovations.\n- Due to the design of the method, it can only accept datasets with relatively few variables or small scale. This is acknowledged by the authors in section 5, but since there are currently proposals such as Transformer that can accept long series, it would have been easy to consider improving the limitation.\n- For example, if the correct answer is [AND, X_1, NOT, X_2], then [AND, NOT, X_2, X_1] is also equivalent. The fact that the system is learned by cross-entropy means that it is unclear how a valid cross-entropy can be calculated when there are multiple correct answers in this way."

If the radar chart is used to make comparisons between methods, it would be better to have as many axes as the number of experimental settings, such as the number of genes, and plot entities for each method. Alternatively, a table or a bar chart like Figure 7(b) is easier to compare methods.\n- Minor comments:\n  - In the caption of Figure 1, (x_5 x_6 x_7 x_7 x_9( should be (x_5 x_6 x_7 x_**8** x_9).\n  - References should be corrected. Especially, many published papers are cited as preprints. Below are some examples:\n    - The reference for (Abbe et al., 2022) should be a NeurIPS 2022 paper.\n    - (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) should be an ICLR 2021 paper."
