It seems more likely that these are novel problems generated by the LLM, based on general statistical knowledge. I don't think this really undermines the usefulness of the approach, but it might be worthwhile to briefly discuss this issue.\n- The caption for Table 1 mentions that an in-context demonstration was used for the davinci models, but I couldn't find any explanation of this description (e.g., does this include an in-context training example, or merely a demonstration of the formatting?). \n\nMinor comments:\n- The authors might consider citing work that analyzes the analogical reasoning ability of LLMs [1,2] (though I should note that I don't think this undermines the contribution of the present work). There are also a few references that would be good to include when introducing the general concept of analogical reasoning and its role in the psychology literature [3,4].\n\n[1] Webb, T., Holyoak, K.
