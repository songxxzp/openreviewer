In the end, the authors demonstrated a tradeoff between perception quality and mode collapsing, which was affected by the effect of the cost term in the loss function, and proposed a new training scheme by controlling this term during training."

In theorem 3.1, the authors prove the existence and uniqueness of the UOTM model.

                "value": "The paper suffers from three main weaknesses that, together, make me believe that it remains under the acceptance threshold. I look forward to discussing with the authors and other reviewers on this topic.\n\n### Significance of the Proposed Framework\n\nAs it is described in Algorithm 1, the proposed framework is a useful framework for exposition and experimental design, but the significance of this contribution is limited.\n- It is a straightforward generalization of the already established lookalike adversarial objectives of Equations 4 and 5. This kind of framework is common in the GAN literature, e.g. in Nagarajan et al. (2017).\n- The unified algorithm is not by itself the source of novel insights, or novel models. The proposed UOTM-SD does not necessitate this unified algorithm as it only interpolates between two OT map models using Equation (12).\n\nNagarajan et al. Gradient descent GAN optimization is locally stable. NIPS 2017.\n\n### Weak Experiments\n\nThe experiments only weakly support the claims of the paper.\n- The convergence and mode collapse properties are mainly studied in Section 3.2 on a toy dataset. Yet, the difference between low and high dimensions can be large when dealing with neural networks. Considering a higher-dimensional structured dataset could strengthen the experimental conclusions. Additionally, I would also suggest including another low-dimensional dataset to avoid any bias linked to having a data distribution evenly distributed around the prior distribution.\n- Still on Section 3.2, the experiments lack a vanilla GAN baseline, especially to conclude on advantage of the SP function. Similarly, experiments of Figures 5 and 6 miss the WGAN-GP baseline.\n- As a standalone model and with the available information, the comparative advantage of UOTM-SD is not significant enough. The gain in FID is minor and would thus require confidence intervals to be validated. The FID being computed on the training set, there is also a risk of overfitting to be taken into account. Furthermore, other datasets might be considered to test the robustness of the methods to other modalities and data dimensions.\n\n### Possible Bias against OT Loss Models (GANs)\n\nGenerators in GANs do not require their latent space to be of the same dimension as their output. Yet, it seems to be the case for OT map models, given that they learn a transport map between two distributions living in the same space. I would suggest the authors to explicitly explain how this affects their experiments and their results. Are the provided comparisons fair between the two types of models, in terms of dimensionality and neural network architectures? Both operation modes seem hard to articulate with each other, as Algorithm 1 features the sampling of both a random variable from the same space as the data and another latent variable to accommodate the two types of models.\n\nMoreover, the authors should further the comment why the Lipschitzness result of Theorem 3.1 is an advantage over GANs. WGAN(-GP) also requires Lipschitz solutions, and the Lipschitzness constraint is even applied to other GAN models nowadays.\n\n### Remarks on the Form\n\n- The references of Fan et al. and Rout et al. miss a year.\n- Some notations are not defined, like $\\Pi(\\mu, \\nu)$ and $D_{\\psi_i}$ in Section 2.\n- Differentials $d$ in integrals should be upright for better readability.\n- Abbreviations of \"Equation\" should end with a point: \"Eq.\".\n- Equations 4 and 5 are not learning objectives but optima of learning objective. The correct way to present them is in Algorithm 1.\n- The color scheme of Figure 5 should be adjusted for a better readability in grayscale.\n- Some space should be added between images and captions in Figure 4."

                "value": "OT has been widely explored in generative modeling from diverse perspectives (e.g., OT loss and OT map). However, interpretation and understanding of the pros and cons of OT are underexplored.  In this paper, the authors are proposing a framework generalizing the existing OT-based generative models and additionally propose a scheduling method to mitigate the drawback of the cost function derived from OT. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses and experiments are reported."

It would be much easier to read if one or two lines of descriptions comparing each term and notation with those of the regular GAN setup were provided.\n- The analysis is good, but the benefit of the proposed method (UOTM-SD) is not clearly shown.\n- Experiments are limited to low-dimensional datasets which is not practical enough.\n- Some parts are not clear which are described in the Questions below."

                "value": "1. Is the analysis valid in relatively higher-dimensional data (e.g., 128^2 or 256^2) such as  CelebA or FFHQ, CUB, or ImageNet?\n2. (Alg. 1) What is $X$ in line 3? I would assume $Y$ is from real data and $z$ is from the prior known distribution, e.g., Gaussian. Similarly, $T_\\theta$ is consistently taking $x$ as input throughout Equations in the paper while $x$ and $z$ are taken as input in the algorithm (line 4). For example, in Eq. 5, I can see that $x$ is a prior distribution $y$ is a real distribution and the OT term $c$ is applied in between the Gaussian and the generated samples, which I believe is different from the Algorithm.\n3. (page 6, \u201cEffect of Cost in Mode Collapse\u201d) It is not straightforward how the cost function actually helps the mode coverage. \n4. Why the results in Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 are different?\n5. Performance of UOTM-SD in the toy dataset? and Qualitative comparison results in Cifar10 (UOTM-SD v.s. UOTM)?"
