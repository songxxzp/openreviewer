In essence, this paper introduces a method for template prediction. However, it still faces challenges with generalization. If a template from the test set isn't present in the training set, its associated leaving groups won't be linked by hyperedges within the hypergraph. Consequently, when employing a search limited by a one-hop constraint, searching the relevant leaving groups becomes challenging.\n\n3. While extracting leaving groups from the training set poses generalization challenges, a more effective method involves constructing leaving groups directly from the molecules.\n\n4. Using reinforcement learning might be superfluous. I suggest modeling the search for the reaction center and leaving groups as an autoregressive problem.\n\n5. Evaluating performance on the USPTO-50K dataset, which mostly contains reactions with a single reaction center, doesn't convincingly show that the introduced method can handle cases with multiple reaction centers. A recent study by FusionRetro[1] proposed a dataset from USPTO-full for retrosynthetic planning, where approximately 30% of the reactions have several reaction centers. Both G2Gs[2] and GraphRetro[3] demonstrate subpar performance on this dataset, primarily because they struggle with multi-reaction-center scenarios. I want to know the performance of RetroSiG on this dataset to validate its effectiveness in handling multi-reaction-center reactions.\n\n[1] FusionRetro: Molecule Representation Fusion via In-Context Learning for Retrosynthetic Planning, ICML 2023.  \n[2] A graph to graphs framework for retrosynthesis prediction, ICML 2020.  \n[3] Learning graph models for retrosynthesis prediction.

The method leverages the hypergraph to capture implicit dependencies between leaving groups and incorporates a one-hop constraint to reduce the search space and improve performance. The paper includes comprehensive experiments demonstrating RetroSiG's competitive performance in predicting complex reactions. Ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of individual components, such as the one-hop constraint and the leaving group hypergraph.

This integration aims to overcome the limitations of existing methods in predicting complex reactions with multiple reaction centers or the attachment of the same leaving group to multiple atoms.

The significance of the paper lies in its attempt to address the limitations of existing methods in predicting complex reactions in retrosynthesis. By proposing RetroSiG, which combines various techniques and incorporates a one-hop constraint, the paper aims to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of retrosynthesis prediction. Experiments validated the claims, that RetroSiG has practical implications in the field of organic synthesis and contributes to the development of more effective methods for predicting reactants."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "(W1): Several parts of the method are either not clear to me, or they are clear but I am not sure if they are necessary. \n\n- (a) How does RetroSiG choose where the leaving groups are attached in the graph, and also how many times each group is used? The action space used by the hypergraph agent suggests each node (leaving group) is only chosen once, so the count of how many it is applied has to be selected separately. \n\n- (b) The authors mention that the final prediction is produced by assembling a template and applying it, but that this is more efficient than template application in template-based models as the location where the template should be applied is known. How is the template application carried out technically? Initially I assumed it's through a standard library e.g. rdkit or rchiral, but normally those would try to match the template in all places. How do you restrict the matching to only consider the predicted reaction centre? \n\n- (c) Are the only rewards received by the RL agents coming from choosing the right set of atoms/nodes at the end? If so, why is RL needed at all? It seems one could just sample a possible correct sequence of actions (or several such sequences) and supervise the model directly, as done in e.g. MEGAN or models for molecular graph generation [1]. \n\n- (d) Is using a hypergraph for the leaving groups necessary, as opposed to just using a plain graph where two leaving groups are connected if they co-occur (as a pair) in the training set? As far as I understand, the allowed actions would be the same, as such a graph would have the same connectivity as the hypergraph; however, the encoder would be different (GNN vs Hypergraph GNN), so maybe it would make some difference in performance. \n\n- (e) How is reaction centre defined? It may sometimes be the case that the set of bond changes is not a connected subgraph, hence the atoms with changing neighborhood may also not form a connected set of vertices. In those cases, standard template extraction algorithms might extract a template with several \"connected components\". However, as I understand RetroSiG assumes the set of nodes in the reaction centre is connected, so perhaps the definition is different than \"nodes for which neighborhood changed\"? \n\n- (f) Is the second step (leaving group identification) not conditioned on the choices made in the first step in any way? \n\n(W2): Empirical performance as shown in Table 2 is promising, but some further comparison would help to really determine where the proposed method shines. \n\n- (a) I like how the authors isolate a \"complex subset\" where the reaction centre has more than 2 atoms, even though on USPTO-50K this unfortunately leaves very few samples. However, the authors only run RetroSiG on that subset, and do not run the other baseline models. I think it would be informative to compare with other models and see if e.g. RetroSiG starts outperforming some models it was losing to on the full dataset. \n\n- (b) Further from the above, the tiny size of the \"complex subset\" in USPTO-50K again points at the fact that this dataset is relatively simple, and thus a method designed to e.g. better deal with larger reaction centres or more complex leaving group patterns may not show its full potential. It would therefore be good to e.g. run comparison on a larger version of USPTO like USPTO-MIT. One could even repeat the same \"complex subset\" selection on the larger dataset for another comparison. This would be helpful to understand if RetroSiG really is more adept at dealing with more complex reactions. \n\n- (c) Some SotA approaches are missing: RetroKNN [2] on the template-based side, and RootAligned [3] on the template-free side. \n \n\n=== Other comments === \n\n(O1): There are several caveats that can distort accuracies in reaction prediction; the authors note one of them (careful atom mapping removal to avoid data leakage) but there are other subtleties (e.g. output deduplication) which could be taken into account. See [4] for best practices on this; it would be good to verify that RetroSiG followed these, as [4] shows prior works often did not and that distorted some of the numbers. \n\n(O2): Section 4.5 points to Figure 4a for an example of attaching the same leaving group to more than one atom, yet in the figure I can see the group only attached once. Am I misunderstanding something here or is there an error in the figure? \n\n(O3): Next to Equation 1 there is some text about what happens when T = 0. Why does one have to consider such a case? Does this mean the sequence of edits is an empty sequence i.e. product and reactants are the same? \n\n \n\n=== Nitpicks === \n\nBelow I list nitpicks (e.g. typos, grammar errors), which did not have a significant impact on my review score, but it would be good to fix those to improve the paper further. \n\n- Most citations seem to lack parentheses; this form of citation should only be used for citations that are part of text (e.g. \"Anon et al proposed...\" but not for citations that are outside of text \"Some models (Anon et al) compute...\"). Please check the use of `\\cite` vs `\\citet` vs `\\citep` commands. \n\n- \"we propose,\" (two places) -> I would not put a comma here \n\n- \"RetroSiG has several advantages as a semi-template-based method:  First\" -> I would just put a period instead of a colon here \n\n- \"RretroSiG\" \n\n- \"raction center\" \n\n- \"It has the capability to predicting\" -> \"to predict\" \n\n- \"can be factorized to\" -> \"into\" \n\n- \"However, It cannot predict\" -> lowercase \"it\" \n\n- \"from the first-order neighbour\" -> \"neighbours\" \n\n- \"As is shown in Fig. 3a, Most\" -> lowercase \"most\" \n\n- The ICLR LaTeX guidelines are to remove most horizontal lines from tables, so I would do that in Table 2. Maybe leave only those separating the different groups. \n\n- Ablation study points to Figure 3, but I think it should point to Table 3 \n\n- Figure 4 says \"ground-truth product\" but I think it should say \"ground-truth reactants\" \n\n \n\n=== References === \n\n[1] \"Learning to Extend Molecular Scaffolds with Structural Motifs\" \n\n[2] \"Retrosynthesis Prediction with Local Template Retrieval\" \n\n[3] \"Root-aligned SMILES: A Tight Representation for Chemical Reaction Prediction\" \n\n[4] \"Re-evaluating Retrosynthesis Algorithms with Syntheseus\""
