                "value": "This paper proposed a pipeline framework for improving the accuracy of LVLMs in VQA tasks.\nFirst, details are identified from the question and the image, including entities (using off-the-shelf tools) and rationales (using the LVLM), which are then used to obtain related details from the image (using the LVLM), and descriptions from the image (using the LVLM).\nSecond, the details are fused with the question, generating multiple question candidates (using the LVLM), the results of which are filtered to exclude semantically inconsistent ones (using off-the-shelf tools).\nFinally, the LVLM answers each candidate question; the final answer is selected using the LVLM with the confidence-based method.\n\nOn two benchmark sets, i.e., VQAv2 and A-OKVQA, solid improvements are shown on 3 LVLMs. The with/without kind of ablation is conducted suggesting each element in the pipeline contributes to the improvement. Further analyses are conducted to try to show that the new questions are effective because of less underspecification and ambiguity, i.e., because of the added details that are obvious for humans but not quite so for LVLMs. The asymmetric strength hypothesis seems to suggest that the visual components alone are not quite up to the job of the VQA task."

This is very important because the proposed pipeline is complicated and not easily reproducible."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The pipeline seems overcomplicated and involves many steps that are indispensable to the overall performance. Unlike plain CoT, which usually conducts inference once, the proposed pipeline conducts inference multiple times using the LVLM and involves off-the-shelf tools twice. The complexity may affect the reproduction of the method and the incurred (computation and time) cost may hinder the adoption of the method in application.\n- The main results (Table 1) need more explanation. (1) For example, the standard deviation considering the oracle implementation is high. I did not expect that using the optimal candidate would lead to higher variance. Are there results regarding the choice of the number of the question candidates? (2) I would love to see more QA datasets (from diverse sources) tested on. (3) I wonder if the asymmetric strength hypothesis holds, is it possible that stage 2 and stage 3 can be changed to using the original question and the extracted details in texts without the image? (4) All analyses are based on BLIP-2, an encoder-decoder model. I don't think I find a discussion on the effect of model architecture (encoder-decoder or decoder-only).\n- The writing and the organization can be improved. Personally, I would like Section 3 Methodology to be more straightforward. From what I understand, Stage I (ii) adopts different post-processing from (i) and (iii). The paragraph before Section 3.2 states \"we prompt the LVLM to answer each question\" and the first paragraph in Section 3.2 states \"To select which question to answer\", which are contradictory. I had to check the appendix and the footnotes multiple times to guess what's going on."
