The authors consider two settings: (1) the network has multiple inputs each with a potentially different group acting on it, and (2) the network has a single input and the group acting on it is a large product group. For the former the authors consider linear formulations and characterize the entire space of linear equivariant layers. They then use the obtained equations to extend to non-linear models and show that there exist a design that is universal in approximating invariant-symmetric functions. For the second setting, they propose a method that is more efficient than existing works, at the cost of decreased expressivity."

In particular, this paper tackles the setting in which the group can be decomposed as a product group. This leads to two principal tasks: 1.) the multi-input setting in which each group in the product acts on its respect input and 2.) the single input setting but the symmetry on this data type has a product structure. For the first setting, the authors propose IS fusion layer and characterize the entire space of linear equivariant functions with multiple inputs. They then extend this to the non-linear setting and prove universal approximation capabilities. Experiments are conducted in both settings and include multi-image classification and downstream applications of compositional generalization and language. The proposed approach is sometimes competitive with previous approaches but has the benefit of linear computational complexity w.r.t. to the number of groups."

First, the paper builds upon two recent papers by Basu et. al 2023 and Kim et. al 2023. and this allows the paper to lean on existing methodology. Thus the overall idea is relatively straightforward to understand. Moreover, the presented theory can be understood equally easily as it largely follows from the author's definitions and results in Maron et. al 2020."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Despite the stated strengths above; I have strong reservations regarding this paper. The first one is on the motivation. It is unclear to me why we would want to make an existing trained model equivariant. This is certainly the assumption in the downstream language experiments, but this is not at all a convincing demonstration. The task is contrived and does not fit in the broader equivariant literature.\n\n**Large discrete product groups?**\n\nIn addition, to the lack of coherent motivation, I also found the claims in the paper to be unsupported. A large theme of this work is on building equivariance across **large discrete** product groups. In the multi-input experiments (Table 1) you have $N=4$ and the $C_4$ group. This is not a large product or large individual group. Similarly, in the compositional generalization experiment you write \"The product groups are made of three smaller each of size two, and the largest product group considered is of size eight\". Again this is not a large product group. A similar criticism can be attributed to the intersectional fairness experiments. So I find the entire claim and motivation for doing this work lacking. In fact, I would argue that you can just as easily do frame averaging and canonicalization in these settings. Thus at **minimum** these should be baselines. \n\n**Experimental design and results**\nThe entire choice of experiments in this paper leans heavily on Basu et. al 2023's results. But I don't think the authors thought that the experimental setup in that paper might also be problematic in terms of highlighting the claims and goals. First, there is really no standard equivariant benchmark from many of the seminal equivariant papers. For example, you could have considered molecular datasets where you have $S_n$ and $SE(3)$. $S_n$ would be a much larger discrete group and you could consider discrete subgroups of $SE(3)$. Given the large literature of equivariant models in this space, the lack of this benchmark is alarming. In addition, if you really want to show discrete product group structure then there is a large body of work on latent space disentanglement via Linear symmetries which started from the seminal work of (Higgins et. al 2018). Completely ignoring this line of work and its benchmarks which are almost tailor-made to the setting considered in this work is questionable. Finally, I find the choice of compositional generalization and intersectional fairness via group theoretic notions quite a contrived task that runs counter to the actual practical goal of this work which is to scale up equivariant models for product groups.\n\nWith regard to results, there are many areas of improvement. To start off, the proposed approach does worse than equitune in some experiments (e.g. Fig 2). The authors do not have a convincing argument on why this is acceptable outside that their proposed approach has better-scaling properties w.r.t. to the number of groups in the product. Unfortunately, as I stated above this is not a large product so this is weird. Secondly, obvious baselines are missing. These include having an actual equivariant (architecture) model that is trained (not fine-tuned) post hoc in this manner. Also, frame averaging and canonicalization should be included."

                "value": "Please consider adding the following experiments.\n\n1.) An experiment where $S_n$ is in the product. This can be a molecular task or not, but the equivariant literature has many examples of benchmarks.\n\n2.) Adding an experiment with latent product symmetry. This would be a really convincing and better experiment in your setting.\n\n3.) Can you please add the baselines mentioned in the weakness section?\n\n4.) Can you please highlight the computational cost (iters/sec, flops, training time, inference time, etc...) of your approach versus frame averaging for your tasks. My guess is that it is quite similar given how small the group is."
