                "value": "This paper introduces the Gaunt Tensor Product, an efficient method to compute the tensor products of (high-degree) irreps as compared to the widely-used Clebsch-Gordan (CG) product. This is established through the connection between CG coefficients and Gaunt coefficients via the Wigner-Eckart theorem, and this connection implies that tensor product can be equivalently represented as multiplication of spherical functions. Through convolution theorem and FFT, the computational cost has been reduced from $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^3)$, where $L$ is the highest-degree of the irreps."

The experimental evaluations comparing the proposed tensor product with the conventionally employed CG product are both extensive and convincing."

                "value": "1. One point of critique is related to the treatment of Theorem 3.1 in the manuscript. The text uses a range of specialized terms\u2014such as \"spherical tensor operator,\" \"reduced matrix element,\" and \"total angular momentum\"\u2014and introduces various notations that may not be readily accessible to readers unfamiliar with quantum mechanics. To enhance clarity and comprehension, I recommend that the authors elaborate on these concepts, particularly in their exposition of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n\n2. Another inquiry concerns the necessity of using high-degree irreps. In most E3-NN architectures, irreps with degrees no greater than L=2 are commonly employed. Consequently, I question whether the computational overhead incurred through the FFT in implementing the proposed tensor product is actually more costly than directly using the CG product for low-degree irreps."
