Authors are recommended to consider providing a comparison of CALM with existing methods for ensembling model representations. Additionally, could the authors clarify \"LoRA assumes access to the full underlying domain data during pretraining\"? It is assumed that the same training data are used for both LoRA and CALM in Table 5.\n\n2. Missing Information on Overhead: The paper does not provide information on the additional parameters introduced and their ratio to the anchor and augmenting models, which is important to understand the system's overhead. It would also be helpful to support the claim that \"The composed model achieves similar performance for a tiny fraction of the training cost\" with evidence, such as the number of FLOPs and memory requirements. Since the framework requires backpropagation through the initial layers of both models, I assume that the training cost should be comparable to directly training $m_B$.\n\n3. The paper should include model configurations and training details to enhance reproducibility.\n\n4. Some notations are used before being formally introduced, leading to potential confusion. For instance, notation $\\mathbf{C}$ is introduced in Section 3.2 after being used from the beginning of Section 3.

It would be also interesting to explore the interactions between $m_B$ attending to $m_A$ in comparison to the current direction, to determine whether the capabilities of \"generic\" models can be effectively transferred to a \"specialized\" model, especially given that $m_A$ is more efficient to run.\n3. Table 3 shows more noticeable performance gains in high-resource languages compared to low-resource ones.
