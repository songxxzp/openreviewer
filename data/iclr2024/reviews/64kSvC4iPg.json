Here are the contributions:\n1. Extended the gisting technique to multi-context settings, and demonstrated the gains are better than naively adapting gisting to this setting. Further, the authors show that the proposed technique has very little gap with no compression, on three datasets.\n2. The authors also have proposed a parameter efficient method for training this mechanism, which doubles as a regularization. They also proposed an efficient way to train the model, by parallelizing the originally sequential context segments.\n3. Finally there are ablation studies on various design choices, such as the conditional adapter, the model architecture etc."

However, in figure 4, and the description of the parallelized training procedure, it's unclear how this could be done, as all the $Mem(\\*)$ are computed after $h(\\*)$, for the same layer. Do you condition $h(t)$ on the previous layer's $Mem(t - 1)$? If so please update the text to make it obvious.\n2. The motivation for the conditional adapter is to regularize against overfitting. The authors only reported the training loss of LLAMA 7B without context. To make it more clear on the overfitting situation, could you also report the loss with context, and the test performance with and without context.\n3. The masking doesn't seem to be autoregressive in figure 4b?\n4. Table 3 only has numbers on MetaICL. What about the other two datasets?\n5. In section 4.2, on different model architecture, have you tried non instruction tuned T5? From what I can tell, instruction following is not necessary for the three datasets used in the paper."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While this paper presents a seemingly promising solution to long contexts, I have significant concerns about several limitations.\n\nFirstly, one of the main focuses of this paper is handling dynamic context for interaction. Judging from its experimental design, it mainly conducts experiments with a fine-tuned LLM for few-shot learning scenarios, which are generally simpler tasks, all being multi-choice, or classification tasks. The methods primarily compared in this paper are general context compression or long context handling methods (general and generative tasks). This involves 3 issues. The first issue: for simpler tasks like classification, compression is relatively easy (this is why previous models were easily distilled but GPT was not; I believe it's not because GPT is hard to distill, but because GPT is not for a specific task, but a general model. The authors may better know what I said if reading the paper about information bottleneck: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02406.pdf). Therefore, it's not surprising that this method achieves good compression results (model size compression and context compression are similar, both reducing model capacity), but I believe it's hard for this paper's method and results to scale to general scenarios. At least in this paper, I didn't see any general tests to prove its compression effect. The second issue: for the few-shot learning setting, adding compression tokens after the demonstration makes sense, but for general scenarios, there is no definite boundary to limit compression tokens, making this method hard to generalize. Even if a compression token can be added every K tokens, this approach would lead to inefficient training, as a large amount of sampling is required to ensure the model learns well for each position. The third issue: the main setting of this paper is few-shot learning, and its main claim is online interaction. But for few-shot learning, there doesn't seem to be any online interaction. Users usually provide all demonstrations at once for the model to give an answer, and it's hard for me to imagine a setting where users incrementally provide demonstrations to the model.\n\nSecondly, for dialogue tasks, this is a context compression for a specific task (more preciesely, for a specific dataset). Similar to what I mentioned above, if it's for a specific task/benchmark, there is actually a lot of compression space, which has been discussed in many previous works, such as: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12726.pdf. For context compression of a specific task, even without this method, other methods should also achieve good compression results.\n\nThirdly, I am not entirely convinced by the results presented in the paper. For example, in Table 15, the performance of RMT is almost the same as that of No context, which is hard to believe. Moreover, Table 15 is an experiment conducted on OPT-2.7b. The few-shot learning ability of the 2.7b OPT model, as far as I understand, should be very weak, and changes in the order of sample arrangement will significantly affect the results. For a method like this paper's, which is similar to a recurrent method, it should be very easily influenced by later samples. Unfortunately, I didn't see any discussion about this.\n\nSome questions:\n1. Figure 4 is a little confusing. In (a), what do the blocks in different colors mean?\n2. It seems that this work uses 1 single 80GB A100 for training. Could the authors provide more details about the fine-tuning process?"

To engage the LLM to utilize such CCM, the parallel training and LoRA adapter are designed well for efficient adaptation.\n\n2. The CCM is efficient in both training and inference. Firstly, there is no need to re-compute the sentence embedding and instead caching the attention keys and values. Secondly, the memory storage cost, the compression ratio, and the algorithmic complexity all demonstrate the efficiency of the method. Thirdly, LoRA based adapter tuning brings a lot of efficiency in memory-engaged adaptation.\n\n2. The evaluation is comprehensive and diverse.

In terms of the baselines, in the main tables, CCM is only compared with \u201cno context\" and \"full context\" baselines on accuracy, which lacks sufficient comparison for demonstrating the effectiveness of the method. As least, the retrieval-based method should be considered as an important baseline and it is now the universally-adopted method for memory compression. If I understand the paper correctly, the token embedding produced by <COMP> token is the same as a sentence embedding. The author can follow MemoryBank for adopting retrieval-based method to compress the long-context during online interactions. Other baselines like LongMem and UnlimitedFormer can be also considered but not necessary."

Is it possible to add a weighted coefficient in terms of time steps for a weighted merge on all memory features, i.e. $$Softmax([1:t_i])\\in R^t$$? \n\n3.

Have the authors considered hybrid approaches that combine task-specific and task-agnostic components to mitigate this limitation? If so, what were the challenges or outcomes of these considerations?\n\n4. **Performance Gap Analysis**: The paper notes a clear performance gap between the compressed and full context models. Could the authors provide a more in-depth analysis or hypotheses as to why this gap exists? Are there particular types of data or tasks where this performance gap is more pronounced?\n\n5. **Basic Memory Update Functions**: The memory update functions in the proposed framework are described as basic. Could the authors provide examples or discussions on more sophisticated memory update mechanisms that could potentially enhance the framework\u2019s capabilities? What prevented the integration of these more advanced mechanisms in the current version of the framework?\n\n6. **Lack of Comparison to Recurrent Memory Approaches**: The comparison in the paper is mainly drawn with simple adaptations of fixed-context compression methods. Could the authors justify the choice of these particular baselines and discuss the reasons for not including a direct comparison with recurrent memory approaches, such as linear Transformers? How might the results differ with these additional comparisons?\n\n7. **Explaining Effectiveness of Compressed Context**: In relation to the performance gap, could the authors shed light on any specific scenarios or data types where the compressed context performs particularly well or poorly? Understanding these nuances could help in better positioning the framework and identifying areas for improvement."
