The proofs of propositions and lemmas are quite standard which mostly follow the existing approaches in literature. It would be more beneficial if the authors can clarify the unique aspects and advantages of their approach, and clearly differentiate it from existing methods.\nFurthermore, the authors only provide analysis for a two-view setting, which might not be completely satisfied with the proposed multi-view MI.\nThe paper does not present algorithms for federated training, which is crucial for practical implementation. Moreover, as a federated learning algorithm, there should be a thorough analysis of the convergence guarantees, which seems to be lacking.\nThe experimental setup presented in the paper demonstrates a certain degree of comprehensiveness; however, it appears to be somewhat limited in terms of diversity. The FL baselines utilized in the study are mainly adaptations from centralized methods, which may not fully represent the state-of-the-art in unsupervised representation learning within the FL context. \nLooking at the results outlined in Tables 1 and 2, it becomes evident that in a majority of the scenarios, the performance of the proposed method is either on par with or falls short of other unsupervised baselines.

It motivates its approach by a mutual information argument: since in standard SimCLR the goal is to maximize the mutual information (MI) between the two generated views, this MI can be decomposed into a local variant that corresponds to local SimCLR and two excess terms that need to be bounded. The first relates the mutual information between the first view and its local client, which is lower bounded using a classifier that seeks to predict the client ID from the first view. The second term relates to the additional or excess mutual information of the second view on the client which can be upper bounded by a second classifier that predicts the client ID from the second view. In addition, the paper presents a semi-supervised variant of this approach."

The proposed method does not have to outperform the baselines, as long as the benefits and limitations of it in comparison with existing methods are properly discussed. To stress this point: it has become usual to require papers to have large tables where the proposed method has \"the best number\" in each row, but this just promotes scientifically questionable practices to improve the numbers. I am happy that this paper presents more interesting results, but they require, unfortunately, a more thorough discussion. One could even, for example, use mutual information as quality measure (where one would probably rely on the more tractable Wasserstein dependency measure [6], isntead of approximating MI).\n- Please state what exactly the supervised baseline in your experiments is (I assume FedAvg). Please compare to (one of the) FL variants for non-iid data, such as FedProx [4], FedBN [5], and SCAFFOLD [3], as baselines.\n- For the semi-supervised setting, please compare to pseudo-labeling approaches [1,2] as semi-supervised baselines.\n\n\n[1] Abourayya, Amr, et al. \"Protecting Sensitive Data through Federated Co-Training.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.05696 (2023).\\\n[2] Bistritz, Ilai, Ariana Mann, and Nicholas Bambos. \"Distributed distillation for on-device learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 22593-22604.\\\n[3] Karimireddy, Sai Praneeth, et al. \"Scaffold: Stochastic controlled averaging for federated learning.\" International conference on machine learning.
