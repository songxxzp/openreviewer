Moreover, in the Crafting environment, the paper's method underperforms PPO and PPOC in many tasks, and the overall performance differences are not significant. Another aspect is that the related work is not sufficiently comprehensive, with the latest work seemingly from 2019 (I am uncertain if there are no updates on HRL or Options framework since then).\n\nAdditionally, if different environments are considered as different tasks, the paper's setting seems to relate to curriculum design or automatic environment design and multi-agent policy learning and reuse, suggesting that these areas [1-3] may provide new insights for the work presented in this paper.\n\n\n\n1.
