The authors propose to consider the task all in terms of accuracy and train a binary classifier to estimate the task performance for each LLM. More precisely, in this work, the authors study three estimators. \n\nEmpirically, the authors show that the proposed method outperforms best model in average (BMA) as well as an per instance perplexity based baseline. Training an estimator has O.O.D concerns, particularly the objective is to test on a different tasks; the authors have carefully examined and discussed this issue."

The approach is shown to achieve near 90% of Oracle accuracy (Table 1). \n\nThe authors have investigated and discussed the prominent O.O.D issues thoroughly in the paper.

One popular approach is like G-eval which might overcome the O.O.D issues in some extent. \n- There is no clear conclusion that can be drawn from the paper that in practice, what score to use (and with O.O.D score, whether one should use a score). For example, the NN experiments show that S1 performs the best while in Table 1, S3 performs the best. Note that due to the fact that we work on dataset, there is only 28 datapoints.

The main approach relies heavily on the Large Language Model (LLM) learning from past similar tasks and using that knowledge to measure performance on new tasks. However, I would like to highlight that acquiring the necessary \"knowledge\" for a slightly larger LLM can be a costly process, requiring evaluation on a large number of benchmarks. Additionally, when dealing with a new dataset, an alternative approach could involve evaluating a selection of promising models on a smaller amount of data to identify the best-performing model. This evaluation process can be time-efficient. Thus, the efficiency of different models could also be included\n\nAnother concern I have is related to the adequacy of the baseline comparisons. It seems that a simple baseline approach could involve evaluating all relevant LLMs ( < 100) on a very small dataset and selecting the best-performing model."

If we fine-tune the selected LLM, would it certainly perform better than an LLM that hasn't been selected? Or should we use the selected LLM directly after the router has chosen it?\n\n* * The results from the candidate LLMs (Table 5) clearly indicate that larger models outperform their smaller counterparts.

The problem of OOD in Eq.3 lacks necessary discussion. Eq.3 does not contain notation of $P(y|x)$, it estimates $g_m$. Although the target of $g_m$ is to estimate the correctness of model $m$ that can be potential affected by OOD, there still lacks necessary clarification about what $P(y|x)$ represents in Eq.3.\n4. The relation of solution of Eq.4 and OOD is not clear.  \n5. There is only one optimization problem, that is Eq.1, to find the best predictor function.  Given the learned $g_m$, the rest of the method is to use $g_m$ to choose the language model. How to design a better predictor also needs more discussion. \n6. This approach takes a lot of efforts on choosing LLMs based on a prediction function. For example, Eq.3 chooses a language model directly based on the prediction of $g_m$. Eq.4 introduces the threshold and can get better generalization results. These tricks are valuable, but some of them are popular in traditional classification methods."
