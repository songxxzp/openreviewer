The generation process is grounded in reasoning trees (example in Figure 1). (2) LLMs are run on the benchmark, with different chain-of-thought prompting approaches and some neurosymbolic approaches. \n\nFor (1), the three domains are murder mystery stories, object placement, team assignment (involving commonsense, social, physical, theory-of-mind reasoning). \n- LLMs are used to generate all the data. Figure 1 gives an example of the data generation process of the murder mystery task. \nIn general, the generation process is in three steps: domain injection (obtaining initial gold facts), reasoning tree construction (expanding the gold facts), and story generation (generating narrative based on the tree). \n\nFor (2), Table 5 provides results on GPT-4, GPT-3.5, two Llama-based models, and three Vicuna-based models. Human performance is high (but far from perfect). The machine performance is quite low (except for GPT-4 which is also far from perfect). A few chain-of-thought variants are explored."

Is the result due to poor crowdsourcing incentive structures / crowdworker filtering processes? Or are they good annotators but just being careless? Or are the references actually incorrect (or other problems in the story)?\n- Are there confusing / incoherent parts in the story (perhaps inspired by some of the story generation evaluation metrics)? \n\nThe benchmark is synthetic (which is fine). It only covers three domains where there are lots of people or objects so it may be hard for LLMs to keep track of them. But:\n- There have been so many benchmarks recently (Open Assistant, advanced reasoning benchmark, https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02477, etc.). How do you expect this particular benchmark to be used? \n- We can generate arbitrarily complex synthetic problems. Given that the data is synthetic, how important is it for LLMs to be able to solve these problems (over other benchmarks)? I would be more convinced if this technique can be used to generate arbitrary story and ask arbitrary questions. \n\nLack of citation on tree construction and incorrect citation.\n- The authors\u2019 Table 1 included PrOntoQA which explores logical reasoning, in particular, deductive reasoning (ICLR 2023; https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01240), but the citation after PrOntoQA is actually ProtoQA (EMNLP 2020, which is quite different!). \n- I think PrOntoQA (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01240) and PrOntoQA-OOD (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15269) are relevant, given that those reasoning papers generated ontology tree first, and then generated the examples from the tree. There may be many other papers that have relevant ideas.\n- Some of the story generation ideas are also extremely relevant. For example, https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06774; check other work by those authors for more examples.   \n\nOne thing that seems missing (apologies if I missed it) is to count the number of responses which can not be clearly parsed for each method \u2013 those responses do not necessarily mean that the model isn\u2019t able to solve the problem. Is the non-parseable responses zero? \n\n\nMinor: The Table 1 framing needs to be better. For example, if Sophia knows about the shooting, and Sophia has a grudge toward Emily because Emily stole Sophia\u2019s fortune, then the reference says Sophia is the murderer. In the real world this killer identification is not that simple. We can only take a guess based on the existing evidence. We don\u2019t want LLM to be certain that Sophia is the killer.

Looking at the prompt in Appendix C.1, at the end of page 30, it seems that human engineering is needed to provide the scenario setup, e.g., the following. If my understanding is correct, then the dataset is not \"scalable\" (which the authors claimed is a main advantage over human-annotated ones).\n```\nScenario: Victim: Tessa\nCrime Scene: kitchen\nMurder Weapon: poisonous gas\nSuspect: Penelope\nRole in story: Tarot Reader\nThe suspect\u2019s motive: To protect a secret\n```\n\n2. The dataset creation ablation needs more justification. The authors suggested low GPT-4 performance (Acc) from the ablated baselines as a good indicator of the effectiveness of each creation component, but MuSR outperforms the two ablations in Object Placements, which seems to imply that the creation components are not useful for Object Placements. Reverse observations were seen in the Murder domain, and no comparison was done for Team Allocation. \n\n3. The current experiment exploration seems a bit shallow, as the discussions are mostly about comparing numbers achieved by different LLMs or prompting methods. It's suggested that the authors could provide some qualitative analyses and elaborate on the bottlenecks for LLMs to perform well in such tasks. \nIn addition, adding 1 shot of example showed to improve GPT-4 CoT+ substantially. A conjecture is that adding more examples could improve the performance further, eventually to be close to the human performance. In this case, can this dataset still be considered as challenging one?"

There is a sore need for datasets and evaluations like the one generated here, as previous reasoning datasets, that focus on simpler forms of reasoning or expressed in very synthetic unrealistic language, get saturated as being too easy for SotA models. The current direction of Reasoning with LLMs has consequently taken a turn towards focusing on domains where we still have access to challenging datasets like Mathematics, which while important, is not representative of the real-world \"messy\" general reasoning that LLM's need to demonstrate to demonstrate next-level capabilities. The dataset and method presented here, while flawed in some ways, is to my knowledge the best so far at this.\n\nI wish to call out the originality of the method as well, since it requires a lot more than the standard dataset generation workflow of decide domain -> collect some seed data -> do a lot of crowd-sourced collection-> refine. This requires a careful design of a 'synthetic' data pipeline, through key novel components like the reasoning tree and 'chaptering',  that nonetheless does seem to generate many truly realistic real-world scenarios (again at least in comparison to previous datasets) that challenge GPT-4 and its competitors.\n\nThe results show a reasonable (though not huge) gap between the best performing pure LLM and the claimed ceiling (i.e. the best performing human), which represents the opportunity for models to improve their reasoning capacity. \n\nThe paper is reasonably clear on what it is doing, though some details had me confused, which I enumerate below.

This can lead to there possibly being a sizable number of cases in the dataset where in fact a single gold answer cannot (even in principle) be attributed to the problem.  I am wondering if the authors have considered this issue and how they may say their dataset construction procedure guards against it. Would they claim the best performing or majority human annotator label be considered a lower bound on the precentage of problems for which a definite true answer exists? \n\nI am also slightly concerned about the self-referential use of GPT-4 in constructing the dataset. I think the authors have put in a lot of work to minimize the problem, since they use it only for specific steps after the bulk of the reasoning chain has been fleshed out by the reasoning tree algorithm and the chaptering approach introduces tight constraints so that it seems that the main effect of GPT-4 is 'simply' to turn the abstract narrative into natural language. However recently, there have been concerns raised about the practice of the field as a whole relying on LM's for every stage of generation,evaluation and so on (see [1]) so it would be good to discuss this. indeed the jump in performance from LLama 2 to GPT-4 is large enough to make me a bit suspicious that the use of GPT-4 in the dataset construction is biasing these results in a subtle manner. Would it have been helpful to have used a mixture of LMs to generate the text for the narratives?\n\nA minor point: It seems the second part of the benchmarking is not as complete as may be hoped for. I do appreciate the attempt to explore neuro-symbolic approaches, and the authors used a fair number (5), but why was each only applied to a limited number of domains (were there limitations to each that prevented this?). Also, LAMBADA [2] is a recent general purpose approach to neurosymbolic reasoning that seems like it would be very helpful in all 3 domains (since it performs backward reasoning which is generally more effective on complex reasoning problems) that the authors could have tried.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01850\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13894\n\nOverall none of these concerns seem fatal to me. I think this paper makes a contribution that can unblock further progress in the reasoning field and should be accepted unless Ive missed something."

                "value": "1. I take objection to the title only talking about CoT; while obvious a big breakthrough in LM reasoning it isn't the only game in town :)\n\n2. Table 2: suggest adding citations to the papers for each dataset in the table next to the dataset names.\n\n3. Could the stories on 5minutemystery.com themselves be used for the dataset?\n\n4. page 3 last line: sort of misleading claim. GPT-4 is used in generating the dataset, even if not the \"reasoning chain\" in an abstract sense.\n\n5. you have not defined Prompt(T \\ s)\n\n6. there is no hard deductive  that a murderer \"must* have  motive/opportunity/means to commit a murder, it is a sort of common-sense notion. So apart from the Cot+ setting where you explicitly call that out in the prompt, how is the system to know it has to look for this exclusively?\n\n7.  sec 4.3: \"strength of a relationship\" is a vague term. I have to say that a lot of the writing from sec 3.2-4.3 could use a little more explanation and polish; i could only understanding them after looking at appendix."
