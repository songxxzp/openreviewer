In Table 1, as the authors use BERT-pretrained models, how much contributes come from the text-pretrained model when comparing to conventional dataset distillation.\n\n4. As the pretrained models are used, what is dependency on the pretrained dataset (not the model), e.g. if the image and text encoders are pretrained with trained with the particular datasets, what is the performance of the model pretrained on other datasets training on the distilled dataset?\n5. I wonder do authors know why the distilled images still look like the original real image? In MTT paper, the distilled images are very different from the real image (at least visually). \n\n6. Regarding the distilled text showing in Fig. 3, it seems that the distilled text could provide vague description, e.g. the bottom right image, it changes \"two\" men to \"four\" football players, if this algorithm is applied to VQA, won't it provide wrong counting?"

That raises a question of how robust those distilled datasets are and indicates that maybe the source of effectiveness of distilled datasets is somewhat different from what one would expect, that is, models constructing very informative and representative samples. Instead, the impact appears to come from some artifacts, like these high-frequency patterns discussed by the authors.\n    \n- (W2) If I understood correctly, the evaluation of the distilled datasets (image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval) is performed on of the same architecture as the dataset distillation models. The paper does not seem to evaluate if the distilled datasets are equally effective for models of architecture different than those used for distilling the datasets. Considering the point raised above (W1), there is a risk that they are not. Images from the distilled datasets could be easily evaluated on different architectures.
