                "value": "In this research, the authors introduce a new training strategy called SelfVC, aimed at enhancing voice conversion models by iteratively improving them using self-synthesized examples. While previous voice conversion efforts focused on separating speech attributes like speaker characteristics and linguistic content, this often results in the loss of finer details such as accents and emotions from the original audio. Instead of explicitly disentangling these attributes with loss terms, the authors propose a new approach that utilizes entangled speech representations derived from self-supervised learning and speaker verification models. \n\nSelfVC framework comprises several key components. The authors introduce a training strategy that leverages self-synthesized examples to iteratively enhance the voice conversion model which is in contrast to NANCY or NANCY++. In this approach, the current state of the synthesis model is used to generate voice-converted versions of an utterance, which are subsequently used as inputs for the reconstruction task. This method ensures a continuous and purposeful refinement of the model.\n\nThe authors show that incorporating self-synthesized examples during training significantly improves the speaker similarity of the generated speech compared to a baseline voice conversion model trained solely on perturbed inputs. Since the framework does not rely on text, it can be applied to zero-shot voice conversion, voice conversion across different languages, and controllable speech synthesis with pitch and rhythm modifications. \n\nThe experiment section consist of matched and mismatched scenarion to give a better indication of the model's performance. In the matched setting, the authors evaluate the proposed model for speech reconstruction while in the mismatched scenario, speaker conversion is carried out."

The core concept behind this model centers on iterative self-improvement. They address the challenges associated with the disentanglement of speaker and content attributes, which typically require auxiliary task training. Therefore, using self-improvement via iterative refinement provides a way to circumvent this disentanglement problem.\n\nTheir experiments conducted on the LibriTTS dataset reveal impressive reconstruction quality in both guided and predictive modes. Extending their investigations to CSS10 and VCTK datasets, the model demonstrates excellent performance in zero-shot scenarios and exhibits language-agnostic capabilities.\n\nTo evaluate their model, the authors employ a range of meaningful metrics, including CER, PER, SV-EER, and qualitative measures, providing comprehensive comparisons with several state-of-the-art models."
