In particular, they give the explicit form of an invariant and bijective edge embedding $a_{i,j}$ for two points $x_i,x_j\\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\times S^2$. This edge embedding serves to weight the pairwise message passing.  \n\nThey argue that the proposed method is more efficient than expressive $SE(3)$ group convolution (which requires integral on $SE(3)$) and meanwhile more expressive than convolution on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (e.g., SchNet). Experiments on potential prediction, molecule generation as well as trajectory prediction show the better performance and efficiency of the method."
