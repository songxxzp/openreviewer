                "value": "1. The paper writing can be improved. The passage is usually wordy and the word choice is not precise. Also, long sentences are often used which contains a lot of unnecessary logic twists. (For example, the \u201cthree advantages\u201d part presented in the abstract section is wordy and includes long sentences.) Word spelling is another problem, for example \u201ctwo-stage design\u201d. The overall logic flow is okay to help readers capture the idea of the proposed method. A better organization at local level can help readers to catch the insight in a smoother way.\n2. In our current standing, the problem of text-to-music is unsolved and one probably cannot conclude text-to-music can be perfectly decomposed into two stages with \u201cattributes\u201d as the intermediate representation. This is because sometimes word meanings are vague and the implication to attributes might not be this direct. The proposed method does not solve this problem scientifically but proposes a practical solution for this. To this end, the paper possibly overclaim the contribution in the understanding/modeling of the text-to-music problem.  \n3. Based on the previous point, the comparison with other end-to-end text-to-music models can be questionable. The two-stage model is likely to be superior in the cases where a given text prompt indicates clear attribute assignment. But what about the cases where the text prompt is abstract? The paper will be stronger if some demo of abstract text prompt is presented."

                "value": "Overall, I am concerned about the framing of the paper, in that it avoids direct comparison with a large body of generative music research and has key methodological flaws that weaken the argument. Namely:\n- While text-to-music generation in the symbolic domain is correctly assessed as a relatively young field of inquiry, by breaking down the task into text-to-attribute and attribute-to-music generation, the authors omit a large body of work in the generative music space that has dealt with attribut-conditioned generation, albeit in a more limited capacity. Of relevance:\n    - [1] Rhythmic intensity, polyphonic density\n    - [2] Harmonic information, melodic information\n    - [3] Instrument information\n    - [4] Harmonic information, tempo\n\n- While the proposed system encapsulates multiple control signals that the aforementioned works only are able to use a subset of, the fact that none of these systems were used for even targeted comparisons over the control methods they share calls into question the novelty of the present work. It would be useful to contrast how the present work is sufficiently different from these previous papers, and to show whether the proposed method can beat prior works on the attributes they can condition on.\n- The text-to-attribute results seem inflated, as the data generation technique seems to *always place the ground truth attribute value in the description.* While this is a valid type of description, it is hard to believe that human descriptions, conditional on wanting to address specific attributes, would always directly express that in natural language as explicitly as is done in the paper. I think an extension that could significantly improve the paper is to perform the ChatGPT-based data augmentation on the already-filled-in captions themselves and allow ChatGPT to obfuscate the ground-truth attributes, as the task then actually becomes text-to-attribute understanding (rather than just key word extraction).\n- I have serious concerns about the the evaluation section of the work. Namely, ASA and AvgAttrCtrlAcc are metrics I have never seen before in prior work on controllable music generation, which makes it exceedingly hard to compare this work to prior works. Additionally:\n    - It is unclear how ASA is calculated (from within the paper and as well from the Appendix). If ASA is calculated based on the *text-to-attribute* model, then how does that actually evaluate the music generation itself? Conversely, if ASA is calculated based on the *attribute-to-music* model, how is each attribute value being calculated deterministically from the output music?\n    - It is never defined what AvgAttrCtrlAcc is in the main paper, how it is calculated, or how it is any different from ASA.\n    - In Appendix B.2, it is mentioned that ASA values are calculated over different sample sizes and batch sizes for each method. While the costs for the GPT-4 baseline are understandable, I do not understand why the BART-base baseline could not have the exact same sample size as the proposed method.\n- It is unclear whether the BART-base model was retrained on the same data or used directly from pretrained checkpoints (though I think it is implied the latter). In this case, without training on the same data it is hard to tell whether any of the differences are due to model design or just differences in data quality / size, aside from the fact that BART-base has 50% of the number of parameters that the proposed model does."

Perhaps because there are no examples in the body of the paper. Simply posting multiple sheets or piano rolls would probably improve the impression of the paper.\n- Readers with some musicologic background knowledge will note that the example generated in Figure 4 violates prohibitions of classical counterpoint techniques. Of course, it would be possible to use such a technique in film or game music to represent \"forest strolls\" and \"whispering winds\" but this may not be a good example to convey the strength of this technique, since a piece with two voices in the fifth and sixth intervals does not appear to be very sophisticated. (In other words, this example alone gives the impression that it is not a greatly superior technique.) The key is supposed to be C major, but it looks like A minor or A Aeolian to me.
