They succeed in doing this up to a discrepancy which is second-order in the step size, for variants of the two algorithms depending on whether the numerical stability hyperparameter $\\varepsilon$ is inside or outside the square root in the step equation, and for both mini-batch and full-batch cases.  The main result for Adam uncovers three different regimes that penalise the positive one-norm of the gradient, or the negative one-norm of the gradient, or the squared two-norm of the gradient, depending on whether the squared gradient momentum hyperparameter $\\rho$ is greater than the gradient momentum hyperparameter $\\beta$ or not, and whether $\\varepsilon$ is small or large compared with the components of the gradient (the latter two cases correspond to early or late phases of the training, respectively).  Some of the results in the literature are derived as special cases of the theorems in this work.  The paper also reports some numerical experiments that seem to confirm the theoretical results as well as suggest that the one-norm of the gradient is inversely correlated with generalisation."

                "value": "* While the overall content is easily comprehensible, specific details are inaccessible unless one reviews the supplementary material. Specifically, many theoretical works provide a sketch of the proof in the main paper to explain the techniques newly considered/developed by the authors and clarify how they differ from existing techniques. This paper lacks such details.\n\n* In addition, the experimental setup in Section 6 is not self-contained and has elements that seem arbitrary, making cherry-picking possible.\n  * In Section 6, the authors refer to Ma et al. (2022) to conduct experiments for the stable oscillation regime when $\\rho$ and $\\beta$ are \"sufficiently close\". How do you define \"sufficiently close\"? Most ML practitioners are familiar with situations where $\\rho$ (0.99~0.999) is larger than $\\beta$ (0.9). As the authors suggest, is this a spike regime or a stable oscillation regime? There should be a discussion for such questions within Section 6, but the authors merely refer to Ma et al. (2022) without providing specific details.\n  * In Figures 4 and 5, the authors fixed $h$, $\\beta$, and $\\rho$ at certain values and ran experiments by varying other parameters. What is the basis for these fixed values? While $h$ is fixed at different values (7.5e-5 and 1e-4) without specific mention, proper empirical evidence should warrant experimentation across various values. Moreover, for $\\beta$ and $\\rho$, they shouldn't just experiment with a single value. Instead, they should test multiple values and demonstrate consistent backing of their theoretical results.\n\n* The concept of ADAM's modified loss is timely. However, it seems that the resulting modified loss doesn't explain the differences between traditional ADAM and SGD. For example, as the authors mentioned, ADAM often provides worse generalization performance and sharper solutions than SGD. Yet, in NLP tasks using Transformers, ADAM significantly outperforms SGD [1,2]. Such observations lead to two natural questions regarding the authors' study:\n  * If one tunes the hyperparameters of ADAM based on the discovered implicit bias, can they reproduce results where SGD performs better?\n  * Can the authors explain scenarios where ADAM outperforms SGD using their discovered implicit bias (e.g., can they argue that the proposed perturbed one-norm regularization is more suitable for Self-Attention in Transformers than for Convolutions in ResNet?)\n\n[1] Zhang, Jingzhao, et al. \"Why are adaptive methods good for attention models?.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 15383-15393.\n\n[2] Kumar, Ananya, et al. \"How to fine-tune vision models with sgd.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.09359 (2022)."

Since the gradient is 0 at optimum, don't $f$ and $f  + ||\\nabla f||^2$ have the same set of minimizers? and doesn't this still hold when the 2 norm is replaced by any other norm?\n- similarly, in the experiment, why is the perturbed 1 norm close to 0 at convergence? It seems the authors are performing early stopping, but that precisely means that implicit regularization is not happening, and that the model overfits.\n- In the numerical illustrations, is it possible to display more than 3 curves/ values of $h$ and $\\beta$? In particular, for limiting values, why isn't the red cross attained if there is implicit bias?\n- The figure are not averaged across multiple runs to account for randomness\n\n- (contribution summary, third bullet point)?  Why do the authors consider that Adam does not have an implicit bias, despite having a bias term in the backward analysis ODE. It seems to me that the meaning of \"implicit regularization\", eg in eq 1.is the same as \"bias term\" mentioned page 2, but then the statement \"Adam has no implicit regularization\" is unclear."
