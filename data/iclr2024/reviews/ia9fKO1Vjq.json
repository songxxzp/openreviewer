                "value": "This paper focuses on identifying a causal graph in the latent space. The paper extends previous methods as follows: 1) the dependencies between the latent variables can be polynomial (previously linear), 2) the noise of the latent variables can be in the exponencial family (previously Gaussian). The paper presents a theorem for the identifiability of such models, which in general is based on the principle of observing the system in multiple different environments. The number of environments required in the proof is smaller than previous proofs (2l+1 environments vs. the previous quadratic number). The paper also presents proofs for partial (un)identifiability, basically stating that for those parts of the model where the environments behave differently the latent variable can be learned, otherwise the latent variable is unidentifiable.\n\nMy overall initial view of this article is cautiously positive. However, I have multiple questions for clarifications."

Here's an improved version of the weaknesses section:\n\n1. **Latent structure identifiability**: While the paper makes significant strides in latent variable identifiability, it does not discuss the identifiability of the latent structure under the equivalence class. I understand that once the latent variable values are identified, the latent structure can be recovered trivially. However, given that the latent variables are only recovered up to an equivalence class, especially for partial identification case, it is unclear how would these affect the latent structure identification. This is a crucial aspect in causal representation learning, as understanding the underlying causal structure is often more important than identifying individual variables. The paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion or analysis on this aspect.\n\n2. **Functional assumption**: The necessity and expressiveness of the polynomial assumption are not adequately addressed in the paper. While it's understood that this assumption is needed for identifiability, it would be beneficial to have a more detailed discussion on why this specific form is chosen and how expressive it can be in capturing complex causal relationships. It would also be interesting to explore if there are other forms or assumptions that could achieve similar results.\n\n3. **Presentation**: Given that most of the assumptions have a strong graphical interpretation, the paper could benefit from adding more illustrations or visualizations to help readers better understand these assumptions and their implications."

The proof uses common ideas of exponential family distribution [1] to obtain identification guarantees up to permutation and scaling for the noise variables. Further, the idea of using the changing distribution of latent variables identified up to polynomial mixing can be used to obtain permutation and scaling identification guarantees has been explored in prior works [2]. While I agree that the application of these ideas to the task of learning latent causal relationships is not trivial (as noted in the Strengths section above), I am not convinced by the significance of the proposed identification result. In terms of only the latent identification (not recovering causal relationships), the prior works that leverage interventional data can already provide permutation and scaling guarantees with much more general latent structures. For the task of learning the latent causal relationships, the permutation indeterminacy in the learned latents would pose a huge challenge which the authors circumvented by assuming the correct topological order. This makes it difficult for me to assess the importance of the proposed identification result. \n\n* While I appreciate the experimentation over several benchmarks, the scale (dimension of the latent variables) of the experiments is too small, with the maximum dimension of the latent space being 5. It would be nice to see the results with the proposed approach for larger latent dimensions ($d= 10$ or $d=20$ at least) for the synthetic benchmark. \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Aapo Hyvarinen, Hiroaki Sasaki, and Richard Turner.

                "value": "The present manuscript is concerned with the extension of Liu et al. 2022's identifiability result to non-linear models with more general noise terms. The authors present as core contribution a theorem that allows for polynomial models and exponential family noise. A brief discussion on the violation of change of the exogenous terms is presented. Finally, an empirical section on non- and synthetic data sets."

                "value": "IMHO the paper's noteworthy strengths are limited to their idea rather than the execution, therefore, they should be considered (where applicable) as counterfactuals for the moment. Said \"potential\" strengths are considered one-by-one in the following list (the list is ordered in correspondence to the paper presentation):\n* Causal Representation Learning is an exciting and challenging avenue of research, naturally, extending prior results, especially the generalization sort of results, through precise characterization of key necessities is of great value. The authors place an effort in getting prior results to work for larger model classes such as polynomials.\n* An effort of presenting a self-enclosed treatise, covering both theory and empirics.\n* A discussion of partiality, as arguably most of the time in practice we work with approximations.\n* Although this should IMO not count as \"strength\", given that a large portions of papers within the community don't abide by this, but the fact that the authors present a clear and transparent communication of their assumptions."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper suffers from several disadvantages, ranging in importance from minor to more fundamental. The more fundamental ones are of major content/technical concern, and given that this review takes a content-centric approach, they weigh the most for the low scoring. The following list - again one-by-one - aims to provide specific pointers with improvement suggestions if applicable (please note, the list is unordered):\n* Liu et al. 2022 plays a central role in this work, since this work poses a direct successor in the form of an incremental improvement. While an incremental improvement can be of substantial nature, IMHO this work poses a Corollary-type of discussion over Liu et al. Furthermore, the presentation (especially in direct comparison to Liu et al.) does not provide any further justice to the present manuscript's proposed contribution. There is an abundance of repetition of the form \"we've extended it now\" accompanied by a lack of how alleged extension was achieved. Consulting the appendix did not resolve this major concern.\n* Kronecker product definition is not clear, not the usual definition e.g. $(a_1, a_2) \\times B = (a_1\\cdot B, a_2\\cdot B)$. \n* Although I'm confident in being able to guess what the authors refer to in their convoluted discussion on the data-generating process, it really does not help the fact that all shades of exogenous/latent terms (z, u, n) are not being explored thoroughly from first principles. Putting myself in the shoes of a reader who would be unfimiliar with the literature, I'd be tempted to expect that this portion would lead to major confusion.\n* Unusual, and IMHO absurd, number of assumptions paired with severity in some cases (e.g. bijectivity of $\\mathbf{f}$ is exploited oftentimes and arguably standard within the literature, although this should be questioned as well at some point, but existence of a suitable $\\mathbf{L}$ seems more tricky). This point shines especially in considerations of claims of appraisal made by the authors, such as \"[...] significantly bridg[ing] the divide between foundational theory and practical applications\", that seem to overestimate the presented contribution(s) and this, with all due to respect, in a debatably arrogant manner.\n* Corollary 3.2. seems to carry no value when considering that the whole paradigm of change of causal influence is based on the complete change assumption.\n\nFinally, following list provides concrete recommendations/pointers as to how the work might be improved such that its potential value for the community can be recognized/achieved. Again, this review is intended, respectfully, as constructive criticism and by no means as an attack to the authors. Sincerely, I hope that some of the below aspects can help:\n* Given the heavy reliance on Liu et al. 2022, the authors should consider actually saying what \"transitivity\" is within their introductory section and avoid using formulations that Liu et al. use in different contexts (e.g. \"absorbs\").\n* Please consider rewriting the introduction s.t. redundancy with Section 2 is being reduced. The extra space that is won through this is valuable presentation space, which avoids having to put otherwise more important results into the appendix.\n* Please consider rephrasing Fig.1 caption as not simply being a copy of the introductory text description of the Figure.\n* Please consider removing the pre-text at the beginning of Section 3, in favor of relevant discussions, as it arguably provides no additional value given all the text before (Abstract and Sec.1,2)\n* Please consider improving accessibility to the Figures by resolving the issues on the following two dimensions: (1) label/legend and general font sizes but also (2) proportions e.g. the choice of content being presented (e.g. Figure 6 and 7 do not convey valuable information w.r.t. this aspect)."

            "questions": {
                "value": "TL;DR: No questions.\n\nEven though I've checked the appendix, I've not done so in utmost detail, still, I'm confident in being able to guess what the authors actually mean or refer to in situations of uncertainty, therefore, no questions are derived on that end. Furthermore, the lack of discussions on the actual key insights, for making the transition to polynomials & the exponential family work, does not allow me to raise any further questions."
