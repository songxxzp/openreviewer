As opposed to previous works, this method defines a tree structure that finds a meta-robot to act as an intermediary fine-tuning platform before the policy is transferred to a target robot (i.e. finding a common robot-morphology ancestor in the robot evolution tree). This robot evolution tree allows for faster transfer between source and target robots because the policy only needs to be transferred to the meta robot once, as opposed to N times (as with previous methods). The paper experiments on several transfer tasks, including manipulation tasks where the morphology of the robotic hand changes from source to target."

This method exposes clear gaps in the literature regarding and proposes a simple and novel method that can improve the sample efficiency of existing robot-robot transfer methods. Additionally, the authors propose an interpretable way to measure the distance between robot hardware morphologies in equation (3). \n\nMainly, the authors' proposal of an ancestral meta-robot common to all target robots is an interesting idea worth exploring. It is clear from the results reported in the paper that this idea speeds up training time/simulation time."

However, I am concerned that they are claiming that just because two robots share a similar kinematic tree, that they also share a similar expert policy. In my understanding, the kinematic tree matching would relate a pair of robots with 2 fingers and 3 fingers more closely than a pair robot with 2 fingers and 4 fingers. However, it very well may be the case that a robot with 2 fingers will act more similarly to a robot with 4 fingers than one with 3 fingers.\n- Further, the convex hull of robot hardwares might be irrelevant if the robots close in hardware-space are far in policy space\n\n2. I am curious about the method the authors use to actually train the policies on the new robots. The description of generating new robots is clear but the method for actually transferring the policies is not.\n\n3. I am concerned about the notion of neural plasticity in this problem. Simply fine-tuning the policy more times might lead to the degredation in performance that we see in the HERD and REvolveR methods\n\n4. The authors do not demonstrate the quality of the new policies. I know they are training to achieve some specified success rate but I think more experimentation on what the transferred policies are is important to discuss in this paper"

Using \u201ckinematic tree matching\u201d and some geometric heuristics (based on Steiner trees), they are able to identify bodies which can be used in the paths of multiple recipients, reducing the total number of bodies where training is needed to enable the policy transfer.

It is not established within the paper how efficacious the kinematic tree matching methods are\u2014although it seems to be good enough at transferring, it would be interesting to see how this matching deals with adverse cases. The number of training runs in the experiments was quite small, with only 5 random seeds. It would have been better to see a higher-quality evaluation of the method, but the presented results seem clear. It is also not obvious why some of the thresholds in the evaluation were selected, and it would be interesting to see if a change from 80% to 70% or 90% would change the order of the methods.

An example would be, having a robot that has the same kinematic structure but twice the masses. Can the method handle this? It seems that no. Isn't changing the dynamics but keeping the kinematics the same a different robot? I think this deserves more intuition and explanation.\n    - Then, I am not sure how we should interpret the additional experiments on commercial robots. I cannot see the added value of those experiments and how they contribute towards convincing us that the method is applicable to real-world situations/robots. The robots are purely position-controlled and the behaviors are quite simple.\n    - Lastly, the comments on Sim2Real are weak imho. I do not see why the paper is not relevant to Sim2Real methods. The paper/method claims one to many policy transfer with *different dynamics* involved (per robot).\n- The authors have chosen to consider a model-free approach to RL/transfer learning, while obviously the models are known (at least the kinematics part). This choice should be better motivated and highlighted in the text.\n- **One of the videos is not properly anonymized; we can clearly see the face of someone performing the experiments.** Is this part of the video part of the DexYCB dataset? If this is the case, it should have been highlighted.
