                "value": "### Major Concerns:\n1. The novelty of this paper is limited. [1] studies the linearized full fine-tuning while this paper simply replaces full fine-tuning with LoRA. Although the authors emphasize the proposed method is more efficient than [1], it is obvious since LoRA is more efficient than fully fine-tuning.\n2. What's the meaning of $\\phi_0$? For the full fine-tuning, $\\theta_0$ is the pre-trained model weight and is shared for every task $\\tau_i$. However, for LoRA, $\\phi_i$ is newly added parameters for each task $\\tau_i$. Thus, what is $\\psi_0$? Is $\\psi_0$ a shared initialization for LoRA matrixes of every task $\\tau_i$?\n3. In [2], the task vector of full fine-tuning is defined as $\\nu_i=\\theta_i-\\theta_0$, which means the parameter change of $\\theta_0$. Thus, why the task vector of LoRA in this paper is defined as the change of LoRA parameters $\\phi_i-\\phi_0$ rather than the change of $\\theta_0$ as in [3], i.e., $A_iB_i$, where $\\phi_i=[A_i, B_i]$ is the LoRA parameters.\n4. Table 1 only shows the average normalized scores over multiple datasets, so how about the performance of each dataset? Could you provide it in the Appendix?\n5. It seems the proposed L-LoRA method does not perform well on the NLP domain, according to the results in Table 1 and the similarity heatmap in Figure 8.\n6. Why use the proposed L-LoRA rather than the existing LoRA? The single-task fine-tuning results in Figure 7 show that L-LoRA has a large performance drop compared to LoRA in many datasets.  \n\n### Minor Concerns:\n1.

The scaling laws suggest over-parameterisation is necessary for weight disentanglement. I struggle to see the connection between this and the need to partially linearize a model for fine-tuning.\n\n2. A remark in the manuscript is made bottom of page 8 that \"...higher cosine similarity...implies greater redundancy and overlap...This results in more destructive task interference with na\u00efve merging\". I don't follow this as it seems to be opposite to most work in multi-task training. In that setting, na\u00efve training would favour similar tasks as it would not require methods to mitigate task interference (see GradNorm method). Why is this then opposite in the context of this paper?"
