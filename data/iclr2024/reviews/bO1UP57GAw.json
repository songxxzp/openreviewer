                "value": "This paper introduces a novel approach to dataset distillation that focuses on minimizing the prediction discrepancy between models trained on original large datasets and their distilled counterparts. The authors propose an adversarial framework that employs single-level optimization, differing from traditional methods that use nested optimization or gradient unrolling. This new method is not only memory-efficient, requiring as little as 6.5GB of GPU memory to distill ImageNet-1K, but also reduces the memory and runtime needed by 2.5 and 5 times, respectively, compared to the latest techniques."

Comparing against these methods would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed method's scalability."

This is one important assumption but I cannot find a verification for this. Also, it seems that $x_e$ depends on $\\theta_e^S$, which means that they could be different samples over time. Therefore, why would a fix single set of $u$ can approach this dynamic set of \"hard samples\"? This is the main difficulty I have when I try to understand why the proposed method would work. \n- I noticed that the authors use soft label instead of one-hot label. However, some baseline methods in Table 1 and Table 2 do not apply this. I think it would be beneficial to indicate this point when comparing with other baselines. \n- Figure 5(b): it seems that the performance will drop when using more checkpoints, which looks counterintuitive to me: the approximation outperforms the original loss objective in terms of the final performance. It would be beneficial to provide more analysis on this point."
