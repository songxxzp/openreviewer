In order to overcome the case when the number of OOD samples is too smalll (which could lead to overfitting), the authors propose a generative adversarial approach that uses real OOD data for supervised generation of synthetic OOD samples and thus could better represent the OOD space. More concretely, they propose a Wasserstein-score-based generative adversarial training\nframework where the generator explores OOD space and synthesis virtual outliers with the feedback provided by the discriminator, while the discriminator exploits the generated outliers to separate IND and OOD data distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach in OOD detection when compared with other state-of-the-art approaches."

It would be interesting to visualize the curves in figures 2 and 3 also as a number of several ratios (IND/OOD). How many number of OOD samples do you need to generate in each case? \n- Why do you distinguish between two experimental scenarios (balanced vs imbalanced OOD classes)? It is assumed that OOD data is unlabeled. So, it does not matter how many data is in each class. Please clarify this aspect.\n- Another aspect which is not clear to me is how do you define the imbalanced regime for OOD, i.e. you mention 'only a few classes are observed'). I thought imbalance refers to different ratios between the samples of OOD classes or with respect to the samples in the IND classes. What is in each case the ratio between majority classes and minority classes?\n- If the generative adversarial approach is unconditional, why the case of imbalanced scenario is relevant? OOD data is unlabeled anyway.\n- How do you evaluate the quality of the synthetic OOD samples? Some quantitative and qualitative analysis is indicated."

This method facilitates the generator in traversing Out-of-Distribution (OoD) spaces to produce virtual outliers, guided by feedback from the discriminator. Concurrently, the discriminator harnesses these outliers to distinguish between In-Distribution (InD) and OoD data within the designated Wasserstein score space. The study furnishes theoretical validations confirming the method's robustness, highlighting its capacity to seamlessly segregate InD and OoD data, including the synthesized virtual OoD samples. A unique experimental paradigm is unveiled, termed Within-Dataset OoD detection, which offers a more rigorous test for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) compared to the conventional Between-Dataset OoD differentiation tasks. The efficacy of the proposed technique is further validated through extensive benchmark tests across varied image datasets."

For instance, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a widely accepted metric in many domains, including OoD detection. It would be beneficial to understand the performance of the proposed method under such widely recognized metrics. Furthermore, the reliance on outlier exposure raises questions. Specifically, OoD detection typically aims to identify data points that deviate from the expected distribution, rather than simply identifying outliers. The distinction between these two is subtle but crucial.\n\n2. Generality of Proposed Setting: The proposition of the Within-Dataset OoD detection is undoubtedly a fresh perspective. However, its universal applicability remains a concern. This setting, which treats different classes within the same dataset as OoD with respect to one another, might not capture the diverse and multifaceted nature of real-world OoD scenarios. To many, this approach might appear as an analysis of variations within a single domain rather than a genuine OoD situation. \n\n3. Scalability Concerns: The scalability of the proposed method, especially when confronted with vast and diverse datasets , remains ambiguous."
