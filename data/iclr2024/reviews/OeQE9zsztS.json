                "value": "This work stands at the crossroads of kernel learning and regression, in close connection with manifold learning. The contribution is presented as a novel theory to incorporate both unlabeled and labeled data into the resolution of the regression task (see our comments).  The authors propose to address an inductive regression estimation problem with the additional assumption that the target function satisfies a smoothness constraint defined with respect to a given Mercer kernel-induced metric. A key result of the paper is that the target is proved to be attainable within a RKHS based on a spectrally transformed kernel (say $H_{K_s}$).\nEmpirically this problem can be handled with the choice of a single regularization term that writes as a variance term in the RKHS H_{K_s}.\nThe authors then propose two novel (closed-form) estimators that rely on both kernel and representation coefficients learning. In the first setting, the user is supposed to know exactly the spectral transformation of the eigenvalues at work in the spectrally transformed kernel built from the eigenvalues of the original base kernel. A computable kernel $\\hat{K}_s$ is recursively built and a closed-form solution is provided for the empirical ridge regression problem in the RKHS associated with the approximate kernel. This novel estimator comes with an minimax optimal excess risk bound. In the second setting, a (two-step) transform-agnostic estimator is proposed with $K_s$ defined as the inverse Laplacian and a finite feature map representation based on kernel PCA applied on unlabeled data. The novel estimator is also studied at the lens of an excess risk bound. Numerical experiments complete the picture with a comparison of  the STKR different variants to Label-Propagation."

Accordingly, in the case the spectral transform is known, they propose to perform a montecarlo estimation of the STK using labelled as well as unlabelled examples and perform STKR using labelled samples. For this methodology both estimation and approximation errors are bounded (theorem2,3). Implementation details are also discussed.\n\nFor the case the transform is not known, they propose following a commonly used two stage process: self-supervised learning using unlabelled samples to learn a d-dim representation. Then, perform ridge regression using the labelled examples under the learnt representation. Again, theorem4,5 provide the estimation and approximation errors. Interestingly, the approximation is shown to be tight (theorem 5& prop5), proving that this methodoloy is no worse than the original proposal of STKR.\n\nSimulations results on few benchmarks are provided."

It would be interesting to see\n- how the proposed method compares to label propagation in terms of (training and) inference time,\n- if there is another known feasible inductive method, how this method compares to STKR,\n- how the proposed method compares to other (non-kernel) methods, surely there have to be some deep learning methods for these problems?\nOf course, the proposed method is already relevant through its theoretical analysis, but a better experimental evaluation would help to better understand the practical relevance.\n\nThe assumptions used in the theoretical analysis appear to be relatively strong compared to what I know from the supervised learning literature, at least when thinking about continuous input spaces rather than graphs. For example, if the base kernel was a Sobolev kernel, the associated RKHS would have to have a smoothness $s > d/2$, which might be unrealistic in high dimensions. In this case, many theoretical results such as the ones in Fischer & Steinwart (2020) allow the target function to lie in an interpolation space that is larger than the RKHS.

How would you expect this to compare to STKR in terms of runtime and accuracy?\n\nIn the proposed algorithms, could it be beneficial to use more advanced linear system solvers like the CG method instead of Richardson iteration?\n\n\n**Major comments**:\nParagraph before Proposition 1: The definition of $\\overline{\\mathcal{X}}$ is very imprecise. It looks like you are summing inside of $\\mathcal{X}$, even though $\\mathcal{X}$ might not be a vector space. It is also not clear whether the sums are allowed to be infinite. On the one hand, I would assume them to be finite because you didn't impose any assumptions on the $a_i$. On the other hand, you say later that $\\overline{\\mathcal{X}}$ is a Banach space, but it wouldn't be complete if you only allowed finite sums. I assume that you would want $\\overline{\\mathcal{X}}$ to be the space of finite signed measures on $\\mathcal{X}$, then the norm / distance could be defined through kernel mean embeddings, and $f(\\mu) = \\mu_f$ would be the pushforward measure.\n\nProposition 1 seems to be mathematically elegant, at least when reformulating it with measures as discussed in the previous comment. However, the notion of this \"alternative\" Lipschitz constant seems rather unintuitive to me, and I am not sure what benefit it brings compared to just using the RKHS norm.\n\nThe centeredness assumption on the base kernel is worrying me, as I do not fully understand its practical and theoretical implications. Where is this assumption necessary? I understand that it is necessary for Proposition 1. Is the purpose to make the smoothness notion shift invariant and not having to worry about the constant part of the target function that is not covered by the smoothness $r_t(f)$?\n\nIn Theorem 1, it was not fully clear to me whether the assumptions above Section 2.2 are also assumed in the theorem; for example, the assumption $\\mathcal{H}_t \\subset \\mathcal{H}_K$ is repeated in the theorem.\n\n**Minor comments**:\n- Section 2, page 2: You write $dp(x)$ in the integral multiple times, but you did not define $p$. You could just write $dP_{\\mathcal{X}}(x)$.\n- Footnote on page 2: Since $L^1(P_{\\mathcal{X}}) \\subseteq L^2(P_{\\mathcal{X}})$, it is not necessary to assume boundedness for the existence of the expectation. Is boundedness also required for other things?\n\"$\\mathcal{H}_{K_p}$ are also known as interpolation Sobolev spaces\": I think from the definition these are known as power spaces, see e.g. [1], although they are often (?) identical to interpolation spaces. In the case where the RKHS of $K$ is a Sobolev space, these are usually also Sobolev spaces, but you did not assume this.\n- Small typesetting observation: In Proposition 1, $\\overline{\\mathrm{Lip}}$ is italic while it is not italic above. Maybe you used \\text{Lip} instead of other commands such as \\DeclareMathOperator or \\operatorname or \\mathrm?\n- Before Section 2.2, you use the absolute value on $\\overline{\\mathcal{X}}$, is this supposed to be the total variation norm?\n- In Section 3 (page 6), you should explain that $s^{-1}(\\lambda) = 1/s(\\lambda)$ (if I understand correctly), or perhaps directly write $s(\\lambda)^{-1}$. I thought that $s^{-1}$ was the inverse of $s$ until I noticed that it didn't fit with the implementation.\n\n[1] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00365-012-9153-3\n\n**Summary of discussion:**\nWhile the authors did not extend their experiments much, the theoretical analysis is interesting in its own right and the authors fixed some technical issues and improved some explanations, so I raised my score from 6 to 8."

                "value": "The paper focuses on utilising unlabelled data within the framework of Spectrally Transformed Kernel Regression (STKR). The rough idea is that unlabelled data can be used to infer the smoothness of the kernel. This is achieved by considering spectrally transformed (Mercer) kernels:\n$$ K_s(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty s(\\lambda_i) \\psi_i(x)\\psi_i(y). $$\nThe form of the transformation $s(\\lambda)$ influences the smoothness of the kernel and this is what is learned from the unlabelled data. The paper investigates this theoretically by assuming the target function $f^*$ has a target smoothness constraint $f^* \\in \\mathcal{H}_t$ and assumes the target smoothness is at least as smooth as the base kernel $\\mathcal{H}_t \\subset \\mathcal{H}_K$. \n\nTheorem 1 states that under certain conditions, $\\mathcal{H}_t$ is the RKHS of a spectrally transformed kernel. This can be viewed as an existence result of a suitable $s$ and so motivates the rest of the paper.\n\nNext, the authors consider the theoretical implications of this and construct algorithms of STKR in two different settings: (1) $s$ is known and (2) $s$ is unknown. Setting (2) is the real-world situation and so is of more practical benefit. \n\nSetting (1):\n\nThe problem here is that $K_s$ may not be computable. Therefore, the authors utilise the unlabelled data to estimate $K_s$ by a Monte-Carlo approximation of the kernels $K^p$, which is $K_s$ with $s(\\lambda) = \\lambda^p$ (it is assumed that the true $s$ is expressible as a power series). Under this scenario, it is shown that KRR is minimax optimal under exact evaluation of $K_s$ (Theorem 2). The approximation error of using $\\hat{K}_s$ over $K_s$ is also shown to be bounded (Theorem 3).\n\nSetting (2):\n\nFirstly, the authors consider $s$ as the inverse regularised Laplacian. This is motivated by the fact that this $s$ has been shown to work well empirically in prior work and can be analysed theoretically.\n\nNext, the authors consider a kernel where the first $d$ eigenfunctions are learned through kernel PCA on the unlabelled data. This is equivalent to STKR with $s$ as a truncation function, all eigenvalues smaller than $\\lambda_d$ are eliminated. The authors provide theoretical guarantees that lower bound and upper bound the worst and best case errors respectively.\n\nMain Contributions:\n- Establishing STKR as a principled way to utilise unlabelled data, showing that under certain smoothness conditions, a target function must be smooth with respect to a certain Spectrally Transformed Kernel (STK).\n- Implementing practicable STKR algorithm in an inductive setting with general transformations, which is more practical than previous transductive approaches. This implementation is scalable, has closed-form formulas for the predictor, and comes with statistical guarantees.\n- Developing rigorous theoretical bounds for this general inductive STKR, proving estimation and approximation error bounds, some of which are tight or near-tight."

The author's approach, to my knowledge, has not been considered before.\n\nThe theoretical results are very interesting. The methodology developed is motivated and justified from the author's theoretical work. The authors developed a rigorous theoretical underpinning for inductive STKR and provide tight statistical learning bounds for prediction errors. This addresses the issue of generalisability in STKR, by offering strong statistical guarantees. Not only this, the methodology is practicable and this is evidenced from the experimental results and computational complexity calculations. \n\nThe paper is very well written and easy to understand. A lot of background material is presented, which contextualises the work. The appendices are also well written and include extensive discussions on related works."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The main weakness, in my view, is the lack of a comprehensive empirical investigation. \n\nWhile the paper does explore the effect of different transformations $s(\\lambda)$ and provides a comparison to other methods such as label propagation and kernel PCA, it does not delve deeply into the conditions or characteristics of datasets that would lead to STKR's superior performance. It is probably very difficult to do this theoretically, but a more comprehensive empirical investigation could lead to insights. This could be seen as a limitation in fully understanding the potential and limitations of STKR.\n\nAlso, although the experiments cover several datasets, they are all within the realm of graph node classification. Expanding to other types of data could demonstrate the generality of the approach.\n\nWhile the paper mentions the efficiency of the STKR-Prop, a detailed computational complexity analysis, especially in comparison with other methods, could add more depth to the evaluation of the methodology. \n\nFinally, I don't see where the regularisation term $\\eta$ in SP-Lap is specified within the paper."

Could there be situations where this condition is violated and so the resulting theory doesn't hold? Does this have any practical consequences?\n\nCould proposition 3 be generalised for other transformations $s(\\lambda)$? With $s(\\lambda) \\geq \\lambda$?\n\nDo you have any intuition as to why STKR performance degrades as $p_{test}$ increases? Does this imply scalability issues?\n\nWill the code used in the experiments be provided for reproducibility?"
