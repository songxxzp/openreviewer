It aims at minimizing the expected simple regret, i.e., the expected difference between the oracle best arm and the recommended arm. An asymptotic worst-case lower bound concerning the variances of the arms is provided. An algorithm AS-AIPW strategy is devised with almost matching worst-case upper bounds. Compared to the existing literature, it utilizes more information of the distribution (i.e., the variance) to refine the arm allocation rules. Additionally, it considers the benefit of taking contextual information into account. Experiments are also conducted to illustrate the empirical performances."

While the proof is complicated, the result yields theoretical foundations on why we should pull the arms according to the allocation proportional to their variances in order to hit the lower bound. It also resolves the remaining lower bound problem in [1] to some extent (as [1] considers the misidentification probability instead of the expected simple regret). I believe this is the main novelty of the paper and is of theoretical interest.\n\n- An algorithm AS-AIPW is designed whose upper bound asymptotically matches the lower bound in the worst-case up to a factor of $log K$. A non-asymptotic upper bound is also given, which helps us to understand the convergence rate.\n\n- Empirical studies of the algorithm are carried out to illustrate the performance.\n\n[1] Lalitha, A., Kalantari, K., Ma, Y., Deoras, A., and Kveton, B.

Therefore, if my understanding is correct, the advantage of **AS-AIPW** should appear if we run it on a hard instance with large reward magnitude but small variance.

Even if I have appreciated the comparison with fixed-budget BAI when no contextual information is available, I do not believe that it is fair to compare the same baselines (that are not thought for contextual settings) with the proposed algorithm. I suggest employing at least another algorithm thought for the same setting proposed by the authors if present (and if no competitors are available, please write it)."
