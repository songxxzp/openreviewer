                "value": "This paper introduces \"Aranyani,\" a novel framework designed to compute and enhance group fairness in online learning scenarios. The work is systematically presented, starting with foundational knowledge on oblique decision trees in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 delves into the problem formulation, detailing demographic parity equations for both offline and online settings. Within this chapter, the authors explain their choice of the Huber loss function, addressing the challenges inherent to online scenarios. Chapter 4 provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of Aranyani, covering its expectations and assumptions. The experimental findings, presented in Chapter 5, benchmark Aranyani against prominent online learning algorithms.\n\nCentral to the paper is Aranyani's innovative approach to achieving fairness in online settings. Aranyani leverages an ensemble of oblique decision trees, which are capable of making nuanced oblique splits by utilizing routing functions that account for all input features. The authors begin by detailing an offline setting, constraining the objective function with a fairness objective (L1 norm), and then adapt this framework to oblique decision forests. Given the non-smooth and convex nature of the L1 norm, optimization challenges arise. The authors cleverly employ Huber Regularization to smoothen the L1 norm, paving the way for more effective optimization.\n\nWhat sets Aranyani apart is its approach to data storage. Traditional methods tend to store instances to train a model, whereas Aranyani calculates fairness gradients based on aggregated statistics from previous decisions, effectively handling the online situation.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, the authors rigorously examine four fundamental properties of Aranyani: Demographic Parity (DP), Rademacher Complexity, Fairness Gradient Estimation, and Gradient Norm Convergence. Each of these properties is supported by robust theoretical proofs.\n\nTo validate their approach, the authors conduct experiments on five diverse datasets: UCI Adult, Census, COMPAS, CelebA, and CivilComments. Their results indicate that, in terms of the Fair-Accuracy trade-off, Aranyani outperforms existing online learning algorithms across most datasets. Notably, its performance on the COMPAS dataset was less dominant, warranting further investigation."

Could there be challenges in using Aranyani for datasets with less than 7k entries?\n- While the paper indicates that Aranyani is more suited to trees of limited height, it would be useful to explore alternative approaches for instances where greater tree height is needed.\n\nExperimental Enhancements: \n- Real-World Application: Observing Aranyani's functionality in intricate real-world situations, outside the realm of benchmark datasets, would add depth to the findings. \n- To further solidify the paper's comparative analysis, including more recent fairness representation learning models from the related works \u2014 modified for online environments \u2014 as baselines would be valuable.\n\nVisualization Feedback: In Figure 4 (right), legends are necessary to distinguish which line represents accuracy."

Proper preprocessing, data augmentation, or applying techniques like re-sampling can help. If Aranyani uses any such methodologies or has in-built mechanisms to counter these biases, it would be crucial to highlight.\n- Furthermore, explaining the adaptability of Aranyani in different scenarios, especially with datasets that are inherently biased, would provide clarity on its real-world applicability."

The authors provide a theoretical analysis (Section 4) of the proposed approach such as a bound on demographic parity (DP) based on the depth of the tree under the assumption that the fairness constraint is satisfied on each tree node. Moreover, they also show that the proposed approach to aggregate statistics in an online fashion guarantees gradient norm convergence with enough time steps.

                "value": "This paper explores the application of an existing machine learning model to improve group-level fairness performance in an online data streaming setting. Specifically, the authors work in a setting where individual data points arrive at the predictive system one after another over time. Given this setting, the authors deploy a predictive algorithm based on an oblique decision forest. The paper shows how to incorporate group fairness notions such as demographic parity while ensuring efficient training of the forest-based model online. The authors use real-world datasets ranging from tabular to vision and language to highlight the efficacy of their method."

                "value": "The authors propose a novel application of oblique decision trees in the online group fairness setting. I believe the paper has several strengths.\n\nThe work is original as it explores the novel application of oblique decision trees in the context of group-fair online predictions. In order to ensure predictions are accurate and fair in the online setting, the authors provide key insights and explore the novel adaptation of oblique decision trees for efficient training. They also introduce theoretical lemmas to help show the relationship of the complexity, fairness performance and the modeling choices, e.g., the depth of the tree.\n\nThe authors have presented a work of good quality. The paper provides extensive theoretical complexity analyses. In addition, the authors provide evaluations for demographic parity fairness on multiple modalities of data, e.g., tabular data, image data, and language data. The work also includes extensive ablation studies to empirically show the properties and behavior of the proposed method.\n\nThe authors do a good job in making the paper clear to read. The scenario is clearly defined, the intuitions clearly stated, and the modeling is explained in clear language and terms. The article was relatively easy to follow even without understanding of oblique decision trees.\n\nIn my opinion, the work can be significant in showing how to adapt a powerful tree-based model for online predictions with fairness as an important consideration. This is especially for tabular data where tree-based models have been shown to perform better. The authors' proposed model may prove to be an useful tool in the practitioner's toolbox for online predictive systems, especially where fairness is also important to consider."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "In terms of weaknesses, I find the following points.\n* The evaluations only show demographic parity results. While the authors mention how to formulate Aranyani for other group-fairness notions, they provide no results to highlight how it would perform for notions also based on the true label, e.g., equalized odds or equal opportunity.\n* The results do not have error bars. So, it is difficult to compare different methods without taking into consideration the variance across different initialization. As far as I understand, Aranyani and the other baselines may not be guaranteed to find the global optimum. Hence, reporting the mean and the variance across different initialization is very important for fair comparison. \n* While the work measures and reports the expectation of the fairness measure at each time step, it is unclear what the fairness dynamic looks like for different methods across time as the training proceeds. In online settings, the variation of the fairness measure over time may tell a story and be essential to see. Specifically, it is not clear how the fairness measure **varies across different time steps**. It is not clear if the training process is relatively stable or not, and how Aranyani compares to the baselines in this respect.\n* As per the appendix results, the fairness result variance seems to increase significantly as we move from a single tree to a forest. The authors motivate the need for a forest instead of a tree with a promised reduction of variance. However, in some sense, it seems that variance can increase as well. This aspect does not seem to be discussed well.\n\n\nThere are a few minor points as well.\n* Figure 4 (right) includes error bars, but it is not clear how the variance is measured in this case. Is it the variance of a measure across time steps? It is not clear why the tree depth impacting the variance of fairness so greatly.\n* The fairness performance seems to degrade considerably when the tree depth is higher. This follows from the theoretical finding, where the fairness bound becomes looser as we increase the tree depth. However, this may limit the expressivity of the model in some situations.\n* There are no ablation studies that show the impact of the particular loss that is used to measure fairness, i.e., using Huber loss over $\\ell_2$ loss or hinge loss.\n* While the authors provide a complexity analysis for their method, an empirical runtime analysis comparing the different methods might have also been insightful.\n* Figure 4 (right) does not have any legend. It is difficult to understand which line/symbol corresponds to which metric.\n\nVery minor point.\n* The Aranyani triangle symbol in the text does not match with the plots."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The authors showed how to implement a binary oblique decision tree. However, is it possible to formulate a non-binary version of oblique trees for fairness? Are there any scenarios that may necessitate non-binary splits in the tree?\n2. The scenario considered exposes the ground-truth label of an individual data point after the prediction is made, irrespective of the predicted label. However, in many real-world online decision-making settings, the ground-truth label is observed **only** when the prediction/decision is positive [1, 2, 3], e.g., in the COMPAS recidivism setting. This is the selective labeling scenario that reflects the real world more. Can the method be applied when true labels are not observed when the prediction is negative?\n3. Instead of considering a tree-based structuring across the nodes, can we train a GNN where each node's representation is learned from the features? Would it be possible to apply similar tricks to optimize for the problem?\n4. Temporal aspects of fairness can have many different meanings. While the expected fairness across different time steps is one measure, there can be other measures, e.g., fairness in hindsight. Can Aranyani be modified to work for such temporal notions?\n5. What does the variance of the fairness look like during the online training across the time steps? Does the fairness measure change a lot from one time step to another? Is it stable, or does it reach a stable state relatively soon? Similarly, what does the accuracy nature look like over time?\n6. Why does tree depth impact the fairness variance so much? Similarly, moving from a tree to a forest should reduce variance. But, from Fig. 6, an apparent relationship is not clear. In some cases, it seems that having a forest increases the variance. Do the authors have a thought about this behavior?\n5. How would the method compare to bandit-based solutions? Bandits seem well suited to the single-datum online setup discussed here, where the bandit can observe the true label no matter the decision.\n6. If we start moving away from the one datum at a time setup and consider multiple data points arriving at each time step, would the efficacy of the oblique tree reduce compared to other methods, e.g., MLPs?\n\n[1] Kilbertus, Niki, et al. \"Fair decisions despite imperfect predictions.\" International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics.
