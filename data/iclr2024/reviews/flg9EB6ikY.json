In this approach, SPTD captures the final model along with many intermediate models learned during the SGD style training method. SPTD runs these intermediate models and find the disagreement between the final model prediction and the intermediate model predictions. With some weighting scheme, a threshold based gating function is introduced to estimate the selection region. Given that this method introduces no architectural changes, it has no train-time impact (the intermediate checkpoint storage is an additional overhead). This also means that such an approach can be utilized for not only classification tasks, but other tasks such as regression."

The main idea is to keep a set of checkpoint models during training and compute a weighted average of the prediction discrepancy between checkpoint and final models. The entire process can be described concisely as follow:\n\ng(x) = sum_(t in S) (t/T)^k * L(f_t(x), f_T(x)) where S is the set of checkpoint indices and L is a distance function, such as 0-1 loss for classification or mean absolute error for regression; k is a hyper-parameter\nif g(x) >= tau: abstain; otherwise, use f_T to make prediction\n\nThis is a simple but interesting idea. It seems to provide strong empirical results too. However, despite the presence of extensive experiment results, the fundamental reason why this method has an advantage over methods that calibrate uncertainty directly is still not clear to me. Furthermore, I have some practical concerns regarding the proposed approaches as well.\n\nOverall, I believe this is an interesting work but it still lacks a deep insight into why this machinery is expected to work better than prior approaches. This is why I currently rate this paper a bit below the acceptance bar but surely, if the authors address my concerns convincingly, I will be happy to upgrade my rating -- it is possible that I might have missed something important here."

All discussion points & experiment highlights are well-organized, which makes the core idea very digestible. \n\nI also appreciate the extensive results with a lot of ablation studies. There are also some pretty interesting theoretical results in the appendix. I think some of these results do provide some theoretical insights into how the variation of certain performance metric across checkpoint models can be related to the probability of correct classification, which could help strengthen the discussion in the main text if the corresponding assumptions is well-justified.\n\nI like that part of the appendix also provides interesting discussion points relating the proposed approach to other lines of research."

I understand that the threshold can be adjusted to meet a certain coverage level on the training set but I am not sure how we could do that for the unseen test set. \n\nIn other words, I feel that setting tau algorithmically should be part of the solution. \n\nSecond, if I understand the main point correctly, the exploitation of the checkpoint model is mainly to help with uncertainty calibration. Then, what makes it perform better than methods that do so explicitly? I think we need a more insightful discussion here.\n\nThird, does the tuning of the parameter k depend on test data? \n\nFourth, part of the claim is the proposed method can be applied on top of existing models. But is it always effective? Could we demonstrate such synergy between SPTD and other baselines? Furthermore, I wonder how well a simple probabilistic method with explicit prediction uncertainty, such as Bayesian Neural Net or Gaussian process would fare against SPTD -- we can either do that experiment or point out previous finding in the literature that already sheds light on this.\n\nLast, will SPTD still be robust regarding checkpoint resolution if the model complexity increases? ResNet18 is probably not a SOTA model for hard classification task such as CIFAR-100 -- how does SPTD work on larger model, such as ViT?"

In your experiment, was it set with respect to the training or test set?\n\nI find this statement confusing: \"checkpoint each model after processing 50 mini-batches of size 128. All models are trained over 200 epochs\" -- by this statement alone, it means if you are making 200 passes over the entire training set & for CIFAR-10, that means looping over a total of 50K * 100 / 128  batches -- so if you checkpoint every 50 batches, approximately > 1K checkpoint needs to be stored -- this seems a bit too extravagant\n\nThat being said, I feel like I have missed something here since the later context clearly points out that the no. of checkpoint models used in the experiment is between 25-50\n\nIn addition, I wonder whether an explicit probabilistic method (such as BNN & GP) would be over-confident in the synthetic experiment.

                "value": "The paper presents SPTD, a new method for Selective Prediction (SP) based on an ensemble approach using checkpoints from the training dynamics. Unlike several of the recent methods, the proposed approach works for several tasks including classification, regression, and time series. The paper presents a comparison between SPTD and different recent state-of-the-art methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The points of weaknesses include:\n\n1- The proposed idea lacks novelty as it is very similar to using ensembles of models. The difference here is that the ensembles are generated on a fixed schedule from the training dynamics. \n\n2- Checkpoints are chosen based on a fixed schedule which can correspond to models of bad performance. A better approach is to follow the approach from [Huang et al. 2017] which constructs an ensemble by choosing points of good performance using a cyclic learning rate. Using good checkpoints removes the need for the complicated weighted aggregation of the disagreement functions as all the snapshots are good models.\n\n3- The proposed method has several hyperparameters including the number of checkpoints and the weights to calculate the selection function $g$ from the disagreement function $a$. \n\n4- Several choices are not clear as described in the following section.\n\nHuang, Gao, et al. \"Snapshot ensembles: Train 1, get m for free.\" ICLR 2017."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1- How was $\\tau$ chosen?\n\n2- \"Checkpoint each model after processing 50 mini-batches of size 128\", how many checkpoints are chosen?\n\n3- In Table 1, the name of the baseline is SAT but in the text, it is mentioned that the baseline is SAT with Entropy Regularization (ER) and Softmax Response (SR) Selection from [Feng et al. 2023]. Which one is the baseline? If the latter, then please update the table as SAT and SAT+ER+SR are 2 different methods.\n\n4- Why not add SelectiveNet as a baseline for the regression task?\n\n5- How were $g$ and $\\tau$ chosen for the Deep Ensembles (DE)?\n\n6- What is the intuition of SPTD performing better than DE for some coverages? It seems counter-intuitive as DE consists of high-performing models vs SPTD which has fixed checkpoints that do not have to be high-performing.\n\n7- How are the disagreement function, g, and $\\tau$ chosen for DE+SPTD?"
