The proposed approach is comprised of a few loosely connected components including concept discoverer, prediction attributor, concept mapper, and plausifyer. Concept discoverer clusters words while disambiguating them based on their senses using the training data. Prediction attributor uses either a set of handcrafted rules, or integrated gradient. The experiments evaluate each component and examples are provided throughout the paper."

POS and sentiment are very small and relatively simple. The types of models that you're fine-tuning are also not very broad (no decoder only models like GPT here). What happens when you evaluate on an NLI task? Could you extend this to work on a task like question answering and evaluate that?\n\n3) It's really hard for me to figure out the appropriate baselines here, which I think is a potential weakness. It's hard for me to contextualize the results you have."

Could you fine-tune on a subset?"

To evaluate utility of explanations, the authors can perform human evaluation. Here I suggest some baselines and ablation studies (1) generating rationales with LLMs (Plausifier in Sec. 2.4) directly based on inputs and predictions (2) skipping the conceptmapper, and directly generating explanations with extracted salient words (in Sec. 2.2) and LLMs. For evaluation of utility, there is a number of references such as [1].\n\n[1] Sun et al. Investigating the Benefits of Free-Form Rationales, 2022\n\nI also hope to see quantitive evaluation of faithfulness, which is crucial for explanation algorithms, but is not quite intuitive for generative explanations. I hope to hear author's thoughts about this.\n\n**The advantage of concept-based explanation to other attribution-based algorithms is not clear from the experiments.** \n\nIn introduction, the authors claim that a limitation of attribution methods is because of \"multi-facet of words in different contexts\". I hope to see the point supported by case studies in experiments.\n\n**Experiments are on sequence tagging and classification tasks only**\n\nI wonder whether concept-based explanations are applicable to more complex reasoning tasks, like reading comprehension and commonsense reasoning. In this case, what explanation outputs do the authors expect?"
