                "value": "The primary contribution of this research paper lies in the proposition of an enhanced method for the more accurate prediction of torsion angles, which takes into account their interrelations. A mere reliance on the decomposition of conditional probability and the simplistic application of LSTM appears insufficient in addressing the intricacies inherent in modeling torsion angles. Consequently, there exist notable limitations and inadequacies associated with such an approach, which warrant discussion and exploration.\n\n1. About explicit and implicit: The authors contend that earlier models have predominantly employed implicit mechanisms to capture the correlations among torsion angles. In contrast, the utilization of a RNN to emulate conditional probability enables the explicit modeling of these correlations. It is apparent that the principal disparity between the proposed model and its predecessors lies in the emphasis on explicit modeling through conditional probability. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that previous models can also be interpreted as involving conditional prediction and, consequently, the explicit modeling of such correlations. A more comprehensive analysis is warranted to delineate the differentiating aspects of the proposed model in comparison to the antecedent approaches.\n\n2. About highlights on adjacent torsion angles: The authors have emphasized the importance of highlighting the interdependence among torsion angles, particularly those that are adjacent to one another. However, a thorough examination of the proposed model reveals a lack of explicit emphasis on this characteristic. As an illustrative example, one can refer to Figure 3, where the authors suggest that the relationship between the torsion angles $\\tau_4$ and $\\tau_7$ should be accentuated, given their adjacency to the chemical moiety c1nnc. Nevertheless, in the case of LSTM employed in the model, there is a paucity of specific information to robustly establish a strong connection between $\\tau_4$ and $\\tau_7$. Given that most adjacent torsion angles in a molecule are also adjacent in the torsion angle sequence, LSTM may inadvertently overlook the correlation between $\\tau_4$ and $\\tau_7$ in such instances. This leads to the conclusion that the explicit representation of torsion angle correlations in the proposed model is arguably inadequate. It is posited that the integration of an attention mechanism may address these concerns, yet the paper lacks a detailed analysis of this potential solution.\n\n3. About conditional probability: While Equation 2 is unquestionably mathematically sound, it fails to account for the potential presence of a ``dominant'' torsion angle within a molecule. It is conceivable that certain torsion angles exert a significant influence on the overall structure, while others exhibit limited dependencies to each other. In scenarios where such a dominant torsion angle is positioned at the rear end of the torsion angle sequence, the predictive accuracy for other torsion angles may be compromised."

Equation 1 posits the primary objective as the generation of torsion angles based on a given molecular graph. This raises the question of how the local structures are acquired prior to predicting the torsion angles. Is it necessary to employ a tool like RDKit to generate these local structures, akin to the methodology employed in Torsional Diffusion?\n\n2. Distinguishing prediction and generation tasks: In Equation 1, the author characterizes the task as a generative one. However, ensuring that the generated torsion angles faithfully adhere to the distribution of the dataset presents a significant challenge. How can we establish the veracity of the claim that the generated torsion angles indeed conform to the dataset's distribution?"
