                "value": "The paper's primary goal is to enhance the interpretability and explainability of Language Learning Models (LLMs) by integrating a generated reasoning process into a QA model as input. The authors conducted experiments on a commonsense QA task, employing a Graph Attention Network (GAT) model to encode an external knowledge graph and identify the most influential nodes/keywords as reasoning evidence. Subsequently, GPT-3.5 was used to generate explanatory paragraphs, elucidating why each answer candidate is considered correct or incorrect. These generated decision-making process paragraphs were then utilized by the QA model for predictions. The experimental findings demonstrated a noteworthy improvement of 5.1% compared to GPT-3.5 on the CommonsenseQA dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of the newly-introduced decision-making process. Furthermore, a human study validated the high quality of the generated explanations. The authors will also release their dataset, XplainLLM, marking it as the first dataset designed to capture the pivotal elements influencing the model's reasoning process."

(2) Numerous typos need correction. E.g., in the subsection of Decision Interpretation on Page 4, \"consider any node...\" needs to be \"for any node\".\n\n2. The task 2 setting is a bit redundant. Since one of the input E_why already contains the predicted answer, why we need to feed it to another QA model for prediction? How often does the QA model's predicted answer differ from E_why?\n\n3. It's important to acknowledge that the explanations generated by the model may be prone to noise, as they are produced by an automated generator rather than a human. While efforts have been made to evaluate both \"why\" and \"why not\" explanations from various perspectives, their quality remains, the quality is still questionable. Notably, only the generated explanations are assessed, while the selected reason-elements from GAT are neither evaluated nor supervised. If these reason-elements are incorrect or suboptimal, it may impact the overall quality of the resulting natural language explanations."

The paper claims that it does the latter, however the dataset is automatically derived from the outputs of a model itself. For example, the reason set is the output of a graph neural network model which itself is a black-box and can be inaccurate. What is the guarantee that the reason-set faithfully reflects the working of the GAT model and therefore how can we be convinced that a dataset derived from a model can be used to evaluate other XAI models in an unbiased way?\n  * A related point is what is the guarantee that the dataset will not favor models that are not from the same family as the model used to create the dataset? What is the guarantee that it wont penalize a model which in-reality is a better XAI model but produces explanation which are different from the current dataset.\n\n* The reason elements are selected as the top-k elements based on attention scores. However the attention scores are itself computed by a black-box graph neural network model. What is the guarantee that the reason-elements are faithful and reflect the actual decision making process of the model?\n  * For example, in Figure 1, the reason elements selected by the model (e.g. delay, delivery, maintain, etc) look arbitrary to me given the question. Since these form the back-bone of the explanation generation process, it is important that the reason-elements truly reflect the model decision-making process and I am not convinced that is the case.\n  * A similar observation about the example in appendix D.4. For the given question: \u201cThe people danced to the music, what was the music like for them?\u201d - why would a top-reason element be \u201cplay_mozart\u201d? Introducing Mozart for this question is unnecessary and might make the explanation meaningless. Also, if used as a benchmark, if a model does not generate Mozart as a part of its explanation, why should it be penalized?\n* The explanation generated from the reason-elements also seem arbitray to me. Even though all the reason-elements are covered in the explanation, the provided explanation does not seem sound to me. For example, \u201c\u201dthe keywords maintain and cease suggest that the clerk wants to keep the check in a secure location\u201d. Why is this a valid explanation generated by the LLM?\n  * I have similar observation and comments for the explanation generated in Why-not-choose column. For example, why would a desk-drawer have too many potential locations to search through? This seems to be model hallucinations to justify the correct answer. \n* The paper claims \u201cAligning Human Understanding and Model Explainability\u201d as one of the major contributions in the intro section and it claims that this explanation can be used to train RLHF models. While I can believe that would be the case, I did not find any experiments to support this. Since this is mentioned as a core-contribution, I believe this merits validation by experiments."
