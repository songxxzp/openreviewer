DP-DAG has been discussed in Section 2, but it may not be clear why the paper still claims being \"first\". Also, it would be great to compare these methods in the experiments.\n- A key motivation of the work is to avoid computing the acyclicity constraint with cubic cost, which has been achieved by DP-DAG.\n\nFurthermore, the overall idea, to my knowledge, share similarities NOCURL and is not entirely new, which has  been well acknowledged and discussed in Section 4.2 and Appendix D.2.\n\nThere is quite some performance drop for the proposed method in many cases (especially for large $d$), although the improvement in running time is notable:\n- It may not be clear how to interpret AUC as compared with NHD. For instance, for the results of 500 nodes in Appendix E.3, the NHD of COSMO and DAGMA are 3.57 and 1.73 respectively, indicating that COSMO performs much worse than DAGMA (probably due to lots of false discoveries). However, the AUC of COSMO is slightly better than DAGMA.\n- Therefore, I would suggest reporting NHD in the main paper that might be more commonly used in structure learning (e.g. see DAGMA and NOTEARS papers).\n- It seems that there is much more performance drop for nonlinear case. Is there a reason for not including NOTEARS-MLP for 40 and 100 nodes?"

Only VP-DAG (Charpentier et al. 2021) is mentioned, but a considerable line of research exists, starting from the seminal works [1,2], to the most recent ones [e.g. 3,4] based on permutation matrices, and in particular [5] that also makes use of a priority vector. The paper does not highlight the pros and cons wrt this literature nor compare with any of the order-based methods empirically.\n\n2. (major) Experiments are carried out on synthetic data with weight settings that are known to have trivial solutions [Reisach et al. 2021]. Hence they are insufficient to validate the method. The experimental analysis should be carried out on more challenging settings (e.g., smaller edge weights) where the trivial baseline sortnregress [Reisach et al. 2021] is not state-of-the-art.\n\n3. By using the tempered sigmoid at training, the adjacency matrix is never acyclic. Acyclicity is only obtained in the limit of the temperature tending to 0, that however turns the gradients to 0. This implies that careful temperature scheduling is required in order to converge to a good solution.\n\n4. The method relies on edge thresholding at test time to remove spurious relationships.

Then, for some arbitrarily small $\\epsilon$, it seems to me that the orientation matrix is the adjacency matrix of a fully-connected DAG. In some sense, $\\epsilon$ controls the sparsity level of the output, however, this is problematic because $\\epsilon$ is not something being optimized but instead fixed a-priori. Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\n* In the paragraph about \"Direct Matrix Regularization\". For the values found for $H$ and $p$ after optimizing, why not simply threshold the smooth orientation matrix by a small amount so that the \"small entries\" are set to zero and are not affected by the possibly large values of $H$. Given that linear models with equal variances are identifiable from the score function, L2 regularization of the weights should not be necessary and I wonder if doing this affects the performance of COSMO.\n\n* I think more details about the optimization procedure should go to the main text. In particular, the scheduling for $t$ seems very important  and it was not clear how it was set in the main text.\n\n* Related to my point above, I might have missed this since I only briefly looked at the appendix. But the NOTEARS $h$ is not a good proxy for acyclicity as discussed by Bello et al. (2022). In fact, given that your method does not rely on $h$, why not simply threshold the smooth orientation matrix by a very small amount and check in $O(|V|+|E|)$ that the adjacency corresponds to a DAG?\n\n* In the experiments, the runtime for DAGMA looks different to what was reported by Bello et al. (2022). These might be because of the available implementation of DAGMA is using different hyperparameters for the optimization, but I am curious what values were used in the comparison for the main text.\n\n* I should also note a related work on learning DAGs by Deng et al. (2023) \"Optimizing NOTEARS objectives via topological swaps\", which obtains better performances in structure estimation although somewhat slower."

The formulation is based on the existing nocurl formulation, with $W = H \\cdot f(p)$. Nocurl also learn a topological order with p along with the typical weighted adjacency matrix H. The difference is that nocurl learns topology from a preliminary solution, while the proposed COSMO optimizes them jointly with a smoothed formulation. This in itself is a worthy contribution, no need to make exaggeration statements such as claiming \"the first unconstrained optimization approach\" (which would be nocurl-u by authors' definition) and nocurl is \"a slightly similar model\". Authors should discuss the differences. \n- learning topology seems to be a hard task by itself. Gradient-based approach may not do too well on it, which explains the poorer results when the number of variable is smaller. What are authors observation on the change in topology over time (by the orientation matrix)?

                "value": "This paper introduces a constraint-free continuous optimization scheme (COSMO) to the structure learning problem that focuses on acyclic graph reconstruction. COSMO employs a differentiable relaxation of the acyclic orientation matrix, allowing it to learn a directed acyclic graph without explicitly enforcing acyclicity constraints. The key contributions include the introduction of a smooth orientation matrix, the development of COSMO, which is significantly faster than existing constrained methods, and a thorough experimental comparison highlighting COSMO's superior performance in terms of structure recovery and computational efficiency. The paper provides valuable insights and tools for more efficient and unconstrained acyclic structure learning."

                "value": "- A primary strength of the method is its provision of an unconstrained continuous optimization approach for acyclic structure learning.\n- The method introduces a novel, differentiable approximation known as the \"smooth orientation matrix,\" which depends on a temperature parameter.\n-  The method outperforms certain constrained approaches in terms of speed due to the quadratic number of operations needed to reconstruct the DAG."

                "value": "-  In Figure 1, are you learning a directed graph or a partially directed graph with undirected edges to be identified later?\nPlease formally define the priority vector in the notation section.\n- While Figure 1 appears to be an illustration of how COSMO works, it's not very clearly explained. It would be helpful to provide a proof sketch or illustration with an example in the introduction to briefly explain how your algorithm works (given this example) and why it's an unconstrained optimization method.\n- Can you provide information on the computational time and sample complexity of COSMO?\n- How do you guarantee the identifiability of the recovered graph, or do the results lead to some equivalence class?\n- In the related work section, consider covering some classic DAG structure learning methods.\n- The method relies on the temperature parameter for the sigmoid function. While annealing the temperature is shown to be effective, selecting an appropriate temperature schedule could be a challenging task, and the method's performance may be sensitive to the choice of temperature.\n- The effectiveness of this approach might depend on the initial conditions. Finding suitable initializations for the priority vector and other parameters could impact convergence and the quality of the learned DAG.\n- Figure 4 does not seem very necessary, and it's not very clear. Consider moving Figure 4 to the appendix and using the space to discuss the sensitivity analysis of your method's parameter choices."
