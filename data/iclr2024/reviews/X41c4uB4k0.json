                "value": "This paper proposes a method, called MuDM, for generating 3d molecules with both single and multiple desired quantum properties based on specially designed score function as guidance. For the single property optimization task, they followed previous work from the images domain to utilize the Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling to estimate the conditional score function which serves as the guidance. Besides, they devised a confidence boundary based on the prediction of the property function to divide the generation process into two stages, i.e., the chaotic stage and the semantic stage, and the guidance only works in the second stage. For optimizing multiple properties, they model the relationships between the multiple properties as probabilistic graph and factorized the conditional score function according to different probabilistic graphs. Their main contribution is extending the guidance on single molecular property to multiple properties simultaneously by building a probabilistic graph to model the relationships between various properties. They conducted experiments for both single-objective and multi-objective optimization tasks to conclude that the designed guidance outperforms other methods and is more efficient. Lastly, ablation studies were carried out to study the impact of the number of MC samples and to demonstrate the existence of the two stages in generation process and the effectiveness of the probabilistic graph."

While I find this topic very important and the proposed guidance mechanism extremely useful (potentially more usable than other existing ones), I think that several important technical aspects of the proposed mechanism are not sufficiently studied (or explained in the text). Besides, in my opinion, the experimental part of this work can be improved. I am happy to reconsider the score if the points listed in the \"Weaknesses\" section will be addressed."

                "value": "1. I think the question about chaotic and semantic stages is very important. Authors briefly talk about it in Section 4.1 and experimentally illustrate the importance of this issue in Figure 7. Besides, authors mention a certain \"property checker\" twice in Section 4.1, however never expand on it. I find it very critical to have a clear understanding of how the sampling stage is taken into account. I would be also interested in seeing the corresponding ablation study (e.g. if to take / not to take into account the chaotic stage).\n\n2. While one of the main contributions of this work is multi-condition guidance mechanism, in my opinion a more solid experimental validation of the proposed method is required: \n    * Combinations of properties considered in Table 2 look a bit strange. Why is dipole moment used in 4 out of 5 considered combinations as Property 2? \n    * Besides, correlation 0.22 doesn't seem too high \u2013\u00a0aren't there better combinations? \n    * Combinations $(\\Delta\\epsilon, \\epsilon_{\\text{HOMO}})$ and $(\\Delta\\epsilon, \\epsilon_{\\text{LUMO}})$ seem to be good candidates to illustrate the dependency from Figure 3(a).\n    * It would be interesting to see some experiments with combination from Figure 3(c). Again, $(\\Delta\\epsilon, \\epsilon_{\\text{HOMO}}, \\epsilon_{\\text{LUMO}})$ seems to be a good candidate for it.\n\n3. _\"We found it is important to set reasonable guidance weights for multi-condition guidance\"_  \u2013 how did authors find these weights and how much do the final results depend on these weights?\n\n4. How does the sampling time depend on the number of MC samples? I would be also interested to see the comparison of the sampling time with other methods.\n\n5. As authors discuss in Section 4.1, point estimation used in DPS is very inaccurate, especially in case of 3D molecule generation. It would be interesting to see some experiments with DPS (e.g. for single property conditioning) and comparison with the proposed MC-based method."

Did you experience any issues of this kind?\n\n2. How did you select the target property values when sampling? Did you randomly sample these values from the distribution taken from the training set?\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n1. Not sure if background about EDM is necessary in Section 3 \u2013\u00a0it seems that the work is based on the latent diffusion only.\n\n2. Following question 1 discussed in \"Weaknesses\", how does the border between chaotic and semantic stage depend on the type of noise schedule? I.e. linear, cosine, polynomial, etc."
