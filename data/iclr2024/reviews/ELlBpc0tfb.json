Amidst rapid advancements in image editing using natural-language instruction, as seen with \"InstructPix2Pix,\" there remains a significant gap in biomedicine. Current models, though effective in generic contexts, fall short in the biomedical domain. MedJourney addresses this by generating counterfactual medical images based on instruction-learning from patient data. The method involves processing two medical images taken at different time points, using GPT-4 to generate a natural language description of disease progression based on associated reports. This information is used to train a latent diffusion model for image generation. Due to the limited availability of image time-series data, the authors employ a two-stage curriculum: first pretraining with abundant single image-report pairs, followed by training with counterfactual triples. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset reveal MedJourney's superior performance over existing methods like InstructPix2Pix and RoentGen."

                "value": "Strengths:\n1. **First paper to develop models for counterfactual image generation in the medical domain**:\nThe paper emphasizes the largely unexplored domain of unconstrained counterfactual medical image generation. While there have been attempts in the biomedical imaging field to answer \"what if\" questions, existing methods primarily focus on simple image class changes, akin to predefined class edits. MedJourney stands out as it closely follows arbitrary natural-language descriptions of disease progression to generate counterfactual images, making it a pioneering method in the field.\n\n2. **The innovative use of GPT-4 to extract the progression description**:\nMedJourney uniquely leverages the GPT-4 model to generate a natural language description of disease progression. When given two medical images from different time points of a patient, manually synthesizing image-editing instructions from their reports can be both expensive and time-consuming. Instead of manual synthesis, the authors utilize GPT-4 to generate these descriptions automatically from the imaging reports, offering a scalable solution.\n\n3. **Benchmarked against general domain method: InstructPix2Pix**:\nIn the rapidly evolving field of image editing with natural language instruction, InstructPix2Pix has been a benchmark. However, models like InstructPix2Pix, trained on generic images and text, might not be optimally suited for the nuanced biomedical domain. MedJourney, in its extensive tests on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, not only compared its performance with methods tailored for the medical domain like RoentGen but also with general domain methods like InstructPix2Pix. The results showed that MedJourney substantially outperforms these state-of-the-art methods in both instruction image editing and medical image generation.\n\n4. **Authors gave an honest attempt at establishing quantitative evaluation metrics**:\nRecognizing the complexity and challenges associated with evaluating counterfactual medical image generation, the authors introduced an extensive suite of tests. These tests include evaluations based on various factors such as pathology, race, age, and spatial alignment. This can be certainly improved upon but it is at least a step in the right direction."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Comparison to more recent works that closely follow the instruction and reference image**:\nWhile MedJourney has shown promise in counterfactual medical image generation, it lacks a direct comparison with more recent works, such as \"Imagic: Text-Based Real Image Editing with Diffusion Models.\" Imagic, designed to closely follow instructions and reference images, is potentially better suited for the tasks that MedJourney addresses with medical images. A side-by-side comparison or integration of insights from Imagic could potentially strengthen the robustness and applicability of MedJourney.\n\n2. **Need for reader study in addition to quantitative metrics for qualitative evaluation of different methods**:\nWhile the authors have introduced a comprehensive suite of quantitative tests, the paper could benefit from a reader study that provides qualitative insights. Direct feedback from radiologists or medical experts on the interpretability, authenticity, and clinical utility of the counterfactual images would enhance the evaluation depth and offer a more holistic understanding of MedJourney's real-world applicability.\n\n3. **Ethical considerations and limitations are not discussed**:\nThe application of AI in the medical domain has inherent ethical implications. Given that counterfactual medical images could influence clinical decisions, the absence of a discussion on the ethical considerations and potential risks associated with MedJourney is a significant oversight. Addressing these concerns would not only ensure the safe deployment of such methods but also enhance trust among medical practitioners and patients.\n\n4. **How well does it apply to other medical image datasets?**\nWhile MedJourney's performance on the MIMIC-CXR dataset is commendable, its generalizability across diverse medical imaging modalities remains uncertain. Demonstrating its efficacy on a broader range of datasets, such as MRI, CT scans, or ultrasounds, would substantiate its versatility. Furthermore, insights into how the method adapts and performs across different diseases, anatomical regions, or imaging techniques would solidify its position as a universally applicable counterfactual medical image generation tool.\n\n5. **Minor edits**: All citations should be in parenthesis. In many place, the parenthesis are missing which messes up the main text. Please correct those.\n\n6. **Demographic diversity is crucial for medical datasets**: \nMedical datasets must accurately represent the diverse patient populations they serve to ensure that AI models generalize well across varied demographic groups. The authors acknowledge in the appendix that the dataset has an overrepresentation of the white elderly population. Such biases can inadvertently lead to models that perform sub-optimally or even erroneously for underrepresented groups, which can have significant clinical implications. Highlighting this limitation in the main body of the paper, especially in sections like 'Limitations' or 'Discussion,' would underscore the importance of demographic diversity. It would also serve as a call to action for researchers to actively pursue more balanced datasets, ensuring equitable healthcare outcomes for all patients regardless of their background.\n\n7. **Add FID as an additional metric**: Please add FID as an additional qualitative metric to evaluate different methods. See UnixGen and RoentGen paper for details on the FID metric."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper's enhancement primarily hinges on text processing and image registration, both of which raise concerns:\n\n- **Concerns with Text Processing using GPT-4**:\n    - **Validity of Disease Progression**: he paper does not indicate whether the disease progression generated by GPT-4 has been compared or verified against radiologists' opinions. Such a comparison is crucial for establishing the reliability of the generated progression description.\n    - **Lack of Sanity Checks**: There seems to be no mention of sanity checks for the progression generated between two images. Considering GPT-4's capability to generate progression even for unrelated images of different patients, it's vital to understand how the paper ensures the accuracy and relevance of these progressions.\n    - **Comparison between Impression Section and GPT-4 Usage**: The advantages of using GPT-4 over the impression section in reports are minimal (as evident in Table 2). Clarification on how the impression section was used and whether GPT-4 is actually essential for this study would be beneficial, given the marginal gains across metrics.\n\n- **Image Registration Contribution**:\n    - The substantial improvements seem to stem from image registration, primarily leveraging the SimpleITK toolkit (Beare et al. 2018). This raises concerns about the originality of the MedJourney method's contributions. An expanded discussion on how image registration was adapted for the proposed method would provide a clearer understanding of its impact.\n\nAdditional Question:\n\n- Concerning the pathology classifier, it's unclear which report's reference pathology labels are used. Are these labels compared with those generated in Cohen et al. 2021, which are used for assessing the counterfactual image model? Clarification on this process would be helpful.\n\n- **Prompt Requirement**: The necessity of the prompt \u201ca photo of chest x-ray\u201d is not justified. Including results without this prompt might offer more insight into its impact.\n\nMinor Issues:\n- There's a missing citation for GPT-4 in the related work section on page 3.\n- Figure 3 could be better placed in the experiments section, as it is not referenced beforehand.\n- Figure 1 is not referenced in the text.\n- Paper uses Figure and Fig. interchangeably."
