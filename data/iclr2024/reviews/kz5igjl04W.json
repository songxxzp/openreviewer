                "value": "I have two significant concerns with the work: (1) that the proposed method is applied too narrowly to be of interest to the broader ICLR community, and (2) that insufficient evidence has been provided to support the application-specific claims.\n\n**Narrow application of proposed methods**. The proposed CDEV method is applied to a single model trained on a small amount of data from a single unknown process. The model is even a fairly unconventional one, with (i) modeling assumptions (the specific use of 5 discrete inputs) rooted in rudimentary understanding of the data process (5 general classes of data), and (ii) an unconventional GAN setup called fiwGAN. The authors claim that \u201cthe proposed approach can be extended to other architectures and datasets.\u201d This may be true, although it would certainly be more convincing if the authors demonstrated this themselves. For example, corroboration of the CDEV method on a _known_ process (e.g. human speech) would inspire more confidence. The authors allude to related work on human speech, but while that work does inspire confidence in the generative modeling approach (GANs), it does not look at the CDEV algorithm specifically. Moreover, I have my doubts about the generality of the method, as domain knowledge appears to be a substantive input to the CDEV algorithm at several levels: (i) the model itself, (ii) the data selection process, (iii) the determining of appropriate extreme values, and (iv) the outcome functions used to measure average treatment effect.\n\n**Insufficient evidence to support claims**. Though I am certainly not an expert in this application domain, the authors appear to be making novel claims about the process they study, e.g., that mean spectral frequency is a salient property of sperm whale communication. It is not clear to me that all confounders have been ruled out to support this claim. For example, could it not be the case that fluctuations in mean spectral frequency have nothing to do with _communication_ but are instead caused by some other random source of noise (as an arbitrary example, changes in water temperature)? If this were true, the GAN would still need to produce such fluctuations to fit the data distribution, despite being irrelevant to communication. Another potential confounder: how do we rule out that the GAN simply failed to fit the underlying data distribution, and any interventional effects are simply a consequence of a poorly fit model?"

What is the key difference between using a generative model vs. just testing a hypothesis directly on the data distribution (e.g., showing that mean spectral frequency varies across examples in the dataset)?\n- How might we extend this method to the particular noise structure of diffusion models, which are more \u201cin vogue\u201d at the moment?\n- Figure 1 shows 0, 1 for t codes instead of -1, 1 as in the rest of the paper (this confused me especially w.r.t. choosing low extreme values of -1 rather than 0)"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "### **Unclear motivation**\nI have a general concern. What is the advantage of learning a representation (t,x) using a deep generative model in the hope that $t$ will represent some intuitive features (like number of clicks and click regularity), if these very features can be extracted from the raw data algorithmically (as is done in this work, for evaluation)? I understand that this is only to evaluate the disentanglement of the method, but if these intuitive features can be computed from the raw data, what\u2019s the point of trying to extract them in an unsupervised manner here in this application?\n\n### **Originality**\nAs I said above, I believe this work present an original application of disentangled representation learning. However, I don't see novel methodological contributions. The authors essentially trained an existing method and applied fairly standard qualitative evaluation strategies to assess disentanglement.\n\n### **Unclear use of the word \u201cdisentanglement\u201d**\n- The authors should clarify what they mean by disentanglement, since their definition (which I inferred from their experiment) seems different from the one I know and which is widely used: Typically, disentanglement means the following: every component of the latent representation influences one and only one interpretable factor of variation. \n- Figure 4: This does not correspond to the usual notion of \u201cdisentanglement\u201d. Here, all the dimensions of t have an impact on the number of clicks. The interesting thing is that it seems only one dimension of $t$ has a positive impact, while all the others have a negative impact. \n- Figure 5: I still believe this does not correspond to the usual notion of disentanglement, since, again, every dimension of t_i have an impact on the \u201cinter-click\u201d interval and the \u201ccoda regularity\u201d, it\u2019s just that one of the bits has a monotonic influence while the others are non-monotonic.\n\n### **Concerns with experiments**\nThe experiments did not convinced me that the fiwGAN algorithm can robustly discover natural factors of variations in the data:\n- Are the findings robust to reinitialization? I.e., if you rerun this experiment with multiple seeds, are you always finding similar patterns? I don\u2019t think the experiments show reruns. This is very important for such analysis, to avoid cherry-picking. \n- In Figure 4: the curves that go down seem to go up again after t = 10, do they end up being positive if we extend the range of t even further?\n- Surprising findings, in Figure 1: \u201cThe 9R type was never part of the training data, yet our network learns to generate codas that resemble this type (Sec. 4).\u201d I would like to see stronger evidence that the model can generate reasonable samples never seen during training. Was this sample cherry-picked?\n\n### **Unnecessary use of causal terminology**\nThe framing in terms of causal inference feels a bit unjustified, since one has full control over both x and t, so that there is not direct causal effect from x to t, making causal inference trivial.\n\n### **The work lacks clarity at times**\n- In intro: \u201cNetworks trained on raw speech data are shown to learn to associate lexical items with code values and sublexical structure with individual bits in $t$ \u2026\u201d the variable $t$ was not defined, so it\u2019s hard to follow what is meant here.\n- I found the description of fiwGAN a bit imprecise at the beginning of Section 2. I think it would help to write down explicitly the loss that is optimized, even if this is not part of your contribution.\n- Figure 2: The code t is binary, but the rest of the paper assumes t is Rademacher, i.e. with support {-1, 1} instead of {0, 1}. Which one is it?\n- Section 3: \u201cWe observe a high degree of entanglement (4) of the learned encodings within the range seen in training ([\u22121, 1]).\u201d I don\u2019t understand the meaning of \u201centanglement\u201d here. I now understand that this paragraph refers to experiments in Figure 4. I feel like the separation between theory/method and experiments is not clear enough here."

To make sure I understand the value of this paper correctly, let me ask the authors two questions.\n\n(1) The contribution of the explanation to the original data of the latent dimension specified in the 5 dimensions being extracted by fiwGAN. \nMy question is: Is it known how much the ATE of the number of clicks contributes to the representation of the observed data?\nMore specifically, does the fact that the bit with index 1 in the latent variable space (5 dimensions) responds well to ATE mean that ATE is the second principal component (in the sense of, say, principal component analysis)?\nIf so, I would be very interested in what elements are responding to the first principal component (i.e., the bit with index 0).\nI understand the part where the model is limited to 5 bits (32 classes) of characteristic coding space for the 5 coder types present in the data so that constructivity can be captured. Is the index of these bits tied to foresight knowledge such as the index of these 5 coder types? Or does the index of bits reflect some ranking of its expressive power, as in, for example, classical principal component partial analysis?\nThis may be a simple question that arises because I simply missed the description of the details.\n\n(2) Does the method of identifying causal structures analogous to dose-response, which the current proposed method does, also work for factor combinations?\nMy understanding is that the current causal structure is investigated separately for each factor, such as number of clicks, tones, etc. Is it not possible, for example, for a combination of those factors to have a new semantic meaning?\nIs it possible, for example, that \"a constant rhythm of low tones\" and \"a constant rhythm of high tones\" have different meanings? I imagine that it would be difficult to distinguish between the two with only one factor, \"constant rhythm,\" and that it might be difficult to tell without combining factors."
