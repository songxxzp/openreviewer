In this case, how to calculate the element-wise multiplication between $x_{G_s}$ and $L^2$?\n\n While I think the subgraph diffusion is a promising idea, the presentation of the method and experiments require a substantial amount of work and are not ready for ICLR24."

                "value": "1.\tThe authors first propose that the discrete geometric property of graphs makes it difficult to capture complex node-level dependencies for diffusion models. They claim that this problem can be solved by using subgraphs, which they present as the main contribution of this paper. I disagree with this viewpoint. Firstly, the existence of complex node-level dependencies has nothing to do with whether the data is discrete or continuous. Whether it is discrete atomic features or continuous positional features, complex node-level dependencies still exist. Secondly, while abstracting multiple nodes into subgraphs eliminates node dependencies, there can still be dependencies between subgraphs. However, the paper does not propose a solution for this subgraph dependency issue.\n2.\tThe authors' second contribution is the proposal that subgraph latent embedding with explicit supervision can bridge the gap between unconditional and conditional generation. However, the explicit supervision used in the paper is graph-level label, and I do not get the contribution of subgraph latent embedding. In other words, the proposed solution in the paper, such as pooling subgraph latent embedding as in Eq. 7, could be replaced by pooling node latent embedding to obtain graph latent embedding. I doubt the necessity of using subgraph latent embedding to bridge the gap between unconditional and conditional generation.\n3.\tThe description of the methods proposed in the paper is not clear enough. Two methods are proposed in the paper: subgraph-level equivariant architecture (SE-GNN) and head-alterable sampling strategy. Firstly, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how to implement L1 and L2 in SE-GNN. Secondly, in Section 4.2, the authors do not explain why it is called head-alterable, and it is not clear why this is considered a sampling strategy. From the beginning of page 6, this method changes the mean of the Gaussian distribution during the training phase. Additionally, the paper does not explain how to personalize the prior distribution for each property $y_i$, some equations to be presented.\n4.\tSome recent related works need to be compared, such as MDM [1].\n\n[1] Huang, Lei, et al. \"Mdm: Molecular diffusion model for 3d molecule generation.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
