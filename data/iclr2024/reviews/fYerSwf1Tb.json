The results are generally favorable for the proposed method, though not always statistically significant. \n\nAblations are included."

                "value": "1) The primary weakness is limited novelty. This is not the first paper to propose combining VAEs with Hawkes, e.g. \n- Sun et al. (2021) \"Towards a predictive analysis on disease progression: a variational Hawkes process model\" IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics\n- Lin et al. (2021) \"Disentangled deep multivariate hawkes process for learning event sequences\" ICDM\n- Pan et al. (2020) \"A variational point process model for social event sequences\" AAAI\nHence the primary point of novelty appears to be the scheme for sampling next events and the fact that using the logits is better than greedy sampling, which is not surprising.\n\n2) Related to this is then the fact that appropriate empirical baselines may be missing since previous work combining VAEs with Hawkes processes is not included. Aside from the above papers, there are also other more closely related approaches that should be included such as Zuo et al. (2020) \"Transformer Hawkes Process\" ICML and Miscouridou et al. (2022) Cox-Hawkes: doubly stochastic spatiotemporal\nPoisson processes TMLR.\n\n3) Even with the limited baselines, the empirical performance is not compelling (this might be less of a concern if the contribution was more novel). While the proposed method generally has the best performance, the confidence intervals often overlap with DDPM (both on downstream performance and classification of real vs synthetic instances) - this is somewhat confusing in the presentation of the results as \"best performance\" is bolded for multiple methods, but competing methods with overlapping confidence intervals are not bolded.\n\n4) While the method is well described intuitively, some specifics are not given in clear formal terms, e.g. greedy vs. logit sampling could be provided formally/mathematically, the equations for generating sequences in the encoder/decoder and combining them in the encoder should be provided."
