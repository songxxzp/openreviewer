Proposes two techniques - out-of-class entropy and top-k pruning - to encourage active out-of-class exploration by the student. \n\n- Inspired by curriculum learning, proposes curriculum distillation where the teacher gradually allows more out-of-class exploration via dynamic scheduling of distillation loss weights. \n\n- Achieves significant performance gains over strong baselines on seven benchmark graph datasets, demonstrating the ability to improve training and generalization of graph transformers.\n\nOverall, the work makes multiple innovations in adapting knowledge distillation for graph transformers in a semi-supervised node classification setting. The curriculum-based attention distillation framework is intuitive and achieves strong empirical results."

The curriculum scheduling strategies are grounded in educational learning principles. The improvements for out-of-class attention demonstrate thoughtful analysis.\n\n-  The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

How does performance vary for different teacher-student combinations?\n\n- While outperforming baselines, the absolute performance gaps are sometimes small (~1-2%). The gains may not justify the added complexity in some applications.\n\n- Curriculum scheduling adds hyperparameters like epoch boundaries. The impact of these hyperparameters could be studied more systematically. In addition, I highly recommend that authors use auto-distillation (KD-Zero: Evolving Knowledge Distiller for Any Teacher-Student Pairs (NeurIPS-2023, Automated Knowledge Distillation via Monte Carlo Tree Search (ICCV2023)) to optimize different parameter options.\n\n\n- Attention distillation for other graph model families besides transformers could also be promising but is not explored. It is essential to incorporate a thorough discussion of relevant KD-related studies, including Self-Regulated Feature Learning via Teacher-free Feature Distillation (ECCV2022), NORM: Knowledge Distillation via N-to-One Representation Matching (ICLR2023), Shadow Knowledge Distillation: Bridging Offline and Online Knowledge Transfer (NIPS2022), DisWOT: Student Architecture Search for Distillation Without Training (CVPR2023) . This discussion will help position the proposed approach within the existing literature, establish connections, and provide valuable insights for potential comparisons."
