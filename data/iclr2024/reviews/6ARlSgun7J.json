Calibrated Scores\nIts well known that pairwise ranking losses (e.g., Equation (10) of this submission) is shift-invariant hence may not produce calibrated scores, as pointed out by [1]. Why not considering point-wise loss functions or hybrid objectives [1] (listwise Softmax + pointwise BCE) to produce more calibrated scores?\n\n## 2. Experiment Settings and Results\n(1) What's the model size for each method in Table 1 and Table 2? The model size should include every component needed to do inference. For example, does ELIAS and ELIAS+LEVER have the same model size, as LEVER is just in-place modifying the OVA classifiers of LEVER? If not, I am concern about the performance gain of LEVER is due to additional model capacity. \n\n(2) In Table 1, ELIAS+LEVER achieved >20% absolute gain on LF-AOL-270K in P@3 and P@5. If not a typo, any insight why such significant gain? Similar questions to ELIAS+LEVER on LF-Wiki-1M, PSP metrics.\n\n(3) On page 9, the author claims the training time of LEVER only increased by at most 2x. Does that include (a) training time of teacher bi-encoders (b) prediction time of teacher bi-encoder to generate soft-labels (c) training time of student OVA classifiers which are trained by not only sparse ground truth labels but also dense soft-labels? If so, what's the detailed breakdown in terms of those three components?\n\n(4) Suppose the ground truth label matrix is a sparse $N \\times L$ matrix. How dense are the soft-labels generated by LEVER? Does the performance of LEVER vary when using different top-$k$ soft-labels per input?\n\n## 3. Macro-averaged Evaluation Metrics\nTo properly measure the performance of long-tailed labels, text classification community often consider Macro-average Precision/Recall/F1 metrics [2,3,4]. The author should also report Macro-averaged metrics to further validate the major claim of LEVER, which is the the performance gain on tailed-labels.\n\n\n## Reference\n\n[1] Yan et al.

This principle forms the foundation for the LEVER framework, which employs an additional teacher network to provide accurate estimates of $p_x$.\n\n   If we have a model that provides good estimates $p_x$ then we don't need to train another one, the XMLC task is already solved! The strength of the method seems to lay in the properly selected trade-off between loss calculated on hard observed labels and soft labels coming from the teacher network that seems to be much better on tail-labels thanks to leveraging labels-side information. \n\n4. From the appendix, I understand that $\\lambda = 0.05$ (the variable that weights the hard and soft part of the loss) was used for all the experiments. Since the choice of $\\lambda$ seems to be crucial for the method.

The paper builds a connection with an existing work (Menon et al. 2021), on which it heavily relies, for most of the motivation, to propose a variance reduction strategy (Theorem 1 in the paper & discussion thereafter) and hence improvement in the generalization error. \n\nThe focus of the approach (generalization analysis) is on the last/classification layer of the network. The above generalization analysis leads to an augmented objective which, in addition to standard hard labels, also consists of a loss term consisting of soft labels from a teacher model, for which recent frameworks based on Siamese training are exploited. The proposed approach is tested on a range of datasets from the extreme classification repository, and it is shown that the proposed approach leads to significant improvements in the prediction performance in terms of P@k and PSP@k metrics. The augmentation strategy is also compared to existing methods for data augmentation in extreme classification to further demonstrate its general applicability."

The main shortcoming of the paper is the lack of novelty in the main idea and the approach :\n\n1a) In terms of the content i.e. the main theoretical results such as Theorem 1, its proof, the idea to reduce variance for improving generalization, using soft-labels in teacher-student setup has already been explored in the existing work of Menon et al 2021. It seems that the paper attempts to build a loose bridge between this earlier theoretical work to build a weighting scheme and soft-labels (equation 9). \n\n1b) The paper claims that the variance issue for tail-labels has not been explored so far. However, this seems not quite true, as a similar concern has been raised in the earlier work Babbar and Scholkopf 2019, where there was a similar argument that due to the lack of data in tail-labels, for a given class label, there is high variance between the input features between two samples. \n\n2) There also seems to be a lack of consistency in terms of using the symbols and notation in many places. For instance, X is used in Section 3.1 to denote a (random?) instance in the input space $\\mathcal{X}$. However, the same is used to limit the norm of x in the same section. For equation (1), should the LHS also not be conditioned on x i.e. V[y|x]. It is not clear why there are two different symbols for the sub-script (small-case) x. Why the equation (6) is defined in terms of a trained classifier w*, while the standard generalization results are stated in terms of all possible classifiers in the hypothesis class. The theorem statement needs to be on a better formal footing as done in the original paper Menon et al. 2021, the current version is incomplete and unclear.\n\n3. In terms of properly citing related work, the paper falls somewhat short. For instance, the paper introduces the need to use calibrated losses without a proper justification to use calibrated losses or a reference thereof. It does not seem to be in the sense of the word used in the last sentence of page 1. Another concern is the lack of setting the right context for the cited papers.  As mentioned above, the high variance problem for tail-labels has also been explored. As another instance, the work of Schultheis et al. 2022 is cited but the correct context is in the related work section when discussing Missing and Tail-labels in Section 2.2, and not only later down in discussing coverage as a metric. Even though the paper has been cited, it is not in the right context. In terms of the main classifier, the focus of the paper is on one-vs-rest approaches, while DiSMEC which initiated this approach in extreme settings isn\u2019t referred."
