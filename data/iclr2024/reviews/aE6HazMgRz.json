Existing spatio-temporal forecasting approaches based on complex architectures like Transformers have limitations in long-term scenarios due to information loss during semantics exploration and iterative rollouts. To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes a new approach called Spatio-temporal Twins with a Cache (STAC) for long-term system dynamics modeling. STAC comprises a frequency-enhanced spatial module and an ODE-enhanced temporal module that investigates spatio-temporal relationships from complementary perspectives. The information from these twin modules is fused using channel attention to generate informative feature maps. To enhance long-term prediction, a cache-based recurrent propagator is introduced to store and utilize previous feature maps. The paper introduces a new flame flow field benchmark and conducts comprehensive validations across 14 benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that STAC outperforms other methods in long-term spatio-temporal prediction and partial differential equation-solving challenges. The contributions of the paper include the construction of a fire dynamics benchmark, the incorporation of cache memory concept into long-term system modeling, the proposal of a novel framework, and extensive experiments showcasing the effectiveness of STAC."

Lack of truly innovative contributions: While the paper introduces several components and techniques, such as FSM, OTM, IFTM, CRP, Fourier-based Spectral Filters, teacher forcing, adversarial learning, and the new FIRE dataset, only CRP and IFTM can be considered as relatively novel contributions. The other techniques mentioned are already known and used in existing methods, which may limit the originality and novelty of the proposed approach.\n\n2. Limited explanation for the CRP technique: The paper mentions the use of a cache-based recurrent propagator (CRP) to prevent forgetting previous events and enhance long sequence prediction. However, it does not provide a clear explanation of the key parameter \"$\\alpha$\" and whether it is a learnable parameter. Additionally, CRP's similarity to traditional RNNs raises questions about its parallelization capabilities and potential limitations.\n\n3. Artificial handling and limited interpretability of IFTM: The separation of temporal and spatial processing, as well as the channel-independent merging in IFTM, appears to be a forced transformation without much interpretability. The lack of learnable factors and reliance on manual processing may hinder the scalability and extensibility of the method.\n\n4. Potential loss of spatial information in FSM: FSM applies different treatments to the same data and forcibly merges them, potentially leading to a loss of spatial information. Additionally, the direct fully connected mapping of the segmented data raises concerns about the preservation of spatial relationships and the possibility of information loss."

STAC just combines a series of advanced models, including FNO, Vision Transformer, Neural ODE and a similar recall mechanism proposed by E3D-LSTM. The proposed training strategy is also in a combination style. For me, it is hard to find the novel part in this model.\n\nNote that I am not attempt to enforce the authors to build a completely new model or block. I just think they fail in illustrating their advantages beyond other models. For example, they should consider the following questions:\n\n-\tWhy should they combine vision transformer and FNO? FNet [1] has shown that the feedforward layer can perform like FFT. Why not just only use Transformer or FNO?\n\n-\tWhy can Neural ODE capture the continuous dynamics? I know that Neural ODE can achieves the adaptive depth or adaptive temporal interval. But according to the equation and code, I think the usage here is equivalent to a simple rk4 algorithm. It is hard to claim that they learn the continuous dynamic feature. Besides, They don\u2019t present the necessity in using Neural ODE.\n\n-\tAre the experimental datasets temporally irregular? According to the paper, I think the input sequences are equally collected along the temporal dimension.\n\n-\tAbout the cache-based design.
