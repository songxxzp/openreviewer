                "value": "The author highlights that while transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks related to predicting graph properties, their application has been restricted to small-scale graphs due to computational limitations. Additionally, the author contends that the existing neighbor sampling method constrains the model's ability to consider more global information. Consequently, this paper introduces a comprehensive GT framework, with a focus on enhancing model capacity and scalability. The proposed framework, known as LargeGT, combines a rapid neighborhood sampling technique with a local attention mechanism and an approximate global codebook. Extensive experiments illustrate that by integrating local and global attention mechanisms, LargeGT achieves improved performance in node classification tasks. Notably, LargeGT demonstrates a 3\u00d7 speedup and a 16.8% performance enhancement in specific node classification benchmarks when compared to their closest baseline models."

Notably, key terms and important experimental findings have been highlighted using various colors, resulting in an effective visual presentation.\n\n2. The experimental results presented in this paper indicate that the proposed framework can achieve superior performance within a shorter training time.\n\n3. The author introduces two significant challenges associated with handling large-scale graphs: scalability and constraints related to local information aggregation. These issues are prevalent and indeed worth discussing. As the author pointed out, computational resource requirements increase quadratically with the growing number of nodes. To address this, the author has proposed both a local and a global aggregation module. The former employs conventional sampling techniques to learn local representations, while the latter focuses on deriving insights from global node vector projections. Downstream predictions are then made based on both sets of representations. The problems raised, and the respective solutions are meaningful and coherent with each other."

                "value": "Despite the fluent presentation, some concerns arise in this paper. Firstly, the level of novelty in this framework appears limited. It is apparent that this paper heavily relies on the previous work, GOAT, particularly the global module, which encodes mini-batch nodes using global graph nodes. This component was introduced in a prior paper. The other aspects are mainly focused on aligning local and global features. The framework appears more like an updated version of GOAT than a fundamentally new invention.\n\nMoreover, in the experimental section, the comparison between the LG transformer and other baselines reveals that the proposed framework doesn't consistently outperform GOAT-local, especially in the ogbn-products dataset. Furthermore, in the ogbn-papers100M dataset, the framework is only compared to a single baseline. It's possible that other methods struggle with extremely large graphs, but there are likely additional viable solutions that should be explored.\n\nAdditionally, the fusion of transformers and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a dynamic research area with various ongoing studies, such as TransGNN and Graphformers. It would be valuable to understand how these methods perform when confronted with similar tasks.\n\nLastly, the author emphasizes the significance of combining local and global representations. However, apart from GOAT, there are other techniques that can address this challenge, such as randomly selecting both nearby neighbors and global features. The author should offer further clarification on this matter."

It would be beneficial to include more in-depth discussions and comparisons with transformer-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Additionally, it is important to address how other approaches perform in terms of extracting global information from the graph.\n\nExpanding on these aspects would enhance the paper's contribution and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the research landscape in this domain."

Baselines: LargeGT is compared to \"constrained versions\" of various baselines, notably all models are constrained to 2 hops only, while LargeGT has access to 4-hops worth of neighbors (in the local module). Including the non-constrained versions of these same baselines is critical for evaluation, even if they are more computationally demanding. Currently it is unclear whether adopting LargeGT leads to lower performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, at the expense of computational efficiency.\n2. Additionally, no auxiliary label propagation or augmentations are used for the baseline methods, when they are used in methods reported in the OGB leaderboard. These enhancements are not altering the receptive field of the baselines, and thus shouldn't impact computational performance, but might improve classification performance. This should be taken into account when comparing with approaches that might still outperform the proposed method, even under constrained training (2-hop). \n3. The main innovation can seemingly be credited to the use of the global codebook, so it is hard to define the main contribution of this work. If the focus of this work is combining all these different building blocks into a compute efficient framework, I would expect to see a more expansive breakdown of the computational costs of different components, memory usage and requirements. Notably, how is \"Epoch time\" defined in Figure 2? All models might be processing different amounts of data and thus might have different definitions of an \"epoch\" due to differences in sampling strategies. How many nodes does each model process in an epoch? Different models might require different numbers of epochs to converge, shouldn't total training time be more important?\n4.
