Second, an imbalanced gate loss is proposed for HMoE, motivated by the prior that most of the 3D points are unoccupied. It enables the gating network of HMoE to accurately dispatch the unoccupied and occupied points. Third, an explicit density loss is introduced to guide the gating network. Then, the occupancy of the entire large-scale scene can be encoded into a very compact gating network of the HMoE. With the learned occupancy as guidance for empty space skipping, our method can consistently obtain 2.5\u00d7 speed-up on the state-of-the-art method Switch-NeRF, while achieving highly competitive performances on several challenging large-scale benchmarks."

This paper only compares a grid representation with a resolution of 128^3. Even under this setup, the improvement of S+Ours over S+Grid is minor and even worse in PSNR on Residence (S+Grid 22.18 vs S+Ours 22.10), as shown in Table 3.\n\nI think using a larger resolution (e.g., 256) of the grid can achieve better results. I understand that using a large resolution, dense grid will occupy more memory. In this case, this method should compare with the more efficient hashgrid representation, which can represent a very high-resolution grid (e.g., 1024) with small memory and be optimized in a small amount of time (typically a few minutes on a single GPU). In comparison, the proposed occupancy method requires 1.6h to 1.8h to train on 8 NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs. \n\nOverall, I feel that this method is heavy and the advantages over existing representations are very limited."

According to Section 4.5 HMoE, the reconstruction quality droped with MoE (The empty expert is as large as scene experts). \n(a) I believe it is the density loss that enforces the small sigma for empty points. If a larger empty expert leads to failure, that means the density loss is invalid / not-effective.\n(b) If a larger empty expert fails, the authors need to justify how \"small\" the empty expert should be. It would be impractical if the HMoE is sensitive to the network design. Probably it requires different network designs when working with different scenes.\n\n2. I am confused about the statement \"we can use our frozen occupancy network to guide the sampling and training of NeRF methods\". The occupancy network can be trained end-to-end according to the design. Why do we need to freeze the occupany network and train the nerf models again? \n\n3. Unfair experiment design. Most experiments are of fixed training time, e.g. 23.8h for Table 2, 12-15h for Table 3. Indeed the HMoE gives better results with limited training time. However, we need to compare the final result with enough training time. Does the HMoE still out-performs the baselines with enough training time, e.g., 40+ hours for Table 2 & 3.\n\n4. For Figure 2, why do we need an empty space expert? Why do we need sigma and RGB if we believe a point is empty? An obvious alternative is that occupancy network serves as a classifier. That is:\n(a) Remove the empty space expert\n(b) The empty points do not involve in the rendering, in another word, set \\sigma=0 if a point is predicted as empty."
