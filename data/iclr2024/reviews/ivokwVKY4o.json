Technically, these additional constraints are enforced using Lagrange multipliers. Additionally, a novel branching heuristic, BBPS, is introduced that leverages precomputed linear bounds as \"shortcuts\" to compute better approximations of the branching effect. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on a wide variety of activation functions."

Can tighter bounds there not lead to tighter bounds in later nodes and thus changing relaxations?\n3) What is the impact of the branching factor $K$ on the resulting precision? Can you ablate its effect on one of the CIFAR10 networks, where branching was particularly effective? Can the same neuron be split multiple times in your framework?\n\n### Conclusion \nThe authors successfully establish the effectiveness of BaB for general non-linearities and the advantages of their novel branching heuristic on a wide range of benchmarks and compared to a diverse set of baselines. While the technical novelty seems limited, I believe that demonstrating the applicability and effectiveness of established techniques in this setting is a valuable contribution in itself and am thus leaning to accept the paper. However, I believe the authors should make sure that novel contributions (Section 3.2 and 3.4) are clearly distinguished from prior work (Section 3.1 and 3.3), and have thus reduced my score. I am happy to raise it once this concern is addressed."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the work is definitely of interest to the practitioners in the area, the vast majority of the presented material is a fairly straightforward extension of very well known concepts in the literature. It would not appear to me that the extensions presented great technical challenges that needed to be overcome. Indeed, while branch-and-bound is mostly employed on piece-wise nonlinearities in the context of neural network verification, it is a fairly general concept which the authors simply instantiated on more variants of the neural network verification problem.\n\nMore in detail, the support of more nonlinearities in the bounding phase is a trivial applications of concepts presented in (Zhang et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020). And, in practice, the $\\alpha$-$\\beta$-CROWN already extended the concept of optimizable linear bound propagation beyond ReLU (through support for sigmoid and tanh). As a result, extending these ideas to more nonlinearities is quite incremental. Similarly, previous work has already extended activation splitting to non-ReLU activations (Henriksen and Lomuscio, 2020). I believe this incrementality should be acknowledged more in the motivational sections of the paper.\nWhile the branching part could have more room for improvement, the authors focus on extending a relatively old branching heuristic (BaBSR) that is typically preferred by more effective strategies in state-of-the-art works (FSB in $\\beta$-CROWN, and the custom strategy introduced in MN-BaB). Furthermore, the authors do not justify the use of ternary branching (k=3) with uniform spacing between the branching points.\n\nThe experimental results are also on mostly toy problems and with fairly small perturbation sizes (1/255 as opposed to 2/255 and 8/255 typically employed in the literature on CIFAR-10). The authors sometimes select the properties to verify by excluding the properties that would be verified by CROWN (for instance, table 3). Taking the above into account, I am not sure how significant some of the improvements with respect to pre-existing work are (for instance, $\\alpha$-$\\beta$-CROWN without branching on Figure 2 and table 3).\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that most of the merit of the work pertains to the implementation. I am not sure this meets the bar for an ICLR publication."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Could the authors justify their choice for ternary (and uniform) branching? For instance, an ablation study on the number of branching points would be useful.\n\n- I found the explanation of the branching strategy to be quite confusing. For instance, the presentation of BaBSR heavily differs from the one from the original authors, which is based on computing coefficients that estimate the impact of splitting on the last layer bounds from the (Wong and Kolter 2018) paper. Could the authors explain why the two presentations are equivalent?"
