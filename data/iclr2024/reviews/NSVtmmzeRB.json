Why does minimizing this value lead to the correct parameters for the proposed model? It is difficult to verify the mathematical consistency of the model without these derivations. Second, the proof of Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 3.2 appear to be incomplete. For example, the proof of Theorem 3.1 ends mid-sentence. Moreover, I do not see anywhere a proof of translation invariance, only rotation invariance via the matrix $\\mathbf{R}$. Additionally, how does Lemma C.1 establish Eq. 23? There appears to be major steps that are skipped in this proof. \n\n- It is not entirely clear why Bayesian Flow Networks improve the performance of modelling 3D tasks (or perhaps specifically molecular generation tasks).

While in diffusion-based models, the marginal is in an entropy-decrease fashion, e.g., from a high-variance Gaussian distribution N (0, I ) to the data distribution.\" This sentence is very unclear to me. Additionally, the reasoning does not entirely connect for me. Isn't $\\theta$ obtained from $\\mathbf{y}$, which is an inherently noisy variable (i.e. Eq. 2)? So why do the authors claim that it has low entropy?\n\nAre there any architectural / data preprocessing differences between the diffusion models (e.g. EDM) and the proposed GeoBFN? Are all improvements in performance attributable to the new training / sampling algorithm given by the Bayesian Flow Networks formulation [1]? Though the derivation is different, the training loss (Eq. 19) ultimately looks very similar to a diffusion model loss.\n\nCan the authors provide a clear formulation of the training algorithm (e.g., via a latex algorithmic block) so it is more clear what is being calculated?"
