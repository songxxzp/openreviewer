The frequency-aware transformer is realized by two modules, FDWA and FMFFN. Have you tried these two mechanisms in the entropy model? Entropy model plays a crucial role in learned image compression. In my opinion, it is more important to capture frequency component in entropy model. It would be a great improvement if the frequency-aware mechanism works."

When you set the block size responding to the maximum window size in FDWA, does it mean that the FMFFN is used to refine the high-frequence of features?\n \n3. If the decomposition of window size works, how about directly using different sizes of convolution?"

Can the authors explain what the (1), (2), (3) in the table mean here.\n\n2. Adding a transformer on the codec side would result in a longer training time and a larger memory requirement that is not hardware-friendly for the actual deployment of the compression model. Can the authors provide the training time as well as the corresponding average and peak memory consumption for both training and test? Besides, the three methods compared in Table 5 are all transformer-based methods, and there is no comparison of decoding time with, for example, Minnen[1] and GMM[2], where both the encoder and decoder use a CNN structure.\n\n[1] Minnen D, Singh S.
