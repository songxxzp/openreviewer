The ground truth label in training the ensemble neural network is however the harmonic mean of the 4 standard methods. In Fig. 3 the performance of the Ensemble method is compared to the single feature selection tasks. To really judge, whether the ensemble neural network approach is a significant contribution, one would however need a comparison to the SNPs ranked by the harmonic mean described above (since this is the ground truth in all supervised selection tasks). Additionally, there is a problem with the statistical evaluation of significance, since one cannot assume independence of folds over the different cross-validation runs, which would be necessary in order to apply the t-test (it is also not shown that the other assumptions of the test are fulfilled.\n\nThe SNPs are then used with three different graph neural network approaches to predict breast cancer risk. Here the performance is not compared to state-of-the-art in breast cancer risk prediction.\n\nFurthermore, the performance metric used does not seem ideal for the task at hand, because there is a high class imbalance and (ROC) AUC can be affected in those scenarios. The authors should at least give additional metrics like area under precision recall curve.\n\nThere is also a problem with the definition of the Hamming distance. The way it is written it is a similarity, not a distance. After normalizing (dividing by K), one could turn it into a distance by subtracting it from one, but that is not how it is defined in the manuscript. Furthermore, the D_{i,j}s are used to create the labels for the graph-based approaches and there a threshold of 0.5 is applied, implying that the \"normalized\" D_{i,j} is used. My recommendation would be to define the distance as described above and then create an edge for the nodes with distance smaller than 0.5. One would just have to define the weights differently."
