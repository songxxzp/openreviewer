Based on this observation, the author proposed GLBW, constructed as a combination of benign, backdoor, and generalization losses to generate generalized samples for training a poisoned model. The author showed that the poisoned model trained with GLBW has better benign accuracy and watermark success rate compared to the baselines. Also, they showed that their standardized version of the backdoor-based saliency map evaluation method has a lower variance than the vanilla method."

In other words, the watermark region is treated as a ground truth of the saliency map. Meanwhile, the author claims that the existence of potential triggers is a problem because it has almost zero cross-entropy loss, but their visualization differs from the original trigger. However, for me, it is unclear why the potential triggers should be considered in evaluating XAI based on watermark regions. For example, assume that there is a cat image and a poisoned model predicts it as a cat. If the prediction results changed by adding a watermark on the image, then it is due to the watermark in a high probability. \n- Limitation of IoU based evaluation methods\n  - Since the saliency map is not a segmentation, comparing the ground truth segmentation label with the saliency map could not be the best evaluation method. The classifier would not uniformly refer to the ground truth area.\n- Week explanation for the intention of BWTP/GLBW\n  - Many of the details of BWTP and GLBW are in the appendix, which makes it hard to understand them at first sight. \u2028\n\n- Minor corrections\n  - In Eq (1), $\\mathcal{L}$ receives $y\\in${$0,...,K-1$} for benign and backdoor loss, but $\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^K$ for penalty loss. \n  - In Eq (2), $|\\mathbf{b}'| is not defined"
