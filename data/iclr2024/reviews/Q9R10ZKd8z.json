I believe that the approach focuses more on creating K distinct solutions and utilizing them to build a baseline and find the best solution, which is closer to an exploitation strategy for policy learning than generating diverse solutions.\n\n3. I understand that the training uses the best-performing solution among the K solutions, and it seems like the policy learned in this way might tend to overfit to that best solution, improving its performance rather than generating diverse solutions.\n\n4. What is the reason for the effectiveness of the shared baseline composed of K generated solutions?\n\n5. I'm curious about the reason why solution uniqueness is higher in PolyNet compared to POMO. Since there doesn't appear to be a mechanism to explicitly increase uniqueness in the objective function, I wonder if there is causality in the results. I'm also interested in understanding why high uniqueness is desirable when, ultimately, only the best solution is used. Why is it necessary to have diverse solutions?\n\n6. If K vectors are not used, and K solutions are generated using the same policy and the same approach, what would be the resulting outcome?"

The approach demonstrates that by using a single decoder, the performance of the POMO model can be enhanced at a relatively small cost.

                "value": "Significance and novelty:\n\n* The technical novelty is slightly limited. The idea of enhancing diversity (similar to EAS [3] and FER [4])  and the integration of additional trainable layers in the POMO decoder (similar to EAS [3] and PMOCO [5]) is not new. \n* The addressed TSP and CVRP are relatively small-scale. Many recent works can solve much larger sizes like 10,000 nodes, e.g., DIFUSCO [6].\n\nEvaluation:\n* PolyNet added a new residual block to the POMO pre-trained model decoder for further training. However, the baseline models, POMO, Poppy and EAS, did not seem to undergo such extended training. The baseline models should also be trained further for a fair comparison. \nMeanwhile, it is unclear how long the additional training is. It is also unclear why PolyNet was not trained from scratch. It's interesting to understand how its performance is when training from scratch.\n* It is unclear whether the good performance is attributed to EAS, additional training, or the added layers with bit vector inputs. More evaluation may be needed, e.g., testing PolyNet\u2019s performance over longer inference without EAS, comparing the results of training from scratch and/or additional training (baselines also undergo extended training), and verifying the necessity of the proposed residual block design (e.g., can we change the bit inputs to random values? Can the hyper-network of PMOCO with additional training achieve similar performance?)\n* In Figure 4, it seems that both POMO and PolyNet display comparable levels of diversity, though PolyNet found solutions with lower costs. This appears to contradict the primary intention behind PolyNet, which is to amplify diversity. The results raise the question of whether the enhanced performance of PolyNet is due to diversity or if other underlying factors at play contribute to this outcome. \n\nWriting:\n\nThe title and some claims have inaccuracies. For instance, the title and other sections mention \u201capplicability to a wider range of CO problems\u201d, but all experiments are conducted only on VRPs. The paper claims that it focuses on practical problems that have many constraints, but the experiments are limited to simple problems like CVRPTW and CVRP. The paper also mentions an \"unlimited learnable policy\", but the number of decoders is restricted by K. \n\n```\nReferences:\n[1] POMO: Policy Optimization with Multiple Optima for Reinforcement Learning\n[2] Population-Based Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization\n[3] Efficient Active Search for Combinatorial Optimization Problems\n[4] Learning Feature Embedding Refiner for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems\n[5] Pareto Set Learning for Neural Multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization\n[6] DIFUSCO: Graph-based Diffusion Solvers for Combinatorial Optimization\n```"
