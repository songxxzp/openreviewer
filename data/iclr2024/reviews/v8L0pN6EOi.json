However, there are many other tasks such as essay writing and story generation where it can be hard to provide such feedback. Therefore, it is unclear if the method is generalizable.\n3.

In the paper, the authors stated, \"The small-scale base models are similar in design to GPT-4, but they were pretrained with roughly 200 times less compute.\" However, the paper neither reveals the size of the small-scale base models nor the large-scale base models.  It is unclear whether the data gets the PRM to work or the scale of the model that gets it to work. I understand that work done at industry has its confidentiality rules to follow, but the authors can maybe conduct experiments on open models on their pretraining and fine-tuning datasets? Due to the reproducibility issue, I think this work would be a better fit for a blog post than a main conference paper.\n2.
