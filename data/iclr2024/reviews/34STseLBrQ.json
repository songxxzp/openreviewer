Past results have shown that the DeepSets architecture can represent any permutation-invariant continuous function when $D = 1$ as long as $L \\geq D$, and that $L \\geq \\exp(\\Omega(\\min(\\sqrt{N}, D)))$ is necessary under certain assumptions about the $\\phi$ and $\\rho$ being implementable with analytic activation functions. This work shows that without these activation restrictions, permutation-invariant continuous functions can be exactly represented using embedding dimension $L = \\text{poly}(N, D)$. \n\nThey do so by introducing a pair of positive results in Theorem 3.1, one having a power mapping activation (where each input is mapped to its powers up to degree $N$) and another having an exponential activation. The constructions use a similar proof structure, both of which involve finding $\\phi$ that that the function $X \\mapsto \\sum_i \\phi(x_i)$ is continuous and invertible, which makes it possible to invert the mapping in $\\rho$ and then apply the permutation-invariant function directly. (Note that this means that, while $\\phi$ is a simple construction that can be made explicit, the inversion of $\\rho$ is an existential result that may correspond to a highly non-smooth function.) The feature mapping $\\phi$ is constructed carefully to ensure that inputs that are element-wise permutation-invariant but *not* vector-wise permutation-invariant map to different features; the authors do so by using *anchor* vectors to distinguish each vector. The remainder of the construction is dedicated to ensuring that some anchor exists for every possible input and that the desired constraints are enforced.\n\nThey contextualize their results by including several negative results to illuminate their design decisions, including Lemma 3.4 (why $\\rho$ and $\\phi$ must be continuous) and Theorem 4.5 (why there must be at least $D$ candidate anchor vectors for each input to have an anchor). They run brief experiments in Appendix K that train DeepSets models to compute lexicographical medians, and find that the necessary width $L$ grows polynomially in $N$ and $D$."

Perhaps the lower bounds could be mentioned separately, for the sake of clarity? \n* Page 17 says \"pigeon-hold\" instead of \"pigeon-hole.\"\n* Lemma E.1 is much easier to parse after noting Remark E.2.

The basic parameters relevant for the model are N and D; N denotes the size of the input set and D denotes the dimension of its elements. The novelty of this work is in proving a poly(N,D) upper bound on the latent dimension sufficient for DeepSets to express *any* permutation-invariant function. Previously known bounds were exponential in the relevant parameters N and D.\n\nTo elaborate, the DeepSets architecture is of the form $g(x) = \\rho(\\sum_{i=1}^N \\phi(x^i))$, where $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^D \\to \\mathbb{R}^L$ is a feature map for the set elements $x^i \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$, and $\\rho: \\mathbb{R}^L \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is an activation function.

The combinatorial argument presented in the proof of Lemma 4.4 is particularly nice, though it is somewhat difficult to follow in the current exposition. Overall, I find the proofs insightful and quite surprising (I will elaborate on this below). Hence, I am inclined to accepting this paper.\n\nThe proof of the main result can be understood in stages. Let $\\Phi(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\phi(x^i)$, where $x^i$ denotes D-dimensional vectors which are elements of the given \u201cset\u201d X. The ultimate goal is to design $\\Phi : \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times D}$ such that $\\Phi(X) = \\Phi(X\u2019)$ implies $X \\sim X\u2019$, where $A \\sim B$ means that the two matrices are equivalent up to row permutations (the opposite implication is obvious). The key difficulty is in \u201csurviving\u201d the sum-pooling operation $\\sum_{i=1}^N$.\n\nIdeas from previous work, such as the degree-N polynomial mapping $\\psi(z) = (z, z^2, z^3, \\ldots, z^N)$, can be applied entrywise to ensure that $\\Phi(X) = \\Phi(X\u2019)$ implies that the rows of X and X\u2019 are equivalent *individually*, which is a weaker implication than $X \\sim X\u2019$. This only works only in the D=1 case and not for D > 1 since $X \\sim X\u2019$ requires the coordinates of the rows $x^i$ be *jointly* aligned. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose novel ideas in the design of $\\Phi$ so that alignment between the coordinates of $x^i$ are ensured as well. Personally, I found this issue of coordinate-wise alignment quite challenging and was pleased to see its resolution here."

The work builds up on the ideas proposed in DeepSet, which shows that proves any permutation-invariant continuous function, can be restated by mapping each element to a vector, summing those vectors, and then mapping them to a scalar again. This paper addresses the unresolved question, whether sets over high-dimensional vectors can be represented efficiently, i.e., polynomially wrt to the set and feature size. \n\nMore formally, $X\\in R^{N\\times D}$ represents $N$ feature vectors of dimension $D,$ and function $f:R^{N\\times D} \\to R$ is defined to be permutation-invariant if for any permutation matrix $P$ it satisfies $f(P X) = f(X).$  The main contributions of the paper can be enumerated as\n- Thm 3.1 asserts that there $\\phi:R^D\\to R^L$ and $\\rho:R^L\\to R$ such that $f$ can be re-written as $f(X) = \\rho(\\sum_{i=1}^N \\phi(x^{(i)}))$ where $L$ is at most polynomial wrt to $N$ and $D$, with two different constructions that authors refer to as \"power mapping \" and exponential activation\". The theorem further asserts that $L$ is lower-bounded roughly by $ND$. \n- Thm 5.1 further shows that permutation equivariant functions, i.e., $f:R^{N\\times D}\\to R^{N\\times D'}$ such that  $f(P X) = P f(X),$ then there are $\\phi:R^D\\to R^L$ and $\\rho:R^D\\times R^L\\to R$ such that $f(X)_j = \\rho\\left(x^{(j)}, \\sum_i^N \\phi(x^{(i)})\\right)$ where again $L$ is polynomial in $N$ and $D$. \n\n## Technical summary \n\n*Set representation for one-dimensional elements $D=1$* The previous result proves that when $D=1$ there are $\\phi:R\\to R^L$ and $\\rho:R^L\\to R$ such that $f = \\rho(\\sum_i^N \\phi(x_i)$). This result mostly hinges on a particular function, referred to as power-mapping $\\Psi_N :R^N\\to R^N$, defined as  $\\Psi_N(X)_k = \\sum_i^N (x^{(i)} )^k.$ The paper goes on to explain that $\\Psi_N$ is \"bijective\" in a particular sense that deviates from the standard definition, in that $\\Psi_N(X) = \\Psi_N(X')$ implies rows of $X$ are a permutation of $X'.$ This allows us to introduce the mapping and its inverse as an identity and conclude $ f = f \\circ \\Psi_N^{-1} \\circ \\Psi_N  = \\rho(\\sum_i^N \\phi(X))$ where $\\rho:= f\\circ \\Psi_N^{-1}$ and $\\phi:= \\psi_N$. \n\n*The channel alignment problem in $D\\ge 2$* The first insight is explaining that the straightforward approach of representing each channel (dimension) of the high-dimensional features, will not work. This is because the mapping $\\Psi_N:R^N\\to R^N$ is permutation-invariant, meaning that while extending it to high dimension will preserve permutation invariance across each channel, these permutations are not going to be necessarily the same, referred to as alignment. This means that while we can ensure that while the naive approach ensures that each channel is preserved with permutation invariance, these permutations are not necessarily the same, and thus the vectors structure, where indices of vector do matter, may be lost. \n\n*Linearly lifting dimension to $L$ to resolve alignment* The main idea behind the proposed theory, as far as I can understand, is how to prevent this *alignment problem* by linearly lifting the $D$-dimensional elements to a much higher dimension $L$ that has lots of redundancies. Crucially, this lifting has the property channels of two different matrices after lifting can be aligned independently, then one matrix is a row-permutation of another.\n\nHere I will summarise the more detailed theoretical insights I can draw from various parts of the paper \n- *Anchor.* The main idea for the entire theoretical construction in fact develops on top of this alignment problem, suggesting a way to \"anchor\" different channels. The theoretical construct. Formally, anchor $a\\in R^N$ for data $X \\in R^{N\\times D}$, preserves the equality structure of the rows of $X$: $x^{(i)}\\neq x^{(j)}\\implies a_i\\neq a_j$.  \n- *Coupling of alignment with anchor.* If $a$ is an anchor of $X$, and $a'$ is a permutation of $a,$ and same permutation $P$ can be applied on every channel of $X$ to transform to the equivalent channel of $X'$, then rows of $X$ are a permutation of rows of $X'$. Thus, we can couple the alignment of various channels to the alignment of $a$ to $a',$ we can easily conclude that $X\\sim X'$ \n-  *Linear probes for anchors. * We can pick linear probes $w_1,\\dots, w_k\\in R^D,$ such that for any matrix $X,$ at least one of the $X w_1,\\dots, X w_k$ must be an anchor of $X$. This is achieved by picking a large enough $K$, and $w_k$'s such that every subset of size $D$ will be linearly independent, i.e., in general position, which is achievable by simply drawing from some Gaussian multivariate distribution. The claim follows from a cute pigeonhole principle. Now, if we do set representation of all $x^{(i)}$ and these linear probes $X w_k$'s, we can ensure that each of them are injective, and at least one of the $X w_k$'s is an anchor, but we still haven't coupled the alignment of the anchor to the rest of the channels. \n- *Coupling channel alignments to the anchor* Next, authors prove existence of coefficients $\\gamma_1,\\dots, \\gamma_K$ such that if$x\\sim x', y\\sim y'$ and  $x - \\gamma_k y$ is a permutation of $x' - \\gamma_k y'$ for every $k = 1, \\dots, K$, then permutation of $x\\sim x'$ and $y\\sim y'$ can be aligned. \n- *Lifting* Here, using the linear probes $w_k$ and coefficients $\\gamma_k$'s from previous step, we can define lifting operator colums  $w_{i,j,k} = e_i - \\gamma_k w_j$  for a polynomial range of $i,j,k$, and put all of them as columns of the lifting linear $W \\in R^{D\\times L}.$ Then each channel (column) of $Y = X W$ will be of the form $x^{(i)} - \\gamma_k X w_j.$ Therefore, by previous properties, if every channel (column) of $X W$ can be aligned to (is a permutation of) $X' W$, then rows of $X$ are a permutation of $X'.$ The *set representation* of each channel will follow naturally from this step."

                "value": "Main issues: \n- While the paper presents a mathematically intriguing case, I am not quite sure what to draw from it from a machine learning perspective.  While theoretical contributions should certainly be welcome in the ML field, I think the theoretical works should take a few steps in demonstrating the relevance of their results for the broader community. For example, are there any concrete examples or use cases that these theoretical findings would be relevant? \n- Following up on the previous point, despite the embedding-sum decomposition, the construction of the $\\rho$ function $\\rho:R^L \\to R$ is still a complete black box. Again, these non-constructive arguments do not seem to add up to any \"practical insight.\" While this is not a 100\\% a critical point, if authors can think of ways to make it easier for the reader to imagine applications, they would broaden their audience and enhance the impact of the paper.  \n- While the paper is mathematically sound, it could benefit from more high-level idea developments both before and after the theorems. There are several places where a geometric interpretation is available, but not discussed in the main text. For example in the proof of Lemma 4.2 it becomes clear that a system of $w_k$'s in general position, if there are \"enough\" of them, at least one will be one that is not in the hyperplane orthogonal to difference between each two columns of $X$, perhaps this can even be visualised for some toy example with $D=2$ and $N=3.$ With the intuition that authors have built upon this case, if they are able to come up with more intuitive/visual depiction of these concepts, it would dramatically improve the paper's readability and accessibility.\n\n Minor issues:\n- The notion of injectivity for functions (Def 2.7), that $f(X) = f(X')$ implies rows of $X$ are a permutation of rows of $X$', slightly deviates from the standard notion that assumes \"a function f that maps distinct elements of its domain to distinct elements.\" It took me quite a few iterations to notice this slight difference. Perhaps author can caution the reader before or afterwards. Most readers will be inclined to assume the \"default\" notion which could lead to some confusions later on. \n- The notation $[a\\ x]\\sim [a'\\ x']$ which (for example used in Lemma 4.2) is somewhat ambiguous. Initially, I interpreted it as concatenating the two vectors along their main axis $[a\\ x] \\in R^{2N}$ which leads to lots of contradictions, while the authors implied stacking them along a new dimension $[a\\ x]\\in R^{2\\times N}$ which makes sense. While this might be consistent with the papers notation elsewhere, it is still good and helpful to highlight it for the readers that this implies stacking them and not concatenation.  \n- \"Comparison with Prior Arts\"? I'm guessing authors mean \"articles\" here? Is this a common shorthand for articles? While I don't want to sound authoritative, this seems like a rather informal writing style.\n- (page 17) \"pigeon-hold principle\" I'm guessing authors refer to \"pigeonhole principle\" :)"

                "value": "- The main results of this paper are obtained for a notion of permutation-invariance of $f,$ which is somewhat strictly defined over the entire input set $X.$ In real world applications, often the feature vectors $x$ represent learned or encoded features of a particular dataset. So in these cases, the \"user\" will be interested in \"relaxed set preserving properties\", in the sense that permutation invariance is only held over a subset (possibly even countable subset) of $R^{N\\times D}$. Can authors think of any interesting relaxations  on $X$ and extend their theory for those? (assuming it has certain properties or its feature vectors are chosen from a smaller/finite set)\n- Upon reading the paper, the architecture that authors propose resembles a network with depth \"2\" (perhaps this mysteriously encoded $\\rho$ , which in reality could be a highly complex $R^L\\to R$ function). In certain scenarios, there could be a hierarchical set representations, e.g., we want to embed sets of sets of sets, (or even more). Can authors comment on extendability of their theory, or in general any comments they may have for such multilevel/hierarchical sets?"
