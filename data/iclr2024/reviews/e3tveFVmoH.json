Two main practical methods, progressive \\gama-cliplling and Automatic learning rate, are introduced to increase the convergence rate which is also justified by the later experiments. It is not theoretically clear why AS2P has a better convergence rate than S2P. Does it mean these two methods are derived from the based on the previous theorem? \n2. The imperial results show that the proposed algorithm especially AS2P has a better convergence rate compared with other zero-order algorithms, still first-order optimisers are commonly used in the practice, Do the authors base line for that? \n3. From theorem 3.1 and theorem 3.2, four options are provided for setting \\alpha_k iteratively. So what are the differences in practice? Is AS2P a special case of Option 4? \n4. In all the experiments, AS2P outperforms GA and STP in terms of both the convergence speed and training and evaluation loss. Does the author give a fair hyperparameter tuning to all the competitors? And how the others are tuned? In the proposed theorem, there is no clear theoretical guarantee showing the convergence rate f(x)-f*(x) is improved in the paper can the author give more explanation? \n5. When the zero-order optimiser is needed for LLM training? Without using gradient information how worse the trained model will be compared with that trained gradient-based optimiser such as AdamW? \n\nTypo: In the last paragraph on Page 8.

                "value": "**Weakness**\n\n1. This paper basically follows the paper of three point method. The key difference is that this paper ignores the current weight when solving the argmin in optimization. But in the STP method, it is crucial that the current weight gives guarantee on the monotonicity of optimization. Without such guarantee, it seems quite not likely that the method could reach a suboptimal condition, i.e. $min ||g|| \\leq \\epsilon$. Given that the current weight is ignored in the proposed two point method, how the authors ensure the minimization is non-increasing? I have not found any discussions in regards to the failure cases.\n\n    I notice that the Theorem 3.1 presents a similar conclusion in regards to that in STP. The theorem actually implies that the method could reach at suboptimal under certain condition. But to my understanding, the convergence properties could be worse than the STP method, where the proposed method is proved to converge over estimation. Could the authors give detailed comparisons between the proposed method and STP, given that the two methods are quite similar.\n\n2. I am wondering could the authors provide some evidence other than the results that the proposed method could give better approximation compared to other similar methods? That would be more substantial to support the superiority of your methods. For example, the authors could measure the distance between the optimal model and the model trained with the proposed method. \n\n3. Regarding the experiments, firstly the authors may need to compare some other advanced similar methods, like the MEZO (Sadhika Malladi) cited by the authors. Secondly, the evaluation performance is missing regarding training on the Cifar datasets. Thirdly, I think the authors may need to add results of using bp gradient to give reference. Fourthly, the figures are quite not friendly to read, to present clear comparison, the authors may provide tables in addition. Finally, it is highly recommended that the authors can release their code for reproductivity."
