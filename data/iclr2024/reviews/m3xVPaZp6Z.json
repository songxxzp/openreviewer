Borrowing the idea of rehearsal from the cognitive mechanism, this work proposes policy rehearsal. In detail, this work hopes to train an array of models to imitate the target model. Theoretical analyses indicate that the target environment performance gap between the policy trained in these imitated models and the optimal policy can be bounded by three terms, which are further summarized as diversity and eligibility. Based on these two criteria, this work proposes two corresponding reward functions for training imitated models and then uses these models to train the policy. Also, the proposed ReDM can easily combined with offline datasets. Extensive results show the effectiveness of ReDM."

As the dynamic of the target environment will vary a lot, whether finetuning the agent (as well as the model) in the target environment with few steps will be more reasonable?\n\n- About $r_e$ for Eligibility. The proposed method is to randomly sample N trajectories and estimate the biggest return. Is this inefficient as the state space and action space are continuous in experiments?

Concretely, the proposed method, *ReDM*, takes as input a reward function and a termination function and generates a set of transition functions or models. Imaginary trajectories can thus be generated by rolling out these transition models and used to warm up the policy. As some of the models may produce data close to the target environment dynamics, the policy warmed up with these data can have a good initialization when deployed to the target environment, which is helpful for subsequent fine-tuning. Additionally, the method can be modified for offline-RL settings, allowing it to learn a robust and generalizable policy even with a small amount of offline data mismatched with target environment dynamics. \n\nThe method is motivated theoretically and contains lots of analysis like performance bound, laying foundations for future study in this new direction. Besides, the experiments on the standard gym and D4RL environment empirically prove the effectiveness of the method for both online and offline policy learning."

The idea is to generate a set of candidate dynamics models and learn an adaptive policy that optimizes the original reward on this candidate set. If the true dynamics are in the distribution of the candidate set, the adaptive policy should perform well on the true task. The central problem lies in generating a candidate set of dynamics models. The authors propose optimizing over dynamics models with RL using a reward that incentivizes (1) diversity among the set and (2) the tendency for random trajectories to achieve high reward. The method alternates between optimizing for a new dynamics model to add to the set and optimizing for a new adaptive policy given the current set. When interaction data from the true task is available, it is used to regularize the optimization over dynamics models. Experiments show the method can work with no interaction data on low-dimensional continuous control tasks (inverted pendulum, mountain car, acrobot). On two D4RL tasks (hopper, half-cheetah) with a small amount of random interaction data, the method outperforms prior offline model-free and model-based RL methods."

                "value": "My main concern is the limited applicability of this method beyond low-dimensional benchmark tasks due to some significant assumptions. The method assumes access to a query-able reward/termination function and the initial state distribution. Though more importantly, the method assumes that the dynamics can be easily parameterized and optimized over with RL. Additionally, the method assumes that random plans through the candidate dynamics models will achieve some non-zero reward (to optimize the dynamics models for the eligibility reward). These assumptions makes the method difficult to apply (if not impossible) in sparse-reward or high-dimensional (e.g image-based) environments. In principle these issues could be solved by providing the method with enough interaction data to learn a good dynamics model initialization. However, then prior offline model-based or model-free methods might also work well. Additionally, this still wouldn't make the method applicable to sparse reward problems. \n\nAnother concern is the limited scope of the experiments relative to prior work. The evaluations on InvertedPendulum, MountainCar, and Acrobot are good for analyzing the method, however for the comparison to prior work, experiments are only shown for HalfCheetah and Hopper. It would be good to additionally include at least Walker2d. Additionally, the experiments with interaction data only test random interaction data and relatively small amounts of data (200 and 5000 transitions). While it is understandable that this is the setting where the proposed method would excel, it would be good to also show comparison to prior work with interaction data of varying optimality and amounts (including the full D4RL datsets). \n\nThere is no discussion of MAPLE in the related work section. MAPLE is very related (just a different model generation process) so the similarities and differences should be addressed here. It would also be good to include a brief mention of meta-learning in the related work as the proposed method uses similar concepts when optimizing for the adaptive policy.\n\nSmaller comments:\n- Algorithm 1 does not say a lot about the method. It could be replaced by algorithms 5/6 from the appendix. \n- Figure 1 should use a more descriptive x-axis label like \"Tasks\".\n- Figure 3 needs a more descriptive caption that explains what \"model loss\" means here.\n- The locations of Figure 2 and 3 should be switched."

Meanwhile, current reinforcement learning methods commonly rely on numerous environment interactions but hardly obtain generalizable policies. In this paper, the authors introduce the idea of *rehearsal* into policy optimization, where the agent plans for all possible outcomes in mind and acts adaptively according to actual responses from the environment. To effectively rehearse, they propose ReDM, an algorithm that generates a diverse and eligible set of dynamics models and then rehearse the policy via adaptive training on the generated model set. Rehearsal enables the policy to make decision plans for various hypothetical dynamics and to natually generalize to previously unseen environments. Their experimental results demonstrate that ReDM is capable of learning a valid policy solely through rehearsal, even with zero interaction data. Besides, they further extend ReDM to scenarios where limited or mismatched interaction data is available. The provided empirical results reveal that ReDM produces high-performing policies compared with other offline RL baselines."

                "value": "1. I am curious if totally no interaction data, how can the generated dynamics model approximates the real dynamics in the target environment. It seems there lacks enough grounding points to support this potential. Does there exist the probability that the generated dynamics models are far from the dynamics in the target environment? I hope to see more analysis on this during the rebuttal.\n2. The D4RL benchmark in your experiments is all Mujoco tasks with low input dimensions. Could you please consider incorporating some more high-dimensional task, in which the hypothesis space is too large to narrow down?\n3. In the paper, you claim that the interaction data is only used to narrow down the hypothesis space. But could you please consider how to utilize these interaction data in a more direct way to better facilitate the policy learning as the complement to the purely dynamics model learning, like finetuning the learned meta policy? Besides, I cannot agree the statement that the biasedness in the interaction data will somehow hinder the policy optimization in traditional offline RL methods. If such pre-collected trajectories are expert ones or near-optimal ones, such *biasedness* can actually help avoid some low-value and dangerous states.\n4. Considering your method encourages the diversity in the model learning part, some learned dynamics models may be unreasonable though the meta policy can still achieve high returns via planning in such models, like violating the physics laws or economics laws. And I can hardly expect the *eligibility* part in your method can help alleviate this 'short-path' issue. More explanations and discussions are encouaged during the rebuttal phase."
