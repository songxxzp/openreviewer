RADAGENT explores in a tree stucture similar to Tree-of-Thought and learns a utility of solutions based on ELO scores over different outcomes. The ELO score is calculated by LLM-prompted pairwise comparison between solutions, and guides the annealed probability of choosing branches for exploration. The result with the best ELO score is used as the final solution. On sevaral decision-making environments, RADAGENT outperforms ReAct, Tree-of-Thought-based methods and Reflexion."

For example, on some reasoning environments that can be modeled as decision-making ones such as HotPotQA [1], it is very reasonable that the agent does not know whether its answer is correct until it gives the final answer. External feedback would also make tasks such as fact verification [2] and multiple choices [3] trivial, and thus decision-making with no external feedback is important. \n\n2. The proposed solution based on ELO scores and tree-of-thought is simple, intuitive, yet effective on multiple environments.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Z. Yang et al.

                "value": "**1. The presentation of the work is not clear enough.**\n\na) The state, action and decision step in the context is not well-defined. As Large Language Models (LLMs) take text as input and output text, it is unclear what do state and action correspond to in the context. I assume the authors develop their method based on ReAct [1] and Tree-of-Thought [2] as illustrated in Figure 1, but they are not properly introduced in the methodology part. In addition, I would recommend the authors to emphasize that the reward is not given in Markov Decision Process (MDP) of this paper, which is uncommon. \n\nb) The \"subsequent step\" in Sec. 3.1 is unclear. In preliminary section, decision steps have a subscript that stands for the number of steps, and \"subsequent step\" can be comprehended as a chain of steps following the current step. but in Sec. 3.1, the subsequent step with different subscript should be different versions of next step. Also, I would suggest to introduce $n$, change $\\hat{d}$ to $d_{n+1}$ (because $\\hat{d}$ has no subscript), and change $\\sum_j$ to $\\sum_{j=1}^{n+1}$. \n\n**2. Prompts for each environment is not specified.** Only the prompt for utility learning is listed; the prompt for each environment is missing in the appendix. \n\n**3. The authors could perform more ablations on the exploration process.** The exploration process is controlled by multiple factors, such as temperature $\\tau$, initial ELO score $\\hat{v}$ and ELO coefficient $r$, and because the probability of exploring a new decision is exponential to the initial ELO score, it is intuitive that RADAGENT might fall into local minima where the currently best solution presents in the branch but can still be improved. Thus, it would be better if an ablation study on the hyperparameter could be performed to better measure the robustness of RADAGENT. \n\n**References**\n\n[1] S. Yao et al.

During experience exploration, the agent samples the next decision step from a Boltzmann distribution, which is determined by their Elo scores. To learn the Elo score function, the method employs pairwise comparison and subsequent score update. It starts by recalibrating the Elo scores of the final decision steps in each sequence based on pairwise comparison, then updates the Elo scores of preceding steps using the scores of their subsequent decision steps. Various experimental tasks validate RaDAgent's superiority over its competitors."

However, such methods rely on the Reward function being available and the agent being capable of perceiving rewards at each step. \n\nThe authors propose RADAGENT, an agent that can utilize RL-type sequential decision-making methods in the absence of a reward function. In order to do so, the authors devise a customized reward function (reward shaping) that is based on the Elo rating system. Each episode (decision sequence) assigns a reward following three-valued logic (1, 0 or 0.5) depending on the outcome. These are propagated upward in a bottom-up fashion enabling the agent to eventually self-evaluate earlier steps in the decision making process. The exploration process is similar to methods like $\\epsilon$-greedy but now conditioned as a softmax over elo scores.\n\nThe authors then provide an empirical evaluation on a few datasets and showcase that their approach is able to outperform baseline methods."

IE how is a \"win\" determined? I assume it is binary (task completed or not). In this case, are two decision sequences where both are \"wins\" but one is longer than the other compared? (Longer ones require more API calls I assume).\n\n2. Building upon #2 above, the paper claims that there is a performance measure absent. That would mean that there is no real way of determining the final utility or \"win\". I think that there is some human-expert knowledge that is required for RADAGENT to be able to function.

It seems like RaDAgent has the highest or tied for highest incidence ratio for both Hallucinated Tool and Tool Call Error. If I understand the meaning of incidence ratio correctly, high values are undesirable. Yet the text does not really provide any discussion of these results, so I am left a bit confused as to what to make of them. Is this because the other methods fail for other reasons? What do these numbers really tell us?\n\n### Structure of Paper\n\nI think related work would be better placed earlier in the paper (prior to experiments). It would help the reader better contextualize the both RaDAgent and the baselines.\n\nI also find the structure of the experiments is a bit rambly. Having section an experimental settings section and RQ1-5 is fine, but then having an additional discussion section after 5 previous subsections that are already discussing results feels kind of disorganized, especially since there is some overlap. In particular, each section of the discussion contrasts RaDAgent against existing methods, which according to the description of RQ5 (What are the key differentiating factors of RADAGENT against other methods?), is supposed to be within its purview."
