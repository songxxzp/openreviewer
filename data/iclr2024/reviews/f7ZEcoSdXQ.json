In introduction,\n    > We are the first to prove that Wasserstein distance is an essential factor in the convergence bound of FL with heterogeneous data (Lemma 4.2)\n\n    If my understanding is correct, the Wasserstein distance is used to derive a specific instantiation of an existing result, which already provides a way to formalize the heterogenity of data in FL. It is unclear why Wasserstein distance is essential.\n\n5. Is the Wasserstein distance formally recalled somewhere? Is the definition of $\\delta_k$ the formal definition? If so, does it mean that it does not work for regression problems?\n\n6. In the definition of $\\delta_k$, what is the support of $p^{(k)}, p^{(c)}$?\n\n7. After the definition of $\\delta_k$,\n    > p(c) indicates the reference (iid) data distribution in the centralized setting\n\n    Why is there a centralized setting, and what is meant by iid data distribution? Furthermore, how to obtain $\\delta_k$ in implementation?\n\n8. In Section 3.2,\n    > Learner: seeking to train a classifier that endeavors to encourage agents to decrease the degree of non-iid. Thereby, attaining faster convergence at a reduced cost.\n\n    What is meant by \"decreasing the degree of non-iid\"? Furthermore, precisely what is the cost in the \"at a reduced cost\"?\n\n9. What are $ g_t, \\bar{g}_t, f^* $ in Lemma 4.1?\n\n10. In Lemma 4.2, what is the $L_{x|y=i}$-Lipschitz function Lipschitz w.r.t.~?\n\n\n11. The learner is assumed to have access to $\\mathcal{D}_c$, what are its properties and how can this assumption be satisfied?\n\n12. What exactly is $\\text{Bound}(e)$?\n\n13. What is the \"Ninety-ninety rule\"?\n\n14. In Theorem 5.1, the partial derivative of $f$ is taken. Does it mean you require the assumption that function $f$ is differentiable? If so, what are the (practical) motivations for this assumption?\n\n15. In Definition 5.1, how are the constants $d_k^1, d_k^2$ set or determined, and how are $d_k^1, d_k^2$ related for a fixed $k$?\n\n\n16. Why (only) Nash equilibrium in a Stackelberg game? Can something be said about the behavior of the learner (i.e., leader in the Stackelberg game) to consider the Stackelberg equilibrium?\n\n17.

Under this condition, they propose using a payment function based on a client's performance relative to its peers.

The important part is in Figure 4 which shows the implicit cost-reward tradeoff from varying the client's iid-ness.\n\nThe FL setup itself is also limited in that it resamples data from the same shared pool. While this toy setup might provide the clearest results it is also quite unrealistic.
