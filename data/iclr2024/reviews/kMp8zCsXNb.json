                "value": "This paper proposes ASMR, a new architecture for implicit neural network (INR) representation. The main selling point is the very low inference cost. ASMR encodes a signal by creating a hierarchical partitioning of the input domain and associating to each partition level (except the first) one transformation layer and one modulation layer.  More precisely, each input dimension of size $N$ is partitioned in $L$ levels such that each level $x_i$ is of a given size $B_i$ and the product of all level sizes correspond to the size of the original dimension.  Every level $i$ of the model takes as input coordinate of that level ($x_i$), transforms it through a neural layer (the \"modulator\"), upscales both a linear transformation of the output of the previous layer and the output of the modulator, sums them and applies a non-linear function. This leads to reduced computation at inference: at a given layer $i\\in\\{1,...,L\\}$ of the model, the number of computed values is multiplied by $B_i$ (for each dimension). In other words, the number of computed values increases from $B_0$ to $N$ with the depth of the model and values computed in the earliest layers are reused gracefully for many coordinates.\n\nThe paper then provides a proof that this architecture leads to an inference cost that is upper bounded by a value that does not depend on the depth of the network. Finally, experiments measures the inference cost and the reconstruction quality on images (Pluto and Kodak) and one video. Meta-learning and the impact of various strategy for the hierarchical decomposition are also evaluated and discussion in two distinct experiments. Between 2 and 5 baselines are considered in most experiments."

As Instant-NGP is known for its fast inference, I think it is not possible to know whether ASMR is really better than grid-based approaches.\n- In Figure 2, left, kiloNERF always has a higher MAC count than ASMR. In Figure 2, right, kiloNERF often has a lower MAC than ASMR. From the text, I assumed these were the same trained models. This looks inconsistent to me.\n- In Section 3.3, the paper states that the per-sample inference cost depends only on the width of the model and is independent of the depth. I am no sure I agree with that statement, as the depth depends on the choice of the basis and thus on the width of the layers. For example, as far as I understand, doubling the size of the basis also means halving the number of layers.\n\nclarity:\n- The paper did not look polished in some places to me. For example, I am under the impression that multiple notations are used to refer to the same or very similar things, which was confusing to me. Here are a few examples:\n   - a base is denoted by $|x_i$ in Figure 1 and $B_i$ in Section 3.1 (where Figure 1 is referenced)\n   - the cumulative product of bases is denoted by $|x_{i...0}|$ in Figure 1 and by $C_i$ in Section 3.1.\n\nsignificance:\n- For the video experiment, a single video is used. I find that a bit underwhelming as recent papers have typically used video benchmarks for evaluation."

To be specific, these multi-resolution coordinates are shares the activation and use up-sampling to save the activation storage.

Use upsampling (bilinear, nearest, etc) to reduce the number of forward passes by sharing the activations.\n- [1] also uses modulation as well.\n- Due to the existence of [1], I think the paper should change the overall claim, e.g., the first INR to decouple MAC from its depth or using shared activations.\n- Also, the comparison with Multi-scale INR [1] is definitely needed.\n\n**Missing related works: INR modulation.**\n- There exist more recent modulation techniques in the field compared to bias modulation [3,4]. It would also be interesting if ASMR uses more advanced modulations, e.g., low-rank modulation for SIREN [3].\n- missing a reference [9], which is the same method as COIN++ but used for other downstream tasks (e.g., generation, classification).\n\n**The method is somewhat non-trivial to use for 3D scene rendering**\n- Note that 3D is one of the most famous applications of INR.\n- For 3D INRs, there is some paper that tackles a similar issue [5].\n\n**The experiment section should be improved**\\\n(i) Recently, there have been several papers that tackle modality-specific INRs. The authors should claim the benefit of using ASMR compared to modality-specific ones.\n- First, the authors should show multiple modalities rather than images. (Note that video only shows one example). Considering Audio or Manifold [8]\n- Second, the authors need to discuss the benefit of using ASMR over modality-specific INRs. For instance, there are several video INR papers [6,7] showing efficiency.\n- Finally, I think ASMR is hard to use for 3D scenes, so it has less benefit compared to SIREN or FFN.\n\n(ii) Only used one video sample for evaluation. \n- Rather than reporting one sample, it is better to consider a dataset.\n\n(iii) It is hard to understand the intention of Section 5.2 (as it is somewhat trivial). \n- I think the authors are trying to point out that. \n- (a) \u2018ASMR uses modulation, but there is no specific modulation technique for multi-grid based INRs\u2019\n- (b) \u2018meta-learning modulation is important when using INRs for downstream tasks due to the dimensional efficiency.\u2019 [8,9]\n- I think this claim is not new to the community, and the modulation technique that ASMR is using is from [8,9].\n\n(iv) Comparison with grid-based baselines are missing, e.g., Instant-NGP [10]. \n- Instant-NGP shows image, high-resolution image, and video experiments. \n- It is very worth comparing the efficiency as these methods are proposed for efficiency.\n\n**Summary**\\\nOverall, I quite like the method, but there are several things to be improved, e.g., the major claim should be changed due to the missing important baseline, and comparing with grid-based INRs like instant-NGP [10] and Multi-scale INR [1]. I kindly request the authors to rewrite certain parts and compare ASMR with the baseline in detail throughout the rebuttal.\n\n**Reference**\\\n[1] Adversarial Generation of Continuous Images, CVPR 2021\\\n[2] Generating Videos with Dynamics-aware Implicit Generative Adversarial Networks, ICLR 2022\\\n[3] Modality-Agnostic Variational Compression of Implicit Neural Representations, ICML 2023\\\n[4] Versatile Neural Processes for Learning Implicit Neural Representations, ICLR 2023\\\n[5] Mip-NeRF: A Multiscale Representation for Anti-Aliasing Neural Radiance Fields, ICCV 2021\\\n[6] NeRV: Neural Representations for Videos, NeurIPS 2021\\\n[7] Scalable Neural Video Representations with Learnable Positional Features, NeurIPS 2022\\\n[8] COIN++: Neural Compression Across Modalities, TMLR 2022\\\n[9] From data to functa: Your data point is a function and you can treat it like one, ICML 2022\\\n[10] Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding, SIGGRAPH 2022"
