The grid world benchmark, while valuable for assessing agent generalization capabilities, may be considered relatively straightforward and may not fully address the complexities exhibited by current deep learning systems with intricate behaviors. Moreover, its discrete nature may not adequately mirror the continuous nature of many real-world generalization challenges.\nWhile the paper attempts to evaluate against neural network-based approaches, it predominantly relies on relatively simplistic methods, with the best-performing one being the CNN. I recommend the authors expand the range of neural network baselines for a more comprehensive comparison with the proposed approach.

QORA distinguishes itself by utilizing an object-oriented framework capable of forming models from a domain-agnostic, object-based state representation. This approach allows it to effectively handle environments with stochastic transitions.\n\nKey contributions of the paper include:\n\n1. Algorithmic Development: The introduction of QORA, which can efficiently construct expressive models that are demonstrated to solve a diverse array of domains.\n2. Generalization Capability: QORA's design enables it to achieve perfect predictive accuracy in the authors' test domains, far surpassing the baseline neural network model in terms of the number of observations needed by nearly four orders of magnitude.\n3. Zero-Shot Transfer: The algorithm's capacity for zero-shot transfer is particularly noteworthy, as it can adapt to environments that have been modified without the necessity for retraining.\n4. Adaptability: The adaptability of QORA is further evidenced by its rapid learning curve when faced with tasks that include interactions with new objects not present in the training set.\n5. Interpretability of Results: QORA's ability to generate easily interpretable rules is a significant step towards bridging the gap between performance and understandability in machine learning models.\n6. Benchmark Suite: The authors also contribute a novel benchmark suite tailored to assess the generalization capabilities of learning algorithms, which is a valuable asset for future research in the field.\n\nOverall, QORA represents an advancement in the pursuit of generalizable reinforcement learning algorithms, with a clear emphasis on efficiency, transferability, and interpretability."

In experiments on three environments, QORA achieves zero error with orders of magnitude fewer observations than neural networks. It demonstrates strong generalization via zero-shot transfer and rapid adaptation to new object types and interactions. The learned conditional probability rules are compact and interpretable.
