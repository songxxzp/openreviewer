                "value": "This paper proposes a simple metric for measuring alignment between the generated sample and the condition for conditional diffusion models (such as text-to-image or text-to-audio models). The authors propose to leverage the conditional likelihood of the model which can be computed through the diffusion process, and name this CAS \u2014 condition alignment score. They also propose a method to improve the DDIM inversion that is required to compute the likelihood, and suggest a simple approximation to speed up this computation. CAS is measured for several domains, and found to align well with objective metrics like CLIP score or subjective human evaluations."

                "value": "1. The problem of defining a universal metric for condition alignment is important but under-researched. Using the likelihood computed from the model itself is a clever choice, and is analogous to intrinsic measures like perplexity in language models.\n\n2. The paper is well written and easy to understand, and the motivation for using the metric is explained clearly. The contributions for improving and speeding up DDIM inversion are also described well.\n\n3. Evaluations are conducted across several domains including image and audio, and CAS shows strong correlation with previously used measures like CLIP score. This is useful for researchers using diffusion models in other domains.\n\n4. Most importantly, the authors have mentioned that the code for computing CAS will be made publicly available. This should make it easy to use as a metric for future work on conditional diffusion models."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. In Section 2 (paragraph 2), the authors mention that CAS score relies on computing the likelihood of samples generated from a conditional diffusion model, for which they use a method proposed previously by Song et al. This was later used by Zimmermann et al. to measure the class-conditional likelihood of images. The key difference, as described in Section 4.1, is that the authors subtract the unconditional likelihood. While the authors provide some empirical justification for this (Figure 2), it may be useful to conduct a more thorough investigation to justify the hypotheses proposed in Section 4.1, for example by training conditional diffusion models on some toy data.\n\n2. In Section 4.4, the approximation only holds when $\\sigma$ approaches 0. Based on this, we should expect the accuracy for the approximation to improve as we choose $\\sigma$ closer to 0, but this is not true in Table 1. Do the authors have some explanation for this behavior? Further, given the large range of NRMSE values, how should practitioners choose this parameter when computing CAS for a new domain?\n\n3. In Section 5.2, the authors only use a single metric (accuracy) to measure the correspondence between CAS and human preference. However, this does not give any insights on how well CAS difference correlates with human judgment. It may be more useful to show a plot with CAS difference between the samples and the corresponding human preference accuracy (for e.g., through a histogram), where we expect the accuracy to increase as the CAS difference gets larger."

I personally like EER. EER can be nicely computed for example with (https://github.com/bsxfan/PYLLR). Interestingly, same package also allows to plot DET plot that shows the whole ROC in a bit more meaningful way. \n- I think it i would be especially useful to have the complete derivations of the main result in the appendix. \n- Eq. (9)  also needs a bit more explanation that could be written in the Appendix. \n\n- Some notatioanl issues, such as vectors are marked with bold symbol and non-bold symbol. \n- What is the intuition that in Fig 2, - log p(x) shows better performance than log p(x)? \n- How was ground truth estimated from Van Gogh dataset?

For example, consider adding a detailed description for the piepline of the method in Figure 3. Explain the full name and formula of NRMSE in Table 1.\n  - More ranking examples can be shown in Appendix. \n- The experiments can be improved in those aspects:\n  - Report the standard deviation for experiments. Each prompt used in Van Gogh Dataset can be used to generated more groups of test samples to test the baselines. \n  - The numbers of test samples in different experiments are small. As the accuracy reported in Table 3 is near to 50%, it's hard to judge whether this method works well.\n  - The ablation on $\\lambda$ for the ranking metric of CAS is missing. \n- It will be insightful to show some failure cases and analyze the failure mode to help understand the limitations of CAS.\n- There are some typos, for example, the caption for Table 1 is ended without any punctuation.\n\nThis paper can be greatly improved after a careful revision.
