Also, the random labeling approach for estimating saliency would also be suboptimal, because many tokens like articles and prepositions might be used in harmful as well as harmless sentences.\n- Experiments with zero-shot classification (CLIP) would have also been preferable wrt pure classification\n- There are many methods for weight saliency estimation, it would have been nice if the authors had ablated this component using different estimation methods.
