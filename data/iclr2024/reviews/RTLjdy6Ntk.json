            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I see the following four weaknesses, ordered descendingly by importance:\n\nFirst, the paper does not provide convincing evidence that the proposed FL-GNN architecture has consistent, measurable advantages over existing GNN architectures.\nThe experimental results show that FL-GNNs are on-par with previously proposed approaches.\nWhile the authors allude to potential insights into graph inference and improved model interpretability in the conclusion, the anecdotal evidence provided in appendix C is, by itself, not sufficient to claim that FL-GNNs provide interpretable predictions.\nHere, a more comprehensive evaluation and a comparison with general gradient-based approaches, such as [GradCAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391), or graph-specific approaches, such as [GnnExplainer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03894) would have been interesting.\nAs it stands, the relevance of the proposed architecture is unclear to me.\n\nSecond, the definition of the FL-GNN architecture in section 3 is, in parts, lacking formal accuracy. Here are a few examples:\n- Section 3.1: The signatures of $\\phi$ and $\\psi$, as well as those of $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ are unclear. The authors state that the signature of $\\phi$ is $V \\to F_v$ but also that $\\phi(v_i) \\subset F_v$. Similarly, supposedly $\\rho(\\phi(v_i)) \\subset A_v$, even though the target domain of $\\rho$ is $A_v$, not $2^{A_v}$.\n- Section 3.2, eq. 10: Why is the \"AND\" in the condition taken over all $A_m \\in \\{ A_{m_{1,i}},\\dots, A_{m_{D,j}} \\}$? Since $i$ is used to denote the feature index and $j$ to denote the index of a fuzzy  subset, $A_{m_{1,j}}$ was probably meant here. Is this correct?\n- Section 3.2: $S$ is defined as the Cartesian product of $D$ sets of size $M$, therefore $|S| = M^D$; in the last line on page 4 the authors do however state that $S$ has $M^D$ subsets.\nEven though each of those examples can be considered to be minor formal mistakes, the repeated unclear usage of \"element\" and \"subset\" of a set make it difficult to understand the precise meaning of the provided formal definitions.\n\nThird, the proposed approach only considers the direct neighbors of a vertex in each rule. Indirect interactions between vertices therefore are not captured by FL-GNNs, as also alluded to by the authors at the end of appendix C.\nThe authors do not discuss if and how meaningful interpretations could be provided in problem domains where such indirect interactions are important.\n\nLast, I noticed a number of minor typos, that could have easily been prevented by proofreading. A few examples: Consistently used \"Coar\" instead of \"Cora\" in section 4, \"fields such as medical image process\" (page 1), \"information are ubiquitous\" (page 2)."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Is there additional evidence supporting the claim that FL-GNNs can provide meaningful interpretations? Is the quality of those interpretations/explanations better than that of other XAI approaches?\n2. Concerning the formal definitions, can you clarify the intended meaning of the mentioned formulas?\n3. Can FL-GNNs be adapted to also capture indirect vertex interactions and, if so, how?"
