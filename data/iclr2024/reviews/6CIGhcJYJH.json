Although the proposed restricted Schur complement $S_{res}$ allows the Hessian $\\nabla^2_{yy} f$ to be degenerate, the obtained necessary condition still requires some other assumptions on $h(\\delta)$, and characterizing the limit points of extragradient through $S_{res}$ also requires other conditions like $s_0$, $\\eta^*$, $\\sigma_j$ or $\\iota_j$. These conditions, including $S_{res}$, could be computationally more heavy and cumbersome to check. Some high-level intuition about how $S_{res}$ is designed and why it is helpful could be good as well.\n\n2. What does the assumption that $S_{res}$ is nondegenerate imply? What assumptions on $H$ are necessary to make sure $S_{res}$ is nondegenerate?\n\n3. I think it would help improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly saying continuous-time GDA/EG or discrete-time GDA/EG to distinguish them. In Example 2, the paper uses both Definition 2(i) and 3 when justifying the behaviors of $xy$. However, 2(i) is for continuous time and 3 is for discrete time. Actually, $\\rho\\\\{\\pm i\\sqrt{\\epsilon}\\\\}\\leq 1$ implies linearly stability if applying Definition 3. Similar confusions between continuous time and discrete time exist elsewhere as well.\n\n4. It would improve the clarity of the paper if some notations were introduced before using them, although the meaning is well-known and can be guessed from the context.  For example, $C^2$ and $DF$ in Assumption 1, $\\lambda_j$ in Lemma 5.1, etc."

The authors introduce the concept of restricted Schur complement to refine the second-order condition and provide a characterization of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the saddle gradient in an asymptotic sense. In particular, the degeneracy leads to pairs of nearly imaginary eigenvalues. To describe these eigenvalues, the authors investigate the curvature information through the *hemicurvature*. Based on this, it is established that the limit points of two-timescale EG in continuous time are local minimax points under mild conditions. Moreover, two-time-scale GDA may avoid non-strict minimax points, while two-timescale EG could find them, which demonstrates the superiority of two-timescale EG over two-timescale GDA."

However, the figures in the appendix are a good illustration and could be put in the main text. \n* (ii) The authors mention that they adopt the hemicurvature instead of the curvature because of the property in Proposition C.4. From the proof, this property is indeed important and the authors should elaborate on this in the main text. \n* (iii) Theorem 6.4 is based on two additional conditions: the distinction of $\\sigma_i$ and $u_j^\\top S u_j \\ge 0 $. The authors should give more explanations on these conditions, e.g., why we need these conditions or what their role is. \n* (iv) In Theorems 6.2 and 6.6, there appear $s^*$ and $\\eta^*$.

For example, what is the relationship between them and $s_0$?\n\nIn summary, I advise the authors to compress the review of previous results and add more interpretation in Sections 5 and 6.

The main claim that two-timescale extragradient finds (nonstrict degenerate) local minimax points (e.g. example 3) is found in Remark 6.8. The argument relies on showing avoidance of non local minimax point coupled with a _global_ convergence guarantee to a fixed point. \n\nThe remark makes it appear as if global convergence for general nonconvex-nonconcave is solved, while Diakonikolas et al., 2021 only applies to the structured problems satisfying the weak Minty variational inequality. Furthermore, the proof provided in the appendix only applies to the Minty variational inequality (MVI).\n\nI suggest toning down the claim and instead state that \"_when_ global convergence can be guaranteed (as e.g. under MVI), Thm. 6.7 implies convergence to (degenerate) local minimax points\".\n\nApart from this one case, the paper is otherwise very transparent about the claim that it makes.\n\nMinor suggestions:\n\n- Some definitions are hard to find (e.g. $H_\\tau$ on page 5). I suggest moving definitions that are needed for the theorem statements to a central place to the extend that it is possible.\n- It is probably worth mentioning [Bauschke et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09827.pdf) work on linear operators regarding the relationship to comonotonicity. \n- It is maybe worth contrasting the timescale separation between players with timescale separation ala [Hsieh et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10162.pdf) (also used for weak MVI)."
