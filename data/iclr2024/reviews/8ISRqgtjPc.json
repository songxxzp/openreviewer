                "value": "The paper presents a novel model named Contrastive Bi-directional Image-Text generation model (CoBIT) aimed at unifying three pre-training objectives, namely, cross-modal contrastive learning, image-to-text generation, and text-to-image generation, under a singular framework. This unification is achieved through a unique unicoder-decoder architecture that houses an image unicoder, a text unicoder, and a cross-modal decoder. The unicoders are capable of toggling between encoding and decoding roles based on the task at hand, thereby promoting shared knowledge which is advantageous for both image-to-text and text-to-image generations. The authors claim that this model architecture allows for superior performance in various tasks like image understanding, image-text understanding, and text-based content creation, with a significant highlight on its effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. The model's efficiency is validated through a series of comprehensive experiments, demonstrating an impressive performance against existing models in the field of Vision-and-Language (VL)."

It could be better if the authors could have more insights on each objective\u2019s advantages from their results.\n2.\tThe advantages of the model over other models are not clear. There is no performance that shows fair comparison with other models. It could be the dataset used for pre-training, batch-size, pretraining epochs, etc. \n3.\tFrom the ablation studies in Table 4, 5 and 6, the gain of proposed joint training of three objectives and shared Transformer (namely unicoder) is rather small and not steady over all tasks.

A more thorough discussion on the computational efficiency and trade-offs of using Unicoder compared to Encoder would provide clearer insights into the practicality of the model.\n\n2. Impact of Pre-training Data: The paper shows good ImageNet linear probe performance for CoBIT in Table 3. It would be interesting to see a more detailed analysis of how the pre-training data impacts the model's performance. This could include experiments with different sizes or types of pre-training datasets.\n\n3. Ablation Study: The ablation study in the paper could be strengthened. \n\n4. From Table 1, it can be observed that the proposed base and large sizes of the model have more parameters compared to other multimodal models. This increase in model complexity might have implications for computational resources and efficiency. The authors should provide more explanation or justification for this design choice, and possibly discuss the trade-off between model complexity and performance."

                "value": "This paper introduces a complex training framework that combines contrastive learning, image-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-image approaches. In addition to the intricate model, they also establish a large-scale database. Through the use of these complex models and extensive data, the trained model performs well on various test tasks."

                "value": "- The primary contribution of this paper lies in the integration of several models and the creation of a database tailored for training such models. Building upon this foundation, they conducted parameter optimization to fine-tune the loss, ultimately yielding favorable results.\n- This paper is easy to read, with coherent writing throughout. The experimental section offers a rich set of comparisons, although there is room for improvement in the analysis and conclusions."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While this paper primarily focuses on pre-training and achieves promising results through additional data collection, it still faces the following issues:\n\n- The most significant concern regarding model design in this paper is the limited novelty of the model's contribution. Each module of the model presented in Fig. 2 is already established, and the authors simply combined and fused their losses for joint training. While the training results appear favorable on the extensive data they collected, the paper's drawback remains the lack of model novelty.\n\n- Data is also a concern here. While it's reasonable to leverage more data, it introduces an element of unfairness because the data for the compared models is not consistent. This makes it challenging to draw valid conclusions, and I believe this aspect may also impact the overall findings.\n\n- The optimization process by the authors appears rather intricate, involving the design of numerous loss functions and hyperparameters. This complexity in model design makes replication challenging because the network and parameters are closely tied to the specific dataset they chose. I believe this is also a weakness of the study.\n\n- In the Model Initialization section, the authors mention using CoCa but do not provide a specific explanation for this choice. They do not clarify why they didn't opt for pre-trained BERT models, sentence transformers, or CLIP-based sentence encoders. It would be beneficial if the authors could offer more insight into the rationale behind their selection of COCA as the initialization method and why they didn't consider other pre-trained models for this purpose.\n\n- In Fig. 2, the fact that ViT-VGGAN is frozen to some extent can be considered a weakness, as the existing CoBIT framework assumes the availability of a well-pretrained ViT-VQGAN. This assumption is partially valid, but if the domain changes, it implies that the entire model would need to be re-pretrained. Moreover, if there's a new VQGAN model, the entire model would also require retraining. I am curious about how the authors address this issue, as this paper primarily focuses on pre-training and should ideally rely on existing model checkpoints as much as possible.\n\n- The results of the Linear Probing experiment show a significant improvement, yet the authors have not provided a more substantial explanation. If Linear Probing is the reason for the 1% improvement in performance, how would fine-tuning more parameters affect the outcome?\n\n- The authors trained image captioning using only cross-entropy loss and overlooked RL-based rewards, which are an important component. The authors should have at least discussed how to integrate RL-based methods into this model because RL-based methods, such as self-critical sequence training (SCST), also impose specific requirements on model design.\n\n- Furthermore, when reporting captioning results, the authors should present them on the MSCOCO online test set, as it provides a fair evaluation benchmark, rather than reporting them on a local set."
