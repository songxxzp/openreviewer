The proposed method is compared with multiple strong baselines on the S-NI dataset consisting of 1616 tasks and the P3 dataset consisting of 62 tasks. The datasets with numerous tasks can better highlight how HART can generate task-specific parameters that are more expressive.\n- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow."

                "value": "This work introduces a variation of the HyperNetwork-based weight generation. In contrast to previous approaches, the proposed method, known as HART, employs layer-wise sequential generation. To enhance the generation process, the authors have applied a local consistency regularization, which serves as a kind of smoothing term to ensure temporal consistency. Additionally, the proposed method incorporates a fusion-in-decoder strategy to operate effectively without the need for HyperPretraining. The authors have demonstrated the strong performance of this method even in scenarios where HyperPretraining is not utilized, specifically for T5-Large and T5-XL.\n\nHowever, I have some concerns as follows:\n\n1)\tThe level of novelty in this work appears limited. The main novelty relies on the adoption of layer-wise autoregressive generation. The local consistency regularizer can be considered a smoothing term or a momentum, and the use of a fusion-in-decoder strategy has been observed in various prior works. To underscore the novelty, it is crucial to conduct more in-depth analyses that concretely demonstrate the advantages of the layer-wise autoregressive model. Figure 3 only illustrates the training loss improvement achieved by the autoregressive model. It would be beneficial to compare the performance of each layer in autoregressive and non-autoregressive models.\n\n2)\tI think that the order of layers is another significant consideration for autoregressive method. While the authors may have utilized layer indices, these indices may not accurately represent the network architecture, particularly in cases involving skip connections or parallel layers. The layer index alone may not capture the sequential operations of the model.\n\n3)\tThe analysis of local consistency could benefit from further exploration. Figures 4 (in the main manuscript) and Figure 5 (in the appendix) offer limited insight into the effects and importance of local consistency. Among them, the t-SNE plot appears to provide some insight, but there is a need for a more detailed explanation of the meaning behind distinct scattering patterns in weight space. A clarification of the physical significance of these patterns is recommended.\n\n4)\tIn the equation for updating the hypernetwork, it is worth considering the inclusion of weighting factors between L_pred and Lcst. In cases where a model has numerous layers or a hypernetwork features high-dimensional hidden states, the update term may have varying impacts. Introducing normalization or weighting factors could help address this issue.\n\n5)\tWhile the proposed method exhibits significant performance improvements over previous works in the case of T5-Large, the gains are somewhat diminished in the case of T5-XL. It is important to note that this is not a critique of the performance itself, as it is understood that the proposed method performs better. However, it would be valuable to investigate the reasons behind this difference in performance. My guess is that T5-XL's increased number of layers may lead to challenges related to the layer-wise autoregressive model, such as forgetting or the layer index issue mentioned earlier. Addressing these potential weaknesses or limitations would be beneficial.\n\nOverall, the proposed work demonstrates superior performance compared to previous works and holds practical utility. However, the main novelty lies in the layer-wise autoregressive model, and there is a need for more comprehensive analyses in this regard. I encourage the authors to provide additional insights during the rebuttal period."

I am not fully convinced by the experiments that the methods are evaluated on the \"unseen\" tasks. In Tables 2 to 5, what is the separation between the training tasks and evaluation tasks? Are the tasks that appeared in training, not in the evaluation tasks? For example, question-answering is only used in training but not in evaluation.
