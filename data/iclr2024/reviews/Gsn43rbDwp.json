From the reviewer's perspective, the idea of mentioning and using the single-qubit quantum neural network structure in the paper is not originally proposed by the authors. The same concept has already been introduced in Paper [1], and the power and the limitations of the single-qubit quantum neural network has been investigated in [2]. Therefore, the reviewers have a negative attitude towards the contribution of the authors of this paper, both in terms of theory and experimentation.\n\n2. The quantum neural network used in this paper is general (i.e., it does not specifically adapt its network structure for graph-structured data). The entire model's capability to handle graph-structured data actually comes from the module preceding the quantum neural network - graph embedding. The graph embedding, proposed by the authors based on quantum random walks, is also well-defined, such as [3,4]. The reviewers, however, have not identified any new contribution from the authors to existing technology.\n\n3. The reviewer notes that the authors did not report the numerical values of the best performance for some baselines in the experimental results table (Table 1). Reviewers would like the authors to provide information on the hyperparameters, the number of parameters, training time, etc., for the sqgnn, sqgnn-dual, and baseline models. This information would facilitate a more in-depth comparison and reproduction for the readers.\n\n4. The reviewer believes that the experimental section lacks crucial comparative experiments. Firstly, the graph embedding technique proposed by the authors based on random walk requires comparison with other graph embedding techniques, including DeepWalk, Node2Vec, matrix factorization, graph neural networks, etc. Secondly, the single-qubit QNN used by the authors also needs to be compared with other paradigms of quantum neural networks, such as hardware-efficient models and quantum neural networks specifically designed for graph-structured data.\n\n\n[1] P\u00e9rez-Salinas A, Cervera-Lierta A, Gil-Fuster E, et al.
