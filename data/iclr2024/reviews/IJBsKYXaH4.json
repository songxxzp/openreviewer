The authors claim GeoDiff assumes distances follows a gaussian distribution. Having read GeoDiff, I do not see this assumption. GeoDiff applies diffusion directly on atomic positions. More so, GeoDiff achieves SE(3) equivariance.\n\n- *Missing baseline*. Torsional diffusion has been out for more than a year and achieves state-of-the-art results on the baselines considered in this work. There is no mention of this paper in the related works and it is missing from the baselines. This is a major red flag.\n\n- *Weird theoretical assumption*. The shifting score from gaussian to MB relies on a huge std (\\sigma=50) until the perturbation kernel matches MB. First, this seems computationally awkward to have to go distances greater than 400 (figure 2). It seems the huge sigma is avoided with the commonly used scaling trick to control the scale of the score matching objective. However, why is it necessary to go this far and force the base distribution to be MB? Why can't we have a normal diffusion between two gaussians? \\sigma=1 looks similar to gaussian to me.\n\n- *Unconvincing results*. The authors claim a new state-of-the-art results. However, they leave out a important baseline and the improvements are extremely small in Table 1. The benefits of SDDiff compared to GeoDiff are within noise. The improvement is at most 0.08 on metrics... Furthermore more difficult benchmarks have been released since [2] almost a year ago. Evaluating against GeoDiff when GeoDiff already achieves 95% seems like the wrong problem to be focusing on.\n\n- *Unexplained analysis*. Section 4.5 is confusing to me. The first part regarding the marginal vs. joint seems to be saying the dependence between distances can be thrown out. This is done without explanation other than a hypothesis and throwing this out makes diffusion on distances no different than diffusion on particles to me. Even in the introduction, diffusion on distances is motivated through the dependence on interatomic forces so throwing them out seems to go against the original motivation. Furthermore, the approximation to OT is very brief and I did not understand the point here.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02923\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01729\n\nWhile I think diffusion on distances rather than particles is interesting for ML on molecules, the formulation in this work confuses me of why it is beneficial (if at all). The results are not convincing and prior works are either mischaracterized or left out. Due these issues, I recomend reject."

The MBD describes the distribution of the length of velocity vectors in an ideal gas, and to some good approximation even in a real molecule. The authors generate molecular conformations based on distances, velocities are never generated nor used (e.g., the math on page 5 after eq 7 only includes distances). It is also unclear how interatomic distances (which are by definition purely positive) or the length of velocities could ever follow a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, the appearance and meaning of velocity v in eq 5 needs to be explained clearly.\n-\tRegarding Section 4.5, if a molecule were to break apart, there will be some correlation of atom-atom distances, i.e., if an atom's distance to another one which is far away in the graph increases this will almost certainly also mean that the distance of the neighboring atom to the far away atom increases. This is more correlation than causation, but it does contain information. Additionally, instead hypothesizing can the authors at least show empirically that their statement is true?\n-\tRegarding the measures COV and MAT. If we assume that a molecule has, e.g., 3 major conformers which are all very close in RMSD. Wouldn\u2019t a model that samples always only one conformer achieve a COV of 1, even though it has never generated the other 2? Also, the definition of MAT seems odd, is there sum over S_r and maybe a min() missing?\n-\tOn page 9: The authors write that it is evident that the proposed distribution matches the Gaussian closely, however, in Fog. 4 the orange distribution appears to be tri-modal Can the authors compute the overlap of orange and blue for the two values of sigma?\n- \tIn Section 4.2, even though D is defined as image(d), R^(n\u00d73)/SE(3) is not isomorphic to D: a molecule and its mirror image would have the same distance matrices, but they are not the same element of R^(n\u00d73)/SE(3) if they are chiral. In this regard, it would be valuable for the authors to clarify how the proposed method handles the generation of conformers for stereoisomers or enantiomers.\n-In Section 5.1, the COV and MAT metrics introduced correspond to the \u201cRecall\u201d version (COV-R and MAT-R, without the typo mentioned below). Some of the baseline methods under comparison, such as GeoDiff (Xu et al., 2022) and Torsional Diffusion (Jing et al., 2022), also include the \u201cPrecision\u201d version (COV-P and MAT-P) to assess the quality of the generated conformers.
