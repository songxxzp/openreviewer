Please see: https://github.com/hyintell/awesome-refreshing-llms for exhaustive references.\n\nWhy: Retrieval-augmented CL seems the closest to this work, as they introduce alternative mechanisms of continual memory neurons. It seems critical to understand how the proposed mechanism differs from existing proposals, as this papers claims (rightly) to be a general mechanism applicable across continual learning settings. \n- I am specifically concerned about the mechanism of sparse selection + updates being better than alternative proposals.\n\nW2) **Comparison between memory stored and images stored by MB [Critical]**\n- The memory here is stored as weight matrices, which are inevitably smaller than storing images -- this in my opinion creates an unfair comparison. \n- This is because CMNs can effectively store more samples than compared approaches, effectively achieving higher performance.\n\nFurthermore: The memory constraint is by equalizing (1) the MB of storage, and (2) too low \n- The proposed deep CMN networks (and comparisons) require higher GPU VRAM than the claimed available space on HDDs! \n\nW3) **Too low absolute numbers on benchmarks to be meaningful, requires significantly better evaluation [Critical]**\nI use MNIST-CI as an illustration to clearly show inadequacies in evaluation. \n- Using a Nearest Class Mean [1] classifier on raw-pixels(!) achieves >85% accuracy on MNIST-CI, whereas reported SOTA here is 78%!\n- For larger datasets, one needs some degree of features beyond raw pixels, but similarly, CIFAR10 performance of 27% is astonishingly low a bar to outperform.\n- Benchmarks in the referenced continual-retrieval augmented transformers would be good candidates to compare performance.\n\nNote that I think the proposed mechanism might be really useful, however the current evaluations seem too under-powered to verify benefits of CMNs.\n\n[1] Mensink etal, Distance-Based Image Classification: Generalizing to new classes at near-zero cost, 2013"

It would be better to showcase the general applicability into multi layer CMNs. A single CMN can be achieved with a more standard online clustering algorithm.\n- To continue with the previous point, a concern with applying CMN to multiple layers is that when the representations are not fully trained or in early layers, committing to the winner memory slot may hinder the learning progress, but more studies would be needed.\n- The memory unit has resemblance to Ren et al. (2021) so it would be great to discuss its relations in the paper. Both works use a slot-based memory module based on input similarity. Both recycle the least used entry and create a new entry if the match strength is below a threshold.\n- Hyperparameters selection of CMN seems like a burden. It would be great to show a list of hyperparameters and their optimal range for each task, and discuss how sensitive these values are.\n\nReferences:\nRen, M., Scott, T. R., Iuzzolino, M.
