The proof of Theorem 1 relies on some sort of MLE guarantee, a confidence bound constructed by the empirical features and relating the empirical bonus to the ground-truth bonus. Such an approach shares similar spirits as previous works studying MDP with low-rank structures (say [1]). I would like to suggest the authors give more comparisons on this.\n2. The result in Theorem 1 seems to critically depend on the newly proposed MLE guarantee in this work. It might be better if discussions about how this MLE guarantee is established and to what extent it differs from previous ones are given.\n3. By \u201ccomputationally efficient\u201d, it in most cases means that the algorithm enjoys polynomial computation efficiency. In some parts of this work, the authors claim that the proposed algorithms are computationally efficient. In my opinion, the proposed algorithm is indeed computationally tractable or oracle-efficient but might not be \u201ccomputation efficient\u201d, since the polynomial efficiency of the proposed algorithm is not guaranteed (correct me if I am wrong).\n\n[1] Uehara et al.

In addition, why we do not need to guarantee $\\mathcal B_{k+1} \\subseteq \\mathcal B_{k}$ here?\n- The sample complexity of the online algorithm is confusing, it looks more like a 'reward-free' paradigm, in which we are concerned about the *sample complexity* instead of the *regret*. When we talk about the 'last iteration regret', we should assume this regret bound works for all $k$ and the algorithm will not change regarding different $k$, which is not the case in this paper: we need to predefine a $K$ and get the sample complexity bound. Thus I think this result is kind of strange.\n- I wonder what will the algorithm look like if we do not only use $V_{theta, b}$ but use the optimistic value function $V_{theta, R} + V_{theta, b}$ in the online algorithm, should the result be the same with (Liu et al., 2023)?\n- Why the constrain related to $p_\\min$ is easy to hold? Is there any theoretical justification? In other words, what will happen if that constrain does not hold for any $\\theta$?"
