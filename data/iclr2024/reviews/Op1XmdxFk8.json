The proposed aggregation loss and the separation loss are same as the Eq. (2) in [1].   \n2. The challenge of fine-grained classification I think lies in its limited data for each class, tens of samples for each class in most benchmark datasets (Table 6 A.2). For CIFAR100, hundreds of samples for each class, the proposed method achieves insignificant perform gains compared to CE (Table 7). Therefore, I think the few-shot works are related and should be included in the literature review.\n3. Some experimental results seem unfair. For the results in Figure 1 and Figure 3, the case where ProtoReg succeeds while others fails is picked up. A question arises here: whether the samples that ProtoReg mis-classify are mis-classified by CE? If so, the extra mis-classification by CE would indicate its deficiency. Otherwise, ProtoReg and CE possibly have different shortcuts. The results presented should be more statistical. \n\nMinor:\n1. The pseudo-code did not include the refinement for the prototypes based on linear classifier weights.\n\nReferences:  \n[1] Snell, J., Swersky, K., & Zemel, R. (2017).

The motivation of this paper is clear. I agree with the authors' viewpoint that there is a granularity gap between the level of information learned by the pre-trained model and the semantic details required for a fine-grained downstream task, which is the main problem to solve in fine-trained transfer learning.\n3.

It does has some novelty, but I am not sure whether it is sufficient to meet the criterion of ICLR.\n2. Although the motivation of solving the problem of granularity gap is interesting, I do not quite understand how the proposed mechanism with prototypes helps to eliminate such \"gap\" under the perspective of transfer learning. In more detail, it seems that this method can also be used to train a randomly initialized model for the fine-grained task, because I do not see a mechanism to \"preserve\" useful information from the original pre-trained model but only recognize the mechanism to make change to the model.\n3. A minor problem: the last sentence of the comments of Figure 1 is confusing. Maybe the word \"suffer from\" is not correctly used."
