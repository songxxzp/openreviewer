This method fits the target function by not only matching its values on the training data, but also matching higher order derivatives, leading to improved convergence speed. \n\nTo understand this effect, the authors study a toy model for training neural networks. They focus on one layer, single node RELU and RELU^2 networks, and they study the dynamics of model parameters under gradient flow-based minimization of the Sobolev loss. The Jacobian of the Sobolev loss has additional terms which are positive semidefinite when $w_0$ is sufficiently close to $w^*$, leading to (potentially) improved convergence speeds. These additional terms are not surprising, since the Sobolev loss can be thought of as a sum of $\\mathcal{L}^2$ loss and additional terms measuring the $\\mathcal{L}^2$ mismatch of gradients, which improve the convergence speed of gradient flow. \n\nFinally, to approximate Sobolev Training in practice, the authors propose to use Chebyshev spectral differentiation, a popular numerical differentiation method. Across a variety of toy experiments, Sobolev Training is shown to accelerate convergence of GD and SGD."

To understand why this is unfair, consider another (trivial) way to accelerate the convergence speed of gradient flow, by rescaling the loss.  Set $\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}}(w) = \\mathcal{L}(w) + \\mathcal{L}(w)$, then in the notation of Theorem 1, $\\partial \\tilde{V} / \\partial t = -2 (w - w^*)^T \\nabla_w \\mathcal{L} \\leq 2 \\partial V / \\partial t < 0$, which is already a significantly stronger 'acceleration' than Theorems 2 and 3 because it converges twice as fast (whereas Theorem 2 and 3 show only convergence that is not any slower than Theorem 1). Simply adding extra convex terms to the loss isn't sufficient to argue an acceleration phenomena, any more than rescaling the loss would be. It would be more fair to average the terms in the Sobolev loss, or to rescale so that $\\mathcal{L}(0) = \\mathcal{H}(0)$, but then Theorems 2 and 3 might not hold.\n- Synthetic/toy experiments: the experimental evaluation in this work is entirely focused training toy objectives.
