The only cross-node information is from the tokens when they are constructed with A and L. This does not seem like a very efficient way of passing information between nodes, as the cross-node information is hardcoded in the tokens.\n- The experiments do not show a large improvement over baseline methods. For example, in Table 2, the ChebNetII baseline performs very well and is not that far off PolyAttn (Cheb). In fact, it outperforms PolyAttn (Mono) on some tasks. This is a bit disappointing since PolyAttn (Mono) is touted as being interpretable, but PolyAttn (Cheb) is the method that outperforms baselines.\n- I may have missed this, but are there any experiments showing how PolyAttn scales to more than one PolyAttn layer?"

Moreover, utilizing tanh() to compute the attention score and the node-shared attention bias also have been proposed and successfully implemented in previous works [2] and [3] respectively.\n2. More challenging datasets need to be added into the experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed PolyFormer, including Actor, Squirrel, Chameleon and ogb-products. The first three are challenging heterophilic datasets and the last one is the representative large-scale graph dataset. Note that, Squirrel and Chameleon should consider the filtered versions proposed in [4]. \n3. I notice that authors conduct the complexity comparison in Section 4.3. The authors keep the total number of parameters approximately same for each model. However, I think the settings of this comparison are not reasonable since it is not the true parameter setting for each model to achieve the best performance on the dataset. Compared to NAGphormer, the proposed PolyFormer introduces order-wise MLP to initialize the query and key matrix, which inevitably increase the training cost. I just wonder the truly training cost of each model on its optimal parameter setting. \n\n\n[1] Chen et al. NAGphormer: A Tokenized Graph Transformer for Node Classification in Large Graphs.

It innovatively introduces node tokens based on polynomial bases to efficiently capture node neighborhood information, which not only allows for minibatch training but also enhances scalability. Furthermore, the paper proposes a Polynomial Attention (PolyAttn) mechanism specifically designed for these polynomial node tokens. PolyAttn serves as a node-wise spectral filter, offering more expressive power than the node-unified filters used in previous works. The Polyformer architecture is built using these polynomial node tokens and the PolyAttn mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that Polyformer outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, effectively handling graphs with up to 100 million nodes."
