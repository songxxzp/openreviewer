The router policy is used to group experts into groups of similar experts. Based on activation frequency, weight permutation-corrected experts in a group are merged together.  \n3.

                "value": "Concerns and questions about presentation:\n\n* What is the intuition behind experts permutation alignment? Specifically, how is \u201calignment\u201d defined? I can understand from performance-wise (Table 6) that alignment is needed. However, I do not understand how two experts are \u201caligned\u201d using the proposed alignment method. To make the paper self-contained, please include the detailed algorithm used for this.\n\n* How are the results in Figure 3 computed? From my understanding, a Switch-base-32 model is first fine-tuned on each individual task, and then the activation frequencies are computed. Are the models fine-tuned with the load balancing loss [1]? It seems in Figure 3, loads of different experts are extremely unbalanced.\n\n* How is the stable-rank computed? For example, in a specific layer, the 32 experts are compressed into 6 experts. Do you compute the average stable-rank of the 32 experts as \u201cbefore\u201d in Figure 4, and the average stable-rank of the 6 experts as \u201cafter\u201d?\n\n* I do not fully understand how experts are grouped. It is mentioned that \u201ceach non-dominant expert gravitates toward and joins the group led by its most similar dominant expert\u201c. For example, suppose we have two dominant experts $E_1$ and $E_2$, then for a non-dominant expert $E$, do you calculate the similarity of $E$ with $E_1$ and $E_2$, and then assign $E$ to the more similar one? If this is true, is it possible that nearly all non-dominant experts are assigned to the same group?\n\n* The pruning of $S$ needs more justification. It is mentioned that \u201cthe weight columns with the lowest cumulative scores will be removed\u201d. Why are weights pruned according to cumulative importance scores instead of importance scores? The pruning procedure in Appendix A2 also seems ad-hoc. How is this particular pruning schedule chosen?\n\n\nConcerns about experiments:\n\n* I would like to further understand the role of knowledge distillation. The authors mention that all the models (including the baselines) in Table 2 use knowledge distillation. Could the authors provide some results of the dense and full-SMoE models without distillation?\n\n* From Table 2, it seems performance of the model considerably drops after applying the compression technique (M-SMoE vs. MC-SMoE). The authors should provide more detailed analysis on the design of the compression method. For example, will different pruning strategies/schedules work better?\n\n* The authors mention \u201cfurther memory and parameter efficiency\u201d in the paragraph above Algorithm 1. However, no experiments are conducted to evaluate the speed and memory of the MC-SMoE models. The latency results in Table A10 indicate that there is only marginal speed gain of M-SMoE compared with full-SMoE. The authors should benchmark the inference speed (throughput) and memory usage of M-SMoE and MC-MoE, and compare the metrics with the dense and the full MoE models.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03961.pdf"
