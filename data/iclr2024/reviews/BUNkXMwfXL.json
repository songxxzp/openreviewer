The paper showed that with the same sampling conditions, diffusion models produce more consistent generation results than GANs, across different training hyper-parameters such as initialization and model structure. The paper found that for \\epsilon-prediction, timesteps close to T (which corresponds to generating high level structure) are easier to optimize than smaller timesteps, leading to consistent generation. Based on the observations, the paper proposed two optimization techniques for diffusion models, curriculum learning based timestep schedule (CLTS) and momentum decay with learning rate compensation (MDLRC), that are demonstrated to enable more efficient training with up to 2.6 speedup."

See Question 1.\n\n2. The paper could provide more concrete implications of the stability phenomenon. Firstly, it seems that there is some connection between stability and overfitting (or memorization). Table 1 showed that the consistency score is higher on smaller images, and Figure 9 showed that the \\epsilon-predicted model can generate images quite similar to Ref. Does this mean diffusion models are easier to overfit? Secondly, the consistency experiment showed that the training is insensitive to certain hyper-parameters and model structures. More concrete guidelines from these results could be useful such as what configs are important and should be carefully tuned for training diffusion models, and what are not."

Moreover, if CLTS improves training efficiency, can it work as a better scheduler for inference too, e.g., by focusing on more important timesteps during sampling?\n\n3. What is the impact of CLTS and MDLRC on the stability phenomenon? Results like consistency scores and visual similarity comparison for these models would be interesting.\n\n4. How is stability related to overfitting? [1] discussed the overfitting-generalization trade-off in VQGAN. In Appendix.E they showed that on face datasets, early-stopping can prevent overfitting and generate new faces, while longer training can reproduce faces in the training set and get smaller FID. Does this conclusion hold for diffusion models on small datasets as well?\n\n5. Does the stability phenomenon exist in text-to-image diffusion models (such as Stable Diffusion) as well?\n\n[1] Esser, Patrick, Robin Rombach, and Bjorn Ommer.

Specifically, they find that diffusion models with different architecture and initialization parameters generate similar images when the initial noise and noise injected at each step remain the same. The authors attribute this consistency to the noise prediction from noisy images in DM learning.\nAdditionally, the paper explores the stability of DMs through the application of 1D interpolation and Hessian spectra techniques. The analysis reveals that the loss landscapes of DMs are notably smoother than those of GANs.\nBased on these findings, the authors propose two optimization methods for diffusion models: the curriculum learning-based timestep schedule (CLTS) and the momentum decay with learning rate compensation (MDLRC). They argue for CLTS is justified by the observation that epsilon prediction approaches an identity function as timestep (t) approaches the total number of steps (T), making it easier to train for t->T, allowing for a curriculum that starts from easier task (t near T) to more challenging ones (t near 0). MDLRC is proposed to address potential oscillation during training caused by large momentum values and favorable loss landscapes of DMs."

For example, if we choose the architecture with skip-connection of $1/\\alpha_t x \u2013 \\sqrt{1/\\alpha_t-1} f_\\theta(x,t)$, mean prediction is equivalent to epsilon prediction with the architecture $f_\\theta(x,t), thus the consistency might be a matter of architectures.\n\nThe paper lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed MDLRC, with only two experiments presented, compromising the credibility of experiments.\n\nSeveral conclusions in the paper remain unexplained or unexplored..\n- Section 4.2 The consistency phenomenon indicates \u2026 are easy to converges.: lacks a clear rationale, as for the epsilon prediction is almost identity does not imply easy convergence. Reverse conclusion is indeed more plausible for me: since denoising is difficult for large noise, timesteps near 0 are easy to converge.\n- Section 4.3 Applying a large momentum value in DMs \u2026 but also cause oscillations,: How large momentum optimization algorithm on a smooth landscape affect convergence efficiency? What oscillations mean?\n- Section 4.3 simply applying momentum decay \u2026 over amplification \u2026 stability of the EMA model.: Why momentum decay cause over amplification and how over amplification affect stability?\n- Section 5.1 The results suggest that the optimal value of \u2026 the most difficult ones to learn.: require additional arguments to support significance of timesteps around 0.3, as the stated results only indicate the superiority of the proposed timestep scheduling with mu 0.3 over ones with other values."
