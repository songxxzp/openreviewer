This can be useful to do relatively expensive soft prompt tuning on small source models and transfer the trained prompt to a bigger target model (compared to training the big model itself). \n\nThe transfer idea involves encoding soft prompts from the source in a \"relative space\" (encode cosine similarity scores between soft prompt tokens and selected source token embeddings - \"anchors\") and then trying to search for target prompts that achieve similar similarity scores against corresponding anchor embeddings of the tokens in the target model. This can be done without backpropagating through the target model. This method can be also extended for multi-source transfer setup."

While the current approach transfers better than naive baselines or baselines based on earlier ideas (discretization, projectors), the transfer itself appears like a lose-lose scenario -- because you have to do extra work for transfer, and then you are (generally) trying to run the target soft prompt in a bigger (or same size) model. This seems pointless if just running the base source model gives us better overall performance. \n\nI am willing to accept this despite this because this paper seems like an early foray into the transfer of soft prompts and can inspire future research while serving as a baseline. Please correct me, however, if I am mistaking something about the immediate practical value of transfer given the current method."
