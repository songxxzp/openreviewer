MS uses a simple screening test to detect and remove potentially malicious gradients from Byzantine workers. The remaining gradients are aggregated using standard momentum SGD. The algorithm is adaptive to the Byzantine fraction $\u03b4$.\n\nThis paper gives theoretical analysis on the proposed algorithm, showing that MS achieves an optimization error of O($\u03b4^2 \u03b6^2_{max}$) for the class $C_{UH}(\\zeta_{max})$. A matching minimax lower bound is also provided for $C_{UH}(\\zeta_{max})$. This rate differs from the rate $O(\\delta \\zeta_{mean}^2)$ for the class $C_{MH}(\\zeta_{mean})$.\n\nExperiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 with neural nets demonstrate MS outperforms existing methods like Centered Clipping, especially for small $\u03b4$. This aligns with the better dependence on $\u03b4$."

In the literature the rate $O(\u03b4\u03b6^2_{mean})$ is derived from $C_{MH}(\\zeta_{mean})$, while this paper gives the rate O($\u03b4^2 \u03b6^2_{max}$) for $C_{UH}(\\zeta_{max})$. Now, to give a better rate, one needs\n$$\u03b4^2 \u03b6^2_{max} \\leq \u03b4\u03b6^2_{mean}  \\Leftrightarrow \\delta \\leq (\u03b6_{mean} / \u03b6_{max})^2, $$\nwhere the RHS is $\\leq 1$ since $ \u03b6_{max} \\geq \u03b6_{mean}$. \nTherefore, **the requirement of $\\delta$ is wrong throughout the paper** (the authors give $\\delta \\leq ( \u03b6_{max}/ \u03b6_{mean})^2$).\nThe authors even did not notice this mistake when they write $\\delta = \\Omega(1)$ (in Section 7) but in fact Byzantine fraction  $\\delta < 0.5$.\nSuch mistake makes me doubt the correctness of the proof in this paper, but I do not have enough time to check the whole proof.\n\n1. As argued in this paper, $ \u03b6_{max} \\gg \u03b6_{mean} $, meaning that the method is only favourable when $\\delta$ is very small, which seems to be not practical in the Byzantine workers setting. Moreover, since $C_{UH}(\\zeta_{max})$ and $C_{MH}(\\zeta_{mean})$ are different hypothesis classes, directly comparing rates seems to be improper. An analysis of MS in $C_{MH}(\\zeta_{mean})$ is also needed.\n\n1. Although the hyperparameter $\\tau_t$ is adaptive to the Byzantine fraction $\\delta$, it has to be be chosen according to $\\zeta_{max}$, which is unknown in priori, so an inproper choice of $\\tau$ could harm the performance of the algorithm. \nIt would be favourable to provide an empirical way to choose $\\tau_t$.\n\n1. For the presentation of the paper, it would be clearer if the author provides a sketch of the proof rather than presenting directly some propositions."

In fact, the rate achieved here seems to be the same as the CCLIP method (Karimireddy et al. (2022)) (ref [1] as below for convenience). Yet, such literature was not well discussed enough in the paper. \n2. Following up the above point, many results in the paper are quite the same as those in CCLIP without improvement, and the analysis is quite natural and motivated from previous work. The true technical novelty of the paper, besides the MS method with simplicity, is perhaps the fact that they proved lower bound in the minimax sense for uniform gradient heterogeneity. However, this is quite a natural extension from the first work that proved such results for the case of mean gradient heterogeneity.\n3. Systematic typo throughout the paper: note that yours is better than CCLIP when $\\delta \\leq ( \\zeta_{mean}/ \\zeta_{max})^2$. Can you give a sense of what $\\zeta_{mean}/ \\zeta_{max}$ can be in real datasets, especially those considered in your experiments? Because I think such fraction can be very small in practice, which is also acknowledged in your Section 2.1. So the regime in which MS provides benefits is in fact quite limited. \n\n\n\n\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09365.pdf"
