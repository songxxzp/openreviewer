                "value": "Previous studies have found that fine-tuning a small subset of layers in a model can achieve comparable or even better performance than full fine-tuning. These methods were based on metrics, known as zero-shot metrics, that measure the importance of network layers to select the optimal one for fine-tuning. However, this paper points out that these metrics perform inconsistently across different models and datasets, making it challenging to use a single metric for universal layer selection. To address this, the paper establishes a dataset that consists of various metrics and their corresponding optimal layers and trains a universal predictor for optimal layer selection using this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the predictor generalizes well across different models and datasets, improving fine-tuning performance while enhancing efficiency."

                "value": "1. The paper does not provide a detailed configuration of the optimal fine-tuning layers for different models on different datasets, making it difficult for readers to identify patterns. Additionally, there is confusion regarding the claim that fine-tuning only a subset of layers can accelerate the process. Generally, fine-tuning deeper layers can be faster since backward propagation does not reach shallower layers. However, achieving downstream generalization often requires fine-tuning parameters in the shallower layers, making it challenging to achieve significant acceleration. Therefore, the authors should provide a specific layer selection for each case and provide a clear explanation of how acceleration is achieved.\n2. The experiments in the paper are not extensive. Since the training is conducted on related models and datasets, there is a high risk of overfitting. Therefore, the proposed method should be validated on a wider range of models and datasets. For example, for visual tasks, validation should be performed on models like ViT, Swin, and VTAB-1K benchmark. For NLP tasks, validation should be performed on newer models like Kosmos, LLaMA 2, and LLMs. Additionally, further validation should be conducted on current multimodal large models such as BLIP-2, MiniGPT-4, LLaVA, etc. Furthermore, the architecture of the ZEST predictor is not clearly explained.\n3. The paper indicates that ZEST is orthogonal to many PEFT methods but only validates its compatibility with LORA in NLP tasks. Considering the existence of many new state-of-the-art PEFT methods, can ZEST also be combined with these methods? For example, in visual tasks: Adaptformer, ConvPass, Fact, and in NLP tasks: Adapter, Prompt tuning, Ladder-side tuning, etc.\n4. Table 1 indicates that a higher Kendall Tau value is better. However, in fact, negative values indicate a negative correlation between variables. Shouldn't the absolute value be used to measure the degree of the correlation?"

Ideas ranging from using forward metrics, such as activations, backward metrics such as gradients and their higher-order approximations such as Fisher co-efficients have been tried and shown some success. Several works also successfully demonstrate that in larger networks, even randomly associated neuron/layer importance/saliency can be a good proxy, due to the incredible plasticity of neural networks to learn to new data.\n\nIn the case of fine-tuning, however, plasticity can become a trouble for generalization, due to catastrophic forgetting. This is particularly so in cases where the fine-tuning dataset target is a small and hard dataset, which often leads to overfitting. Therefore, in cases of sparse fine-tuning, the choice of which parameter to freeze and which not to, is important. The authors suppose that using metrics that measure importance might not be the ideal way and instead learn a meta-model that can predict a layer-wise importance measure. They then use the top-n layers from this measure for fine-tuning. Although not completely original, this is novel and is sound reasoning. \n\nThe standard metrics used to support their cases are also used to learn their meta-model and these are well-chosen. The experiments show that there is some value in training a meta-model, by being better than almost all standard metrics. Considering that their method abstracts out the metric measurement model from the system for the actual sparse fine-tuning, their work can be seamlessly combined with other fine-tuning techniques."

I feel the layer evaluation metrics, or so called zero-shot metrics in this paper, are the most important component for this type of works. However, regretfully **none of the metric introduced in this paper (see Sec 3.1) is new**. The metric formulas in Sec 3.1 have very high overlap with the reference paper Abdelfattah et al. 2021. Similarly, the layer contribution score is simply inferred from one layer/block fine-tuning accuracy, which is not novel either. \n\n- The proposed method comes with a strong assumption, which is that the authors **assume the layer contribution score could be approximated with low computational cost by mini-batch data**. I would like to elaborate why such assumption is wrong. (1) First, it is straightforward that different mini-batch will result in highly biased and noisy metrics scores. This means for each dataset, there is no guarantee different mini-batch could result in stable and reliable evaluation statistics for each individual layer/block in deep neural networks. Even for the same mini-batch data, the zero-shot metrics (input to the ZEST predictor) keep changes as the model parameter is being fine-tuned. Do the authors collect such zero-shot metrics throughout model fine-tuning (inferenced under different $\\Theta$s as the training data or collect that from the initial $\\Theta$? (2) Second, for generalizing to testing datasets, the method would additionally assume the prediction model to be able to make prediction given the highly stochastic mini-batch statistics on unseen data. For secure generalization on unseen dataset, the authors adopt a very simple trick, which is to mix the data from different datasets in a minibatch. I am not convinced such trick could ensure the generalization ability of the predictor on such an unrealistic task on completely unseen dataset.  Overall, the task of estimating block/layer importance based on mini-batch data in the presented way fails to convince me.\n\n- For all such layer-wise pruning methods, the most time consuming part is the data construction part. For this work, the authors adopt a non different data collection approach, where only one layer is fine-tuned to collect the $Score_{gt}$ (see **Training Label Collection** part in Figure 2).  If comparing the entire time from data collection to final model fine-tuning, I do not feel the total time efficiency is reduced in a great deal. \n\n- In the abstract, the authors make very strong claim about the benefit of ZEST, saying their method **can decrease the number of trainable parameters by up to 99%, performing on par with full fine-tuning**. However, from the other part of this paper, it seems the sparsity of fine-tuning with ZEST is not as low and how the statistic of 99\\% is derived is not explained from anywhere. I suggest the authors to carefully revise the writing of this paper to remove such overclaims. \n\n- One major flaw of this paper is that for the main benchmark results (shown in Table 3), the authors did not explicitly specify which performance evaluation metric they use to make the comparison for BERT and LLAMA, while there could be many possibilities to consider. Also, the claim that **ZEST with 5 layer could outperform LLAMA's full fine-tuning by up to 5\\%** is highly suspicious, because the reported performance score for LLAMA FT-Full on the *hellaswag* dataset is much lower than the publicly reported standards (e.g., refer to the scores for LLAMA-7b from https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/2321). \n\n- Important details about the datasets and model training are missing. It is necessary to describe dataset statistics, model properties and training details apart from learning rate and mini-batch size.\n\n- The author claim ZEST can be used orthogonal to the other method LoRA. However, adding LoRA to ZEST regretfully lowers the performance and does not bring positive effect (see Table 3). In this case, the conclusion seems to highlight the WEAKNESS or LIMITATION of ZEST, rather than its strength, diminishing the significance of this work.\n \n- The experiment is not convincing also because that essential fine-tuning baselines are missing from the benchmark comparison. For the main results shown in Table 3, apart from ZEST variants, the authors only include two very simple fine-tuning baselines: **zero-shot** and **FT-Full**, which is insufficient. I believe there are many layer-wise deep neural net pruning methods that is related to this work. It is essential to include up-to-date SOTA fine-tuning baselines (e.g., [1]). \n\n[1] AutoLR: Layer-wise Pruning and Auto-tuning of Learning Rates in Fine-tuning of Deep Networks (AAAI'21). \n\n- Ablation study of ZEST is not comprehensive. I feel simply comparing with completely random baselines (e.g, Rand@3 and Rand@5 from Figure 3) is a bit unfair. It would be more interesting if random baselines which employ a combination of ZETA suggested layers and purely randomly chosen layers could be investigated. \n\n- The authors focus on reporting the benchmark performance scores on the hold-out testing datasets, while the performance scores on the training datasets would be also interesting and important for the readers to know. I suggest the authors to add more comprehensive comparison results, with more inclusive datasets and related pruning baselines. \n\n- The term **zero-shot metrics** sounds very confusing to me. From my understanding, those metrics, when being talked about for the training datasets, is not zero-shot at all. I feel it is not appropriate to name the metrics as zero-shot. Related work referenced paper, such as Abdelfattah et al. 2021, also does not use such term. \n\n- From Fig 2, the prediction result of ZEST is fed to a **pair-wise ranking loss**. In the entire paper, such loss is not talked about at all. It is said the **$Score_{gt}[i]$** is given as the label for ZETA, with which supervised training can be done. Why additional ranking loss is there? Also, it is unclear why for **ZEST Inference**, no ranking information is inferenced and only **$Score_{gt}[i]$** is inferenced? \n\n- The related work section is poorly written because it covers very limited literature on the most important layer-wise sparse fine-tuning methods, and the discussion on transfer learning seems too long. There are plenty of such works from the literature. The authors should discuss on them in detail."

                "value": "- From your algorithm (i.e., the **Sparse Fine-Tuning** part in Sec 3.2), you always use **top-n** layers with highest ZEST scores for fine-tuning. Does this mean no matter what testing datasets come in, you always predefine the number of layers as a hyperparameter? I wonder whether there is a way to verify the quality or sensitivity of ZEST prediction scores to identify optimal number of layers that can be customized to each testing dataset. From the training efficiency perspective, it seems not a good idea to always fix the number of n in your top-n fine-tuning strategy.\n\n- In introduction, the authors claim **ZEST is 1000x more efficient than previous methods**. I wonder what is the 1000x in terms of? How exactly it is measured, e.g., how many datasets, compared to WHICH previous methods, is it for training or only inference, etc. In many other parts of this paper, there are also similar claims, e.g., 2.7x, 2.3x, for which, I think the authors should state more clearly how the numbers are derived."
