However, the narrative lacks a coherent demonstration of how GRASP mitigates these inefficiencies. The empirical section, intended to validate the method's enhanced efficiency, does not decisively support this assertion. Specifically, the performance metrics juxtaposed with existing strategies such as GREED and ERIC suggest comparable efficiencies, an outcome that muddles the purported superiority of GRASP in this domain. The authors should consider a more nuanced exposition of the method's unique efficiencies, supplemented by robust experimental evidence, to substantiate claims of its advancement over current practices. \\\nW3: The authors assert that prevailing cross-graph interaction modules contribute significantly to computational overheads. However, the delineation of how their proposed GRASP framework, which ostensibly employs similar cross-graph interactions via NTN, innovates upon or diverges from traditional methodologies is ambiguous. This lack of clarity muddles the reader's understanding of any novel contributions the paper might be making in this specific aspect of the framework. It is imperative for the authors to elucidate the nuanced operational differences, if any, introduced by GRASP that ameliorate the time-costly nature of cross-graph interactions, distinctly setting their approach apart from conventional ones. This clarification could significantly enhance the perceived value and ingenuity of their methodology."

                "value": "1. The authors presented MSE on predicted similarity scores (obtained by exponentiating a normalized version of GED) instead of predicted GED. Given the task is to predict GED, results should be reported on GED itself and not its transformation to a similarity metric that distorts the true errors. While some previous works such as SIMGNN have also followed the same methodology of reporting results on exponentiated similarity instead of true GED, there is no justification for this transformation.\n\n2. The statistics of the data used for training, validation, and inference are not provided in the paper, which are important to understand the quality of results.\n\n3. The MSE scores of baselines reported in the paper do not align with the existing literature. For example, GREED outperforms other baselines such as H2MN, SIMGNN in the literature but it is not reflected in this paper. What is the source of this discrepancy? Were all methods trained on error over GED or over the similarity score. The authors need to release the version of code they used benchmarking the baselines and the exact loss function so that reproducibility and any source of discrepancy can be properly analyzed.\n\n4. Experiments are not extensive. \n* The heat maps are provided for the AIDS700nef dataset where graphs are of small sizes. Heatmaps on datasets with larger graphs such as PTC give a better idea of the performance of Grasp and those need to be included.\n* It is not clear how Grasp generalizes for unseen graph sizes. Given that generating ground truth for graphs with larger sizes is expensive, it is interesting to see how Grasp performs when training is done with smaller graphs and testing is done on larger unseen graphs. This aspect needs to be compared with other state-of-the-art baselines such as GREED and H2MN.\n\n5. The estimated GED didn\u2019t include costs for relabeling of edges. The authors didn\u2019t mention how to extend this work to include edge substitution costs.\n\n6. The novelty of GRASP is limited apart from using positional encoding. Grasp tackles the issue of cross-graph interactions, although it's important to recognize that Greed had already addressed this limitation before Grasp.\n\n---------------------------\nOverall, I am willing to revisit the rating, if the authors address concerns on reproducibility (release of baseline implementations used, train-test-validation stats, loss function clarifications), reported results include performance on true GED instead of transformed similarity that distorts performance due to exponentiation, and more detailed experiments in terms of generalizability to unseen, larger sizes, heatmaps, etc."

                "value": "1. It's unclear whether the reported MSE scores for GRASP are a result of the loss computed using the GED or similarity scores (obtained after normalization of GED). The code, specifically Line 170 in src/trainer.py, appears to calculate the loss using GED/Similarity score based on the command line parameters. A consistent methodology is required across all datasets and baselines. Hence, this needs to be clarified.\n\n2. Are the baseline models trained to output GED scores or similarity scores (obtained after normalization of GED)? Models such as GREED are trained to output GED, training them to output similarity scores might affect the performance.\n\n3. How is the Neural Tensor Network (NTN) affecting the performance of the method? Have you considered using only L2-Norm to predict GED, which will preserve the metric property as well? This analysis is not included in the ablation study.\n\n4. What are the statistics of train-validation-test sets?\n\n5. How does the accuracy vary with query size and GED on datasets with larger graphs?\n\n6. What are the RMSE scores of GRASP and other baselines on GED?"
