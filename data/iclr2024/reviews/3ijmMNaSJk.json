The paper is heavily empirical and makes several key observations:\n1. MD mitigates attention homogenization, where the model's response is diffused across a broad and unrelated area for specific queries; 2. the features learned through MD exhibit lower frequency than those learned without MD;\n3. MD produces higher singular values for each hidden layer's activations;\n4. the entropy of the features learned through MD is higher;\n5. MD provides a smoother loss landscape for training."

The empirical results' distinction from previous analyses on regular MIM (as presented in 'Revealing the Dark Secrets of Masked Image Modeling') is unclear. Given the similarities between MIM and MD, I worry that the work, which shows MD performing similarly to MIM, may have limited impact.\n3. Several analyses (attention distance, entropy) appear to be borrowed from the aforementioned previous work.\n4. The introduction lacks structure. It disproportionately focuses on MIM, whereas I would expect a more detailed introduction and comparison between MIM and MD for a paper centered on MD."

Could visualizing the distance between different attention heads provide more clarity?\n2. The authors claim that MD amplifies the model\u2019s preference for low-frequency features while enhancing the preference for high-frequency features in the lower layers. However, from my understanding of the figure, it seems that MD only promotes high-frequency features in the lower layers for SSL (blue). Could you clarify?\n3. I don't see the necessity of splitting section 3 and section 4 into two sections. Both sections compare different properties between MD and non-MD."

Comparing masked distillation with SL, SSL is similar to [A]. Thus, it is hard to contribute to other researchers.\n\n- What masked distillation does the paper use for experiments? As described in Fig. 3 (c), there are diverse variants of masked distillation. Can the paper's implementation (*_MD) be enough to represent all variants of masked distillation?\n\n- I believe analysis metrics are strongly related to ImageNet-1k performance.

They should be measured by the distance between probabilities, such as KL divergence or cross-entropy. Please use the correct metrics for them.\n\n- The main quantitative results for attention diversity and homogeneity (Figure 10) are in the appendix. I think the main results should be included in the main script. The current paper is the same with no quantitative results for attention diversity and homogeneity.\n\n- What is the meaning of frequency analysis in transformer architecture? I believe frequency is reasonable for ConvNet but meaningless for Transformer.\n\n- In Fig 6 (a), SL_MD has lower NMIs compared to SL, which is different from the explanation of the paper. \n\n- How does the loss landscape for SL and SL_MD look like? The loss landscape is a good tool for measuring over-fitting. Thus, I want to know why SL is excluded from the experiment.\n\n- Fu et al. 2023 [G] is a study on SGD.
