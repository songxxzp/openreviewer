As the authors note in the background section, other methods already use data stored from previous experiments, so the only novelty here is that *data is not discarded*. There is no theoretical analysis in the paper. Without significant novelty or theory, the paper depends solely on its empirical results.\n- Storing all previous data is memory intensive, which is why offline RL generally uses more complicated techniques to learn from limited data. The authors do not discuss this drawback of their method, but I could see it being a bottleneck in long experiments with high-dimensional observations.\n- It is unclear that replaying offline data from a long time ago is as beneficial as the authors claim. Table 1 seems to indicate that performance improves almost monotonically as the proportion of online data increases to 90%. The authors claim that \u201cas more data becomes available, a lower ratio [of 70-80%] works better,\u201d but this only happens occasionally, and the performance improvement is small (about 2-5%). Without any measure of significance provided, it does not seem that more than 10% offline data actually helps much.\n- The results are rather noisy and would benefit from increasing the number of trials (which is currently only 5). I would recommend that the authors use a 95% confidence interval instead of standard deviation and apply a 100-episode moving average (if they are not already doing so already) to make the results easier to read. Currently, some of the standard deviations are overlapping, but I think the results would be significant if confidence intervals are used instead.\n\n**Minor edits:**\n- In-text citations are not rendered correctly on the last line of page 1.\n- In the background section, the range of discount values should be mentioned: $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$.\n- I think it would be helpful to the reader to define the scientific notation shorthand the first time it is used, e.g., $\\text{4e5} = 4 \\times 10^{-5}$."

Have you considered doing so? \n\n- RaE only incorporates the previous data at the beginning of optimization. What about training on the data throughout the optimization process? For example, keeping the buffer of previous data and sampling from it occasionally or mixing in samples into minibatches. \n\n- As I mentioned in strengths section, I think training across-experiments could be relevant for practical purposes. How do you see it being used in a scientific context? It could be difficult to fairly assess algorithms if the data they have access to depends on the sequence of previous experiments done. i.e. an advantage of discarding previous data is that algorithms start on equal ground in different papers, allowing fair comparisons. \n\n- I'm a bit surprised that doing some offline learning first is so detrimental to the policy (Fig. 4, finetuning and AWAC). Intuitively, I would guess that there should be a jumpstart in the performance due to the additional offline training. Could you clarify this?\nDo you have any hypotheses why these methods don't perform very well here?\n\n- Currently, the experiments that use RaE are quite similar to simply using resets but at the end of each experimental run. It would be interesting to see some experiments where the same algorithm was not used in consecutive experiments or, at least, changing hyperparameters. This could better simulate the development process of an RL algorithm. \nAs a suggestion, I would be curious to see if hyperparameter optimization could be made easier. Since RL agents can be sometimes hard to run initially on a new problem, we might be able to more easily identify which hyperparameter settings are promising by giving the agent additional data."
