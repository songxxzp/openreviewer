                "value": "This paper inspects the coreset selection problem. A balanced core-set loss bound is first established to depict the generalization loss of the model trained on the subset. The authors claim that the bound is composed of two terms, one corresponds to the \u201cdiversity/coverage\u201d of the coreset, and the other counts for the \u201cdifficulty\u201d of the samples. The bound naturally unifies the diversity-based as well as the difficulty-based works developed previously, and the paper further provides an expressive importance function to optimally balance them. The authors find that the optimal balance is related to the subset size. In the data-scarce regime, the subset is supposed to be representative enough (diverse), while in the data-abundance regime, difficult samples are preferred. The resulting coreset selection strategy is named diversity-difficulty Balanced One-shot Subset Selection (BOSS), Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

In theroem2, the authors claim that EL2N lower bound the label variability in difficult regions. I wonder if this holds for other regions as EL2N/difficulty is universally used in Equation (5). Besides, to minimize Equation (1), for the label variability term, we should minimize something upper bounds $|| \\boldsymbol{y}_i -  \\boldsymbol{y}_j ||$ instead of something lower bounds it like EL2N.\n\n2.\tThe authors claim that the subset size will affect the optimal diversity-difficulty balance, in data data-scarce regime, the diversity dominates while as the subset budget increases, more difficult samples should be picked. While intuitively true and the authors give intuitive explanations, I can\u2019t directly justify the statement directly from the core-set loss bound. More discussion will greatly strengthen the paper.\n\nI will be happy to increase my score if the problems are addressed."

To fully understand the effect of the additional I(.) term, the authors should compare with the facility location submodular function.\n\n- The authors discuss multiple relevant papers in this work but do not add comparison with many of them in the experiments. It would be great to compare with a few more method, e.g., Grad Match.\n\n- The 'balanced' aspect of the proposed loss is still not clear to me. It would be imperative to add some experiments to show how the selected subsets are balanced. It would be even better if the authors can show some experiments on class imbalanced data. Most datasets currently in the experiments barely have any imbalance, which makes this analysis difficult."
