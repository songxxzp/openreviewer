                "value": "This paper proposes CHATS (CHatty Agents Text-to-Speech), a system for transforming written dialogue into spoken dialogue, whose content is coherent with the input written dialogue but generated with backchannels, laughter, and smooth turn-taking. Several contributions are announced: a method to prepare written dialogue by excluding backchannels, a mechanism for taking turns in conversation, and a Multi-Stream Dialogue Transformer Language Model. Paper builds upon previous work, such as dGSLM and Dialogue Transformer Language Model by Nguyen et al. in 2023 and it provides evaluations for different parts of the proposed system, including the dialog model, turn-taking model, and back-channeling model. \n\nWhen I take a closer look, it's clear that paper has too much stuff in it. There are many models and evaluations crammed together in one document w/o enough details of each of them. This makes it hard to read and understand the paper. It's unfortunate because this is an ambitious and relevant research objective that is described here. Current version of the paper needs a big re-organization to make it clearer and maybe each problem addressed should correspond to a single paper with deeper / more detailed description and evaluation; that would allow reader/reviewer to better understand and appreciate the valuable insights it offers."

This makes it challenging for me to evaluate, and it limits its accessibility since only Japanese speakers can understand it. English examples would have been more universal.\n\n- In the contributions mentioned in the paper, it is not clear why \"Conversion from Spoken to Written Dialogue\" is valuable or innovative. Authors mention using both rule-based and machine learning approaches to identify backchannels and exclude them from written dialogues, but the paper lacks detail on the challenges this addresses. Is it mainly about data preprocessing?\n\n- As said above, the paper's structure needs improvement, as it tries to cover too many topics in one document.\n\n- The paper builds on the work of dGSLM (Nguyen et al., 2023) and the Dialogue Transformer language model (DLM) (Nguyen et al., 2023), but it doesn't provide enough information about these previous models to make this paper self-understandable\n\n- Section 3.1.2 seems to be a core part, but it's too brief to fully understand its significance."

This system generates speech for both the speaker and the listener simultaneously, using only the transcription from the speaker side by finetuning the modified dGSLM model with careful curation and pre-processing of natural dialog. The overall pipeline is similar to the one used by the dGSLM system; however using the careful finetuning process delivers very strong results and a practical tool for enriching the dialogs with natural spoken dialog properties. \n\nThe model has extensive experiments to show that the utterance quality is good, the dialog segments contain high quality of close to ground truth backchannels and pauses and the turn taking events also resemble the ground truth. Most important, the qualitative human evaluation experiments also show very good naturalness, meaningfulness and sound quality."
