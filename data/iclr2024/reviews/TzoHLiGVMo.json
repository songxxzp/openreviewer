This innovative approach allows researchers and practitioners to create ODE models that can accurately capture and represent the dynamics of real-world systems, providing a valuable tool for testing and understanding the behavior of complex dynamical systems.\n\nODEFormer introduces a pioneering use case for transformers in the realm of ODEs. Traditionally, transformers are employed in natural language processing and sequential data tasks. However, in this context, they are harnessed to directly infer ODE systems from noisy and irregularly sampled data. This expansion of transformer applications into the domain of ODEs signifies a breakthrough, offering a versatile and data-driven approach for modeling and analyzing complex dynamic systems, and opening up new possibilities for the fusion of machine learning techniques with physics-based modeling."

                "value": "One notable limitation in the presented work is the absence of comparisons with benchmarks employed in previous studies, such as the widely recognized benchmark datasets used in Neural ODE (Chen et al). This absence makes it challenging to gauge how the proposed ODEFormer framework performs in comparison to existing approaches on well-established and widely accepted testing scenarios.\n\nThe demonstrated applicability of ODEFormer on toy datasets represents another potential limitation. Toy datasets are typically simplistic and may not fully capture the complexity and variability encountered in real-world applications. Therefore, the extent to which ODEFormer can effectively handle and model more complex, real-world data remains an open question and warrants further investigation and validation on diverse and challenging datasets."

            "questions": {
                "value": "One key aspect that warrants further exploration is the practical application of the technique on real-world datasets. While the framework shows promise in artificially constructed datasets, its effectiveness in solving real-world problems, where data can be noisy, irregularly sampled, and complex, remains to be demonstrated. Evaluating its performance on non-artificial, real-world datasets across various domains, such as finance, healthcare, or environmental monitoring, would provide valuable insights into its applicability and limitations in practical scenarios.\n\nTime series data indeed represents a compelling use case for the framework. Time series forecasting is a critical application in various fields, including finance, energy, and climate modeling. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the applicability of this method in a time series forecasting modeling scenario. Demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately modeling and predicting time-dependent data can significantly enhance its practical utility and establish its relevance in solving real-world, dynamic data challenges."

There is no attempt to illustrate the difference at all.\n\nI have another point which I would like to bring up with the authors regarding the generation of the data, specifically the way it is being integrated. As mentioned (and I think this is reasonable as a first step) the authors using fixed homogeneous grid to integrate, and it is claimed that number of points don't matter during inference (Figure 3), is this indeed an artifact of the way the data is generated. How do the results change when the integration procedure is altered, it would be great to have the authors comment on this issue.\n\nPlease see questions section for further."

As acknowledged that this is closely related, it should be clearly articulated what are the differences. The mentioning of difference between univariate and multivariate is okay, but this needs more explanation. I strongly believe this should be a baseline for comparison in some setting.\n\n2) How should one think about inferring PDE with a variant of this framework, can we have a discussion around this as part of limitation if that is the case? \n\n3) The learning from multiple trajectories, doesn't seem to give promising performance, do authors have comments on explaining this behavior?\n\n4) For the noise corruption of the data, the authors have tried out adding Gaussian noise and dropping samples uniformly at random. Can authors comment on missing chunks of data instead. This might be of practical implication in certain cases, where the data collection mechanism (sensor) went faulty for some time before resuming activity."
