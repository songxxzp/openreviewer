                "value": "- The main idea of this paper is essentially an object cut-paste augmentation, which has been exploited as a common practice in most 3D object detectors. For example, starting from Point R-CNN, those 3D object detectors leverage object cut-paste to augment the 3D driving scenes. The proposed object anchor selection, normalization, and placement share very similar spirits with Point R-CNN [1] and Back-to-Reality [2].\n\n- The contrastive learning strategy has also been studied by many relevant papers. For example, CLIP^2 [3] leverages contrastive learning to align the text and point cloud representations for open-vocabulary 3D object detection.\n\n- Text prompts are generated by pre-defined rules and lack generalization ability.\n\n- The proposed detection framework didn't change much compared to the existing detectors. The detector is trained with supervised learning and doesn't rely on open-vocabulary foundation models such as CLIP. Hence it is hard to say whether the proposed method has the open-vocabulary detection ability, as the detection vocabulary is actually constrained by the 3D object datasets. \n\n- Evaluation is also questionable: The authors split the datasets into seen and unseen categories, but those unseen categories are not really ``unseen\", since the 3D object datasets they used can have those categories. Hence it is an unfair comparison with the baseline methods. \n\n- Essentially this paper is not an open-vocabulary 3D detection paper. It is 3D detection with categories augmentation by inserting new objects from 3D object datasets. The detected categories are bounded by the used object datasets.\n\n[1] Shi et al.

That paper covers the exact same idea of placing random objects into random locations to create diverse training rooms. To me it seems critical to discuss this work, and differentiate from it in some concrete ways.\n\nThe paper says \"With the proposed cross-domain category-level contrastive loss, the model is forced to learn generalizable feature representations based on their class labels irrespective of the source dataset of the objects.\" It is unclear to me why the contrastive loss will force generalizable features. I think the high-level idea here is that the contrastive loss will make the features more similar within a class, but this effect is already achieved by the classification loss. Although empirically the contrastive loss may help further still, I don't think the given explanation really works. \n\nSection 3.2 is very difficult to follow. I am lost from the first sentence: \"The 3D object insertion approach composes new 3D scenes with original scenes annotated by seen categories and new objects from large vocabulary categories covering seen and unseen categories.\" I think a comma will be good somewhere, or maybe this sentence can be broken into multiple sentences. The notation <target - class><spatial - relationship><anchor - class> is confusing for me. If these are 2-tuples, what is a \"spatial\" and what is a \"relationship\"? Finally this section states that the \"Absolute Location Prompt\" is proposed as a mechanism to validate the \"Relative Location Prompt\", but it is unclear how this mechanism works. The end of that paragraph is confusing as well, as it seems to say (via double negatives) that the prompts might be less unclear\u00a0than the relative ones (\"such prompts are limited by fewer ways of expression and unclear descriptions which may not be discriminative\")."
