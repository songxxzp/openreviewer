If the noise is transferable in semi-supervised heterogeneous domain adaptation, it also can be transferred in the unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation, it is unclear why the authors limit this strong conclusion in the semi-supervised scenarios.  \n2.\tAccording to Section 5, the authors claim that the label information of the source sample might not be the primary factor that influences the performance of SHDA. Since the authors conduct the experiments with some large models like JMEA. It employs the ResNet-50, a very deep pre-trained network, which might contain some label information. Therefore, it cannot sufficiently reflect that the label information is useless. It is suggested that the authors should employ a lighter neural architecture like AlexNet to evaluate the proposed idea.  \n3.\tSince the authors evaluate the performance in the semi-supervised scenario, it is suggested that the authors should provide the experiment results of training with labeled target data. Because I doubt that some target-labeled data with a reasonable learning rate (to avoid overfitting) might be enough for the ideal performance.  \n4.\tIn the part \u2018Study on feature information of source samples\u2019, the authors use features with different dimensions to denote different information, for example, D(4096) contains more information than D(800). This might be unreasonable since features with different dimensions might contain equal information."

There is no doubt that the order of category indices would not affect the performance since they are just symbols without any semantics. Additionally, I do not think label information can be regarded as category indices.\n2. In Figure 3, the performance of SSAN changes significantly when the feature dimension changes, making the conclusion that feature information is not the dominant factor not convincing.\n3. In the experiment of Table 1, I think the method of not adopting transfer learning should be included since both true source samples and noises may be unhelpful in this experiment.\n4. In section 6, only one target domain is tested.\n5. In the experiment of \u201coriginal discriminability\u201d, I do not think category replicate and category shift are appropriate. Category replicate assigns the same category label to different category samples, which would damage the training. This damage is more serious when K is larger. So, we can not know whether the discriminability or damage causes the effect. Category shift does not alter the internal distribution. Instead, I regard the Gaussian with different means and variances to be better. Specifically, larger mean and variance differences between categories represent larger discriminability. Additionally, the conclusion that the primary source of transferable knowledge in SHDA tasks does not lie in the original discriminability of source samples is not convincing since the performance improves when LDA values increase in NK3,4,5 and 6.\n6. Why the metrics for measuring discriminability are different in the experiments of \u201coriginal discriminability\u201d and \u201ctransferable discriminability\u201d? Concretely, one is LDA values, and the other is empirical risk.\n7. In Table 2, why report the average accuracy of seven methods instead of individual results as in previous experiments? It makes me feel suspicious.\n8. The authors consider the noises to be transferable and the key factor to be the transferable discriminability. However, the comparison of the transferable discriminability of true samples and noises are not given in Table 2 and 3."
