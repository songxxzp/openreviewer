In addition, it proposes multistep unrolling, predicting the clean image at multiple timesteps and apply the segmenter-based discriminator. The experiments are on the classical segmentation datasets ADE20K and Cityscapes. The model exhibits comparable pixel level alignment and image fidelity. Different type of L2I synthesis adaptation models and segmenters are tested, to demonstrate its effectiveness."

Because of better pixel alignment? If that's the case, is better mIoU always means better local controllability? For example, can the one trained on frozen segmenter exhibits better local controllability?\n3. Why larger number of unrolling steps is always better? Have you tried any K>9? Do all steps contribute the similar gradient magnitude or some of them is more important? What if we omit some of the earlier steps?"

It is shown in the paper that there's incremental value in both. The method is evaluated on two datasets (ADE20K and Cityscapes), and the proposed method is showns to be superior to several recent baselines (T2I-Adapter, FreestyleNet and ControlNet) qualitatively, as well as quantitatively. Finally, the method is applied on a domain generalization task, and is shown to perform best against the baselines there."

I.e. in Table 3, the frozen UperNet achieves the best mIoU, but much worse FID - consistent with the hypothesis that the impact of the segmentation network is just too strong. Verying the impact of the segmentation loss relative to the diffusion loss while fine-tuning would clarify this.\n- The introduction gave a good intuition for the whole method. However, the combination of diffusion models with adversarial methods remains ad-hoc, and there's no theoretical justification for the validaty of the approach given. It should be either worked out, or at least added for future work that propoer understanding of diffusion-adversarial coupling should be investigated (to make these methods work best together).\n\nSmaller things:\n- Figure 1 lowest right image: this example shows that the method doesn't yet work perfectly. The top part of the truck is a building (see the windows and the 'roof structure'). It should be pointed out in the paper that some failed cases still persist (even if harder to see).\n- In \"Related Work\" you write \"more attention has been devoted to leveraging pretrained knowledge for the L2I task and using diffusion models\"; I think this is an important point, and should already be part of the motivation of the general method in the Introduction."

I'd expect that to work best.\n- for the case of a frozen pre-trained segmenter: did you train a diffusion model plus an additional loss for the segmentation model? That is surprising, because I wouldn't have expected the diffusion model to collapse in such case (the same training method/loss is still there)."

Adversarial supervision on the semantic maps is identical as in OASIS. Multistep unrolling is computationally very expensive (scales linearly and hence can take up x9 longer), and has a small effect on the performance.\n- The results (while improving over the diffusion baselines) are behind OASIS, a GAN from 2020.\n- The motivation to use a strong text-to-image model and adapt it for semantic image synthesis is flawed. The paper motivates it by enabling text-conditioned content and style transfer, but the semantic mask completely specifies the content. Hence, the application is reduced to text-guided style and color transfer. \n- Furthermore, the proposed model does not perform style transfer well. When changing to a snowy scene, the whole image and all objects are resampled. Local editing is also not possible. Instead, the whole image is affected when changing \"a red van\" to \"a burning van\". \n- A simple baseline combining OASIS and a state-of-the-art style transfer model should be considered.\n\nSide remarks:\n- Layout-to-image is usually referred to as a task that transforms a list of bounding boxes and class labels into an image [1,2]. This paper tackles semantic image synthesis where the input is a label mask (each pixel is labelled).\n- The paper states that Stable Diffusion based models do not comply well with layout input, but see [3,4]\n\n[1] Image Synthesis From Reconfigurable Layout and Style, https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07500\n[2] LayoutDiffusion: Controllable Diffusion Model for Layout-to-image Generation, https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17189\n[3] SpaText: Spatio-Textual Representation for Controllable Image Generation, https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14305\n[4] ReCo: Region-Controlled Text-to-Image Generation, https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15518"
