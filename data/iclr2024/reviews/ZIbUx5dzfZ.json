The principle is that sampled images should have aligned contexts with the training set and be \"bias conflicting\". It trains a debiased model using the training set and selected examples. It conducts experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmrak datasets."

Authors should clarify.\n\n- The paper emphasizes the phrase \"dataset bias problem\" but it is not clear what it means. Is it a new problem proposed in the paper? If so, authors should clarify. Otherwise, authors should cite related papers.\n\n- In Introduction, the paper uses \"ski\" as a motivational example. Concretely, the paper explains \"the images of \u201cski\u201d exhibit a spurious correlation with \u201csnow,\u201d and the snowy background is considered the bias attribute. Conversely, samples captured in a desert environment (e.g., desert skiing) would be bias conflicting samples.\" However, isn't it reasonable to have snow in \"ski\" images. In other words, \"ski\" is \"ski\", \"desert ski\" is a different sport. Authors should clarify.\n\n- Figure 1 is confusing. It is not clear what pink and blue boxes mean, both are labeled as \"bias-conflicting\".\n\n- In Section 2.1, the examples in the first two paragraphs are conflicting. The writing should be improved.\n\n- Table 2 is hard to read. It has a poor caption.\n\n- In terms of Observation 1, it is confusing to assign arbitrary labels to mined images as a compared method. Shouldn't a reasonable baseline be that of training without extra data? Moreover, what is the dataset used to report numbers for the observations?\n\n- The paper writes \"assigns labels based on cosine similarity\", it is not clear why using \"cosine similarity\"? Why not entropy, softmax scores, etc.?\n\n- Table 3 is hard to understand. Does it sample relevant data or just randomly sample data for pseudo labeling? It misses crucial details for understanding.\n\n- The paper motivates the first key point, \"avoid focusing solely on selecting bias conflicting samples\". But it is not clear why it should \"avoid solely selecting bias conflicting samples\". Authors should clarify.\n\n- The paper writes \"To tackle this issue, we emply a self-supervised learning mechanism that does not rely on target labels\". However, images by themselves deliver bias or spurious correlation. So why does self-supervised learning tackle the issue of data bias?\n\n- It is not well motivated to use class centroid in self-supervised learning. Can authors explain this design choice? Why is it better than the typical contrastive loss?\n\n- The debias loss L_{tr} is not defined. Authors should define it before using it.\n\n- The paper writes \"Furthermore, we evaluate ResNet-18 trained from scratch\". Why not train ResNet50 from scratch?\n\n- There are many typos, e.g., \"bset\", \"for tow reasons\", \"pseudo-labelign\", \"a relevant samples\", \"emply\". The paper needs to be polished for good readability."
