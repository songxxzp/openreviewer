                "value": "This paper proposed iGraphMix that addresses the irregularity and alignment issues of Input Mixup on node classification. Specifically, to address the two issues, iGraphMix does not only interpolate node features and labels but also aggregates the sampled neighboring nodes. Theoretical analysis of the generalization gap and related experiments on the real-world graphs showed that the proposed method is effective in regularizing GNNs by generating diverse virtual samples and preserving high usability and versatility."

In Section 5 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS, the author mentioned that \u201cCiteseer dataset contains only 1.71% connected edges of labeled nodes out of all edges\u201d, but the data \u201c1.71%\u201d lacks of related references.\n2. Considering iGraphMix that the essence of iGraphMix is to implement a mixed strategy for features, labels and adjacency matrix respectively, however, the experiment content lacks the ablation experiment for these three components. It would be better to add related ablation experiments to examine the effect of these three components."
