For example, for nearest neighbor search, running Lloyd's algorithm on the 10M vectors to generate ~12K clusters (also around 1.2M parameters, the same number) will lead to almost no empty clusters, and much better recall (3b, 3c) than either approach. However, it may also be more computationally expensive. Without documenting training time, the quality-compute tradeoff is not made clear.\n1. Weak results on nearest neighbor search. Comparison is only done against GNO-IMI, but at the 10M vector scale, it should be fairly easy to compare with many inverted index style data structures. Notably, FAISS/ScaNN both use k-means clustering, which would naturally fit onto Figure 3b. GNO-IMI is a weak baseline that should at best be used at larger scales when training costs must be kept to an absolute minimum. The paper also alternates between proposing tensor decomposition as an interesting proof of concept for nearest neighbors (if so, what future research or experiments must be done to see if this is truly a viable candidate for efficient nearest neighbor search?) and  as something that's already effective and should be used immediately (which this paper fails to convince me of).\n1. Figures 3e and 3f: PCA-projecting 96 dimensions onto two dimensions is not difficult, and even the most naive compression methods will result in something that looks similar once projected to two dimensions, so these plots aren't very significant.\n1. Figure 2 is confusing; for example, in 2a, why are there so few orange points on the left column, relative to 2b or 2c? Are the same points overlaid over the first two columns? What is the significance of the color differences in the last two columns?"

The idea is to reshape the Nxd (N vectors in d dims) sample data into (N=N1*N2*...*Nk)xd tensors and compute a tensor train decomposition with lower rank 3-dimensional tensors. That is the data matrix is approximated as G_1 G_2  G_{k-1} where G_i \\in R^{r_i x d x i} .  One could fix a prefix of this tensor train and collapse the suffix to find \"median\" representations of the data while smudging out outliers. A hierarchy of prefixes then would lead to a hierarchy of \"median\" representations. For ANNS, these could be a hierarchy of cluster centers that the data can be bucketed into (search is then a limited beam search over the tree). For OOD detection, a point cloud is compared to projection via Wasserstein distance. The paper then tries to optimize for approximate objectives and tune over parameters for the two problems.\n\nOn the ANN problem, results are compared with a strong clustering based technique called GNO-IMI. A two level hierarchy is chosen and the results closely track those of GNO-IMI."

If I understood correctly, then the authors are primarily interested in dealing with large datasets that do not fit in memory and therefore they are interested in aggressively compressing the data such that computation can be directly performed on the compressed TT representation.\n\nIn order to compute the tensor train decomposition, the authors have proposed using loss based on comparing distances between distributions (in terms of the Wasserstein distance). They claim that the hierarchical structure in the TT representation enables efficient approximate nearest neighbor search. The OOD detection task is evaluated on the MVTech anomaly detection benchmark where the method is compared with a coreset-based method. For the approximate nearest neighbor detection task, the proposed method is compared with an efficient ANN method proposed by Babenko and Lempitsky 2016."

The tensor train representation itself is well known and has been applied to many different applications involving high dimensional data. There exist several ways to construct such a representation. Section 2 and 3 appears to be a review of relevant known concepts, but the authors did not state clearly that they were reviewing these concepts. For example, Section 2 talks about the tensor train representation of high dimensional data without actually touching upon the crucial aspect of compression. Section 3 finally motivates that different row orders leads to different compression ratio but again I find the discussion a bit vague because it seems like a review of known ideas and insights. The introduction of the sliced Wasserstein loss in Section 3 is a bit abrupt in my opinion. It is unclear why this loss is being defined and why it should be minimized to find the TT parameters. If the main contribution was the introduction of this loss function, then the paper needs to be rewritten to justify why this loss should be used as opposed to the loss function that is conventionally used in existing work. \n\nWhen considering this as an applications paper, I have some serious concerns as well. Both OOD and ANN are well studied techniques and the baselines against which the proposed TT based approach is compared are not state-of-the-art in the two respective areas. Therefore, I am not convinced about the benefits of using the proposed TT decomposition-based approach to solve either of the two tasks. The experimental results appear to be more of a proof of concept that a TT decomposition-based approach could work for these two tasks. \n\nA few sentences from page 6 (pasted below), shows that the complete Deep1B dataset is not actually used in the ANN experimental evaluation, only a tiny fraction of it is actually used! However, when I checked the paper (Babenko and Lempitsky 2016), I see that the whole Deep1B dataset is used in most of their experiments. Thus, from what I can tell, the ANN results and comparison with G(NO)-IMI presented in this paper, is not a fair comparison, and it raises a serious concern about the practicality of the proposed methods. There are numerous, extremely well-studied, scalable hashing methods for high dimensional data (locality sensitive hashing, learned hashing, etc.) and a more convincing case needs to be made for why this method should be used for approximate nearest neighbor search, instead of such methods.\n\n\u201cWe conduct our experiments on the Deep1B Babenko & Lempitsky (2016) \u2013 dataset, that contains one billion 96-dimensional vectors, that was produced as an outputs from last fully-connected layer of ImageNet-pretrained GoogLeNet Szegedy et al. (2015) model, then compressed by PCA to 96 dimensions and l2-normalized. In our experiments we use only subset of size 10M vectors.\n\nWe build proof-of-concept ANN system based on TT point cloud, \u2026 \u201c"
