                "value": "This paper proposes an interesting agent called Suspicion-Agent that leverages GPT-4's knowledge and reasoning capabilities for imperfect information games. The key idea is to decompose the gameplay into modules like observation interpreter, planning, etc. and craft prompts to enable GPT-4 to understand the game states and make informed decisions. An interesting contribution is incorporating theory of mind (ToM) into the planning module to predict and influence the opponent's actions. The method is evaluated on games like Coup, Texas Hold'em, and Leduc Hold'em. Qualitative examples demonstrate generalization ability across different games with no specialized training. Quantitative experiments on Leduc Hold'em show Suspicion-Agent can outperform algorithms like CFR and NFSP. Ablation studies provide insights into the agent's adaptive strategies."

                "value": "While this article is interesting, I find the experimental results in the paper to be questionable, potentially leading readers to misunderstand the capabilities of the LLM in handling imperfect information games.\n\nThe author conducted experiments on two-player zero-sum imperfect information games (specifically, Leduc Hold\u2019em), with one of the comparative methods being CFR. The author claimed that Suspicion-Agent's performance significantly surpassed that of CFR, a statement that appears to be entirely unreliable and incorrect. \n\n*In two-player zero-sum games, following a Nash equilibrium strategy ensures that you will never lose in expectation.* Considering the simplest two-player zero-sum game of rock-paper-scissors, adopting the Nash equilibrium strategy (equal probability of choosing rock, scissors, or paper) ensures a non-negative expected payoff against any strategy. CFR stands as one of the most widely used algorithms for calculating Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games. Leduc Hold\u2019em is a rather small game, and CFR effortlessly identifies the Nash equilibrium for this game. Therefore, in theory, no algorithm can beat CFR in expectation in this game. The author's claim that Suspicion-Agent can beat CFR on Leduc Hold\u2019em is entirely incorrect from this theoretical perspective.\n\n\nThe author's experimental results can be explained in two possible ways: 1) The sample size of 100 games is relatively small. Poker games exhibit substantial randomness, and the outcomes from just 100 games possess a high degree of randomness, making them potentially unrepresentative of the AI's actual performance. A more extensive number of games would be necessary to accurately assess the AI's performance (though this might be cost-prohibitive, especially for Suspicion-Agent). 2) The CFR algorithm employed by the author might not have converged, resulting in strategies that significantly deviate from Nash equilibrium. In either scenario, it raises significant concerns regarding the current experimental results.\n\nHence, the author's claim that Suspicion-Agent can outperform traditional algorithms like CFR without specialized training or examples is regrettably incorrect. \nTo attain a level suitable for publication, this article necessitates substantial revisions. Consequently, I cannot recommend accepting this article in its current state."
