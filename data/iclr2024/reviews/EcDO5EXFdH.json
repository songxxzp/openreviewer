For examples, there exists a lot operators in the search space that results in non-differentiability. Meanwhile, the Hessian matrix being positive-definitive implies the objective function as convex at least while is non-convex for Deep learning. In addition for A2, the authors used $\\ell_1$-norm to bound point in a ball, which is wrong since the domain is not a ball at all under $\\ell_1$ norm. \n\n- Wording is a bit big. The paper is titled as information theory, yet I did not find a specific area that actually leverages it significantly, except the usage of Fisher information matrix, while is commonly used as an alternative to Hessian matrix in other literatures.\n\n- Theorem is not necessary for the proxy designs. I would expect that the theorem could indeed provide some novel insights to design some unique and innovative proxy. However, the present proxy seems quite standard for me that researchers should be able to design it out without deriving theorem under strong assumptions beforehand. \n\nDue to the above main reasons, I could not accept the paper at the moment, though the routine of using theorem to design algorithm is what I agree on."
