For example, just as humans may say, \"the thing I told you five minutes ago,\" EC agents should be able to refer to prior expressions as well.\n\nTo formalize this problem, the authors propose a metric, $M_{\\theta^n}$ for measuring how often a message corresponds to a previous operator, where $n$ specifies how many timesteps previous.\n\nThe authors further propose to increase the use of temporal expressions through changes in architecture and loss. A \"temporal module\" in the sender and receivers model temporal processing, and a temporal loss can explicitly guide the receiver temporal module.\n\nOverall, the authors find that neural architectures with the temporal modules use previous expressions far more often than baseline architectures."

Adding further RNN modules to the neural agents to represent temporal relations also seems clever (although I have important questions about the implementation, which I raise later).\n\n## Quality\nThe results from the work are strong, per the desired metrics of temporal references.\n\n## Clarity\nThe writing is largely clear, and the diagrams (both Fig 1 and 5, in the appendix) help explain the architectural changes. I think the authors did a very good job explaining simple aspects of LTL; I have some background in this area, and this seemed like a good presentation of necessary details.\n\n## Significance\nI quite like the combination of temporal logic methods with EC, and I think this is an interesting area for future research. The approach also seems simple (in a good way!), which should aid wider adoption of the ideas."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "## Clarity around actual approach/implementation\nMy biggest concern with this work is about understanding the actual approach the authors used for the neural implementation. Fundamentally, I do not understand how the authors order inputs over time and the structure of communication. I explain my question about this under \"Questions\" - generally, I view this uncertainty as a weakness given how central such details are to the paper. Certainly, I could be misunderstanding information presented in the paper, but I am very knowledgeable about EC, so I do not think I am missing something obvious.\n\nBecause of my uncertainty about this crucial part of the paper, I am currently leaning against acceptance. I emphasize, however, that if the authors clarify their approach and it seems sound, I am willing to revise my score.\n\n## Clarity around notation\nThe authors dedicate a fair amount of effort to establishing some notation based on LTL, but then do not seem to use it fully. For example, many of the figures (e.g., Figure 2) have almost natural-language y axis labels, whereas I would have expected a single mathematical symbol.\n\n## Clarity of examples\nThe authors included a few simple examples in the paper that I first found very helpful, but now I think they actually are misleading. For example, in Section 3.1, the authors write about an intuitive example where the target sequence is [1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1] and different message sequences are considered ([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 1], etc.). My problem with this example is that, when I read it, it made me think that the speakers only generated a single token per target. This was reinforced in Table 4 in Appendix B.1, where the same type of example appears. However, in Section 3.3., where actual results are presented, I realized that a single message was composed of multiple tokens (5 or 6). That is fine, I wish I had realized this earlier on.\n\n## Further metrics?\nThe authors mostly focus on the emergence of temporal references, but further metrics would help situate the broader network performance. Notably, the authors do evaluate validation set accuracy in Figure 6, and they show a small decrease in performance for temporal networks relative to non-temporal networks. This is good analysis but then makes me 1) worry about the utility of this approach, if accuracy goes down and 2) slightly contradicts some of the claims in the main paper, which motivate temporal references to improve performance. \n\n## Minor:\n1. Footnote 1 appears to indicate that the authors will share code upon acceptance. I suggest the authors use https://anonymous.4open.science/ in future submissions to link to anonymized code during the review phase.\n\n2. The figures in Appendix E are not very clear and should be cleaned up for publication. I would also strongly caution about interpreting tSNE plots as indicative of compositionality; do the authors have references supporting this link?\n\n3. The notation around equation 2 is not right. In particular, typically I read the right text in case-based equations as specifying the conditions under which that behavior is selected. I think the cases should just be $c < 0.5$ and $c >= 0.5$, therefore, without any of the $x$ parts. \n\n4. Equation 3 seems to have a few things off about it. First, \"objectRepeated\" seems misleading as a name. I believe it just returns true if $x_n$ is present $h_v$ episodes ago, correct? What does that have to do with repetition? Second, the variable $n$ is very overloaded in the expression, which impedes readbility. It is simulatenously used to represent a fixed number of previous timestep (see left side of the equation) and is used as a counter variable (see right side of the equation)."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. My main question, which I hope the authors address in their rebuttal, is about better understanding the exact form of the inputs and outputs of the speaker network. The key idea of this paper is that speakers should be able to refer back to previous communication if they see similar inputs. Thus, the speaker must somehow see a series of inputs, right? How is that represented? Is it a batch of inputs? I'm guessing that is the case, because the temporal module in the speaker reshapes the inputs based on batch size, so that makes me think it allows the temporal module to represent at which point in \"time\" an input appears. If it is the case, however, that the temporal order of inputs is represented by position in the batch, I am somewhat disappointed in the baselines used for comparison. It seems obvious non-temporal networks, which observe inputs in parallel over a batch, cannot represent temporal relations.\n\nOverall, I am unsure about what the authors are actually doing to represent sequentially-ordered inputs, though, and really need clarity on this topic to evaluate this paper.\n\n2. In the main paper, the authors typically present results for $h_v = 4$, but the authors mentioned that they conducted experiments for other. Results for such values are included in Appendix F, but the results end up raising lots of questions for me. Can the authors comment as to why results are seemingly so bimodal? Everything for $h_v <=4$ matches one profile, and everything for $h_v > 4$ matches another. Also, what was the actual training setup for these results?"

Here are the ones that I have spotted: (1) a vector in this paper sometimes means the feature vector of a target and sometimes a target sequence. Both of them can have arbitrary lengths and often appear without further explanation. (2) things like x \\in V are not conditions in equation 2, IMO, they should not connected with the \"real\" conditions with AND. Also, see my questions below. \n2. The paper spends quite a lot of space describing the details of the agents (e.g., the dimension of each vector during the implementation). Contrary to this is the absence of motivations for many choices made in the current study. For example, why the environment was defined in this way? Why a second LSTM in both sender and receiver? Why does there have to be an additional LSTM to capture temporal information? Actually, in terms of the architectural design, the two additional LSTMs in the sender and receiver have very different roles as the two LSTMs in the sender are parallel, and the two in the receiver are stacked. \n3. Related to my second concern, the experiment design in the present study also cannot validate the rationalities of these choices. This makes the conclusions from the experiments, namely a different batching strategy is sufficient, look narrow.\n\n### Typos:\n- Page 3: c \\leq 0.5 -> c < 0.5\n- Page 6: When you are saying Temporal Loss, I believe you meant temporal prediction loss rather than temporal loss."

Furthermore, a loss function for temporal object classification is introduced to encourage the emergence of temporal encoding. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, an evaluation metric is devised to measure the frequency of using the same message to describe previously presented objects.

It leverages the sequential position of objects within the batch as a means of encoding temporal information, thereby modifying traditional referential games and their associated training frameworks.\n\n2. The paper demonstrates a comprehensive design of the experiments. It encompasses various modifications to modeling architectures, incorporates multiple environments, and also analyzes different statistical results."

Example demonstration: the authors present multiple examples using integer arrays in the game design (section 2.3), agent architecture (figure 1), how to compute the temporality metric (section 3.1), as well as the sent messages (section 3.3), which I believe are of different meanings. However, using integer arrays in all the examples can make the demonstration more confusing. Different symbols used in different cases would be better. For example, objects as names, and messages using alphabets.\n\n2. Experimental analysis clarification:\n\n    a. In section 3.3, it is said \u201conly networks that have the sequential LSTM are capable of producing temporal references\u201d: From Figure 2a, we can observe all networks have cases \u201creaching % used as previous\u201d above 80%. A clarification on how you make a judgment on \u201cproducing temporal references\u201d should be made. \n\n    b. In Figure 3b, only the results of Temporal networks are presented because \u201cnon-temporal networks learn no temporally specialised messages\u201d. The threshold and significance between temporally and no temporally specialised messages should be made clear as well. \n\n    c. Through Figure 3a, the claim that \u201cthese messages could be a more efficient way of describing objects\u201d needs to be further clarified. \n\n    d. In Figure 2, which of the six environments used for the legends about \u201ctrained RGs\u201d and \u201cTRGs\u201d are not specified. \n\n    e. During the experiment analysis, the results of \u201cNever same\u201d are not presented. Also, there is not much difference, or the difference is not underscored between \u201cenvironment\u201d and \u201cenvironment Hard\u201d. This part could be better organized based on the analysis needed."

                "value": "1. For the temporal loss, I assume it is a categorical classification about the last position the object shows up. I think it could be misleading when trained with target object classification together. There are some circumstances when the objects are the same but the temporal labels are different, which may cause the network to be confused. Have you tried to add a smaller weight to the temporal loss or try to add this loss on top of the temporal LSTM?\n\n2. More analysis of the features that the temporal LSTM provides would be helpful to demonstrate its vital role."
