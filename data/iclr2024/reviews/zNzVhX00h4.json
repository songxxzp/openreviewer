Under mild overparameterization, Theorem 5 in Section 3 shows that almost all activation regions have the property that every differentiable critical point of the training loss (with nonzero 2nd layer weights) is a global minimum; i.e., \"no bad local minima\" holds for most regions.\n\n2. However, not all activation regions are non-empty (i.e., the inequalities defining the region are feasible). Section 4 studies the number of non-empty activation regions. For the high-dim case of $d \\geq n$, for data points in general position, Theorem 5 can be extended to \"almost all *non-empty* activation regions\" (Corollary 8)\n\n3. The paper then discusses the case of one-dimensional input + bias, in which stronger statements can be shown. The authors show in Theorem 10 that almost all non-empty activation regions satisfy the \"no bad local minima\" property. Under a stronger assumption on the 2nd layer weights, Theorem 12 shows existence of an affine set of global minima in almost all non-empty activation regions.\n\n4.

Hence, given an activation region, the prediction $F$ is linear in $W$, which makes the Jacobian matrix constant in the region and it makes proofs much easier. For Sections 5-6, the authors show results specialized to one-dimensional input space. I question if these proof techniques could be extended to deeper networks and higher-dimensional input space.\n\nW2. The paper only considers differentiable local minima, which misses the possible existence of non-differentiable local minima. In fact, Laurent & von Brecht (2018) show that in the hinge loss case, local minima can only occur at the non-differentiable boundaries except for flat regions. Is there any hope of including non-differentiable points into the analysis?\n\nW3. Most results in the paper only prove that for most activation regions, \"all critical points are global minima\". If we take a closer look at it, the theorems do not talk about the existence of critical points in these regions; they may or may not exist. Therefore, the statements cannot rule out the following pathological scenario: critical points do not exist at all in the $1-\\epsilon$ fraction of the linear regions and the $\\epsilon$ fraction of the regions contain bad local minima. In order to make the results stronger, a more complete characterization of the existence of critical points should be helpful.\n\nW4. Some directly relevant citations are missing. [A, B, C] show the existence of bad local minima in ReLU networks and thus are directly relevant. [D] and some other papers by the same authors also consider the partition of parameter space with respect to the sign of pre-activations. I feel there should be more missing relevant papers, so please consider reviewing the literature again and updating the paper accordingly. Lastly, the citation to Safran & Shamir (2016) in page 1 should be corrected to Safran & Shamir (2018).\n\n[A] Small nonlinearities in activation functions create bad local minima in neural networks\n\n[B] Piecewise linear activations substantially shape the loss surfaces of neural networks\n\n[C] Truth or Backpropaganda?
