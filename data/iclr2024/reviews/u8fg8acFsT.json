                "value": "The paper under review proposes a new approach named Proximal Preference Optimization for Diffusion Models (PPOD) to optimize the fine-tuning process in reinforcement learning with AI feedback. The proposed approach extends prior work on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by applying it to diffusion models often used in image-generative applications. The method involves the use of proximal constraints to meet optimization challenges that have been encountered when working with diffusion models. In comparison to existing optimization methods that largely rely on the use of reward optimization, PPOD focuses on preference optimization that is both stable and feasible within a supervised learning environment. The performance of PPOD was evaluated against other RL-based reward optimization approaches, leading to more impressive outcomes when applied to the stable diffusion model."

I understand that this is a follow-up work from DPOK, but please consider explaining it clearly.\n- How did you sample from a diffusion policy?\n- Where did you get the $\\pi_{ref}$ from? Is it a stable diffusion model defined under the diffusion policy?\n- If no RL is involved, maybe you don't have to define a diffusion policy and compute the logits from a policy altogether. You can compute the exact likelihood of an image by integrating the ODE. Can you show a comparison between the two methods?\n- In DPO, you can get the exact likelihood of generating a sequence from the autoregressive policy given it is well-defined, so we can be sure that the DPO is optimizing for the correct objective.

                "value": "- In Section 3.2, the authors state: \"Different from the language modeling, the KL divergence for diffusion models needs to regularize the whole denoising process between the finetuned and reference policies.\" This seems like a significant design decision that requires some explanation and justification. As a result of this decision, Equation (3) does not actually match the standard RLHF setup, due to the discrepancy between $\\pi(\\mathbf x_0 \\mid \\mathbf c)$ in the first term and $\\pi(\\mathbf x_{0:T} \\mid \\mathbf c)$ in the KL term.\n- On a related note, the usage of a \"policy\" $\\pi$ throughout the section is a bit confusing since it switches between $\\pi(\\mathbf x_0 \\mid \\mathbf c)$ and $\\pi(\\mathbf x_{0:T} \\mid \\mathbf c)$; furthermore, neither of these match the actual MDP policy defined in the referenced works DPOK and DDPO, which is $\\pi(\\mathbf x_{t-1} \\mid \\mathbf x_t, \\mathbf c)$.\n- Also related: this discrepancy between $\\pi(\\mathbf x_0 \\mid \\mathbf c)$ and $\\pi(\\mathbf x_{0:T} \\mid \\mathbf c)$ somewhat breaks the connection to DPO and its corresponding theoretical guarantees. Since the \"policy\" is considered to be $\\pi(\\mathbf x_{0:T} \\mid \\mathbf c)$ in the KL penalty, in order to match the DPO derivation, the ground-truth reward function must also be considered to operate on tuples $r(\\mathbf x_{0:T}, \\mathbf c)$. However, in reality, the reward function only depends on the final sample $\\mathbf x_0$. Not sure what the downstream effects of this discrepancy would be, but it should be addressed by the authors.\n- Algorithm 1 is quite confusing. For example, on the 3rd line, the reader must infer that the images are being sampled from the current model being optimized rather than $\\pi_\\text{ref}$. The explanation below it of offline vs. online learning is also quite confusing. This section could overall use some clarification, expansion, and introduction of more precise notation.\n- The paper really emphasizes the term \"RLAIF\" throughout. Calling the method RLAIF seems a bit silly -- although there's no widely-accepted definition of \"RLAIF\", and I usually don't think quibbling over semantics is very productive, the fact that ImageReward is learned directly from human preferences means that using it as a reward model is not at all different from the \"standard\" RLHF setup. The authors also point out that their method is specifically *not* RL -- although that is also debatable, especially for the version where they perform multiple iterations of online improvement.\n- The experiments are overall unconvincing. First, they only cover 4 prompts, and the model is optimized on a single prompt at a time. This severely limits practical applicability. Second, the primary comparison in Figure 3 does not really show a significant difference between DPOK and PPOD -- the small difference could be easily attributed to hyperparameter tuning. On top of that, it is well-known that reward functions (especially learned ones) are easily exploitable, and just because a method produces high-reward samples does not mean that those samples are desirable. Without any qualitative examples of the baselines, it is impossible to tell if the higher-reward samples from PPOD are actually better than the corresponding samples from DPOK. Third, the paper is severely lacking in hyperparameters and training details.\n- One of the primary benefits of DPO is that it skips learning a reward model and learns directly from preference annotations instead. Using a learned reward model -- ImageReward -- as a preference annotator nullifies this benefit. PPOD is essentially doing RLHF, but adds an extra step of using the reward model to produce pairwise preference annotations and then uses those to optimize the model with the DPO objective. It is still possible that the DPO formulation improves optimization ability -- the DPO paper finds that their method can beat PPO even when PPO has access to the ground-truth rewards that generated the preference dataset. However, the authors do not make this the clear narrative of their paper.\n\nMinor mistakes:\n- Section 2: \"clapping the gradient\" instead of \"clipping the gradient\"\n- Section 2: \"The learning efficiency is not well optimized since they all required to build a reward model from the preference data.\" The works being referred to -- Black et. al. (2023) and Fan et. al. (2023) -- introduce generic RL algorithms that do not necessarily need to learn from preference data. In fact, none of the reward functions tested in Black et. al. (2023) are derived from pairwise preference data.\n- Section 3.1: Define $\\beta_t$ and $\\sigma_t$.\n- Algorithm 1: Inconsistency between superscript and subscript for $k$.\n- Section 4.2: It is not mentioned whether it is the online or offline version of PPOD that is being reported in Figure 3.\n- Table 1 should go before the references."

However, in Section 4.2, they say that \"The scores of SFT and DPOK are obtained from the DPOK paper\".
