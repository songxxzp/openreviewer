                "value": "This paper designs a new data poisoning attack tailored for fair representation learning. The key idea is to generate poisoning samples that maximizes the mutual information between the representation (of the poisoned sample) and the sensitive attribute. This can be solved by bi-level optimization, yet the outer level problem (estimating high-dimensional mutual information) is intractable. To solve this issue, the authors propose to use Fisher\u2019s linear discriminant (FLD) score as a cheap proxy to MI, which has a closed-form solution. For inner level problem, it is solved by matching the gradients of a victim model and a clean model. Through the approximations made, the original objective is now fully tractable and can be learned by SGD. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on two tabular datasets."

This framework, to the best of my knowledge, is new within the specific context considered and is very-well motivated. The reminder on the advantage of MI-based fairness as compared to conventional metric (e.g. DP) is also useful;\n- **Cheap proxy to mutual information**: I also like the authors\u2019 idea to use Fisher\u2019s linear discriminant analysis (FLD) as a cheap-but-still-effective proxy to MI. I would also highly praise the authors\u2019 efforts to mention the possibilities of other analytic proxies, as well as a discussing between FLD and these alternative methods. \n- **Feature selection for fairness**: in addition to the main contribution, the authors also show how their developed attack can be further applied to identify robust features for fair classification. This is quite interesting, especially in that it offers a new perspective for understanding and interpreting the behavior of a fairly trained model. I personally think this part deserves a separate section and can be highlighted as a 2nd main contribution of the paper."

                "value": "- **On the necessity of working at representation level**. After reading the paper, it is still unclear to me why do we need to consider I(Z; a) rather than I(Y(X); a). Here Y(X) is the prediction of the model. In fact, considering I(Y(X); a) has several benefits: first, its maximization still yields an unfair model; second, its estimation is much easier due to the low-dimensionality of Y(X) and a (for example, we can estimate it easily by the well-known KSG estimator [1] which typically works quite well in low-dimensional cases). Importantly, maximizing I(Y(X); a) also do not require an access to Y. Can the authors justify the reason behind considering I(Z; a) instead?\n\n- **Issues in the discussion related to other MI proxies**: some comments in remark 2.1 do not seem completely sensible to me. For example, the author mention that other analytical proxies like (K)CCA and sliced mutual information suffer from differentiation difficulties. This may not be true in my view (for example, in CCA, you can first solve the optimal weights analytically, then substitute it back to the formula of CCA. The resultant formula has a structure very similar to eq2 in your paper). In addition, I think the authors miss the possibility of using non-parametric dependence measure e.g. distance correlation (dCorr) [2]. This is also fully analytical and may potentially be applicable in your scenario. Ultimately, I think the real advantage of your FLD-based method is it provably optimises a variational lower bound of MI, whereas other proxies (KCCA, slice MI, dCorr) may not. This seems to be a better justification of the use of your method. \n\n- **Slightly limited evaluation**: most of the evaluations in this work are conducted on tabular data where the network size is small. Whether the method developed in this work will scale to larger networks e.g. those in computer vision and NLP remain unclear to me. However, given the nature of many existing literature in fairness research, which also only focus on tabular data, this should not be a main criticism for the paper.\n\n[1] Estimating mutual information, Physical Review E, 2004\n\n[2] Measuring and testing dependence by correlation of distances, Annals of Statistics, 2007\n\n----------------------------------------------\nUpdate after rebuttal:\n\nThe authors have addressed most of my concern above and I have updated my score to 8 accordingly."

However directly maximising mutual information of high-dimensional embeddings is very difficult. I know there are some differentiable approximation tool to MI, like MINE. But it is computationally costly and prone to the potential estimation gap. It is interesting to read the theoretical analysis and practices of using Fisher Linear Discriminator scores to bound MI. Apparently, optimising FLD scores is much easier and economic in computation. \n\n3/ Inspired from Geiping et al's gradient matching work, this study propoes to matching the upper and lower bound of gradients instead of solving the bi-level poisoning problem.

                "value": "The authors propose a poisoning attack strategy to compromise fair representation learning, aiming to increase the fairness gap for underprivileged groups. The attack relies on approximations to solve a bilevel optimization problem where the outer problem, which describes the attacker\u2019s objective, aims to maximize the mutual information between the representation for the privileged and the underprivileged groups. Since the optimization of this objective is not tractable, the authors use Fisher\u2019s Linear Discriminant (FLD) score as a proxy. Then, the whole bilevel optimization problem is approximated using a gradient matching strategy. The authors also provide some theoretical analysis on the poisoning ration required to compromise the target models."

                "value": "+ Poisoning fair representations have received less attention in the research literature on data poisoning and preliminary works show that these attacks can have a significant impact on the fairness of the target algorithms. Exploring more scalable poisoning attack strategies capable of increasing the fairness gap for deep neural networks is timely and a topic of interest. \n\n+ The authors strived to provide a theoretical analysis on the ratio of poisoning points required to compromise the target algorithms."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "+ The paper lacks a clear threat model. For example, it is unclear whether the attacker\u2019s objective is useful for compromising algorithms with and without mechanisms for mitigating the fairness gap. On the other side, it is unclear what is the attacker\u2019s objective and the relation of the attack strategy with respect to the model\u2019s performance. Other works in the research literature, like Chang et al. or Van et al. (\u201cPoisoning Attacks in Fair Machine Learning\u201d) have already considered the trade-off between targeting performance and the fairness gap. \n\n+ In the end the attack proposed by the authors rely on the maximization of the FLD score in the outer optimization objective. This relies on strong assumptions on the distribution of the data and its representation and may not hold for many practical scenarios. In this sense, it is unclear why this strategy is better compared to other attacks already proposed in the research literature, like Solans et al., Mehrabi et al., Chang et al., or Van et al. (\u201cPoisoning Attacks in Fair Machine Learning\u201d), which have strong connections to this work. On the other side, there is not mention to \u201cSubpopulation Poisoning Attacks\u201d by Jagielski et al., which are also very relevant to this work and proposes more scalable alternatives for crafting poisoning attacks targeting fairness. \n\n+ Given the existing works in the research literature, I believe it is to bold that the authors claim that \u201cWe propose the first data poisoning attack on FRL as outlined in Figure 1.\u201d I think that the authors should clarify this and position better their paper and contributions with respect to other existing works. \n\n+ The experimental evaluation is not convincing: In the experiments the authors just reported results evaluating the BCE loss but did not consider any of the existing metrics for measuring the fairness gap. On the other hand, there is not mention to how the attack affects the accuracy at all. Apart from that, it is necessary a more comprehensive comparison with other methods in the research literature, e.g., Solans et al., Chang et al. Van et al. (\u201cPoisoning Attacks in Fair Machine Learning\u201d), Jagileski et al. (\u201cSubpopulation Poisoning Attacks\u201d). For some of these attacks, the authors can use the same outer objective and use the same approximation for solving the bilevel optimization problem. \n\n+ The authors used a gradient matching strategy for approximating the solution of the bilevel optimization problem. However, Jagielski et al. (\u201cSubpopulation Poisoning Attacks\u201d) shows that other strategies can be more efficient for this. I think this aspect requires further analysis. \n\n+ The authors say: \u201cHeuristics such as label flipping (Mehrabi et al., 2021) lack a direct connection to the attack goal, thereby having no success guarantee and often performing unsatisfactorily.\u201d I think this is not true. Although more limited on the attacker\u2019s capabilities, smart manipulation of the labels can lead to successful attacks. See for example \u201cSubpopulation Poisoning Attacks\u201d by Jagielski et al."

                "value": "+ Equation (2) relies on strong assumptions about the distribution (Gaussian distribution and continuous variables) of the different subpopulations. How is this a good proxy for approximating the original problem? How does this compare with existing attacks (as the ones mentioned before)?\n\n+ Could the authors provide more details on the threat model (see comments above)?\n\n+ How assumption 2 works in the current threat model for the attack? The authors say: \u201cBefore the attack, the victim is well trained.\u201d What does this mean?\n\n+ Also, for the theoretical analysis: Why do the authors think that assumption 3 is reasonable?"
