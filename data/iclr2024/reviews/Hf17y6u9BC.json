They study and compare the selection of the hyperparameters, evaluation metrics and input corruption techniques for activation patching based model interpretability. The paper studies two approaches, Gaussian Noise (GN) and Semantic Token Replacement (STR), for corrupting the inputs. Based on those studies the paper recommends using STR input corruption technique since it produces in-distribution samples as opposed to the GN approach which produces OOD samples. In terms of the evaluation metrics, it recommends logit difference since it is more granular and allows to detect model activations (components) that have negative impact on model performance."

Specifically, they look at two ways to add corruption to a token embedding: gaussian noise (adding noise to the embedding) or symmetric token replacement (replacing a token with a semantically related token). They find that gaussian noise can cause the input to be OOD, thus breaking the internal mechanism. When looking at logit difference vs. probability, they find that probability can overlook negative model components. Finally they look at sliding window patching, and find that it can inflate logit plots."

To be of most relevance to the community, it would be great if the authors suggested an approach that had the flexibility of gaussian noise without introducing as much bias.\n\nClarity: Table 1 and in particular the part about negative detection was a bit hard to parse.

Specifically, the paper scrutinizes two methodologies for generating corrupted prompts: 1) Gaussian Noising (GN) and 2) Symmetric Token Replacement (STR). Furthermore, it explores two evaluation metrics: 1) probability and 2) logit difference, alongside investigating the impact of sliding window patching."
