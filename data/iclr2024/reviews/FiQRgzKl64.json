This will ensure that scores are reproducible and do not vary across papers by up to 1.8 BLEU points due to varying tokenization and normalization, see **[2]**, **[4]**.

The combination of experts is handled by the router. Given that all operations appear to be linear, can the router not directly generate the weights?\n\n2. The use of the experts allows the amount of weight sharing between candidate linear operations to be tempered. One architecture may use one set of weights and another can use a completely separate set, or a linear combination of the expert weights. Setting the weights to be completely decoupled (disentangled) would revert the approach to the traditional weight sharing approaches such as in ENAS. Please could the authors explain why a completely disentangled ablation is not performed (m=number of layers). Also can the authors provde an ablation for m=1, i.e. weights fully entangled?\n\n3. The focus of the paper is on removing the need for from-scratch training of the final architecture. However the purpose of training the supernet is generally to find the optimal architecture, not to find optimal weights. Would stopping the supernet training earlier save more time?\n\n4. Explanation of neuron-wise MoS needs a better explanation. Elements of its explanation should be in the earlier section on layer-wise MoS, such as the introduction of m value as the number of experts. Making Fig 1 less busy would help with this.\n\n5. Can the authors explain why the final architecture performs better for having being trained via their method? Is it because the architecture found is better or because the final model's performance is improved by having a better weight initialisation?"

To fully evaluate the method's applicability, incorporating a broader range of network sizes and model families (e.g., BERT, T5, GPT) would be beneficial for assessing its scalability and generalizability.\n\n2. The absence of FLOPs (Floating Point Operations Per Second) as a performance metric is noticeable. Including FLOPs would provide a more complete comparison with other methods. Additionally, the exclusion of the STS-B task, a single regression task in the GLUE benchmark, is not justified; its inclusion could enhance the validation of task generalization.\n\n3. Although efficiency is purported to be a key advantage of the proposed method, this is not thoroughly discussed in the main body of the paper. The supplementary comparison of memory efficiency between HAT and the proposed method indicates a significant memory efficiency gap. Moreover, the improvements in task performance are relatively marginal  and efficiency drop compared to other baselines is significant, suggesting a trade-off that may undermine the method's relative advantage when considering the marginal performance enhancement."
