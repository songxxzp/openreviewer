The main technical novelty is in proposing the baseline regularization. However, the main experiment on learning humanoid posing tasks does not use this regularization at all. As such, it appears that the used approach in these experiments is identical to those proposed in prior work (Mahmoudieh et al), just applied on a different task.\n\nIn the same vein, the paper is lacking any comparison to prior work. This may be because the method is identical to prior work, just applied on a different domain? I do think it is valuable to show that CLIP-based rewards can work 0-shot in more challenging domains, but without technical novelty this contribution seems insufficient to warrant acceptance.\n\nFigure 4 shows that the proposed technical novelty of the baseline normalization does improve EPIC distance between the learned and a human-provided reward function. However, the paper lacks evidence that this improvement in EPIC distance indeed translates in an improvement in policy performance once trained on the reward function (the performed evaluation is a single step function from 0% to 100% success, so it's not informative enough to show good correlation, an environment with a more finegrained reward function may be required).\n\nA minor weakness is, that the experiments were performed in a clean, simulated environment, without distractors or other moving objects. Thus it is unclear whether the reward functions would be robust to such distractors (though admittedly prior works also did not evaluate realistic scenes).\n\nFinally, albeit impressive, the experiments are only performed on one non-toy environment (the humanoid). So even if the authors demonstrated that the proposed baseline regularization helps to improve policy performance, it would be good to add evaluations on at least a second non-toy environment, e.g. a robotic manipulation task, to prove that the effects are consistent."

No comparisons to baselines are performed and the introduced algorithmic changes are not used in the experiments. As such, I do not recommend acceptance of the paper in it's current form. I do think the paper has potential and I encourage the authors to\n- add experimental results that demonstrate that the proposed baseline regularization leads to improved policy performance\n- add experiments on at least one additional non-toy domain, e.g. a robotic manipulation task\n- demonstrate experimentally the correlation between the offline EPIC reward distance metric and policy performance once trained on the reward function\n\n# Post-Rebuttal Comments\n\nThank you for answering my review!\nI want to emphasize that I do not devalue empirical works in any way -- there are lots of examples for very high impact empirical works that shed light on shortcomings of the existing literature and provide practical implementation advice to \"make things work\".\n\nThe critical elements for such papers are that they provide technical \"tricks\" that are specific to the core algorithm yet demonstrate that they help across a wide range of applications of this algorithm (ie are not overfit to one task / environment etc.).\n\nBased the on the rebuttal the paper claims three main \u201ctricks\u201d to make things work:\n   - (1) model size \u2014> this one makes sense and is validated with experiments\n   - (2) reward formulation \u2014> this one is not validated experimentally\n   - (3) choice of RL optimizer algorithm \u2014> this one seems orthogonal to the core question of how to formulate reward functions and is also not experimentally validated\n\nFurther, I reiterate my concern that all experiments are conducted in a single non-toy environment \u2014 this is in my opinion insufficient to claim that the paper introduces \u201ca general way to make CLIP-rewards work\u201d.\n\nIf the main scope of the paper should be \u201ctricks to make CLIP-rewards work\u201d, the writing would need to change substantially, the experimental evaluations mentioned above would need to be added and more non-toy enviornments would need to be evaluated.\n\nFinally, it remains confusing that the main technical contribution is not used in the main experimental evaluation and the rebuttal did not provide a convincing reason for this.\n\nThus, in summary I do not see my concerns addressed by the rebuttal and maintain my score."

In its simplest form, a single sentence text prompt is passed to a CLIP model along with the pixel observation of the agent to produce a score that translates to the reward. A more sophisticated method is also proposed, labelled goal-baseline regularisation, with the intention of removing irrelevant information about the environment from the observation embedding. Specifically, it involves projecting the observation embedding on to the the line spanned by the task embedding and a baseline embedding, the latter of which originates from a generic description of the environment. The CLIP alignment is then calculated using an interpolation of the original observation embedding and the projection embedding. The approach is validated in the context of two simpler task, CartPole and MountainCar, as well as more complex ones in the Humanoid environment. For the first two, it is shown that the CLIP-induced reward aligns well with the ground-truth reward (which is not provided to the agent) and that agents trained with the former can learn to perform well in the initial task. In the Humanoid environment, agents are trained on complex tasks with no available ground-truth reward, and are shown to perform well in most tasks as judged by a human evaluation. It is shown that modifying the backgrounds and textures of the visual observations to make them more realistic can have a large effect on the success of agents. Furthermore, scaling experiments are run that demonstrate that using more powerful VLMs leads to better agent performance."

                "value": "This paper proposes the VLM-RM method, which uses a pre-trained CLIP model as a reward for training vision-based agents. VLM-RM models the reward as the alignment between a language instruction specifying the task and the current observation image while regularizing relative to a baseline prompt to remove irrelevant information from the reward. VLM-RM is empirically validated in classic control tasks and reaching various poses in MuJoCo."

                "value": "- The proposed VLM-RM method is simple and works well. VLM-RM provides a way to use CLIP models easily as a zero-shot reward signal from text without having to finetune the CLIP model. Furthermore, the prompts used for the reward model in VLM-RM are simple and intuitive, highlighting the ease of applying VLM-RM.\n- The experiments show the applicability of VLM-RM. In CartPole and MountainCar, the CLIP reward predictions align with the true success state, and we see the goal-baseline regularization helping for MountainCar. VLM-RM is also able to learn a variety of behaviors in the high-dimensional humanoid task. While the success of the humanoid experiments was evaluated by just one of the authors, the videos on the website convincingly show the correct behaviors.\n- The work clearly explores the limitation of VLM-RM that the environments should be visually realistic for CLIP to provide a meaningful learning signal. In MountainCar, realism produces better alignment between CLIP and the true success state (Fig. 2c). In Fig. 3, we see the impact of modified textures and the camera placement on performance. I believe the limitation around the realism of the observations is more a limitation of the environments rather than VLM-RM. \n- The work shows evidence that VLM-RM scales to better performance with larger, more capable CLIP models. Fig. 4, shows the humanoid kneeling task is only possible with the largest CLIP model."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The paper states that the \"CLIP rewards are only meaningful and well-shaped for environments that are photorealistic enough for the CLIP visual encoder to interpret correctly,\" yet the paper focuses on control environments without realistic visuals. Why not instead focus on more visually realistic simulation benchmarks and not have to modify the environment to make the rendering more realistic to fit the algorithm? \n- It's unclear if the goal-baseline regularization is necessary. The primary experiments in Table 1 don't use any goal-baseline regularization. The analysis in Fig. 4a shows the maximum or minimum amount of goal regularization to be best. Additionally, to what degree can the same effects of the goal-baseline regularization be incorporated in the goal prompt? A more detailed goal prompt can just specify to ignore the irrelevant information. \n- While the paper shows the strong final results of VLM-RM, the RL training stability of VLM-RM is unclear. Is it easy for RL methods to learn from the VLM-RM reward? How does this compare to a ground truth reward? See my further comments under the questions section."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- What exact values are selected for $\\alpha$ in Fig. 4a? I recommend putting an indicator in this plot to show which values are used. \n- What is the optional context $c$ in Eq. 1 used for? I don't see it referred to later in the paper.\n- Can the paper include the RL learning curves for all the experiments showing the number of samples versus either the predicted CLIP return or a ground truth metric, like true reward in the classic control tasks or EPIC in the humanoid tasks? Given there is a ground truth reward in the classic control tasks, can the authors also include that as a reference for the VLM-RM learning curves? It is important to see the training stability and efficiency under the CLIP model reward."
