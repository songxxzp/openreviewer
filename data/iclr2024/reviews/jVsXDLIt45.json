                "value": "This paper extends the Nugget approach [Qin, Durme, '23] from encoder-decoder architectures to decoder only architectures and explores its applications to compression of context in auto-encoding, auto-regressive decoding and downstream tasks like QA and summarization.\nIn all applications, the context to be compressed is encoded by a Nugget2D encoder, which seems to be a vanilla transformer encoder (initialized by some Llama variant LLM). The encodings are passed through a scorer and embeddings from the top-k scores are selected (similar to the original Nugget paper). Finally a separate LM (again initialized using some Llama variant LLM) operates on the actual task, encodes prompt/question and decodes the answer. This LM is trained to attend to only the selected nugget encodings. To easily propagate gradients to the scorer, during this attention mechanism between LM and nugget encoder, the scores are added to the attention logits (similar to the original nugget paper). The LM, nugget encoder and scorer are finetuned using PEFT.\nThe paper demonstrates that on the task of auto-encoding, Nugget2D outperforms ICAE, which allocates fixed size memory for compression, on the auto-regressive LM task, Nugget2D outperforms \"Compressive\" baseline, which pools the embeddings of context divided into constant sized chunks. On the QA task, their model retains 90% of the performance of an uncompressed baseline at 5x compression. Interestingly on the summarization task, their model outperforms baseline without an compression."

(2) (3) (4), are $\\mathbf{x}_i^l$ computed using $\\phi$ but not $\\theta$? \n- How does Qin and Van Durme (2023) train the Scorer? You should also add the explanation to 2.1 Background.\n- You mention in footnote 4 that Scorer quickly converges, and then $s_j$ can be removed from Eq. (5). How do you decide when to remove it? Do you first train all trainable parameters (based on the task) with $s_j$, and then just continue to still train all trainable parameters without $s_j$? Removing $s_j$ will cause all activations to change suddenly; not sure if it's a problem.\n- In Sec. 2.5, can you clarify how you pick $\\tau$?\n- Can you provide analysis about how much space are used by the extra model parameters when you introduce NUGGET2D?  I notice that $\\phi$ and $\\theta$ are not tied.\n- The nugget tokens are picked based on $\\phi$ but not $\\theta$. Is it possible that some tokens' contextualized representations according to $\\theta$ has much information but is not selected based on $\\phi$?\n- First paragraph on page 5 is confusing, e.g., you said $\\theta$ in eq (11) but there's no $\\theta$ in eq (11). Please clarify what re-assignment means with more understandable notations.\n- Is it true that the model only processes $w_r+w_d$ tokens and ignore the beginning tokens if the context is long? Would it be helpful if, like in many long-context processing papers, you still have some \"gist\" tokens to summarize the beginning tokens?"
