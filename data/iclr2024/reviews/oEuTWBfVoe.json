It is widely accepted that backpropagation is biologically implausible.\n\n* Regarding the following sentence in Section 3 \"We further define a readout ... ,i.e., $\\mathbf{m}^t = f(y^t).$\", did you mean to write $\\mathbf{m}^t = f(\\mathbf{y}^t)$ ($\\mathbf{y}^t$ with boldsymbol)?\n\n* On page 4, \"setting $\\theta_{110} = 1$ and $\\theta_{012} = -1$,\" the second term should be $\\theta_{021}$ rather than $\\theta_{012}$.\n\n* The initialization of polynomial coefficient parameters is not clear, and it seems they are initialized close to zero according to  Figure 2. It would be valuable to explain how they were initialized.\n\n* The paper models synaptic plasticity rules only for feedforward connections. It would be interesting to explore the impact of lateral connections (by adding additional terms in Equation 6). Have you experimented with such a setup?\n\n* In page 7, the authors state that \"In the case of the MLP, we tested various architectures and highlight results for a 3-10-1 neuron topology.\" What are the results for other various architectures? Putting them into the paper would also be valuable (as ablation studies). \n\n* The hyperparameters for the experiments are missing? What is the learning rate, what is the optimizer, etc.?\n\n* I do not see that much difference between the experiment presented in Section 4 and the experiment in (Confavreux et al., 2020) (Section 3.1) except the choice of optimization method. In your experimental setup, you also do not model the global reward. Therefore, I think it makes it more similar to the experiment in (Confavreux et al., 2020). \n\n* Comparison to previous work is missing."

Why do you use gradient based strategy? What is the advantage?\n\n* In the experimental setup in Section 5, if you do not neglect the hypothetical dependencies on $y_i$, would your framework correctly infer the learning rule, i.e., if you use $$g_\\theta = \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta, \\phi, \\gamma} \\theta_{\\alpha, \\beta, \\phi, \\gamma} x_j^\\alpha r^\\beta y_i^\\phi w_{ij}^\\gamma$$ would your model learn $\\theta_{\\alpha, \\beta, \\phi, \\gamma} = 0 \\quad \\forall \\phi \\neq 0$?"

The fact that the method is restricted to rate networks precludes interesting synaptic rules from spiking networks (e.g. spike-timing dependent plasticity) that could explain a wider a range of plasticity mechanisms, and thus limits the set of interesting rules that could be inferred using this method.\n\n2. I am skeptical of the generalisability of this method, since the discovered rules would strongly depend on the choice of loss function for the neural / behavioural data. While the experiments in section 4.2 with robustness to noise and sparsity work in the idealised setting, the robustness is demonstrated with Gaussian noise, which the MSE loss is by definition capable of ignoring, in the limit of infinite data. However, with real-world neural/behavioural data, we cannot always pinpoint the exact distribution of noise, and it would be practically quite difficult to construct a loss function that is robust to unknown noise. I am thus skeptical that the method would generalise to arbatrarily complex neural behaviours or trajectories, and that the inferred plasticity rules in these settings would be biologically plausible.\n\n3. Section 7 mentions that \"[a]nother issue is the model's \"sloppiness\" in the solution space; it fails to identify a unique sparse solution even with extensive data\". If this is the case with the current experiments in sections 4-6, how does this affect the interpretation of the results and how much can we rely on the experimental predictions about plasticity mechanisms? For instance, which particular experiment/solution forms the basis for the conclusions about the decay mechanism in 6.1 and bidirectional plasticity in 6.2?\n\n4. The experiments in section 6, appear to add terms to the parametrized rule based on previously hypothesised plasticity mechanisms in the fruit fly. Although, this was an effective method of exploration in this particular instance, how would this generalise to neural / behavioural datasets for which such hypotheses do not exist, or are unsatisfactory? If instead, we could perform rule inference using this method using MLPs or some other form of parametrization, how would we interpret the resulting rules?\n\nTaken together, it seems that although this method provides more biologically plausible rules that plasticity rule inference via optimizing for network function (Tyulmankov et al 2022, Confavreux et al 2020, Lindsey and Litwin-Kumar 2020, etc.), it swaps one set of loss functions for another, but still shares many of the same problems of generalisability and interpretation."

Differently from previous work, they optimize over the whole trajectory, instead of final weights/activity, and apply it also to behavioural data, instead of neural activity. One application has the loss as the distance to a target trajectory, obtained from a ground truth learning rule (Oja\u2019s rule), which is successfully recovered. In the second application, the output activity represents the probability of taking an action on a reward-seeking task, and the target is a trajectory of actions taken. This is applied to experimental data of a fruit fly in a setting where the rewarding action changes over time. A reward-based rule of the form x*(R - E[R]) - a*w is recovered, and variations with and without E[R] or -a*w factors are discussed."

Is it the case that one needs multiple output neurons just to have enough data, and it would be equivalent to having many instantiations of the simulation with single output neurons? Do the neurons for Oja's rule all simply learn the first principal component? \n\nRelated to this point, if all neurons in the output layer learn the same thing, the study in Fig.2 with noise and sparseness might simply reflect how many \"trials\" are needed for a single neuron simulation. Noise in this case would just make gradients for the meta-learning less informative, needing more trials, which would be true for any learning simulation.\n\nOne main contribution of the paper relative to previous work is optimizing trajectories, instead of endpoints, but it is not clear if this is a substantial advancement. It would strengthen this point to have more results and discussion on this difference. What kind of data can this model tackle that endpoint optimization can't? Would the results be the same? Is it a matter of data efficiency? How would endpoint optimization behave in the fly dataset? A technical point: is backprop through time used?\n\nOne main contribution of the paper is the fitting of behavioral data. But there is a gap between modelling a synapse and a whole system as if the fly was a single neuron. Why can modelling a single neuron work in this case? Isn't this approach more appropriate for neural data from the relevant neurons in the fly mushroom body?\n\nThere is a lack of theoretical grounding of the learning rules studied, e.g. that the Oja rule will learn the PC1; what are the optimal learning rules for the reward-based task?; what is the effect of the weight decay term on the learning rule? \n\nThere is no discussion on the time scale inherent to the learned weight decay term. How does it relate to trial times? Related, the effect of the time scale of the E[R] is subtle and will have a different effect if the average is within a trial or over multiple trials (see Fremaux, Sprekeler, Gerstner, J Neuroscience, 2010). Related to this point, did the authors try learning the E[R] factor separately, or learning the time scale? The discussion on weight dependent vs. expected reward factor loses strength due to these limitations.\n\nThe MLP rules are included but never discussed. They should be better motivated and referred to.\n\nMinor:\n\nIn the figures, it should show the factors in the ticks (e.g. x*R), instead of the binary parameter indexes, which are hard to decode."
