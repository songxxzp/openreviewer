First, the authors theoretically analyzes that the traditional data augmentation techniques cause  the long-tailed distribution to be imbalanced again. Specifically, the traditional data augmentation techniques cause inherent data-wise imbalance and extrinsic augmentation-wise imbalance, which are called as two birds in this paper. To kill the two birds, the authors propose an data augmentation technique termed DODA which make each class to choose appropriate augmentation methods. Experimental results on 4 benchmark datasets verify effectiveness of the DODA."

One can interpret the performance improvement described in the paper as simply due to the incorporation of extra data augmentation.\n\n2.
