                "value": "This paper builds upon the theoretical analysis framework introduced by Kanoh & Sugiyama (2022; 2023) to investigate the learning behavior of soft tree ensembles. It focuses on deriving closed-form solutions for the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) induced by infinitely many axis-aligned tree ensembles, considering two scenarios: always axis-aligned (AAA) and axis-aligned at initialization (AAI). Additionally, the paper extends the NTK framework to accommodate multiple tree architectures and demonstrates that any non-oblivious axis-aligned tree ensemble can be transformed into an axis-aligned oblivious tree ensemble while preserving the same NTK. The paper also explores the potential applications of multiple kernel learning (MKL) in identifying suitable tree architectures and features under the axis-aligned constraint. Empirical results are provided to validate the theoretical findings and illustrate the practical significance of the axis-aligned constraint in tree ensemble learning."

In Section 3.1, if I interpret it correctly, AAA refers to axis-aligned initialization, with the assumption that the selected split feature at each node remains constant throughout training. This assumption appears rather restrictive, considering that typical axis-aligned trees do not impose such constraints. It would be valuable if the author provided further insights or comments regarding this assumption.\n    \n2. The paper lacks an exploration of the computational complexity and scalability issues related to employing Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) for tree architecture search. It is crucial to assess the feasibility and efficiency of utilizing MKL, particularly for large-scale datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces."

Typically, I look to theory because it can provide insight or intuition about why some method is working well.  I did not get any of that here.  What does this theory explain about axis-aligned trees that we did not already know? \n\n2. There are several papers relating trees/forests to kernels.  The mondrian kernel is probably the most famous, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2969033.2969177, though Breiman wrote about it over 20 years ago prior to his random forest paper, https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.7078&rep=rep1&type=pdf. And we https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00029, and others, have some work on it as well, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7373647.  Those kernels are exact, whereas this kernel is an approximation.  Given that trees/forests directly induce a kernel, I do not understand why we would want to derive an approximate kernel?\n\n3. The primary results seem to depend on all the trees having the same architecture, and also all the features being somehow already selected?  I do not understand where the architecture or selected features come from?\n\n4.  The results also all seem to depend on soft, rather than hard, trees. Is that because the math is easier for soft trees? A few sentences about that in the discussion would be helpful context. I do not know of any tree packages that leverage soft trees, so if people actually use them in practice (I know the papers on Neural Forests, but I do not know whether they are actually used anywhere), that would be helpful context as well.  If nobody uses soft trees, that's ok, it just a limitation, and future work might be about getting similar results on hard trees, unless it is obviously (to you) not tractable. \n\n5. The empirical results are on a single dataset: tic-tac-toe.  It is a nice illustration.  I wonder, however, why this dataset was chosen specifically? Was it cherry-picked to have good results? Or was it because all the features are binary, and that helps for some reason? Or because depth 3 trees work well (at least the AAA/AAI ones)?  \n\n6.  For me, the fact that AAA works better than RF for certain alpha's is by far the most interesting result.  What features of the distribution is the axis-aligned NTK capturing that the RF fails to acquire? I am guessing the fact that they are depth 3 trees has something to do with it, because the RF can only handle 3 feature splits per path, and more are required to achieve Bayes optimal.  How does the NTK get around this issue, what is happening?  For me, this is by far the most interesting result, and I did not understand or see any text attempting to explain it."

What is the inductive bias of the NTK relative to the axis-aligned forests.  While the theory, on its own, is fine, I do not find it compelling on its own.  The arbitrarily slow convergence theorem (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00534199) implies that any given approach will outperform another with finite data.  So, from that perspective, the point of any paper describing a new approach is to provide insight into when/why it outperforms other approaches.  Curves plotting performance vs sample size, dimensionality, or various simulation parameters can all provide insight into this issue.  If the authors can provide clean compelling explanations about when/why their NTK would/does outperform RF or other kernel forest approaches, I think it would be very interesting.  Without that, however, I am just not that interested."
