                "value": "- The primary concern in this paper revolves around the significance of predicting the representation in the critic. The representations in the critic undergo drastic changes, exhibit high levels of instability, and lack interpretability. The author provides intuitive reasons for its effectiveness but lacks theoretical support and experimental analysis. Furthermore, due to the complexity of the algorithm architecture, including the use of GRU, attention mechanisms, and complex AC network structure, analyzing why this method is effective becomes more challenging.\n- There are many approaches to addressing the issue of partial observability, such as predicting the global state from local observations. However, this paper lacks a thorough investigation into such methods, and there is no discussion of related work in this regard. \n- The experimental evaluation in this paper is relatively weak. Firstly, the algorithm does not appear to converge. For instance,  fine-tuned QMIX can already achieve a 100% win rate on almost all SMAC tasks by itself. Can APC achieve better performance after sufficient training? Additionally, the experiments on MA MuJoCo only cover two tasks, and the performance of on-policy baselines in such tasks is not effective. The author should consider comparing with off-policy MARL algorithms. In addition, this paper is not compared to related works addressing the same issue. Certainly, this depends on a thorough investigation of related works, which is also a crucial aspect lacking in this paper.\n- Finally, in the appendix, the authors argue that predicting other agents' behaviors in the CTDE framework is not meaningful. I disagree with this viewpoint. Since the learning process in MARL is dynamic and the optimization direction is aligned, guided learning through policy gradients leads the agent's behavior to converge to suboptimal states. At this point, being able to make accurate estimates of other agents' behavior is likely to have a positive impact on the learning process."

Directly sharing the critic's input with the actor might be a more straightforward approach.\n- Intuitively, it seems that the proposed predictive loss in this paper should not rely on such complex architectural designs. Only through a comparison under identical architectures can it be demonstrated whether the proposed loss in this paper is truly effective. Would there be a performance gain when comparing under the same structure?\n- Could the authors provide a performance comparison on different tasks using the same network architecture as the baseline?"
