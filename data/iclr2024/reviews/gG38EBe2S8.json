The rank is selected adaptively based on a metric that measures the density along the morphing path.

Also, the LoRA rank adaption is heuristic and cannot be regarded as a major contribution.\n\n- The physical meaning of the relative perceptual path diversity (rPPD) score is not clear. Why the score is a ratio that divides the\nperceptual difference of the endpoint images? Moreover, the accumulated LPIPS difference cannot properly reflect the semantic difference of the input image pair. For example, the morphing for two bears that change a lot in location may be much easier than the morphing for two objects that differ significantly in semantics. To properly choose the LoRA rank, a much simpler metric that depends on CLIP score difference seems to suffice.\n\n- Some of the proposed techniques only bring marginal improvement. As shown in Table 2, the best model is more likely not to be the one with adaptive rank. And in Figure 4, the difference between (n) and (o) is not significant.\n\n- There is no quantitative study for the effectiveness of separate LoRA for unconditional score estimation.
