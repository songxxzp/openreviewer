                "value": "- MBR-style or consistency-based methods have also been applied to parsing for decoding or model selection, but the authors failed to recognize and discuss them. To name a few, [Smith and Smith, 2007](https://aclanthology.org/D07-1014.pdf) and [Zhang et al., 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.302.pdf) used MBR-decoding to improve dependency parsing; [Shi et al., 2019](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1180.pdf) adapted an agreement-based model selection process for distantly supervised constituency parsing.\n\n- The motivation is not completely convincing. Recent trends in NLP demonstrate that explicit parses might not be crucial or even necessary to many user-facing applications (e.g., GPT models do not really use explicit language structures), which contradicts the first sentence in this paper (*Constituency parsing is a core task in natural language processing*). Traditionally, such structures served as a backbone for many NLP models, and the prediction of them was therefore referred to as *core NLP*. I am not sure if the parsing is as important as what I receive from this paper. Please consider revising or including more justification. \n\n\n**Minor points on weaknesses**\n\n- The references in this paper, especially to conventional linguistic literature, need some work:\n    - Section 1: Carnie (2007) and Fromkin et al. (2003) are introductory books. Both should be changed to Chomsky (1957). Syntactic Structures.\n    - [Spitkovsky et al. (2013)](https://aclanthology.org/D13-1204.pdf) is worth a mention in the related work section.\n\n- Page 1: low correlation among different unsupervised parsers: [Williams et al. (2018)](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00019/43445/Do-latent-tree-learning-models-identify-meaningful) discovered a similar issue within the same model architectures (Table 1, right settings).\nThis is worth a discussion.\n\n- Not really a weakness for a machine learning conference submission: since the topic of this paper is highly linguistic, I am willing to see a detailed analysis of what patterns are fixed. For example, do NPs/PPs with rare words receive more fixes than those with frequent words, or the opposite, or not significant? Do VPs with transitive verb heads receive more fixes than those with intransitive verb heads, or the opposite, or insignificant? Does the student extract any constituent that does not receive any vote from teacher models, due to fixes on shorter spans and CYK?\n\nI am being conservative in my initial evaluation and am happy to increase my rating if most of the above issues are fixed."

There is indeed a performance boost in comparison to oracle score (the highest possible F1 score of binarize groundtruth trees).

In Results on SUSANNE, the authors claim that \u201cThis is a realistic experiment to examine the models\u2019 performance in an unseen low-resource domain.\u201d However, SUSANNE is an English dataset. In CoNLL Shared task, there are tree-banks on low-resource languages (Zeman et al., 2017).

                "value": "This work proposes a method for combining the outputs from unsupervised parsers in the manner similar to MBR decoding, but different in considering all possible trees. The proposed method simply assigns score to every span, a hit count that is the number of constituency appearing in outputs from multiple unsupervised parser. Then, it runs CKY to derive the maximum scored tree using the hit count score. Experiments on PTB and SUSANNE presents gains over SOTA baselines."

                "value": "- The proposed method is very simple to combine multiple outputs from unsupervised parsing, and the method might have an impact to other system combination method, e.g., NER with CRF. The ensemble by hit-count is sound and the merit is proved effective in the experiments especially when comparing MBR which can consider only spans in the multiple system outputs.\n\n- Experiments are well designed and the effect of the proposed method is proved empirically. This work also presents knowledge distillation using RNNG and URNNG so that it might have a potential for a practical application. Analysis is also convincing by comparing multiple diverse systems."
