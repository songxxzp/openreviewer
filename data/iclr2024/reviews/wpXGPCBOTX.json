                "value": "This article addresses the problem of inverse optimal transport, which involves estimating the transport cost from an optimal (noisy) transport plan. The authors focus on the 'penalized' $\\ell_1$ cost formulation, parametrized by a matrix of parameters (the cost is parametrized as linear combination of individual costs, such as in the Mahalanobis setting). The article provides two types of guarantees:\n\nThe first type of guarantee, referred to as the \"finite sample case,\" is an estimation guarantee obtained from dual certificates when the observed transport plan is an entropic regularized plan between two empirical measures.\n\nThe second type, in the \"Gaussian case,\" deals with the scenario where the measures involved are Gaussian distributions (a well-known case in transport that admits a closed-form solution). In this case, the article demonstrates that the cost estimation can be solved as a graphical lasso problem, especially when the entropic regularization is small."

                "value": "- I find that the article doesn't put in enough effort to explain the practical implications of the various theoretical results, which remain somewhat abstract. It's quite challenging to understand how these results can be practically applied.\n\nFirstly, the concept of a pre-certificate condition is rather very abstract (unlike the case of Lasso that we can somehow interpret). It would be interesting to provide the reader with a bit more guidance to offer a small interpretation of this quantity.\n\nAnother example is Proposition 8. It's difficult for me to extract something from this result, aside from the qualitative interpretation that \"for small regularization, under somewhat abstract assumptions of certificates, and with a sufficiently large number of samples, solving the invOT problem yields a good solution.\" To make these results more applicable in practice, it would be helpful to either provide experiments or guarantees that demonstrate how to understand these pre-certificate assumptions or ensure that the level of regularization is appropriate. I realize that these may be challenging questions, but I find that not much intuition is given, and the practical use of these results does not appear straightforward.\n\n- My main criticism concerns the experiments section. I find the experiments too limited and somewhat confusing, making it difficult to obtain meaningful information.\n\nFirst, only the Gaussian with an identity covariance is considered. The idea is to study the impact of entropic regularization on invOT estimation. The presentation is somewhat unclear, and I struggle to understand from Figure 1 how it quantifies the influence of $\\epsilon$ on the estimation. There is no legend for the y-axis, and while it's understood to be the certificate value between two nodes, it's unclear how it serves as a good performance measure for the invOT problem. \n\nFigure 2 is equally unenlightening. It aims to determine the influence of the number of samples on the estimation in the very simple case of a circular graph and Gaussian measures. However, what is the x-axis on these three figures? Is it the number of iterations? The geodesic distance? If it's the geodesic distance, it's not clear because the y-axis is a global performance measure over C, while the x-axis appears to be a local measure, so it's unclear how one evolves with the other.\n\nThe conclusion appears to be that the estimation is \"good\" when the entropic regularization is sufficiently large, and the number of samples is also large. More importantly, there seems to be a significant gap: when $\\epsilon \\leq 10$, the estimation is consistently poor. Is this a result expected by the theory regarding $\\epsilon$?"
