Once more data is acquired, the surrogates are also updated.\n* The specific acquisition function is a variation of expected improvement, including a term that captures the cost of running the finetuning pipeline (as opposed to being based purely on performance alone).\n* In experiments, the surrogates are trained on a large set of learning curves from the timm benchmark. The algorithm is then applied to the Meta-Album dataset, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baselines.\n* Ablations where the meta-training step and cost-aware acquisition are removed demonstrate that both parts are important."
