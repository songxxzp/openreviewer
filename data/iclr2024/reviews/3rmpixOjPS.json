The reparameterization technique is used in CNNs but surprisingly unexplored in ViTs. The paper presents a linear-based re-parameterization for vanilla Vision Transformers, without any convolutional operations. The authors introduce a specific linear stack with batch normalization for added nonlinearity and a pyramid multi-branch structure for feature fusion. They also highlight the importance of distribution consistency in deep networks, especially for ViTs, and introduce a Two-Dimensional Re-parameterized Linear module (TDRL) to address this. To enhance re-parameterization, different depths of linear stacks are used to create a pyramid multi-branch structure. Since this multi-branch structure can lead to instability in training,  authors suggest 1) an additional batch normalization to modulate the distributions of Q and K in the attention mechanism to rectify the distribution changes. 2) For other components like Feed Forward Networks (FFN), where the variance change isn't as drastic as in attention calculation, features are re-scaled using the square root of N instead of being normalized."

This is important, particularly for the tiny models, because pure ViTs lag behind the ConvNets and hybrid models due to the lack of inductive bias and inadequate capacity. Reparametrization, training with extra parameters but shrinking back at the inference stage, is a good way to fit more knowledge into the models without incurring extra inference costs.\n\n2. TDRL seems to be a generic method and can be applied to many architectures, e.g., VanillaNet, and different tasks, e.g., DDPM, with linear layers.\n\n3. With the help of varied-depth branches and feature rectification, TDRL achieves promising results on classification and dense prediction tasks, especially the latter."

This might further strengthen the paper.\n\n2. I noticed that the gain from TDRL is considerably larger on dense prediction tasks. Do the authors have any explanation for it? Is it due to the use of BN in TDRL since some dense prediction tasks favor architectures with BN? If so, can the authors isolate the contributions of reparametrization and BN?\n\n3. Certain parts of the presentation could be further improved. For example, Fig. 1c does not help grasp how to do intra/inter-branch merging."

And there is only 1$\\times$1 (without K$\\times$K) in linear projection, the accuracy gaps in different configurations of \"pyramid multi-branch topology\" seems minor (Figure 2a).\n\n-2- About the baseline performance. Table 1 reports the performance improvement on ViT-B, with the distillation phase in pre-training. Why the proposed TDRL should be combined with distillation? Why not use a stronger and simpler baseline such as DeiT-B (can obtain 81.8 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet)?"

                "value": "In Sec 3.2, the authors claim that \"The linear operation in transformers focuses more on intra-token semantic mining rather than inter-token spatial exploration. Linear stacking is inherently appropriate to transformer networks.\" I think the authors should explain this in more details. I am confused why Linear stacking is inherently appropriate to transformer networks."
