The assertion that any general RNN can be treated as a linear RNN in A.4 is fundamentally incorrect. In reality, a general RNN may not behave near a fixed point, resulting in significant higher-order terms. Furthermore, the analysis pertains to a task, the VARIABLE BINDING TASK, which is notably distinct from a translation task.\n\n2. The current analysis lacks novelty. The article primarily employs linear projection techniques to examine the components of RNN weights, a methodology that has been in use for a considerable period.\n\n3. The presentation lacks clarity. Figures 1 and 2 are difficult to comprehend, and their intended message is unclear. Additionally, the mention of GSEMM seems unnecessary since the current work solely involves a simple linear RNN. There is a lack of a concise summary of the core mechanisms of the RNN."

For the authors to make claims about variable binding in general, they would need to show tasks that do more than just require sequential repeats of the input. \n\n\n\nA substantial issue for me is that I am confused about the elements that the authors label as being novel here. Most of them are, at least at a broad level, well-represented in the neuroscience-inspired RNN literature. For example, the authors say in the discussion:\n\nwe provide \"a novel perspective on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), framing them as dy-\nnamical systems performing sequence memory retrieval\". The original Ellman model itself uses RNNs for a form of sequence memory retrieval, but also several more recent works study serial working memory with RNNs such as: https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/30/6/1449/8400/A-Theory-of-Sequence-Indexing-and-Working-Memory and https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-04733-001\n\n\"We introduced the concept of \u201cvariable\nmemories,\u201d linear subspaces capable of symbolically binding and recursively composing informa-\ntion.\"  The notion of storing different items in different linear subspaces has also been explored: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm0204\n\n\"We presented a new class of algorithmic tasks that are designed to probe the variable binding\nbehavior of RNNs. \" As represented by the above studies on serial working memory, this class of tasks is not new. \n\n\"for the first time, revealed hidden neurons actively involved in in-\nformation processing in RNNs. \" This is obviously not the first time people have studied how neurons process information in RNNs (see the work of Omri Barak and David Sussillo, e.g.). \n\nOn the whole I also don't see the specific value in claiming that this analysis is related to episodic memory.

                "value": "I have several major issues with this work, as detailed below.\n\n(1) While the mathematical formulation is meaningful, I believe this is not episodic memory (and this proposed method is not a theory of episodic memory). The model and mathematical framework may be inspired by episodic memory models, but the task, objective and entire narrative is largely unrelated to episodic memory. RNNs receiving variable inputs, performing computations based on those variable inputs, and subsequently producing an output is straightforward decision-making or information-processing in many cases, including this work. This is further supported by Figure 1, where performing an addition operation is merely a simple computation that does not even require any memory storage or retrieval. Knowing how to add is not episodic memory. I am open to discussion if the authors still feel it is correctly defined.\n\n(2) The way the entire paper is structured is unnecessarily confusing. I can summarize the work in the following manner:\n- Consider an input vector with $d$ dimensions that spans $s$ timesteps, with a total of $sd$ input elements\n- The number of neurons in the RNN needs to be greater than $sd$ otherwise superposition effects will occur\n- The authors perform a change of basis such that the first $sd$ elements of the latent activity within the RNN now represent the (human interpretable, one-to-one mapped) input sequence with some shifting. This is referred to as \"variable memory\" by the authors (which is well-named and easily understood if not convoluted by the hard-to-parse narrative leading to its definition).\n\nRight now a reader requires knowledge in RNNs and their applications in neuroscience, as well as some experience in mathematical tools commonly found in modern physics to fully understand the work, when in reality this paper could be written to a pure RNN audience without the Dirac and Einstein notations (at least in the main text), by simply stating that information about the latent is being carefully tracked by a basis transformation and formulating the equations in that context.\n\n(3) The effects described in Figure 3 and 4A are specific to the repeat-copy task. More complex tasks (especially those with non-periodic solutions) may result in weight matrices that are not interpretable or offer any additional insight. Similarly, the compose-copy task, which is surprisingly never defined in this paper (but can be inferred from the Figure 4B to be generating the sequence one unit at a time), is the only task that will give rise to such interpretable values. In general, the authors summarize this class of tasks as $f$ in equation (2). The intended narrative is that the authors are using a class of tasks to elegantly highlight the feature of the proposed method, but my impression is that the method will not be producing anything meaningful beyond this class of tasks."
