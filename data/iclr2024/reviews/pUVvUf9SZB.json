This paper is a follow up of the original paper proposing this framework. More specifically, in this submission, the authors prove that a concurrent verifier preserves convexity on typical multi-class convex learning problems such as logistic regression, multi-class SVM, etc. The authors also improve the generalisation error bound in some conditions, besides removing some restrictions inherent from the previous model."
