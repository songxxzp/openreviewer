Based on the intuitive idea that, in such challenging scenarios, one only has to rely on rough reward estimates as humans do, they propose a method called DreamSmooth. In DreamSmooth the reward model is now tasked to predict a temporally smoothed reward instead of the exact reward. The authors propose 3 reward-smoothing schemes and empirically show that the approach can significantly improve the performance on most sparse reward scenarios."

The authors observe that on sparse reward tasks, it is challenging to fit an accurate reward model due to data imbalance. This in turn bottlenecks the performance of model-based RL methods like Dreamer. To mitigate this problem, the authors apply a smoothing function to the reward, effectively spreading the reward signal to adjacent states in the trajectory. The authors propose three reward smoothing functions: Gaussian, Uniform, and EMA. While EMA is the only function that guarantees policy invariance, all three are empirically found to work well, resulting in more accurate reward predictions and higher performance in sparse reward tasks compared to baselines."

For example, if a bad state is visited right after a successful state vs. after a sequence of bad states, it would get assigned different smoothed reward values. How does reward ambiguity affect MBRL methods? I suspect the recurrent architecture of Dreamer helps mitigate this issue. To verify, can you run a Markovian MBRL method like MBPO with reward smoothing and see if there's any improvement there?\n- There are inductive biases built into each smoothing function. For example, Gaussian and Uniform smoothing functions assume symmetry. However, this may not align with the environment dynamics. Consider a ball rolling off a staircase and receiving a sparse reward right at the edge of the staircase. The smoothing function bumps up the reward of the states before and after falling off the staircase, but in practice, it is much harder to climb back up from the lower platform than to roll down. In other words, reward smoothing can give rise to overoptimistic behaviors. Do you see this reflected in any task?\n- Does reward smoothing benefit model-free methods such as policy gradient?"
