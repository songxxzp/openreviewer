Before querying the target model, the attacker first perturbs the target image in such a way that it produces differing predictions between shadow models trained with and without the target image. Subsequently, the attacker queries the target model with the perturbed image and examines the predicted label. Remarkably, YOQO can achieve state-of-the-art performance with just a single query."

YOQO's key innovation lies in its identification of an \"improvement area\" around a target sample, enabling the crafting of query samples with hard labels that effectively determine the target sample's membership, significantly reducing the query budget required from over 1,000 queries to just one query. The study demonstrates that YOQO exhibits effectiveness comparable to state-of-the-art Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) while demonstrating greater resilience against various defense mechanisms. This underscores its significance in the context of privacy attacks on machine learning models."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Two noteworthy concerns arise in the evaluation of the paper.\n\nFirst, in terms of the chosen evaluation metric, the authors have opted for accuracy to assess the performance of their attack. However, there are concerns about the appropriateness of this choice. While I agree that using a log-scale ROC curve may not be practical for this case, the fundamental issue at hand pertains to the need for evaluating the worst-case scenario for MIA. Based on my understanding, samples closer to the decision boundary should have a higher probability of being classified as members, while those significantly distant from this boundary may exhibit a lower likelihood of membership. Consequently, assessing accuracy across all samples may not effectively unveil the worst-case performance. To address this, a suggestion is made to focus on accuracy calculations for samples located farthest from the decision boundary, even though the attacker may lack knowledge of the specific location of such samples. The presence of ground truth information during the evaluation phase supports the feasibility of this approach.\n\nSecond, the experimental setting raises concerns regarding overfitting. The target model is trained with a relatively small dataset of 2,500 samples, which could potentially result in severe overfitting. Although the paper does not explicitly state the training and testing accuracy gap for the target model, it can be inferred from the GAP attack that the overfitting level exceeds 40%, potentially impacting the reliability of the conclusions. I would like to see the authors conduct experiments on well-generalized models, involving a larger training dataset to mitigate the risk of overfitting.\n\nIn Section 3.2, when the authors optimize the x to get the improvement area, they believe that Equation 3 won\u2019t work since scalars in both in models and out models are in [0,1]. I agree, and to address this constraint, the authors adapt Equation 1 into a minimization problem, which is a common practice in finding adversarial examples. Just out of curiosity, I wonder whether adding a weight term $\\lambda$ to Equation 2 could achieve the same result, that is, turn the output of in models to [0,$\\lambda$]."

The evaluations clearly show that YOQO is the new SOTA label only MIA. I have the following few concerns about the paper:\n\n- Although the experimental setup considered is the common setup in most prior works, it contains mostly small datasets with very small training dataset sizes. Can authors perform experiments on larger datasets, e.g., Imagenet? \n- I could not figure out the training recipe from the main paper. In particular does the training ensure that the models don\u2019t overfit to the training data, e.g., using L2 regularization or any other common regularization techniques? I feel the criterion that training goes on until a model has >98% accuracy on training data may lead to overfitting that will lead to unnecessarily stronger MIAs.\n- On the same lines as the above comment, can authors add a few more details of various dataset sizes used in training with/without defenses, e.g., adversarial regularization? Also can they add details of training procedure? These are important given that MIA efficacy is greatly affected by these factors.\n- Utility of the attack: I could not understand from the current evaluations how the attack will perform in the real world. The dataset sizes are quite small which is seldom the case now a days, unless if model is fine-tuned using a small dataset. Can authors provide results for some real-world settings? Some suggestions: 1) use larger datasets 2) fine-tune a model pre-trained on large datasets?"
