Contrastive learning, the main theme of the paper, is not defined in the paper. Readers cannot understand what kind of data we are handling and suddenly see the pair of (X, A) and (X', A') in Section 3.1. without knowing what kind of real data these symbols correspond to in real applications. \n1. The explanation of Theorem 1 is wrong. Theorem 1 roughly says that distance among points in hyperbolic space can be approximated by a tree, but does NOT say its converse.  However, your explanation is \"any tree can be embedded into a\nPoincar\u00e9 disk with low distortion.\" This is the converse of Theorem 1.\n1. Many important definitions are missed. What are $p_\\\\mathrm{pos}$ and $p_\\\\mathrm{data}$ in Equation (1)? Also, $p$ and $D$ are not defined in Equation (9).\n1. Theorem 3 says nothing since the left-hand side, the negative KL distance, is always non-positive and the right-hand side, Erank, which is the entropy of the normalized singular values, is always non-negative. Also, these are not strongly related. If we consider $\\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{0},c\\\\mathbf{I})$, we can see that the entropy of the normalized singular values is constant but the KL divergence varies as we change $c$. For the above reasons, the discussion of the results in Table 3 using Erank, which is the entropy of the normalized singular values of the covariance matrix in the tangent space, does not support the justification of the proposed method. First of all, the authors could have shown the value $\\\\mathcal{L}_{U}^\\\\mathcal{T}$ in Table 3, instead of Erank. Hence, the whole structure of the paper needs significant improvement. This technical issue regarding Theorem 3 is the strongest concern about this paper.\n1. The motivation of introducing the term $\\\\mathcal{L}_{U}^\\\\mathcal{T}$ is to force the uniformity. However, since the normal distribution decays exponentially in the tangent space and the surface area of a hyper-ball in hyperbolic space exponentially grows with respect to its radius $r$, the density of the normal distribution decays double exponentially. So the concentration effect is much more dominant than the uniformity effect. The authors have not discussed it.\n1. In Section 3.1., it says \"The N pairs of node embeddings,... as in Appendix B.\" However, the reason is not described.\n1. Figure 4 does not make sense since the author states that 4b is the best while 4b ignores the topology of the original tree. If we could ignore the topology of the original graph, we should randomly map them to the lattice in Euclidean space. Also, if we consider the hyperbolic distance, 4d seems more uniform than 4b.\n1. The proposed method does not scale well with respect to the dimensionality, since it involves the determinant calculation. It might not be critical in real applications where the dimensionality is not large."

For a given graph, two views are randomly produced by applying random perturbations (dropping egdes and nodes). These are fed to a 2-layer GCN to get node embeddings, which are then projected onto a Poincar\u00e9 ball. A loss is then designed to achieve representation learning in this space. A first classical term based on the distance in this hyperbolic space is proposed to promote alignment of views. A second term handles the diversity of these representations by ensuring that embeddings populate the ball uniformly. To this end, authors propose to map embeddings into an Euclidean space where representations are forced to fit an isotropic gaussian distribution. This method allows to prevent the well-known dimensional collapse for which authors propose a clear taxonomy when learning in hyperbolic spaces.\nThen they benchmark their method to several supervised GNN and contrastive methods using common evaluation in this literature, for node classification and collaborative filtering. HyperGCL consistently outperforms other compared methods across 8 datasets. Finally, the authors analyze both theoretically and empirically the effectiveness of HyperGCL in preventing dimensional collapse using the notion of effective rank."

This should be clear in the paper. Also it seems to mitigate the theoretical contribution stated in Theorem 2.\n   - b)\tOptimization in Riemannian framework is clearly an active field of research whose advances seem to be disregarded by authors e.g [B], [C]. Could you further justify your choice for RSGD and perform simple benchmarks with other more recent approaches ?\n   - c)\tVarious clearly competitive approaches are not benchmarked e.g GraphMAE [D] and more importantly CCA-SSG [E]. The latter also conducts a reflection to circumvent to dimensional collapse when operating in an Euclidean setting. The uniformity loss essentially comes down to enforcing embedding covariances to be close to an identity matrix like the one of an isotropic gaussian distribution. [E] also establishes relations between CCA-SSG and Mutual Information maximization under gaussian assumptions so in substance it clearly seems like an Euclidean counter to HyperGCL. As such clear comparisons should be present in the paper. Interestingly, It seems that these methods need a higher embedding dimension to compete/outperform HyperGCL which was benchmarked for a fixed embedding dimension of 50 but where the curvature parameter needs to be fine-tuned. \n\n**3.
