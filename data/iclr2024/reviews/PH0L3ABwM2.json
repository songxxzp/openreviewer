                "value": "It is known in PbRL that the inaccurate reward model compounding with overestimation bias on Q functions can lead to sub-optimal policies, and subsequently cause poor trajectory sampling and low feedback efficiency. This paper tackles this issue by proposing a non-parametric, graph-based model to learn a lower bound empirical Q-value, and then combined it with a SAC-style policy learning objective. Although the motivation is good, the proposed method suffers from a number of noticeable drawbacks. Please see the following strengths and weaknesses for detailed comments."

                "value": "- One of the biggest problems of this paper is that its graph-structured non-parameterized model is only applicable to tasks with discrete states space, or tasks with states and actions that can be enumerated (like the image-based task considered in this paper, there are only finite possible image outcomes). For general continuous control tasks, this method is very impractical. This limits the technical contribution of this work.\n- The reason to introduce the non-parametric model as claimed in this paper, is to avoid query unseen actions and avoid overestimation. If this is the case, then why not consider incorporating well-established techniques from offline RL on the replay buffer, like in [1]? Some in-sample learning offline RL methods such as IQL[2] (and a few other methods) can achieve exactly the same purpose but in a much simpler way. The only extra benefit of adopting a graph-based model is the ability to sample new trajectories from the graph, but this part is not carefully ablated, and we do not know whether the performance gains are primarily due to non-overestimated Q values or trajectory sampling.\n- Most of the proposed method is to prevent the overestimation of Q values, and it is only weakly relevant to the PbRL problem. Of course, the inaccurate rewards in PbRL can cause the overestimation issue to have a greater impact, but I do not see too many technical designs that are specifically designed for the PbRL problem.\n- As for Theorem 3.1, the authors only proved $\\hat{Q}$ will lower bound and converge to $Q^*$ learned using Bellman optimality equation under tabular case. However, it says nothing about the property of the final Q-value learned using Eq.(5). There is no analysis on the final Q-value learned with the soft Bellman residual and the distribution-constrained loss, which makes the theoretical analysis insignificant.\n- The evaluations are only conducted in two special test environments that are compatible with the graph-structured model. Common PbRL benchmarks like B-Pref are not evaluated. I suppose the proposed method simply cannot run on such continuous control tasks.\n\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Ji, T., et al.

However, I am seeking clarification regarding the formal properties of the resulting policy, denoted as SAC $\\pi_{\\phi}$. Are we anticipating it to exhibit conservatism or optimism? Additionally, the author contends that it \"aligns with human preference.\" Could this alignment be elucidated in a more rigorous manner?\n\n* The author state that \"theoretically, we demonstrate that the empirical Q-function is a lower-bound of ....\" in the Abstract. However, it is challenging to discern the precise details from Theorem 3.1. in a main text. Several elements remain undefined, such as the exact meanings of $Q_t$ and $\\hat Q_t$ in the main text, as well as the underlying assumptions (e.g., do we need assumptions for rewards to say $\\hat Q_t$ converges to $Q^{\\star}$?  ) \n\n* The proposed framework appears to be tailored for tabular settings, primarily due to its reliance on an empirical Q-function. How does the author intend to extend this approach to accommodate continuous settings, particularly in terms of both algorithmic and theoretical considerations?\n\n* In a related context, update (3) seems somewhat naive in addressing the data coverage concern.
