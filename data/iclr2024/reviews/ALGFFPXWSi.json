ULR is based on the old idea of zero-order optimization with likelihood ratio, reinterpreted in way that allows for optimising neural networks while avoiding back propagation, either entirely or some parts of it. By adding noise to either the activations or the weights, with the likelihood ratio method one only needs the loss (which can even be non-differentiable) evaluated at the noisy inputs in order to obtain a gradient for the terms that contributed to the noisy input (instead of the gradient of the loss itself with respect to the noisy input). The authors discuss how this idea generalises to various architectures, while also discussing three specific techniques that reduce the variance of the gradient estimates, which is very important for the practical success of a zero-order method. The authors evaluate ULR on several tasks and architectures while also performing an ablation study on their proposed variance reduction techniques and the impact of the perturbations on various points in the network."

How is the performance with adaptive noise?\n- On the RNN side, it seems that the authors add noise on each step, which can compound over time. Why is this strategy preferred compared to, e.g., just adding noise to the weights and evaluating the entire sequence on these noised weights (e.g., as done for convolutional layers). \n- I would suggest the authors to incorporate the variance reduction techniques to ES as well, in order to better highlight what the delta with ULR is. \n- At Figure 6, it is unclear what are the BP and ULR metrics. \n- At Figure 7 what is the reference BP gradient compared against? The true gradient of the noised loss (i.e., the one that includes the noise from ULR) or the gradient of loss without any noise (which is the one we care about)? \n- At the discussion of Figure 5 and Demo 1, the authors argue that the ULR can skip the calculation in late layers, however, this is not entirely true as ULR still needs the forward pass through those layers to compute the loss value. \n- Finally, the accuracy of the base BP model on CIFAR 10 is kind of small; do the authors use data augmentations?"
