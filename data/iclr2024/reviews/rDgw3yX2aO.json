                "value": "The paper proposes a new scheme for defending against poisoning attacks in cross-silo FL under secure aggregation. The scheme uses optimal coding techniques to split the federated learning clients into possibly overlapping groups. Each group's models are securely aggregated into a single model the server observes. Each group's aggregated model is tested by the server separately on auxiliary data for maliciousness. This allows the server to detect the presence of malicious or severely out-of-distribution clients in each group and, from that, deduce the identity of the malicious clients based on their group participation patterns cleverly chosen by the server. Finally, the server removes the perceived malicious clients from the federated process. The scheme tradeoffs privacy and security by allowing different sizes of groups to be chosen by the server, which, thanks to the optimal coding scheme used, also corresponds to the effective secure aggregation size of the FL process. The authors show experiments on different datasets and models, demonstrating that the scheme can be effective at defending against malicious clients while ensuring the privacy of benign clients."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- **Structure and Novelty of the submission:**   \nThere are three major components to this paper. First, the paper suggests the use of group-testing strategies to determine which clients are malicious in the context of the cross-silo FL setup with secure aggregation. In this context, the authors prove how overlapping test groups affect the overall client privacy, as secure aggregation is not commonly applied over overlapping groups. This part of the paper is novel and constitutes the biggest technical contribution of the paper. Then, the authors use optimal codes to determine an efficient way to group clients such that a chosen level of privacy is ensured while the decoding ( aka malicious client identification ) can work well. This is mostly based on prior work from coding theory and contains little to no technical novelty. Finally, the paper then applies the optimal detection strategy from [1] without any changes to the problem of malicious client identification. The paper does not give proper credit to [1], given that it essentially just applies the algorithm presented there and instead re-derives most of the work in Section 5. To this end, there is little to no novel technical contribution in that part of the paper either. One area where the paper could have expanded on [1] and could have provided a real technical contribution is instantiating the many choices of [1] to the FL problem considered. Unfortunately, the paper does very little of that as it takes the absolute simplest choice for a test, models the threshold $\\Lambda$ as a tunable hyperparameter ( pretty much independent of the proposed FA/MD trade-off ), assumes $\\delta$ is known ( something that even the authors agree is not a reasonable assumption ), and use embarrassingly simple $Q(t|s)$ model. All in all, therefore, the paper provides very little novel technical contribution, which is sad, as the idea of applying group testing to this problem seems interesting and promising.   \nStructurally, the paper wastes Section 5 by re-deriving [1] without giving [1] the proper credit and also compromising the explanation of the decoding, as the space is not enough for a full explanation of the decoding method. This space would have been much better spent on explaining the instantiation of [1] to the federated setting, e.g., what coding scheme is used, what test is used, how is $Q(t|s)$ chosen, etc., which is currently done all over the place. Further, it would have been good if the paper explained the properties of this instantiation and why it makes sense in the federated case. For example, the paper could have explained what the chosen coding strategies guarantee in the context of the FL problem being solved, what their communication complexity is, and how reasonable a test based on additional validation data and known attack parameters ( such as the targetted classes and number of malicious clients ) is. \n- **The defense relies on unreasonable assumptions and introduces too many hyperparameters:**   \nWhile the experiments provided in the paper suggest the proposed group testing strategies have the potential to constitute a good defense, the particular instantiation is unsatisfactory.   \nIn particular, in the main paper, the authors assume unrealistic knowledge by the defender, such as known $\\delta$ and known target class in the targetted version of the attack. While $\\delta$ is shown to be not that important in Figure 9, wrong $\\delta$ should be the default setting in which all experiments are carried out, as it is the only way to carry out the attack in the first place. Providing experiments with known $\\delta$ is fine for ablation purposes but nothing more. Moreover, the known target is also a big assumption, as if the test is carried out for multiple targets, this can introduce additional noise in the test and lower the presented results.  \nFurther, the added hyperparameters $\\Lambda$, $p$, and $\\rho$ are hard to tune in practice. In particular, choosing $\\Lambda$ heuristically depending on the setting, is hard and only possible through several re-trainings of the model. This is caused by the author's choice to tune $\\Lambda$, which is an uninterpretable parameter in $(-\\infty,\\infty)$ to which the results are very sensitive, instead of $\\Delta'$, which can be interpreted as a tradeoff between FA and MD. Further, I find the chosen model of $Q(t|s)$ which only depends on a single $p$ (the probability of error), too simplistic and hard to guess. I would suggest the authors instead at least choose $Q(t|s)$ as a probability distribution of the hamming distance between $t$ and $s$. This will at least account for the fact that individual tests can fail separately. Finally, $\\rho$ is likely to be dependent on the heterogeneity level and complexity of the problem and might also be hard to tune.\n- **Current experimental results are not strong enough:**   \nDespite the multiple hyperparameters introduced by the authors, the method still produces results that, in many cases, do not beat the baseline the authors themselves provide( [2] ). This is especially visible in Figures 4 and 5 in the Appendix, where the authors' method consistently performs worse in simple settings like MNIST. It seems that the proposed model, as it is, is mostly capable of beating [2] in heterogeneous settings where targetted attacks with known targets are applied. While this is an important setting that is worth solving separately, this is a clear drawback of the method that is not discussed by the authors. If this is where the method really works better than alternatives, the whole paper needs to focus on this setting and explain why this setting is favorable to their method ( or unfavorable for other methods ). Further, to allow realistic apples-to-apples comparisons, as mentioned above, authors should remove the known target and $\\delta$ assumptions (which I assume are not needed by [2]) and discuss how many clients are being securely aggregated by [2]. If the experiments for [2] aggregate all clients ( which I suspect is the case ), then the numbers are even worse for the proposed method, as [2] is in the \"most private\" setting where security is harder to achieve and yet still beats the proposed method regularly.\nFinally, another concern regarding the results is the fact the method seems to affect more clean accuracy compared to [2] and even the no defense ( according to Tables 1-3 ). This might suggest that good defense properties demonstrated in the paper are currently achieved on the back of too-high FA rates, tanking the clean performance. \n- **Runtime concerns:**\nThe authors say in the main paper repeatedly they focus on the cross-silo FL setting which they define to be up to 100 devices. Yet, in their experiments, the authors only use 15, and in the scaling experiment in Appendix J, they claim they do not even scale to 31 when some more precise encodings are used. This needs to be explicitly discussed in the main paper, but also severely jeopardizes the applicability of the proposed algorithm.\n- **Other:**\n1. The discussion on communication complexity needs to be at least partially moved to the main paper. The authors keep claiming their communication complexity as an important contribution, but unless one reads the appendix, they do not even know what the communication complexity of this and baseline models are.\n2. In all experiments, provide information on what the FA and MD rates are. Further, provide experiments where you change $\\Lambda$ and show how this affects FA and MD rates and how it affects the attacker's accuracy and the model's clean accuracy.\n3. Make explicit in **the main paper** that the current methodology works only for data poisoning and not model poisoning. ( Essentially bring the \"**Beyond data poisoning**\" point from Appendix L to the main paper )\n4. If the authors plan on keeping Sec. 5, which I do not recommend, they should at least provide some justification for the forward and backward formulas. \n- **Nits:**\n1. The last paragraph on page 3 does not explain when a test is positive ( i.e. is it when the group has a malicious client or when there isn't ). Add this to the definition\n2. The $s=d \\vee A^T$ notation, when first introduced, is confusing if the reader is unfamiliar with the group testing literature. Maybe explain that this is matrix multiplication where the dot product uses \"ands\" for multiplication and \"ors\" for additions."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Can the authors provide an additional experiment where they change $\\Lambda$ and show how this affects the FA and MD rates and how it affects the attacker's accuracy and the model's clean accuracy? Which is more detrimental for the performance of FedGT - high FA or high MD ratios?\n- Can the authors explain why the CIFAR10 attack success goes down even without defense in Figure 4 ?\n- Can the authors provide a linear scale version of Figure 4? Log scale in the attacker's accuracy both makes it hard to read and also obfuscates the results, which are not naturally log distributed. \n- Can the authors provide experiments where the defender does not know the targets for the targeted attacks?\n- Can the authors explain how many clients are securely aggregated by [2] in their experiments?\n- Can the authors provide runtimes of the method for different numbers of clients and encodings? Can the authors provide a worst-case or average-case runtime analysis (in terms of big-O notation)?\n\nAll in all, this paper has the potential to introduce a very interesting defense mechanism with good performance and interesting properties. However, it does not do any of this. It does not properly instantiate the algorithms used in the federated setting, as it chooses super basic tests and sets everything else to impossible to obtain in practice hyperparameters. Possibly due to this, the results on the defense side are underwhelming, even when the comparison is done in a very favorable way to the proposed method by giving more information to the defender than typically assumed while also comparing to a method that cannot benefit from the trade-off described in this paper in terms of security-vs-privacy. Further, the method seems to be very computationally expensive to the server in cases where more than a handful of clients are available, and the clean accuracy is sometimes severely penalized possibly due to a high FA ratio.\n\n\n[1] Gianluigi Liva, Enrico Paolini, and Marco Chiani.

For example, why one needs to choose A with good distance properties and how to choose it. Readers who are not familiar with coding theory may find it difficult to understand.\n\n3.\tConventional linear block codes (defined by their generator matrices) are defined on finite fields, for which binary addition (or XOR) is used. However, in the context of group testing, the check node is evaluated using logical OR operation. It is not clear how conventional block codes can be directly used here as candidates for the assignment matrix."
