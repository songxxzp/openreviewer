Moreover, it is natural to ask whether the OOD generalization of O2B with full-information algorithms has already been addressed.\n2) I am not convinced that the generalization error defined in Eq. (3) can reflect the generalization ability of the estimated reward\nparameters $\\theta$, because the first term $C_{ER}$ is an upper bound that does not depend on $\\theta$, and the second term directly computes the reward by using $\\theta$. Note that in the bandit setting, one should first utilize the estimated parameters $\\theta$ to select an arm, and the reward of the arm is computed on the underlying model of the reward function i.e., $\\theta^\\\\ast$.\n3) It is not clear whose regret is reflected by the weighted regret defined in Eq. (4). So, combining with the above concern on the definition of the generalization error, I am not convinced that the generalization error bound derived in this paper can really reflect the hardness of OOD generalization.\n4) Although the authors argue that \"theoretical analysis provides justification for why and how the learned adaptive batch learner can achieve OOD generalization error guarantees\", the proposed algorithm actually is not strictly designed under their theoretical results. Specifically, it is too heuristic to learn the weights via the Multi-Layer Perceptron."

In other words, given a context, the MLP predicts a softmax weighting of the K bandit models such that the corresponding weighted mixture of their estimated rewards fits the logged reward in the training data.\n\nThe authors provide regret bounds to suggest that an adaptive mixture can do better than a fixed online-to-offline batch conversion strategy (e.g., a static mixture of all K bandits' reward estimates), and provide a number of different strategies for selecting the K constituent bandit models in the ensemble.\n\nThe paper concludes with experiments on a synthetic dataset and a real-world video recommendations dataset (KuaiRec) to compare AdaO2B with different fixed online-to-offline batch conversion methods.

                "value": "The main weaknesses of this paper are in the areas of 1) novelty; 2) soundness of the theoretical analysis; and 3) completeness and significance of the empirical evaluations.\n\nRegarding novelty, there is already a great deal of prior work on learning adaptive or hierarchical mixtures. The adaptive method proposed in this paper was previously proposed by Jacobs et al. 1991 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/jjnh91.pdf), though not cited here. And adaptive mixtures have been employed elsewhere in the recommations space: Kumthekar et al. 2019 (https://research.google/pubs/pub49380/) focus on adaptively mixing shared models for multitask learning, which is admittedly different from handling temporal drift.\n\nRegarding theoretical soundness, my main concern is that the bound in theorem 1, equation (5), does not seem particularly useful, but perhaps I am misunderstanding it.  It has two terms: the first is what I would call the \"value-add\" term of using an adaptive mixture rather than a fixed mixture. And the second describes the worst-case / \"out of distribution\" penalty which cannot be alleviated by the proposed method.  Therefore, only the first term is of potential use. But here, the value-add term is just assumed to have some worst-case fixed upper bound \"C_{WREG}\" and the denominator is the sum of the mixture weights \\Beta_{1:N}, which is often constrained to be equal to 1.0.  So I am not sure what useful information this bound conveys.\n\nFurther, the corollary in equation 6 puzzles me because it assumes that nature's densities p_i and q_i are paired in some fashion. But in actuality there is no guarantee that nature will swap q_i for p_i; it could instead swap q_j with p_j. And therefore a double sum seems more appropriate:\n\n       \\sqrt{ 2 logK  +  K \\sum_{ij} \\pi_i \\tau_j D(p_i || q_j) }.\n\nFinally regarding the empirical results, I have two concerns:\n\ni) In experiments on KuaiRecs (the real-world dataset), AdaO2B shows no benefit over using a fully online (FOL) bandit. Therefore, I am not sure why one would use it, especially since it requires training constituent models online anyway.\n\nii) The experiments do not show comparisons against the baseline of training a single recommender system offline, directly on the logged bandit feedback. This baseline approach might work just as well as, or better than, the proposed adaptive mixture-of-bandits model. And it is the more obvious thing to try."
