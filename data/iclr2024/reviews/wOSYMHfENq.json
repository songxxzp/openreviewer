                "value": "This paper explores the role of normalization techniques, particularly Batch Normalization (BN), in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors provide a theoretical analysis to demonstrate that training normalization layers alone is adequate for universal function approximation, assuming a sufficient number of random features. This result applies to various CNN architectures, including those with or without residual connections and different activation functions, such as ReLUs. The authors also explain how this theory can elucidate the depth-width trade-off in network design and the empirical observation that disabling neurons can be beneficial."

                "value": "- In the introduction, I'm a bit confused about the normalization being explored in this paper. The title mentions batch normalization, but the statement \"we delve into the role of layer normalization\" suggests layer normalization. Is this a typo?\n\n- I'm puzzled by the assertion in Section 2 regarding the existence of $f_t$, which the author claims is due to the universal function approximation. Perhaps the author meant to refer to the Universal Approximation Theorem. However, such approximations in neural networks are typically conditional. Has the author considered these conditions? Generally, these conditions are not mild and are idealized. Does this affect the theory presented in this paper? The author should provide an explanation and discussion on this.\n\n- I'm not entirely sure why throughout the paper, normalization is reduced to just a linear transformation and shift, i.e., $\\gamma \\mathbf{h} + \\beta$. This includes batch norm, layer norm, instance norm, etc. They all have this form, so is their significance solely in the learnable parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$? Of course, I understand that $[(x - \\mu) / \\sigma] \\times \\gamma + \\beta$ can be equivalent to $\\gamma \\mathbf{h} + \\beta$\" in the end, but why emphasize batch normalization in the title? Where does \"batch\" come into play?\n\n- Can the analysis apply to the existing advanced batch normalization improvements like IEBN [1] and SwitchNorm [2]. These missing works should be considered and added to the related works or analysis.\n\n- The author needs to clarify the above questions. If these issues are addressed, I will consider these clarifications along with feedback from other reviewers in deciding whether to raise my score.\n\n\n[1] Instance Enhancement Batch Normalization: An Adaptive Regulator of Batch Noise, AAAI\n\n[2] Differentiable Learning-to-Normalize via Switchable Normalization, ICLR"

LN operates within a sample; the NN output does NOT change depending on input samples; during training this makes a NN with LN a function (not statistical).
