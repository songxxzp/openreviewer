Additionally, the authors introduce three supplementary loss functions to guarantee the desired behavior of the distillation process. To assess the efficacy of their method, they conduct experiments on four different datasets, covering two distinct tasks: movie recommendation and image classification. The results of these experiments demonstrate that this interactive distillation process can lead to performance enhancements."

For instance, [a], \n\n2. **Limited Tasks:** The paper only explores two specific tasks, which may not represent the full spectrum of potential applications for the proposed approach. Expanding the scope of evaluation to cover a broader range of tasks would provide a more robust assessment.\n\n3. **Insufficient Comparison with IAKD:** While the paper introduces a novel approach, it does not adequately differentiate it from Interactive Knowledge Distillation (IAKD). A clear comparison highlighting the advantages and distinctions between the proposed method and IAKD is needed to help readers understand the contribution.\n\n4. **Underwhelming Performance:** The reported performance metrics, such as RMSE and accuracy in Table 3 and 4, do not appear to be competitive when compared to state-of-the-art results. The ablation study also suggests that the new losses (L_MC and L_SC) do not significantly improve performance. For more up-to-date results on the datasets, it is recommended to refer to sources like [RMSE on ML100k](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/collaborative-filtering-on-movielens-100k) and [Cifar-10](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-cifar-10) to provide a clearer context for your results.\n\nAddressing these issues will help strengthen the paper and provide a more comprehensive and competitive assessment of the proposed approach.\n\n[a] Radhakrishnan, Adityanarayanan, et al. \"Transfer learning with kernel methods.\" Nature Communications 14.1 (2023): 5570."

                "value": "1. The idea seems novel and interesting, but direct evidence is lacked to support its advantages. The analogy of personal communication, though also interesting, is not enough to explain why the proposed method works. We know that the two models are interacting with each other, but with the concrete communication method, it is hard to say that they are actually \"talking\" to each other like two persons as hypothesized in Introduction. We actually don't know why the proposed method works. In fact, it is hard to understand the rational of the three proposed loss L_{interact}, L_{MC} and L_{SC}. For example, why should the messages of the teacher and the student be consistent (L_{MC}), considering that they are produced by the two models sequentially? \n\nIn addition, the two additional encoders and two additional decoders can account for most unaligned factors governed by the last three terms in the last equation in page 7 because these four modules are learnable. Then how much internal knowledge of the teacher model could be transferred to the student model by modifying its parameters?  \n\nI doubt that the performance improvement largely comes from the four additional modules as they bring more parameters. A desirable baseline approach for comparison is a knowledge distillation method (such as the one illustrated in Fig 1 left) with some additional modules (e.g., adding some modules between the student and teacher). \n\n2. The experiments are not enough to support the advantage of the proposed method. The compared methods are quite old. It is stated that: Note that most recent KD approaches (such as Beyer et al. (2022), Yang et al. (2022a)) focus on one single application such\nas image classification or recommendation, and assume teacher and student share similar tasks. This does not make much sense because the authors could compare with those recent approaches on (same) single applications individually.\n\n3. The presentation is poor. The paper introduces too many notations without a clear rule, in other words, the notations seem to be introduced in an arbitrary manner. For example, the subscripts g and h are used to indicate the student and the teacher, respectively. But in other places, h is used to indicate higher hidden layers of a neural network. This leads to weird notations such as H_{h_{h}}^h, a total of four h's! It is hard to get the meaning of a notation by looking at it. I spent a difficult time in reading the paper. In my opinion, many notations and equations are actually unnecessary. The proposed method is simple, and there is really no need to use such a complicated and tedious manner to describe it. \n\n4. Some technical details are missing. For example, each iteration between the teacher and the student will result in three additional losses (the last three terms in the last equation in page 7). Then with N iterations, does it mean that we need add 3N additional losses? If yes, how should we set the weighting factors? For another example, the method part introduces an encoder-decoder pair for both student and teacher, but in Appendix, only two modules are described. Is the encoder-decoder pair shared by the teacher and the student?"
