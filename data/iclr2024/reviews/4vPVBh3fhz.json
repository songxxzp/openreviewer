This implies that we cannot assign it to any class and should consider it an outlier. I'm curious if the proposed method can serve a similar purpose in outlier detection.\n- On Pages 8-9: Why are the sample sizes for the CIFAR-10 and AGNews experiments different between the \"large shift\" and \"small shift\" scenarios?\n- How did you determine the number of iterations, $t$? In section 3, it seems $t$ should be $\\[K-1\\]$. However, in the empirical studies, \n$t$ appears to range from 10,000 to 20,000, even for binary classification problems. Also, does this imply a significant computational cost?\n- In Figure 5, you've replaced \"PS-W\" (the proposed method) with \"Ora\".

In many tables, certain models get better prediction set error, but the prediction set size can be worse, and vice-versa. It would be better to compare the performance of all methods using one metric. A proper scoring rule is a standard method to evaluate the quality of predictive forecasts."
