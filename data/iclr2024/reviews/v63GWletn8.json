The sampling distribution is log-concave and specified by a Lipschitz/smooth function $f$. By using a pipeline introduced in [LLV20], they show how to speed up the algorithm introduced in [MV23] so that each iteration, instead of computing the Hessian of log-barrier using fast matrix multiplication, one can resort to the inverse maintenance data structure due to [LS15]. To this end, they achieve a similar per iteration cost as [LLV20], namely $\\mathrm{nnz}(A)+d^2$."

While this paper only mentions [LLV20] sparingly, the algorithmic framework is almost identical. Specifically, [LLV20] shows that for sampling uniformly over a polytope with log-barrier, one can use the [LS15] inverse maintenance to compute a new sampling point. The determinant ratio term can be estimated via an unbiased estimator, which can further be estimated using Taylor expansion together with terms that can be quickly computed using the inverse maintenance data structure. The only difference is that this paper also needs to handle the regularization term, but it is neither surprising nor novel the machinery of [LLV20] also works here. \n\nIt is worth noting that [LLV20] does not provide any proof on why using an approximate solver and samples, the algorithm still converges. This paper provides a very simple argument to show it indeed works.\n\nOverall, I think this paper should provide comprehensive comparison with algorithm in [LLV20]. What's the difference here? What's new? Otherwise, it should acknowledge that the algorithm is largely derivative from [LLV20]. In its current writing, the authors acknowledge the fast linear solver part follows from [LLV20]. What about the determinant ratio part? What's the main difference between your approach for determinant and [LLV20]? What's the novelty of your algorithm?"

In particular, they implement a more optimized version of the algorithm proposed by Mangoubi and Vishnoi [1], which is to appear in NeurIPS 2023, the arXiv version of which has been around for more than a year at this point. It is important to understand what [1] does, as the current paper heavily builds on it... \n\nThe algorithms considered in these papers are Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, which are a subclass of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. For each step of the Markov chain, [1] needs time $O(md^{\\omega-1})$ as it involves some matrix inversion and determinant computation steps, which can all be done in $O(md^{\\omega-1})$ time by using algorithms for these problems which work for arbitrary matrices. The main claim in the current paper is that instead of recomputing these matrix operations from scratch in every step of the Markov chain, we can use the information from the previous step to speed up the computations of the current step.\n\nReferences:\n\n1: Sampling from Log-Concave Distributions over Polytopes via a Soft-Threshold Dikin Walk, Mangoubi, Oren and Vishnoi, Nisheeth K, arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.09384.

I re-read this paper after reading [1] and it was much clearer the second time. It might have to do with space-constraints, as the arXiv version of [1] obviously has more space so can go over a lot of things in more detail...\n\nQuality: Overall seems to be of good quality. But I have not checked the correctness of the technical details. As it builds quite heavily on [1] and also a bunch of other results which I am not familiar with, I don't have the expertise to ascertain the correctness of the paper. But at least on the surface, it does seem like there are no major technical issues."

In this paper, the author improves the cost per iteration to $O^*(nnz(A)+d^2)$. This result directly answers the open problem proposed in [Lee-Sidford15, FOCS'15] which asks whether one can achieve such running time for the case $f\\equiv 0$. To achieve this, the authors make use of the inverse maintenance technique in  [Lee-Sidford15, FOCS'15] and show one can compute the estimation of determinant to high accuracy by cleverly constructing an unbiased estimator and making use of the linear system solver as a primitive."
