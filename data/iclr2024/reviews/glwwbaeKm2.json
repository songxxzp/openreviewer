By further mapping the two evaluation metrics into splitting parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, the paper provides a unified solution to enable cross-scope comparison between real and synthesized datasets.\n\nEmpirical experiments are conducted on 2 real VFL datasets and 7 centralized datasets.

Evaluating VFL algorithms across different levels of feature distribution contributes to understanding the distribution feasibility of a proposed method. In HFL, using the Dirichlet distribution to simulate various Non-IID levels has already become a consensus and common tool in HFL algorithm evaluation. It's happy to see this paper provides an effective tool for VFL to achieve a similar purpose. This would be helpful in forming a more fair and comprehensive standard in benchmarking VFL methods.\n- **Effectiveness of the Method is Mostly Supported**: The basic purposes of Party Importance and Party Correlation are well-achieved as shown in Figures 2, 3, and 4. The splitting method shows ideal results as expected. Besides, the importance splitting method has a good theoretical guarantee. It shows promise to become a commonly utilized tool in future VFL research, thereby making a significant impact.\n- **Sufficient Benchmark of Major VFL Method Type**: This is the first work comparing three different classes of VFL methods (AL-based, NN-based, and Tree-based), providing insights from a broader view. The experiments are conducted on sufficient datasets with various settings. The appendix provides very detailed additional results, and the splitting method used in the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets is much more reasonable than that in previous works (left-right image half split)."

A rough or intuitive relationship would be better to explain such a choice (e.g., the independent assumption is more concise and sufficient for evaluating most cases, or explain why it is so hard to capture their correlation). Since there are two metrics representing feature diversity, it can be confusing to determine which one to use, which one is better suited in specific cases, and whether it is possible and reasonable to evaluate a specific method in a 2D grid of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. \n- **Seemingly Case-Restricted Significance**: As shown in Figure 5, only C-VFL reflects a significant response to the variation of feature diversity, and all other methods perform consistently robust on all datasets. It seems like there are some specific reasons tailored to C-VFL that cause this observation, and further, **it makes me doubt whether it is meaningful to conduct such feature diversity evaluation for non-compression-based VFL methods**. This may largely reduce the potential impact of this work. Besides, as shown in the right part of Figure 7, the performance rank of GAL observed on synthetic datasets is different from real ones and shows significantly low performance.

Although it is not necessary to evaluate all these methods, a comprehensive literature review is usually beneficial for a benchmark paper to be solid.

Rather than expanding the scope to what may be nearly impossible in practice, it might be more appropriate to delve deeper into the real-world scope. While I recognize that Section 4.5 includes experiments to demonstrate the relationship between synthetic and real-world VFL datasets, further clarification is needed on how to interpret the findings from Figure 7 to better understand the implications of the results.\n\n2. Section 2.3 discusses various party correlation metrics, with the paper employing Spearman rank correlation in Algorithm 1. It would be beneficial to explore whether Spearman rank correlation can be replaced by the other mentioned correlations and, if possible, provide a comparison of their performance. This comparison would enhance the understanding of the selected correlation metric's effectiveness.\n\n3. Figure 5 indicates that three out of four VFL baselines are minimally impacted by alpha and beta. This raises questions about the rationale for partitioning the dataset based on feature importance and party correlation. It prompts further consideration of whether the proposed VFL dataset synthesis approach may overemphasize expanding the scope to an extent that may not reflect practical scenarios. Clarifying the reasoning behind these observations is crucial.\n\n4. The paper discusses the communication efficiency of VFL algorithms, which seems to be minimally impacted by data distribution. Given this, it might be more appropriate to allocate more space to extending the experiments in Section 4.5.

It\u2019s not clear to me why the metric Pcor is defined as roughly speaking (upto an additional $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}$ constant) the standard deviation of the correlation matrix\u2019s singular values. Consider a case where $m_i = m_j$ and the two parties have exactly the same set of features $X_i = X_j$ where the column features of $X_i$ are pairwise independent. In this case, the correlation matrix is the identity matrix $\\textrm{cor}(X_i, X_j) = I_{m_i \\times m_i}$ with singular values all being $1$. Then under the metric Pcor, these two parties' features would have 0 \u201ccorrelation\u201d because the singular values have zero variance while in reality there is indeed a somewhat strong notion of correlation (their features are identical). I would appreciate if the authors can provide an explanation of the reasoning in choosing this new metric and whether my suggested scenario would indeed be measured as having 0 \u201ccorrelation\u201d using pcor.\n\n- **Exploring the performance variations of feature partitioning under the same $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$**. For party balance using $(\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_K)$, the feature partitioning procedure (algorithm 5) has internal randomness, thus making two runs of the same algorithm produce feature partitions that are likely different. In this case, I would expect to see some results on the performance distribution of the same split learning method over these different feature splits and understand how much variation there is. Similarly, I\u2019m not sure if the argmin step (line 6) of Algorithm 1 could also yield multiple different solutions. If so, I think the authors should also explore the performances variation over these different partitions. Taking one step further, I wonder if there are algorithm ranking differences for the same $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ but different feature partition realizations. If there are such ranking differences, then the authors should provide more detailed suggestions on how to use their benchmark (how many such splits should be used/averaged for such comparison). If there aren\u2019t, I suggest the authors provide official splits after performing the sampling/optimization themselves so that future papers using these evaluation benchmarks would have a consistent comparable reporting.\n\n- __Proposition 1__ can be trivially proved through taking logarithm of both sides of a telescoping product equality: $\\frac{\\mathcal{P}(y | X_K, \\ldots, X_1)}{\\mathcal{P}(y)} = \\prod_{k=1}^K \\frac{\\mathcal{P}(y | X_k, \\ldots, X_1)}{\\mathcal{P}(y | X_{k-1}, \\ldots, X_1)}$. However it\u2019s not clear to me whether this likelihood ratio quantity really has deep connections to Shapley or the feature correlations, or is simply used as a heuristic quantity to motivate the story of feature balance and correlation.\n\n- **Figure 2, 3, 4.** I appreciate the authors including Figure 2, 3, 4 in the paper. However, I believe they are basic sanity checks of the correctness of Theorem 1 and the correctness of the implementation of Algorithm 1, and do not provide additional new insights. I believe they should instead be put into the Appendix.\n\n- __Communication efficiency__ Section 4.4 seems detached from the rest of the paper, as they do not explore in the axes of party balance ($\\alpha$) and party correlation ($\\beta$) explored in the rest of the paper.\n\n- Minor typos: In Equation 1, the index should be $k$ instead of $i$. In Algorithm 5 (line 4), the $\\cup$ should be $\\cap$."

                "value": "- Can the authors provide further discussion of the scalability of their two partitioning methods? For example, how scalable is the computation of Shapley values used in the experiments (run-time as a function of the number of features)? How many partition dimensions can the optimization method BRKGA efficiently solve?\n- Minor: Should the probablity $p_k$ (three lines above Theorem 1) be $r_k$?"
