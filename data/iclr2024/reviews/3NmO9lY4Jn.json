Initially, they illustrate that Tweedie's denoising formula tends to generate the majority of samples, which lie in high-density regions of the manifold. Building upon this, they devise the minority score to quantify the uniqueness of the features of a given data instance. Drawing inspiration from classifier guidance, they incorporate minority guidance into the diffusion model to generate samples in low-density regions."

In Fig. 1(a), what perturbation timestep was used to generate the noise samples displayed in the middle, 0.9T or T?

In the experimental section, the method proposed in this paper did not achieve satisfactory results in terms of both prec and rec. The authors should provide further explanations.\n5.

Data with larger such score is used to train a auxiliary classifier, which is used to guide the generation with commonly used classifier-guidance approach. Substantial theoretical and empirical results are shown to demonstrate the superiority, especially quantitative, of the proposed method."

It is a neat combination of straightforward ideas that produces good results: identifying uniqueness with distance between clean and denoised data, marking the data points that are showing minority data, and training a classifier of minority data to guide the generation. \n\nParticularly, the problem of generating samples belonging to the minority part of the data domain is an interesting one with potential applications. Components in the proposed work are existing ideas (Tweedie\u2019s formula inspired deonsing, training auxiliary classifier to guide the inference process), but the quantitative quality are consistent and should give readers some insights. Furthermore I\u2019d like to praise the authors for detailed explanation of the method, theories behind and extra examples in appendix.\n\nHowever there are some issues (see weaknesses and questions below) in the manuscript. Overall my assessment of this manuscript is borderline, but if my concerns are addressed I\u2019m happy to adjust accordingly."

This may not be a issue on its own as long as the work presents an interesting approach in the whole, but a few missing details hurts, as follows:\n\nIt is unclear how the minority classifier guidance plays with other classifier guidance or classifier-free guidance. From an application perspective, it\u2019s important that users can control the generation through guidance, and a mere generation of minority data, while still being useful for say data augmentation, may limit its value for the end-user if the user cannot control the generation effectively. However, now only in Appendix E some examples are shown for conditional generation and details/quantitative evaluates are omitted. This makes it hard to assess the broader impact of this work.\n\nAlso, it would be better to discuss the rationale behind minority score \u2014 the exact motivation of having a minority data generation remains not elaborated."
