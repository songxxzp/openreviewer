This paper assumes the samples are pairs of features and labels \\{(x, y)\\}, and studies how to protect the privacy of the labels. The server is assumed to provide two API functions. The first is a forward function that returns activations ($h$). After receiving the activations, users compute the loss ($l$) by themselves and send $\\partial l/\\partial h$ to the server. The server then use the second backward API function that uses $\\partial l/\\partial h$ to do backpropagation to compute the gradients. The authors propose two empirical ways to prevent the server from inferring the labels from activations and gradients. Unfortunately, I have several concerns regarding the protection effectiveness."

Because they are also regarded as solutions to preserving labels. There should be at least some discussion on telling the readers what the advantages of the proposed method are over these existing strategies. \n2.\tFollowing 1, with access to the full features of target domain, this work is also related to source-free domain adaptation. I understand the applied loss takes label in this work and thus should be more informative than UDA. It would be better if the necessity of using labels could be clarified.\n3.\tThere is not much referring to the \u201clocal layers\u201d in Fig. 1. Are these layers learnable or fixed? Can you explain why it is rational to be learnable/fixed for clients in real scenarios?\n4.\tWhen taking about fine-tuning APIs in the paragraph 3-4, I think some recent works are missing, especially from the privacy preserving motivation.\n\n       [1] Earning Extra Performance from Restrictive Feedbacks, 2023\n       [2] Offsite-Tuning: Transfer Learning without Full Model, 2023\n\n5.\tFrom my understanding, the technique on gradient privacy preserving is based on zero-order optimization and the random weights for activation is like a code book maintained locally. Can you explain what the differences/novelties are compared to previous work in terms of the two techniques?\n6.\tIf an adversary knows how $ z$ is sampled and $g_h$ could be exposed via sum even the norm of $z$ is large.

                "value": "My main concern is that the description of the proposed method is confusing and missing lots of information. Figure 2 (which is supposed to be a visualisation of the proposed framework) makes it even more confusing by introducing new variables that were never used in the description. I have spent some time trying to understand and guess the missing information. See below my understanding of the proposed method: \n1) a client has local adapters and initializes them locally. How this initialization is done? I can think of two scenarios: 1) the initialization is done randomly; or 2) the initialization is done by copying the weights of adapters owned by the server. Scenario 2 does not make sense because this paper discusses that servers do not want to send their model to clients. Scenario 1 does not make sense either as in step 5 clients use the gradients w.r.t. the server adapter parameters.\n2) a client calls forward API call to compute features on each mini-batch of their data. It is not clear how these features are computed. I can think of three different scenarios: 1) the server has both pre-trained model and adapters so the server computes these features as the summation of the output of both of these modules' 2) the server uses only the pre-trained model to compute these features; or 3) the server uses only the adapters to compute these features. \n2) a client passes these features to the local \u201chead\u201d and computes task-specific loss function. What is this task-specific loss function?\n3) a client computes gradients of the task-specific loss function w.r.t. local head inputs\n4) a client passes those gradients to a server via backward API call to compute gradients w.r.t. adapter parameters.\n5) a client updates both local adapter parameters and local head parameters. How and which adapters parameters are updated? Please see my points in step 1.\n\nApart from the above main concern, I have other concerns:\n\n1- Overclaims: \n1) This paper claims \"privacy guarantees\" by saying that \"designing a two-party fine-tuning protocol that performs standard parameter-efficient fine-tuning with privacy guarantees\". However, there are no privacy guarantees provided, the privacy promise of this paper is ad-hoc and it is just based on increasing the number of servers, assuming they do not collude but assuming that they have the same model.\n2) The title of this paper \"PRIVACY-PRESERVING LLM FINE-TUNING OVER API\" is too generic, oversell and does not represent this work that only considers the privacy of labels.\n3) Where \"lower performance overhead\" is demonstrated \"This paper proposes P3EFT, a two-party split learning algorithm that takes advantage of existing PEFT properties to maintain privacy at a lower performance overhead\".\n\n2- The observation listed as one of the main contributions at the end of the introduction section (\"We observe that, despite fine-tuning less than 0.1% of model parameters, modern PEFT algorithms leak client\u2019s training labels against simple attacks that work for modern pretrained transformers\")  and its corresponding Figure 1, has been already demonstrated in existing works such as  Li et al. (2022) even in a more generic way as opposed to simple binary classification tasks that considered in this submission. \n\n3- Not self-contained. For example, a clear description of LoRA which is the main building block of the proposed framework is missing. \n\n4- Not clear what would be the novelty of the proposed privacy-preserving backpropagation in comparison to secret sharing in 2 party computation that have been heavily studied in the literature."
