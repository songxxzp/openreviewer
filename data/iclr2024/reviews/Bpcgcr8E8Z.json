The conditional probability function is naturally parallelized by autoregressive models and this value should naturally be close to a local maximum for a model that generated a given text. The connection to likelihood and entropy was also interesting.\n\nThe experimental results are strong and comprehensive. Fast-DetectGPT is faster than DetectGPT by over two orders of magnitude due to its parallelization and also shows performance gains across six datasets. Even in the black-box (surrogate) evaluation setting, DetectGPT achieves impressively high recall at low false positive rates. It also shows qualitatively better behavior than DetectGPT on longer passages, where quirks of T5 masking cause DetectGPT to start underperforming as sequence length increases beyond a point."

While this connection is nice, I think the paper could be stronger if it analyzed each term in (7) in isolation to see what is most contributing to increased performance and why. Both likelihood and entropy are points of comparison in the result tables, but they do not perform as well; does their sum perform well? If not, and the denominator in (7) plays a key role, what probabilistic interpretation does that have, and what does that imply about the log_p surfaces of LLMs?\n\nNot really a weakness and perhaps out of scope for this submission, but I'd be interested in knowing how Fast-DetectGPT would work for very long passages, given that it scales favorably with passage length."

In particular, while the proposed method is described as a more efficient alternative to DetectGPT, its approach of computing the difference between the conditional probabilities of words and their alternatives is more similar to likelihood-based (Solaiman et al. 2019) or rank-based (GLTR; Gehrmann et al. 2019) approaches. Framing the method as a 340x speedup over DetectGPT therefore does not seem appropriate, although the method does seem to outperform existing zero-shot approaches. The sampling step in Fast-DetectGPT is also not clearly motivated and straightforwardly approximates an expected difference, so IMO the derivation could just immediately be replaced by the analytical solution. \n\nThe paper also includes supervised RoBERTa baselines from OpenAI; however, these are not state-of-the-art for supervised detection. I believe the paper would be strengthened by comparison to state-of-the-art supervised methods, such as Ghostbuster (Verma et al. 2023) or GPTZero (commercial model), especially given the claims in Section 5 that supervised methods have limited generalization capabilities in LLM-generated text detection. Because the primary purpose of the paper is to evaluate and compare zero-shot methods, however, this does not affect my score or recommendation for the paper.\n\nMinor notes:\n- The paper mentions both Rank and LogRank baselines in Section 3.1 but only provides LogRank in tables"

Liang et al. 2023 has shown that LLM detection systems tend to exhibit higher false positive rates for non-native speakers. While this doesn\u2019t invalidate the usefulness of this work, at the least it is worth engaging with that literature and acknowledging the potential problems at play with this task.
