What is the quality of the reconstruction? Is this related to the searched model's performance? \n3. Are there any conducted ablations about different levels of reconstruction losses, and what is their impact on the models searched?\nWhat is the most influential factor in finding a better architecture using MAE-NAS?\n\nA good showcase example of the above questions is \"Are Labels Necessary for Neural Architecture Search?\" (see Fig.2~5),  and I believe more comparisons about this paper's method should be conducted to show differences and superiority. Otherwise, from Table 4, the conclusion can be too simple and lack insights. \n\nAlso, while the current test was apparently done on small-scale data, one of the key advantages of unsupervised methods is the ability to scale up learning on a much larger scale without human annotations.
