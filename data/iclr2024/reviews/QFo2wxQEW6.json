CathSim is used to generate semantic segmentations of guidewires, joint position, joint velocity, top camera images that are fed into a learning algorithm (CNN+MLP) to provide inputs into a reinforcement learning algorithm (soft actor critic) to predict desired catheter positions (this system is referred to as expert navigation network (ENN)). \nENN is evaluated on whether it can learn to imitate expert trajectories (imitation learning) and predict force. Various quantitative and qualitative results are provided:\n\n* Authors demonstrate that force distributions between real robots and CatSim simulation are nearly identically using hypothesis testing (p-value analysis).\n* User study assessing CatSim realism and user satisfaction is provided. \n* Evaluation of trajectory planning, where two trajectories are compared: the first is generated by   a human expert using CatSim and the second is generated using ENN (automatic). Results show that ENN is competitive to human, using less force, shortest path, least episode length. Human output is safer. Also, ENN can use multimodal inputs (image, joints) while human relies only on images to perform trajectory planning. An ablation study with type of inputs is included.\n* Evaluation of whether ENN can imitate the human annotated trajectory (with respect to five considered metrics, Table 5) with an ablation study."

Authors should discuss the importance of generating simulated images, relationship to other generative methods (e.g., purely DL based approaches that may not capture underlying physics), and most importantly, why is the approach important to ML. \n\nBelow are some section specific weaknesses. \n\n**Methodology**\n* It is not clear what is a guidewire and what is its purpose. \n* Not clear how force labels are extracted from CatSim outputs, which seems to be images + joint position info (as discussed in Section 4.1).\n* In Section 4.1, authors mention that the output is a feature vector Z, but it is unclear how it is used afterwards.\n\n**Manuscript Organization**\n\nStatement such as \u201cOther aspects of our simulator such as blood simulation and AR/VR are designed for surgical training and, hence are not discussed in this paper\u201d indicate that blood simulation information is not critical to be include in the main manuscript, yet there is a section on blood simulation in Section 3. \n\nOn the other hand, more information about the number of labelled training samples would be helpful (e.g., in Section 4, where authors state \u201cvast amount of labeled training samples\u201d but do not provide additional details). \n\nMinor point: there is a typo in contribution 1: \u201cand AR/VR ready\u201d -> \u201cand is AR/VR ready\u201d.\n\n**Results**\n\nBCA and LCCA are not defined. \n\nAuthors state that they conducted a user study evaluating user satisfaction and realism of CatSim (Supplementary G, and main page 6,7) and report answers to questions, but do not include a scale for responses. In addition, it would help if the authors split user study questions by type (realism and satisfaction), so it is easier to interpret results. \nTable 4 and 5 include various types of inputs (Image, Mask, Internal, Human).

I would expect real-world images are highly diverse than rendering images that has clean background, unified rendering parameters, and a fixed camera position. I don't think the propose ENN really showed the importance of the work.\n3. I am not sure why the authors skipped AR/VR and blood simulation parts in the experiment section but still claim the contribution of them in the table. I have a feeling that these contributions are not grounded.\n4. My main reservation is the contribution. The manuscript mainly created a new environment based on MuJoCo and only showed the effectiveness of the simulator in simulated tasks with rendered inputs.
