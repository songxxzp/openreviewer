Specifically, the study introduces a Bayesian approach called BOORL, where the dataset is treated as priors and online interactions are utilized to update posteriors. By sampling actions from these posteriors, this method effectively avoids excessive optimism or pessimism in off-to-on settings. Experimental results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that BOORL outperforms other baseline methods."

Some details are left out and some indication of the theory results could be better explained. For example, the theory algorithm that is used to give the results in Thm 3.2 (and generate the results of Fig. 2) is not given so it is a little bit hard to contextualize the results. Is the algorithm running TS-LCB in the offline stage and switch to TS in the online stage? \n\n2. From my understanding, the proposition 3.3 is trying to argue that using UCB in online stage will cause the performance drop? I am not sure that one-step suboptimality corresponds exactly to the \"performance drop\".\n\n3. It would be helpful is any explanation why TS is performing better than theory in Fig. 2. \n\n4. At the ending remark of the theory section, the paper mentions that [Song et al., 2022] benefits only when offline data has sufficient coverage, but to my best knowledge it seems that [Song et al., 2022] indeed requires and benefit from sufficient coverage from offline data. So to my understanding the current paper is achieving a best-of-both-world (kind of, not exactly) results of [Xie et al, 2021] and [Song et al., 2022]. \n\n5. The current coverage is not the tightest in the linear case. Is the tightest coverage (as in [1]) applicable in the current analysis?\n\n6. Some indexing on $h$ seems to be off in eq 3. Also in eq 4, are the linear features not $h$-dependent?\n\n### References\n[1] Zanette, Andrea, Martin J.
