After all, the training and testing data are the same. \n-- For the learned cardinality estimator, the absolute error is not what people are using for evaluation -- q-error is. This is because for a true cardinality of 10K, an error of 100 is more acceptable than an error of 10 for a true cardinality of 10.\n\n2. When people study learned db operators, the main advantage is that the model can adapt to the underlying data and hence derive instance-optimal solutions. However, this paper is studying the worst-case/average scenario, which contradicts to the motivation of using learned model to be instance-optimal.\n\n3. It would be great to show more implications of this theoretical results and how can we make use of this theoretical results in practice. It is now unclear. The result shown in Figure 1 does not provide actional items for users. In particular, it seems that different models are having similar average-case lower bounds in terms of error -- which is not quite differentiable."

In the latter case, where the model size is fixed ahead of time and the error is determined during training, the author's bounds can be used to estimate an initial model size from the desired error, or to compute an estimate of the error from the size of the model. Interestingly, the authors show that the domain size is relevant for worse case behavior but not for average case behavior."

Nor is it clear to me how to use these bounds to estimate the error of a fixed-size structure. Further, the authors fall short of actually *constructing* either (1) a dataset of size `n` and domain size `u` for which a particular index cannot achieve an error better than `e` for a given size, or (2) a index structure that can actually achieve the given error bounds at the specified size.\n\nThat said, this paper is still a useful contribution for practitioners like me! Using the worst-case error bounds for indexing given in table 1, setting n=200M, u=2^32, e = 8, I get sizes remarkably close to the exhaustive search performed by the cited learned index papers (7MB). So, even if these bounds are not exactly what database folks need, they appear to be a useful heuristic."

Unfortunately, I do not have the required background to parse the appendices. As far as I can tell, the authors assume that a learned structure can, at most, represent 2^n different functions of bitstrings. The authors show an isomorphism between bitstring functions and learned indexing, and then assert that, since only 2^n bitstring functions can be covered, any database admitting more than 2^n values must have at least imperfect prediction. From there, the authors work through to the error bound. I would love to know more!\n\nQ3) A note on error functions: learned index structures today generally care about log-loss (i.e., the average log2 of the absolute differences), since this is the number of binary search steps one will need for the \"last mile\" search. \n\nQ4) typo A.1 \"on the notions of the notions of\""
