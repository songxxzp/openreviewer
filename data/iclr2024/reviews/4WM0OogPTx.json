The cited paper seems to be about DICE and not about regularization methods. Additionally, IQL (which is a baseline considered in the paper) uses the same hyperparameters for experiments in the same domain, just like the proposed method.\n- The considered tasks are not thorough. First, there are no experiment results on D4RL Gym *-medium-replay datasets, which contain trajectories that vary significantly in performance. These datasets can test if the proposed method can handle datasets with mixed quality. Second, on Adroit, I am curious on why the authors did not include the *-cloned datasets while including *-human datasets. Third, some important tasks with sparse reward are missing: Antmaze and Kitchen. These tasks are much harder than simple maze2d and at the same time have sparse rewards.\n- Some important baselines are missing. To name a few, DecisionTransformer [1] and Diffuser [2] also claim they have strength in the sparse reward settings.\n\n[1] Chen et al., Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling, NeurIPS 2021.\n\n[2] Janner et al., Planning with Diffusion for Flexible Behavior Synthesis, ICML 2022."

In DICE the state-action distribution is optimized in order to maximize the reward under that distribution subject to an f-divergence regularization between the visit distribution and the empirical distribution under observed data. In additiona this optimization problem is constrained such that the state-action visit distribution is a valid discounted distribution under the initial-state and transition model of the MRP. Where CDE departs from DICE is in introducing an additional constraint such that the state-action distribution function evaluated at any state-action is less than a multiplicative factor of epsilon of some alternative distribution mu defined to have support only over out-of-distribution actions, and where mu is restricted to have the same marginal state distribution as the empirical distribution. Given this formulation the state-action distribution can then be optimized and the policy implied by this distribution can be extracted from the distribution. Additionally the authors extend the f-divergence to include an f-divergence with an extended distribution which mixes the empirical and mu distribution which a trade-off factor.\n\nBased on these results the authors present some theoretical results bounding the importance ratio and bound the performance gap. The authors also provide a number of results on maze2d tasks and sparse mujoco tasks, predominantly showing that their method outperforms other comparable offline RL algorithms."
