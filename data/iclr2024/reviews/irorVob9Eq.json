While previous research has highlighted their compression capabilities, this paper aims to conduct a systematic and principled study to assess the interpretability properties of CapsNets, specifically examining the encoding of part-whole relationships within learned representations.\n\nTo evaluate interpretability, the authors analyze several capsule-based architectures using MNIST, SVHN, PASCAL-part, and CelebA datasets. The findings suggest that the representations encoded in CapsNets may not be as disentangled or strictly related to part-whole relationships as commonly claimed in the literature.\n\nThe contributions of the paper lie in conducting a thorough and rigorous investigation into the interpretability of CapsNets. By challenging the prevailing notion of highly disentangled representations and strict part-whole relationships, the authors provide valuable insights that facilitate a better understanding of the limitations and characteristics of CapsNets as interpretability-focused models."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Due to the fact that the authors consider multiple settings and configurations, some parts of the paper are not easy to read; some missing definitions and notation inconsistency further interrupt the flow. \n\nStarting with the definition of the first-order statistics in the perturbation analysis section, the authors introduce $A_c = [a_{1,c}^l, a_{2,c}^l, \\dots, a_{s,c}^l]$, where $A_c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{S' \\times A'}$. However: (i) $A_c$ seems to be layer-specific; omitting this breaks the flow of the paper, and (ii) at the same time, $S'$ and $A'$ are never defined. Is $S'$ the set of examples corresponding to class $c$? and what is $A'$? I would assume that $A' = w \\times h \\times d$, but it is never defined. \n\nIn a similar vein, why are the first order statistics again $\\in \\mathbb{R}^{S'\\times A'}$? Since a reduction takes places, the dimensionality should be different. The authors then introduce $A_{all} = [A_1;A_2;\\dots ; A_1^M] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times A'}$. I am assuming that $A_1^M$ is a typo that should be $A_M$. Again this is layer specific and misses the $l$ superscript (which appears in the $\\alpha$ definition afterwards). Does this matrix comprise the first order statistics or $A_c$ themselves? The authors define $A_{all}$ as the concatentation of the $A_c$ matrices, but note that this is composed of the first order statistics. In this context, wouldn't an $\\alpha$ value based only on $A_c$ make more sense for the sensitivity analysis? Different classes activate $v_j$ with different magnitudes; when an entry for one example is small and is altered with a $\\xi$ that is very larger, it can easily lead to massive changes in the reconstruction. I fully understand the need for a more principled definition of $A_c$; I am not $100$% certain that this formulation captures the subtle differences in the activations between the examples. What are the values that the other works consider?\n\nMoving on to the experimental section, for the perturbation analysis, I re-iterate my point about the magnitude of the perturbation. Even though the argument that the authors could easily hold, I am still concerned about the impact of the perturbation magnitude is the decoding process. Since the decoder it's not just a simple linear layer, a large change (compared to the original magnitudes of the vector) in the entry of vector $v_j$ can lead to misleading results. \n\nThe visualization in Fig. 2 is not clear, a description of what each color represents is important for understanding what is happening. \n\nFurther details are also necessary in the caption of Fig. 4. Without running back and forth to the relevant section, it is not clear what the different plots depict. What are the $D_0-D_9$ legends? I suppose they are the digits of the datasets. \n\nI can't see how the Relevance Mass Accuracy metric is an appropriate  proxy for measuring the part-whole relationship. This is a metric for measuring the spatial overlap between ground truth masks and a 2D positive valued image with a single channel.  How does this relate to heatmaps arising from spatially re-arranged responses of capsules is not clear to me. It is possible that I am missing the intuition and the formulation behind this construction. I could understand the approach for activation maps for convolutional maps but not for capsules. \n\nFigure 6 is not very clear. A more detailed caption can help clarify what each column depicts without the need to re-look at the text. \n\nThe authors note that \"Overall, the mean of RMA is lower than what was anticipated\". What was anticipated and how this conclusion was reached? Potentially this ties to the previous point. After the analysis, the authors themselves note that \"the observed low overlap may have its origin in other sources\". I personally don't find this particular analysis to be adequate to draw conclusions about the part-whole relationship of CapsNets. It may very well be true as the authors claim, but further investigation is needed."
