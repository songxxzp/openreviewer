The framework delves into utilizing interpretability but in an automated and scalable manner. They do this by collecting the neural network activations from the dataset, then identifying the directions in that space, and then quantifying the interpretability of the directions in that space. By doing this, they provide some metrics which are interpretability index (II) and maximally exciting images (MEI). They also use MEI and II to compare among other approaches. For instance, they apply II in a ResNet50 and compare against PCA, ICA, NMF, K-Means, and a sparse autoencoder to show why their approach is beneficial."

The index lacks theoretical motivation, and no empirical comparisons are made against alternative indices. While it makes sense that directions that produce perceptually similar MEIs are more interpretable, it is unclear whether this property captures human interpretability substantially. The more principled index of in silico accuracy is dismissed for being \"often saturated\" (a problem that can be solved by taking neural noise into account) and said to be expensive to compute, but the reasons for the high cost are not explained. Furthermore, the sole comparison to the human data (figure 2) provides no indication of the reliability bound of the human data (i.e., the \"noise ceiling\"). Therefore, we cannot estimate how good (or bad) the index is in capturing human judgments.\n\nSubsequent sections of the paper employ the proposed, yet insufficiently validated, index as a dependent measure. Since no further human experiments are conducted to empirically test the reported findings (e.g., greater interpretability of K-means directions), it remains unclear whether these results apply to human interpretability or solely to the proposed index.\n\nRegarding the presentation, the detail provided is insufficient for replicating the experiments.

The paper does not properly consider the literature on interpreting neurons in computer vision research. \n\nAnalyzing activations using highly activating images for interpreting CNNs has been around since the early work of Zeiler and Fergus [Zeiler, Matthew D., and Rob Fergus. \"Visualizing and understanding convolutional networks.\" Computer Vision\u2013ECCV 2014:]. More importantly, Network Dissection [Bau, D., Zhou, B., Khosla, A., Oliva, A., & Torralba, A. (2017). Network dissection: Quantifying interpretability of deep visual representations. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition] is ignored, where neuron activation alignment with various concepts is quantified. These works are among the cornerstone works that study the interpretability of neurons in cnns using highly activating images and are well established. Of course, I understand the minor differences in methodology and, in fact, appreciate them (also appreciate referring to work of Erhan and Yonsinski); however, failing to mention major relevant works in computer vision and only relying on recent mechanistic interpretability works in NLP would lead to community confusion and reinventing the wheel. We could list more papers trying to assign semantics to individual neurons following the many citations of these cornerstone works. This fact also reduces my trust in the authors, having done a comprehensive survey to identify if more similar work has already been done.\n\nMoreover, there are also influential works in computer vision on identifying meaningful directions in the latent space. These works are also motivated based on the fact that semantics are not encoded in individual neurons, and Elhage et al. (2023) is not the first work on this topic. The most famous one is perhaps T-CAV [Kim, Been, et al., \"Interpretability beyond feature attribution: Quantitative testing with concept activation vectors (tcav).\" International conference on machine learning. PMLR, 2018.] and a recent one is [Crabb\u00e9, Jonathan, and Mihaela van der Schaar. \"Concept activation regions: A generalized framework for concept-based explanations.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 2590-2607.]. \n\nThese are famous, relevant works, and I ask the authors not only to outline the differences in the rebuttal but to do a proper literature analysis of these works and their follow-ups to make the contributions clearer. I think the specific technical contributions can be useful to the community. However, they need to be clearly distinguished from existing established works. It also helps with the promotion and reception of the work.\n\n2. Although I appreciate the analysis in various experiments, the main findings are not novel. It was already known that analyzing individual neurons is a crude approximation, and they need to be considered in tandem (TCAV, Concept Activation Regions, and the works of Olah). The authors mention that the experiments confirm these findings (from Elhage et al), which I appreciate. However, the novelty of amajor finding is missing. Moreover, the interpretability of neurons and latent directions have been studied before (e.g. in TCAV, NetworkDissection and many following works). The authors are encouraged to highlight their contributions with respect to the literature properly.\n\n3. \"we focus the remainder of our analyses on layer 1 of the same ResNet50 architecture trained on CIFAR-10.\" It is quite a well-known phenomenon in cans that early layers are basic feature detectors (edges, colors, Haar-like features). The analysis will be more interesting if done on deep layers. Specifically, it is interesting to know if superposition occurs less or more in deeper features. I encourage the authors to increase the scale of their experiments and do more analysis, to make the work stronger.\n\n4. Although the metric shows whether the highly activating images are similar in terms of color or LPIPS, it does not reveal what the concept associated with the images is (except for the case of using the label). One can use existing literature to identify these concepts as well."
