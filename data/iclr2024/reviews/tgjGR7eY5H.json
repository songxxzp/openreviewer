While this paper is confined to the scope of RL4Routing, it implements various RL methods for these problems. However, at their core, these methods belong to the same category (and share very similar algorithm procedures), and there is a lack of insights to organize this category effectively. If this article could provide some useful conclusions or derive new methods based on these benchmarks, it would become novel.             \n3. Additionally, one cannot ignore the issue that, for example, in the case of TSP problems, many non-autoregressive (or non-RL) methods [1,2,3] have recently achieved better performance than RL-based, like faster inference time, lower optimal gap, and runnable on larger instances (TSP1000 and TSP10000). Therefore, as a benchmark for routing problems(TSP, CVRP, etc.), the comparison of methods is not comprehensive enough.\n\n\nAs a reviewer, I find myself in a dilemma regarding this paper. First and foremost, I acknowledge the substantial effort and contribution to the community. However, I have reservations about the completeness and rationality of the organization of RL4CO Lib, particularly with respect to the concerns raised above. Therefore,  I am still unsure whether it meets the standards of ICLR.    \n\n[1] Sun Z, Yang Y.

Though the authors claim that they aim to propose a unified framework, the methods considered in their paper are mainly based on AM and POMO, in other words, the auto-regressive methods. As far as I know, there are also other methods other than auto-regressive, such as Local-rewrite[1]. Instead of constructing the solution from scratch, methods like Local-rewrite aim to improve an existing solution. Are these kinds of methods able to integrate into the proposed RL4CO framework? \n2. The proposed unified framework mainly focuses on TSP/VRP and the graph-based CO problems. However, there are other kinds of CO such as bin-packing, job scheduling, and mixed integer programming. I wonder if the proposed RL4CO covers these CO problems.\n3. In the experiments, only three methods are considered as baselines. I think the authors should test more RL4CO methods as they claimed they propose a unified library. \n4. Still in the experiments, the size of TSP/VRP is only 50. I consider this size to be relatively small. \n\n\n[1] Chen, Xinyun, and Yuandong Tian. \"Learning to perform local rewriting for combinatorial optimization.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 32 (2019)."
