The authors first replicate a previous model for story generation (DOC) with open-source architectures and show challenges and fixes to overcome some of the challenges in the transition. Then, they use this model to create a large number of story plots that are then used to fine-tune another, 7B model for this task, showing competitive performance (according to GPT-4) with the teacher model. Finally, the authors collect human preferences from plots generated with the same premise and further tune the fine-tuned model with RLHF, resulting in better performance across 5 metrics (again, according to GPT-4)."

Relying solely on a model like GPT-4 for such a complex task is, in my opinion, a major limitation to the soundness of the claims. I hence invite the authors to pair the main evaluations (ie Table 5 and 6) with human evaluation. I will then happily advocate for acceptance.\n2. Another minor limitation is that RLHF results in 5 different models, which are each compared against a single SFT model. Could the authors consider combining the different rewards into a single RLHF model and then ask humans to compare it against SFT according to the metrics Q1-6?\n\n---\nRebuttal: The authors added human evaluation, and said that (2) is a direction for future work."

Yes, we can use a supervisedly finetuned model to replace repeated LLM calls. Yes, we can do RLHF. All these are common knowledge. Hence, it may seem that the paper does not make a real scientific contribution. It may be an interesting engineering effort, but may not qualify as a scientific publication. \n\nThe decision to use GPT-4 as the evalution for final story quality seems dubious. The paper has not offered any evidence that GPT-4 is good at the task. The paper makes the claim that the RLHF stories are better at suspense and surprise. However, do we know if GPT-4 is good at detecting suspense or surprise? \n\nSince the author has spent significant effort to collect human ratings on 7000 story pairs, why not do another 300 pairs? This would create a much more solid evaluation. \n\nHow is story generation different from other forms of structured text generation, such as poetry or argumentative essays? The paper has used specific prompts to handle aspects of stories such as characters or settings. But it is not explicit that if there is any principle behind the writing of these prompts or if they solely rely on trial and error by the paper authors. This goes back to the question: what is it that we can learn from this paper?\n\nMinor comments:\n\nSection 2.1.1 The authors do not define what is meant by \"supports suffix\". I managed to guess the meaning from the context but it created temporary confusion. \n\nThe authors make several claims about how humans supposedly do things. Humans write stories in a specific way (Page 2, Paragarph 2). Humans write from coarse to fine (Challenge 1). However, these claims are unsubstantiated."

The generator is based on on a two-level hierarchy (where DOC supports different numbers of levels for the hierarchical outline) and operates in a breadth-first and coarse-to-fine manner.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Although the paper describes generated units as 'plots' it stands in-between substantial previous work of Plan-based plot generation [Riedel and Young, 2010] where plot elements were narrative functions or operators and text-based story generation [Wang and Wan, 2019] (in the paper's references), originating in story completion experiments, up to systems to which the approach is compared that generate plot + narrative text [Yang et al., 2023 (2022a in the paper's references)]. It is thus unclear whether what is presented in the paper, in particular in Figure 7 are plots or storyboards, and this is not just a terminological issue, as it affects the ability to apply structural evaluation methods to plots (see below) as well as creating an unusual setting for users to 'evaluate' the plot as opposed to evaluation methods based on end-story quality or story understanding (e.g. QUEST graphs [Graesser et al., 1992] used in [Christian and Young, 2004]). \nIt would thus be necessary to much better justify the approach compared to end-story text generation (not just completion), or non-DL, non-LLM based plot generation (e.g. Plan-based).  In particular, considering that LLM text generation could be used in conjunction to other plot/backbone generation methods, or that the DOC method is in reality generating both plot and (textual) narrative. \n\nRegarding reward models, there should probably be a discussion of previous approaches in text-based narrative generation, for instance [Ammanabrolu et al., 2019] and [Castricato et al., 2022]. There is also a lack of details on how RLHF has actually been performed (no details in the supplementary materials). \n\nEvaluation techniques are somehow underspecified considering previous work in evaluating narrative generation. The expression of comparative preferences by GPT4 is moderately replicable and appears rather qualitative and not sufficiently related to structural properties of the plot and rigorous definitions of the above properties. \nAlthough most of the work on evaluation based on narrative criteria (suspense, surprise, narrative arc...) has been developed as part of Plan-based narrative generation [Bae and Young, 2013] [Doust and Piwek, 2017] it should be transposable to DL-based (text-based [Yao et al., 2019] - in the paper's references, plot backbone [Polceanu et al., 2021]) or LLM-based work. Visual aspects of Plot structures that reconstruct Aristotelian arcs are of particular interest [Leong et al., 2022], not least because the paper makes reference [Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2020] to similar principles for neural-based story generation. In the absence of formal models it seems difficult to rely on GPT-4 with generic evaluation prompts, meaning that plots or storyboards would be better evaluated by industry professionals [Mirowski et al., 2022] (in the paper's references). \nOther related work is not discussed [Xie et al., 2023], although it may have been released too late considering the ICLR deadline.\n\nAmmanabrolu, P., Tien, E., Cheung, W., Luo, Z., Ma, W., Martin, L. and Riedl, M., 2019, August.
