                "value": "Despite the method is easy-to-follow, I believe there are many room for improvement in improving the proposed method:\n- Motivation: It is unclear how the mode collapse is related to the Janus problem. In specific, what is the precise definition of mode collapse in text-to-3D generation? In the general context, I believe the term mode collapse is used for the inability of the generative model to generate diverse output in distribution-level. However, it seems like the paper considers a problem in generating a single 3D content. Thus, it will be clearer if the paper considers the mode collapse problem of certain prompts and aims to alleviate the issue, or aims to handle the widespread mode collapse problem of text-to-3D generation. In such a case, how to measure the mode collapse problem in text-to-3D generation? I think the Inception score alone cannot faithfully correlate to the mode collapse problem. \ngenerating a single instance, which is not  Is the term mode collapse is used as the 2D diffusion model generates multiple facet in single 3D generation author \n- Method: While I believe the entropic regularization is somewhat new to the text-to-3D generation research, but it seems like it is just a classifier-free guidance training of LoRA parameters in VSD, which is already in part suggested from the Threestudio, which has an open-source re-implementation of ProlificDreamer. \n- Evaluation: The paper only considers 4 prompts in its evaluation. I think the quantity of experimental validation does not suffice to support the author\u2019s claim that ESD prevents Janus problem or mode collapse. I think the author should consider showing more experimental results to convince the readers.\nEffect of ESD vs seed: As discussed in DreamFusion, the most simplest way to evade Janus' problem is to use different random seeds. Thus, if ESD is better at preventing Janus\u2019 problem, the experiments should be designed to show how ESD successfully generates 3D content without Janus problem compared to ProlificDreamer or DreamFusion when repeated with different random seeds. \n- Ablation study: The author provides brief qualitative examples on how the entropy regularization hyperparameter $\\lambda$ affects the 3D generation. However, I think it would be much better how $\\lambda$ affects the 3D generation throughout the generation (i.e., 3D optimization) process, or how it prevents the mode collapse issue. This is related to 1. that the quantification of mode collapse will strengthen the author\u2019s point."
