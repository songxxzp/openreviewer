The hyperedges in the datasets are *not natural* but derived from social networks' simple edges, a specified base pair distance in gene data, and e-commerce product image embeddings, which can be modelled as node features. \n2. The hyperedges introduced can be obtained solely from *appropriately chosen graph data and node features*, limiting the originality of the curated hyperedges.\n3. The HypergraphSAINT sampler is a straightforward application of GraphSAINT [Zeng et al., 2020] to hyperedges.\n\n$~$\n### Significance\n4. Appropriately chosen GNNs (e.g., subgraph GNNs, MixHop, JKNets) on meticulously chosen graph datasets would be able to model the information given by the curated hyperedges, limiting the benchmark's potential impact.\n5. The significance of the work can be improved by the inclusion of recent hypergraph neural networks [e.g., Chien et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2023] that generate hyperedge embeddings to fully exploit hyperedges.\n\n$~$\n### Quality\n6. Contrary to the stated claim of extending hypergraphs with simple edges, e.g., see contribution 1 on page 2, the actual contribution involves integrating *curated hyperedges* with *naturally occurring edges* such as mutual followers in social networks and regulatory effects between genes in biological networks.\n7. Four different GNNs on pairwise edges are tested in the experiments, whereas the selection of GNNs on hyperedges is restricted to those introduced in a single paper [Bai et al., 2021], further emphasising simple edges over hyperedges.\n\n\\\nReferences:\n* [Wang et al., 2023]: Equivariant Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Operators, ICLR'23\n* [Chien et al., 2022]: You are AllSet: A Multiset Function Framework for Hypergraph Neural Networks, ICLR'22\n* [Bai et al., 2021]: Hypergraph convolution and hypergraph attention, Pattern Recognition'21\n* [Zeng et al., 2020]: GraphSAINT: Graph Sampling Based Inductive Learning Method, ICLR'20"

From a pure dataset perspective, what unique information do the hyperedges contribute that is not already represented by carefully/appropriately/meticulously chosen graph data and node features?\n2.

Have there been examples or scenarios where such derived hyperedges have demonstrated real-world applicability or have been utilised successfully in practical applications?\n4. Considering the potential benefits of incorporating recent hypergraph neural networks [e.g., Chien et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2023], are there any challenges or limitations associated with their implementation, and if so, how could these challenges be addressed to ensure seamless integration into the proposed SHGB framework?\n5. In what ways do the hyperedges complement or enhance the information captured by naturally occurring edges, such as mutual followers in social networks and regulatory effects between genes in biological networks? \n6. In addition to Table 3, are there specific examples or case studies where this integration has led to unique insights or improved predictions compared to utilising simple edges alone?\n7. Why was the selection of GNNs for hyperedges limited to those introduced in a single paper [Bai et al., 2021]? \n8. Were there specific criteria or reasons for this restriction, and how does this choice impact the overall diversity and representation of GNN models applied to hyperedges?"

The claim that \"using hyperedges may overlook simple pairwise node relations and thus make hypergraphs substantially lose useful graph information\" is overclaimed. Properly modeling hyperedges as sets and using complex set functions essentially cover simple pairwise relations as a special case [3]. The set representation is much more powerful in principle. The not-idea performance of hypergraph NNs as opposed to GNNs is just due to the non-idea way to construct hypergraphs and the suboptimality of hypergraph NNs. \n\n- Some recent more principled hypergraph NNs are missing to discuss, e.g. [4][5].
