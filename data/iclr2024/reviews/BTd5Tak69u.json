            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Overall this paper's most obvious weakness is its presentation. It is very difficult to understand what exactly the authors did. \n\nThe method seems extremely complex, or it is poorly described. Multiple paragraphs in the method read more like code than English. It would be great to provide a mid-level description that expresses why certain design choices were made, and what each component is trying to achieve. \n\nThe second paragraph of the intro is very hard to read. Besides appearing like a list of acronyms with citations, the sentences which begin with \"The methods,\" have incorrect usage of commas.\n\nThe paper says multiple times that the method will \"disentangle the scene representation into viewpoint and object representation\". Shouldn't there be multiple objects, and also perhaps a background? A camera pose and an \"object representation\" does not really achieve the compositional structure hinted at in other parts of the work. Judging by the other parts of the paper, my current guess is that sentences like these are simply inaccurate; perhaps they came from some earlier draft where the method was different?\n\nThe paper says that unlike other work, Slot Attention Encoder is input multiple viewpoints simultaneously. I think actually OSRT did this too (Sajjadi et al., 2022).  \n\nThe last paragraph of 3.1 is difficult to read. It would be better if none of the sentences started with math symbols. Multiple sentences have problems with plurals (e.g., \"The attention map are\").\n\nThe paper says \"One of the object-centric learning methods\u2019 essential and fundamental abilities is reconstructing the image of individual objects in the scene\". I am not convinced by this. Detectors are object-centric learning methods, and they do not typically have a reconstruction objective. \n\nThe paper says that \"To decompose complex natural scenes, DINOSAUR reconstructs the patch features extracted by a pre-trained self-supervised transformer (Caron et al., 2021), while STEVE reconstructs the whole scenes through the DVAE decoder. Therefore, we propose... \" It would be good to have a citation for STEVE here. Also the sentence makes it sound like DINOSAUR depends on STEVE. Finally, I do not follow the reasoning implied by the \"Therefore\". \n\nThe paper says \"Multiple fully connected layers are used to consist of gpatchdec to reduce the complexity of the model construct as much as possible.\" What is meant by \"the model construct\"? How does using multiple fully connected layers reduce complexity of something?\n\nI could not figure out what the connection is between the image encoder-decoder and the rest of the pipeline. I see that there is a cross entropy loss between \"o\" and \"z\", but I do not know why this is here. The paper mentions \"a categorical distribution with N classes\" a few times but I could not find more information about this. What is N? What are the classes? Why do we want to classify image patches according to these classes? What does this achieve?\n\nIn general I am not sure about the results. The paper describes the results as \"satisfactory\" and \"gratifying\", but this is entirely subjective. The quantitative results do not seem to show a clear win for the LORM method. Others, like DINOSAUR and STEVE seem to do better on the considered datasets. I see that DINOSAUR uses a pre-trained component, so I wonder if maybe another version of LORM might be good to try: one with a similar pre-trained part (i.e., semi-supervised setting). \n\nObjec-Centric -> Object-Centric"
