In order to make the search complexity manageable, the proposed method, LayerNAS, relies on a grouping/bucketing function which splits the search space into groups/buckets, with each group/bucket only keeping a small amounts of model architectures."

To the best of my knowledge, no one has done similar things before. In the task of size search on ImageNet, and both size search and topology search on NATS-Bench, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of LayerNAS.\n\nIn general, the idea is clearly described and easy to follow."

The paper didn't investigate the soundness of this assumption. For example, in algorithm 1, for a certain layer l and a certain value of h, only a few models with better performance are kept. Is it possible that in the final optimal model, the selected options for some layer i are different from ones that are kept during the search? This situation may become more likely given that each candidate is only trained for a small amount of epochs (e.g., 5 epochs used in the paper), as some architectures are easier to converge (e.g., showing lower loss at the early stage) but cannot keep the momentum till the end (e.g., the loss stop decreasing and the model is eventually surpassed by models with higher loss at the early stage).\n\n- In Table 2, the comparisons stops at FLOPs 627M. How does LayerNAS compare with EfficientNet-B1 and B2? It seems that the comparison with OFA is missing. OFA achieves 76.9% at 230M FLOPs and 80.0% at ~600M FLOPs.\n\n- It is unclear to me how LayerNAS can save some search cost by designing the mapping function $\\varphi$, in the case of topology search. The search space in the experiment \"NATS-Bench topology search\" is too small."

As mentioned in the end of Sec. 5.1, the architecture mechanisms of the searched networks in this work and other networks are not the same: for example, the authors used SE and Swish while others did not. These details including the undisclosed training strategy (like the learning, weight decay, data augmentation) might largely affect the accuracy, as demonstrated in [1], ConvNeXt [2], and many other followups. This is the key issues to evaluate this paper. Without the claim of using the exact same architecture and training strategy for fair comparison across methods, it is hard to evaluate this paper.\n\n2. Strong assumption based. This paper has to search per-layer. For layer i, it has to assume all the succeeding layers use the default operation (e.g. the most expensive operation) as stated in the first paragraph of Sec. 4. There is no theoretical analysis why this simple and strong assumption leads to better searched architecture than other NAS algorithms. \n\n3. Lack of literature.  Named as LayerNAS, this work lacks comparisons to pioneering work in layerwise NAS: SGAS [3], TNAS [4], and many other followups.
