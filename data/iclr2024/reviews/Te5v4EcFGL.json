The idea of channel independence and separately modeling inter-patches and intra-patches correlations have already been proposed in PatchTST [1]. In my view, PatchMixer simply replaces self-attention with convolutions. The essence of dual forecasting heads is skip connection, which has also been seen in previous works about time series forecasting such as TiDE [2].\n\n2. The improvement in prediction accuracy is negligible. From the results in Table 1, it can be seen that PatchMixer has very little or no improvement compared to PatchTST on datasets other than ETTh1 and ETTh2. In the ablation experiments in Table 2, the performance of Standard Convolution, Separable Convolution, and Attention Mechanism are comparable, which does not prove the superiority of Separable Convolution.\n\n3. The paper mentions two types of patch representation from PatchTST and TimesNet [3] respectively, but the experiments do not compare these two.\n\n4. The overall content of the paper is not substantial and there are some redundant paragraphs. For example, in the Method section, there are many introductions to Patch Representation and Embedding, but these parts can even be described in just a single paragraph.\n\n[1] A time series is worth 64 words: Long-term forecasting with transformers.\n\n[2] Long-term Forecasting with TiDE: Time-series Dense Encoder.\n\n[3] TimesNet: Temporal 2d-variation modeling for general time series analysis."

I had to spend some time to understand what the table means. For instance, I initially didn't get the first column which is PatchMixer \"minus\" another module. Because PatchMixer and another module are in separate rows, it looks like the first row is PatchMixer, and the second column is a comparing model. \n  - Figure 3 compares training and inference times but it's unclear where the speed-up comes from.

How are the training setups? Are the number of parameters similar? How many runs did you do for these experiments? Are the results consistent with different runs? I would like to know whether this error gap is actually significant.\n\n- The contributions of the paper are unclear. There are three points at the bottom of the Introduction but the experimental results do not support these arguments. For instance, could you explain why the PatchMixer layer is particularly helpful for long-term time series forecasting? Regarding efficiency compared to PatchTCT (Transformer-based), where does the speed-up come from? Does it have less computational cost but a similar model size compared to PatchTCT, or is it highly parallelizable? I assume both models have great parallelization capabilities. I try to understand where the efficiency comes from. There are lack of information to verify the contributions. Could you explain these in detail?"

Please correct me if I am wrong but, the patches used in this approach are 1D, right? I understand that other methods (Eqs. 1-3) are 2D, but I think that this is somewhat confusing. Perhaps it would be better to describe these methods in less detail here (and move details to the related work section) ?\n\n* Following the style guidelines of ICLR, I would recommend the authors to align tables with the top of the pages and put their caption on the top.\n\n* The results shown in Table 2 are very confusing. How are these divided? Basically all numbers here are either bold or underlined.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nWhile the paper presents several ablation studies, it takes over several assumptions from previous papers. Although the current paper already presents several ablations, I believe that the impact of the paper could be further enhanced by doing ablations on these different assumptions to analyze if these also hold in the current setting. For example:\n\n* The assumption that channel independence is better than channel mixing for forecasting tasks.\n\n* The size of the patches and their overlap.\n\n* The size of the conv kernels."
