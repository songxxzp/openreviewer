                "value": "The paper aims to improve crowd simulation methods, which are essential in various domains like traffic management, urban planning, and emergency management. Existing methods, rule-based and learning-based, have their limitations such as lack of authenticity and generalization, respectively. The authors introduce PINE, a framework that infuses physical biases and attention mechanisms into crowd simulation. PINE aims to enhance the authenticity and generalizability of crowd simulations by allowing pedestrians to adaptively adjust their behavior based on different influencing factors. PINE combines rule-based models with neural networks. It introduces modules like Feature Adaptive Extraction Module (FAEM) and Force Attention Module (FAM) to selectively extract and focus on relevant information and influences, improving the simulation's accuracy and physical consistency. A new Variable-step Rollout training algorithm is introduced to address cumulative errors during simulation, aiming to improve the model's performance further. Extensive experiments have been conducted, demonstrating that PINE outperforms state-of-the-art simulation methods in terms of accuracy, physical fidelity, and generalizability. Case studies are also visualized to help readers understand the advantages of this proposed method."

                "value": "1. PINE introduces a novel framework that combines rule-based models with neural networks, infusing physical biases and attention mechanisms into crowd simulation. The way the physical model and the neural network are combined makes sense. The framework enhances the authenticity and generalizability of crowd simulations, allowing pedestrians to adaptively adjust their behavior based on different influencing factors. Feature Adaptive Extraction Module (FAEM) and Force Attention Module (FAM) have been introduced to selectively extract and focus on relevant information and influences to long trajectories. All the model design reflects the authors' original thinking and insights regarding the crowd simulation problem, which is a very important issue and approach. A new training algorithm is introduced to address cumulative errors during simulation, aiming to improve the model's performance further.\n\n2. PINE has been extensively validated through experiments, demonstrating superior performance in terms of accuracy, physical fidelity, and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art simulation methods. I also enjoy the case study and visualization the authors give. The experiments are strong and promising. The generalization study and ablation study are comprehensive.\n\n3. I can appreciate the way of incorporation of the physical model. To get the optimized force at the output end, the attention mechanism is used to obtain the coefficients for incorporating the forces to simulate the intent of the crowd. The residual action is then used as a \u201clatent force\u201d to help facilitate the limited capacity or missed information from the physical model. To me, it seems that the FAM part is quite interpretable. We will be able to understand each agent's action robustly. Moreover, I like that the problem is defined as a simulation, since the black-box model alone only tells us what to do. With simulation of pedestrians, for example, we can even cut out this particular part as a simulation environment (as long as it is stable and accurate) for the reinforcement learning of the vehicle agent to learn from."

These situations are really the main barriers and challenges in the field. It would be better to discuss more about such anomalies and whether the proposed model is robust enough. \n\n2. Given the complexity and the number of components involved in the PINE framework, it might require significant computational resources for training and simulation. It would be better to have more information regarding the time complexity and time cost compared to previous methods and SFM methods."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The paper mentions that uniform physical rules fail to effectively capture individual differences such as age, gender, and culture in pedestrian behavior. Since w/o residual action results in drastic performance degradation, relying too much on the physical model is indeed harmful. However, is residual action modeled by a single MLP enough? Do you need more advanced structure to help with that? Or, if MLP is way good enough, should we try a simpler RA model for better interpretability?\n\n2. The so-called physical model of social force model is more like a self-defined \u201cphysical model\u201d instead of the physical model for natural phenomenon such as the falling of apple or the precession of mercury. The authors are correct in a way that such a physical model has its limitations, so I agree that incorporating deep learning is necessary while the \u201cphysical model\u201d provides stability and interpretability. I just wonder whether it would be better to have a more advanced \u201cphysical model\u201d such as PDEs and symbolic regression to do the job, rather than the basic Newton's second law of motion (it might be too simple).

It is important to clarify when providing summary on existing methods.\n\n2. In the paper, it is not clear on the implementation details of the sequential model, however, it is the crucial component to understand the rationality of later residual action generating. For example, In the equation (6), how does a simple MLP capture the intrinsic and stochastic factors in the behaviors? (i.e., whether the incorporated is the relative information, ect).\n\n3. In Section 4.5, When discussing the limitation of existing work, It is not clear why \"initiating iteration at a fixed length\" is computationally expensive. It is suggested to provide profound analysis and discussion.\n4. In equation (7), In the additional bias term, assume the i=100, the coefficient of the last item might be much greater than the actual gap between the actions, could the author explain more on the design here?\n5. Based on the equation (5), How is the attention weight learned and updated? From what is written here, it seems to be a simple sigmoid function? Does the author imply any kind of standard attention machism? If not, the term is misleading.\n6. In the experiment set ups, the baseline methods did not include some important methods like: Social-GAN, Social-LSTM, Social-STGCNN, etc. And the collision is not analyzed. Besides, one of the baseline methods: PCS does not seem to align with the original paper's performance on the same datasets GC and UCY. Could the author explain if is this caused by different settings or other factors?"
