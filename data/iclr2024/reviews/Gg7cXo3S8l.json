The authors demonstrate theoretically that minimizing the proposed loss is equivalent to maximizing the mutual information of representations and labels. Furthermore, they demonstrate empirically that their algorithm reduces the mutual information of representations and the nuisance."

Furthermore, in page 3, $y \\in \\mathbb{N}$ would imply an infinite amount of classes. Authors should refer to $y \\in \\{1,\\cdots, Z\\}$, as the authors do in table 4.

Another alternative to this would be to learn an MLP from the features to the embeddings, rather than using average pooling. I wonder if the authors tried this direction. \n2. Another question is wether the authors considered having more than one embedding per class, given that there may be variability within each class. - this could then be some hyperparameter: number of embs per class\n \n\n**Possible missing literature**:\n1. I think the paper relates very much to the literature of neural collapse in intermediate layers. It would be great to see the authors mention these works and make the connection. [1-4, 6]\n\n2.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I am not an expert of local learning or forward learning, though I am very familiar with representation learning and contrastive learning. So I read the most relevant cited papers in this work, and from my understanding, this work is a follow-up work of Wang et al. [1]. And my understanding is that the main difference between this work and [1] is the introduction of $\\lbrace t_1, \\cdots, t_Z \\rbrace$, the dictionary. So while conventional contrastive learning maximizes the similarity between a positive pair of samples' features, this work maximizes the similarity between a sample's feature and its corresponding $t_i$, and $t_i$ is also being updated during training. My following review is mostly based on the above understanding, and the comparison between this work and [1]. Please let me know if there is anything that I misunderstand.\n\nThe following are my major questions and concerns:\n### 1. Regarding Sections 3 and 4\nSections 3 and 4, arguably the most important two sections of this work, are really confusing. \n- Figure 1 compares \"$L_{feat}$\" with \"$L_{contrast}$\", and at first glance seems to suggest that contrastive learning is better than some other method called \"feat\", but this is not the case. Both methods minimize the contrastive loss, and the difference is that \"feat\" uses the intermediate outputs $h$ directly while \"contrast\" fits a network $\\phi$ on top of it. So this figure does not show that contrastive learning is better, or \"the performance of FF-based approaches falls short in comparison to InfoPro\". Instead, it only shows that using a neural network $\\phi$ is important. Thus, I am not quite sure what message the authors want to convey with Figure 1, as well as Figure 3.\n- An important motivation of this work and LL/FL as a whole is the goal of removing backprop (BP), because BP is not biologically plausible and is not memory efficient. The abstract and intro of this submission make this point very clear. My question is: If you use a neural network $\\phi$ in Eqn. (1), then how can you remove BP? Don't you use BP to train this $\\phi$? It might be true that using a smaller network $\\phi$ can save memory, but my point is BP is still there if you are using this $\\phi$, unless you are updating this $\\phi$ with local learning too (which I don't think is the case). Thus, I don't think the proposed method can be called forward learning (FL), which by definition should have no BP at all. And it is not very fair to compare the proposed method with FL methods.\n- In Section 4, \"Mapping labels to embedding vectors\", the authors wrote \"the label embeddings in the dictionary are updated at each step, making them a dynamic concept\". But how are these $t_i$ updated? Are they updated by minimizing the loss $L_{dict}$? If this is the case, then this update is not local, because remember that the same $t_i$ are shared across all layers (which then go through pooling), so the update signals of $t_i$ come from all layers. Consequently, the layers cannot be learned in parallel as FL methods, because all layers need to jointly update $t_i$. I would say that it makes more sense to me if these $t_i$ are fixed, unless there are some imperative reasons that $t_i$ must be updated.\n- In Eqn. (2), why there is an average over $K$? And why does there need to be $K$ feature maps for one class in the first place? Eqn. (2) can be simplified as $L_{dict} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum [ \\text{log} \\frac{\\text{exp}( \\langle h_n, t_+' \\rangle )  }{ \\sum \\text{exp}( \\langle h_n, t_i' \\rangle ) } ]$, where $h_n$ is the average of $h_n^k$. So why not just use one $h_n$, but use K $h_n^k$ if they are equivalent?\n\n### 2. Regarding the experiments\n- My biggest concern with the experiments is that this work is built upon InfoPro [1], yet in the experiments it is not compared to InfoPro [1] at all. I feel that it is very likely that the method proposed in this work has a very similar performance to InfoPro.\n- The experiments compare the proposed method with FL methods, which as I said is not very fair, because I don't think the proposed method is FL since it still uses backprop when updating $\\phi$. InfoPro [1] did not claim their method to be FL. In fact, their paper did not mention FL at all.\n\n[1] Wang et al., Revisiting locally supervised learning: an alternative to end-to-end training, ICLR 2021."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "Minor points:\n- The authors wrote $K = H \\times W$ in several places, which makes little sense to me. Why does an image need to have as many feature maps as the number of its pixels? And why does it need to have multiple feature maps in the first place?\n- Can you explicitly write out the formula of $pool_l$? For example, what does it do when $C_h^l > C_D$? Does it do zero padding? And can you tell me what is the motivation of pooling, other than adjusting the dimensions?\n\n\n**Summary:** Overall, though I do think that the idea of introducing a dictionary could be interesting, I don't think this work presents this idea very well and makes enough justification. The paper is really confusing at times. Moreover, I feel that even the authors themselves are confused sometimes, when they call their method FL which to my understanding really isn't, and use $K=HW$ features in Eqn. (2) which is equivalent to using a single feature. Thus, I recommend rejecting this submission.\n\n**Rebuttal note:** Score changed from 3 to 6.\n\nMy suggestion to the authors would be to read Wang et al. [1] very carefully, which I did before reviewing this submission. Their motivation was to improve over end-to-end training, and they did not mention removing BP or forward learning at all. That's why it makes sense for their method to use a BP-updated neural network, as long as it is modularized. Also, given the great similarity between this work  and [1], InfoPro should be the most important baseline in your experiments."
