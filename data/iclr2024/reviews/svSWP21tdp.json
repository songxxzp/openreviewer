Furthermore, the study reveals that model-induced distribution shifts can rapidly result in suboptimal performance, skewed class distribution, and underrepresentation of marginalized demographic groups. To address this challenge, this paper showcases the potential of algorithmic reparation to reduce disparities among sensitive groups."
