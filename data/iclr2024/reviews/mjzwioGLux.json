                "value": "* The authors provide a sound approach to matching, overcoming issues with confidence masks having different interpretations depending on the task by completely decoupling the certainty estimation as a posthoc step. The decoupling is also done in previous work (see PDCNet for example), but they do not detach gradients. What would have perhaps been even more interesting to see would be decoupling of the flow depending on the task. For example, small baseline tasks imply different priors on the types of flow that are likely. There is future potential in this type of approach.\n\n* The paper, except for some minor mistakes, is easy to follow and well written. \n\n* The task is important and a method unifying small and large baseline matching would be of great interest to the community.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* The model architecture is not well motivated. It seems similar to previous optical flow and dense feature matching works. It is not clear why the authors do not start from an established baseline like, e.g., PDCNet or GMFlow.\n\n* The performance on pose estimation is significantly below previous work. The MegaDepth benchmark, which is commonly used, is only shown briefly in the ablation, but no state of the art comparison is provided. The performance is about 5% lower than DKM. On ScanNet the performance is about 3% lower. Also on optical flow the relation to state of the art methods is not documented.\n\n* The ablation on the data is inconclusive. Adding optical flow datasets seem to lower results on pose estimation (Table 1). In the data ablation (Table 2) those results are no longer shown, why? Since those results are not shown, it must be assumed that adding more optical flow datasets further degrade performance.\n\n* Overall message. The manuscript fails in convincing that, with the currently available datasets, unifying wide and small baseline stereo is a good idea. The authors make a good attempt, and their model performs well at both tasks, but worse than the specialized counterparts. Showing that it is possible to do both tasks has been previously shown (GLUnet), so what remains to be shown is that the joint paradigm is superior."

Can this setting be used in other dense matching works to make it suitable for sparse matching tasks?\n\n2. The effectiveness of multi-scale design:\n\n   The method used the FPN and  generate simlarity matrix in three scales. However, in the following three GRU Refinement Blocks only one  matrix seemes to be used. How about the matrixes in other two scales. Besides, further ablations on the multi-scale design should be provided.\n\n3.

What are the advantages over previous datasets besides better optical flow supervision? More experimental results based on this dataset need to be given.\n\n4.
