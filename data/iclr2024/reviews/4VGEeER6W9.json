The deterministic variant is of particular interest because it has been difficult to analyze with existing techniques, despite being successful in practice. The main contribution of this work is to derive convergence guarantees for each of these processes under mild assumptions on the data distribution and the score function. Briefly, they provide an analysis of the deterministic algorithm which is the first to provide explicit rates of convergence, when the data distribution has bounded support (with only logarithmic dependence on the diameter) and when the score function and its Jacobian have been estimated. For the stochastic algorithm they recover similar results to the state-of-the-art, albeit with worse dimension dependence and stronger assumptions on the data distribution (compact support vs finite second moment)."

Less significant but nonetheless important is the authors' use of very specific step-size schemes, a remark on this would also be helpful.
