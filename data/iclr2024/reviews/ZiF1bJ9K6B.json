While the ultimate objective is total area covered, the authors proposes an additional total variation objective which minimizes the perimeter of explored areas to encourage coherent exploration, in addition to other collision objectives. The observation consists of multi-scaled and ego-centric maps of areas explored as well as frontiers, while the action space is the continuous speed and angular velocity of the agent. The authors trains the agent on a set of generated maps and evaluates on similar maps and additional maps from Explore-Bench. Favorable performance is demonstrated compared to frontier-based heuristics and some RL approaches."

                "value": "My main concern is that the baselines may not be challenging enough. Intuitively, I agree on the focus on frontier-based baselines, but there should be a traveling salesman (TSP)-based baseline which aims to find a shortest path among the frontier points with a state-of-the-art TSP solver like Concorde, either in a discretized grid (converted into a graph) or in a probabilistic roadmap (PRM) graph. As mentioned in the survey below, TSP is a common technique applicable in coverage path problems.\n```\nTan, Chee Sheng, Rosmiwati Mohd-Mokhtar, and Mohd Rizal Arshad. \"A comprehensive review of coverage path planning in robotics using classical and heuristic algorithms.\"\u00a0*IEEE Access*\u00a09 (2021): 119310-119342.\n```\nThe RL-based baseline (Hu 2020) targets a multi-agent setting and is a simple feed-forward policy with no convolutional architecture, and it\u2019s not clear if this is a fair comparison.\n\nOverall, there is very little detail on how the baselines are implemented in this work; many of the baselines are originally proposed in multi-agent settings rather than single-agent settings. It\u2019s difficult to judge how non-trivial the baselines are, and intuitively there should be a TSP-based or other combinatorial optimization-based baseline, given that CPP is a combinatorial problem. While the paper presents strong results relative to the given baselines, the baselines themselves have to be appropriately designed.\n\nMinor:\nI think the total variation contribution is slightly over-claimed, as the total variation is simply the perimeter of the explored area. While this shaping term is interesting and useful, using \u201ctotal variation\u201d to describe this reward makes the paper less clear and does not provide additional insights / intuition."

The paper currently lacks the corresponding gap from the classic methods and does not address the issue mentioned.\n\n- while the paper includes a number of different methods for comparison, there are some methods that are not discussed at all, but that however would be relevant to discuss, in particular some learning-based methods that are predicting the structure of the environments, such as \n\nCaley, Jeffrey A., Nicholas RJ Lawrance, and Geoffrey A. Hollinger. \"Deep learning of structured environments for robot search.\" Autonomous Robots 43 (2019): 1695-1714.\n\nShrestha, Rakesh, Fei-Peng Tian, Wei Feng, Ping Tan, and Richard Vaughan. \"Learned map prediction for enhanced mobile robot exploration.\" In 2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 1197-1204. IEEE, 2019.\n\nArguably, compared to classic methods, a learning based approach can potentially learn some patterns to choose locations that are promising in terms of new information.\n\n- there are parts that are not fully realistic, in particular the noise that would be present in the partial maps built by the robot, which has the effect of potentially guiding the robot towards areas that do not require exploration. It would be instead good to actually have the map built considering the noise. This can be achieved by using a realistic robot simulator with the perception/navigation stack already existing, e.g., in ROS.\n\n- it is also not clear why different methods are used for comparison in the omnidirectional and non-omnidirectional case, especially for the classic methods. Classic methods typically separate the high level decision and planning to the low-level control, so the same methods can be applied.\n\n- to appreciate the difference between methods, it is important to include also the standard deviation, i.e., in Table I. It would have been good to include coverage over time also for the omnidirectional case, in the appendix.\n\n- the multiscale component plays a role given the fixed w and h for the map, however, it is not clear the difference in performance between a multi-scale approach vs if those w and h would be high enough to capture the environment at enough fine resolution. It would be interesting to see such a difference. In addition, there might be environments where one scale is enough, while other complex environments require more than one scale. It would be interesting to discuss such a difference in different environments, thus hinting an adaptive scale, and how in practice an adaptive scale can be included, as the training will happen with specific scales.\n\n- a comment should be included about the impact of normalizing the distance measurements with respect to the maximum range, in particular about the generalization of the learned policy on a robot with different sensor range.\n\n- it is good to provide an intuition on how to set the parameters\n\nJust some minor presentation comments to fix:\n- \"in (1)\" -> \"in Eq.

Observation data is represented through multi-scale egocentric maps to enable long-term planning while maintaining scalable input representation. Additionally, the introduction of frontier maps helps retain information about uncovered spaces in larger-scale maps.

Figure 4 is a bit confusing too - I thought multi-scale frontier maps M_f are a par t of the observation too but the illustration in Fig 4 don\u2019t seem to mention that. Also, it wasn\u2019t super clear at first glance what x3 or x4 meant in the architecture.\n- I am not sure how practical the proposed approach is in real-world deployments - at the end of the day, the goal is to be able to deploy learned policies on real-systems. However, perfect observations for building global coverage/obstacle map and noise-free position/pose information are fairly strong assumptions that might limit practical utility. I do acknowledge the experiments with added Gaussian noise, but the scale of the noise isn\u2019t completely clear and it seems like noise was only added to position information. I would have loved to see some real-world experiments or experiments on high-fidelity simulators with some discussion on inference speed/real-time performance.\n- While I understand the work emphasizes on coverage path planning, I would have expected some discussion/experiments on the extent of collisions too - collisions matter in real-world problems, and unlike classical methods, the extent of collisions in a learned policy would at the end of the day depend on the relative weight of the collision-avoidance reward. It would be interesting to see the trade-off in the performance with more emphasis on collision avoidance when compared to classical approaches (to be clear, I am not recommending new experiments here - but it would be great if authors could discuss this aspect/share more details if they have the necessary information in the logs of existing runs)."
