Social reward is a form of community recognition that provides a strong source of motivation for users of online platforms to actively engage and contribute with content to accumulate peers' approval. Positive social feedback are essential for maintaining social cohesion and individual well-being. On online social platforms, users seek satisfaction via accumulation of their network\u2019s peers engagement with shared content in the form of likes, views, etc. Therefore, social reward can motivate users to engage with online platforms by providing them with a sense of validation and recognition from their peers.\n\nThe authors\u2019 analysis exposes the shortcomings of current metrics in modeling community creative preference of text-to-image models\u2019 outputs. Many quantitative experiments and user study show that Social Reward model aligns better with social popularity than existing metrics.\n\nThe dataset curation process for the million-user-scale dataset of implicit human preferences for user-generated visuals involved drawing from an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform. The dataset was curated by leveraging collective feedback, which implies multiple users\u2019 editing choices for the given content item, as a cleaning mechanism of organic implicit user behavior. A number of other data collection techniques had been utilized for addressing such biases as caption bias, content exposure time, and user follower base biases. Each positive and negative instance within the PA Image-Social dataset is a product of collective, independent, implicit voting by user community. I think this dataset would be valuable for many follow-up analyses."

It is used to demonstrate the distinctiveness of the Social Reward in comparison to those employed by existing solutions and to highlight the limitations of these solutions. \n\n(3)\tThe paper contributed to the field of T2I synthesis by introducing a new paradigm for evaluating the quality of AI-generated artworks that is more closely aligned with users' creative goals.
