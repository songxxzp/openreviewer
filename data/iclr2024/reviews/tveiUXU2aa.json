This broad-spectrum analysis significantly strengthens the validity and generalizability of the proposed approach.\n\n- Clarity and Accessibility of Presentation: The paper is exceptionally well-crafted, featuring lucid and coherent exposition. The methodology is articulated in a manner that is not only easy to comprehend but also straightforward to follow. This enhances the paper's accessibility to a broader audience within the field."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- Limited Applicability to ReLU-based Networks: One limitation of this approach is its dependency on neural networks using ReLU activations. While ReLU is widely used, it represents a subset of possible activation functions, which narrows the scope of application and might not encompass the full diversity of network architectures.\n\n- Similarity to NWOT Format: It's worth noting that the format of the proposed zero-cost proxy shares similarities with existing methods like NWOT. While not necessarily a weakness, this overlap should be acknowledged and explored further to understand the distinctions and innovations brought by SWAP-NAS.\n\n- Unclear Impact of Dimension: The influence of dimensionality remains somewhat obscure in the paper. It's important to consider that neural networks, especially in shallow layers, may exhibit varying feature map sizes. A more detailed analysis of how these differences affect SWAP-NAS would enhance the completeness of the study.\n\n- Absence of Correlation Visualization: The paper lacks visualizations that illustrate the correlation between SWAP and performance, which could provide valuable insights into the method's behavior and its implications for optimization. The inclusion of such visual aids would strengthen the paper's argument and help readers grasp the methodology's practical significance."

The paper claims versatility of SWAP-NAS across various tasks, including object detection, autoencoding, and the jigsaw puzzle. However, the primary focus seems to be on image classification results, such as ImageNet and CIFAR. Can the authors shed light on the reason for this specific focus? Furthermore, are there any plans or intentions to investigate SWAP's performance in the other mentioned domains in future work?"
