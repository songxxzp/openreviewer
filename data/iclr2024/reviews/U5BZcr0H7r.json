In my opinion, the abstention is like that we can pay an extra cost to avoid catastrophic outcomes. This seems more natural than the fixed regret setting or the fixed reward setting. \n\nMy next question is why we apply a Thompson Sampling based algorithm but not a UCB-based algorithm? Would a UCB-based algorithm work in this setting? What's its performance in experiments?"

The authors consider two models: one where abstaining incurs a fixed known reward to the agent and one where abstaining incurs a fixed known regret to the learner. Importantly, in every round the agent specifies both which arm to pull and whether to abstain or not. Even if the agent chooses to abstain, they sill observe a sample of the reward of the arm chosen from the true distribution of the rewards of the arm. \n\nIn the fixed regret setting, the authors provide an algorithm that achieves both a minimax optimal and an asymptotically optimal regret bound. Their algorithm builds upon a variant of Thompson sampling by Jin et al. '23, where a natural criterion is added that determines whether the learner should abstain or not. In order to show the optimality of their algorithm the authors extend well-known lower bounds from the stochastic multi-armed bandit literature to the setting they consider.\n\nSimilarly, in the fixed reward abstention setting the authors provide a transformation from algorithms that perform well in the traditional multi-armed bandit setting to algorithms that perform well in the setting that the paper considers. In particular, the authors show various instantiations of these transformations that obtain optimal minimax and asymptotic regret bound. In order to establish the optimality of their upper bounds, the authors prove matching lower bounds."
