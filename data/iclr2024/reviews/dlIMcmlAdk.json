Why not t=100, 300, or 400?\n  - Is it valid to assume \u03b4_{C=p_neg} \u2248 \u2212\u03b4_{D}?

In addition, can the authors provide the samples with different seeds and the same text prompts to show the diversity of generated contents?\n\nQ2. In Figure 3, what is the diffusion timestep? In addition, I think that the authors should show the results of \n$x_{\\text{OOD}} + \\delta_D + \\delta_N^{\\text{OOD}}$\n, where $\\delta_N^{\\text{OOD}}$ is the denoising score of $x_\\text{OOD}$, not $x_\\text{ID}$. I also suggest clarifying the notation of $\\delta_N$ and $\\delta_D$ in Figure 3, since the two scores are from different samples. \n\nQ3. Why do the prediction errors in Figure 4 (the second row) show a less-noisy map at t=1000? I think that the results are unintuitive, since they indicate that the score prediction at t=1 is difficult, while the score prediction at t=1000 is conducted almost perfectly except for the central region. \n\nQ4. In Section 4, the authors claim that the magnitude of the noise to be removed is monotonically decreased in the backward process. I wonder how we can assume that the scale of the domain score is preserved? Is there any rationale that only $\\delta_N$ decreases over the backward process, while $\\delta_D$ preserves its scale?\n\nQ5. How about the results of SDS, where its CFG adopts the same negative prompts as NFSD, described in Section 4?\n\nQ6. The authors have discussed that ProlificDreamer\u2019s LoRA adaptation has a similar role with NFSD to exclude the prediction error of the denoising term $\\delta_N$. Then, can the LoRA of ProlificDreamer be replaced with NFSD, while variational particle optimization is used? It would be interesting to show the compatibility of NFSD with ProlificDreamer.\n\nQ7. Since NFSD requires additional inference at each training iteration due to negative prompting, I think that comparing the results of NFSD with those of SDS in terms of the number of function evaluations (NFEs) of diffusion models. \n\nQ8. In Section 4, how can we assume that the score prediction on text conditions is also composed of $\\delta_D + \\delta_N + \\delta_C$, where $\\delta_D + \\delta_N$ is equal to the unconditional prediction? I think that it is a technical flaw, since Eq.(3) just implies $\\epsilon_\\phi (z_t ; t) - \\epsilon_\\phi (z_t  ; y=p_\\text{neg}, t) = \\delta_{C=p_\\text{neg}}$. That is, $\\delta_C$ is defined with both conditional and unconditional scores, not solely on the conditional score term. \n\nQ9. How is the negative prompt to estimate the domain term defined? I wonder whether the negative prompt is universal regardless of the image renderer. In addition, it assumes that the domain score can be estimated by the text prompts. However, how can we say that the image is from out-of-distribution, when the image can be estimated by text prompts of text-to-image models?\n\nQ10. Can be simply using $s \\delta_C$ for the score distillation possible without $\\delta_D$? That is, using $\\delta_D$ is necessary?"
