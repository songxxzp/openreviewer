I would like to see some analysis, or at least some intuition, on why the results would hold on the natural setting.\n\nThe assumption on the data (Assumption 1) is strong, as it is not met by almost all real data. \n\nThe significance of the results is limited, as it is an extension of similar results from $\\epsilon \\to 0$ to the finite but small $\\epsilon$."

In general, since the training is nonconvex even with correlated/separable data due to the nonlinear relu activation function in the los. SGD/GD converges to a local minimum and indeed, this has been observed and numerically validated in the literature; see also [R1] Brutzkus et al. 2018. SGD learns over-parameterized networks that provably generalize on linearly separable data. ICLR. [R2] Wang et al. 2019. Learning ReLU networks on linearly separable data: Algorithm, optimality, and generalization. IEEE TSP. In [R1], SDG for two-layer ReLU networks under separable data converges to local minimum; yet for leaky ReLU networks, it finds global minimum. In [R2], it also shows that plain SGD on ReLU networks using separable data converges to local minimum numerically. Yet, a bit modification on the SGD helps SGD converge to a global minimum but with random initialization. It would be great if a comparison can be made between the approach in [R2] and the small-initialization SGD for training two-layer ReLU networks on e.g., MINIST. Moreover, is there any transition for such initialization value to go from the two-phase to single-phase gradient flow convergence to local minimum?\n3) It would be great if more numerical tests are provided to demonstrate the two-phase convergence and provide the plots. \n4) If the second-layer weights are initialized not in a balanced manner (although not initialized according to (3)), I understand it would also work and guess that the imbalance between positive v_j and negative v_j values only influences the time it takes for the two-phases. More balanced initalization, faster convergence. It would be interesting to numerically validate if this is the case. \n5) There are some grammar issues and typos. Please correct."
