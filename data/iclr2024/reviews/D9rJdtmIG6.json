                "value": "The authors focus on the problem of latent spatial confounding, where a number of latent variables that vary smoothly across space causally affect both treatment and outcome.  Some algorithms have been proposed to account for this.  However, evaluation of these algorithms is hindered by a lack of empirical datasets with known ground truth.  To fill this void, the authors propose a method for generating semi-synthetic data with realistic dynamics and spatial confounding.  The spatial variables can then be removed from the training data to create a dataset with latent spatial confounding.  The authors create sets of empirical data in 6 domains, describe the process of generating the semi-synthetic data, and evaluate the performance of multiple spatially-aware causal discovery algorithms across various data settings.  The entire processing framework is encapsulated in a Python package."

As someone familiar with causal modeling but largely unaware of advances in spatial modeling, this paper does a great job of motivating the problem.  While the contribution (generating semi-synthetic data from realistic treatment, outcome and confounders) isn't novel in and of itself, the combination of the extension to a spatial setting, the curation of six data collections, and the creation of a Python package to support the full pipeline are important enough contributions on their own.  I think this paper has a logical flow and explains each piece well, making it a smooth read.  While I can not speak to the algorithms compared, the hyper-parameters varied (smoothness, level of confounding, and binary vs continuous treatment) provide a nice coverage.  I also appreciate the authors' treatment of future work and ethical considerations."

While Figure 2 does show correlation between two locations s and s', the graphic certainly doesn't show that the correlation increases as s and s' get closer...\n\nGiven how information-dense Figure 4 is, I wish more analysis were provided of the results.  As it stands, there is only a single paragraph in Section 5 that discusses findings in Table 4.  In addition, With table 4 being aggregated across all 6 datasets, we're unable to assess how the performance differs across them.  While Figure 10 in the Appendix does show the breakdown by dataset, there is no discussion of the results.  I understand that space is tight, but I think including a bit more analysis in the paper, or at the very least in the appendix, would help the experimental results feel more impactful.\n\nAt the end of the second paragraph of Section 2, it says \"When a confounder is not unobserved, identification is not guaranteed\" - did you mean to say 'When a confounder is not observed\" or \"unobserved\"?\n\nMinor error: in the second to last paragraph of the Introduction, there's the line \"SpaCE offers Each dataset has a set of known missing confounders [...]\""

Does the method fail in the cases of Y = f(X, a, R)?\u00a0\n\n2. Counterfactual inference/generation typically starts from the abduction step that infers the value or distribution of exogenous variables. However, in causal model (1), it is not clear which letter(s) denotes the exogenous variable(s).\u00a0\n\n3. What is the relationship between the residual R and the exogenous variable in the generation of Y? If R is the exogenous variable for Y, the authors need to consider a more general causal mechanism, rather than just the additive noise model (ANM). If R is not the exogenous variable, why the authors can use equation 1 for counterfactual inference?"

There are many ways in which the treatments, outcomes, and covariates of neighboring units can interact, including treatment of one unit causing outcome in neighboring units, treatments causing treatments, and outcomes causing outcomes (and even outcomes causing treatments). It would seem reasonable to construct semi-synthetic data generation methods that could, in principle, produce all of these effects.\n\nThe authors produce a variety of data sets that use real treatments and covariates (and synthetic outcomes). Given that real treatments are used, there clearly could be spatial correlations among those variables. Thus, generated data sets may already have some degree of treatment-to-treatment spillover or covariate to (multiple) treatment dependence that produces that spatial dependence among treatment values.\n\nThe authors do not cite a large and recent literature on evaluation methods for causal inference. While this literature is not about spatial confounding specifically, it provides a large number of analogs in the context of non-spatial confounding and it is worth citing.
