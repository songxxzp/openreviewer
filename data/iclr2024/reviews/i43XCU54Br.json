Previous work often include a static set of agents, which does not generalise to various tasks and requires strong human priors. In contrast, DyLAN (Dynamic LLM-Agent Network) has the following advantages with their design: 1. agents with different roles can exchange messages via the feedforward network 2. early-stopping when the agents reach consensus 3. automatic team optimisation by propagation (rating their predecessors in the network), aggregation (aggregate ratings from successors to quantify an agent's contribution) and selection (selecting top performing agents according to their scores derived from the propagation and aggregation steps). Finally, the model is evaluated on reasoning and coding tasks and demonstrates improved performance with reasonable computation cost."

I see that on some topic which is debatable, perspectives from agents with diverse roles would help, but it is unclear if that is necessary on some topics which has a single correct solution?\n- If an agent is assigned the role of a doctor for solving the example mathematics problem, is the underlying language model deliberately trying to act as if it doesn't know how to solve the problem despite the fact that the same language model underlies the role of the mathematician?\n- For example, if we started with a majority of non-experts and a minority of experts, could the system potentially produce a wrong solution due to the non-experts reaching a consensus on a wrong solution and being the majority of the multi-agent system?\n\nOn Page 1, in the last paragraph, what does sensitivity mean?"

DyLAN was compared against representative works that also attempt to improve the performance of a collection of interacting LLMs. Ablation studies were also conducted to demonstrate the importance of various factors related to DyLAN's training process and its own agent selection and early-stopping mechanism."

At least compared to the methods provided in the related section of the work, DyLAN appears to have significant differences (i.e. with respect to the early stopping and agent selection mechanisms) with previous work, which seem plausible in further improving the performance of an ensemble of LLMs. Nonetheless, the topic of training a collection of interacting LLMs itself seems to have been explored by previous works already.\n\n**Minor Strength - Quality - Method Soundness**\n\nExcept for some minor weaknesses (written in the section below), DyLAN's early stopping and agent selection mechanism seems generally sound from a multiagent systems perspective. Given the existence of a sufficient number of LLMs that can expertly handle an input query, I find it plausible that DyLAN should be able to identify a smaller number of LLMs whose response we can refer to once they achieve consensus.\n\n**Major Strength - Quality - Experiment**\n\nWhile I cannot comment much on the baseline selection following my limited knowledge of the topic, I find that the designed experiments were well designed to demonstrate DyLAN's advantages in terms of its overall accuracy and incurred cost during an interaction. At the same time, I highly appreciate the ablation study conducted by the authors to investigate the importance of the early-stopping and agent selection mechanisms. I especially like how it demonstrates the importance of the agent selection mechanism.\n\n**Major Strength - Clarity - Experiment Analysis**\n\nAs a reader with less expertise in this topic, I also highly appreciate how the authors carefully outlined the different insights gained from each experiment. This helps in pinpointing the importance of the DyLAN's various components and in gaining an understanding of the capabilities achieved by DyLAN. Similarly, insights gained from comparison against different baselines were properly written down, also making it easier for a reader with less expertise in this topic."

While it is unfortunate that it was relegated to the appendix, Figure 5 is an excellent figure that could have helped readers understand the problem being solved if it had been presented earlier. In place of Figure 5 which seems to take a lot of space, perhaps the authors could consider describing a formal model of the interaction between agents and decision-making problems just to give more context.\n\n**Minor Weakness - Soundness - Expert LLMs being outnumbered by non-expert members of the ensemble**\n\nI suppose one of the weaknesses of DyLAN is when the number of expert LLMs for dealing with a particular query is significantly lower than the number of non-experts. If somehow the number of non-expert LLMs selected during agent selection is still larger than the experts after agent selection, DyLAN can still yield poor accuracies. Perhaps it could be useful to have multiple rounds of agent selection until some average score/metric (ideally reflecting their capacity in solving the task) of the remaining LLMs is above a certain threshold.\n\n**Minor Weakness - Soundness - Absence of reliable rankers**\n\nAnother possible pitfall occurs when DyLAN does not have a reliable ranker for agent selection, which results in the selection of possibly highly suboptimal members of the ensemble for the final decision."

                "value": "This paper suggests the creation of a tactical group of agents that communicate within a flexible interaction structure tailored to the specific task at hand. The approach involves developing a system called the Dynamic LLM-Agent Network (DyLAN), which facilitates collaboration among LLM agents on complex activities, including reasoning and generating code. DyLAN allows for multi-round interactions among agents within an adaptable framework, incorporating on-the-fly agent selection and a premature termination feature to enhance both performance and efficiency. Additionally, this paper introduces a method for the automatic optimization of the agent team, utilizing an unsupervised metric named the Agent Importance Score. This score helps in determining the most effective agents by evaluating the individual contributions of each agent."

This paper proposes a framework DyLAN, which presents a novel structure for LLM-agent cooperation, assembling agents in a tiered, feed-forward network that features adaptive architecture, incorporating mechanisms for selecting agents during inference and halting the process prematurely when necessary. \n2. To optimize agent collaboration within DyLAN, this paper crafted a self-governing optimization algorithm that leverages an Agent Importance Score determined without supervision, aiming for a balance of performance and efficiency.\n3. This paper claimed that DyLAN has been shown to deliver strong results in accuracy, efficiency, and consistency across a spectrum of tasks, including general reasoning, numerical problem-solving, and the generation of code."

                "value": "Cons:\n1. This paper cannot demonstrate that agent collaboration must perform better than single agent. For example, in Figure 6, the agent collaboration is totally unnecessary. The roles such as Programmer, Economist and Doctor are useless for the math reasoning problem.\n2. The results are not convincing. For example, does agent collaboration really perform better than single agent on math reasoning? The example in Figure 6 does not show the benefit of agent collaboration on math reasoning.\n3. The collaboration process is unclear. For example, in Figure 5, how does the algorithm developer and programmer collaborate together? It seems programmer can already finish the task very well.\n4. It is suggested that the authors explain more clearly the function of Agent Importance Scores using examples. Otherwise, it is unclear why it is necessary. This paper says that \u201cWe ignore the peer rating scores in responses of agents for computing Agent Importance Scores.\u201d In Figure 5. The author may not ignore the peer rating process.\n5. The contribution is limited. The agent collaboration framework only use \u201crole-playing\u201d for different agents, which is proposed in the previous paper [1], and also discussed in many previous papers such as [2]. It is suggested that the authors could consider adding tool use. For example, it does not make sense to use LLMs as unit tester (in Figure 5).\n6. Some important references are missing. It is worth noting that this paper does not cite the paper [1] which proposed \u201crole-playing\u201d.\n\n[1] CAMEL: Communicative Agents for \"Mind\" Exploration of Large Language Model Society NeurIPS 2023 https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760\n\n[2] Unleashing cognitive synergy in large language models: A task-solving agent through multi-persona self-collaboration https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05300"

However, the paper is generally incremental work building on a lot of recent research around multi-agent LLMs. The techniques used, like inference-time pruning and unsupervised contribution scoring, are not completely new concepts either. \nIn more details:\n- The experimental validation is reasonable but mainly incremental - evaluating on established datasets with existing baseline methods. More complex, real-world tasks could be illustrative.\n- The paper claims efficient collaboration but the overhead of techniques like peer rating and consensus checks could be significant. More analysis on computational costs is needed.\n- There is limited ablation study or analysis into the agent scoring method. It is unclear if it is actually capturing meaningful contribution effectively.\n- Why was CodeT chosen as the baseline? This does not appear to be a reasonable baseline. CodeT is not a multi-agent framework for code generation. It works on the principle of generating more test cases in order to improve the ranking of the solutions. Stronger baselines should be chosen for a fairer comparison.\n- The presentation seems repetitive in parts with previous sections being paraphrased. More clarity and conciseness in writing would strengthen the paper."
