Aren't the molecules supposed to have a lot more \"clusters\", sub-components?\n\n- I'm curious how making this approach multi-modal can be helpful. Could graph embeddings or vision embeddings of the molecules provide any benefit? I'm not a molecular properties expert, but I tried a couple of the figures (table 2 and figure 2) with GPT-4 vision, and it gave meaningful explanations.

While the ideas of multi-level molecule representation and embedding interpolation are well-established in the field, the authors merely integrate them into the newly introduced textual inversion framework. This casts doubts over the paper's genuine novelty and the depth of its technical contribution.\n\n2. The rationale for adopting the textual inversion model appears somewhat nebulous. In my understanding, compared to SMILES, graph representations are generally more adept at modeling molecular structures. Notably, many graph-centric molecular generation methods have already incorporated hierarchical concepts. In their experiments, while the authors argue that HI-Mol surpasses several graph-based models, the underlying reasons remain unelucidated. An elucidation on how the textual inversion model specifically augments the molecular generation task, relative to its graph-based counterparts, would be greatly beneficial.\n\n3. There's an absence of crucial baselines. The authors have chosen to compare their work with two SMILES-based baselines, one based on RNN and the other on spanning tree. However, they have not included any methods based on large-scale text-to-molecule models, many of which are mentioned in the related works section. Therefore, it is unclear whether the improved performance of HI-Mol is attributable to the utilization of large-scale text-to-molecule models."
