                "value": "The paper presents a new compressed matrix format (parametrization) called GBLR and an optimization method (involving proximal gradient descent, homotopy, and STE) to learn the parameters of the format to make NNs faster and smaller. The proposed parametrization can be understood as a juxtaposition of low-rank matrices of various shapes that needs to be appropriately padded. Such a parametrization is very flexible as contains regular low-rank matrices (if the shape of the blocks are same as the shape of the entire matrix), block low rank matrices, and block sparse. To be more specific, every low-rank submatrix  is represented as a sum of rank-1 matrices; thus, for a given subblock of rank $k$ parameters include shape of submatrix ($w$,$h$), location within orgininal matrix (i,j), and actual values that are $k$ rank-1 matrices of $w \\times h$ stored as $w\\times 1$ and $1 \\times h$ updates.\n\nSuch a parametrization has many non-differentiable parameters, and to make it amenable to SGD based solvers the authors propose several modifications: instead of storing compact $w\\times 1$ and $1\\times h$ rank-1 matrices, the parametrization now involves the whole $n\\times 1$ and $1\\times n$ vectors that are appropirately masked with vector $m$. The mask presents a boxcar filter which is non-differentiable itself, but author approximate it via Gaudi mask in frequency domain with gaussian kernel (with variance $\\sigma^2$); Gaudi mask converges to boxcar with $\\sigma \\to \\infty$ which needs to be driven during training (hence a homotopy). Also, during the training the width $w$, height $h$, location $i,h$, are kept real-valued (for SGD) but apply straight-through estimation for actual matrix recreation. And finally, to drive matrix rank selection, authors propose a cost based selection via an $\\ell_1$ penalty (controlled by $\\lambda$) on certain structure parameters (since the exact equation is not given, I'm guessing on every rank-1 matrix?).\n\nAs for training of the compressed models, the authors plug in GBLR parametrized matrix instead of original weight matrices of nns (the initial values are obtained via an algorithm in A.2), choose appropriate $\\lambda$ (to control for rank), and train or finetune end-to-end on a dataset. The results clearly show that such a scheme gets a better compression-accuracy tradeoff."

                "value": "I find two minor weaknesses of the paper, literature review and comparison to other methods.\n\nAlthough I understand that the focus of paper was compression of transformer based models, it seems many relevant low-rank and tensor-decomposition based methods that were used for compression of other networks (CNNs) were left out. Many of those left out papers share similar ideas (e.g., how to parametrize wrt rank) that need to be included. Some of the missed out works include:\n- Factorized Higher-Order CNNs with an Application to Spatio-Temporal Emotion Estimation \n- Low-rank Compression of Neural Nets: Learning the Rank of Each Layer\n- Coordinating filters for faster deep neural networks\n- Constrained optimization based low-rank approximation of deep neural networks\n- Compressing Neural Networks: Towards Determining the Optimal Layer-wise Decomposition\n\nbut there are many others (you can find others by looking within those)\n\nComparison to the relevant baselines. It seems the baselines authors choose are very simple (e.g., using a fixed rank for low-rank compression), and can be considerably strengthened if wanted. Thus I'm asking authors to include stronger baselines (low rank with rank selection, tensor decomposition methods) to compare."

What is the value of $\\lambda$ used in experiments? How to choose it properly?\n3. What was the scheme used for $sigma$? The paper says that it was \"gradually increased to 100\", but having exact details is preferred.\n4. Certain computations (Gaudi function) happens in frequency domain that involves DFT and IDFT; how expensive is this operations wrt single training step? No slowdown, 0.75x slowdown, etc..\n5. Please included a more detailed literature review.\n6. Please strengthen the baselines.\n7. I am wondering why section 3.3 discusses the application on the basis of two layer MLP \"for ease of understanding\"? Wouldn't an example on a single layer be much simpler? BTW, there is a typo in this section, multi-layer perception => multi-layer perceptron"
