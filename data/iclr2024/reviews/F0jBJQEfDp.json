The closed-form solution of optimal policy in theorem 3 resembles FOCOPS. In fact, the provided theoretical results do not explain how the proposed method exceeds the baselines in terms of final performance or training stability.\n2. In the experiment, the proposed method obtains very similar performances to baselines. In fig.2, ACPO has no remarkable advantage over CPPOPID and FOCOPS in terms of both reward improvement and constraint satisfaction. In fig.3, ACPO cannot even converge to satisfy the cost constraint after 10M steps on Goal tasks -- the hardest tasks in this paper. Although ACPO combines the components from several previous methods, there is no significant empirical improvement over them.\n3. Although this paper roots on the instability issue of previous safe RL method, the proposed method does not show better stability. It can be found the variance scale of ACPO is similar to FOCOPS in table 3, and it also suffers from early-stage cost fluctuations in fig.3."

If they are different, why are the performances on \"generalization\" setting superior to them in original setting?

For example, in (10), there are so many parameters, at least I do not have confidence to successfully optimize a policy and each parameter.  I understand if each parameter is set to a proper value, then the policy is learned in a stable manner. Regarding this, I ask a question below.\n- Though it is quite recent, there is the following paper that is strongly related. I think it is better to cite it and discuss their differences at least \"in text\" (I do not require the authors to conduct experiments since this paper can be viewed as a concurrent work). Also, the title is almost same and the only difference is with or without \"Proximal\". I would recommend the authors to change the title in order to make the difference clearer.\n    - Dai et al., \"Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization for Safe Reinforcement Learning\". https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/25888\n- Regarding the experiments, I do not think that authors provide the details for reproducing their experiments. Unless I miss something, there is no source-code attached and no table for the parameters used in their experiments. I think it is almost impossible to reproduce the authors' results from the paper.\n\n**Minor Comments**\n\n- When I first read this paper, Figure 1 was unclear.

If there are other assumptions, I would recommend the authors to explicitly note it in the paper.\n\n[Q3] Regarding $g(\\xi^i)$, I think this function is not differentiable. Practically, is this approximated by some differentiable function such as $\\log(\\cdot)/\\alpha$ as conducted in IPO?\n\nNote that, though my current rating is \"6: marginally above the acceptance threshold\", I would happy to change the score based on the authors' rebuttal and revision since I consider that this paper is substantially nice."
