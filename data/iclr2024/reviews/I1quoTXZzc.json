To train the class energy network, the Boltzmann distribution is used to define the conditional likelihood of y given input x. The class energy network maps the input class pair (x, y) to real-valued scalar energy, negative log-likelihood is used as a loss function.\n- Concept Energy Network: It consists of K sub-networks (one for each concept), the input is an embedding that represents the aggregate of positive and negative concept embedding $v_k$ (similar to CEM) along with $z$ $E_\\theta^{concept}=G_{zv}(z,v_k)$. As done for the class network negative log-likelihood is used as a loss function.\n\n- Global Energy Network: this network learns the dependencies between the concepts and the output. As an input it takes the class embedding  $u$ all concepts embeddings  such that   $E_\\theta^{global}=G_{vu}([v_{k}]_{k=1}^{K},u)$. The negative log-likelihood loss is calculated for each concept-class pair. \n\n\n## Prediction:\nTo make a prediction feature, the feature network and energy networks are frozen then search for optimal prediction of concepts $\\hat{c}$ and the class label $\\hat{y}$ by minimizing equation 12.\n\n## Interventions:\nOne of the main advantages of ECBMs over other methods is that they are able to propagate the corrected concept to other correlated\nconcepts, this is done automatically while optimizing for $\\hat{c}$ and $\\hat{y}$ and changing some values in $\\hat{c}$ to ground-truth $c$.\n\n## Conditional interpretations:\nBy using the energy functions given a target class one can calculate the marginal concept importance for that class, the joint concepts importance for that class, the conditional probability between concepts for that class and the conditional probability between concepts (without taking class into consideration i.e the conditional probability summed over classes).\n\n## Experiments:\n- The paper compared ECBMs with CBMs, CEMs, PCBMs and ProbCBM; across 3 datasets.\n- For evaluation, the paper compared (a) Concept accuracy (i.e. predict each concept independently). (B) The overall concept accuracy, this evaluates that all concepts are predicted correctly for a given sample i.e concept vector == ground-truth vector. (C) The class accuracy.\n- For the experiments they looked at concept and class label prediction (without any interventions), concept and class label prediction with interventions and conditional interpretation."

I disagree, in the original CBM on top of the CBM layer there is a linear which quantifies how each concept affects the final output so if a model classifies an image with label \"A\" we can look at the weight matrix and see which concepts where used in this classification yes at inference time (assuming we don't have the ground truth concepts) we don't know if the model correctly classified the concepts or not or the likelihood of a concept being correctly classified but we do know the relationship between the concepts and the final output.\n- The paper is not very clear, please see the questions section.\n\n## Significance --Fair:\n- ECBMs Training: Training is much more complicated than regular CBMs and probably much more expensive particularly optimizing equation 10.\n- ECBMs Inference requires optimization not just a forward pass through the network.\n- Usage and reproducibility: There was no code to reproduce the experiment. It is very difficult to imagine how all of this is trained together without the code."

The proposed model addresses (1) the lack of concept-based models that can capture relationships between concepts and labels and (2) the inability of test-time concept interventions in existing concept-based models to propagate to concepts besides those being intervened on. ECBMs achieve these goals via the use of energy functions that capture the joint probabilities between input features, concepts, and task labels. By learning these functions in an end-to-end fashion with an aggregate loss function, and composing these energy functions at inference time, one can (1) produce task predictions with corresponding concept explanations, (2) estimate concept importance for specific labels, and (3) impute mispredicted unintervened concepts after an intervention has been performed, therefore improving the impact of interventions on a model's performance. This paper evaluates ECBMs on three real-world datasets and shows that they can outperform existing baselines on both task and concept accuracy."

In particular, I believe that the following are the main strengths of this paper:\n\n1. **Originality**: the idea of incorporating energy functions to model inputs, concepts, and task labels concurrently is, to the best of my knowledge, something that has not been attempted in previous work in the concept-based literature. In particular, I found the use of these energy functions to propagate interventions to be both original and interesting.\n2. **Quality**: although the quality of the experiments could be significantly improved on (see below), the quality of the presented idea, as the presentation of the idea itself, meets the standard of what I would expect in this field and is very clearly elaborated.\n3. **Clarity**: the paper\u2019s writing is extremely clear and easy to follow. This helps the authors clearly communicate their ideas and the motivation behind the ideas. Although this work could benefit from further details when it comes to elements crucial to reproducibility (see below), I deeply thank the authors for writing in a very concise and clear manner throughout the manuscript. This lack of details, however, is the reason behind my \"fair\" score in the presentation field above.\n4. **Significance**: the paper\u2019s main contribution, that of reframing concept learning as learning sets of joint probability distributions, can lead to novel and significant ideas in the future. It is certainly a novel and significant way to think about concept learning. Nevertheless, this significance is contingent on the paper\u2019s core idea being carefully proven to work as expected (see weaknesses below).  If the experiments are carefully corrected for the weaknesses stated below, and the paper\u2019s main claims still hold, then I believe this paper would be of good value to the community."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Although I found several parts of this work to be strong and well-defined, I have the following hesitations regarding this paper in its current state:\n\n1. [Critical] In my opinion, the biggest weakness of this paper is its evaluation and the fairness of the evaluation itself. As discussed in the questions below, this paper seems to compare baselines with significantly varying capacities and fine-tuning processes ( e.g., ProbCBM is trained with a ResNet18 backbone in the source of the results reported in this paper vs ECBM trained with a ResNet101 backbone) as well as failing to evaluate key contributions across several tasks (e.g., interventions are evaluated on a single task). This yields a lot of the evaluation inconclusive as it makes the source of the improvements shown in the proposed model hard to identify.\n2. [Critical] Against common practices in the field, none of the results in the evaluation section include error bars. Without such error bars, it is very hard to judge for statistical significance. This is particularly important for the paper\u2019s main evaluation in Table 1 where differences between ECBMs and other baselines are small for task (e.g., \u201dclass\u201d) accuracies on some tasks.\n3. [Critical] Some of the key baseline results in this paper seem to contradict the results presented in previous literature. For example, CEM\u2019s intervention performance in Figure 2 is in direct contradiction to those reported in the original paper and in subsequent works ([1, 2, 3]). Furthermore, the authors claim that ProbCBMs cannot be trained on CelebA due to the binary nature of the concept annotations. This however, to the best of my understanding, is not a requirement for ProbCBM (an example is CUB itself which is used as a baseline for this method even though it has not uncertainty labels as claimed by the manuscript). Similarly, results for Post-hoc CBMs are missing for CelebA and AWA2 as the authors claim that Post-hoc CBMs require \"predefined concept activation vectors.\" This is not true as the CAVs needed for PCBMs can be easily learnt from a dataset with binary concept annotations as those in CelebA and AWA2. In fact, the authors of that paper do this exact process for CUB.\n4. [Critical] A lot of details required for reproducibility are missing. There is no code attached to this submission as part of the supplement. There are no details on the details and training procedures of any of the baselines. The hyperparameter selection is not discussed anywhere, which brings doubt to the very specific precision indicated for some of ECBM\u2019s selected hyperparameters (e.g., $\\lambda_c = 0.49$).\n5. [Major] Related to the point above, there are no ablation studies showing the sensitivity of the proposed method to its hyperparameters ($\\lambda_{\\{c, g\\}}$).\n6. [Major] The claim that previous concept-based methods do not allow one to understand concept to label relationships is not entirely true. Post-hoc CBMs enable this via their sparse interpretable predictor and even vanilla CBMs tend to be trained with a linear layer on top of their concept bottleneck, rendering an easy mechanism to obtain concept importance for a given label via the linear layer's weights.\n7. [Major] The proposed evaluation is limited in the number and quality of the competing baselines. For example, several of the baselines are missing values in Table 1.\n8. [Minor] Inference on ECBMs requires one to solve an optimization problem via a relaxation that is solved with gradient descent + back-propagation. This means that this proposed approach may not scale well to a setup where one is expected to run inference quickly or as part of a separate pipeline, which needs to be end-to-end differentiable.\n9. [Minor] The paper lacks any discussion of the limitations of its method. The last section, which has \u201climitations\u201d on its title, fails to discuss any of the limitations.\n\nThese weaknesses, in my opinion, lead to significant doubt on the soundness of the discussed results and therefore contribute to my decision leading towards rejection. Nevertheless, if I misunderstood any significant pieces of this work, or if some of these weaknesses are void, I am happy to be convinced otherwise if the appropriate evidence is provided.\n\n### References\n\n[1] Sheth, Ivaxi, and Samira Ebrahimi Kahou. \"Overcoming Interpretability and Accuracy Trade-off in Medical Imaging.\"\u00a0*Medical Imaging with Deep Learning, short paper track*. 2023.\n\n[2] Collins, Katherine Maeve, et al. \"Human uncertainty in concept-based ai systems.\"\u00a0*Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society*. 2023.\n\n[3] Zarlenga, Mateo Espinosa, et al. \"Learning to Receive Help: Intervention-Aware Concept Embedding Models.\"\u00a0*arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.16928*\u00a0(2023)."

            "questions": {
                "value": "The following questions, in no particular order, would help clarify some of the doubts on this work. If possible, I would appreciate it if the authors could elaborate on these concerns as they may serve as a good starting point for a discussion during rebuttal:\n\n1. Could you please elaborate on the seemingly contradicting baseline results discussed in the weaknesses? In particular, for the CEM interventions, the shown results seem to match the interventions in CEMs when `RandInt` is not used for training (something the authors explicitly discuss is necessary for interventions to work properly). Is it the case that you trained CEMs with RandInt? I tried to look for code as part of this submission but could not find it in the supplement (please let me know if I missed it; in which case, I am very sorry for that!).\n2. Related to the question above, which dataset is used in the evaluation of Figure 2? Is this CUB? I could not find this information anywhere. Also, when intervening on a bottleneck, are interventions performed on groups of concepts or on individual concepts at a time? In CUB, in particular, most previous work focuses on group-level interventions, so clarifying this is very important. Based on the left-most plot in Figure 1 increasing linearly, I am assuming interventions are done at an individual level rather than at a group level, but clarifying this is very important.\n3. Similarly, could you please elaborate on how ECBMs fare against competing baselines when intervened on in the other datasets?\n4. Could you please elaborate on the lack of results for PCBMs and ProbCBMs given my comments on the weaknesses indicating that they are in fact baselines that could be evaluated in the setups used in this paper?\n5. Could you please elaborate more on the specifics of the negative sampling strategy used to learn $E^\\text{global}_\\theta$? This is a critical practical element of this method and including details for this is crucial if you want to ensure reproducibility. Furthermore, understanding how this is done to scale for large concept spaces is extremely important to understand some of the limitations of this work.\n6. The outer summation of Preposition 3.2 is very unclear. It seems to be \u201citerating\u201d over all concept vectors without considering the $k$-th dimension, but it is not immediately clear if this is the case or whether these vectors are what $\\mathbf{c}$ is referred to inside the summation. Can you please clarify what are this summation\u2019s bounds and iteration variables?\n7. When learning the positive and negative embeddings for each concept, I was wondering if you have an intuition as to what inductive bias in your model is responsible for forcing the distribution of positive and negative embeddings to be easily separable? For example, in ProbCBMs the use of a contrastive loss with two \u201canchor\u201d embeddings leads to this separation. Similarly, in CEMs the use of RandInt at training-time leads to this separation.  Understanding this is crucial for understanding why a given model performs well or badly when intervened on and may help clarify the design choice/process of this architecture to future readers hoping to build on top of this work.\n\nBesides these questions, I found the following typos/minor errors that, if fixed, could improve the quality of the current manuscript:\n\n1. In section 3.2 (page 5), \u201cthe second terms\u201d should be \u201cthe second term\u201d\n2. In section 3.3 (page 6), \u201dProposition 3.2 below compute\u201d should be \u201cProposition 3.2 below computes\u201d\n3. In proposition 3.2, the variable $k$ is already captured when using $c_k$ but it is then overwritten in the summation over all concepts in the RHS\u2019s numerator that uses $k$ again to indicate the iteration index. The same applies for propositions 3.4 and 3.5!\n4. In section 3.4 (page 6), \u201cProposition 3.3 below compute\u201d should be \u201cProposition 3.3 below computes\u201d"

The authors identify three key issues with conventional CBMs, namely their inability to capture high-order interactions between concepts, quantify complex conditional dependencies, and strike a balance between interpretability and performance.\n\nThe proposed ECBMs leverage neural networks to define a joint energy function for input, concept, and class label tuples. This unified interface allows for the representation of class label prediction, concept correction, and conditional interpretation as conditional probabilities, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior."

However, given the context of CBMs, i want to have the following criticism:\n\n1. The second gap: Given the class label and one concept, the probability of predicting another concept? is not clear \n2. Incomplete literature review. The authors should add the following papers as each of them has a unique perspective to solve the problem.\n\n[1] Interpretable Neural-Symbolic Concept Reasoning. Barberio et al.

How does each of three conditional probabilities - p(y|x), p(c-k|x, ck), and p(ck|y, ck\u2032)\u2014mitigate the 3 limitations - Interpretability, Intervention, Performance? \n4. How does this method impact label free CBM or Language in a bottle kind of framework? There concepts are retrieved from the language model. because in more realistic setting like medical images having ground truth concepts is expensive.\n5. I believe this is an inherently interpretable method. How to integrate it in a posthoc setting like PCBM? Also, if it can be integrated in a posthoc setting, i would like to see the comparison of completeness scores.\n6. There is a new notion of difficulty estimation for samples using concept bottleneck models in . Can the energy based models be extended to that?\n7. One limitation of concept bottleneck models is the limited applicability in a real-life scenario. I would like to see one experiment on an application - for example shortcut identification as in [4] and Discover and Cure: Concept-aware Mitigation of Spurious Correlation. Wu et al. ICML 2023\n8. Also, there is a problem of leakage in CBM as in [3]. Will the ECBM be helpful in that regard? If the authors can show ECBM is better for the experiments depicted in fig. 2 and 3 in [3], this paper will be very strong.\n\n\nOverall, the contribuition of energy based method for CBM is novel. However, the x-ai community has identified the two setbacks of concept bottleneck models - 1) the cost of getting the ground truth concepts (for inherently interpretable setup) 2) the concepts are purely correlation not causal (for posthoc setup), so it is not guranteed if the concepts are actually utilized by the blackbox. This paper does not answer this two core research gap through their method as how ECBMs can help in either of the two question is still not clear to me.\n\n**Extremely pleased with response from the authors and especially with the leakage experiments. This paper deserves a 7 for sure and 8 is too high. So i am increasing my score**"

                "value": "1. I find it difficult to fully embrace the idea of Concept Bottleneck Modeling (CBM) presented in this paper, as well as in prior research, due to the absence of a clear definition for the term \"concepts.\" From my perspective, what is referred to as \"concepts\" in this context appears to be nothing more than additional labels or explicit features that can be readily discerned by humans. However, one of the notable advantages of deep learning networks lies in their ability to automatically extract features, even those that may not be easily identifiable by humans. Consequently, I believe that the primary reason for the observed decline in performance of CBMs, when compared to recent work such as [1] on CUB, is that the model is exclusively directed towards learning these so-called \"concepts\" and neglects the acquisition of features that can be explicitly identified.\n2. There missing baseline models that are not based on CBM in the experiments.\n3. There missing ablation study on the proposed method with only a single branch, i.e, the 'concepts' branch and the 'class' branch as shown in Figure 1.\n4. The \"related work\" section about energy-based models is not complete. It misses some pioneering works and representative works to build a full history of the advancement of EBMs. For example, [2] [3] are pioneering EBM works, [4] also use an EBM for the distribution of labels (or other information) and data, which also captures high-level concepts and data. It is better to have a comparative discussion on both models if they share a similar concept. \n\n[1] Progressive co-attention network for fine-grained visual classification. 2021 International Conference on Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP).

As demonstrated in Table 1, the gap in performance between CBM and ECBM is noticeably smaller on the AWA2 dataset compared to that observed on the CUB and CelebA datasets. Is there any explanation for this phenomenon?\n2. How can the model ensure a stable solution during inference while searching for the optimal values of 'c' and 'y'? Is there any complexity analysis in B.1.\n3. Is it possible for the model to detect undefined 'concepts,' or is it capable of exploring new 'concepts'?"
