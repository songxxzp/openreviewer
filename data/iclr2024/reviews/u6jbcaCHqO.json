The reviewer would like to know why the authors did not try the combination of external tools and zero-shot learning.\n- In the experiment, if the LLM responses were within a relative error of 0.05 as a numerical value, they were considered to be correct. On the other hand, as shown in the center of Figure 1, there are cases where the numerical calculation is wrong even though the idea or formula itself is correct, and cases where the numerical calculation is correct by chance but the idea or formula is false. In this evaluation setup, the former case is simply considered wrong, while the latter case is correct.

What would be the result if the same error analysis was applied to answers that are numerically correct? This involves two aspects:\n  - First, it is possible to find numerically correct answers that contain some errors listed in section 5.\n  - Also, it would be even better if there was also an evaluation of error analysis for numerically correct responses, while it has been reported that about 20% of error analysis by LLM for numerically incorrect responses are discarded."

For instance, regarding the observation \"The zero-shot learning setting exhibits comparable performance to the few-shot learning setting,\" did the author conduct comprehensive testing on different in-context examples to ascertain consistent findings? Different qualities of few-shot examples may yield different results. High-quality prompts and in-context examples should help stimulate the model's capabilities."

What specific attempts have been made, and could it be due to inadequate adjustments to the prompts? It would be more appropriate to refrain from drawing such a statement without further investigation.\n\n2. On page8, third line from the bottom, is it written incorrectly? Is \"15.2% of casual ability\" referring to the zero-shot setting?\n\n3. Few-shot prompting leads to a trade-off in skills. Is this due to the content of the example prompts? Can it be resolved by replacing few-shot examples?"
