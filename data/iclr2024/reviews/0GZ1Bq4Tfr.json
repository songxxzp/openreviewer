                "value": "The authors study the role of weight decay (wd) in deep learning. They argue that WD can be harmful since 1) the WD update and gradient update are calculated in parallel, and 2) the nonlinearities in the networks mean that the output from nonlinear layers is not scaled down linearly. The authors propose a few variants of WD. 1) RWD (eq. 7) where the WD terms account for the gradient updated, 2) PWD where the WD update seems to be computed before the gradient update, and 3) PWD where the WD coefficient changes per layer. Experimentally, the authors consider finetuning SWIN and ConvNext models from TIMM on Cifar datasets. The authors generally find that their proposed methods lead to small improvements. Some ablation experiments are also provided."

To address these issues, the authors propose RWD (Real-time Weight Decay) and PWD (Progressive Weight Decay). LPWD combines these methods with a layer-wise weight decay rate strategy. Empirical validation on datasets like Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 using models such as ConvNext and SwinTransformer demonstrates the robustness and improved generalization of LPWD over traditional methods."
