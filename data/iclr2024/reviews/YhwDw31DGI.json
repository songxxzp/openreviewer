MIP instance clustering has already been studied in the literature, e.g., in [Kadioglu2010] and [Song2023]. These approaches can already effectively clustering heterogeneous MIP instances, and the techniques are much simpler than the proposed one. The authors did not give a proper discussion and comparison regarding existing MIP clustering methods.\n\n[Kadioglu2010] Kadioglu, S., Malitsky, Y., Sellmann, M., & Tierney, K. (2010).

Section 4.2, \"suggests that the generated scaling instances closely match those of the large-scale training dataset\". I cannot tell.\n\nMain questions/comments:\n1. In the experiment section, one of the main target should be to examine whether the generated MIP instances still preserve the combinatorial structure of MIS, CA, and MVC. The approaches you mentioned like MIP solver performance, graph statistics can give good estimation, but more importantly, is there any way to directly verify if the generated MIP instances are still also MIS, CA, or MVC? I believe that some auxiliary polynomial time algorithms can be given to check if a MIP instance is the MIP formulation of MVC (or MIS, CA). Then you can run the algorithm over all MIP instances, and report the percentage of generated instances that still preserve the exactly combinatorial structure of the benchmark problems.\n2. In table 3, here you are comparing the objective value of the best available solution within a fixed time limit. Have you tried comparing the solving time to reach optimality?\n3. Section 4.1.1. \"Our experiment confirms that the generated MIP in stances have similar solving difficulty to the original input problem\": I'm not sure about that. As far as I can see, the solving difficulty of the original input problem is not similar to the 100% version. \n4. Section 4.1.1. \"as the reconstruction percentage surges, more and more math structures in the problem are destroyed.\" Here you make the assumption that, more math structures will increase the solving difficulty of the MIP problem. However, this is not necessarily true. Adding constraints with random non-zero coefficients at every variable can also significantly increase the solving difficulty but it has no math structure as well."

First, only graph modularity may not be sufficient to gauge the graph fidelity and more metrics are necessary to ensure a comprehensive similarity comparison. Second, the whole MIPGen are complex with many heavy modules. The simple instance generation ought to be compared to underscore the effect of MIPGen. For example, simply fitting the degrees and parameters in instances into a distribution that may be already enough to generate new instances.\n\nThe key techniques in this paper are not novel. The bipartite graph neural network still follows an early work, which can not well differentiate the integer and continuous variables. Moreover, there is no MIP but only IP instances in MIS, CA, MVC.

                "value": "This paper proposes a MIP instance generation method. It first clusters the MIPs, and applies the node splitting-and-merging process. It also proposes to concatenate tree structures to get larger problems. Experiments show that the generated MIPs are similar to the original ones and can enhance the solution effect of the ML-based framework."

In the split-and-merge process, the constraints and varaiables features are not newly generated. So it is more appropiate for generating SATs instead of MIPs.\n1. The considered graph statistics are only for structures, but not for coefficients. So the authors should consider new metrics for MIPs instead of SATs.\n1. The authors may want to add some baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness.\n1. A recent work [1], which appears in NeurIPS2023, also uses deep learning to generate MIPs. So this paper is not the first one for this topic.\n\n\n[1] [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02807.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02807.pdf)"

Among the considered three datasets, MIS has all coefficients as 1, so it can be learned by the split-and-merge method like SAT problems. Do the other datasets have this characteristic?\n1. How long is the fixed wall time in Table 1? What do not report the solving time of the instances?\n1. What is the meaning of the reconstruction percentage?"
