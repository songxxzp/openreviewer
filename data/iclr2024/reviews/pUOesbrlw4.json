                "value": "This paper focuses on the question of whether we can unlearn one or more classes from a well-trained model if only a few samples are accessible from the training data of a large dataset. To address this question, the authors propose a novel singular value decomposition-based class unlearning method. This work first estimates the retain space and forget space of the model layer by layer based on the singular value decomposition technique, and then removes the shared information between spaces from the forget space to isolate the class-discriminatory feature space for unlearning, and finally, projects the model weights in the orthogonal direction of the class-discriminatory space to obtain the unlearned model. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets as well as VGG11, ResNet18, and ViT models. They also display the applicability of their method in two practical scenarios of multi-class unlearning."

By decomposing the feature space of each layer of the well-trained model, the features of the unlearn class are eliminated while reducing the impact on the features of the retained classes. The experimental evaluations in the paper also provide evidence to support the claims made in the paper. In particular, there are verifications on the large datasets ImageNet and ViT. However, the method also has some unclear aspects that I mentioned below.\n\n**Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written. However, there is room for improvement as I mention below."

The authors only describe the representations collection of linear and convolutional layers, but how to deal with the transformer layer, BatchNorm, etc.?\n2. The authors perform SVD operation based on the representations matrix of $X_r$ and $X_f$. Do the sample size and sampling strategy of $X_r$ and $X_f$ affect the results of the algorithm?\n3. Why did the authors consider designing importance-base space scaling? Won't this cause the deformation of the forget space and retain space?\n4. The choice of best $\\alpha$ in Eq.(1) seems to be a trick as different datasets give different $\\alpha$ sets. Is there a more reasonable way to choose, like learnable $\\alpha$?\n\n\n**Experiments:**\n1. The authors mention that the experimental results come from 10 different target unlearning classes, and CIFAR-100 is evaluated for every 10th. Does it mean that the [10, 20, \u2026, 100]-th class was used as an unlearning class to conduct the experiment?\n2. Does the \"Original\" represent the well-train model? Are the results reported on all retain and forget classes?\n3. How is the classification head designed? For example, for CIFAR-100, the classification head of the well-train model outputs a 100-dimensional vector. What about the unlearning model?\n4. In Figure 4, the proposed method does not have an advantage in efficiency compared to the Tarun et al. (2023)? Could the authors provide further analysis?\n5. While I think the multi-class forgetting experiment is interesting, what the authors provide is not sufficient. First, simply conducting experiments on CIFAR10 is not convincing. Second, the effects of baselines were not compared. Third, the result analysis is insufficient. For example, why is the original model of resnet18 better in Figure 5a, but not as good as the unlearning model in Figure 5b?"

This paper only evaluates the effectiveness of the method based on the classification accuracy of forgetting and retaining classes. Have the authors considered verification metrics with more theoretical guarantees? If the forgetting class is known, the output probability of the forgetting class can be forced to 0 without changing the model parameters to ensure the effect of forgetting and retaining classes, but this approach is obviously contrary to the motivation of unlearning."

In this work, aninstantiation of SVD is used to separate out the \u2018forget space\u2019 (the \u2018space\u2019 in which the activations of samples belonging to the forget set lie) from the \u2018retain space\u2019 (analogously, for retain samples). These spaces are obtained by running SVD on activations (retain or forget) from all layers of the network. The authors show that a small subset of the retain and forget sets suffices for obtaining these activations. Once the forget space is identified, the model weights are updated by a projection to a space that removes forget set information.\nThe authors also use a baseline that they refer to as Stable Ascent (which was proposed in recent work). Interestingly, they show that both this baseline and their proposed method surpass the previous state-of-the-art in the context of class unlearning on some benchmarks, with their proposed method making further progress over Stable Ascent. They investigate empirically different scenarios (different datasets and architectures, removal of one or more classes either in one-go or sequentially) and report both quantitative results (accuracies) and qualitative ones (gradcam heatmaps to visualize feature saliency)."

What are application scenarios for class unlearning? While the authors have motivated the problem of unlearning well, motivation of missing for class unlearning in particular.\n- the authors claim that Stable Ascent is one of the contributions of the paper but this baseline has already been proposed in previous work that the authors did not cite ([A] \u2013 see References below, where it is referred to as NegGrad+ and the authors of that work also find that it is a strong baseline, surpassing previous SOTA in several scenarios)\n- recent unlearning methods are missing from the Related Work section, e.g. [A, B, C, D] (see References below), and it would also significantly strengthen the paper to empirically compare against them too.  \n- ablations are missing. For example, how large is the contribution of the proposed scaling? It would be good to investigate a version of the proposed method without this. Further, how important is it to use activations from all layers for SVD versus just the top layer(s)?\n- also, it would be good to motivate the scaling a bit more. Is such a scaling used in the continual learning literature / related methods? If not, what is different about this application that necessitates it?\n- the evaluation is lacking. While several evaluation metrics are used for unlearning, the authors rely primarily on accuracy metrics. A particularly important class of evaluation techniques that is missing is membership inference attacks (see e.g. the papers by Golatkar et al, which are cited in this work, and also see [A] from the references below)\n- In fact, the evaluation metrics seem to be at odds with the goal of class unlearning that the authors state in the Introduction, namely that \u201cthe unlearning algorithm should produce parameters that are equivalent to those of a model trained without the target class\u201d. Despite this definition, the authors don\u2019t look at proximity in weight space or related metrics and instead rely primarily on accuracy.\n- In section 3, the description of the problem of class unlearning isn\u2019t precise enough. It\u2019s defined as producing a set of unlearned parameters such that two conditions (test retain examples are correctly classified and test forget examples incorrectly classified) are satisfied for \u2018many samples\u2019. But how many samples? Usually, the accuracy on each of those two sets is desired to be just as high/low as it would be for retrain-from-scratch. Is there a reason that this is not the definition used? Also, how come this definition refers only to test examples? Usually it is also desired to have similar conditions hold for the training set (retain and forget partitions).\n- clarity: the algorithm is presented in terms of linear and convolutional layers. But in their experiments, the authors also use Transformers. It\u2019s not directly obvious how the proposed method is used for attention layers.\n- clarity: \u201cfor both linear and convolutional layers, where l is a layer and i is retain sample \u201d \u2013 i was not mentioned in that context. \n\nMinor issues and typos\n==================\n- \u2018produce parameters that are equivalent to those of a model trained without the forget set\u2019 \u2013 not clear what the word \u2018equivalent\u2019 means here.\n- \u2018Generalization on retain samples\u2019 \u2013 this is a little confusing as the retain set is part of the training set, so generalization isn\u2019t an appropriate term (as it refers to held-out samples). \u2018accuracy\u2019 or \u2018performance\u2019 are more appropriate.\n- \u2018we asks the question\u2019 \u2192 \u2018we ask the question\u2019\n- \u2018this section focus\u2019 \u2192\u2018this section focuses\u2019\n- \u2018sorted in by the amount \u2192\u2018sorted by the amount\u2019 \n- \u2018the samples form class to be retained\u2019 \u2192\u2018the samples from the class\u2019\n- In several places, some articles are missing, and there are more typos than these mentioned here. \nPlease proofread the paper and check for grammatical errors.\n\nReferences\n==========\n- [A] Towards Unbounded Machine Unlearning.

Why is that?\n- in figure 5b, why are the confidence intervals so large? Can we draw any meaningful conclusions from this figure?\n- why is the reference point / oracle of Retraining not included in all tables? Is this because it is too computationally expensive to compute this for some models / datasets?

Subsequently, the shared information between these spaces is computed and selectively removed from the Forget Space, thus isolating the class-discriminatory feature space for the unlearning process. Ultimately, the model weights are projected in the orthogonal direction of the class-discriminatory space, resulting in the derivation of the unlearned model."

                "value": "1. There is a more fundamental question about the class unlearning setup. The whole point of unlearning is to replicate a completely retrained model in parameter space or in output space  Now for the preliminary section 3 it is mentioned that for an unlearned model the output label of a datapoint belonging to an unlearned class, is not a true label in this case the unlearned class i.e. y_i != f(x_i,\\theta_f). Why is this the case? Is it not that the unlearned model output should be exact/almost the same as the retrained model? If the retrained model gives output as the true label on very few samples why unlearned model can\u2019t give output the same? In other terms,. if the retrained model gives accuracy let's say 3% on the test forget set and the unlearning model also gives similar accuracy on the forget set. The unlearning method is valid. So, I think the y_i != f(x_i,\\theta_f) can be formulated in better probabilistic terms so that it matches the retrained model. The implicit assumption is that for a retrained model the accuracy on the forget set if 0 is not correct. We can set adversarial examples such that the retrained model gives an accuracy of 100% on the forget set."
