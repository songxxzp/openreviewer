Thus, learnable latent variance is among the causes of posterior collapse, opposite to the results in Wang & Ziyin (2022) that it is not the cause of posterior collapse.\" This warrants some explanation. Why is the conclusion opposite? \n- What does it mean for Sigma to be unlearnable? This isn't properly explained. \n- What is the meaning of Theorem 1? It isn't yet clear to me what we are proving or why? \n- \"We note that our results generalize Theorem 1 in (Wang & Ziyin, 2022) where \u03c3i\u2019s are all equal to a constant.\" It would really be helpful to the reader to present the previous result and explain clearly why. \n- Ok the explanation after the theorem is helpful.

It would be nice to see more theoretical motivation for why these results might generalize to more realistic training settings, but instead that is largely directed towards prior work.\n- Even in the empirical setting the majority of models studied are restricted to fairly shallow networks. The results are entirely on a simple dataset, MNIST, and therefore it\u2019s hard to get a sense for how the experiments would behave in a more complex setting with deeper networks, modern architectures, and less standardized data.\n- One of the most noticeable absences is that this paper doesn\u2019t consider the effects of SGD and optimization strategies. The setting where global solutions are directly obtainable is not really representative of most real world VAEs which would involve deep nonlinear networks that are most likely to only reach a local optimum. While the experiments themselves do use Adam to train the models, there\u2019s not much analysis of how the optimization strategy interacts with other phenomena.\n- Many of these weaknesses could be levied against prior work in this space. For what it\u2019s worth this paper does go beyond those works in that they do rigorous theoretical analysis of more complex model types."

Maybe the functional form of the result is identical but the authors have more general assumptions on $\\sigma_i$ (I doubt this after having scanned the proof in Wang & Ziying). In either case, the statement that this theorem is one of the novel contributions is false or at best misleading.\n- **It is unclear how much novelty there is in extending the proof to CVAEs and MHVAEs.** Since I did not follow the proof for theorem 2 and 3 closely, and I am also not familiar with the literature, I cannot be certain whether extending the existing results on linear VAEs to CVAEs and MHVAEs is methodologically novel. In particular, the expression for $\\omega^*$ in theorem 2 seems quite similar to that of theorem 1 (which I do not consider novel, see previous point), and it is unclear to me if the derivation follows almost identical strategies. I think it might be helpful if the authors can discuss why extending the proof to the CVAE and MHVAE cases are interesting and nontrivial. This might just be a minor concern as one can argue that the implications of the results might be the more important and interesting aspect of this work.\n- **Graphics are not very easy to read.** It is difficult to see how the results shown in the plots support the theoretical results. This is only a minor critique and can be easily improved by using a different coloring scheme or just rearranging the labels in a vertical list and/or remind the reader what the theoretical predictions are (larger $\\beta1$ and smaller $\\beta2$ is good, etc.)."

                "value": "This work provides a theoretical analysis of posterior collapse in Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. First the authors extend previous results for the linear VAE case (Variational Autoencoders with only a single linear layer as encoder and decoder) and provide a novel condition for posterior collapse. Then these results are extended and the authors provide conditions for posterior collapse for two further VAE models: the Conditional VAE (CVAE), and the Markovian Hierarchical VAE (MHVAE)."

                "value": "This work provides important theoretical insights into the conditions for posterior collapse in Variational Autoencoders. Although these conditions are only presented for the linear case, and for MHVAE the case that only one of the two encoder variances is learnable, this work provides an important step forward for the understanding of the inner workings of VAEs and provides the basis and theoretical tool set for future research. The empirical evaluation confirms that the theoretical insights gained for the single layer encoder and decoder case extend, at least empirically, to the nonlinear (multi layer) case."

Yet, I believe that the work provides an important step forward in the understanding of VAEs and do not see a big drawback in this."
