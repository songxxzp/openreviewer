                "value": "The paper introduces a contrastive learning framework called CARE, which stands for Contrastive Augmentation-induced Rotational Equivariance. CARE extends the InfoNCE loss by including a term that enforces an equivariant constraint with respect to the image transformations employed during training, as opposed to the traditional contrastive learning that attempts to induce invariance.\n\nThe central concept behind CARE is to ensure that transformations in the input space correspond to local orthogonal transformations in the representation space, a property known as orthogonal equivariance. This is achieved by minimizing a loss term (L_equi) that encourages the angles between pairs of images and their transformed counterparts to remain ideally the same, thus promoting orthogonal equivariance. The authors show theoretically that satisfying their proposed loss (i.e., L_equi = 0) implies orthogonal equivariance. \n\nTo avoid a common issue where all data points collapse to the same location in the representation space, the authors introduce an additional term (L_uni) inspired by the work of Isola and Wang. L_uni encourages representations within a batch to be evenly distributed. However, the combination of L_equi and L_uni alone underperforms compared to traditional contrastive learning frameworks like SimCLR. To address this, the authors introduce a term (L_inv) traditionally used to induce invariance with respect to the applied transformations. The final loss function comprises these three terms: \\lambda * L_equi (minimize angle differences) + L_inv (minimize differences among positive pairs) + L_uni (maximize uniformity).\n\n\u2028The authors assess CARE on a protein point cloud dataset (Protein Data Bank), they also demonstrate that CARE can better induce orthogonal equivariance compared to SimCLR using metrics like Whaba's problem and Relative Rotational Equivariance applied to the embedding of a Resnet-18 architecture trained on CIFAR-10. They qualitatively compare CARE and SimCLR in an image retrieval task, and finally evaluate CARE against SimCLR, MoCo-V2, and BYOL in the linear probing image classification task on various datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and ImageNet100."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I think this work has some interesting intuitions and hope that if it is not accepted the authors will continue to make it stronger. While I like the idea of mixing invariance and equivariance I think this work could be strengthened by a more thoughtful use of the contrastive framework and a more solid experimental evaluation. Let me elaborate on both these points. Since the experimental evaluation is, in my opinion, a more impactful weakness I start there, and follow with the use of the contrastive framework. \n\nThe experimental protocols should be improved in order to highlight the benefit of CARE. Results are not clearly showing why one should adopt CARE, some key experiments for this work are missing (transfer learning), and other experiments do not seem comparable with previously presented results.  Specifically,\n\n- The experiments that use the Wahba\u2019s Problem and the Relative Rotation Equivariance should contain some stronger baselines. Wouldn't the authors say that it is expected that CARE achieves better results in terms of equivariance compared to SimCLR (that does not try to achieve orthogonal equivariance)? SimCLR could be a lower bound but it is difficult to say if the results shown by CARE are \"good\" as no other strong comparison is provided. A stronger result would be to show that CARE is comparable or superior to other equivariant inducing algorithms. \n\n- The results on linear probing seems to report results on a not very common setting (training on CIFAR-10, 100, STL, ImageNet100, as opposed to training on ImageNet or ImageNetTiny and testing a linear probe on those datasets). For example see table Table 3 of BYOL, or Table 8 of SimCLR , or Table 3 (RRC column) of Duet. All these results were obtained training on ImageNet and testing on other datasets (including Cifar10 and Cifar100) and report much stronger results. I believe these results (i.e. Transfer Learning) are crucial for this work because they could support the claim that by using equivariance one can learn more generic and transferable features. Training and testing on the same dataset it is less interesting in my opinion. \n\n- Even for the few results that can be found about training SimCLR on CIFAR-10 (for example) the results reported seem below previously reported numbers. The original SimCLR paper reports results on CIFAR 10 in the Appendix and the accuracy is 94% (compared to 90.98%). My experience with contrastive frameworks is that once the pre-training pipeline is optimized and the training scales up (in terms of datasets, batch size, and epochs) the initial advantages one might observe by tweaking the model reduce until they (very often) disappear altogether. It would be great to show that this does not happen with equivariance.\n\n- On the protein point clouds experiments I find unclear to assess what is the desired (correct) trajectory. Perhaps this is due to my lack of experience with this protein task but the manuscript could explain more clearly what is the expected result (Figure 3). Also, it is known that SimCLR requires large batches (hence large datasets), I am not familiar with this dataset but what I wonder if its size makes it a suitable application for pre-training with SimCLR. Maybe a better test would be to pre-train on a larger dataset and fine tune on this dataset?\n\n- Similarly, the qualitative results on the image retrieval tasks are difficult to assess. I thought the results from SimCLR were better. This task should be explained more clearly and it would be even better to employ some quantitative evaluation (if possible). I also do not fully understand what is the role of the \u201cinput\u201d compared to that of the \u201cquery\u201d. \n\nIn terms of the contrastive learning framework, if I understand correctly all three terms of the proposed algorithm act on the same representation space (after projection head). This however introduces an ambiguity: is the objective to induce invariance or equivariance? While it is true that invariance satisfies equivariance it is also true that satisfying equivariance through invariance leads to the loss of information typical of the invariance-inducing algorithms (as the authors correctly mention in the paper). It is also why the common contrastive learning algorithms based on invariance impose this constraint after the projection head but use the representation before (where \"hopefully\" invariance is not achieved strongly). Therefore, while the equivariance idea is great and the use of angles is an interesting idea, its application seems to have \"just\" a regulation effect (especially given that the \\lambda value is so small). A more interesting (albeit I recognize this comment falls in the realm of speculations) use of the contrastive framework would be to impose equivariance on the embedding before the projection head (the embedding that are actually used for downstream tasks) and invariance after the projection head. By doing so, one can hope to take full advantage of the equivariant properties while still leveraging the constructive learning framework and the benefit of the invariance loss."

                "value": "My question mostly revolve around the weaknesses listed above. Is there any misunderstanding in the list I provided above?\n\nIn addition\n- Would you agree that it make sense to compare Wahba\u2019s Problem and the Relative Rotation Equivariance with another equivariance inducing method (in addition to SimCLR which is not inducing equivariance)? And that without this comparison it's difficult to assess \"how good\" the results shown are.\n- Would you be able to provide transfer learning results? Would you agree that those are ideal to show that CARE is learning more generic features?\n- Could you resolve the issue on the CIFAR-10 classification results? Why SOTA report 94% accuracy while your version is at 90%?\n- Could you provide more clarity on the protein folding experiment? \n- Could you provide more clarity (and maybe quantitative metrics) on the image retrieval task?\n- One of the claim is that CARE can handle composition of transformations but it is unclear if there is any experiment that support this claim. I understand that this can be proven theoretically, however, L_equi is never zero and its contribution if further reduced by the \\lambda factor, hence in practice it remains to be seen if CARE can handle equivariance of composition of transformations. Or is it the case that the augmentations are random resize crop + rotation, hence the equivariance is achieved for the combination of these two?\n- Lastly, not a question but I hope you take on the suggestion of trying to impose the equivariance constraint on the embeddings used for downstream task rather than the one after the projection head."

Conceptual explanations are clear, theoretical\n  results are precisely phrased and explained (mercifully, the representation\n  theory is kept to an absolute minimum, which seems uncommon in this area), and\n  the general writing is engaging and compelling.\n\n- The experimental evaluation is solid: it proposes reasonable metrics to assess\n  learned equivariance, shows that CARE improves over baselines on these\n  metrics, demonstrates improved linear probe performance at reasonable scale,\n  and gives some useful ablations in the appendix.\n\n- The inclusion of a theoretical (mostly conceptual-type) basis for the method\n  is valuable, and completes a well-rounded presentation of the method and its\n  motivations."

                "value": "- The use of both an invariant and equivariant loss in the overall objective\n  function seems conceptually strange (although the ablations show it leads to\n  superior performance). I would like to understand what might be being learned\n  with this combination of losses -- my reading of the explanation in section 3\n  is that, among embeddings that *minimize* the equivariant regularizer (following\n  proposition 1), those that achieve a small invariant loss will prefer small,\n  rather than large, orthogonal transformations. However, it is not clear to me\n  why this setting should arise in experiments -- why not a situation where the\n  invariance loss is minimized, and the equivariant regularizer is only small?\n  I am also unsure how this connects with the discussion in the \"Relative\n  rotational equivariance.\" paragraph later.\n\n\n- It would be ideal if the authors could assert theoretically some degree of\n  approximate invariance given approximate minimization of their regularizer\n  (see a comment to this effect below). It seems important to precisely\n  understand what happens in this setting, given the fact that a mixture of\n  equivariant and invariant losses are required for strong practical\n  performance.\n\n\n### Minor issues\n\n- After equation (4): better to not reference a figure in the appendix without\n  adding something like \"In the appendix, we show ...\"\n\n- The claim after Proposition 1 that \"[c]onsequently, low [CARE] loss converts\n  'unstructured' augmentations in input space to have a structured geometric\n  interpretation as rotations in the embedding space\" does not seem to follow\n  from Proposition 1 or the preceding discussion (since the proposition requires\n  exact minimization of the loss, rather than just a low value). It is not clear\n  to me that the proof generalizes, because it relies on an external result from\n  invariant theory (which might be algebraic).\n\n- Bottom of page 5: principle -> principal"
