However, although cross-domain shifts and spurious-correlation shifts are two important real-world distributions, the lack of spurious dataset has left a gap in this important research area. In this paper, the authors present a new benchmark to accelerate the development of the spurious-correlation few-shot classification problem. Overall, I think it is important to study the spurious-correlation few-shot classification and the authors have done a great job to this area."
