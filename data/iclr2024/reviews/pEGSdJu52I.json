The main drawback here is that the paper's experiments and hypotheses are restricted to two image classification benchmarks (which are widespread - this is still a useful contribution), so it is tricky to assess how well the observations will generalize."

I have some concerns with this claim (i.e. fixed test splits vs resampling), but even assuming this to be true - what can be said for more general machine learning (or even image classification) tasks? For example, in the experiments in Section 4, as the authors note there is a clear correlation between BERT-Large validation performance and test performance. I am not really sure how this should be interpreted in the context of the paper; while the analysis in the paper shows empirically that BERT-Large fine-tuning has more variance than BERT-Base, I don't see how the analysis in the paper would allow one to predict (without running many experiments) whether val performance will be correlated with test performance or not.\n2. **Hyperparameter choices/sensitivity for results.** Of course it is not possible to be entirely comprehensive with respect to hyperparameters, but I have concerns with some choices made by the authors. Particularly, the training horizons considered are 0, 4, 16, and 64 epochs. We see in the experimental results a clear trend of decreasing variance as the training horizons are extended - do any of the results still hold for longer training horizons? I would anticipate that the independence of network predictions surely shrinks as training horizons are extended. \n\n## Minor Comments\n- In the proof of Lemma 1, the exponent should be inside the expectation. Additionally, it's probably helpful to justify the penultimate step (interchange of expectation) by saying that Fubini's Theorem applies.\n- It would be better to include a definition of ECE in Section 3.4, or at least verbally describe it in the context of Hypothesis 2.\n\n## Overall Recommendation\nMy concerns with the paper are mostly with the actual significance of the practical recommendations in the paper (as discussed above). That being said, I think the paper contains sufficiently many interesting ideas and experiments to possibly warrant acceptance (I am borderline because again, I'm not sure how well these ideas generalize). Thus, I recommend **weak accept**."

I suppose it should be the size of the dataset, but it would be nice to include this right by the theorems in order to avoid any possible confusion. \n\n- I think it would be interesting to see the difference in Theorem 3 when varying the number of models in the ensemble. For instance, the bias in the estimate may be small, and a two model ensemble may give good results, or it may actually require quite a large ensemble in order to be close to correct. Can you add this experiment? I believe it can be done by only randomly choosing and expanding the ensemble of the models which are already trained.\n\n- Many of the claims listed as main contributions are in the appendix. Even in the conclusion, the things in the appendix as main contributions which have been demonstrated even though there has been nothing said about them up until this point in the text. I do not think this is fair to the reader and it should be reorganized or rewritten such that this does not happen. \n\n- In section 3.4 it says: \u201cThat is, if we let S \u2032 be the subset of test images which are classified by 30-40% of independently trained networks as \u201cdog\u201d, then approximately 30-40% of the images in S \u2032 really will be dogs.\u201d I do not think that is how calibration is phrased in most calibration works. In fact, all networks may correctly classify the image as a dog (meaning that the highest predicted probability is the dog class), but the predicted probability (confidence) should equal the empirical distribution of the positive class in $S^\\prime$, then the model is calibrated."

This suggests that in practical applications, the variance might not be as concerning as assumed.\n\n- The study puts forth an \"examplewise independence\" hypothesis, suggesting that a network's correct prediction for a given test example is akin to a biased coin flip and is independent of its predictions on other examples.\n\n- The paper states that prior works have noted that predictions from ensembles of networks, trained repeatedly, are typically calibrated. They argue that this calibration inevitably leads to some variance in test-set accuracy. For binary classifications, they provide a formula to determine this variance.\n\n- Other observations include the reduction in distribution-wise variance with longer training durations, the correlation between optimal learning rate and absence of excess distribution-wise variance, the effect of data augmentation in reducing variance, and the increase in variance when test-sets differ from the training set."
