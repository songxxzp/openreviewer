                "value": "This paper aims to increase the transferability of adversarial attacks, by focusing on optimizing the surrogate model rather than the attack objective.\nTo enhance attack transferability, the authors employ SAM (sharpness-aware minimization) to train a surrogate model with a flatter loss landscape w.r.t. parameters so that adversarial attack optimization does not fall into local minima.\n\nThe authors first examine the relationship between non-robust features (Ilyas et al.) and the improvement in transferability resulting from early stopping in surrogate model training. Previous research suggests that \"slightly robust features\" transfer more effectively than non-robust features. However, this paper demonstrates that \"early stopped non-robust features\" transfer better than \"fully-trained non-robust features,\" challenging the existing hypothesis.\n\nNext, they explore the connection between the sharpness of the loss surface with respect to the parameters of a surrogate model and adversarial transferability. Firstly, they demonstrate that the transferability decreases as the learning rate decays during surrogate model training due to an increase in the sharpness of the loss surface. Secondly, they illustrate that using SAM (sharpness-aware minimization), particularly with a larger penalty than the default (denoted as l-SAM in the paper), can enhance transferability. Finally, they show that their method complements existing approaches and further enhances transferability."

The authors' experiments show that \"early-stopped non-robust features\" are more transferable than \"fully-trained non-robust features,\" which is aligned with [Benz et al. 2021] since \"early-stopped non-robust features\" should be more robust than \"fully-trained non-robust features.\" (Anyway, this discussion requires mathematical formulation to discuss precisely.)\n\nW3.

The evaluation experiments are only conducted on standardly trained models. I wonder how l-SAM works when attacking adversarially trained robust models.\n3. As acknowledged in Section 2, the underlying mechanism of SAM is still a popular research topic and remains controversial [1, 2]. In particular, it is still uncertain whether the effectiveness of SAM is caused by sharpness. Therefore, I suggest toning down some claims on the proposed method, such as:\n    \n    > the effect of early stopping on transferability is closely related to the dynamics of the exploration of the loss surface\n    > \n4. In Section 2, I suggest adding more details (e.g. training objective and algorithm) to improve readability, particularly for readers who are not familiar with SAM.\n5. In the context of adversarial robustness, leveraging SAM is not a completely new idea. While I'm not critiquing the novelty of this paper, I think the following papers [3,4] should be mentioned in the related work.\n\n    a. [3] proposes leveraging SAM to craft adversarial examples to find the common weaknesses of different models, which can boost the transferability of adversarial attacks.\n\n    b. [4] shows that using SAM with a larger $\\rho$ (exactly l-SAM in this paper) in standard training can improve adversarial robustness. Additionally, as shown in [5], a little robustness can improve adversarial transferability, so the effectiveness of using SAM in surrogate training is somewhat expected.

                "value": "The weaknesses of this work is listed below:\n\n1. First of all, the teaser figure (Fig. 1) is very confusing. I think the illustration is not clear enough. I cannot extract any information of the \"transferrability\" other than from the texts. I would recommend you to make the training curve in a color system that brighter colors represent high transferability, right now it seems SGD has the best transferability and the early stopping one has the worst. Also, why is this  statistic-based or just sketch map. If it is the latter case, I would recommend the authors to use the former to make this more convincing.\n2. I think both the notion used as well as the literature review of the sharpness for neural network in this work is very limited. First of all, the concept of sharpness has different meanings or evaluation method. Below are a lot of literature that this work missed:\n\n    > [1] Low-Pass Filtering SGD for Recovering Flat Optima in the Deep Learning Optimization Landscape, AISTATS 2022\n\n    > [2] A modern look at the relationship between sharpness and generalization, ICML 2023\n\n    > [3] On large-batch training for deep learning: Generalization gap and sharp minima, ICLR 2017\n\n    > [4]  Fantastic generalization measures and where to find them, ICLR 2020\n\n    > [5] Rethinking parameter counting in deep models: Effective dimensionality revisited (The Hessian-based metrics).\nIn fact, sharpness even has its own meaning in the context of adversarial training:\n\n    > [6] Evaluating and understanding the robustness of adversarial logit pairing.\nTo be frank, I do not believe the SAM-based sharpness is a very good metric for sharpness, and the authors need to prove it is meaningful in the context of adversarial training.\n\n3. If early stopping improves adversarial example's transferability, I think Figure 2 can be removed or moved to Appendix. Also, please improve the presentation by referring to the figure when making arguments. For example, on page 4 paragraph \"Early stopping indeed increases transferability.\", there is no figure referred and it is not friendly to readers.\n\n4. For section 4, I have a general question: what about there is no abrupt learning rate decay used during training, for example the cosine learning rate schedule is very popular in different training settings. Based on this work, does the sharpness always drops during training? This seems a bit odd and contradicts to existing finds saying that better robustness prefers better flatness, see [7] below.\n\n    > [7] Relating Adversarially Robust Generalization to Flat Minima/\n\n5. I think the most significant problem of the evaluation is that, it lacks a serious evaluation on the flatness. For example, the literature [1] provides a list of methods to evaluate the flatness following different metrics. The authors claim better flatness improves tranferability, but forget to measure the flatness. This is not convincing."

The existing view is that there exist two types of features that model learns sequentially. So the early stopping improves transferability of attacks because the features learned first allow for more transferable attacks. The empirical evidence in the paper shows that both types of features show similar behavior with respect to attack success and the early stopping. The proposed conjecture is that transferability success depends on the learning schedule - it is shown empirically that around the LR decay epochs transferability spikes. This is further empirically connected with flatness wrt model parameters and then an approach to train flatter models (with SAM) as surrogate models is evaluated."

Nevertheless, the statement \"when LR decays, the sharpness of the parameter space drops\" (page 5) is not valid overall. Learning rate does not take part in computation of the sharpness and does not affect it. Smaller learning rate is conjectured to drive models to \"sharper\" places, but up till now it is a conjecture. And therefore connection from LR experiments to sharpness experiments are not justified. Moreover it is stated that the success of transferability is related to the exploration of the loss surface (page 5), which is also not a precise statement - even with a large learning rate the trajectory of training can be very limited.\n\nSeveral times the concept of basins of attraction is mentioned (section 5), but it is not precisely defined and it is not explained why this is even useful for the transferability of the attacks. Analogously, several times a very vague term \"initial convergence\" of the training is used. Please define it properly if it is critical for understanding the explanations, or do not use it.\n\nIn the works on adversarial attacks it is very important to describe precisely the attack mode assumed. As I understood, the knowledge of the attacker in the paper is assumed to be almost absolute - so they can train a surrogate model with exactly same architecture, dataset and even training setup. This significantly weakens the challenge of attacking. Moreover, only one type of attack is checked, which might not be enough to make a general conclusion - it might be that exactly BIM attack is affected by the flatness, but PGD for example is not. I would rather suggest to reduce the amount of target architectures checked and the ways to induce the flatness, but add at least one more attack type, that is significantly different from BIM.\n\nThe discussion about robust features and non-robust ones is very convoluted. According to the definition provided it should be very hard to create adversarial attacks on the RF, but if they are learned first then how early stopping can improve transferability? Or it makes it harder to create attacks, but they are more universal? The conclusion on page 4, from the robust and non-robust surrogate models training seems to be inverted: early learned NRFs would have low transferability (since it grows with training), but early learned RFs might be this way. Moreover, the experiment with robust and non-robust surrogate model does not seem to prove that the hypothesis about the sequence of learning process (model first learns RFs and then NRFs) is wrong. We still see that there is a significant difference in the success rate between robust and non-robust features. The conclusion that can be made is rather that early stopping effect on transferability is not connected with robustness of features, but not that the models do not learn some features earlier than others and this does not affect transferability.\n\nThe conclusion made is that flatness of loss surface with respect to the parameters is defining in the transferability of adversarial attacks. While empirical evidence demonstrates validity of such conclusion, I would suggest to be very careful with distinguishing flatness with respect to parameters and optimization with respect to the input that is performed to generate adversarial attacks. First flatness does not necessarily connect with the second, therefore such conclusion may sound misleading.\n\nFinally, measuring only Hessian eigenvalues and trace is not the most precise way to measure sharpness (see for example Petzka, Henning, et al. \"Relative flatness and generalization.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 34 (2021))."
