Specifically, the protein motif, inferred from retrieved MSA profile, is input to the proposed model and both the sequence and structure of the rest region will be returned similar to the masked language models. The main contribution of this paper is the proposed network layer and the newly curated datasets, including beta-lactamase and myoglobin, for evaluating the scaffolding performance. Empirical results on the curated datasets show that the proposed method achieves better performance than baselines in several computational metrics."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Here are my concerns (w/ main questions):\n\n- Regarding the consistency metrics reported, I noticed that the consistency metric of NAEPro in Table 1 (as the main results) underperformed half of the baselines. Since the consistency is defined by comparing the designed structure and predicted structure from designed sequence just similar to scTM/scRMSD, I wonder whether the proposed method captures sequence-structure cross-modality pattern through the mapping of NAEPro.  In particular, by jointly modeling both sequence and structure, one important strength to be expected from NAEPro is its capability of sequence-structure co-awareness and therefore generate more consistent proteins, compared with two-stage models such as RFdiffusion+IF in Table 1. However, such key observation showed conflict with this intuition and greatly weakened the method. The authors can elaborate on this point.\n- For the experiments, how is the model trained to obtain the evaluation digits in Table 1 for each baseline. This is very important because as far as I acknowledged, all the baselines were simply pre-trained on general protein structure datasets such as PDB and CATH, plus the ProteinMPNN(IF). However, in the section 4.2, the author(s) mentioned that NAEPro, the proposed method, is trained on domain-specific dataset from beta-lactamase and myoglobin before inference stage. Do the author believe that such treatments for baseline comparison is fair? To contextualize, most of the protein design or engineering task (antibody/nanobody/enzyme; mutation effect) suffer from lack of domain-specific data, which therefore hinders the use of ML models. The presence of such specific dataset can have a significant effect on the performance of models. Therefore, the result shown in Table 1 may not as strong as it claimed.\n- For the dataset, I found that in section 4.1, the author(s) mentioned that both beta-lactamase and myoglobin datasets are **split randomly.** This is worrying because the entries in PDB can usually be redundant, especially for such large and well-studied families that the authors selected for evaluation. Therefore, to prevent from data leakage, the sequence (even structure, since the structure-based metrics are also involved in this study) has to be redundant-removed by clustering or other strategy. Otherwise, highly similar (such as mutants) even the very same sequences and structures can present both in train and test dataset, making the result in Table 1 rather trivial. The most seemingly influenced metric is AAR, though it is itself questionable to reflect design models. However, due to the abnormally high AAR, other metrics can be biased more or less, due to the ESMFold-folded structures heavily rely on the single input sequence. The author(s) can elaborate on this point. Moreover, in the Table 3 (in appendix), I am curious about the column name \u201cPDB\u201d, does it mean the number of PDB entries (with unique ID) or the number of single chains? Any what is the sequence clustering statistics about the involved two metalloprotein datasets?\n- For the evaluation metrics, the problem to be studied is functional protein (as it is claimed in the title) design instead of general backbone generation(eg., RFDiffusion) or sequence generation (eg., ProteinMPNN). Thus, I found the the five of the metrics fail to (or indirectly if they potentially do) reflect the performance of functional protein design or scaffolding. For the common practice of protein engineering, one may conduct wet-lab validation for the designed candidates (such as in ProteinMPNN) or use a fitness regression model to approximately indicate the success rate of the inference output. All these metrics in Table 1 & 2 show the somehow sequence-structure matching between the predicted and native, but are not very suitable for proteins such as enzyme.\n- The potential theoretical flaw in the equivariance analysis in Section 3.5. To contextualize, the SE(3)-equivariance represents the equivariant property of functions with respect to elements in the special Euclidean group in R^3 which encompass only translation and rotation transformations (or roto-translation equivariance). Corresponding, the special orthogonal group mentioned in Theorem 3.1 also excludes the reflection matrices which has determinant equal to -1. However, in the Theorem 3.1., the author claimed SE(3)-equivariance yet let the proposed NAEL layer be rotation or reflection equivariant. Suppose it is a typo, however, assuming reflection-equivariant property can be problematic for protein structure, because the protein chirality can be important for helical structure."

                "value": "On top of the questions mentioned in the \"Weakness\" section, here are some further questions for the author(s) to answer:\n\n- The proposed architecture encoding both sequence and structure via the masked language modeling (MLM) scheme is somehow interesting. How do the author(s) see the similarity difference between the proposed NAEL layer and tensor field convolutional layer in SE(3)-transformer[1]? For example, in the SE(3)-transformer implementation, one can also enable kNN message passing to save computational overhead. Also, what is the advantage of NAEL over the SeqIPA of the PROTSEED[2], the most competitive baseline in Table 1?\n- In Section 3 - opening paragraph, the author(s) define/formulate the target task as generate a protein sequence and all 3D coordinates of N residues. However, in later model definition, the proposed NAEPro only operates on the C-alpha(CA) coordinates. Please explain this ambiguity. In fact, handling the all-atom coordinates and coarse-grained (CA-only) coordinates can have distinguishable scaling behavior/demand for the parameterized distribution / networks.\n- In section 4.2, the author(s) described that the weights of NAEPro is partially initialized from pretrained ESM2-8M, of the smallest model size among the ESM2 series. This is very problematic but the recent common practices[3,4]  leverage at least the 650M model. Do the author(s) try much larger model size as initialization? I found in the Table 2 that the 8M model has only marginal improvement upon random initialization.\n- How is the \u201ctarget structure\u201d in **evaluation metrics(Section 4.2)** determined? What is the difference between metrics RMSD and consistency?\n\n[1] Fuchs, Fabian, Daniel Worrall, Volker Fischer, and Max Welling. \"Se (3)-transformers: 3d roto-translation equivariant attention networks.\"\u00a0*Advances in neural information processing systems*\u00a033 (2020): 1970-1981.\n\n[2] Shi, Chence, Chuanrui Wang, Jiarui Lu, Bozitao Zhong, and Jian Tang. \"Protein sequence and structure co-design with equivariant translation.\"\u00a0*arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.08761*\u00a0(2022).\n\n[3] Zheng, Zaixiang, Yifan Deng, Dongyu Xue, Yi Zhou, Fei Ye, and Quanquan Gu. \"Structure-informed language models are protein designers.\"\u00a0*bioRxiv*\u00a0(2023): 2023-02.\n\n[4] Verkuil, Robert, Ori Kabeli, Yilun Du, Basile IM Wicky, Lukas F.

Moreover, the evaluation does not include all relevant methods, which makes it too aggressive for the authors to claim in the Introduction that their method \"achieves the HIGHEST...among ALL competitors\" and \"is faster than the FASTEST method\". \n4. Results in Table 1 do not support the superiority of the proposed method. For instance, RMSD>1.7 \\AA means the two structures are different for myoglobin. No matter if the predicted result is 4 \\AA away for 10 \\AA away, neither of them are reliable prediction. For pLDDT, the prediction on $\\beta$-lactamase is ~66%, which is much lower than 80%-90% which is conventionally believed reliable for folding predictions. The TM-score, if they are smaller than 0.5, then the two structures are believed different.

                "value": "1. Page 1: \"The use of separate models for sequence and structure cannot ensure the consistency between the generated sequence and structure.\" I disagree with this statement. Generated protein sequences with higher than 30% identity to the wild-type protein merely change their geometry in space, while existing de novo methods usually generate new sequences with 30-90% sequence identity. Empirically, It has been proven by several recent research that the de novo method can generate new sequences for fixed backbone or desired functions [1-3]. \n2. Page 2: \"knowing the topology of a protein before design process is difficult and also cannot guarantee the designed proteins have the desired functions.\" I disagree with this statement. Although AlphaFold2 cannot predict structures for all proteins with no error, it's a great reference, and designing and screening with it is sufficiently powerful in many research work, including those conducted wet-lab experiments. \n3. Page 2: what is the meaning of \"generally-encoded\" for 20 types of amino acids?\n4. Page 3: \"The selection of motif varies from setting to setting...\" I cannot understand this example regarding the difference between motifs for active sites and binding sites. Can the authors please provide a clearer explanation?\n5. Page 5: \"motif mining\". I don't see the rationale of this module. MSA essentially discovers the conserved sites of a protein sequence by comparing them with other sequences from the same family. However, these conserved sites might not be directly related to its central function. For instance, many conserved sites are buried within the proteins, but functional sites are generally exposed at the surface of the protein. Moreover, the active sites are usually spatially close, but they may distance sequentially. \n6. Page 7: \"evaluation metrics\": ESMFold, as observed by their authors, performs as well as AlphaFold2 when the folded sequence exists in nature. However, for a novel sequence, its prediction is worse than AlphaFold2. Consequently, evaluating novel sequences should use AlphaFold2 instead of ESMFold. \n7.

Which is from NAEPro? Where does the other one come from?\n\n\n\nReference: \n1. Watson et al., De novo design of protein structure and function with RFdiffusion (2023).\n2.
