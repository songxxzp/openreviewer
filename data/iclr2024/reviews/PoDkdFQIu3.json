By defining the shift from a factual state to a counterfactual state under a soft intervention, the counterfactual data can be generated by solving the log-likelihood function as a static state analysis with priors of an \u03c9-dependent Gaussian mixture model. Such a generation method can be used to estimate an ITE and the experimental results of the simulated data show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines in estimating ITE."

The restriction on counterfactual generation that receiving treatment at a time $T_0$ cannot cause any difference reversely to counterfactual generation at $t < T_0$, comes across as self-evident. It remains ambiguous whether prior research infringed upon this constraint. The comparative advantages of the introduced method with the existing work are not distinctly highlighted, leading to a gap in understanding its unique value proposition.\n\n- To evaluate how true synthetic counterfactuals are, more experiments on synthetic datasets including ground-truth counterfactual data are required. It would be insightful to demonstrate the method's robustness under diverse treatment times and over prolonged post-treatment durations. \n\n- The paper could benefit from a rigorous theoretical exploration addressing the method's resilience against noise and confounding bias. Would this be challenging with such a linear framework?\n\n- There is a lack of literature review or an introduction to some of the methods appearing in the experimental part, such as MC-NNM (Athey et al., 2021) and CGP (Schulam and Saria, 2017)."
