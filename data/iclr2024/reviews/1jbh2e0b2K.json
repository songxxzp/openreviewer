The authors prove the theorems by first defining the diversity and consistency between different tasks that the model is going to adapt to, where diversity refers to the coverage of the other tasks on the target task and consistency refers to the similarity between the other tasks and the target task. Then, under some Lipschitzness assumptions, sufficient consistency and diversity assumptions, and sufficient tasks and sufficient sample assumptions (on the finetuning tasks, not the target task), the model with multitask finetuning can achieve a reduced error on the target task compared to the setting without multitask finetuning. Moreover, the authors propose a multitask selection algorithm based on the consistency and diversity requirements. Experimental results indicate that with the proposed multitask selection, the ViT-B model achieves better results on multiple target datasets, and increasing the number of tasks and the number of samples per task are most effective in improving target task performance. Lastly, with multitask finetuning, various pretrained models achieve better results than direct adaptation / standard finetuning on multiple datasets."

My intuition is that, through the training/finetuning on the proxy tasks, the model learns some knowledge related to the target tasks. It is nice that the authors present the theorems that support this intuition, although I didn't verify the proofs. \n- Although the theorems are not directly applicable to real problems, the authors propose a practical Consistency-Diversity Task Selection algorithm, which is effective in experiments. The algorithm is a nice method to try for target task adaption in the real world.\n- The overall experiments are quite extensive and echo the theoretical results, clearly demonstrating the advantages of multitask finetuning over standard finetuning and direct adaptation."

To this end, the authors derive several bounds which indicate that the model with multitask finetuning outperforms that without, and the selected auxiliary tasks should be sufficiently diverse and have good consistency w.r.t. the target task.

It would be more valuable if these bounds could lead to novel insights that were previously overlooked by the community.\n2. Such limitation also lies in the task-selection algorithm, where the authors simply assume a Gaussian distribution of features, then use the angle of mean and variance-scaled L2 distance indicating the consistency and the diversity.\n3.
