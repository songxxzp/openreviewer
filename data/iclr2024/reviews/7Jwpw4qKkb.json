If the prompts are effective, then they are valuable foundations as mentioned in the paper, but if they do not work in the first place how can one find an effective prompt near this ineffective initialization? Besides, if the handcrafted prompt is effective, then why bother finding new ones? \n2. Could you evaluate more defenses as mentioned in the paper 'Baseline defenses for adversarial attacks against aligned language models'?\n3. Please revise the Method section and reorganize the paper. The Method part is so unclear and it seems many important algorithms are in the appendix which further increases the difficulty of understanding the proposed methods."

In this case, all words in one sentence have the same score. Why can the sentence-level score represent the word score? Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.\n\n2. As per Table 3, DAN initialization and LLM-based Mutation have higher impacts on performance. For the LLM-base Mutation, this brings additional computation. Moreover, outputs from Alg.4 could be random without any pattern so it is not straightforward and detailed to see how the diverse initializations influence the performance. It would be better if the authors could provide some insights on it. \n\n3. I also have concerns about the defense evaluation in Table 3. What is the threshold used in this evaluation? This is important because there still seems to be a small gap of PPL values between the handcrafted and automatic DANs. Does that mean if the threshold is set to be a proper value, the perplexity-based method [1] still has the chance to make successful defenses? \n\n4. For the experiments of cross-model transferability in Table 2, I have concerns about the low transferability of prompts optimized on Vicuna using GCG while Table 2 of [2] shows they can achieve ASR over 30% on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using Behavior+GCG optimized on Vicuna. It would be better to see the comparison between AutoDAN-HGA with GCG on GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.  \n\n5. The proposed method still takes a long time to optimize for one sample.  \n\n\n[1] Jain, N., Schwarzschild, A., Wen, Y., Somepalli, G., Kirchenbauer, J., Chiang, P. Y., ... & Goldstein, T. (2023).
