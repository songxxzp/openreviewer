They are such that if the fast Fourier transform of an image is multiplied pixel-wise by the mask and then the inverse of the fast Fourier transform is applied, the resulting image is assigned the same class by the network as the original image.  The authors propose a technique based on the notion of intrinsic dimension to measure possibly non-linear correlation, and apply it to assess correlation between the frequency masks of images and their adversarial perturbations.  The main result is that some correlation is shown in this way for CIFAR-10 and Imagenette datasets."

The paper then follows to describe the issue of adversarial attacks and the concept of intrinsic dimension of a data set. Next, the methodology of the proposal is described in which a method of Karantzas et al. is used to obtain the aforementioned frequencies. The paper then describes a method for determining the existence of correlation between two sets of data based on the difference between the intrinsic dimension of the concatenation of the two sets with the intrinsic dimension of the concatenation of one of the sets with a random shuffling of the other set. The argument is supported by providing an example of a 2D spiral.\n\nFinally, the paper reports the results of performing the proposed method on CIFAR and ImageNet data sets. The results suggest that the intrinsic dimension of concatenated natural and adversarial frequencies is on average increased by 4 or 5 almost surely when one the natural or adversarial samples is randomized."

They follow a recent approach by Karantzas et al. in which a Fourier mask is computed for a given input image, and then compared (in the Fourier space) with a mask similarly computed for a successful attack of the image. The authors seek to test their assertion that the network spectral bias determines the nature of successful attacks. Following Karantzas et al., the modulatory masks are computed by applying a Fast Fourier Transform, and then masking with a matrix of traininable parameters between 0 and 1. The result is converted back into an image by taking the real part of the inverse FFT, and then fed to the pretrained classifier to obtain a prediction that is used to train the mask parameters. \n\nThe authors assess the relationships between original images and their successfully attacked counterparts through a test based on intrinsic dimensionality on a vector formed by flattening and concatenating the two masks. They reason that correlation between the two would be revealed by a strong drop in ID, as compared with that of vector in which the coordinates derived from one of the masks. Z-scores are used to test the hypothesis that the drop in ID is significant. The authors then present empirical evidence for their claims based on this test."
