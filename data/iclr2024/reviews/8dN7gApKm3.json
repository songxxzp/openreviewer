                "value": "1. This article offers rich and comprehensive theoretical derivations, with strong formal proofs for the proposed regularization terms and UCE loss analysis, which makes the results quite convincing.\n2. The motivation behind the article is clear, and the analysis is praiseworthy.\n3. The proposed method has been tested on multiple benchmarks.\n4. The entire manuscript is well-structured and logically organized."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The experimental section of this manuscript appears to be less robust compared to the design and discussion of the methodology.\n2. The two proposed regularization terms, UR and TV, do not perform well in Table 1. I'm curious about the reasons behind this.\n3. There is a lack of comparative analysis in the experimental section. I'm interested in understanding how the results compare to the latest methods.\n4. The ablation experiments directly rely on the results from Tables 1 and 2 for analysis. Perhaps the author could benefit from incorporating more varied ablation designs."
