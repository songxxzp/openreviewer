In CNNs it is well known that it is hard to take advantage of irregular non-structured sparsity (see e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02124.pdf) and this is somewhat well understand in SNNs as well. Many hardware accelerators claim to try to take advantage of sparsity, but the cost associated with managing the sparsity reduces the overall energy benefits.  See https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03388.pdf for an example of a good paper that identifies a high-level energy model of SNNs which captures this issue by more accurately capturing the associated memory cost of managing an SNN. \n\nThe proposed approach ignores these issues and only uses SOPs as a metric of energy consumption. At the minimum, I would argue that the paper needs to appreciate that this metric is not accurate for many hardware accelerators and highlight which architectures this metric is most suited. I hypothesize, for example, SOPs is more reasonable for many core processors like Loihi (which do not focus on weight re-use) and less accurate for architectures where dataflow such as weight stationary play a key role."
