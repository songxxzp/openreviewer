Two-stage detectors have been thoroughly proved to be superior to the one-stage counterparts in many fields.

In my view, the sampling process in the second stage is based on the predicted box of the first stage, the box-encoding should not show such big influences. Any discussion?"

Although the proposed method in this paper uses a lower resolution, when both methods are employed at the maximum resolution, the results indicate that the approach in this paper still falls short compared to BEVFormerV2 on the nuscenes test dataset, which achieves 0.58 mAP and 0.648 NDS"
