For GMM and LMM, NIR and RGB are concatenated along channel dimensions to input the same subsequent modules, and then split to obtain the two estimated NIR weights and RGB weights to apply to the corresponding branches, respectively. It seems to me that two estimated weights are the same, how to achieve selective fusion? Or are manually setting parameters involved? It would be better to provide some justification or motivation for the design choices.\n2. Table 7 is not mentioned in the paper."
