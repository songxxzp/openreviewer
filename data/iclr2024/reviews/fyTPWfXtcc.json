Through application of admissible functions they build some mathematical tools to show invexity or quasi-invexity of some functions mentioned in the paper. These are the functions which are later used as the loss function or the regularizer in equation (1). Multiple applications of their analysis are studied such as compressive image restoration, total variation filtering, and E-ADMM. Experimental results are provided to support their claims."

E.g. in conclusion you mention that your results are very promising, but you do not specify in what sense.\n\n(b) I think Table 3 does not need the second best results highlighted. \n\n(c)There are some\"hard to read\" sentence in the text. One example in the introduction is:\n\n\"The lack of approaches for guaranteeing the global minima in non-convex settings leaves any optimization-based algorithmic solution incomplete, non-unique, and hence cannot be categorically accepted as the best possible solution despite their improved performance over convex functions.\"\n\n(d) The E-ADMM sounds like a new algorithm is proposed. Instead, you showed the convergence of the same ADMM under the assumption of invexity/quasi-invexity. The name \"E-ADMM\" causes confusion.\n\n(e) (11) is referred to as equation. It is an optimization problem.\n\n5- Background on applications in experiments 1,2,3 is not suggested. This is the case at the beginning of every section. Maybe having a separate related work section could help with organizing the paper. \n\n6- I appreciate the vast context of the paper (signal restoation in a general sense). I think in such cases when the topic entails many applications, you can limit your attention to the main pioneer works in the field. This helps the reader to follow references easier. When one faces 5,6 references on similar topic it might be discouraging or hard to choose references efficiently. I believe it is the writer\u2019s task to present the most efficient references related to their work."

While these invexity-type functions are guaranteed to be globally minimal at any stationary point, a more challenging problem is how to find these points in a computationally efficient way. This challenge, however, is largely left unaddressed in the present study. The authors did mention an ADMM-style algorithm at the end of Section 4, but it is not quite clear how this algorithm could be exactly used for solving the considered problem formulation in Equation (1). \n\n- The statements and proof arguments for some of the results in Section 4 are unclear in many places. For example, the statement of Theorem 7 reads a bit confusing, mainly due to that: 1) the comments on extensions are included at the end of the statement, and 2) the quantities $\\beta_k^g(x)$ and $v_f(x)$, which are functions of $x$, are claimed as universal constants. Moreover, according the last but one line of the proof of Theorem 7, the quantity $v_f(x)$ should also be dependent on the noise vector $\\eta$. In regard with Theorem 8, the first claim that $h$ is convex seems only valid for a proper range of $\\lambda$, which needs to be explicitly clarified in the theorem."

In Section 4.1, what is the exact invex problem formulation designed for compressive image restoration? Why the quantities $\\beta_k^g(x)$ and $v_f(x)$ in Theorem 7 can be regarded as constants while they are obviously functions of $x$? Also can you say a bit more on the scales of these quantities in the considered problem setting?"

This paper not only identifies the invexity of existing non-convex functions (for signal restoration) but also comes up with new invexity functions, based on a new definition of admissible function, yielding a global optimality guarantee. This paper then shows that the standard ADMM also works for constrained \"invex\" problems.
