The superiority of the model is not sufficiently reflected.\n(2) You did not discuss the threshold \u03c4 in the subsequent experiments. It is not clear how you optimized the threshold. It feels like you are showing the best experimental results that you got separately with \u03c4=0.1 or \u03c4=0.2.\n(3) The last two models, after adding SPAug-Learnable, indeed improved on the corrupted dataset, but there was a loss on the clean dataset. I hope you can consider the adaptability issue between the specific data augmentation strategy and the data.\n(4) Introducing an adaptive learning data augmentation strategy increases the complexity of the model and may lead to extended training times and computational costs. While you mentioned that this method introduces minimal overhead, there is no specific experimental data in the article to support this claim."

Similarly, Hou et al. [2] adopted the idea of curriculum learning and applied it to decide when to augment data during training. But this is also not discussed by the authors. Other augmentation techniques being sota, PRIME [4] and TrivialAugment [5], are not compared with.\n\n__clarity__\nExplanation of equation (4) is not clear and in Fig. 3, the formula for hard sample should be: L_i - \\sigma(m_i)\nIt is unclear in the formula whether the cross-entropy loss should be calculated on the original images or the augmented images. If the cross-entropy loss is computed based on the augmented images, then the parameter m_i could be also updated through backpropagation, just like AugMax [1].\n\n__Non-comprehensive experimental results__\nThe authors only show results of SPAug combined with AugMix on ImageNet, while the results of it combined with AutoAugment and RandomAugment are not provided. The standard performance of models are not given in Table 2. The evaluation metrics in [3] used for benchmarking the robustness of models to image corruptions are not used. \nExperiments are mostly focused to small datasets, while ImageNet is only used for a single comparison. The claims and observations made on CIFAR10/100 are thus limited and cannot be generalized and compared with those in other papers that extensively experiments on ImageNet. Furthermore, only a single architecture is tested: how would this method perform with transformer training strategies?\n\n__Figures do not have enough explanations__\nThe meaning of x and y axes in Fig, 4 are not explained and  the figure itself is not easily readable. From the figure, I cannot interpret how the binary mapping function governs the extent of augmentations. In Fig. 5, the authors provide four augmented versions for one class, alongside the changes of m_i during training. However, the relationship between the augmented images and the m_i tendency is not explained. \n\n__Missing appendices__\nThe authors mention appendix and supplementary materials, but it is not given. \n\n[1] Wang et al., \u201cAugMax: Adversarial Composition of Random Augmentations for Robust Training\u201d, (2021)\n[2] Hou et al., \u201cWhen to Learn What: Model-Adaptive Data Augmentation Curriculum\u201d, (2023)\n[3] Hendrycks et al., \u201cBenchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations\u201d, (2019)\n[4] Modas et al., PRIME: A few primitives can boost robustness to common corruptions, (2022)\n[5] Muller et al.

Is there any trade-off between them, considering needed computational resources?\n- In Tables 4 and 5, the results of models trained in the 100 and 200 epochs are given. However, the gained performance through more training epochs is not significant. For instance, in Table 4, the gained C-Err for SPAug-Learnable is on average 0.5, while this value for AA is 0.9. What is the reason for training more epochs to obtain trivial improvement using SPAug-Learnable? Besides, why is the baseline model WRN-28-10 having different C-Err in Table 2 and 4?\n- How does the method perform on ImageNet with other existing augmentation techniques, and with other architectures (e.g. Transformers)?"
