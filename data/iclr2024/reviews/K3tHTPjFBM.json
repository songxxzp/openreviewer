At the first place, authors contribute a multi-task benchmark dataset PROMPT that incorporates protein-ligand affinity prediction, protein-protein affinity prediction and protein function prediction. For addressing the multi-task learning under such a set, authors employ a multi-relational equivariant encoder for extracting protein representations and use task-specific heads for prediction. Based the experimental results, the proposed architecture outperforms previous architectures (like GVP and GearNet) on single-task learning, and some benefits are observed on ligand-protein and protein-protein affinity prediction by applying multi-task learning."

However, in terms of experimental comparison and multi-task learning, I have concerns as below:\n\n1. In current multi-task learning experiments, we can observe obvious performance decay on function prediction tasks after coupling with affinity prediction, which is counter-intuitive. There should be some deep analysis on this phenomenon.\n\n2. Although performance gains are observed on affinity prediction after coupling with function prediction tasks, it is still not clear which specific task (EC, MF, BP or CC) leads to such increase. Authors are suggested to supplement more fine-grained task-coupling results, i.e., LBA&PPI + EC, LBA&PPI + MF, LBA&PPI + BP and LBA&PPI + CC. These results can help us better identify good task combinations. \n\n3. There are some state-of-the-art protein encoders ignored for performance comparison, like CDConv [a] and Full-atom GearNet [b].\n\n4. A more thorough discussion on the technique contributions against GearNet and dyMEAN is suggested. \n\n\n[a] Fan, Hehe, et al. \"Continuous-Discrete Convolution for Geometry-Sequence Modeling in Proteins.\" ICLR, 2022.\n\n[b] Zhang, Zuobai, et al. \"Physics-Inspired Protein Encoder Pre-Training via Siamese Sequence-Structure Diffusion Trajectory Prediction.\" NeurIPS, 2023."

A task-aware readout mechanism is designed to associate the output head of each task with a learnable task prompt.

Further, some empirical evidence would also be helpful.\n- There are previous studies demonstrating similar performance gains for proteins from multi-task sequence models, such as [1][2][3]. I acknowledge that it is non-trivial to extend the success in using sequential information to structural information and build structural benchmarks. Yet the novelty and contribution of building such a benchmark alone, when the proposed HeMeNet is not adequately novel, is not as expected to be published in the main conference of ICLR. \n- The HeMeNet network is similar to existing GNN-based protein structure models, like dyMEAN. Also, for task-aware readouts, there are a few recent works inspired by prompt learning and prefix tuning such as [4].\n- The experiments do not cover comparisons with prompting LLMs and multi-task protein sequence models.
