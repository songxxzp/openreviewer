At times the paper feels like it is directed towards general manifolds (as the title implies) but then Assumption 1 restricts to the case where M is a smooth compact submanifold of a sphere. This leads me to my reservation with the use of Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 has a general setting to it with retractions and projections, however for spheres these maps are well defined in closed form (the log in exponential maps) which could perform better than the general mappings. The first line of the paper says they propose OR^2-l0 but their contribution is in terms of the l1 norm. It feels like this was a much longer paper or two papers that split at the seams.\n\nThere is a good amount of literature on manifold regression such as that of Fletcher et al. which I cannot seem to consolidate with the current work. For instance, on sphere it is well known that having antipodal sets of points causes issues even with mean estimation so I wish some sort of discussion to that effect were included.\n\nWhen presenting the results I'm curious why only the median result is presented. Error bars would be beneficial.\n\nThere is too large an emphasis on theoretical results and very little demonstration of the theory."

For this purpose, it utilizes a known l1 optimization problem, but formulates it over a submanifold of the sphere, instead of previous works that studied it either on the sphere or the Grassmannian manifold. \n\n\nThe paper is clearly written and seems to be correct, however, it suffers from the following weaknesses:\n\n\n1. The general motivating framework of the paper is the problem of robust subspace recovery and it had many relevant developments. In particular, the following works are not mentioned at all\nLerman, G., McCoy, M. B., Tropp, J. A., & Zhang, T. (2015). Robust computation of linear models by convex relaxation.

Journal of Machine Learning Research, 20(37)\nLerman G. &  Maunu T. (2018), \"An Overview of Robust Subspace Recovery,\" in Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 106, no. 8, pp. 1380-1410, Aug. 2018, doi: 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2853141\nThere is a lot of discussion of DPCP, however, this is just a framework of using the orthogonal component, instead of searching the subspace itself. In fact the main two practical methods of DPCP (gradient descent and IRLS) directly follow previous works of robust subspace recovery (gradient descent follows reference 5 above and IRLS follows reference 4 above), but instead of applying them to find a subspace, they find the orthogonal complement of this subspace and easily adapt the original methods. Here the orthogonal complement has dimension one, so the optimization is restricted to the sphere. \n2. Many of the technical details follow previous works. Even though there is a new component of analyzing submanifolds of the sphere, the ideas are very similar to previous methods.  The authors mention some previous works of DPCP, but there are earlier works. For the non-convex, non-smooth setting, the well-tempered landscape and the geometric quantities for the geometry of the inliers and outliers and their interplay (permeance, alignment and stability) are discussed in reference 5 above (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03896). A comparative discussion of the new ideas of the proposed work with respect to the developments of the latter work would be beneficial. Let me also mention that earlier ideas for these geometric quantities for a convex relaxation of this problem appeared in reference 1 above.  \n3. It is unclear exactly how many outliers in a realistic setting can be tolerated by the method. The thresholds presented in the theorem have no interpretation for any model of data, whether probabilistic or arbitrary. \n4. The presentation mentions general manifolds, but it seems to me that the only possible application of this setting is to the manifold of essential matrices.\n5. The experiments are rather weak in my opinion. I find it important to work on real computer vision datasets in order to witness the improvement gained by this method, while comparing to state of the art (SOTA) methods of robust estimation of essential matrices (as well as fundamental matrices, since the calibration is known in these datasets). Even the artificial experiments are unsatisfactory to me, since it is not clear how the outliers are generated and whether this generation corresponds to real scenarios, and there are no comparisons with other SOTA methods for robustly estimating the essential matrix.\n6. I expect possibly stronger numerical results when working with fundamental matrices instead of essential matrices, since the corresponding set is higher-dimensional and in this sense it is easier to work with; however, I can see some other difficulties working with fundamental matrices using the proposed framework. It will be good to discuss this issue."

However, this can be considered as synthetic data only, and will be nice to see how the proposed algorithm perform on real data such as 3D point cloud road data (e.g., Zhihui Zhu, et al, [2]).\n\nGiven the theoretical analysis for both OR2-RSGM and OR2-IRLS are presented in section 4 and Appendix, it seems no discussion or high-level summary about computational cost is given in this work.\n\nThe algorithm contribution of OR2-IRLS seems largely based on previous work (e.g., [1-4]) and sort of relative limited.\n\nMaybe I missed, not sure if experimental results in section 5 or Appendix, included any empirical comparison between 2 proposed algorithms in this work?"

[1] in the paper.\n\nQuestion 2: in case if not included yet, should be good to see the empirical results comparison between OR2-RSGM and OR2-IRLS.\n\nQuestion 3: seems there are dual listed reference for Tsakiris & Vidal 2018?"
