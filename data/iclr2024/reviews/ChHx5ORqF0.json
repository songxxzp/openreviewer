The paper introduces a very general alignment setting in Introduction + Figure 1, which is not matched with what is really performed. I had to make several loops between Method & Introduction + Figure 1 to understand what is going on.\n\n1.2. \"1) We consider scenarios where the class label spaces are matched but the annotation protocols are different, therefore, leading to annotation mismatches (see Section 3). 2) We optimize the target performances, while multi-dataset detection optimizes the average performances of all datasets considered.\" => The authors should provide convincing arguments + results on why this narrowed-down scope of the mismatch problem is significant.\n\n1.3. \"In this work, we assume that (1) the class labels are the same between the source and the target labeling functions and (2) the source labeling function either detects or over-detects all the objects specified in the target labeling function.\" => Again, the validity of these assumptions should be justified.\n\n1.4. \"We optimize the target performances, while multi-dataset detection optimizes the average performances of all datasets considered.\" => Why is it not better to have a multi-dataset version?\n\n1.5. \"label translation\" is misleading. With the general coverage in the Introduction, I expected language translation to be performed in the method. \"Recall from our main assumption that label translation does not require generating a correct class label, but only determining whether the object should be labeled as well as the corresponding bounding box.\" => I have difficulty calling this translation.\n\n1.6. Section 3: It would be worthwile to extend this section with analyses. As such, it is rather weak.\n\n2. Experimental evaluation is limited. It is not clear why YOLOv3 is chosen, compared to its newer versions or other one-stage detectors?\n\n3. Most importantly, as bbox localization changes through the proposed method, the paper should quantify localization directly and evaluate performance with such a measure. I would recommend the localization term of the Localization Recall Precision metric.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n- Fig 1 left: Cyclist => rider for the MVD dataset.\n- Introduction: \"This work characterizes four types of annotation mismatches,\" => It would be nice to briefly summarize here what these four types are.\n- Figure 3: The figure gives a feeling that the 'cyclist' label belongs to both datasets, which makes it difficult to understand what is being translated into what.\n\n**After the rebuttal**\n\nThe authors have been able to partially address my concerns about the significance of the taxonomy and the experimental evaluation. For taxonomy to be considered a contribution, I expect more analyses & justifications. The experiments with a SOTA model should also be more comprehensive as YOLOv8-nano is hardly a SOTA model. However, the authors did the best of what could be done in a short amount of time and I find the extended discussion on the taxonomy and the new results promising. Therefore, I would like to increase my original recommendation."

                "value": "This paper attempts to tackle annotation mismatches in multi-dataset training for object detectors. It points out that different datasets may have different definitions or annotation protocols to the same category, leading to annotation mismatches. Four kinds of annotation mismatches are highlighted, i.e. Class semantics, Annotation instructions, Human-machine misalignment, Cross-modality labels. To address those mismatches, it proposes to train a label translator to translate annotations of source datasets to the target datasets. The label translator follows the design of two-stage detector (e.g. faster rcnn) with a RPN and RoI head. During the training of the translator, the RPN is trained with source datasets and generates source-style boxes. The RoI head converts the generated source-style boxes to the target-style. During inference, the RoI head converts ground-truth annotations of the source dataset (both boxes and class labels) to the target-style. Experiments shows that the proposed label translator improves various detectors on certain pairs of datasets."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The assumption is too strong that the source and the target datasets have the same categories. In multi-dataset training, it is a common case that different datasets not only have overlapped categories but also have unique categories. I believe it's more important to handle unique categories that are annotated in one dataset but not in the others. That's because unannotated objects in the other datasets will be regarded as background by mistake. It's better to have a solution to handle both overlapped and unique categories.\n\n2. RoI head is able to refine various region proposals to the target-style boxes. Is it necessary to train a RPN as box generator that generates source-style boxes? It's better to compare the proposed solution with a only-RPN solution. That is, train a RPN (probably together with the two-stage architecture) with the target dataset and use it on different source datasets so that we don't need to train RPNs for different pairs of source-target datasets.\n\n3. I'm not sure how to use the label translator to handle target datasets with more than one categories. Based on the experiments, it seems that the label translator only handles one category ('cyclist' in  Synscapes, Cityscapes, MVD, nuImages and Waymo). Probably, with the increase of categories, the label translator may introduce the noisy pseudo labels and negatively impact the performance.\n\n4. Evaluations on widely used object detection datasets are missing. How about COCO, Objects365, and OpenImages? It seems that the experiments only include detection datasets for driving scenarios.\n\n5. Based on Sect. 5.3, translation-mAP is not strongly correlated with downstream-mAP, and visually analyzing the translated labels is insufficient to judge label translation. Why is translation-mAP reported?\n\n6. The proposed label translation seem to require training between every source and target datasets, which is costly to scale up."
