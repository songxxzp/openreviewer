For the classification task (which the paper is mainly focusing on), the proposed method requires clients not only to train a model for classification (feature extractor and classifier) as well as a local generator. For the server, it needs to train a global generator. This introduces much more computation overhead. On-edge learning where all clients have limited resources, the propose method might not work. For data-free KD-based FL, there is a prior work that does not need to train a generative model. I think it's better to compare with it [1].\n\n2. The local objective and server's objective functions are so complicated. There are many terms using MSE, KLD and Cross-Entropy Loss. As a result, there are too many hyper-parameters for the regularization terms. However, there is no theoretical analysis on the convergence in the paper. The method is empirical but difficult to reproduce because so many hyper-parameters.\n\n3. The experiments ran on simple datasets, EMNIST, FMNIST,CIFAR-10. The proposed method need to be validated in more larger dataset such as CIFAR100/ImageNet. However, more complicated dataset might need more larger model as generators, which increases the computation overhead.\n\n4. The small problem of the paper: many notations are similar, such as $\\mathcal{L}_{mse}$ with $\\leftarrow$ and $\\rightarrow$, really confusing. And the table 4 in ablation study, those different $\\mathcal{L}$ are not straightforward.\n\nReference:\n[1] Chen H, Vikalo H.

It achieves this by partitioning a classification network into two components: a feature extractor and a head. To obviate the need of synchronizing feature extractors across different clients, a conditional feature generator is introduced. The proposed framework offers an inherent advantage in privacy protection, as classical gradient inversion attacks become ineffective due to the absence of access to the feature extractor. \n\nThe conditional generator serves two purposes: it guides the training of local heads and also influences the output of local feature extractor. To further enhance local training and global aggregation, the authors incorporate various knowledge distillation technologies."

The proposed method incorporates a complex setup including 13 losses functions and 6 hyperparameters,  which appears overly complicated. However, the authors conduct an ablation study that justifies the inclusion of each individual loss. Additionally, they demonstrate that the method is relatively insensitive to the values of these hyperparameters."

For example, rather than training an additional feature generator, the clients can share their features and corresponding labels directly. In terms of privacy leakage, this alternative is equivalent to the proposed method, since the feature generator itself is trained on local features. Furthermore, direct feature sharing can largely reduce the framework's complexity. \n\n2. Since the feature extractor is solely trained on the local device using the local data. The diversity of local data becomes critical for the training of feature extractor. Due to the same reason, I question the method's scalability to larger networks. As it stands, the paper only presents results based on the LeNet architecture. \n\n3. The experimental results reveals that the proposed method underperforms compared to baseline approaches in the majority of evaluated settings.\n\n4.

                "value": "1) The foremost goal of the paper is to mitigate privacy leakage through deep gradient leakage (DLG) attacks by a semi-honest server. As noted in the appendix, it is hard to come up with theoretical privacy guarantees for this framework. However, it is certainly feasible to come up with strong attacks and evaluate the proposed algorithm against such strong attacks. While some leakage results are reported in Table 2 and Figure 4, the paper fails to specify the exact attack mechanism deployed. In the proposed framework, the only unknown (compared to the FedAvg setting) for a malicious server are the parameters of the local feature extractors in each round. It should be possible to come up with sophisticated DLG attacks following the same knowledge distillation strategies employed for client training. For instance, can a reverse distillation process be used by the server to transfer knowledge from the local generators to estimate the local feature extractors and then use these local feature extractors to reconstruct the input samples? Can the above attack benefit from the availability of an auxiliary dataset at the server?\n\n2) The evaluation metrics (local and global accuracy) used in this work appear to be unrealistic. The local partition of the test is stochastic and not reproducible. Given that no statistics has been reported, it is hard to judge the variations in performance. On the other hand, the global accuracy also does not make sense because that requires constructing a \"virtual\" model using one round of FedAvg, which is against the main principle of the proposed method. Maybe the local accuracy at each client could be computed based on all the test data and average of these local accuracy values should be reported along with standard deviation.\n\n3) The model used for the experiments is LeNet-5, which is not a reasonable model for most real-world applications. Furthermore, this model has been arbitrarily divided into feature extractor and classifier. The main argument of this work is that the latent feature space has so-called \"high-level patterns\" and it is difficult to construct the input data from these patterns. How accurate is this assumption when the feature extractor is simply a couple of conv layers? Moreover, the datasets used in this experiment are also not representative (very low resolutions images with utmost 10 classes). How will the proposed approach scale for larger resolution images (e.g., 224 x 224) with deeper neural networks (e.g., ResNet-18) and more classes (e.g., ImageNet)?"
