Following a line of recent works, this paper formulates T2I alignment evaluation as visual question answering (VQA), which involves question generation from the text prompt using LLMs and question answering using VQA models (referred to as the QG/A framework).\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n* It identifies the issues of existing QG/A methods regarding the question generation step and proposes four properties that the generated questions should satisfy.\n* It proposes a QG method that constructs the questions of a given text prompt as a Davidsonian Scene Graph (DSG). DSG considers the dependency between questions and is designed to satisfy the four properties.\n* It collects a test set of 1060 prompts, which covers different challenges, semantic categories and writing styles, together with Likert-scale T2I alignment rating by humans.\n* The experiments demonstrate that DSG, when combined with different VQA models, achieves a higher correlation with human evaluation compared with existing QG/A frameworks.\n* It further reveals two challenges of QG/A frameworks for T2I evaluation: (1) Some question categories (e.g., shape, style and text rendering) are beyond the capability of current SOTA VQA models to evaluate. (2) For questions that involve \u201csubjectivity\u201d and \u201cdomain knowledge\u201d, agreement is hard to achieve even between humans."

According to Table 9, six categories have less than 30 examples and VQA-Human correlation is not computed for these categories.\n\n### Evaluation\n* There is no ablation study showing which design choice in DSG contributes to each of the four properties.\n* It is unclear whether DSG correlates better with humans, compared with TIFA and VQ^A, in each fine-grained category.\n* The relationship between the claimed desired question properties and the final VQA-Human correlation is not well demonstrated. In other words, the relationship between Precision/Recall/Atomicity/Uniqueness in Table 2 and Spearman/Kendall correlation in Table 3 is unclear.\n* There is no comparison with TIFA and VQ^2A in terms of precision and recall in Table 2."
