The authors treat LLMs as a principal component analysis model, use them to fit the data distribution and find the top-k most important features with different prompts as the explanations for black-box models. This is not a guaranteed process because it is unclear how LLMs fit the data distribution inside the prompt, not to mention how LLMs \"understand\" the data distribution and further provide a faithful explanation from the perspective of data. In fact, the \"logical thinking skill\"[1], the ability to process math problems[1], and the instruction-following ability of LLMs[2] are poor or remain unclear; even the order of the input will affect the output of a LLM[3].\n\nTo maximize the power of LLM, a better way is to post-hoc explain the model's output from the perspective of \"natural language\", like [4], which is easy to understand and easy to evaluate. Using language as output, the faithfulness of explanation can be easily evaluated by human annotators intuitively. Another way is to let LLMs use tools (e.g., use Python to code) to enhance the extra ability of LLMs and further obtain a guaranteed faithful explanation for a black-box model.\n\n[1] Song et al.

If the LLMs can perform better than or for cheaper than the existing algorithms, these approaches could be effective in practice."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. (Pareto Curve) Even if the LLMs are decisively better/worse than the existing explainability methods, the ultimate decision of the practitioner would also be based on how cheap/expensive it is to obtain the explanations. I would be interested to see an approximate cost-benefit tradeoff to have a better sense of whether the LLM-in-the-loop explainers are preferable in practice. The cost here could be with respect to $ compute and with respect to time. \n\n2. Authors focus on relatively simple tabular datasets, which I personally think limits the impact of the methodology and results. While I understand that it\u2019s not yet possible to focus on many different domains (e.g. vision seems not possible yet); I believe it would have been possible to use existing text classifiers, as perturbations could still be communicated to existing models via prompts. This would increase the practicality and the value of the evaluation, in my view.\n\n3. (Lack of sufficient experimental details) I find that the presentation of the experiments could be significantly improved. As it stands, there are a lot of missing details in the experiments section or the Appendix, which makes me feel less confident about the reliability of the results. I detail several points below. I believe most of these points could easily be addressed in the rebuttal phase, and I will be happy to revise my assessment during the rebuttal.\n\n- 3.1 Importantly, I believe the authors should define their evaluation metrics; e.g., for metrics like PGI, PGU, RA, FA the authors refer to earlier papers without explicitly defining what they are. The reader should ideally be able to see the metrics without navigating to different papers.\n\n- 3.2 I cannot find the hyperparameters of the explainers or the rationale for picking them. In particular, it\u2019s unclear if the performance may or may not be explained by a poor choice of hyperparameters, as even the rationale of the hyperparameter choices for existing algorithms (LIME, SHAP etc.) are not presented in the paper. Since most of the results are meaningful in a relative sense (compared to the baselines), this is an important point to clarify.\n\n- 3.3 Similarly, for reproducibility purposes, the details around the models used should be better provided. E.g. it\u2019s unclear what optimizer is used to train the models, with which learning rate, whether early stopping is applied, and so on. This would surely raise reproducibility issues for follow-up work unless addressed.\n\n- 3.4 The authors describe the process of parsing the response as `We first save each LLM query\u2019s reply to a text file and use a script to extract the features.` I believe further details are needed to better understand this process. Specifically, what is the existing parsing strategy? Are the responses always parseable? What fraction of the time they are not parseable? \n\n- 3.5 The authors present ` LLMs accurately identify the most important feature` as a significant result (e.g. abstract `identify the most important feature with 72.19% accuracy,`), however for this specific task I do not see baselines. Why do the authors have baselines for faithfulness, but not for this specific task (apologies if I\u2019m missing this and the result exists)? Specifically \u2013 how good are existing algorithms at identifying the most important feature?\n\n- 3.6 There are claims I find unjustified. For instance, `The second approach significantly aids the LLM in discerning the most important features` \u2013 how can we claim this without any results in Page 6 under implementation details? If there is an experimental finding that supports this, please refer to the result. \n\n4. I\u2019m slightly confused about the insights we can draw from the experiments. Specifically, the authors propose 3 different explanation strategies that seem to perform reasonably similarly. I understand the overall message that LLMs have the potential to be used as explainers. However, the confusing part to me is there are 3 algorithms presented, and it\u2019s hard to understand which one is better or when. I\u2019d appreciate it if the authors could provide a concise discussion around this."

It oversimplifies the task of interpretability, arbitrarily modeling logistic regression coefficients as fixed ground truths and using prediction gap -- but there are a million dramatically cheaper ways that they could have selected the most important features according to the same criteria.\n\nAlso, a notable limitation (if the more fundamental questions did not overshadow it) is that the models interpreted are all quite simple, the datasets are themselves simple, and more standard models for tabular data are not considered (but again, this is not the paper's primary limitation). Lastly, it seems presumptive to suggest that this approach is better than SHAP, at least without a deeper investigation into where this method outperforms it (and some discussion on why it ostensibly performs almost as poorly as randomly selecting features). These points are less important to me, but they are still worth raising."
