The framework called hierarchically branched diffusion models, leverages the hierarchical relationship between different classes in the dataset to learn the diffusion process in a branched manner. The framework has several advantages over existing methods, such as being easily extendable to new classes, enabling analogy-based conditional generation (i.e. transmutation), and offering interpretability into the generation process. The paper evaluates the framework on several benchmark and large real-world scientific datasets, spanning different data modalities (images, tabular data, and graphs)."

Whenever some classes are ruled, out this is denoted as a \u2018branch point\u2019. In the method, these points are empirically estimated from the noising forward process and the original training data, and during training and generation, a separate conditioning signal is given to each of the branches. Each class has a unique combination of branches. It is shown that this formulation of class-conditional generation helps in avoiding catastrophic forgetting in some scenarios, lends itself to novel image-translation-type conditional generation for MNIST, gene data and molecules. Additionally, the paper shows a method to visualize and interpret the branching points using averages of the noisy data points. There can also be a benefit in generation efficiency if sampling multiple classes by combining the generation of multiple classes at once."

For the analogy-based generation with the RNA-seq data set, some marker genes were indeed changed, but do we have any other way to evalute the success of these generations? Could we formalize a clear objective on what does the conditional generation aim to do in the first place here? A similar issue exists for the molecule data set: Indeed regenerating does allow to generate cycled molecules from acyclic ones, but it is not clear what if any properties of the original molecule are retained this way. Just looking at the results, it seems possible that the generated molecules are a random mixture of the desired property and some atoms and bonds from the original molecules. \n- Continuing on the analogy-based generation, I feel that it would be appropriate to do an ablation where we use a regular diffusion model, noise out the data partially, and regenerate with the changed label. Would this work equally well, or differently somehow?\n- The points about interpretability are also interesting, but it remains a bit unclear what could be the use of these average branching points."

                "value": "- What does the high correlation of expression between genes before and after transmutation mean here? That those particular genes often did not change? Is this the property that we want?\n- Since adding uncorrelated noise probably does not result in clean hierarchical class structures in all cases (maybe in more complex image data sets, as pointed out in the paper), do you think it would be possible to induce such structure, e.g., by diffusing in some specifically designed latent spaces or otherwise designing the diffusion process itself to encourage it?\n- I wonder if the example where catastrophic forgetting is avoided in MNIST is possible to extend to multiple steps, to a slightly more realistic continual learning scenario?\n\nOverall, I think the idea is interesting and the paper presents new qualitative effects that emerge from the new formulation, but it is not there yet for publication. In particular, a more thorough experimental validation for continual learning and analogy-based generation would be in place, so that the reader would have clear takeaways. For the analogy-based generation, some kind of formalization of what are we targeting with the conditional generation, would also help with showcasing the potential significance."

The branching point definition involves a threshold. There does not appear to be a concrete recipe for the selection of this threshold. Based on the paper it seems to be left to the practitioner to determine when branching points are \u201ctoo close\u201d to 0 or T.

The claims should be moderated or experimental results provided to support the more general conclusions. \n\nThe paper proposes a novel, intriguing and elegant approach. The major weakness of the paper is that most of the claims in the paper are supported by relatively limited experimentation. For example, the paper claims that the method achieves similar or better generative performance as the state-of-the-art, but does not clearly preface this with the clarification that the outperformance is observed only for two simple character-based image datasets and the similar performance is only established for one other dataset.

Do the authors consider that there would be value in employing other approaches for investigating sample quality?   \n\nQ3. Why is the new class experiment limited to training on 3 classes? Is this to make the task easier? The new class experiment for the single-cell RNA-seq dataset seems to be similarly limited (just starting with two classes and adding a third).
