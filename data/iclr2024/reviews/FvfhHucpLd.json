I suspect the persona does not add much to the method. This requires an ablation.\n- The labels on each of the Figures could be clearer. The color codes are missing.\n\n\nIn conclusion, while the proposed method by the authors is clear, it appears the novelty of this work is severely limited (see above).

Instead of relying on the decoding algorithm (sampling) to generate diverse solutions, this approach creates prompts using different approaches from a pool of approaches suitable for a task. When prompted with these different approaches the LLM is shown to generate diverse solutions. Aggregating the results from these diverse prompts has been shown to be more effective than the self-consistency baseline. \n\nThe method can be summarised as follows:\n1. Create Persona, Approach combinations for a given task: Given a dataset - pick a random question q; ask LLM to come up with Personas & Approaches using LLM output (aggregating m x n suggestions from LLMs based in instruction|question|template ) & then picking pick top 5 using word cloud. Similarly let the LLM generate suggestions for apt personas for a given task.\n2. Pick an optimal P,A: For all P,A combinations the composite prompt is tried on a held-out set. And those with the highest performance are selected.\n3. Create Augmented demonstrations: Once the approaches for a task are selected as per above, we ask the LLM to modify existing demonstrations with the given set of approaches. \n4. Inference: Run with multiple prompts, each with a different augmented demonstration. Then output of these is aggregated. This can be done in a single call to the LLM (IDIV-SE) instead of independent inference steps (DIV-SE)."

This makes the proposed DIV-SE method somewhat limited in practical applications. CoT prompting on the other hand provide universally applicable prompts, and self-consistency provides a generally applicable framework without needing a held-out set to fine-tune on.\n\n- Results seem mixed: Blocksworld clearly benefits from the diversity in prompting. It is clear on this benchmark that with IDIV-SE more can be achieved in less cost. But on other benchmarks this is not necessarily true e.g. GSM8K (Fig 3 & Fig 4).\n\n- No qualitaitve/quantitative assessment of the synthetically generated demonstrations (using LLMs). For augmented demonstrations - how is the quality of this dataset ensured? I suspect some human annotation to improve the quality of these demonstrations can improve eventual model performance.\n\n- Limited evaluation: Some commonly used reasoning benchmarks are not present, making it hard to compare with prior work like Wang et al's Self Consistency baseline. Arithmetic reasoning: AddSub MultiArith ASDiv SVAMP. Commonsense and symbolic reasoning:  CSQA StrategyQA ARC-e ARC-c Letter Coinflip\n\n- Fig 4 & 5 - For a fair comparison with DIVSE-1 to 5, shouldn't Self Consistency baseline also be given multiple reasoning paths instead of just report SC-1?\n\n- The study could also be extended to other models with smaller sizes e.g. Llama 2 7B variants.\n- Difference in effectiveness of DIV-SE could be reported for pre-trained vs chat finetuned/RLHF-ed models."

Are they really diverse? Are each of them valid? If yes, are they different from other prompts?\n\n- Sec 2.2 . In practice, for all (persona, approach) combinations, we evaluate the prompt formed using the composition on a held-out set and choose those with the highest performance. This seems like a limitation - for open ended reasoning tasks that could appear in conversational applications, how can this be done outside the benchmarks studied?\n\n- Fig 6 & 8 are referenced in the text but missing in the paper? Did you mean Fig 2?\n\n- Can you explain how different this approach is from self-consistency: I'm not sure if the approach can be described as one bringing diversity in prompting. The diversity is being attempted in the set of approaches taken by the LLM to solve a problem. This is still very similar in spirit to self-consistency - where instead of naively sampling n times, the model is prompted to generate different approaches. The approaches themselves are model generated."
