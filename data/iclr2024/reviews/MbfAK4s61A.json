They showed that the LLMs, esp. GPT-4, can understand most of the ciphers fairly well and have a much higher chance of generating unsafe responses through ciphers."

I think these are important information that need to be mentiond.\n2. In line with my previous comment, I felt like the selfchipher section needed more details and explanation.\n3. I also thought the technical contributions of this paper was lacking. Authors used simple in-context prompts and demonstrations to solve the problem.\n4. To get the prompts in English, authors translated the sentences from Chinese which can not be reliable. One question is how reliable this translation is considering that safety can have cultural and linguistic implications?\n5. The human evaluations were done on a small sample (50 per case).\n6. Since in most cases the success rate was small, so many rows were empty in many experimental results. This made it hard to get any robust conclusion from the results.\n7. In general, I think the experimental setup and results need to be made more robust.\n8. Since this paper discusses a sensitive topic, it would be good if authors can include an ethics statement and talk about societal impact of this research.

In the proposed framework CipherChat, a malicious unsafe text is enciphered by a LLM using the proposed system prompt, which consists of behavior assigning, cipher teaching, and enciphered unsafe demonstrations. Then the LLM generates the corresponding encrypted response. The generalizability of safety alignment of the LLM is assessed by evaluating the extent of safety of the deciphered response. The authors employed three types of ciphers: (1) Character encoding (GBK, ASCII, UTF, Unicode), (2) Common Cipher (Atbash, Morse, Ceasar), (3) SelfCipher, which is the author proposed, and that does not use any explicit rules of cipher but is just role-playing. The results show that GPT-4 is good at enciphering natural language, but also vulnerable at safety for encrypted ones."

Then, any other random words can encourage the models to work in this way? Can you share any insight attained during this work?\n- As far as I understand, the LLMs seem to be easy to follow the instructions with demonstration samples when they deal with encrypted text. As the authors showed, the unsafe rate was severely dropped both when the unsafe demonstration samples were replaced with safe ones, and when any demonstration samples were not given. I suggest, if you are possible, adding instruction-following evaluation results concerning the cipher, to see if the cipher has effects only for unsafe prompts or for general instructions."
