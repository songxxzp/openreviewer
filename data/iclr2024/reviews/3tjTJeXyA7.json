Nevertheless, most of baselines are CNN-based. Therefore, I doubt whether the algorithm would work when the baseline is set as the architecture with large receptive field.   \n(iii) Since authors provide various formats of the algorithm, and most of the formats achieve comparable results. I doubt if it is necessary to design so many formats for the usage. \n(iv) The numerical results are improved with the algorithm, but the global information is easy to be affected. I doubt whether the improved version of the baseline has weak generalization ability than the baseline networks.\n\n------------------------After Rebuttal---------------------------\n\nThank you for your feedback. I appreciate your acknowledgment of the partial alleviation of concerns. However, certain issues persist, giving the impression of overclaimed contributions in the paper. Here are specific points:\n\n(i) The discussion on spatial and channel attention lacks comprehensiveness, omitting various attention mechanisms such as Fourier-based methods (e.g., GFNet). The application of standard spatial attention alone may not be sufficiently convincing.\n\n(ii) The proposed method shows limited performance gains on baselines with a large receptive field. In the SNRformer results, only PSNR sees a slight improvement, casting doubt on the method's applicability in certain scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the novelty of the method, the rebuttal materials fall short of significantly demonstrating its compatibility with diverse frameworks and operations. Therefore, I have decided to lower the score."

As far as I know, there is another work [1] attempts to introduce frequency design into channel dimension attention. Although the design and motivation behind the two works are different,  the relevance between the two works are not illustrated.\n[1] FcaNet: Frequency Channel Attention Networks. ICCV 2021.\n2. As a core claim, \u201cThe primary objective of CFTL is to capture global discriminative\nrepresentations by modeling channel-dimension discrepancy \u201d. What would this property help improve image enhancement are not well-explained. \n3. As a core design space, the channel-dimension Fourier transform is applied in the global pooling-based space. The necessity of applying the core operation in this space are not fully discussed. What about using other spaces that possess global information properties? \n4. As the concrete implementation, the Eq.(6) introduces the attention operation without many explanations. \n5. Based on the above concerns, how to come up with the idea of the channel-dimension Fourier transform is not discussed, although its mechanism is illustrated.  \n6. Besides, more qualitative results are suggested to supplement in the appendix.\n\n================================\n1. The author's responses addressed my major concerns, however, the explanation of the \"channel-dimension discrepancy\" remains confusing. There is no explicit supporting evidence for this design. In fact, the implementations of \"channel-dimension discrepancy\" are diverse, such as feature orthogonalization [1][2], but these are not thoroughly discussed.\n\n2. The diversity in sub-sequential filter responses caused by \"channel-dimension discrepancy\" seems to be more crucial for generalization performance [3]. The references provided by the author are related to all-in-one image restoration, which is a task more closely associated with generalization, but it fails to interpret the correlation between performance improvement and filter response diversity. \n\n[1] Orthogonal Transformer: An Efficient Vision Transformer Backbone with Token Orthogonalization.
