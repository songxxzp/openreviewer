It thereby proposes SSFL, an approach to identify a subnetwork before the model training. Specifically, the parameters in the subnetwork are the largest $k$ values of saliency scores calculated by the absolute element-wise product of the weights and the gradients. The experiments validate the proposed SSFL can reduce the communication overhead as well as improve the model performance when compared to the existing works."

Although the proposed method seems efficient because the mask is found in the beginning, I don't think the proposed approach makes sense. Before the model training, the parameters $w_0$ are generated at random. Denote the gradient by $g_0$ for the initial model. Intuitively, when the model converges, the important parameters are with relatively large values, while the ignorable ones are close to 0. As the mask is merely generated in the beginning, I cannot see why Eq. (3) can find a reasonable mask. In other words, I cannot see the differences when the mask is generated arbitrarily. \n2. In addition to the mask initialization, the rest of the design is consistent with FedAvg. Following the first point, I cannot see the significance of this work. \n3. The authors mention the work based on decentralized FL. After reading the paper, I don't have an idea why it can work under peer-to-peer network architecture. Instead, it is solely workable with the client-server settings. \n4. The experiments only show the result on a sparsity level of 50\\%, which is not convincing. I would like to see the performance results when the sparsity level is at 10\\% or smaller. According to Figure 4, I notice DisPFL and Ditto are yet to converge. I wonder about their final results when they converge."

                "value": "- While the proposed method, SSFL, outperforms the selected baselines, overall the performance degrades considerably even for 50% sparsity. For standard gradient sparsification methods such as Top-k[1], Random-k[2], or rTop-k[3], there is no significant performance loss up to 90% sparsity with error feedback. I wonder if the authors have any explanation as to why SSFL and the selected baselines degrade the accuracy even with small sparsity ratios like 50%. Is this because only a fixed sparse portion of the model is trained while the rest is kept at zero? If so, would it be possible to let each client find their own mask rather than aggregating them to have one global mask for all the clients. This way, different portions of the model could be trained by different clients at the cost of losing the communication gain from server to client communication -- which is typically not the main bottleneck compared to client to server communication especially given that the current approach results in considerable accuracy loss. \n\n- I also think comparing SSFL to these alternative sparse methods (Top-k[1], Random-k[2], or rTop-k[3]) would provide a more complete picture to the readers. Also, other methods for finding optimal global sparsity masks should be added as baselines as well such as FedPM [4]. \n\n[1] Lin, Yujun, et al. \"Deep Gradient Compression: Reducing the Communication Bandwidth for Distributed Training.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2018.\n\n[2] Kone\u010dn\u00fd, Jakub, et al. \"Federated learning: Strategies for improving communication efficiency.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.05492 (2016).\n\n[3] Barnes, Leighton Pate, et al. \"rTop-k: A statistical estimation approach to distributed SGD.\" IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Information Theory 1.3 (2020): 897-907.\n\n[4] Isik, Berivan, et al. \"Sparse Random Networks for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning.\" The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations. 2022."
