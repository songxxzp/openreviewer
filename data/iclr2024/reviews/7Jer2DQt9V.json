From my perspective, it appears that graph pretraining was originally introduced to address OOD problems. Also in Section 2, the authors include the self-supervised learning into Graph OOD, however some self-supervised learning methods like GraphCL is typically considered as a graph pre-training method.\n\n2. The OOD datasets and pre-trained models used in the article are primarily focused on the molecular domain. Does this imply that the scope defined in the article is mainly centered in molecular graphs? There exist many graph pre-trained models [1-3] beyond just molecules, it would be beneficial for the article to include additional datasets and methods beyond just molecules. It is currently unclear are the findings stated in the paper still hold in these pre-trained models.\n\n3. The findings presented in the article regarding the ability of pre-trained models to address OOD issues seem to be intuitive and insufficient, because pre-trained models are originally designed to address OOD. I recommend the authors to explore more interesting findings, such as identifying which pre-training tasks can aid in specific OOD scenarios. Can any findings help us better guide the design of pre-training models or tasks?\n\n\n[1] You, Yuning, et al. \"Graph contrastive learning with augmentations.\" NeurIPS 2020.\n\n[2] Hou, Zhenyu, et al. \"Graphmae: Self-supervised masked graph autoencoders.\" KDD 2022.\n\n[3] Qiu, Jiezhong, et al. \"Gcc: Graph contrastive coding for graph neural network pre-training.\" SIGKDD 2020."

As per my understanding, the purpose of a benchmark should be to provide a fair and extensive comparison of the performance of different methods on the same task within the same environment. Since this paper claims to be a benchmark for Pretraining methods in OOD tasks, it should cover a more representative set of pretraining methods. The selection of only three methods in the paper seems limited and unrepresentative (for example, the omission of popular contrastive methods and masked autoencoders).\n- The author's claims about the superiority of pretraining methods in Graph OOD tasks appear to be overstated. The author suggests that basic pretraining methods can achieve comparable performance to specially designed methods. However, according to Table 2, there is still a significant performance gap between pretraining methods and specially designed methods on many datasets.\n- It's not surprising that pretraining on a large molecular dataset can enhance a model's performance in OOD scenarios due to the semantic similarities within molecular datasets, similar to the way large language models operate. However, as seen in Table 2, pretraining on molecular graphs does not seem to generalize well to the CMNIST dataset. This highlights the limitations of pretraining methods\n- The analysis of factors influencing the performance of Pretraining methods in Section 4.3 appears somewhat shallow. For instance, the learning rate does not seem to be a factor worthy of analysis because it is not a critical component of the model. On the other hand, the author claims that pretrained models have a sample-efficient advantage. I initially thought this meant pretrained models can maintain good performance with smaller training sets. However, Figure 2b only demonstrates that pretrained models outperform baseline methods at different label rates."
