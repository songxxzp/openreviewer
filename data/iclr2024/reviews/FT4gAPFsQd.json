In detail, the authors attempt to find the lower and upper bound of the limit sparsity and use both theoretical and experimental results to illustrate that the lower and upper bound are close. In addition, the influence of the loss function and the magnitude of weights are discussed based on the principle proposed by the authors. Many phenomena accompanied with existing pruning such as magnitude pruning is better than random pruning and iterative pruning is better than one shot pruning are also explained with the proposed principle."

Firstly the authors alter the original theorem from[1] to show that the dimension of the loss sub level set and the sparse level should fill the whole space to ensure a pruning without sacrificing the performance. It is in accordance with intuition. Then the estimation of the sub level set is transformed into the form of quadratic form of the hessian matrix which is then approximated by the term including the eigen value. In this way the authors transform the original problem into the study of eigen value of the hessian matrix. It makes the problem much clear. \nThe limit derived by induction is also verified by extensive experiments.  \nIn addition, the authors also use several concept plots to illustrate their key idea."

From my point of view, you use the magnitude pruning and the magnitude is determined by l1 norm. In addition you prune the network globally. However, for pruning using magnitude, using l1 or l2 norm will not alter the rank of these weights which means the remaining weights after pruning is the same. Then why your GOP can improve significantly against LTH. In addition, could the authors further validate the theory on large scale dataset such ImageNet or Place365?\n\nFor LTH, the key point is to keep the same initialization when doing  training. Could the theory provide an explanation for this phenomenon?\n\nFor the upper bound and lower bound part, the lower bound means the pruning limit of the network. However, I am confused by the upper bound here. It seems that the authors mean to illustrate firstly the limit we can not find a sparser one without sacrificing the performance, then for some sparsity we can find one sparse network satisfy the requirement. I am not sure whether call it upper bound is suitable. \n\nFor the part of Approximate Kinematics Formula from [1], a concrete introduction could be given in the paper for better understanding, for this part is the key component of this paper.\n\n\n[1] Dennis Amelunxen, Martin Lotz, Michael B.

                "value": "1. In Eq.3, the proposed method uses task loss + $L_1$ regularization as the pruning objective. In Eq.13 of section 3.3, the authors considered a well-trained deep neural network with weights $w^*$. The setting in Eq.13 seems not related to the pruning objective considered in Eq.3. If this is the case, then the theoretical justification of the pruning rates is only for a deep neural network trained normally instead of trained under the pruning objective given in Eq.3.\n2. Following the first point, the pruning objective provided in Eq.3 introduces a hyperparameter $\\lambda$, which controls the regularization strength, and thus the sparsity of the model. A very straightforward way to determine the pruning rate under this setting is to count number of zeros in the original weight matrix, which will be much more efficient than using Hessian matrix to calculate the theoretical pruning rate. I understand that the theoretical pruning rate may also make values with small magnitude to be pruned, however, you can achieve the similar results by simply increasing $\\lambda$ in Eq.3. If you think $L_1$ regularization cannot accurately control the pruning rate, then $L_0$ regularization [1] can achieve this, which is also differentiable.  As a result, I doubt the practical usage of the proposed method.\n3. Since the theoretical analysis did not include $\\lambda$ in Eq.3, it brings some additional problems. For example, modern deep neural network training could be very expensive, assume we trained a model, and we calculate the theoretical pruning rate. But this pruning rate does not meet our expectation, then the only thing we can do is to adjust the $\\lambda$ and retrain the model. We never know the theoretical pruning rate before the model is fully trained. As a result, the theoretical pruning rate does not give a better guidance when we want to train a model given an expected pruning rate. \n4. The pruning method itself is not novel, it is simply $L_1$ regularized training + magnitude pruning. \n\n[1] LEARNING SPARSE NEURAL NETWORKS THROUGH L0 REGULARIZATION. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01312.pdf"

This is an open question just for discussion. Is it possible for your current theoretical framework to incorporate $\\lambda$ to predict the final theoretical pruning rate? Is it possible for your current framework to use the theoretical pruning rate of an early trained model to predict the pruning rate of the fully trained model?"
