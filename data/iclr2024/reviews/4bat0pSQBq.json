The Digital Elevation Map (DEM) of the region is provided as an input. The model is based on the laws analogous to conservation of mass and momentum to govern the flow of water from one region to another, depending on the height and amount of water already accumulated. It is shown that this model can simulate the spreading of flood more accurately than other ML-based models, especially in the early stages of the flood."

The difference between CommGNN- and CommGNN is in the water retention capacity. Does it then indicate that it is this aspect, and not the model itself, which has most impact? If that is the case, then shouldn't we be trying to incorporate the water retention aspect in the existing architectures rather than proposing a new architecture?\n3) We have no results on how the proposed approach compares with the hydrological/hydrodynamic models used by domain scientists for flood simulation."

To facilitate modeling, the region is discretized into sub-regions, each \nrepresented as a graph node. The GNN comprises multiple sequential message-passing (MP) layers \ndesigned to process and propagate local information, drawing inspiration from the physical \nprinciples of mass and momentum transport as described by the shallow water equations (SWE). In \naddition to this, two other physical inductive biases are considered: (i) the orientation of graph \nedges between nodes follows the steepest descent direction, with only one outgoing edge per \nnode/sub-region, and (ii) a retention layer is applied before each MP layer to account for water \naccumulation at each sub-region due to local precipitation. The model produces temporal rollouts by \nrecursive evaluation.\n\nThis model was trained and tested using empirical precipitation data and corresponding simulated \nflooding data. The performance of the model was compared against that of an MLP, a U-Net, two \npopular GNNs, and a baseline GNN previously proposed for flood modeling. The proposed model \noutperforms the baselines, particularly in early-stage flood simulations."

It seems not to be the goal to improve the accuracy, since the model is trained with simulated \nflooding data. Is it accelerating the simulation? Runtime comparisons with numerical solvers are \nnot included in the paper.\n\n2. Solely from a deep-learning viewpoint, the contributions are not significant. Another \"species\" \nof message passing is added to an already vast range of options.\n\n3. The term \"physics-informed\" used in the title is not well chosen in my opinion. This may lead to confusion \nwith Physics-Inspired Neural Networks (PINNs), where the governing equations are included \nin the loss function. Instead, something along the lines of \"physical inductive-bias\" would be more suitable.\n\n4. The use of a single out-going edge per node assumes that the information is only propagated \ndownhill. This may not be true for later-stage flood simulations. The authors should verify \nand indicate if this inductive bias is actually helpful for test case here considered. Its possible \ndrawbacks should be discussed. It seems like a clear limitation for other settings without such\na strongly biased transport.\n\n5. The authors mention the previous work of Bentivoglio et al. (2023) and Kazadi et al. (2022), \nhowever, other similar research is missing. E.g.,\n* Oliveira Santos V, Costa Rocha PA, Scott J, Th JVG, Gharabaghi B. A New Graph-Based \nDeep Learning Model to Predict Flooding with Validation on a Case Study on the Humber \nRiver. Water. 2023; 15(10):1827. https://doi.org/10.3390/w15101827\n* Farahmand, H., Xu, Y. & Mostafavi, A.

Sci Rep 13, 6768 \n(2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32548-x\nIn these two articles, the flooding models account for past states as opposed to the model \nproposed here. The authors should discuss if that is needed or not. It may happen that only \nthe current state is relevant for inferring the water depth at the next time-point due to the \ndeterministic nature of the problem.\n\n6. Whilst the model is compared to other GNNs and the GNN proposed by Bentivoglio et al. \n(2023), it is not compared against the Interaction Networks (Battaglia et al. 2016), which were \nshown to very suitable for Lagragian and Eurlarian simulations of fluids (Pfaff et al. 2021, \nSanchez-Gonzalez et al. 2020)."

The loss term in equation (8) penalizes the prediction of negative water depths, however, is \nnot better to enforce the satisfaction of this condition by the use of ReLU activation after the \nlast layer?\n\n2. What is the number of parameters of each model? This is a crucial factor that usually directly determines the performance.\n\nAnd 2 minor points:\n\n3. Wrong formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient, it seems to repeat NSE?\n\n4. Other research has considered back-propagating through multiple evaluations of the model. Could this be beneficial for the flood forecasting and long-term stability?\n\n________\n\nPost-rebuttal:\n\nI'd like to thank the reviewers for the detailed update.  It is good to see that it outperforms a series of popular MP algorithms in early flooding stages. It would be important, however, to make sure all models have the same number of parameter. It seems the current comparison uses significantly different sizes.\n\nSo overall, I think the submission is improving, but I believe there are still quite a few open questions: beyond a thorough baseline comparison, the runtime would be interesting, and potentially a more detailed derivation of the method or a demonstration of broader applicability. As such I will keep my score, I'm still leaning towards the rejection side."

                "value": "The paper presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) model, named ComGNN, designed for early-stage flood simulation. The model innovatively incorporates physical laws, specifically the conservation of momentum and mass from the shallow-water equations, into its framework. It operates on real-world, spatially distributed rainfall data to predict water depth over time, addressing the shortcomings of traditional hydrodynamic models and previous ML-based methods. ComGNN stands out for its two-stage approach, which first accounts for water retention at the rainfall site and then simulates the water's propagation throughout the region. The model demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, particularly in early flood stages, which is critical for timely flood risk mitigation. It's trained on real-world data from nine regions and seven historical precipitation events, showing promising results, especially in reducing root mean square error (RMSE) when predicting water depths."

                "value": "1.\tThe author asserts the novelty of the ComGNN model; however, the distinctiveness of its design beyond the described pipeline remains unclear. It would be prudent for the author to provide a more detailed account of the model's architecture or to draw comparisons with existing frameworks to more effectively underscore the innovative aspects of ComGNN.\n2.\tWithin Equations 1 to 4, the manuscript appears to describe the application of a learnable multilayer perceptron (MLP) for predicting or learning the solutions of partial differential equations in the context of the conversation process. This approach does not seem to offer substantial theoretical advancement to the field. Could the author provide a more in-depth explanation of the theoretical underpinnings to clarify the contribution?\n3.\tThe message passing scheme, a prominent feature in the title, does not convey extensive information. Would the author kindly provide relevant references for this scheme? It appears to resemble standard data flow in GNN architectures. Additionally, a precise initial definition of 'message' along with a more comprehensive explanation would be beneficial for clarity.\n4.\tToo much experimental figures in page 8 and 9 which makes main contents too short, author could move them in to appendix and leave more room for theoretical analysis.\n5.\tThe current formulation of the problem may be overly simplistic for readers not well-versed in the field. It would be advisable to include the mathematical model within this section to enhance comprehension."

                "value": "In summary, the paper offers ComGNN, a graph neural network that simulates early-stage flood progression by accounting for rainfall retention and water propagation based on conservation principles. The authors claim that their method shows superior performance in comparison to existing approaches, especially for early flood stages, validated through empirical results on historical flood data. However,  it put too much contents in application and exrimanetal explanation and results but overlook the theoretical part, which is not suitable for ICLR. Moverover, the novelty of ComGNN didn\u2019t revealed sufficiently in the method part."
