I appreciate that the authors did an ablation study on the KL constraint, but PPO has other benefits in comparison with Reinforce \n1. Details of the backbone model are not given. Is it a standard GPT model? Was the tokenizer standard or also trained? \n1. It is not clear why the authors chose GPT-style model as opposed to BERT style model, where the whole sequences can be predicted directly. This approach was used, e.g  by Cowen-Rivers et al albeit for a different problem and with a different RL algorithm. A discussion on the subject would be interesting.\n1. Haarnoja et al 2018 proposed an automatic tuning procedure of entropy that can explicitly state the target level of entropy. It would be interesting to have this as ablation as well. \n1. I am confused about referencing Mnih et al 2013 regarding the use of replay buffer for on-policy algorithms. Don\u2019t Mnih et al use an off-policy algorithm? \n1. Furthermore, I am not quite sure what a replay buffer for on-policy algorithm means. Does it mean that we use samples for several previous iterations not just the most recent one?\n1. The results could be displayed better, with this scale the improvement of the model does not seem too large, but could be deceptive. \n1.

Even with a finite trajectory, a discount rate smaller than 1 is not obligatory, it can also help. A discount rate of 1 can prevent the agent from learning and executing long-term tasks, as it won't appropriately discount long-term returns, leading it to prioritize immediate rewards and neglect long-term benefits. It is suggested to justify this setting.\n\n2. REINFORCE is a very classic yet old algorithm. It is highly recommend to try more recent algorithms, e.g., TROP or PPO. I am not an exert in RL for molecular optimization, but I doubt whether it is the state-of-the-art RL algorithm in this field. For example, (i) due to its reliance on stochastic policies and simple optimization methods, REINFORCE can be more susceptible to getting stuck in local optima, making it less effective in complex and high-dimensional environments; (ii) due to its on-policy mechanism, REINFORCE requires a large number of samples to estimate gradients accurately. This can make it computationally expensive and slow for complex tasks and environments. \n\n3. It would be more convincing if domain experts can help to judge the effectiveness of ChemRLformer from molecular's perspective."
