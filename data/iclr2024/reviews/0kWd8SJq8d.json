Since MINDE, and in particular MINDE-$\\sigma$, is based on the same principle, such a comparison seems natural.\n\n2) The paper mentions previous similar work on diffusion-based mutual information estimation [3], which differs in the derivation and modeling choices. Nevertheless, this work is not included in the experimental comparison, and the advantages of MINDE are not further elaborated.\n\n3) No discussion regarding the computational cost or challenges of training MINDE compared to the other models in the literature is included in the main text.\n\n### Minor Remarks\n1) The main text includes in-depth technical details with an extensive notation. If on one hand, this helps to verify the soundness of the derivation, on the other, it makes following the main derivation more difficult. I believe that submission could benefit by including additional intuition to guide the reader.\n\n2) The plots in Figures 1 and 2 are quite small and difficult to read\n\n### References\n[1] McAllester, David, and Karl Stratos. \"Formal limitations on the measurement of mutual information.\" International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics.

The number of training data points can vary between 100, 1K, 10K, and 100K. Can you do this for a varying number of dimensions as well and report results for different estimators?\n\nInfoNCE seems to be doing a very good job, can you come up with an overall score to rank the methods? Does InfoNCE also require a large dataset with the same size as yours?\n\nCan you include time comparisons between different models? I assume learning the score functions from a diffusion process for the joint probability distribution would be an overkill if one only cares about the MI or H. What\u2019s the training time comparison between different models and how do the authors account for computational resources used by various models?\n\nDiffusion processes are known to outperform other density estimators in various settings. Therefore it\u2019s no surprise if it achieves better an estimation of MI and H. That said, I\u2019m having a hard time determining what the main contributions are. I imagine that the main contributions are representing MI and H as quantities that incorporate score functions. However, the connections between KL, score, MI, H are known results in the information theory literature [cite]. Is the extension of those results to the diffusion process (as opposed to generic densities) non-trivial? Is there something critical that I\u2019m missing?\n\nThe paper would benefit from reorganization in my opinion. The notations used in the paper as well as the organization of the sections make it difficult to follow the arguments of the paper. The contributions start appearing very late in the paper and there is a large amount of background which might not be necessary for the main arguments. I suggest the following organization:\n* Simple intro to diffusion models (no need to include the measure theoretical notation as it\u2019s mainly used for the proofs and can be transported to the supplementary).\n* Introducing the joint diffusion model (4.1) and MINDE.\n* Making connections between MI and H, score functions, and KL divergence.\n\nA recent paper [1] discusses that the absolute continuity assumption made in the paper might not hold given the architecture of the neural network used for approximating the score function (the cited paper discusses it in the context of functional variational inference but intuitively the same arguments should hold for diffusion process). In this case, the KL divergence will be infinity and the MI and H estimators developed will be ill-defined. Can the authors articulate the underlying assumptions further and explain what datasets can benefit from the estimators developed in the paper?\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09421"

The ideas are intriguing, and the results are impressive. So, the rest of this review will focus on the issues for me understanding the methods and results.\n\n1. The biggest issue for me is that I almost immediately got lost.  I know information theory pretty well, I learned it from Fred Jelinek before he died. That said, I know very little about diffusion processes and SDEs. My main confusion with this paper was about connecting the math on diffusion processes to the process of estimating MI. There is a leap, which I am willing to believe is justified, that I completely missed.  Why are we talking about a filtration and an Ito process at all?  How do they related to the joint distribution F_{X,Y}? I read the words in Section 2-4, but was completely lost.  To be fair, I was also lost the first time I read the KSG paper (https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.69.066138).  I imagine lots of people might have followed the logic and derivation completely. But not me, I just didn't get it. And I spent some time trying to figure it out, as I'd like to get it, it seems cool, and within the realm of possibilities that I did get it, but I didn't. I thought maybe reading Appendix D would help me, but it didn't really help either.  In the end, I don't quite know what you did, or why you did it.  I would love something like Algorithm 1 and 2, which perhaps points to subroutines for how each relevant quantity is computed. For example, I don't see how to do \"r.h.s. Eq. (16)\". Where does 'g' come from, or k, or T? etc.\n\n2. In terms of the numerical results, I think I understand them, which was exciting for me! Figure 1 shows that MINDE works about as well as other things on relatively easy problems where there is enough data, and slightly better on a spiral dataset when MI is high.  That's cool as far as it goes.  I'm always interested in *finite sample properties* for my estimators, because I always have finite data.  In particular, I often work on biomedical problems, in which sample sizes are typically hundreds.  So, I would be much more interested in seeing plots showing accuracy as a function of sample size, especially for the \"easy\" ones where many different estimators are getting the right answer. This introduces additional information about convergence rates. The fact that 2 high-dimensional simulations showed it does as well as other things, and one showed it is slightly better for some parametrization, I found not that compelling.\n\n3. I understand why the authors say that the benchmark consists of 40 tasks.  However, in my opinion, this wording is confusing and misrepresenting the work. I would say that there are about 10 different tasks, with an average of 4 different parameterizations per task. Consider, for example, our paper https://elifesciences.org/articles/41690. We describe 20 tasks, but in Figure 2, we should many different parameterizations (dimensions) per task. Claiming that we had more than 20 tasks, in my opinion, would not be in integrity.  Varying parameters, dimensions, and sample sizes for a particular task is important, but claiming that each different parameterization is a different task seems inappropriate to me. Of note, the Czyz et al paper from which the tasks are extracted never seems to make such a claim. Rather, they name about 10 different tasks explicitly.\n\n4. The claim that MINDE outperforms other approaches on 35/40 tasks I also question. No errorbars are provided.  While this is typical in machine learning benchmark comparisons, I think the practice is ill-advised and misleading.  Without errorbars, there is no evidence that if one ran the exact same code again, how likely is it that the results would be similarly ordered.  There is a rich history of non-parametric tests for evaluating whether one estimator tends to be better than another, and I would encourage the authors to only claim something is better when there is statistical evidence supporting the claim. \n\n5. Directly using kernel density estimators and plugging them into the MI equations, or using the standard approaches to estimating mutual information (eg, KSG, which is included in sklearn), to compare with the neural methods, would also be important."

Clarify how many different settings were considered, and discuss from that perspective.\n4. More clear/complete pseudocode."
