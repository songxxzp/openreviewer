                "value": "This paper aims to address the suboptimality that arises from the behavior regularization w.r.t the suboptimal datasets in policy-constraint-based offline RL methods. Specifically, this paper casts policy constraints on an iteratively evolved reference policy $\\bar{\\pi}$ rather than the suboptimal behavior policy $\\pi_D$. Theoretical analysis proves that this iteratively evolved policy constraint can not only avoid OOD queries but also achieves in-sample optimality when the initial reference policy $\\bar{\\pi}$ is initialized to $\\pi_D$ under the full-data-coverage assumption that the optimzied policy $\\pi$ should always stay in the support of the reference policy $\\bar{\\pi}$. However, for practical implementation, this paper also applies constraints on the suboptimal behavior policy to stablize training, where the constraint strength between $\\pi_D$ and $\\bar{\\pi}$ are balanced by an newly introduced hyper-parameter. This paper also provides extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

                "value": "## Major weakness\nThe performance improvement seems to primarily stem from comprehensive parameter tuning, rather than the proposed  iterative refinement of policy constraints. CPI can be viewed as adding an additional iteratively refined policy constraint to TD3+BC, while introducing a new hyperparameter $\\lambda$ to adjust the constraint strengths. In my view, this is doing some kind of conservatism relaxation and introduces an additional hyperparameter, providing a more precise adjustment of conservatism strengths than solely tuning the $\\tau$. Consequently, this leads to performance gains compared to the base method, TD3+BC.\n\nSee from Table 3 and Table 4 that hyper-parameters are thoroughly tuned for each individual task. Moreover, Table 5 shows that TD3+BC (dynamic $\\alpha$) is on par with CPI and CPI-RE. This indicates that TD3+BC might also achieve in-sample optimality and meanwhile prevents OOD issues with a carefully sweeped conservatism strength $\\alpha$.\n\nI would consider raise my score if the major weakness is well resolved.\n\n## Minor weakness\nThe idea about utilizing an iteratively refined policy constraint is already introduced by a recent offline2online RL paper[1], which is stated as a future research in Conclusion.\n\n[1] PROTO: Iterative Policy Regularized Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning. 2023.\n\n## Typo\n1.

Additionally, the algorithm box lacks clarity, which is elaborated upon in the questions section.\n\n2. The paper's originality and novelty appear limited. The newly introduced component merely utilizes a target policy network for KL regularization\u2014a technique already employed in algorithms like TRPO and PPO. My interpretation suggests that the paper's primary contribution is a trick that demonstrates how integrating a conservative policy update can enhance offline RL.\n\n3. The scope of testing is narrow. Evaluating only on TD3+BC doesn't provide enough evidence to support the universal benefits of adding conservative policy learning. The authors claim that implementing their method requires minimal modifications to existing algorithms. If so, it would be beneficial to test it on other frameworks like IQL, CQL, and Diffusion-QL."
