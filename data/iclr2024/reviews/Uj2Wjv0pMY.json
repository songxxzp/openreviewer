The paper fails to validate the necessities of such modality. One crucial different between assembly dataset is use of depth values. What role does it play in training baseline models?

In current deep learning area, depth channels should be reasonably be producible via the help of existing models. \n\n\u2022\tI\u2019m not convinced that the binary classification is a justifiable baseline metrics. While I agree with the TAL task is really important here and a good problem to solve, I\u2019m not sure how coarse grained binary classification can assess models understanding of fine-grained error like technique error. \n\n\u2022\tTiming Error (Duration of an activity) and Temperature based error, does these really need ML based solutions? In sensitive tasks, simple sensor reading can indicate error. I\u2019m not sure testing computer vision models on such tasks is justifiable. These require more heuristics-based methods, working with if-else statement. \n\n\u2022\tProcedure Learning: its very vaguely defined, mostly left unexplained and seems like an after thought. I recommend authors devote passage to methods \u201cM1 (Dwibedi et al., 2019)\u201d and \u201cM2 (Bansal, Siddhant et al., 2022)\u201d. In Table 5, value of lambda?

For example if the person uses a tablespoon instead of teaspoon, is still an error? Some errors are more grave than others, is there a weighted scores? Is there a way to measure level of deviation for each type of error or time stamp of occurrence of error. Is one recipe more difficult than the other recipe."

By looking at Table 1, the proposed dataset are bucked in small or medium compared with the existing ones in terms of number of videos or number of hours, and even number of tasks. The only difference may be that the proposed dataset provides more modalities. However, experiments shown in the paper only used RGB so far. Another claim made by the paper is that it has more error instances (compared by error:normal ratio) than Assembly101, which is true. However, the ways of capturing error videos have some problems: in three scenario of capturing error videos (sec 3.1.2), the first twos were scripted, the last one is instructed. Although it helps providing more error videos, however, those error videos will be intentional (the mistakes won't look realistic). In practice, the unintentional mistakes or errors are more relevant and often happened in reality.\n2. The baselines provide not much insights.\n- For Error Recognition (Table 2 & 3), the observation is Omnivore is the best backbone / embedding for error / normal video classification. The early prediction problem is still formulated as classification with partly-observed data. The same finding is confirmed (Omnivore works best for this, this brings no surprise as both are technically the same problem, the later one is a bit harder).\n- For Multi-Step Localization, the problem is formulated as supervised TAL and the same set of features are used and a ActionFormer head was use for localization. The same finding is that Omnivore works best.\n- For procedure learning: Two baselines (Dwibedi et al. 2019 and Siddhant et al. 2022) were used and provided similar performance. No real insights were observed in this experiments.\n- Since this paper is about the new dataset which is claimed to focus on error recognition, however there not much new insights about the significance of bringing more error videos to procedural video dataset: neither in the way data is captured or significant baselines, experiments to demonstrate why it matters?\n\n3. Writing is not clear in some parts\n- In 4.2, is the supervised TAL trained task-agnostically or task-specifically, meaning TAL is trained for all or per tasks (24 recipes)"
