There is a lot of work in FL on sporadic communication as well as compression and asynchronous methods to speed up the actual communication process. Sporadic local updates is more interesting but just allowing local gradient updates to either happen or not happen (without specifying what is the optimal rate or schedule for this) does not seem to be a large improvement in the field.\n2. Strong convexity assumption is ok, but not that realistic in ML today (where most training is non-convex).\n3. Empirical testing was on only one smaller dataset, with no relevant baselines (FedAvg is a must to include), and not much improvement is showcased overall (especially when other asynchronous or compression methods can better reduce delay)."

This is very important as much of the analysis showcases convergence to a first-order stationary point (FOSP) and not the true optimality gap.\n    - If convexity isn't that strong (small $\\mu$), then the suboptimality grows inversely $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{2}{\\mu})$ in Equation (9)\n3. Can convergence be shown in the standard FOSP manner with the non-convexity (relaxing convexity assumptions)? \n4. There is no guidance for how to know or select the expected connectivity of links between devices as well as the expected sporadicity of local gradient updates. How should they be selected to optimize training and boost performance? Ablation studies are necessary for studying this phenomena.\n5. DSpoFL does not seem to outperform Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) in raw iteration testing. Comparison against FedAvg is a must since multiple local updates before communication also reduces communication costs and is shown to improve accuracy. DSpoFL should be compared with a range of similar communication-efficient algorithms (and should hopefully outperform them)."

To solve this problem, the authors propose the DSpodFL algorithm, which introduces sporadic local stochastic gradient descent (SGD) computations and model aggregations among nodes. Specifically, at each iteration, each node conducts local SGD with some probability and each communication link activates with some probability. Their analysis shows that the proposed DSpodFL achieves a geometric convergence rate to a neighborhood of the globally optimal solution for a constant SGD step size, in a strongly convex and smooth setting. They conduct some numerical experiments to demonstrate the superior performance of DSpodFL compared to the existing baselines."
