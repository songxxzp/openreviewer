For example you can use them to generate more examples in different resolutions or even \"image-to-image\" translation methods. Thus, I think the argument of treating augmentations visually different in Figure 1 is not very clear. While it mentions that augmentations are not \"accurate\", I think this will largely depend on the domain/data. I also think another aspect to consider is the computational time.`\n- I believe this paper is highly dependent on the accuracy of the diffusion model and while a theoretical investigation would further clarify this, I think it is worth mentioning. For example, in tabular data settings, diffusion models may not work so effectively or perhaps when data to train the diffusion model itself is scarce. Noting that diffusion models are quite data hungry, I'm not sure if it will be a great idea to use them to bootstrap in general."

I understand this is what we expect however it could be the case that the test data is very simple to learn and the training data is complicated, resulting in a smaller ELBO over train. I would amend this statement to say \u201cwe anticipate after training G_g \\geq 0$ as opposed to keeping it as a statement by itself.\n\nHave you tried other types of generative models to bootstrap a VAE? For example, what if you use a GAN since they can be quite robust. Also, GANs can be used to generate synthetic augmentation and thus lie in the \"accurate\" region in between augmentation and diffusion.\n\nOther:\nFull stop page 1: \"robustness For generative modeling\" -> \"robustness.

Yet, the paper primarily focuses on image generation, a task for which the diffusion model already excels. The computational overhead introduced by the proposed method seems substantial.
