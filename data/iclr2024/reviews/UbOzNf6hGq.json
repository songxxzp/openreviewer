Its training extends the masked language modeling objective by adopting\nvarying mask probabilities sampled from the Beta distribution to enhance the generative capabilities of FiLM. During inference, FiLM can seamlessly insert missing phrases, sentences, or paragraphs, ensuring that the outputs are fluent and are coherent with the surrounding context. In both automatic and human evaluations, FiLM outperforms existing infilling methods that rely on left-to-right language models trained on rearranged text segments. FiLM is easy to implement and can be either trained from scratch or fine-tuned from a left-to-right language model.  The results are promising"

FiLM is trained using a novel masking schedule based on a Beta distribution, which is shown in this paper to outperform the fixed masking probability and a uniform distribution in terms of achieving lower perplexities on eval datasets. FiLM can be trained on pretrained foundation models that are either masked LMs (MLMs) or causal LMs (CLMs). The authors conducted experiments with RoBERTa as an example of the MLMs and with GPT-2 as an example of CLMs. The authors show that FiLMs achieve substantially higher ROGUE scores (indicating higher quality) for the text infilling task compared to a causal masking (CM) baselines. On a causal language modeling benchmark, FiLM show worse (higher) perplexity compared to a traditional CLM, which was expected. But these perplexity gaps diminish with increasing model size. The authors also provide a few concrete examples of text filled in by FiLM and compared them with outputs of CM on the same input prompts, showing a clear advantage in terms of the coherence of the filled text by FiLM. Evaluation of infilling results based on human raters and GPT-4 show a clear overall preference for FiLM compared to CLMs."

Therefore it remains to be shown that the infilling capability of FiLM can be extended to text domains unseen during training. This feels important for the practical usefulness of FiLM in real-world applications. \nW3. Relating to point W2 above, the author should better motivate FiLM and its infilling capability.

A question related to Q1 was how the GPT4 model was prompted to perform the rating task, including the prompt template, the sampling temperature, etc.\nQ3. What tokenizer(s) did the RoBERTa and GPT-2 models use? For fair comparisons (e.g., results in Figure 5), they ought to be based on the same tokenizer. Some tokenizers are at the subword level. For example, is it possible that certain words are split into two parts and masked partially during mask generation? How does this affect the training, decoding, and human evaluation?\nQ4. How do the training examples look like? What is the output shape of FiLM? Is it the set of probability scores over the vocabulary for a single token, or the sets of scores for multiple tokens. This is related to the question whether a sequence with N masks (where N can be >1 in general) yields a single or multiple (N) training examples.\nQ5. There seems to be some discrepancy between Figures 6 and 7 (right panels). While Figure 6 Right Panel shows only the eval results from GPT4, Figure 7 Right Panels show both human and GPT4 rating results. Why not show human rating results in Figure 6 (i.e., for the WikiText-103 and 1BW datasets) as well?"

                "value": "Disadvantages:\n\n - Unfair Comparison: Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems to me the comparison in the infilling task can be unfair. The formulation of FiLM implicitly assumed the total number of infilled tokens, whereas this is not the information that CM-based infilling models know. You may have observed that the output from CM-based infilling models usually are longer compared to FiLM's. This could cause extra difficulties for CM-based infilling and eventually make the comparison unfair and less meaningful.\n - Training/Inference Discrepancy: It seems to me while the proposed mask scheduler can alleviate it, there's still a training/inference behaviorial inconsistency in the proposed algorithm. I would appreciate it if some ablation study can be conducted to show how effective the advanced beta-Distribution-guided masking is and how severe is this discrepancy.\n - Under Explored Backgrounds: There are many preliminary works that seem relevant but not discussed or even mentioned in the paper. InDIGO [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01370], for example, is one of the first attempts at generating text in arbitrary order using insertion-based models. It even has an advantage against the proposed approach that it does not assume the length of span of the infilling. Following InDIGO there are also other insertion-based models that can achieve the same goal and can be trained efficiently, like InsNet [https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11008]."
