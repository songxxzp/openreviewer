For example, the sentence \u201cIt si similar to the CLIP-diffusion model\u201d seems to be \u201cIt is similar to the CLIP-diffusion model\u201d. I suggest that the authors proofread the paper carefully to avoid these.\n\n(2) It is suggested to check the format and completeness of references in the paper. For example, it is incorrect to list reference as Shen et al. (2023), it should be (Shen et al., 2023). In addition, there are some places where references are missing, such as the sentence \u201cBig models in both of CV and NLP area, like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion\u201d in INTRODUCTION.\n\n(3) The way of citing pictures in the paper is suggested to use Fig. 5, 6 instead of directly an index.  For example, \u201cthe visualized results5\u201d, \u201cin different perspectives in 5\u201d and \u201cby SD in 6\u201d in Section 4.3.\n\n(4) In the experimental results, there are only some visualization results.
