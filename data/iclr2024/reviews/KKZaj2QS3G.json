Thus, I would doubt the usefulness of the proposed method.\n2. Writing and English need to be improved. I\u2019ll give 3 examples but there are more scattering around the entire paper. (1) for Figure 2, it is very confusing which part I should be looking at when reading the corresponding text in Section 2.2.

                "value": "The paper does not do a good job positioning itself in the vast literature of timeseries modeling. Some key statements in the paper show this issue more clearly. For example:\n\n\"A common shortcoming emerges in existing methods: none explicitly address noise in time series data alongside an appropriate strategy for handling this unwanted signal. Unlike other data types, real-world time series often harbor substantial noise, severely impacting task accuracy\"\n\nThis statement is hard to accept. Of course all or most prior work in this area considers that the time series will be noisy. This is one of the main reasons we use neural networks, as opposed to other models that are much less capable to deal with noisy data. \n\nThen, there are some sentences that are hard to understand. For example: \n\n\"we devise a sampling strategy based on the insight that the noisy signal combined with the original series shouldn\u2019t disrupt time series frameworks. In essence, frameworks should produce consistent representations given noise-free or raw series (noise-resiliency characteristics).\"\n\nWhat \"Frameworks\" are the authors talking about? \n\nAdditionally, there are some aspects of the model, or claims about the model, that are very basic but they are presented as an important technical contribution. For example:\n\n\"To achieve this, we shift our focus from the temporal domain to the spectral domain. Here, we employ a spectrum-based low-pass filter to create correlated yet distinct views of each input time series. These augmented views serve as positive samples of the raw series, effectively capturing the desired noise invariance. The advantages of this low-pass filter-based augmentation are twofold: (1) the filter preserves key characteristics such as trend and seasonality, ensuring deterministic and interpretable representations; (2) it eliminates noise-prone high-frequency components, improving noise resilience and enhancing downstream task performance by aligning the raw signal representation with the augmented view\"\n\nOf course there is nothing particularly new in the previous paragraph. Working in the spectral domain and performing LPF to remove high-frequency noise are elementary operations that are typically taught at the level of undergraduate signal processing courses. \n \nConsidering the previous weaknesses, it is hard to provide specific technical comments to the authors, given that (at least to this reviewer) it is not clear if the paper has something really new to contribute in the area of timeseries modeling."

The authors investigates the existence and impacts of noise in time series representation learning and introduces a noise-resilient sampling strategy to learn consistent representations despite the noise."

It investigates the existence and impacts of noise in time series representation learning, addressing a critical factor that affects the efficacy of time series tasks.\n\nQuality: The authors provide empirical validation of the proposed CoInception framework and compares it with recent state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating consistent outperformance in forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection tasks. The experiments highlight the effectiveness of the framework in learning informative representations robust to various downstream tasks.\n\nClarity: The paper clearly presents the motivation, challenges, and contributions of the research, as well as the design principles of the framework. It also provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method, highlighting the best results for better comparison.\n\nSignificance: The authors address the gap in existing works by exploring the potential of unsupervised representation learning in time series data. The proposed framework offers a solution for learning informative representations without the need for costly and difficult labeling, particularly in privacy-sensitive fields like healthcare and finance. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches, indicating its significance in advancing time series analysis."

This could hinder a deeper understanding of the trade-offs and potential challenges in implementing and applying the CoInception framework in real-world scenarios.\n\n3.Lack of comparison with more recent and diverse state-of-the-art methods in time series representation learning, beyond the ones mentioned in the paper. This could limit the comprehensive evaluation of the proposed CoInception framework and its performance against a wider range of approaches."

As mentioned by the authors, the DWT method in this paper is capable of filtering out high-frequency noise. How can useful high-frequency data be preserved and what trade-offs are made in addressing this issue?\n\n2. Could you provide a clearer explanation of the Inception Block in the Method section, including an explanation of the meanings of variables like $b$ and $h$ in Figure 3 (a), as well as the significance of the numbers in brackets? This would help in better understanding this paper.\n\n3. The comparison with baselines could be more comprehensive. I believe it would be more convincing if the authors could compare their method to recent approaches from the past two years, such as TimesNet [1].\n\n[1] Wu, Haixu, et al. \"TimesNet: Temporal 2D-Variation Modeling for General Time Series Analysis.\" The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations. 2022."
