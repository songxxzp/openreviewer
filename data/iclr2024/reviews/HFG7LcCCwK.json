For instance, as seen in the experiments within the paper, they are entirely simulated cases. I find this to be not very practical.\n- If the authors could provide some simulation data in the experimental section, it would better support the conclusions in the paper. This is because, when relying solely on image data, evaluation metrics can sometimes be less accurate.\n- Could the authors provide some failure cases, where the situations that would occur if the assumptions in the paper are not met?"

Usage of visual means (schematic illustrations).\n* Discussion of Algorithm 1's steps\n* Reasonable semi-synthetic extension for real-world data\n* An effort of a self-enclosed treatise i.e., theory + empirics"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "TL;DR: Respectfully, the authors should not feel attacked by any of the following, mostly, I feel like ignoring many of the \"weaknesses\" but at the core of this section really stands the heavy overreliance on the causal side of things, even though the project is intended as a work on the intersection to ML. The lack of discussions on the other end essentially invalidates the key contribution, the ID-DAG algorithm, as simply being a copy of Shpitser & Pearl's simplified version of Tian's original algorithm, just that we have to use actual samples and models instead of magically having the actual probability distributions at hand. This is precisely what ML is in essence, and discussing characteristics w.r.t. learning, and not the causal part that we already know of by Shpitser, Pearl and others, would have been exactly this paper's key contribution.\n\nThe paper suffers from several disadvantages, ranging in importance from minor to more fundamental (and the minor ones, especially w.r.t. presentation, can be improved quickly). Thereby, the following list - again one-by-one - aims to provide specific pointers with improvement suggestions if applicable (please note, the list is unordered):\n\n* While agreeing with the sentiment that estimating high dimensional, arbitrary conditional distributions to arbitrary precision is difficult, doing so in a more general sense is not and there exist different ways of handling this (just through Bayes' rule or through explicit modelling or through approximations). It comes to mind that in the introduction all Pearl related work (the causal side of things) are described precisely, whereas there is no reference whatsoever to works on the generative side of things apart from the handful of deep models. For example, following the difficulties encountered with Bayesian Networks's inference, advances were made on probabilistic circuits by Darwiche, Poon, Domingos, Perharz, Vergari, Van den Broeck and many others. In said realm, there are even first results on causality both w.r.t inference and sampling (as discussed in this work). To point the authors to concrete works, I link the following (sorted by date): NeurIPS 2021, \"Interventional Sum-Product Networks: Causal Inference with Tractable Probabilistic Models\" and AISTATS 2023 \"Compositional Probabilistic and Causal Inference using Tractable Circuit Models\". By now there are probably a lot more works out there, which is why I'd kindly encourage the authors to have an extensive look at all of these related works.\n* The background section clearly suffers from overloading. Many concepts are needed for the work, however, this work should not be considered as an introductory lecture and given the space limitations IMHO they are the things (as opposed to others listed below that) should arguably be placed in the appendix in a more appropriate manner, covering only the highly relevant prerequisites in the background section.\n* $X$ is not defined in Lemma 3.3.\n* $P_x(y)$ is not defined when first introduced in Lemma 3.3.\n* Please consider improving figure presentation alongside the following three dimensions: (i) proportions, especially Figures 2,3,4,5 suffer from for example small font sizes that make zooming a necessity, (ii) descriptions, legends for things like color codes within the figure & figure caption are missing but also generally the captions do not even work as capturing a \"take-away message\" let alone as being self-enclosed means of communicating the figure's ideas, and (iii) consistency, for example Figure 3 has \\sum written out (as a not compiled normal text).\n* Visual components, shaded quadrangle and circular node, are both not defined in Figure 3. Unlike the examples before, one cannot conclude anything (which is unfortunate since this is exactly the interesting part). Labels, as previously, for training and sampling phases are missing.\n* As a fun nod, when looking closely since it is quite ironic, but DAGs are actually never defined. The paper begins with ADMGs and then abandons them through replacement with DAGs without any notice. Said DAGs further give a false sense of generality of the result since ADMGs are a generalization of DAGs.\n* $\\pi$ in Algorithm 1 is not defined.\n* Key parts of the algorithm s.a. ConstructDAG or Step 7's modification are not being discussed in the main paper.\n* Most severe contribution issue: the \"key contribution\" as the author's put it, Algorithm 1, is identical to Algorithm in Figure 3 of Ilya Shpitser and Judea Pearl \"Identification of joint interventional distributions in recursive semi-Markovian causal models\" (AAAI 2006) up to the sampling network part, which does not become apparent whatsoever through the paper's discussions. Furthermore, the lack of characterization nullifies this contribution and quickly renders the situation a pure application of these prior results but without an actual emphasis on the application part.\n* Most severe writing issue: Theorem 4.1. is neither covered nor proven in the main paper. It is quite evident that the style of writing chosen by the authors (based on the insights from this whole section) is based on \"exploiting\" the appendix for more presentation space, this goes against the submission guidelines of ICLR (and while not as severe as something like non-anonymity, it could still warrant a discussion of desk rejection). I've thoroughly checked the appendix, however, it is important to note that this is not a requirement for the reviewer and specifically so because of the fact that otherwise the meaning of the 9-page main paper would be rendered meaningless. Personally, this does not bother me since I'm content-centric, however, this is a conflict with the conference's guidelines and needs to be covered.\n* IDTrain in Section 5 is not defined.\n* The experimental section evaluation is rather a protocol, than it is an interpretation/discussion of the observed results. The resolution on Fig.5 even on highest zoom does not allow a proper inspection. Still, it seems that \"regular\" diffusion-based issues arise as well (however, to be expected).\n\n\nThis final list is a list of suggestions with concrete ideas that can hopefully help the authors improve their work, as this review is intended as a means of constructive feedback i.e., to help the author's contribution be a great one for the community:\n\n* Please consider using \\citep{} for non-direct references like the ones in the introduction. Especially since the citations are not highlighted otherwise, rendering readability especially difficult.\n* Please consider another pass (possibly by a non-author reader) to avoid writing mistakes, which are not easily detectable by common software. The manuscript various such instances, for example \"international\" instead of \"interventional\" in the Related Work section. Or also cases of punctuation such as for example a missing dot between the two sentences at beginning of Section 4.\n* In the same way as for the regular text writing part, please careful check the mathematical notation. Similarly, there are also such instances where intentions don't comply with what is typeset, for example model $M$ instead of model $\\mathcal{M}$ in Lemma 3.3.\n* Avoid using notation in mathematical results if not needed, for example in Lemma 3.3. introducing $M$ is not necessary i.e., it is not being used by the result. For example rewrite as: \"Let $G$ denote the causal graph entailed by some SCM.\"\n* Please consider highlighting the two critical (and by the way rather strong) assumptions at the end Section 3.\n* Please consider doing another pass also with respect to captions and such. For example in your \"key contribution\" the algorithm in Alg.1. the label for \"causal graph\" is missing at the Input part.\n\n\nAs a final remark on the score: if the ICLR reviewing scale where a 1-10 scale, then I'd opt for a score of 3. However, I only get to choose between 1 and 3 this time around and since the identified issues with this work are severe based on this review's assessment, the conclusion is a 1. To not end this on a negative note, though, IMHO the potential for this work is good and would be of good value for the community."

I recommend looking at a evaluation with MorphoMNIST [2] (and cite the package).\nAdditionally, it would be nice to spell out the differences of this algorithm in case of no unobserved confounding.\n\n[1] Kevin Xia, Kai-Zhan Lee, Yoshua Bengio, and Elias Bareinboim.

                "value": "- It seems that most equations are written assuming discrete variables. Why is that?\n- Fig. 2 uses $Y_2$ while the text mentions $Y$ - is this a typo?\n- What does it mean for a digit to be thin or thick?\n- For the covid graph, in the real world wouldn't we assume an edge from C->N as well?\n- The evaluation generally could be more thorough. Things that could support this would be observational / interventional likelihoods or the evaluation that e.g. p(thickness) shouldn't change with a colour intervention.\n- Please have a look at the usage of \\citep vs \\citet."
