                "value": "The paper introduces a novel approach to out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) by leveraging minimal sufficient statistics within the encoder and decoder. This method differs from Morningstar et al. (2022) by focusing on the mean and variance of $q(z|x)$ instead of the posterior entropy and KL divergence for the latent variable $z$. Theoretical guarantee is derived by assuming there is essential separation between in distribution and OOD samples w.r.t. the $L_2$ norm, and the encoder/decoder in VAEs are Lipschitz. But in practice the assumptions are not always realistic. The experiment results are sometimes surpass SOTA and sometimes perform worse when the assumptions broke. \n1. **Proposed Methodology**:\n  - The paper suggests the utilization of the minimal sufficient statistics in both the encoder and decoder of the VAE for OOD detection.\n  - The work is reminiscent of Morningstar et al. (2022), but distinguishes itself by emphasizing the mean and variance of $q(z\u2223x)$ and derive theoretical guarantee of OOD under assumptions.\n2. **Assumptions and Implications**:\n  - Essential separation of in-distribution (ID) and OOD data based on L2 norm distance is assumed.\n  - The encoder and decoder must satisfy Lipschitz type conditions.\n  - Under these conditions, detection using reconstruction error or L2 norm distance in the latent space between a sample and ID samples is reliable with high probability.\n    - Practical implementation does not calculate distance by sampling IID samples. Instead, it is approximated using $\\mid || \\mu_{{z}}\\left({x}_{\\mathrm{OOD}}\\right) \\|-r_0 \\mid$.\n3. **Experimental Outcomes**:\n  - The method proves effective when the assumption on essential separation is likely met.\n  - On datasets with minor separations, like horizontally and vertically flipped variants, the technique is less effective compared to some state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."

If ID samples have a wide spread in $\u03bc(x_{IID})$ in the latent space, the absence of a singular reference point makes the approximation meaningless. The reliance on VAEs' regularization of the posterior on $z$ towards a Gaussian (typically zero mean) implies the technique may not be generalizable to other generative models with distinct latent variable regularization.\n\n- The assumptions for essential separation and Lipschitz conditions are too strong. The separation (defined by the $L_2$ norm)  may not hold for real world problems. The Lipschitz conditions are not enforced during training of VAEs (or in other generative models) as well.\n\n- The idea of using reconstruction error for OOD detection was proposed in [1]. It is worth discussing the difference and what are the new interpretations. \n\n- The paper's presentation quality needs improvements.\n    \n  - Some concepts are articulated in an imprecise, non-rigorous manner.

The authors suggest a dynamic path-wise likelihood integration method to capture the evolving nature of data distributions. \n\nThe paper asserts that this method more accurately differentiates between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples by considering the trajectory of the likelihood as data moves from ID to OOD. To substantiate their claims, the authors provide experimental results that demonstrate an improvement over existing methods such as ODIN across several benchmarks.
