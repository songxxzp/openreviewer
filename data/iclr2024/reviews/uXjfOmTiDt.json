To achieve this, EAD develops two central recurrent sub-modules, i.e., a perception module and a policy module, to implement two critical functions of active vision. These models recurrently process a series of beliefs and observations, facilitating progressive refinement of their comprehension of the target object and enabling the development of strategic actions to counter adversarial patches in 3D environments."

EAD training is a two stage learning approach performed in a dynamic environment (i.e. the generative space of faces using EG3D or CARLA simulation)  - 1) training the perceptual model for the specific task (for eg face recognition or object detection) using random policy 2) co-training the perception module along with the policy.

The authors implement embodied perception as a partially observable markov decision process. The overall system comprises of two new models: a perception model and a policy model. The perception model maintains an 'understanding' of the scene which it progressively updates based on new observations. The policy model dictates a transition process that is focused on improving the quality of observations to improve recognition. Given an initial observation, the system progressively refines its belief using the perception and policy models. Through two visual recognition tasks: face recognition and object detection, authors demonstrate the effectiveness of emodied perception based defense to not only improve robustness against seen and unseen attacks, but also improve standard performance."
