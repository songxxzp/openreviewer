The paper is filled with undefined notations without further explanations, which makes the formulas unreadable and the main idea hard to follow. It would be great if the authors could provide a notation table. Some examples are listed below.\n\n(1) U in Eq. (1).\n\n(2) d in Eq. (4).\n\n(3) M in the second paragraph of section 2.2.\n\n2. There are lots of minor problems and the paper should be checked and organized in a better way to make the paper easier to read.\n\n(1) There are many citations that do not form a part of a sentence but appear in the format style of \"Name (year)\". The names outside the brackets reduce the readability of the sentence. For example, on the 10th line below Eq. (1), Roy et al. should be put inside the brackets.\n\n(2) On pages 1 and 2, the space between paragraphs is the same as that between lines in the same paragraph.\n\n(3) There are many typos and grammar mistakes that can be easily detected by spelling and grammar software. For example, on the 18th line below Eq. (2), \"i.e\" should be \"i.e.\". On the line above Eq. (4), \"stabiity\" should be \"stability\". The period at the end of Eq. (4) should be a comma since the sentence is not finished. There is a redundant period on the 5th line in Definition 1.\n\n(4) The section citations are peculiar. In the last paragraph of section 1, \"section2\" should be \"section 2\".\n\n3. The learning process (learning dynamics from chaotic systems) and the learning algorithm (OS-net) are not clearly demonstrated. From the aspect of machine learning, it would be better to formulate the learning process by defining the input, output, and target. Meanwhile, it seems that the \"chaotic\" property does not appear in a formal definition. For the learning algorithm, it would be better to present the algorithm step by step in an algorithm block.\n\n4. There exist minor mathematical errors. In the first paragraph of section 2.2, the authors claim that increasing functions have positive derivatives. This is wrong by considering $f(x) = x^3$. Activation functions used in the paper ($x + \\sin x$ and $x + \\frac{1}{a} \\sin^2 (ax)$) are also increasing but have zero derivatives at some points."

What are the specific works that focus on stability of dynamic systems, and what are the shortcomings of these related works compared to the method proposed in this paper?\n\nW2. The authors claim that they have proposed a family of neural network architectures, but they only proved and experimented with a shallow network featuring a single hidden layer. How can they generalize the proof of the regularization strategy for Matrix J to other forms of neural networks in this family as mentioned in the paper?\n\nW3. I think the explanation of the experimental metrics and the analysis of the results are not detailed enough. For example, how should we evaluate that the results of OS-net shown in the Figures 3, 6, and 8 are better?\n\nW4. I do not agree with the way the authors presented their experimental results. They only present the results of their own method without comparing it to baseline methods to highlight the stability of OS-net.

In [1] it is clearly stated that the goal is to detect unstable periodic orbits of a dynamical system. From figure 2, I deduce that the training data is the unstable 1-period solution of the Rossler for c=6. Thus, the OS-net is using the unstable 1-period solution itself to learn an ODE that has stable dynamics converging to such 1-period solution. If that is right, then the contribution of the paper looks poor because it is detecting an already detected orbit. I strongly suggest the authors to state in a much clearer way what is the goal, and the detailed experimental procedure. \n\nTherefore, I\u2019m led to assume that the contribution of the paper is to stably track unstable solutions present in the chaotic regime, as for the case of Rossler with c=18. However, if the training data was from t=0 to t=10, then it is not fair to claim that the OS-net learned the periodic solution from the chaotic trajectory, because the trajectory starts to deviate from the periodic motion only for t>30. I guess the OS-net converges to this periodic solution just because the transient of the trajectory used as training data was looking periodic. Would the OS-net work well in reproducing an 8-period solution of the Rossler in the chaotic regime? If the system quickly starts to wander erratically, then there is not enough time in the training data to explore the 8-period solution, then what the OS-net would learn? \n\nOverall, the experimental setting seems to reduce to the learning of an ODE whose dynamics converge to a periodic solution that coincides with the trajectory provided as input. In conclusion, the experiments are not well devised to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, and so the contribution and impact of the paper is blurred. \n\n[1] Bramburger, Jason J., J.
