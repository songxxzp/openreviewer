The trained particle masks are combined in the weighted average fashion to get the single mask of a given pruning iteration.

                "value": "- The study's reliance on demonstrating the process primarily through wide networks such as WRN and VGG-19, which are not the most parameter-efficient architectures, raises questions about the choice of models. An explanation of why these particular, potentially less efficient, models were selected for this research is needed.\n\n- The improvement in accuracy provided by SWAMP over IMP is modest, as shown in Tables 2 and 3, and this increment is even less pronounced for the ResNet model as evidenced in Table 3. This calls for a discussion on the significance of the marginal gains achieved by SWAMP, particularly when benchmarked against other models.\n\n- The feasibility of achieving an optimal sparse structure with SWAMP, especially for pre-trained models which are commonplace, may entail significant computational costs. It is imperative that the authors address the computational overhead, both in terms of space and time complexity, and the practical constraints when applied to large models, including Transformers. A comprehensive discussion on the limitations is warranted, given that IMP\u2014the foundation of SWAMP\u2014may have its own constraints with larger models.\n\n- The applicability of the proposed method to architectures like Transformers needs clarification. In Table 8, the RoBERTa model exhibits a noticeable performance drop even with less than 50% sparsity. The question arises as to whether this decline is attributed to the inherent limitations of IMP, on which SWAMP is based, or if it pertains to the broader challenges of applying pruning techniques to RoBERTa. Additionally, it would be beneficial to understand whether the principles behind SWAMP remain valid for other models, such as GPT-like architectures, and how they compare with alternative pruning strategies for these models."
