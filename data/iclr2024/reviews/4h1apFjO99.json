The method involves an interpretable decomposition into trend and seasonality components. The diffusion model is trained using a joint L2 and Fourier loss, and the authors apply conditional generation techniques to apply the method to forecasting and imputation directly without changes in the model. Experiments show Diffusion-TS achieves state-of-the-art performance on time series datasets, including in an irregularly sampled setting."

A variety of datasets and evaluation metrics are used for standard unconditional generation, and several ablation studies are included in the appendix.\n- The authors show qualitative results showing the trend and seasonality components predicted by the model generally behave as intended.\n\nClarity:\n- The paper is generally well-written, and the experiments are described clearly.\n\nSignificance:\n- The experimental results are quite compelling. In the unconditional time series generation settings (Table 1), Diffusion-TS outperforms existing methods. The performance gap is especially clear for higher-dimensional datasets and long-term generation (Table 2)."

For example, in Figure 3, the trend components seem quite uninformative compared to the season/error components. In Figure 4, it's unclear whether the t-SNE visualizations support the claim that the Diffusion-TS distribution better aligns with the data distribution than TimeGAN distribution.\n- Experimental metrics reported are inconsistent. For example, correlational and context-FID scores are reported in Table 2, and discriminative and predictive scores are reported in Figure 7 and Appendix C.1/C.2."

Is this equivalent to $x_0(x_t, t, \\theta) = R$ in Eqn 7, setting the $V_{tr}^t$ and $S_{i, t}$ terms to $0$? How crucial are the polynomial regressor and Fourier synthetic layer techniques?\n- How well does the trend-seasonality decomposition method of Diffusion-TS achieve what's intended for the toy model (Eqn 1), for example on synthetic data?\n- How do discriminative and predictive scores compare on the long-term time series generation task (Table 2)?\n- For the long-term generation task (Table 2), why is it that Diffusion-TS seems to perform generally better with longer time series? It seems like longer time series generation should be a more difficult task.\n- In Figure 6, is MAE computed only over missing data (imputation targets) or over the full time series including existing data? For Diffusion-TS-G, since a soft constraint is used to enforce the conditional generation, how closely do the generated time series for imputation/forecasting match the existing data?\n- How does the number of parameters compare between Diffusion-TS and its competitors?\n\nClarifications:\n- How is the data in Figure 3 generated? Is column b the ground truth and column a the result of adding noise?"

[2] proposes a self-guidance mechanism to use unconditional diffusion models for conditional time series tasks and also studies the unconditional generative properties of the model. This limits the novelty of the paper and Sec. 3.4, in particular.\n- The paper is poorly written and does not tell a coherent story. Sec. 3.2 reads like an arbitrary combination of ideas. The individual components are also not analyzed later via ablations. The manuscript also has many typographical errors (synthetic instead of synthesis, DSDI instead of CSDI).\n- The evaluation on the conditional tasks is limited. The model is only compared against Diffwave and CSDI (which is fairly close to Diffwave) and baselines from time series forecasting literature are missing. It is also unclear how these CSDI and Diffwave baselines were trained. \n\n\n\n[1] Lim, Haksoo, et al. \"Regular Time-series Generation using SGM.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.08518 (2023).      \n[2] Kollovieh, Marcel, et al. \"Predict, refine, synthesize: Self-guiding diffusion models for probabilistic time series forecasting.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.11494 (2023)."
