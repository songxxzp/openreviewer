A new approach was proposed to optimize both the approximate solution and random samples in the training set by using a min max formulation. This approach is called adversarial adaptive sampling (AAS). The main idea of AAS is minimizing the residuals and meanwhile push the residual-induced distribution to a uniform one.  AAS can be divided into two parts. In the maximization part, the deep generative model helps define the difference between the residual-induced distribution and a uniform one using Wasserstein distance. In the minimization one, this difference is minimized together with the residuals.   Also, they used some benchmark test problems of comparison AAS algorithm with another state-of-the-art algorithms as DAS and RAR."

The authors operationalize this using a WGAN setup, wherein they train a pushforward map to learn p(x), such the wasserstein-1 loss between the the density of the residual and uniform distribution. This is similar in vein of the adaptive sampling techniques introduced in Gao et al (2023) but the weights are instead learned using a GAN type architecture."

Specifically, the collocation points for training the PINN are sampled from a normalizing flow with soft Lipschitz constraint, enforced by Sobolev regularization. The PINNs and normalizing flows are optimized in an alternating fashion, where the normalizing flow is trained to maximize the expected PINN residual (w.r.t. to the distribution given by the pushforward of the normalizing flow). This formulation is then connected to the dual form of an optimal transport problem. In this context, it is shown that there exists an optimal solution to the proposed min-max problem where the (normalized) squared residual converges to a uniform distribution in the Wasserstein distance. The approach's effectiveness is further demonstrated on two toy problems and one high-dimensional nonlinear PDE and compared to three related methods."
