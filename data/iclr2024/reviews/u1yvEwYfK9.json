                "value": "This paper considers test-agnostic long-tailed recognition, where the training distribution is long-tailed and the test distribution can be different from the training distribution, not necessarily uniform but unknown. Based on the theoretical results showing that if one can estimate the test label distribution, it can be possibly used to reduce generalization error even with the distribution shift during training and test time, this paper proposes a label shift correction (LSC) method. LSC estimates the test label distribution using the trained neural estimator and the predicted logits for test data using the pre-trained model. The neural estimator is trained to minimize the distance between the estimated distribution using the logit output of the pre-trained model and the true label distribution, for various label distributions generated by sampling training data while varying class priors. Also, the adaptive logit clipping is introduced to clipping spurious model outputs. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on CIFAR-10/100-LT and ImageNet-LT and also show that the proposed method can be combined with existing LT method to further boost the performance."

(2) What does $g_{\\theta}$ refer to in your experiments? Is $g_{\\theta}$ equal to NeuralEstimator? (3) Since the training dataset is imbalanced, how can you sample a subset of the training dataset when its smallest class should be the biggest class in the subset?\n\n2. **[The highlight of the proposed method is not clear.]** The goal of LSC is to find an estimator $g$ that aligns the predicted test label distribution with the true. But in Line 7 of the pseudo-code, $g_{\\theta}$ aims to align subset label distribution with the prior global label distribution on the training dataset. So can you explain which step achieves this goal?\n\n3. **[Your theoretical analysis cannot explain why your proposed method can align the discrepancy between the predicted and the true test label distributions.]** You have mentioned two theorems in your paper. However, both of them only certify that a smaller gap between predicted and the true test label distributions leads to a lower generalization error.
