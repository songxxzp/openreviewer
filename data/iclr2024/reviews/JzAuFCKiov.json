Experiments are full LM fine-tuning is conducted. \n\nOverall, I feel this paper studied an interesting and important problem. However, this paper is not very well-written. It is very hard to get the key contribution and understand where the benefit is coming from. The authors made a lot of comparisons: absolute feedback v.s. relative feedback; trajectory-wise v.s. token-wise; MDP v.s. CB,  but without giving a direct correlation with the proposed algorithm. \n\nThe algorithm seems to follow the standard approach: learn a reward model first, and then optimize the reward model using some optimizations. It is unclear how significant to replace PPO by PG. In practice, the more important question is the reward model is not good enough. \n\nDo you still need to train a reward model first? I think it is helpful to write down the pseudo-code. If so, comparing with DPO is not fair. The main benefit of PPO is to avoid the expensive separate reward modeling + RL optimization steps.  \n\nIn DPO paper, the SFT baseline is trained on the preferred response of the preference feedback dataset. In the current work, the SFT baseline is not further trained on the preference feedback dataset. I hope the author can reproduce the result in DPO paper such that we can make sure the implementation is current."

For example, given the same reward function learned from the dataset, it would also be good to compare with RAFT, since it is also a very simple algorithm for policy improvement. \n\n- What if we apply the same clip trick for DPO? Will DPO also achieve similar performance with P3O? \n\n- If I understand correctly, the algorithm design is based on the assumption that we can sum over $y$: $\\sum_y r(y)\\pi(y)$ to obtain a constant baseline w.r.t y. But in practice, especially for the latter algorithm design, we only have one sample estimation for the summation. This could be problematic since y is a piece of sentence (tokens. or discrete variables), usually we might need large samples to obtain such an unbiased estimation, will this cause a problem for gradient estimation?"

Relative feedback: As the relative feedback is derived from the difference in rewards (as shown in Figure 1), it implies access to the rewards. First, it is not clear in which scenarios one can access the true rewards in LLMs. Second, it is unclear why not directly train the RL model using the available rewards.
