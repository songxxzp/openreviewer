The paper repeatedly emphasizes that the MDP framework can be reinterpreted as a controllable dynamical system. However, this assertion is widely acknowledged and lacks the novelty; therefore, continually highlighting it does not contribute significantly to the paper's academic value.\n\n3. The paper is marred by poor writing and grammatical errors, an issue that is evident in sentences like, \"One key property of a trajectory which a paramount to dynamical systems theory is it\u2019s stability.\" Additionally, the results presented in Figure 5 are convoluted, suggesting that the author needs to refine their writing and data presentation skills.\n\n4. The proposed method of \"constraining all system states in the reward function\" is perplexing. The paper fails to articulate the intuition and logic behind this approach, making it difficult for readers to comprehend its purpose and effectiveness.\n\n5. There is a conspicuous absence of discussion concerning the existing body of research on the stability of reinforcement learning (RL) policies. The author neglects to reference any prior studies in this area, indicating a need for more comprehensive literature review and research on the topic."

To solve this issue, the authors propose to redesign the reward function such that it counts all the system states. Experiment study shows that such modification reduces the MLE but sacrifices the agent performance."

In addition, under the definition of sensitivity in this paper (Definition 1), a system seems very easy to be sensitive to since $\\beta$ is only assumed to be positive (can be arbitrarily close to zero), and they only require there exist a time step $k$ such that $\\| ^k u(s) - ^k u(\\hat{s}) \\| > \\beta$. \n\nThe modification of the reward function (2) is weak to me. In order to obtain reference value $\\bar{s}$, one has to run the standard problem first, this is rather inefficient. I believe such a method is not practical."

However, *it is not clear whether stability, in the way it is defined in the paper, is actually a desirable characteristic of RL policies*. \n\nAs a concrete example, let us consider walker stand. In the default version of the environment, the system state include features such as the agent's angle of the foot joint. which is not used the the reward function (reward is only dependent on torso height and angle). As a result, RL policies, given different initial conditions, may control the agent to position its foot joint in different angles while maintaining a standing position. This behavior will lead to consistently high reward across different initial conditions, while yielding a low stability score (as defined by the Maximal Lyapunov Exponent), because the stability score will punish the policy for putting the agent's foot at different angles in different trajectories. Moreover, the paper's proposed method of modifying the reward function will minimize this behavior by incentivizing the policy to always put the agent's foot in the same angle, which will lead to a higher stability score. However, it is not clear that this \"stable\" behavior is actually desirable. In the example of walker stand, the angle of the foot joint is not part of the reward function, because it *doesn't matter* for the performance of the task. In the current results in the paper, improving stability via the modified reward function does not consistently lead to better performance (in terms of the reward), so it is not clear why measuring and improving stability is meaningful or significant."
