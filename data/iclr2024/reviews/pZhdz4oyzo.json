                "value": "In this article, the authors propose to address the memory footprint of LLMs. They argue that this represents the main challenge for efficient inference of such models. This claim is well-supported by previous literature in the field. To do so, they propose to combine two main elements: sparse encoding of outliers and hessian-based clustering. The presence of outliers is a well-known challenge regarding LLM quantization. These weights are challenging to encode. Instead of occupying values within the non-uniform quantization codebook. The author decompose the weight tensor in two: a small size (less than 1% of the total) is dedicated to said outliers in high precision and the remainder of the weight values are encoded in a low size LUT. Furthermore, in order to improve the performance of the LUT clustering, the authors propose to adapt the k-means algorithm to the specificity of the weight tensors of a trained model: all weight values are not trained equal. The hessian of the weight values is leveraged as an estimate to weight each weights contribution. \nThe resulting method achieves remarkable results on a variety of challenging benchmarks."

                "value": "Regarding the two approaches, there needs to be more discussion on prior works.\nK-means clustering for Quantization is a popular technique used in signal processing. For neural networks, works such as DeepCompression [Han et al., ICLR 2016], SLQ/MLQ [Xu et al., AAAI 2018], HPTQ [Xu et al., IEEE Signal Processing Letters 2023] employ k-means clustering for quantization. It would be great to acknowledge such and similar works in literature and compare them to justify the novelty claimed in Sec 4.1. Of course, LLMs as a target application is new, but the technique may need to be more novel in its current presentation.\n\nA similar treatment is observed in Dense and Spare Decomposition (Sec 4.2), where similar techniques exist in the literature, not necessarily for LLMs.  The author must acknowledge and discuss the prior works, such as DSD [Han et al., ICLR 2017], Scatterbrain [Chen et al., NeurIPS 2021], Vitality [Dass et al., HPCA 2023], etc to bring out the novelty.\n\nOverall, it seems the LLMs provide opportunities to employ a novel combination of existing techniques. If so, the current presentation of Sec 4 does not paint an accurate picture and needs to be rewritten to acknowledge similar works and present the novelty. In addition, discussing SmoothQuant [Xiao et al., arXiv 2022, ICML 2023] in the context of post-training quantization for LLMs might be worthwhile."

I'd recommend adhering to the ICLR latex format for consistency.\nI noticed references to non-uniform quantization, specifically (Chung, 2020) and (Jeon, 2022), in the appendix. These papers employ non-uniform quantization as a structured extension of binary quantization. This differs from the clustering-based vector quantization used in your paper.\n\n*Implementation and Kernel Concerns:*\nI have reservations about the kernel implementation. Introducing such custom kernel, as described in your method, appears to disrupt the established high-performance computing framework. Although an unstructured or non-uniform structure might enhance model performance, it could also negatively impact acceleration performance or complicate it. Hence, a more detailed exposition about the kernel is essential to substantiate the novelty of your method. While your results indicate an improved model performance, the absence of a dedicated kernel might undermine its effectiveness. Additionally, it's worth pondering why there was no effort to implement and optimize the kernel specifically for the A100. Even though the A100/H100 might be a costly choice, they can serve as a foundational hardware for large language models, particularly in tandem with NVIDIA's inference software. It's noteworthy that the memory bandwidth for the RTX series is below 1TB/s.\n\n*Feedback on Model Performance:*\nThe majority of the model performance results focus on PPL outcomes. I believe it would be beneficial to include MMLU or CSR results for larger models within the main content, rather than relegating it to the appendix.\n\nIn conclusion, due to the aforementioned concerns, I am inclined to assign a score of 5 to this paper. While I perceive this paper as integrating various methodologies, I will defer to other reviewers for their viewpoints on this aspect."
