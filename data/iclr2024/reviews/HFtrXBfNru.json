Based on a few assumptions, the authors theoretically establish that such distortion is strictly increasing over time with a lower bound. Furthermore, based on the pre-trained GNN and an RNN that performs temporal generalization estimation, the authors propose a solution that incorporates an adaptive feature extractor that operates through self-supervised graph reconstruction, aiming to estimate and adjust for the distortion. Under a synthetic random graph setting,  a closed-form generalization error is also derived. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of substantially improving estimation accuracy and generalization ability."

Then, the authors have proposed SMART that contains contrastive graph construction. The augmented feature graphs is randomly adding or dropping edges, and then structure reconstruction loss and feature reconstruction loss are used on the contrasted examples. The authors have verified the effectiveness of SMART on the barabasi-albert random graph, and performed extensive experiments to showcase SMART's effectiveness with evolving graphs."

There should at least some experiments and measurements that connect information loss to contrastive learning post deployment, and to show that SMART is able to reduce the information loss induced by representation distortion. A theoretical justification is also fine.\n\nW3. The data augmentation in graph is too naive. The authors have only considered to randomly add or drop edges, which should only work for graphs without edge labels. While the random data augmentation technique works for barabasi-albert random graphs, it should not be effective for the cases where edge labels are also changing (for example, people change their relationship status with other people).

Do the authors expect the proposed method to work on heterophilus graphs as well? \n\n- The writing could be improved.

                "value": "This study investigates the representation distortion of graphs during evolution. The authors proposed SMART to estimate the temporal generalization performance of GNN. The authors provided theoretical proofs as well as numerical experiments, showing the distortion of representation is inevitable and providing a way of estimating generalization loss."

The authors theoretically establish a lower bound and conducted various numerical experiments using both synthetic datasets and real world datasets. Introduction is straightforward. The results seem promising. The ablation study is convincing and sufficient."

                "value": "Figure 1 is a bit confusing: what\u2019s the x axis? And what are the nodes at each year?\n\nFor the information loss, the authors considered the loss from RNN as well as from representation distortion. Can the authors comment on the loss of information from graphs to their low dimensional representations and their effects on the model.\n\nMore evaluation metrics besides MAPE should be considered for the synthetic datasets.\n\nInterestingly GCN seems achieved the best performance in the three compared GNNs, can the authors comment on the contribution of different GNN structures to the performance?"
