It extends traditional logits with the multi-step discounted cumulative reward and the logits of future states. It is shown that tree expansion helps reduce gradient variance. The variance decays exponentially with the planning horizon, and the closer the induced transitions are to being state-independent, the faster the decay. With approximate forward models, the resulting gradient bias diminishes with the approximation error while retaining the same variance decay. SoftTreeMax reduces the gradient variance by three orders of magnitude in Atari, leading to better sample complexity and improved performance compared to distributed PPO."

The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with most claims being well-discussed within the paper.

This makes it difficult to determine the extent of SoftTreeMax's improvement over existing methods.\n\nAdditionally, the paper lacks in-depth comparison with other related methods. While the paper compares SoftTreeMax with distributed PPO, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in the field.

There have been many efforts to reduce the variance and improve sample complexity for policy gradient methods (e.g., including a baseline). It is therefore better to also compare state-of-the-art approaches that also solve the same problem.\n\n> We do so by sub-sampling only the most promising branches at each level. Limiting the width drastically improves runtime, and enables respecting GPU memory limits, with only a small sacrifice in performance.\n\nDoesn\u2019t this also introduce additional variance by sub-sampling and pruning?\n\n>  For depths $d \\geq 3$, we limited the tree to a maximum width of 1024 nodes and pruned trajectories with low estimated weights.\n\nDoes it suffer from a limitation when used with a larger value of $d$, which may lead to a more significant limitation of the allowed maximum width considering costs?\n\n> Figure 3: Reward and Gradient variance: GPU SoftTreeMax (single worker) vs PPO (256 GPU workers).\n\nDoes it perform more sample-efficient than baseline methods (not compared in terms of final performance or actual wall-clock time)?"

Although authors mention that formally proving the conjectured global convergence with fast rate as in (Mei et al 2020b) is subject to future work. It is hard to demonstrate its advantage over the traditional SoftMax policy gradient, or more generally traditional policy gradient methods without comparing the sample complexity between SoftTreeMax policy gradient and traditional SoftMax policy gradient. The main missing piece is that the reduction in variance does not necessarily imply the faster convergence of smaller sample complexity if bringing such variance reduction needs to use a form of policy gradient sacrifice the performance in the deterministic setting (For example, I am not sure whether the proposed SoftTreeMax policy gradient will even converge in the derterministic setting).\n\n3. There are some relevant papers that address related problems that authors may need to add to the related work.\n\n(1) Optimization Methods for Interpretable Differentiable Decision Trees in Reinforcement Learning, Andrew Silva, et al,. 2020 AISTATS.\n\n(2) On the Global Optimum Convergence of Momentum-based Policy Gradient, Yuhao Ding, et al, 2022 AISTATS. \n\nIt is important to compare with (1) to evaluate whether this paper is still the first work on proposing a differentiable parametric policy that combines tree expansion with PG. (2) also studies the convergence and the variance reduction for softmax PG."
