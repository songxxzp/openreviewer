I highly recommend the authors perform supplemental numerics where these parameter counts are brought in line to control for this behavior. It is also unclear to me whether there is actually any theoretical quantum advantage when the quantum model has no auxiliary qubits as arXiv:2211.16998 gives efficient classical simulation algorithms for permutation-invariant quantum systems and machine learning models. This might limit the utility of the introduced quantum model to the case where there are many auxiliary qubits, which then runs into problematic training behavior as the authors point out.\n\nA much more minor point, but there are also many typos: \"and yielding\" at the bottom of page 3, \"expressivity power\" in the abstract, \"guarantee to distinguish\" in the abstract, and \"TorchQauntum\" at the bottom of page 7 are some that I found."

Also, the $R_{zz}$ is symmetric with respect to the two qubits it acts on, so there is no difference between choosing which is the target and which is the control qubit.\n- Typo in the sentence \"the identical parameteric gates are acted when the order of input nodes.\"\n- Typo in the sentence \"We now study the effect of width of the circuit increased\"\n\nQuestions:\n- It is not clear to me why there are instances of MILP that cannot be distinguished by GNNs, as in Figure 2. While the vertex degrees are the same, the connectivity is different, so shouldn't GNNs treat them differently? Perhaps I am missing something about how standard GNNs deal with this problem in the context of MILP.\n- Why choose $R_{zz}$ over other two-qubit gates that commute with itself such as $R_{xx}$ or $R_{yy}$? This goes back to the weakness of the circuit construction not being well motivated.\n- In the feature encoding layer, is there any reason why $R_x(c_i)$ and $R_x(u_i)$ as well as $R_x(l_i)$ and $R_x(\\epsilon_i)$, are applied to different qubits?\n- Out of curiosity, how the MILP instances are generated to be foldable or unfoldable? I suppose this requires something like solving the graph isomorphism problem.\n- When predicting the solution vector, what is the actual representation of the classical information after reading out the qubits? For example, does a 2-qubit state for $v_1$ correspond to integers 0,1,2,3? Also, what happens when reading out a result that does not satisfy the constraints?"
