The authors propose the incorporation of a smart splitter and a smart sub-search-space sampler to allocate parts of the search space and reduce overall GPU resource consumption. Combined with optimizers like TPE, along with the gradient descent-based one-shot algorithm DARTS, the authors aim to facilitate a coordinated optimization of hyperparameters and neural architectures.

So, any approach solving this problem convincingly (i.e., getting the best of both worlds) would be a significant contribution to AutoML. In a sense, this also implies that there is quite some novelty by combining existing ideas and trying to come up with something superior. \n\nAlthough there are possible improvements regarding clarity (see weaknesses), overall the approach is well motivated and Algorithm 1 explains the major idea well. \n\nQuality is unfortunately lacking and is further discussed under weaknesses."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "### Significance and Originality\n\nMy biggest problem is that the disadvantages of multi-trial and one-shot algorithms discussed at the beginning of the paper, e.g., instability of DARTS and many trainings of multi-trial approaches, but overall, these are retained in the Hyperion algorithm. Although Hyperion shows some strong performance, I wondered whether it actually it is not the best of both worlds but also the worst of both worlds. \n\n### Clarity\n\nThe writing style of the paper lacks clarity. Although the main motivation is clear, a full understanding and how all the components play together was only fully understandable on Page 6. That\u2019s too late and makes it hard to read the paper. The main problem might lie in the emphasis on gradient-based approaches, which don\u2019t need to restart training from scratch all the time. Therefore, I expected that Hyperion would also have this property. That this is not the case, but only for the inner DARTS loop, was only clear to me on Page 6.  \n\nIt also confused me that the authors jump between hyperparameters and parameters. In fact, I believe that they sometimes call hyperparameters parameters. This needs careful consideration again. \n\nAnother problem is the multi-objective statement. In fact, the authors say that they do multi-objective optimization, but in the end it is only an apriori scalarization of two objectives; this boils it down to single objective. Real multi-objective with Pareto Fronts and so on is never happening.\n\nFurther problems in clarity are shown by my rather long list of questions (see below).\n\n### Quality of Experiments\n\nThe experiments overall are a major problem. I have several major concerns.\nThe experiments in Figure 4 are evaluated using varying metrics and, therefore, lack comparability. The reasoning behind this is not explained. \n\nThe datasets are rather old and small \u2013 not necessarily problematic. But for MNIST, CIFAR10 and co state of the art is very strong and well known. Because of the obscure metrics, it is unclear whether they achieved state-of-the-art on these datasets. If not, I strongly wonder about the significance of the results.\n\nFurthermore, it is not clear whether the performance gains are significant or not. E.g., on MNIST, the improvement is 0.001. In addition, Figure 4 lacks uncertainty (e.g., standard deviations across repeated experiments); so we don\u2019t know whether these results are by chance. \n\nI also wondered why MNIST got 72h runtime, while FASHION-MNIST, EuroSAT and Motor only got 20h each. MNIST is the most trivial vision dataset and it is very trivial to get SOTA performance on it with much less time. In general, I would be interested to see how the approaches compare over time (as shown in nearly all AutoML papers).\n\nThere is no comparison against current state-of-the-art AutoML approaches. TPE is fairly old and outdated. I would expect at the very least a comparison against multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization since it also partially solves the problem of training the DNN always full and thus is somehow inbetween black-box multi-trial (i.e., many full trainings) and gradient-based NAS (i.e., a single full training). This is in particular important since Auto-PyTorch (using BOHB) already showed that it outperforms multi-trial black box optimization and gradient-based DARTS.\n\nLast but not least, the motor dataset puzzles me. I don\u2019t know why this dataset was considered in this paper and whether this is somewhere publicly available for reproducibility reasons. \n\n### Related Work\n\nIn fact, addressing joint HPO and NAS is not new. The novelty only comes from combining DARTS and multi-trial HPO. Previously published papers on joint HPO and NAS are not discussed in the paper and are not compared against. For example, JAHS or Auto-PyTorch. \n\n### Minor comments\n\n* The claim that Bayesian optimization methods learn optimized sub-search spaces is incorrect (Section 3.2).\n* Despite it being mentioned in Section 4.2, there is no justification in the appendix about the motor dataset in combination with DARTS.\n* I would not call Section 4.5 an ablation study. It is not ablating any component of Hyperion. Nevertheless, it is a valuable subsection."

The term usually refers to training a model.\n* Why are the hyperparameters defining data preprocessing, etc., in Section 4.1 fixed, and to what values? The introduction implies that tuning these would be a contribution of the paper.\n* Is there a way to quantify the uncertainty in the experiments in Section 4.2? Could noise level and variance be provided? Were multiple experiments run in this setting? Are the results on CIFAR10 statistically significant?\n* Are the results in Figure 5 b and c statistically significant? \n* Could the authors elaborate on the scalability of Hyperion when dealing with larger datasets or more complex architectures? The runtimes for the baseline datasets seem rather long. The search spaces evaluated in the experiments are very limited in their size.\n* Section 4.5 .

The authors discuss related work on joint NAS and HPO, but do not compare to any of it.\n\n2. There is no motivation of using other metrics than top-1 accuracy in this particular experimental setup:\n    - Creating a custom metric that combines number of parameters and accuracy gives DARTS an unfair disadvantage. In that case a comparison to a method optimizing for such a metric should be considered instead [1].\n    - The authors claim that the optimization metric for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and EuroSAT is accuracy. This is clearly not the case as can be seen in Figure 4 and 5.\n    - It is not possible to compare the reported results to other reported numbers out there since we in most cases do not have any idea what the top-1 accuracy is.\n\n3. The authors claim savings in GPU memory. They do not demonstrate these benefits by, e.g., training on ImageNet, nor do they discuss other works that overcame this shortcoming of DARTS already [1].\n\n4. Unclear whether the results are statistically significant: Figure 5 implies no significance. Can you provide the standard deviation for Figure 4?\n\n5. Search budget seems very high for all datasets: Why is the search budget for MNIST 72 GPU hours? Training a simple 2 layer CNN will reach the same performance in just 5 minutes. What is the search time for each method? I doubt that DARTS really needs 72 hours.\n\nNot related to the evaluation, but certainly also a small weakness is the fact that the system is rather complex. I wonder how many hyperparameters you have to set and how sensitive your system is to that.\n\nConcluding, my main concerns are choice of baselines, metrics, statistical significance, and choice of search time. Right now, I am leaning more towards rejection, but there are many open questions that I would like the authors to address.\n\nThanks for your efforts!\n\n[1] Han Cai, Ligeng Zhu, Song Han: ProxylessNAS: Direct Neural Architecture Search on Target Task and Hardware.

Firstly, the proposed approach was also used in AutoHAS [1] (or earlier versions of the paper) and similar to it Hyperion still seems to struggle with the computational costs required for search (72 hours search on MNIST). \n\n- The partitioning of the full search space into sub-spaces is not novel in the NAS community, even though it seems a reasonable approach to reduce the memory footprint during search in Hyperion. Some examples (that I think should also be mentioned in the related work) are LaMCTS [2], that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to learn partitions of NAS search spaces and more closely related, Few-shot NAS [3] that splits the one-shot network to sub-one-shot networks.\n\n- Another recent and probably the most relevant work is DHA [4], which efficiently jointly optimizes the data augmentation policy, hyperparameters and architecture.\n\n**Empirical evaluation**\n\n- The baselines that the authors picked in their experiments are not the strongest. Firstly, there are many one-shot NAS methods that have much lower memory footprint compared to DARTS (e.g. PC-DARTS [5]), and comparing to them should be fairer.\n\n- The benchmarks the authors picked for their experiments are way too trivial. CIFAR-10 is of course a standard benchmark in NAS, however running on that only, and more trivial ones as MNIST, is not sufficient to claim the conclusions the authors state.\n\n- The runtime of Hyperion seems still to be non-negligible. It requires 96 h on CIFAR-10 and 72 h on MNIST and this is way too much time in practice if a practitioner would need to run Hyperion on every new benchmark. \n\n- A comparison to existing joint NAS and HPO algorithms such as DHA [4] and the one from Zela et al. (2018) [6] is lacking.\n\n**Clarity**\n\n- I found it difficult to follow the description of various algorithmic components in section 3.4, which goes along with Algorithm 1. It would be great if the authors would provide a higher-level description of the algorithm in the main paper and move the details to the appendix.  \n\n**Reproducibility**\n\n- I wasn't able to find the code, so this hampers the reproducibility.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03656\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00708.pdf\n\n[3] http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/zhao21d/zhao21d.pdf\n\n[4] https://openreview.net/pdf?id=MHOAEiTlen\n\n[5] https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05737\n\n[6] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06906.pdf"

This paper aims to jointly optimize both, and can potentially lead to better results.\n2. Intuitive ideas.  This paper is not the first to jointly optimize network and hyper-parameters, but in general, this is an unsolved and difficult challenge, because they naturally require different approaches to optimize. The idea proposed in this paper is to combine both multi-trial and gradient decent, which is a good direction to explore.\n3."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The results are quite limited.  Most of datasets are tiny: MNIST, CIFAR, Fashion-MNIST.  Because those datasets are too small, you may have a risk of overfitting to the dataset, while jointly optimizing hyper-parameters and networks. It is also difficult to justify if the proposed method can generalize to large datasets, such as ImageNet, COCO, etc.\n\n2. The method is a bit over complicated.  Because it combines multi-trial and gradient decent, it is somewhat expected that the method will be complicated. Looking at Algorithm 1, it has quite many steps with different optimizers, making the algorithm not easy to understand. \n\n3. Search space is quite limited. For example, learning rate only has two values in Table 1. Not sure if the method can apply to larger search space."

                "value": "1. Could you add more datasets, such as ImageNet and COCO?\n2. Could you explain how would you handle continuous hyper-parameters? For example, people often search for a learning rate value between 1e-3 to 1e-5, but the range is continuous rather than discrete. How would you handle that?\n3. Could you try some experiments with a larger search space?"
