This makes the neat \u201cArtiHippo\u201d based algorithm a bit over-complicated and more engineering-driven.\n3.\tIt seems all methods always use pre-trained strong ViT backbone for incremental tasks. This does cover all the cases in lifelong learning, e.g., starting from a moderated size model, or from zero knowledge. The current methodology is still like finetuning a strong baseline on several small datasets.
