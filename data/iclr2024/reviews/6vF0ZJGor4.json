As a comparatively lightweight and effective solution, it has the potential to become a valuable tool in representation learning for collaborative filtering, contributing to both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. \n\nThe text is well-written and easy to follow.

Why do we drop the sum-to-one constraint (Section 3.2) (the authors did mention they have no good reasons, but why)?
