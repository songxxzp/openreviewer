                "value": "The paper introduces CommFormer, a novel approach for optimizing the communication architecture among multiple intelligent agents involved in collaborative tasks. By conceptualizing the architecture as a learnable graph and employing a bi-level optimization process with attention units, CommFormer enables agents to efficiently optimize their communication and adapt more coordinated strategies in a variety of scenarios, as demonstrated in experiments on StarCraft II combat games.\n\nI have several comments and questions that need to be addressed before publication:\n\n- what if the communication graph determined by your approach is not physically feasible, for instance due to environmental constraints such as a far physical distance, etc.? Isn\u2019t a graph communication approach that determines the communication based on physical proximity better in such real-world scenarios? Maybe the best solution is a hybrid approach where environment constraints are considered and baked into the problem for determining the communication graph?\n\n- I find the presented related work section to be weak and relatively old. Many recent SOTA graph-based multi-agent communication learning approaches are never mentioned or discussed, despite their high relevance to the proposed approach. For instance, [1]-[4] below are only a few of such works. Almost all of these works offer a distributed graph-based learned multi-agent communication method that work under POMDPs and are trained under CTDE. There are more of such recent paper. I believe the authors need to perform a more comprehensive search on the recent literature.\n\n[1] Seraj, Esmaeil, et al. \"Learning efficient diverse communication for cooperative heterogeneous teaming.\" Proceedings of the 21st international conference on autonomous agents and multiagent systems. 2022.\n\n[2] Niu, Yaru, Rohan R. Paleja, and Matthew C. Gombolay. \"Multi-Agent Graph-Attention Communication and Teaming.\" AAMAS. 2021.\n\n[3] Bettini, Matteo, Ajay Shankar, and Amanda Prorok. \"Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Reinforcement Learning.\" Proceedings of the 2023 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems. 2023.\n\n[4] Meneghetti, Douglas De Rizzo, and Reinaldo Augusto da Costa Bianchi. \"Towards heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning with graph neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.13161 (2020).\n\n- There are many existing recent, SOTA graph-based multi-agent communication learning approaches, see above [1]-[4] (which are not even mentioned in the paper), that could be a competition for the proposed approach. The selected benchmarks do not necessarily specialize in graph-based distributed communication. The proposed learned communication graph approach should be experimented and evaluated against other graph-based methods.\n\n- All the evaluations are performed in SMAC domains. Is this approach specialized and designed for SMAC? If not, and the solution is in fact generalizable, other domains and different problem settings must be considered. Many of such standard domains can be found in the prior work. Although SMAC domains are interesting game scenarios, the point is to have a comparable baseline performance in standard domains that can also solve other multi-agent coordination and collaboration problems, social interactions, etc.\n\n- Related to the point above, if the presented approach does not apply to other multi-agent problems and scenarios, this should be mentioned and discussed as a limitation. Otherwise, only presenting results in one domain does not suffice.\n\n- The second contribution bullet-point mentions the use of attention units for allocating credit to received messages. Doesn\u2019t TarMAC already do that?\n\n- What are the limitations of the approach? The limitations are never discussed.\n\nAt current states I vote weak rejection, since the algorithm seems to be sound and working, however there are some notable weaknesses in literature review and benchmarking (methods and domains) that need to be addressed as much as possible. I\u2019d be happy to increase my score further when authors satisfactorily addressed my comments and questions."

S = 0.4 is still quadratic in the number of agents, which can be limiting for large numbers of agents. Rather than having a sparsity proportion, wouldn't it be more relevant to evaluate sparsity as the actual number of non-zero values in the matrix?\n\nDoesn't this method overfit its communication graph to the task?

In reality, they create a bi-level optimization that steps the encoder/decoder optimizers to find approximate optima then update the adjacency matrix.

While this is not unreasonable, it is a very large assumption to make while claiming the CTDE paradigm. Further, in seciton 3.2, the authors state that they restrict communication of agent $i$ to only agents $j$ where $j< i$; this assumes that there is some implicit (or explicit) ordering of the agents that we are assuming.
