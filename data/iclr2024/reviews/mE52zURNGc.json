This provides a means to effectively control the convergence properties of the algorithm. Notably, even when employing self-supervised feature embeddings, this approach attains impressive accuracy compared to the SOTA direct image alignment methods that are trained end-to-end with pose supervision. Furthermore, it demonstrates enhanced robustness in terms of pose initialization."

The task is strongly affected by pose initialization, which has been addressed by prior art by switching to optimization methods that increase the convergence basin, such as the Gauss-Newton loss. The authors claim that these prior methods induce bias towards the training data which limits their generalization. \nThe papers main contribution addresses this problem. The authors introduce an analytical close from solution to the Gauss-Newton loss. This solution is independent of the feature representation and enables adjustment of the convergence basin based on the uncertainty in current estimates, giving control over the algorithm\u2019s convergence properties. This property is used during the experimental evaluation, where optimization is first performed on a uniform distribution with a wider range, but then is switched out to a Gaussian with an increasingly narrowing distribution. \nTheir secondary contributions are insights that the analytical solution provides. Specifically, they show that under their simplified conditions, the Gauss-Newton step is determined by the neighboring points of interest. The author conclude that this is inherently limiting in comparison to other optimization methods. \nExperimental results demonstrate superior performance in almost all results over supervised state-of-the-art methods using self-supervised descriptors. \nThe appendix provides further insights on the derivations, as well as more interesting experimental results."

                "value": "1) Well-written paper. It was a joy to read. It explains the context of the problem well, as well as establishing the necessary preliminary knowledge before delving into its actual contribution. There is a minor exception to this for the derivations (see Weaknesses)\n2) Under the simplifying assumption that eps follows an isotropic Gaussian, the authors derive a close-form solution to the minimizer of the Gauss-Netwon loss in expectation. Under the assumption that the authors claim about poor generalization due to training-data-biased feature maps holds (see Weaknesses), the proposed solutions has the main advantage that it provides unbiased feature map. In addition, it provides the ability to control the basin of convergence, which in turn makes the proposed method more robust to bad initialization (cf. Fig 3). Lastly, the assumed simplification which was necessary to derive the closed-form solution has been shown to lead to negligible differences (cf. Fig 5)\n3) Using self-supervised features, the proposed method is capable of outperforming supervised related work on almost all metrics. This is a strong statement, as the method can be used in conjunction with large and powerful foundation models, enabling bigger generalization due to the superior dataset sizes of such models. Therefore it is complimentary to these works.\n4) The authors provide an interesting insight when using Gauss-Newton as feature matching and indicate that it may be inherently limited. This is important for informing future work in optimization-based methods. Further analysis also shows that joint training of both losses for L_GN may lead to numerical instability and may shed light on reported training divergence of prior work."

                "value": "1) My biggest gripe with the paper is that their claim that motivates the approach is not empirically validated and there is no mention of such validation elsewhere. The authors claim both in the abstract as well as in the appendix that prior art use feature maps that may embed the inductive bias of the training data. While I can comprehend the underlying reasoning, such a claim needs to be empirically shown. \nFor example, an experiment on out-of-distribution test sets demonstrating the superiority of the closed-form solution would back the authors claims and in turn strengthen the paper.\n2) On the same topic of bias, I argue that the authors should explicitly state that their method still exhibits bias, but that the source of this is the underlying feature representation (result of this can be seen in Tbl. 1, Aachen Night dataset). Otherwise it may read that the authors claim their method is not biased. This is stated at the end of Section 3, but I think it should be stated clearly in either Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion section. This is a minor point however and only serves to improve clarity.\n3) A little contradictory to my point in the Strengths section, I believe the math heavy section 4 and 5 could be made a little more clearer when derivations skip multiple steps. Otherwise the sections read as if one equation immediately follows from the other, which is not always the case. (e.g Eq 6. -> Eq. 7). This would enhance the readability of the paper.\n4) On the Aachen-Night dataset, the proposed method clearly suffers. The authors claim that this is due to the underlying feature representation used, which was not trained day-night correspondences. While I find the reasoning sound, it would help the authors claim to have used a feature representation that have used such correspondences during training. This in turn would again strengthen the papers contribution and indicate that it can work in different settings."
