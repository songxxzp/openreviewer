How to measure the non-linearity of these functions?\n- Def 3.1 considers each activation function independently. How about combining two or more activation functions? Intuitively, by stacking the non-linearities, the overall non-linearity will grow exponentially.\n- How to interpret Figure 1? It seems that the non-linearity of sigmoid and gelu are better than relu. Then why does relu become the most widely used activation function?\n- About the result in Figure 9. How to interpret the negative correlation between the maximum affinity score and accuracy. It seems contradict with the NAS models results in Figure 20.\n- Could the proposed metric bring any new insights (or serve as a regularization term) to help us build better DNNs or design better activation functions?"

In the computation of affinity scores, which are tied to the activations within a neural network, there is an inherent dependence on both the input data and the network's parameters. My understanding is that affinity scores are influenced by the architecture and the parameters (the trained weights) of the network. However, it seems that in the evaluation of their experiments, the authors have placed a predominant focus on the architecture while possibly overlooking the significance of the network parameters. It is important to consider that the parameters, which are shaped by the training process, are crucial for the network's performance and ultimately for the validity of the affinity scores. An in-depth analysis that includes the impact of these parameters could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the network's behavior and the experimental outcomes.\n2. The author claims \"Despite being almost 20 times smaller than VGG16, the accuracy of Googlenet on Imagenet remains comparable, suggesting that increasing and varying the linearity is a way to have high accuracy with a limited computational complexity compared to predecessors.\u201d\nHowever, this assertion seems to overlook the fact that a significant portion of VGG16's parameters are concentrated in the final fully connected layers, which consist of two 4096-dimensional layers. Empirical evidence suggests that reducing the parameter count of these fully connected layers does not drastically diminish performance. Thus, concluding that 'increasing and varying the linearity is a way to have high accuracy with a limited computational complexity' may not be entirely justified."
