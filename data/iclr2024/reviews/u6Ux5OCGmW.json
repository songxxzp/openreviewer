                "value": "- There seems to be an inconsistency in defining neighborhoods in Section 3.1 and the choice of Riemannian metric in the experiments, which can confuse the readers significantly. The Riemannian metric $D_\\theta$ seems to be the ambient space metric. If this is the case, the norm $||\\cdot||$ should be defined using $D_\\theta$, but all derivations in Section 3 are based on assuming $D_\\theta = I$ (as per the proofs in Appendix A.1), implying the Euclidean ambient space. However, experiments employ $D_\\theta$ different from the identity, of which the choice seems arbitrary.\n- The claim of providing a tighter bound than SAM should be more carefully nuanced. The parameter spaces possessing a manifold structure are of little concern in the original SAM paper. Therefore, it would be more accurate to state that the provided bound is tighter \u2018when the parameter spaces have much smaller dimensionality than the ambient space\u2019 rather than making a general comparison to SAM.\n- RSAM seems to be a straightforward generalization of SAM to Riemannian manifolds, which might be considered a minor contribution unless the paper includes case studies applying the proposed algorithm to a range of Riemannian manifolds. While the Stiefel manifold considered in the paper is a relevant example, including application examples on other Riemannian manifolds would be beneficial.\n- Even though the experimental results suggest some performance advantages of using RSAM, the analysis is not sufficiently thorough. The primary reason for the improvement appears to be the use of the R-Stiefel layer, and the comparison of RSAM with SGD and SAM without the R-Stiefel layer may not be fair. For a more precise analysis of the generalization benefit of RSAM, further experimental studies are needed, such as comparing it to Riemannian SGD, which also employs the R-Stiefel layer.\n- The paper would benefit from clearer writing, particularly in Section 4."
