The focus of this research was on tailored fine-tuning methods that unleashed the potential of LLM's multilingual capabilities on a broader scale.\n\nThe paper demonstrated that instead of increasing data scale, intentional fine-tuning targeting key language capabilities might be the key to maximizing LLM performance.\n\nBy revealing the potential of smaller LLMs for efficient and accurate machine translation, this work laid the foundation for developing more user-friendly and scalable machine translation systems.

Typically, if an LLM was fine-tuned with specific bilingual corpora to enhance translation capabilities between those two languages, it might impair other NLP capabilities of the LLM, such as document summarization and logical question answering. Did this issue not arise in this study?\n\n2. If possible, please consider using the 'Instruct Score' from EMNLP 2023 (Instructscore: Towards Explainable Text Generation Evaluation with Automatic Feedback) as a metric. I believe it's a better benchmark for evaluating LLM-MT.\n\n3. The outputs of large models were uncertain. Even a minor change in a prompt could lead to variations in the output. During the two-stage fine-tuning process, was the specific impact of the prompt considered?\n\n3. Given the powerful In-Context Learning capabilities of large language models, it would be worth exploring whether adding relevant knowledge to the prompt could further enhance translation capabilities.\n\n4. The section \"Small Training Data Is Enough\" contained many uncertain descriptions, which should be rigorous in a paper and supported by convincing data. Moreover, the best-performing commercial LLM, GPT-4, remained proprietary, leaving us in the dark about the amount of data used, the number of parameters trained, and potential data leakage issues during translation metric testing.\n\n5. The sentence in the \"Large Parallel Data Wash Out the Knowledge\" section: \"As expected, it tends up with a similar performance in both BLEU and COMET evaluations (triangle in Figure 4),\" was hard to understand.\n\n6. The proposed method significantly improved translation metric scores, highlighting ALMA's effectiveness. Based on this, how did the authors believe LLM generalized translation capabilities? Did the proposed method fundamentally assist LLMs in learning deep bilingual text alignment?"

There is no modelling or training innovation in the paper, but they are the first to show that you can take a smaller English focussed language model (LLaMa 7B,13B) and make it into a translation model with equivalent performance to a large LLM (GPT 3.5 &4) using relatively small amounts of monolingual (20B?) and parallel data (1B) in a fine-tuning step. The paper is generally clearly written but some important details are missing, some claims are not entirely supported, and there are some typos. \n\nIn more detail:\nThey first show that large models (GPT3.5) do extremely well translating into and out of  5 diverse languages and English, mostly high resource except for Icelandic. They then select the best performing smaller model (7B parameters) and experiment on fine-tuning to the translation task using instructions. They show that LLama27B quickly maxes out after 10k examples, whereas MPT-7B continues improving until the final datapoint at 20M. \nThey then experiment with using monolingual data in pretraining, and finetuning with instructions, and call the resulting model ALMA. They show that with a relatively small multilingual (but not parallel) pretraining dataset 1B, they get significant gains in translation quality. Also they used high quality parallel data for finetuning and experimented with full fine-tuning and LORA fine-tuning."

However, their other model MPT-7B does keep improving and does not max out even at the 20M mark.\nThe citation for this claim in the intro: \"they still fall short in translation for low-resource languages\" Zhang et al. is wrong. They do not look at low resource languages, only experiments with English, Chinese and German. \nThey conclude: \"From our observations, LLMs should not adopt the same training approach as earlier models\u2014whether randomly initialized or pre-trained\u2014that rely heavily on vast amounts of training data\" but do not specify that this is just for the fine-tuning LLaMa - it is a too broad claim to make.\n\nSome things are not explained or described:\nThey do not explain why they selected MPT for experiments in 3.2, and more importantly they do not discuss why it performs contrary to their claimed results - that LLMs to not voraciously consume parallel data. \nAlso for Section 5 they do not say how much parallel data is used for fine-tuning and what ratios of parallel data are we using - same as the monolingual data? This really should be detailed in the main paper. \nThis caption is confusing \"Figure 5: The average performance of ALMA-7B at the completion of each 1B-token fine-tuning\". Is this without the instruction fine-tuning? How do these numbers compare to Tables 1 and 2? I can't figure this out due to the differences in the data - but it seems like the instruction fine-tuning makes little/no difference here. (Fig5) 85.28 COMET vs. (84.12 + 86.27) / 2 (Table 1 and 2) for the ALMA7B?\n\nThere are a number of typos and inconsistencies that need to be polished for final submission: \nThe ALMA models are called AMLA,\nTypo:  \"As expected, it tends up with a similar performance \". \nThe graphics are not very consistent in the paper and don't look clean or very legible. Figure 5 is particularly  hard to read.  \nResults are not very structured.

            "questions": {
                "value": "Firstly, the authors claim the finding/proposal is a \"paradigm shift\" as highlighted in the title, which might be inadequate. The recipe generally follows the pretraining-finetuning paradigm which has already been well-established since BERT and mBart/T5. In addition, similar solutions have already been used in prior studies, such as BigTranslate.\n\nSecondly, the few-shot results are largely undervalued. As shown in Table 11, the quality gap between the HW 5-shot and the proposal is only 0.2 COMET on XX->En, although the finetuning used a large amount of monolingual corpus and more parallel data. Few-shot performance should be able to be further enhanced via beam search and optimized prompt construction, and it should be used as the fair baseline rather than 0-shot prompting. It's also misleading to state in Appendix I that \"ICL substantially underperforms our stage-2 finetuning\". \n\nLastly, finetuning performance is highly dependent on pretraining conditions and the downstream task. Intuitively, when the downstream tasks highly correlate with the pretraining, the demand for a large volume of the supervised corpus is reduced as highlighted in this paper. However, as the MPT-7B performance indicates in Figure 4, when the correlation is low, adding more supervised data is almost always helpful. In other words, the findings in this paper might not be generalization. Do you also have the finetuning results for MPT-7B? Does the recipe also apply to low-resource languages like Gu?"
