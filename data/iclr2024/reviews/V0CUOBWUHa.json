                "value": "This paper works on generating sentence embeddings using large language models. First,  the authors design a specific prompt  to compress the semantic of an input sentence into a single word.  Then, this paper investigates zero-shot,  in-context and fine-tuning settings of sentence embedding learning.  For in-context learning,  this paper proposes a demonstration selection method for inducing good sentence representations.  For fine-tuning, to solve the large memory issue,  the authors use QLoRA to perform contrastive learning.  Empirical results on common sentence embedding evaluation benchmarks with both OPT and LLaMA series models show that the proposed method can match (or even exceed) the performance of pretrained language models (such as BERT)."

This method is an adaptation of PromptBERT's approach for autoregression models.\n* It leverages in-context-learning in order to improve the quality of sentence embeddings. To this end, it relies on two approaches: 1) It generates one-word summaries of sentences from the STS training set using GPT-3.5. 2) It leverages entries from the Oxford dictionary. The concatenation of samples from these two sources is then incorporated into the LLM's prompt.\n* It leverages fine-tuning with contrastive learning to further improve the quality of sentence embeddings. It does so by leveraging qLORA and training on supervised datasets such as SNLI and MNLI.\n\n\nThe paper's conclusions are as follow:\n* The explicit one-word limitation prompt improves the quality of sentence embeddings derived from OPT on STS benchmarks.\n* In-context learning and supervised fine-tuning improve the performance on STS benchmarks, allowing the proposed solution to beat the state of the art. However, the resulting embeddings do not transfer as well to other tasks.\n* In the paper's proposed setup, the largest base models do not have a clear performance advantage: best results on STS without fine-tuning are obtained with OPT's variants ranging between 1.3 and 6.7B parameters."

The prompting strategy combining GPT-augmented STS sentences and oxford definitions is novel as well, and the use of qLORA to make contrastive fine-tuning feasible for larger models shows creativity in putting together existing solutions.\n\n* Quality: The experiments are well-devised and executed. The proposed methods are simple and beat the state of the art on semantic textual similarity benchmarks.\n\n* Clarity: The paper articulates very clearly its methodology. It is easy to read and describes well the corresponding pre-existing work. It motivates very well the choice of an explicit one-word prompt, the value of in-context learning and the need for quantization in order to fine-tune the largest models in a contrastive learning setup.\n\n* Significance: while the results on STS benchmarks look good, both in-context learning and contrastive fine-tuning do not show incremental value on transfer tasks. The relatively low generalisation capabilities of these methods limit greatly the appeal of such techniques for the average practitioner, as most real-life applications of sentence embeddings are not for semantic textual similarity."

The 1/3-2/3 mix of STS sentences vs Oxford definitions would benefit from an explicit ablation.\n\n* The value of ICL and CSE is demonstrated only for OPT. Indeed, table 1 is missing results that would demonstrate the added value of ICL and CSE on Llama.\n\n* The proposed methods (in-context learning and possibly fine-tuning) are performing worse than simple explicit-one-word-limit prompting on transfer tasks.\n\n* It is not clear what section 5.2 demonstrates:\n  * first, the text mentions \"in-context learning examples that were obtained from each model on the STS-B development set\", while the table caption reads \"In-context learning examples used in various model size\". The paper states clearly in section 3.2 that the in-context learning examples (1) come from the STS-B training set and (2) are not generated / obtained from the model itself.\n  * second, the method used to sample the data from table 4 is not described, and the meaning of the \"Improve\" column is not clear: does it correspond to the improvement coming from one additional sentence in the prompt? Or from the addition of the 100s of sentences in the ICL prompt? In any case, it seems premature to draw generic conclusions such as \"related examples are usually more implicit\" from a sample size of 1 from each model. Appending 5-10 random samples of each category in the appendix would give more compelling evidence for this.\n  * finally, it is not clear how to relate the findings of section 5.2 to the overall quality of the sentence embeddings introduced by this work.\n\n* Typos and errors:\n  * table 6, the first group of data rows should mention (16-bit)\n  * table 8, the ordering is not the same between the \"Without fine-tuning\" and \"Fine-tuning on unsupervised datasets\" groups of rows."
