This investigation hold promise, as recent studies have highlighted the propensity for challenging in-distribution (ID) samples to be mistakenly classified as OOD. The authors provide a theoretical foundation for understanding SCOD, and they introduce a method that adeptly integrates existing SC and OOD detection techniques. The experimental results affirm that the proposed method performs admirably in SCOD settings."

The proposed strategy in the footnote considers $(x,y)$ and not simply $x$. The way I see it is that it is impossible to obtain a strict $S^*_{in}$ without full knowledge on $P_{out}$.\n5.  For CIFAR, the proposed SCOD learning in algorithm 1 does not seem to yield better results than training only on the CE loss and using heuristic scores to perform SCOD.

The unification of the selective classification (SC) and OOD detection areas has recently been explored, but its formal underpinnings have not been fully developed. The paper presents a formal statistical analysis of SCOD and derives the Bayes-optimal solution for the classifier, rejector pair. This solution generalizes the Bayes-optimal solutions for the SC and OOD detection problems considered separately. Based on this solution, they propose plug-in estimators for optimally combining confidence scores for SC and density-ratio scores for OOD detection. This provides a principled way of combining existing scoring methods from the SC and OOD detection areas to address the SCOD problem. They address two settings, the first one being a black-box setting with only in-distribution training data, and the second one being a loss-based setting where one additionally has access to an unlabeled mixture of in-distribution and OOD data."

The proposed statistical formulation and Bayes optimal solution for the classifier and rejector is a general result that can guide the design of selective classifiers that can reject on both uncertain in-distribution (mis-classified) inputs and OOD inputs. Although the areas of selective classification and OOD detection have been independently studied well, a combined analysis of the problems in a principled setting has been lacking and somewhat heuristic. This paper addresses the gap. \n\n- The proposed plug-in estimators specify how to optimally combine existing confidence scores from the selective classification literature and density-ratio scores from the OOD detection literature. Therefore, it allows researchers in these areas to leverage, in a principled way, existing scoring methods for selective classification and OOD detection. The novelty of the paper does not lie in new approaches to estimate the confidence scores or the density-ratio scores, but rather in how to optimally combine them for the SCOD problem.\n\n- They also propose a loss-based approach for learning the classifier and rejector by leveraging an unlabeled mixture of in-distribution and OOD data \u201cin the wild\u201d (similar to Katz-Samuels et al., 2022). \n\n- Overall, the paper was interesting and insightful to read.

For instance, the cost of false negatives $c_{fn}$, the maximum rejection rate $b_{rej}$, the proportion of inlier and OOD data in the unlabeled set $S_{mix}$, the choice of training OOD data $P^{tr}_{out}$.

            "questions": {
                "value": "### 1. Conditional probability?\nIn the formulation of selective classification, would it not be better to use the conditional probability of misclassification given the input is accepted, i.e. $P_{in}(y \\neq h(x) \\~|\\~ r(x) = 0)$? Also, under the subsection `Evaluation metrics` on page 8, the joint risk is divided by the total number of accepted inputs, which seems to be consistent with the conditional probability.\n\n### 2. On the Lagrangian\nIt is not clear to me how to arrive at the Lagrangian in Eqn (4) from the objective (3). Based on my simplification of the Lagrangian from the SCOD objective (3), I am getting a slightly different form than that in Eqn (4). Specifically, I get $c\\_{in} = \\lambda \\pi^{\\star}\\_{in}$ and $c\\_{out} = c\\_{fn} - \\lambda (1 - \\pi^{\\star}\\_{in})$. Referring to Section 4.3, it seems like $c_{in}$ and $c_{out}$ specified here may have been swapped? \n\nAlso, it seems to me the multiplier of the first term in Eqn (4) is $(1 \\~-\\~ c\\_{out} \\~-\\~ ((1 - \\pi^{\\star}\\_{in}) / \\pi^{\\star}\\_{in}) \\\\, c\\_{in})$, rather than $1 - c\\_{in} - c\\_{out}$. \n\nIt is certainly possible I missed/messed something, but would appreciate some clarification. \n\n### 3. Need for strictly-inlier dataset\nIt seems to me that the strictly-inlier dataset $S^{\\star}\\_{in}$ is only needed for estimating the mixture proportion $\\hat{\\pi}\\_{mix}$. It is not clear why the labeled inlier dataset $S_{in}$ (with the labels discarded) cannot be used in place of $S^{\\star}\\_{in}$ for estimating $\\hat{\\pi}_{mix}$. Any theoretical reason for this?\n\n### 4. Estimation of $\\pi^{\\star}\\_{in}$\nPlease clarify if $\\pi^{\\star}\\_{in}$ used in the formulation for SCOD Eqn (3) can be estimated using $\\hat{\\pi}_{mix}$? Does it have to be estimated at test time as mentioned in Footnote 3 on page 7? From my understanding, the mixture dataset $S\\_{mix}$ is collected \u201cin the wild\u201d during deployment, which should give a good idea of $\\pi^{\\star}\\_{in}$ as well. \n\n### Suggestions for the Theorems/Lemmas\n- Would help to restate the Lemma/Theorem statements in the appendix.\n- Some comments/takeaways on Lemma 4.1 and Lemma 4.2 would be useful.\n- In Lemma 3.1, I believe it should be: Let $(h^\\star, r^\\star)$ denote any minimiser of (3) (not (2)).\n- In the proof of Lemma 3.1 (Appendix A), it seems like the reject class $\\perp$ is allowed to be part of the classifier $h(x)$ output. However, the classifier is originally defined as $h : \\mathcal{X} \\mapsto [L]$. Please clarify this point. \n- Some pointers could be added to the proofs. For example, Eqn (13) on page 18 follows from Pinsker\u2019s inequality, which is worth mentioning.\n- Lemma 4.2: it should be $s^\\star$ not $r^\\star$.\n- Lemma 4.2: it would be useful to clarify that $p_{\\perp}(x)$ is an approximation for $P^\\star(z = 1 \\~|\\~ x)$. The $\\perp$ symbol is commonly used for rejection, whereas here it corresponds to the probability of accepting. \n- Lemma 4.2: for introducing coupling implicitly it should be $s(x) = u^T \\Phi(x)$ (no dependency on $y\u2019$ here).\n- Typo in the first line of the Proof of Lemma 4.2 on page 17: it should be $s^\\star(x) = \\log(P^\\star(z=1 | x) / P^\\star(z=-1 | x))$.\n\n### Rejector definition\nMight be better to define the rejectors $r^\\star(x)$ and $r_{BB}(x)$ in Eqn (5) and Eqn (8) directly using the indicator function $\\mathbb{1}[\\cdot]$.\n\n### On the Algorithm\n- Line 3 of Algorithm 1: should it be $\\hat{f} : \\mathcal{X} \\mapsto \\mathrm{R}^L$? That is, $\\hat{f}$ predicts a logit for each of the $L$ classes.\n- Line 7 of Algorithm 1: Can directly specify the final classifier $\\hat{h}(x) = \\arg\\max_{y} \\hat{f}_y(x)$ since it does not depend on Eqn (8). Can also specify that $s\\_{sc}(x) = \\max\\_{y} \\hat{f}_y(x)$ in Eqn (8).\n\n### Other points\n1. Under `Baselines` on page 8: reference for energy-based scorer should be (Liu et al., 2020b) and (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017) should also be cited for MSP.\n\n2. In Table 2, why do methods such as MSP, MaxLogit, and Energy (which do not use OOD training data) have different performance under the two settings: $P^{tr}\\_{out}=$ Random300K and $P^{tr}\\_{out}=$ OpenImages? \n\n3. From Table 4, it seems that the performance of `Plug-in BB [L_1]` is consistently worse than `SIRC [L_1]`, despite the former (proposed) method being more principled. Please explain this discrepancy. \n\n4. I think it would be useful to provide results of this method using the Deep NN method (Sun et al., 2022), especially on the ImageNet dataset, since it seems like the grad-norm scorers are not providing good estimates of the density ratio.  \n\n5. It might be worth citing the following paper which characterizes the Bayes-optimal detector for mis-classification detection.  \nDoctor: A simple method for detecting misclassification errors, https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/hash/2cb6b10338a7fc4117a80da24b582060-Abstract.html"
