As a result, in Table 5, IRAD cannot exhibit robustness when SampleNet is attacked simultaneously. \n\n3. In my opinion, such a resampling method cannot effectively defend against white-box attacks. However, it might be effective in defending against black-box attacks, especially transfer-based attacks [1,2,3]. I suggest you add such a comparison.\n\n4. Since image resampling pre-processes the input image before the model, it is similar to a purifier that eliminates adversarial perturbation [4]. I think it is necessary to compare with such baselines.\n\n[1]  Zhang et al. Patch-wise attack for fooling deep neural network. ECCV 2020.\n\n[2] Wang et al.

Unlike conventional heuristic sampling strategies, SampleNet is designed to predict pixel-wise shifts based on the embedding of the input image automatically. Moreover, in a pursuit of optimal performance and a marked increase in processing speed, the authors have integrated their method with DiffPure."

The paper's objective is to construct an implicit representation for the input image and then reconstruct the clean image from this implicit representation, claiming that the reconstructed image would be free from any adversarial patterns. However, if we assume that the underlying implicit representation faithfully represents the input signal, it should also contain the adversarial patterns that present in the input signal. This contradicts the explanation for why the proposed method is effective.\n\nTo the best of my thoughts, the only plausible explanation to explain why the proposed method works well quantitatively is that the underlying implicit representation is biased toward fitting low-frequency or smooth signals, and thus, it fails to represent high-frequency adversarial patterns. However, this would imply a degradation in the image quality represented in the implicit model, as it suggests that the model cannot faithfully represent high-frequency signals.
