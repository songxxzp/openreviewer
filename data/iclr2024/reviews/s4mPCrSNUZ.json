Furthermore, as acknowledged by the authors, leveraging historical analogs for modeling guidance is a well-trodden idea in this field[1], which suggests a constrained conceptual contribution.\n\n## Ill-defined task\nIt is noteworthy that the task of predicting protein sequences given a backbone structure is ambiguously defined. Conventionally, in protein design, the backbone and sequence are designed concurrently, underscoring a more common practice in the field[2].\n\n## Lack of Accessibility to a General AI Audience\nThe manuscript employs certain acronyms such as USR-V and TM-align without elucidation, which may impede comprehension for a general ICLR audience.\n\nReference:\n[1] Song, Y., DiMaio, F., Wang, R.

Additionally authors provide an ablation study allowing for deeper understanding of how each of the individual components affects final performance and verify their predictions in silico with orthogonal folding method. USR-V similarity search method described by the authors is a moderately small extension of the original papers (Ballester et al, 2007, J. Comput. Chem and Guo et al. 2022, Bioinformatics). Overall the paper is well written, structured and easy to follow. It touches on one of the fundamental problems in computational biology and research in this direction may have potential to enable accurate and rapid design of functional protein molecules for use in medicine or green industries."

I believe that this statement is not properly supported by the data, in particular:\n\na) It's not clear how the method speed compares to state-of-the-art tools like FoldSeek (van Kempen et al, 2023, Nat Communications), 3D Zernike approach used in the PDB structural searches (Guzenko et al, 2020, Plos Comput Biol).\n\nb) It's also not clear how efficient the method is compared to e.g. FoldSeek in extracting analogous structures. The pre-alignment step relies on global shape comparison which can prohibit from detection of some of sub-domain sized analogous fragments or fail to work with multidomain proteins (I also miss discussion of this in limitations of the authors approach).\n\nI believe that extra experiments and comparisons are required to support the statements for this part or the text should be rewritten.\n\n- SPDesign workflow is compared to the methods that do not take advantage of sequence profiles. \n\nI agree with authors that combination of sequence profiles and GNNs for protein design can be considered as novel and interesting but there are already several available design methods that rely on the MSAs or PSSMs - e.g. Sgarbossa et. al, 2022, Elife or traditional Rosetta(Scripts) FavorSequenceProfile mover, to name a few. I believe that statements in the paper could be more convincing if authors add more MSA-related baselines. Also, to large extent, authors fail to discuss these more traditional but still large and meaningful body of work in the related work section. \n\n- Lack of diverse metrics & analyses.\n\nProtein design is a complex problem and frequently multiple solutions are equally good / stable for a given input backbone structure. Native sequence recovery is an important metric but doesn't tell the full story about the method properties and performance. I think it'd be valuable to understand e.g. how diverse are the sequences generated by the SPDesign for a given backbone, how closely designs resemble the natural sequence profiles, is the performance equal or better / worse for particular secondary structure elements or surface / buried residues? (see e.g. \u00d3 Conch\u00fair et al, 2015, Plos One, Ollikainen et al, 2013 Plos Comput Biol, Castorina et al, 2023, Bioinformatics for more examples of metrics / analyses)"
