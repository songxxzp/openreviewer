Also, readers do not see how we select one of the 4 proposed methods depending on the situation.\n1. Overall, the paper is written as a technical extension of the hyperbolic entailment cone method, but the current draft does not position the proposed method well in the context of the whole partial order embedding area. It is not an unacceptable way, but limits the readers. The authors might want to compare it with other methods such as Order embedding, Gaussian embedding, Box embedding, etc.\n1. The title of the paper lacks essential keywords and confuses readers. It should include the word \"shadow cone.\" Also, if possible, the words \"hierarchy\" or \"partial order\" could be included. Readers might think the phrase \"dark side\" indicates the surface of a hemisphere, rather than a shadow cone. Also, from the word \"moon,\" readers feel the impression that the embedding has a volume. However, this is not the case for the penumbral cone embedding. I am aware that we have many styles on which we title a paper, but, at least, we need to avoid confusing readers."

The authors show that such framework can be particularly efficient to learn a latent embeddings of nodes for trees or more generally for DAGs. Their method extends to the concept of entailment cones previously introduced by Ganea.

First, I think it should be clarified that we can do the link prediction without the embedding step (this would have a 100% accuracy) and then mention that you do the embedding step to understand the how well the embedding performs. As part of the experiment, it would be good to have a baseline for Euclidean poset embedding. However, I admit I do not know of one. Maybe on of the DAG learning papers has a baseline that could be used. \n\n3) Building on the above it would be good to show that such embeddings can be used other non-trivial down stream tasks and that such embeddings provide an advantage. \n\n[1] X.

I see that the umbral method seems to perform the best. I imagine based on how the loss in formulated this pushes the point to the interior of the cone rather than leaving it on the boundary where we might have numerical issues. \n\n4) Could the authors provide intuition for why umbral cones are not geodetically convex? I believe in this regard calling them cones might be a bit confusing, because cones in Euclidean space are not only convex, but contains these geodesic rays.

While in the important baseline ``hyperbolic entailment cones'', the Poincar\u00e9 ball is used, if the proposed cone generalizes ``hyperbolic entailment cone'', it should be as good as the ``hyperbolic entailment cone''.\n3.

This framework extends beyond the Poincar\u00e9 ball, allowing for more diverse formulations and hyperbolic space models. Shadow cones offer advantages over existing constructions, particularly in terms of optimization properties. Experimental results demonstrate the consistent and significant outperformance of shadow cones compared to existing entailment cone constructions across datasets of varying sizes and hierarchical structures."
