                "value": "The authors of this paper have introduced a novel approach to address the challenges associated with low-rank regularization (LRR) in the context of various machine-learning tasks. LRR has found widespread application, but the optimization of these relaxed LRRs has typically relied on singular value decomposition, a time-consuming and non-differentiable operator that cannot be optimized using gradient-based techniques.\nIn response to these challenges, the authors have presented an efficient and differentiable approximation of generalized LRR. This form of LRR encompasses well-known options like the nuclear norm, the Schatten-p norm, and various nonconvex relaxations. Their proposed method allows for the seamless integration of LRR terms into loss functions, making it compatible with off-the-shelf machine-learning libraries for convenient optimization. Moreover, this approximation relies solely on matrix multiplication, a GPU-friendly operation that facilitates efficient parallel implementation."

The authors should present the detailed algorithms as well as convergence analysis when using the proposed model for specific applications such as matrix completion as well as video foreground and background separation.\n2.\tSome important related works such as [1-5] should be discussed and compared in this work as they are representative works that are dealing with the same problem as the current work.\n3.\tSome of the presentation is not correct, such as \u201c\u2026key problem of the matrix factorization is that it demands strong prior knowledge on the matrix rank\u2026\u201d. To my knowledge, the variational representation of the nuclear norm as well as the non-convex regularization do not need to know the exact rank, such as [1,2,4,5].\n4.\tThe authors argue that the SVD is not differentiable, please refer to [6] for more information.\n5.\tSome of the experimental results are vague. Specifically, in Table 1, the running time of MSS is slower than IRNN. As for as I know, MSS is a representative factorization-based model which is much faster than the IRNN. Besides, the proposed model provides an equivalent representation of the nuclear norm and non-convex rank regularization function, the overall mathematic model is the same as the low rank regularization function implied on the original full matrix. Why does the performance of the proposed method present in Table 1 is much better than existing methods with the same mathematical model? Where does the performance gain come from?  \n[1] Ornhag, M.
