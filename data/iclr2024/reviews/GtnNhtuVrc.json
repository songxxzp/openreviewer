The idea is to have two identical deep learning network for teacher and student. The teacher is only fed with the unlabeled data, while the student network takes in both labeled and unlabeled data, in a bid to dynamically set the threshold of the unlabeled data pseudo label which is used to guide the student network. The pseudo label assignment is done through assessing an event-union probability of a group of neighboring pixels wherein the probability that at least one pixel belongs to a given class is computed. Using the neighboring pixels introduces the contextual cues to enhance the pseudo label propagation."

The techniue extends previous approaches based on unsupervised consistency where predictions of the teacher branch are used as targets for training the student. In order to avoid meaningless learning, these approaches train only on the most confident teacher predictions. The proposed technique extends this idea by expressing the confidence according to an upper bound of probability of that a small pixel neighbourhood contains more predictions of the same class. The technique changes the baseline method in two ways. First, the learning takes into account more unlabeled pixels since the threshold \\gamma_t is a quantile of the pixel-level confidence (5) that tends to be less than the proposed union-level confidence. Second, the consistency loss also works on union-level predictions instead of on pixel-level predictions."
