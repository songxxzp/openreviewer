Why not offer ablation studies for choices of functions and constants involved? \n- Also regarding the loss: I personally think one explanation for the max-margin loss is to battle with the imbalance, at the same time train the deputy to \u201cspread-out\u201d and learn all diverse data being fed. As a result, my hypothesis is with the current design, the imbalance loss from, say Gshard (and other methods could be used too in the RELATED WORK point below). Would be nice to study the ablations at some point. \n\n- RELATED WORK: seems lack of many relevant work especially when it comes to imbalance issues: \n  - Gshard \n  - BASE layers: Simplifying training of large, sparse models.\n  - Hash layers for large sparse models.\n  - Mixture-of-experts with expert choice routing.\n  - I suggest maybe should also see some updated related work including some from this year in new preprints such as in \u201cTask-Based MoE for Multitask Multilingual Machine Translation\u201d, in which the motivation is somewhat similar but the implementation seems more practical and scalable than the method in this paper (see weaknesses for more explanation on this). \n\n\n\n- Human evaluation probably needs further clarification and only 3 of them do not seem convincing enough. Also, how were their employments made (see ethics section as well), and why only PhD students were chosen? \n- BertScore is a decent choice, but I suggest since you already used GPT3.5, that you could use GPT3.5 or 4 to do the comparison as well, by having an instruction and ask the model to compare different models based on, e.g. 3 criteria in Table 2, then summarize the results.

Furthermore, there is a concatenation of parameters and activations in equations 6 and 7, which would result in more parameters. Consequently, when using experts, the concatenation of features makes MoeSumm a larger model than the BART-indiv baseline, which could explain the advantage of MoeSumm in the in-domain setting. Thus, it would be very informative to have a table with actual parameter count for each setting, especially during training (frequently the most important bottleneck).\n\nPrevious work that approaches parameter-efficient summarization by separating domain-specific concerns is not compared. FactorSum (Fonseca et al., 2022) also uses a BART backbone to capture general importance and uses a separate optimization procedure for domain-specific factors such as summary conciseness. It achieves superior performance (measured by ROUGE) than MoeSumm on arXiv and PubMed using less parameters (BART-base). In contrast, MoeSumm explores a wider range of domain-adaptation settings. \n\nWhile I appreciate the analysis of dataset features in Section 5.2, item 3, more detailed analysis of the weight of each feature would be informative. Especially with respect to *summary length*, which are known to heavily affect ROUGE (Sun et al., 2019).\n\n- Simeng Sun, Ori Shapira, Ido Dagan, and Ani Nenkova. 2019.
