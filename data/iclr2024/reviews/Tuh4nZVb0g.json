                "value": "The authors propose an interesting way to do time series forecasting and classification with pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). Whereas LLMs are designed to be used via prompts, the authors propose to find time series embeddings that are introduced in the model instead of finding suitable prompts. In this way, by considering an end-to-end approach, where the embeddings are adjusted according to the given dataset keeping the LLM weights frozen, the authors show that the proposed methodology does present a competitive performance. In particular, the larger the model, i.e. LLaMa-13B, the better the performance, potentially outperforming SOTA models like transformers. Finally, the authors present a brief analysis on the embeddings learn by the model, which suggests that these are mainly composed by adjectives/sentiments."

Interestingly, the authors consider that by freezeing the weights of the LLM one can obtain embeddings that are leading to a competitive performance in terms of forecasting and classification. \n\nPerhaps the most interesting point would be to understand the kind of embeddings that are obtained from the proposed methodology."

There is no code included. This is relevant as I wonder if one can reproduce the experiments given the current writing quality of the paper.\n\n3. There are no evaluations for zero-shot evaluations. According to the motivation of the paper, it might be relevant as well to consider the case where the time series embedding is developed in a particular dataset, and then tested in another one. Although this might not be necessarily too far from the few-shot evaluation already presented.\n\n4. There is no analysis on time execution.

It I understand correctly, this is as well the largest pretrained model considered. Further, one can see that for GPT2, the larger the model, the better the performance. Do we know, or can we do a conjecture, on what is the limiting performance in terms of model size (number of parameters)?\n\n6. Why is LLM-QA not showing any variance? Or why is it depicted in this way? \n\n7. Why is one-fits-all not used in *all* forecasting experiments? If I understand correctly, one can use it for comparison.\n\n8. Why are not other models considered here? for instance DeepAR, MQCNN, Wavenet, NHiTS, NBeats, etc for these experiments? Even models like ARIMA, ETS, seasonal naive would be interesting to consider.\n\n9. From 3.d it seems that the prompt length should be restricted to not be particularly large, but suprisingly the smaller the number of parameters (GPT-117M) the better the performance. How does this fit with the previous observation that larger models perform better?\n\n10. On Embeddings (section 4.3): how does the embeddings change per model? For instance, what are the embeddings when using BERT-335M, GPT2-774M, etc?\n\n11. When it comes to forecasting, is the proposed approach a point-wise or a probabilistic forecaster?\n\n12. What is the performance if the LLM taken is the one of the first checkpoint, i.e. when the weights of the model are random? What is the gap between these case those taken for the current experiments?\n\n13. What is the time execution/complexity of the proposed approach. Does this depend on the pretrained model in consideration? For instance, would it take longer of LLaMa-13B than for BERT-110M?\n\n14. What is the performance per dataset when it comes to time series forecasting? The current experimental setting only reports results aggregated across different datasets."

The instance-wise objective pulls closer to similar instance embeddings. The feature-wise objective is applied to each feature column to further discriminate instances.
