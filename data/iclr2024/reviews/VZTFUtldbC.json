The robots used in simulation, moreover, have very similar structures, for a more convincing argument I would show more experiments between quite different morphologies and tasks. Even without real robot experiments, it would go a long way to consider several difficulties that show up in real robot experiments: sensor noise, not having access to joint velocity measurements, actuator limits etc.\n\n* It would be nice to show when and if the proposed method fails: this would help to understand how the method contributes to the literature better and also pave the way to more research."

                "value": "It is really unclear to me why the proposed approach will surely learn modular controllers. Specifically, the approach this paper proposes is to use reinforcement learning to train a monolithic policy (here done via PPO). This learned policy is then used to generate data which is used in an imitation learning setup. \n\nSpecifically, the authors say \n\n\u201cThe goal of Imitation Learning \u2026. train models that are transferable to variety of context (e.g. robot structures and tasks). This requires modules to represent meaningful behavior, which we enforce by imposing an information bottleneck on the master controller.\u201d\n\nBut a fundamental problem with this approach is that the RL policy  has been trained on one task alone. Using an asymmetric approach to train the modular policy (with noise) does not in any way guarantee that the policies learned by individual modules will transfer to new tasks or morphologies. It is only because the task being considered here are too simplistic and almost within domain that we see positive transfer. Specifically, the robot manipulation example uses 4 fingers to train and 5 fingers to evaluate. However, the grasping policy in each of these settings is very similar basically, each finger basically has to push into the object. Further, grasping with greater than 2 fingers is anyways quite easy. Hence, it is really unclear if there is any modular structure. It would be interesting and make the paper much better if more challenging tasks are considered. Specifically, tasks where modularity is well defined. \n\nCan the authors provide any reason why this method will learn truly modular policies? Also, would this approach work if I define each joint of a 7dof robot as a separate module and then try to transfer to a 6-dof robot or another 7-dof robot with very different morphology? \n\n**train models that are transferable to variety of context (e.g. robot structures and tasks)**: Is there any limitation on the kind of tasks that this approach transfers or would this work across all different kinds of tasks? I think these above statements which form the crux of the paper are quite vague and do not precisely tell the reader where this approach can work and what are its failure modes.\n\n**More Manipulation Experiments:** The paper argues that this is a general approach. However, most experiments are in walking domains (e.g. centipedes and worms). Can more manipulation tasks be considered for this approach? For instance, I am wondering whether a task (e.g. opening an oven) when done in slightly different configurations or with objects of different sizes still allows modular controllers to be learned from *a single task instance* (as done here)."
