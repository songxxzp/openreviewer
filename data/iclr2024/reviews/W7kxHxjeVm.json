The authors propose a novel approach called ImAD that combines data imputation and anomaly detection in a unified framework. The proposed method generates pseudo-abnormal samples from the latent space to mitigate the imputation bias that the traditional two-stage methods tend to exhibit. Experimental results show that it outperforms baseline methods in common scenarios."

The results primarily rely on conventional approaches that do not explicitly account for missing data, such as DeepSVDD. \n- Experimental scenarios are too limited. Only two datasets are tested, while there exist many other benchmark datasets available for anomaly detection. The choice of two specific missing rates (0.2 and 0.5) may not realistically represent the practical scenarios. Only AUROC results are presented, omitting other essential metrics. \n- Although this paper includes some theoretical analysis in section 3.6, the derivations of the inequalities appear to be straightforward in the context of plain neural nets. It remains unclear whether these inequalities provide more valuable insights than those derived from other related methods, especially on practical utility."

One of the key challenges being addressed is to ensure that the imputation model trained on normal data should generalize to abnormal data. Authors pursue a generative modeling approach to generate pseudo-abnormal samples and learn an imputation model on both samples.  A composite loss term evaluating imputation, anomaly and reconstruction losses is formulated for the proposed method. Authors provide results on sample UCI datasets and compare performance to deep learning based anomaly detection and other AD baselines."

                "value": "1) Figure 1 uses AUROC on y-axis whereas for anomaly detection I think AUPR is better to motivate as most anomaly detection techniques have poor precision. Also Adult and KDD are UCI datasets which do not have a lot of relevance today as most techniques perform superlatively on these datsets. Given that the framework is applicable for missing values, it makes more sense to benchmark/motivate on real world use cases for anomaly detection (IoT sensor data, etc)\n2) Section 3.5 seems way too short and not very insightful with the purpose of just being added in the paper to have such a section in the main paper.\n3) Also on a more real-world applicability note, imputation is not often used within industry and missing data if any is more often discarded. I would encourage authors to think of very strong real-world insights of when imputation should be used and when should it be avoided."
