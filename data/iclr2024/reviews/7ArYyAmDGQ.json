The main contribution is that the i.i.d. assumption is dropped in the theoretical analysis. The critical assumption is left-spherical symmetry for the distribution of the design matrix. Under those assumptions, the authors derived an accurate formula for the prediction error for ridgeless LSE with the high dimensional model and finite data set. Some numerical experiments show that the numerical results agree with the theoretical findings."

Notably, main results such as the ones presented in Theorems 3.2, 3.3, and Corollary 4.1 lack comprehensive elucidation, leaving it unclear how these outcomes relate to the core assertion regarding the benefits of overparameterization or unimportant parameters. Moreover, there are instances of imprecise writing, such as the reference issue in Section 4.2, where \"we can obtain a similar result with 4.1\" appears to be a misreference.\n\n\n====\n\nI acknowledge that I have considered the authors' response, yet after careful deliberation, I have chosen to maintain the current score."

The main interest of this work is that it addresses non i.i.d. regression errors. Notably the expected value of the estimator variance at finite $n<p$ is found to depend on the sum of the variances of the regression errors, ignoring the correlations between regression errors. As the bias of the estimator is independent of the regression errors, the prediction risk and the estimation risk exhibit the same behavior."

If that is the case, the nature of the contributions should be made clearer to stress that point.\n\n- It appears that while allowing dependences between regression errors, the proposed analysis in the ridgeless overparametrized setting shows that the performance stays the same whether or not the regression errors are independent,  as long as the sum of their variances is unchanged. The limitations of this work and the possible extensions should be better discussed in that regard. For instance, what would be the main technical difficulties to extend the analysis to ridge regularization and underparametrized regime, and would the dependences between regression errors have an impact on the learning performance in those settings?"
