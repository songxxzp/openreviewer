The primary goal in this work is to learn to sample (via diffusion) from a conditional distribution (given the finite space group) rather than an unconditional generation combined with E(n) equivariant networks. The authors do this by decomposing into two parts -  constraints based on an orthogonal group invariant exponential subspace and constraints of fractional coordinates. Subsequently, to tackle the crystal generation problem, the authors employ diffusion models to jointly generate the lattice, the fractional coordinates and atom types conditioned on the obtained constraints pertinent to the space group. The authors then present results on 4 different datasets, for two different tasks (crystal structure prediction and ab-initio crystal generation) where their model outperforms the compared baselines\n\n\nNote to AC: My lower confidence rating is because of lack of expertise with literature relevant to crystal generation."

Compares to other recent works, such as PGCGM (Zhao et al., 2023) which also incorporate the affine matrices of the space\ngroup as additional input into a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The big plus of DiffSCP++ is that it is more widely applicable without being constrained to ternary systems.\n4.
