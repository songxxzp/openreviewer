                "value": "The paper introduces TWOSOME, a novel finetuning method designed to ground Large Language Models (LLMs) in embodied environments. TWOSOME comprises three main components: action-selection, where the LLM identifies the best action from a list of actions on criteria such as likelihood, token normalization, and word normalization, LoRA updates and prompt design. The authors conducted empirical experiments using TWOSOME on four fine-tuning tasks within Overcooked/VirtualHome environments. Their results demonstrate that TWOSOME's word normalization component outperforms others. Moreover, the fine-tuned policies exhibit superior generalization to unseen tasks in zero-shot scenarios. Remarkably, TWOSOME's capabilities in NLP benchmarks remain unaffected after the fine-tuning process."

Could you add experiments on these points? \n\n- Paper mentions that (Carta et al, 2023) \u201cfocus on primitive actions in toy environments without rich semantics\u201c. I am not sure actions are primitive in (Carta et al, 2023) but rather semantically described actions, e.g. \u201cgo forward\u201d, \u201cturn left\u201d, \u201cdrop and toggle\u201d. What makes them more \u201cprimitive\u201d seems to be the environment they chose for experimenting (BabyAI vs Overcooked/VirtualHome). \n\n- Regarding the choice of environments. I am afraid there are too few fine-tuning tasks. I might be wrong, but the task generalization seems almost too-good from 4 tasks only. BabyAI was procedurally generated which would have enabled experimentation on more finetuning tasks."

Even though this paper proposes a promising direction towards fine-tuning a LLM agent with a RL algorithm, the main contribution seems rather marginal. The normalization method is about dividing the log probability of a varying length text-based action by the number of words (or the number of tokens). It seems to compensate a text action with larger number of words, but I am not sure that this kind of simple division is a proper way to normalize varying length text actions sampled from a LLM policy. \n \n- W2. This paper shows that TWOSOME can learn the optimal policy in a simple environment like Overcooked.
