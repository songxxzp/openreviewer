Can the authors explain more about this?\n- I read subsections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 carefully and realized that the reliability quantification and sampling (which I understand to be the core design of this paper) seem to be very similar to RKD. In my opinion, it's okay to extend designs of previous work to hypergraphs, but it's better to add proper citations and clarify which parts are similar and which parts are the main contributions of this paper.\n- Most of the datasets used in this paper are small, and the authors are encouraged to demonstrate effectiveness on more large-scale datasets.\n- Can the authors explain more about how the proposed method captures high-order correlations? I think more discussions on the differences between hypergraph KD and general graph KD can greatly enhance the readability and contribution of the paper.\n\n[1] Tian Y, Zhang C, Guo Z, et al.
