The weights are used to produce a scalar value (after an inner product with the output weight vector). This model is trained in a regularized regression manner and the produces features are evaluated in an acceptable feature selection evaluation pipeline using predictive strengths of the features as final evaluations. The approach is applied to a subset of the ABCD dataset."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1.  **The positioning of the paper is a problem.** The assertion that it captures high-order interaction is not substantiated, even though the feature selection model's entire motivation hinges on this claim. Certainly, the title emphasizes high-order interaction. However, the exact type of high-order interaction that the proposed model captures remains ambiguous. I would suggest considering the following papers, which were mistakenly overlooked. These papers seek to formally define what is being captured before attempting to estimate the interactions:\n    -   Rosas FE, Mediano PA, Gastpar M, Jensen HJ. [Quantifying high-order interdependencies via multivariate extensions of the mutual information](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.032305). Physical Review E. 2019 Sep 13;100(3):032305.\n    -   Varley TF, Pope M, Faskowitz J, Sporns O. [Multivariate information theory uncovers synergistic subsystems of the human cerebral cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-04843-w). Communications biology. 2023 Apr 24;6(1):451.\n    -   Santoro A, Battiston F, Petri G, Amico E. [Higher-order organization of multivariate time series](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01852-0). Nature Physics. 2023 Feb;19(2):221-9.\n2.  **The clarity of the writing, with regard to the implementation**, is also inadequate in other sections. If we are estimating a hypergraph, then the edges, or node clusters, should form a cover rather than a partition. However, the regularization of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) used in Equation 11, as well as a preceding statement, both confirm the need for the edges to be disjoint, thereby suggesting a partition. This leads us back to the issue of positioning as it means that what is proposed is a clustering algorithm or the task of finding a partition. It's worth noting that node partitioning can still be conducted to recover high-order interactions, as has been exemplified in the neural imaging context, for instance, here:\n    -   Plis SM, Sui J, Lane T, Roy S, Clark VP, Potluru VK, Huster RJ, Michael A, Sponheim SR, Weisend MP, Calhoun VD. [High-order interactions observed in multi-task intrinsic networks are dominant indicators of aberrant brain function in schizophrenia.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811913007970) NeuroImage. 2014 Nov 15;102:35-48.\n3.  Overall, **the approach feels like an ad hoc method** for grouping the feature vectors via their predictive potential for a dependent variable. Even the input features are correlation coefficients. That is, the initial input matrix for each subject is the correlation matrix of which the goal is to subselect rows (or columns, which is equivalent due to symmetry) into K different groups.\n4.  **Comparisons in Table 1 are highly problematic** as well.\n    1.  If the goal is to find high-order relations what does predictive quality of representations has to do with it? Table 1 in my opinion does not belong in a paper on high-order relations.\n    2.  However, if the paper would be rewritten to focus on feature grouping and clustering, this approach may potentially work although not without changes. In this case, the proposed model needs to be compared with other approaches that do clustering or partition of random variables. For example, it seems appropriate to consider comparison with Deep Clustering.\n5.  **Results are confusing.** They do not show individual \"hyperedges\" and analyze the ROIs that have grouped together and explain high-order interactions that grouped them. If the regularization enforces the partition, why are so many clusters overlap per my interpretation of Figures 5 and 4c?"

My comments below are to help future clarity of the work:\n\n1.  The abstract states that CRM measures quality of hyperedges, however, CRM looks like a feature selection protocol that also has recommendations for assessing predictivity of the features. This is a disconnect between what is claimed and what is presented.\n2.  The beginning of the second paragraph of the Introduction needs references to support the claim. The last phrase of that paragraph needs a rewrite \"of the intricate behind brain regions\"\n3.  Section 2.1 \"Inupt\" - Do you mean Input?\n4.  Section 2.2 describes feature selection - why is this tied to high-order interactions. Confusing.\n5.  Section 4.1 what do you mean by \"N-dimensional shallow embedding layer parameterized by\". It would be best if all operations and parameters were clearly defined. I assume this is a linear transformation but that is a guess.\n6.  Hyperedge weighting. MLP is not a sufficient description of the used model. Please also mention the activation function.\n7.  Baselines: \"standard\" method mentioned there is unclear. What is standard? How is it defined?\n8.  Why the model is compared with arbitrary models that solve problems different from the proposed method? How were models shown in the comparison selected?\n9.  Ktena, Li, and Kan papers do not construct hypergraphs and yet used as such in the paper for comparisons. Confusing.\n10. Consider fixing capitalization in your bib file.
