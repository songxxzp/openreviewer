The potential outcome, treatment and a new ideal loss are defined so as to include both the selection bias AND the neighborhood interference effect. Follow two new estimators to estimate the newly designed ideal loss: neighborhood inverse propensity score (N-IPS) and neighborhood doubly robust (N-DR)."

The N-DR estimator is derived similarly.  -Bias and variance of both estimators are computed with tail and generalization error bounds provided (Theorem 5). \n\nThen, it is shown how to estimate the propensity score for the joint effect of the treatment and the treatment representation vector for the neighboring effect.  \n\nThe approach is accompanied first with experiments on semi-synthetic data (based on MovieLens 100K) to: \n1) assess whether the proposed estimators provide a more accurate estimation for the ideal loss compared to the state-of-the-art methods when neighboring interference is observed.  \n2) measure the influence of the neighborhood effect strength on the estimation accuracy.\nOn the semi-synthetic dataset, for all interference strengths, N versions of DR or MRDR are giving better accuracy (lower relative error) than DR and MRDR but also are less harmed by the interference strength for 6 different methods of predicting the ratings.  \n\nReal-world experimentation is done on Coat, Yahoo!

Motivation is weak\n- why do we need to eliminate the neighborhood effect?\n- for example, existing recommenders can consider the neighborhood effect in the training phase and make recommendations with the neighborhood effect (e.g., similar users have similar embedding and thus get similar recommendations).\n- Therefore, the neighborhood effect can be a rich information source for model training.\n\n2. Assumptions are not realistic.\n- why $r_{u,i}$ is affected by $o_{u,i}$? In my opinion, $o_{u,i}$ is just a treatment to observe $r_{u,i}$, and does not affect the 'value' of  $r_{u,i}$. (i.e., the value of $r$ is affected only by $x$ and observed only when $o=1$).\n- If $r_{u,i}$ is affected by $o_{u,i}$, i think the assumption 3 is not hold.\n- In the paper, g is a scalar (a continuous variable), not a representation vector.\n\n3. Minor concerns\n- In the real-world experiment, the authors use 5% MAR test ratings for the propensity estimation. This process is unrealistic.\n- In the semi-synthetic experiment, the definition of neighborhood effect is the number of neighbor pairs with $o >= c$. what does it mean? Since $o \\in {0,1}$, i cannot understand the c is chosen to be the median of all $g$."
