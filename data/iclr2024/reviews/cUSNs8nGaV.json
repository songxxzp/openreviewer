I am concerned about the level of contribution of this work. Many of the conclusions of the paper are not novel. For example, people should already know \u201cHealthy subjects demonstrate markedly smaller errors\u201d and \u201cusing simpler shallow models when data is limited\u201d."

It also provides valuable insights into the factors affecting glucose prediction, including dataset size, patient populations, and time of day. It highlights the varying impact of covariates on model performance across different datasets.\n3) I believe the study follows rigorous principles of reproducibility, ensuring that results are consistent across different data splits and model re-runs.

Authors should discuss about the quality of the selected CGM datasets assessed, and what criteria were used to determine data quality.\n2) The paper discusses the impact of covariates on model performance. Can you provide insights into which specific covariates had the most influence on the predictions and whether their quality was uniform across all datasets? And, how does the decision to omit certain models due to their lack of support for covariates affect the overall model comparison?\n3) Perhaps authors should consider including, at least, in the supplemental material about any potential risks or challenges in directly applying the findings from the study to clinical settings especially when translated into practical clinical applications for healthcare providers and individuals with diabetes.\n4) The paper mentions not considering additional model-specific tuning for benchmark models. Could such optimizations significantly enhance the models' performance, and why were they excluded from the evaluation?\n5)  How diverse were the patient populations in the selected datasets in terms of demographics, disease severity, or other relevant factors, and how might this diversity affect the results and generalization?"
