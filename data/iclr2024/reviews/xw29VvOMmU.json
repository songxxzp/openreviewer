The authors motivate their problem by first discussing (along with appropriate references) that the conventional initialization scheme for LoRA, in which the first low-rank adapter is initialized as a Gaussian matrix, and the second low-rank factor is initialized to a zero-matrix, is suboptimal when fine-tuning a PTQ model. The initialization scheme proposed in this paper considers a low-rank + quantized decomposition of the LLM weight matrices. Subsequently, the low-rank factors are used as initializations for fine-tuning.\n\nMost of the paper discusses how to obtain this quantized + low-rank decomposition of the matrix. They do so using an alternating minimization algorithm, wherein the the low-rank component is obtained by computing the SVD of the error residual from the quantized matrix, and the quantized component is obtained by quantizing the error residual from just the low-rank component. This alternating algorithm is a heuristic, and it is terminated when the objective function value, i.e., the Frobenius norm error between the original matrix and its quantized + low-rank decomposition starts diverging (or is small enough).\n\nIn addition to this, the work also considers a dynamic bit allocation strategy across different layers, and formulate this problem as an Integer Linear Program. This is a constrained optimization problem, which minimizes the Frobenius norm reconstruction error subject to a total target bit rate. Moreover, they also propose a data-aware quantization strategy, wherein instead of treating each parameter weight equivalently, their sensitivity with respect to the loss function is evaluated using Fisher matrix, and an alternative objective function is minimized instead.\n\nThe authors convincingly do extensive numerical evaluations on several tasks, and identify that the predominant regime where their initialization provides benefits is where aggressive compression is required (eg., sub 4-bit quantization bit requirement per parameter)."

One of the contributions of this work is the ILP formulation for dynamic bit allocation across layers. This dynamic configuration of quantization parameters (e.g., bit-width, block size) subject to a total target memory budget is quite interesting. Hardware-wise, the proposed strategy necessitates mixed-precision compute (i.e., different bits for different layers). Even without the ILP, the $Q + L_1L_2$ decomposition requires handling $Q$ is low-precision format, whereas $L_1$ and $L_2$ is high (original)-precision format (eg., $16$-bit). Moreover, the ILP formulation outputs bit-budget allocation at quite fine resolutions like $2$ or $3$-bits. My concern is that such low precision is not easily available as current hardware primitives, i.e.,we can find a $4$ bit GPU, but can we find a $2$ bit GPU? I understand that the simulations are done in PyTorch that provide the flexibility of finer precisions (the authors also mention this on Page 5, \"Implementation\"). It would be worth discussing that this is a significant bottleneck in the deployment of this scheme for actual benefits in hardware. Please note again that I do not see this as a significant drawback of this paper, but it is important that the authors acknowledge this.\n\n2. There is a recent work on joint low-rank and quantized decomposition of a matrix:\n\n\"Matrix Compression via Randomized Low Rank and Low Precision Factorization\" (Saha, Srivastava & Pilanci) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11028)\n\nThis work derives Frobenius norm error bounds for the low-rank decomposition of a matrix, in which the low-rank factors are also quantized. LQ-LoRA considers the low-rank factors to be in high-precision. This work is complementary in the sense that the the low-rank factors of the LQ-LoRA decomposition can also be quantized (in case, the hardware is limited to low-precision only). This will also help in circumventing the mixed-precision hardware issue mentioned in point 1 above (i.e., now $W$, $L_1$, and $L_2$ -- all three can be in the same precision). The analyses techniques proposed in this work can also be used to upper bound the Frobenius norm error of LQ-LoRA in order to make it more theoretically principled."

Why did the authors choose NormalFloat instead of instead of a simple RTN quantization scheme? In principle, it seems that LQ-LoRA can be extended with any quantization scheme, if I'm not mistaken? And RTN has benefits over NF, such as no Gaussian modeling assumptions on the weights?\n\n3. Where does the value $\\delta = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{32}\\right)$ come from? Was it proposed in the NF paper? Does this value remain this same if more flexible quantization resolutions are considered (as is done in this paper in the ILP, but not probably in the NF paper)?\n\n4. Page 3: How is NF quantization **lossless**?\n\n5. In Fig. 1 (center), the weight matrices are just quantized using NF 3-bits, whereas on the right figure, a low-rank + quantized decomposition is obtained, where the quantization is again 3-bit. The caption says \"LQ decomposition results in less quantization error\". Is this a fair comparison in terms of the total memory requirement? Isn't it obvious that the right figure will have low error than center, since in the center, the residual from quantization error is approximated by a low-rank factorization in high-precision, whereas residual is not considered in the center?\n\n6. In Alg. 1 pseudocode -- Does $B$ denote the quantization budget or the total number of blocks (as used in the main text)?\n\n7.
