            "questions": {
                "value": "- could the authors explain the difference between defining energy functions for partial goals, negative goals, sequence goals, hybrid goals as they do in the bottom of page 3 and defining goal-related reward functions that do the same, as often done in GCRL? If they argue that this makes a difference, can they backup this claim with comparative experiments?\n\n- \"This way of defining a goal is fundamentally different from the conventional way of treating the goal as a variable\" -> could the authors explain why it is \"fundamentally different\"? You could have a goal represented with \"Clean = True\", this would be using a boolean variable, or \"clean level = X\", that would be using a scalar variable. Doesn't your energy function (c or g?) compute something similar?\n\n- p6: the list of examples should be reordered to match the order of the figure (or vice versa). Besides, the corresponding energy functions should be given. The examples themselves need to be better explained.\n\nFor instance \"our objective isn\u2019t state-specific but aims at maximizing or minimizing some certain property,\" this is a completely unspecific sentence, and an over-statement. Can your system do whatever you ask it to do? What are the limits?\n\n- in the related work, the authors connect training-free guidance to (Yu et al., 2023b): \"and training-free guidance (Yu et al., 2023b)\" But the paragraph where they speak of training-free guidance (p2) does not even mention (Yu et al., 2023b). This point must be explained more clearly, as it seems to be the central contribution of the paper.\n\n-could the authors extend the related work and better explain the difference betwen their work and Janner et al. (2022) and Liang et al. (2023)? Putting it before the experimental study would help, in my opinion.\n\n- Table 1: why is the authors' method performing worse than competitors in the medium dataset?\n\n- could the authors explain how they transformed language-based prompts into a goal-related energy function?\n\n\n- Appendix F, HER is not an executor function, it is a method to leverage failed trajectories in GCRL. I don't understand the authors' description at all, we clearly do not see HER the same way...\n\n\n## Over-statements:\n\n- p2: \"This work is a trial to approach the ultimate embodied AI that can assist people with diverse tasks such as healthcare, driving, and housework, though further endeavor is, of course, still largely demanded.\" So, is this work a successful trial? Clearly, it does not approach this ultimate embodied AI it describes. This is a huge over-statement, and the authors should describe in the introduction the goals they truly manage to achieve.\n\n- p5: \"By doing so, it expedites the sampling process and ensures adherence to defined objectives, proficiently fulfilling our requirements and presenting a viable resolution to our challenges\" -> only politicians write this way! :) Be concrete about the positive sides of your method, and do not be afraid of listing limitations, you are doing science, not selling something\n\n- p6: \"Fig. 4h exemplifies our algorithm\u2019s prowess\" -> sorry, I don't consider this as a prowess.\n\n- p7: This holds considerable significance for offline RL: what makes you believe this is so? Without properly backing up this claim with results, I see this as an over-statement.\n\n- \"Our work introduces a novel way of solving open-ended embodied tasks, which may shed light on cognitive neuroscientific research on understanding human intelligence (Taylor et al., 2016).\" -> This is a huge over-statement. Can the authors explain in which way they believe their work can concretely shed light on cognitive neuroscientific research on understanding human intelligence?\n\n\n## Local issues and typos ##\n\n- p2: These works are worthy of recognition on the path to embodied AI that can truly tackle open-ended tasks.\nDo the authors use \"task\" and \"goal\" interchangeably?\n\n- p2: from somewhere.). -> from somewhere).\n\n- Bayesian formula -> Bayes formula\n\n- p3, in (1) the energy function is written g, but in the examples below it is written c\n\n\n- \"Generative models such as diffusion models for image generation can \u201cdraw\u201d the pixels with any color, whereas a real-world painter can only use the colors available in the palette\". -> This makes no sense. How can a generative model draw an image with pixels outside the computer's palette?\n\n- \"This is different from traditional machine learning tasks, where the focus is on finding a single optimal output for a given input.\" -> By traditional, do you mean supervised learning? Reinforcement learning is traditional (rooted in Bellman, 1957) but it corresponds to what you describe in the previous sentence.\n\n- \"Oftentimes we care about multiple steps rather than a single state, e.g, asking a robot to move in circles. Therefore, tackling\nopen-ended task goals in embodied AI becomes challenging.\" -> this is very poorly written. Ask yourself what is your point and write what your point is, avoid being only allusive.\n\n- p3: dimension (Here -> here\n\n- discrete actions.) -> actions).\n\n- you don't need a \"nanny\" robot to clean or tidy a house, a anny is to take care about children.\n\n- p4: the task is achieve -> is to achieve\n\n- p5: concatate -> concatenate\n\n- p5: plan executing -> execution\n\n- p5: Several optional can be made for the plan executor -> there are several options...\nBy the way, these options should be described in the main text\n\n- p5: Since our executor to multiple-step actions, -> something is missing\n\n- p5: to the Appendix: which one?\n\n- p5: the generating policy consistent with D4RL: what do you mean? I don't understand.\n\n- p6: we present 100 episodes both from the same start point (marked as green star). -> why \"both\"?

Based on table 1, we can see that AdaptDiffuser and the proposed method have the same performance. In addition, it is unclear to me how the proposed model can combine GPT to process the natural language instruction to generate the trajectory (in Figure 6). As a result, the method is not convincing.\n3. The paper says that it wants to solve \"open-ended\" problem, but in reality, the method is constrained to solve a fixed set of the problem, and there is no notion of unseen environment, making it hard to evaluate that if the proposed method can truly solve the open-ended questions.\n4.
