The core insight is that tensors of type $i$ with $i = kj + r$ ($i > j > 0$) can be obtained by taking $T_j^{\\otimes k} \\otimes T_1^{\\otimes r}$. In this way, higher-order tensors can be constructed from lower-order tensors and mixing is then done through linear layers. Further, scalars (type-0 tensors, invariants) can further interact nonlinearly with the higher-order tensors. This efficient architecture is tested on several experiments including synthetic experiments from Finzi et al. (2021), image classification, PDE solving, $n$-body dynamics, and equivariant fine-tuning. Results show competitive performances using a lower computational budget."

Inspecting the appendix, I noted that the authors repeat images four times in 90-degree rotations. However, isn't this a different way of achieving equivariance compared to what the main method proposes? The main method combines tensors of different types linearly and then nonlinearly using equivariant nonlinearities, but I don't see how that is used in the image case. Similarly for the FNO comparison.\n* What do the equivariant layers exactly look like. Could you write down what the conversion layers and linear layers comprise mathematically?\n* How is equivariance achieved for the image experiments? Could you provide more details into your architectures, experimental setup, and so on?\n* Why do $N$ tensors lead to $N^2$ invariants?\n* Could you discuss the limitations of your method? Does it replace all tensor-based methods or does it have specific use-cases? Is it as expressive as previous methods? It seems that there are no bilinear operations (e.g., tensor products) in your architectures, is that a problem?\n* The authors bolden their numbers even though some method might be better than theirs but uses a more sophisticated technique. E.g., for G-FNO in Table 3. Instead, I would also provide the forward/backward times and include a comparison on that level, as efficiency is a core part of the method. \n* Why does the number of data-points in your synthetic experiments not extend beyond $~1000$? In Finzi et al., settings up to 30 000 datapoints are considered."

Even the proof of equivariance carries over almost directly.\n* Even though the architecture is quite general, the authors use ad-hoc methods for designing the architectures in the experiments and rely on previously obtained models for symmetric data such as convolution for images and message passing for graphs. It might be worth mentioning that, in principle, all models in the paper could have followed the exact same blueprint (with a possible drop in performance). For example, the translation symmetry of images and the permutation symmetry of graphs could all have been handled under the GRepsNet architecture. The paper could be more clear in describing which sub-symmetries are being handled by their model.\n* The work shouldn't be compared to EMLP (Finzi et al.). As I've mentioned, comparing to vector neurons is much more appropriate. What EMLP does is that it computes *all* equivariant bases, which is much more challenging than providing *some* equivariant bases, as in this work. EMLP is a valid baseline of comparison in experiments, but the goal of that paper is different from this one.\n* For the image experiments there should be a comparison with group convolutional networks (Cohen & Welling)."
