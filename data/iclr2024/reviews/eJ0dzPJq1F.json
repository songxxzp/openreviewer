The method extends the MAMBA algorithm [1] by incorporating the learner policy into the set of oracles and using uncertainty-aware value-estimates to define the exploration strategy and advantage estimator. These changes enable the proposed method to behave like an RL algorithm in cases where the oracles do not provide beneficial supervision. The proposed method achieves good results in mujoco and meta-world tasks, beating most of the oracle policies and baselines."

These are also issues with soundness of the paper.\n    - The necessary details for understanding equation (12) are not clearly presented. See questions.\n    - The value ensemble is central to the proposed method, yet there are only two sentences at the bottom of page 5 discussing how the value ensemble is trained.\n- The theory section borrows from MAMBA, which is only natural since these methods are closely related, but it would have been clearer to emphasize the points of departure from MAMBA more and perhaps move the parts that are more closely shared to the appendix.\n- Nitpick:\n    - The definition of policy gradient with advantage is cited for Schulman, but there are prior works considering policy gradients with advantage estimation, e.g., [2].\n    - The abstract mentions real-world scenarios but the paper does not talk about them.\n\n\n\n## Soundness\n- Computing the update requires evaluating the value ensembles for all of the oracles. Compared to normal RL algorithm, e.g., PPO, this means number of oracles times the size of ensemble more forward passes. Depending on the number of oracles and ensemble members, this may equate to a lot more expensive loss evaluation. In addition to the missing details about the ensemble size and number of oracles, it would be good to include some wall-time comparisons between the different methods.\n\n## Experimental evaluation\n- Cartpole is a bit too easy environment for the otherwise well-executed ablation study.\n- In the appendix, it says that the value ensembles are pre-trained before the main loop starts. That sounds like the proposed method uses more samples (and more compute) than the baselines. This should be mentioned in the main paper and discussed as a limitation.\n\n## Summary\nThe proposed method seems to do well, but the paper is missing too many details and is too hard to follow at parts that it is hard to evaluate whether the contribution is impactful or not. I think including a thorough discussion about the relationship of the proposed method and MAMBA as well as limitations would go a long way to make this easier to understand. Additionally, adding all of the missing details that I have listed here and in the questions would help."

Building frameworks that can blend between existing knowledge via oracles and exploration using a learners policy seems like a good way to enhance the setting of only learning from oracles.\n\nStructural clarity\n* The paper is well structured and well written. The flow is very clear. I do have to say that I did get lost in the notation details at times because there is a lot of notation that is quite similar. The switch from theoretical analysis to empirical investigation is handled nicely in the text.\n\nMathematical rigor\n* The work uses strict mathematical definitions and states its assumptions clearly. The proof for proposition 4.5 is intuitive. I did not carefully check the proof of proposition 5.1 in the Appendix. However, it seems reasonable that an online no-regret learning algorithm would obtain high value.\n\nNovelty\n* The work provides a sufficiently novel version of an existing algorithm that enables a mixture of online and offline optimization. Some of the novelty might be slightly exaggerated though and could be made more clear, see Weakness: Contextualization with prior work).\n\nExperimental evaluation\n* The experiments consider a sufficient number of environments and baselines and all evaluation is done over a reasonable number of random seeds. Ablations give insight into the behavior of the algorithm and provide intuition that the algorithm works as intended."

                "value": "Contextualization with prior work  \nBefore I start, I would like to mention that I am not familiar with this sub-field of RL but do know the standard online and offline RL literature quite well.\n* The prior work section is rather brief with a total of 6 citations. I am not familiar with the exact sub-field but this seems rather little given the literature is several years old.\n* My first main concern is related to the contextualization of various parts of the paper to previous work. I think it could be made clearer which parts are inspired by previous work. For instance, the ideas of UCB value selection and multi-step advantage over several value functions seem already present in previous work but this is not immediately apparent from the current manuscript. I understand that the present manuscript defines these things with the inclusion of an additional learner policy, which requires the development of novel machinery. However, I think it would be good to give credit to the general formulations in previous work where appropriate.\n\nExperimental evaluation\n* My second main concern is the following. The experimental setting seems very similar to that studied in Liu et al., since environments and baselines are relatively similar. However, it seems that the performance of the reported baselines in this paper differs significantly from the performance reported in the previous study of MAPS. Both MAPS and MAMBA seem to be unable to even achieve performance close to the best oracle while in the MAPS paper both algorithms perform significantly better on the tasks that seem to be identical to the ones chosen here. See Q6.\n\nTextual clarity suggestions\n* This might be a me thing but the term robust policy gradient has been used several times in the literature before. It might make sense to consider a less generic name for the algorithm. Examples:\n\nXuezhou Zhang et al. Robust Policy Gradient against Strong Data Corruption. ICML 2021.\nYue Wang and Shaofeng Zou. Policy Gradient Method For Robust Reinforcement Learning. ICML 2022.\n\n* I\u2019m being a little nitpicky here but the policy gradient theorem with baseline is definitely older than 2015 (P6 section 6.2). It might be good to cite relevant prior work here.\n* Some of the notation can be quite confusing and I lost track of what index refers to which object several times. This is mostly because lot\u2019s of variables are indexed by multiple things but all objects are somewhat similar. I don\u2019t really have a good suggestion on how to fix this though other than reducing the size of separate, less relevant sections.\n\nOverall, I do think that the community will benefit from the publication of this work. I am inclined to raise my score if my two main concerns can be addressed."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Q1. What is the relationship between the studied setting and offline RL? Offline RL, similar to the studied setting, tries to blend behavioral cloning with value function learning. In that sense, is any offline RL algorithm a candidate for learning from multiple experts? I\u2019m not claiming that offline RL needs to be added in prior work if it turns out to be unfitting but it would be great if the authors could elaborate on this point.\n\nQ2. Does the max-following policy execute a mixture over policies or does it, given a state, fix a policy and then execute this policy throughout time? This sentence is slightly confusing me here: \u201cSpecifically, if all oracles perform worse than the learner policy at a given state, the max-following policy will still naively imitate the best (but poor) oracle.\u201d If the former is true, then it would be better or equal to the best poor oracle.\n\nQ3. I\u2019m confused about Line 5 of the algorithm. $D^k$ contains data from possibly two different policies, however it is used to update a single value function. Is this a typo or am I misunderstanding the algorithm here? I would think this should only be taking the second portion of the roll-out data, not the roll-in data. Could you elaborate why this is okay to do?\n\nQ4. In the policy selection step, the text states \u201cUsing LCB for the learner encourages exploration unless we are very sure that the learner surpasses all oracles for the given state\u201d. What exactly does the term exploration refer to here? Is this just meant as exploration for the learner\u2019s policy?\n\nQ5. To clarify that I am understanding this correctly. In Eq 14, the gradient is computed with respect to the learner\u2019s actor policy, but with the overall multi-step advantage from the collection of value functions correct? I\u2019m not 100% sure that I understand why this is okay since $\\hat{f}^+(s_{t+1})$ and $\\hat{f}^+(s_{t})$ can be from different policies, right? My guess is that it is fine because they are both independent of the action but I would appreciate some clarification.\n\nQ6. Did you use the original implementations for MAPS and MAMBA or did you reimplement the methods? Do you have an intuition why in the present comparisons these methods perform significantly worse than in the previous literature?"
