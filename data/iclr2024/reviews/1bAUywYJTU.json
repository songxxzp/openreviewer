The proposed method shows much faster convergence speed than its random time schedule counterpart, and generates results with more geometric and textural details."

The paper motivates the method with an easy-to-understand analysis (Section 3.2) and good illustrations (Figure 3, Figure 6).\n\n3.

                "value": "Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models, trained on vast amounts of image-text pairs, have paved the way for 3D content creation by optimizing an initially random differentiable 3D representation using score distillation. Despite its promise, the method has substantial drawbacks: a prolonged optimization convergence and subpar 3D model outcomes in terms of both quality (e.g., distorted features and textures) and diversity, especially when juxtaposed with text-guided image synthesis. This paper pinpoints the crux of the problem in the misalignment between the 3D optimization and the uniform timestep sampling in score distillation. A novel approach is introduced that reprioritizes timestep sampling using monotonically non-increasing functions, seamlessly integrating the 3D optimization and diffusion model sampling. Comprehensive experiments validate the efficacy of this redesign, showcasing marked improvements in convergence speed, model quality, and diversity."

Occasionally, there might be a scenario where we initialize the neural implicit fields with a rudimentary object. How would the training process evolve in such instances?\n\nThe paper posits its objective as refining a differentiable 3D representation by leveraging knowledge distilled from either the pre-trained Stable Diffusion or Zero123, depending on whether the prompt is text or image-based. Could you clarify which outcomes are derived from the SDS loss in tandem with the pre-trained Stable Diffusion and which with Zero123? Additionally, I seem unable to locate results corresponding to image inputs.\n\nWhile Fig.2 highlights issues of blurriness and color distortion associated with the SDS loss in the context of texture generation, it appears that this paper falls short of presenting compelling evidence to demonstrate that the introduced method effectively addresses both challenges.\n\nMissing citations for AvatarCraft: Transforming Text into Neural Human Avatars with Parameterized Shape and Pose Control, which produces human avatars with SDS guidance.
