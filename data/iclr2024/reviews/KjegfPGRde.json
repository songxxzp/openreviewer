Can the authors visualize the learned A and B matrices to explain why DePT is better than Prompt tuning?\n- the tasks used in experiments are too simple; better to try more challenging tasks, like GeoQuery (Zelle & Mooney, 1996), NL2Bash (Lin et al., 2018), WebQS (Berant et al., 2013). \n- datasets in GLUE and SuperGLUE are sensitive to hyperparameters. What are the hyperparameters for each dataset?\n-  In Table 3, DePT is much worse than FT on VQA, but can perform better on MSCOCO; why?\n- how to initialize the soft prompt in prompt tuning? Usually, they can be initialized randomly or use the embeddings of label tokens."

But, unlike LoRA, DEPT still suffers from prompt length compared to architectures at inference time. While DEPT can also achieve the same inference speed as the base model, like LoRA, when the prompt length is 0, in Figure 3, we see that the performance is about 20 points below the DEPT performance reported in Table 1. Furthermore, decomposing the prompts does not offer any conceptual understanding or insight into the learned prompts. \n\n**Experiments with only smaller models (<1B model parameters).**\nAll experiments in the main paper are conducted on smaller models which hurt the technical contribution of the work. The paper presents improved results over several parameter-efficient methods, by a small margin, on models that have less than 1 billion parameters. The authors have included results of Llama2 in Appendix B but show improvements over prompt tuning on only one dataset (SST-2). It would be of interest to the community to know if the work is applicable to larger models say T5-XL, T5-XXL, or Llama2 on more datasets.\n \n**Missing experiments.**\nI noticed that the authors do not include results on SuperGLUE for LoRA in Table 1. Since the results for DEPT and LoRA are so close on GLUE, I would be curious to see how close the results are on SuperGLUE. \n\n**Suggestions.**\n- Related work: The title of your work is similar to the below papers [a,b] but the proposed work differs. You could choose to cite them and clarify the differences in the next version of the paper. \n- Move the 3.3 #2 (DEPT grows more efficient with model size increases) to the Appendix and move Llama2 to the main paper as it is obvious that the inference time will improve with model parameter size. The Llama2 results, on the other hand, are more interesting.\n- For completeness, it would be great if the authors could include the GPT-2 results in the Appendix on GLUE and SuperGLUE.

Through experiments with both language models and vision-language models across various tasks, the authors find that DePT can achieve advantageous performance while saving approximately 20% memory cost."

This is important because the LORA method is the closet peft method on the glue benchmark however it is missing when looking at Superglue. Similarly, Table 2 should have LoRA as a baseline.\n\nQ: IA3 is a recent PEFT method that is very parameter efficient and is missing from the baseline comparison. It is a crucial baseline, especially in the case of the few-shot adaptation. It should be added at least to Tables 4 and 5 and adding it to Tables 1-2 would also be good.\n\n\n\n**Other Questions**\n\nQ: Most of the improvement in the table-1 glue task seems to come from 1-2 tasks like cola, rte any specific reason for this?\n\n\nNote for other reviewers and AC: I am not sure of the related work section, there might be some relevant prompting-related baselines that I am not aware of."
