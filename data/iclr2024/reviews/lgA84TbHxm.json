                "value": "1) The paper lacks explanations of key concepts. For example, to understand this paper, it is important to understand what FN, PN, and TP mean, but the paper does not kindly define each of them.\n2) Some experimental results are omitted. For example, the paper states in the second paragraph of page 4 that it was inspired by the EMD ratio of TN and FN, but the experimental results are not reported.\n3) There are some coarse parts of the notation. For example, the sample index is written as a superscript in equation 5, but not in other equations. In addition, p^(i\u2193j)+p^(ij\u2193) seems to be a typo of p^(i\u2193j)+p^(j\u2193i). In addition, \u2202L/(\u2202s_ij )>0=\u03b4 in equation 7 should be changed to \u2202L/(\u2202s_ij )=\u03b4>0.\n4) The theoretical analysis seems a bit strange. First, the proposition contains information about the slope of the temperature function, but this is not a mathematically proven fact, but just about the idea of the proposed algorithm. In addition, the author's claim that \u2202L/(\u2202s_ij ) in equation 8 is always negative is suspicious.\n5) Originally, only one temperature hyperparameter needs to be tuned for existing contrastive learning, but the proposed DySTress has more hyperparameters (\u03c4_min,\u03c4_max,\u0394_s,k) as a result, and it can be seen from Table 6 that the performance of DySTress is sensitive to the values of hyperparameters."

However, could DySTreSS hinder the proper repulsoin from those TNs, thereby accumulating noises and aggravating overfitting?\n2) Why is the temperature scaling function used in the main text different from the temperature scaling function obtained from the ODE solution in the appendix? And why was the function in Algorithm 1 chosen as the temperature scaling function among several candidates? Are there any comparison experiments with other temperature scaling functions?\n3) In the Experimental Results section, the proposed method seems to have been carefully tuned for optimal performance w,r,t tge hyperparameters (\u0394_s,k, etc.). Were the hyperparameters for the other baseline methods also tuned in a fair manner?\n4) Cosine similarity is high for hard negative samples, so it makes sense to give them a high temperature to reduce their weight. However, why do we need to increase the temperature for easy negative samples with low cosine similarity? I think a monotonically increasing temperature function would make more sense. Are there any experiments with this?"

However, class itself, it a very vague and \"human-biased\"  term. For example, in imagenet, there are many classes that look very like each other, in this case, would it be ideal to have minimum intraclass scattering? In that case, would it be what's known as the neural collapse in supervised training? So, would that be an \"ideal\" representation we truly need? I think the motivation here needs to be very carefully explained and justified. \n\n2. In Algo1, s_ij is defined as the cosine sim of the pair (x_i, x_j).  If x_i and x_j are images, do we flatten them and compute the cosine sim? Or do we compute the cosine similarity differently? in the latent space?\n\n3. If we go back to the motivation, would the proposing method giving us better representation? Visually? Is the method learning representation with more intra distance and less inter distance?\n\n4. Does the method incur extra training cost? If so, how does it compare with the gain in performance?
