The proposed attention uses a multi-resolution approach. It uses high resolution to approximate the  query\u2019s attention to nearby tokens, low resolution to approximate the attention to distant tokens, and even lower resolution for even farther tokens. The authors evaluated the method on autoregressive and bidirectional language models and found better accuracy and better efficiency compared to some efficient attention baselines."

Unlike sparse attention variants, due to the use of multiple resolutions, the proposed attention provides a global receptive field to the entire sequence as well as efficiency benefits. \n\n3. This efficient self-attention supports causal attentions. This is most useful for the recently popular large language models (LLM) since most of them are auto-regressive models."

For example, MRA attention [1] also provides a multi-resolution approximation of self-attention. Also, since the proposed method is an approximation to the full self-attention matrix, it would be better to compare the approximation quality of the proposed method with other approximation baselines. \n\n2. Error analysis in 3.6 only analyzes the error between $QK^\\top$ and $Q\\tilde{K}^\\top$, which is too rudimentary. How does the approximation impact the final output of self-attention? \n\n3. Experiments are only performed on 512, 1K, and 2K sequence lengths, which are not very long. Full self-attention also performs efficiently on these sequence lengths (based on my knowledge and the efficiency comparison on Figure 3). The efficiency benefits of efficient attentions are very limited on these sequence lengths. The authors should evaluate the methods on longer sequences. \n\n4. No performance comparison to full self-attention on Table 1 and Table 2. Fused full self-attention (such as Flash Attention [2]) is integrated to PyTorch 2. The authors should give a performance and efficiency comparison to the full self-attention. \n\n5. On efficiency comparison, the batch size is 1, so compute load is small. In this case, kernel launch latency and memory latency might account for a large portion of the overall latency. Custom CUDA kernels usually have some advantages on these latency due to fused operations. It would be more convincing to provide latency for large batch size. \n\n[1] Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA) for Approximate Self-Attention https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10284\n\n[2] FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135"

How would vanilla transformer and FMA compare at those sizes?\n\nAnother quite significant omission is the lack of any ablations. The method has several hyper parameters that change from experiment to experiment. There is absolutely no ablation study to provide some insight on the effect of group size m and the number of levels to the performance as well as the FLOPS and memory required."
