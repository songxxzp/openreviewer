This allows the use of a new lexicographically ordered arm filter instead of the chain relation proposed in the prior work and, under the assumptions of the current work, yields new regret bounds."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) It is not true that $R^i(T)$ is more stringent than $\\hat{R}^i(T)$. For instance, let $\\theta^1=(1,0)$, $\\theta^2=(0,1)$, $x_A=(0,0)$, $x_B=(-1,1)$. In this case, $x_A$ is the lexicographic optimal arm. For a policy that always plays arm $x_B$, the $T$ round regrets are $R^1=T$, $R^2=-T$ and $\\hat{R}^1=T$, $\\hat{R}^2=0$. For his policy, the priority-based regret is greater than the general regret. It is also the case that priority-based regret should be harder to optimize than general regret since for the former, the lower bound is $\\Omega(T^{2/3})$, while for the latter, this paper shows upper bounds of $\\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ (but with dependence on $\\lambda$ which seems to be problem-dependent).\n\n2) Huyuk & Tekin (2021) also consider MOMAB under lexicographic ordering. They consider both priority-based regret, which is given in Equation 1, and general regret, which is given in Equation 4 (they call it priority-free regret). They have a lower bound on the priority-based regret, which is $\\Omega(T^{2/3})$. This shows that MOMAB under lexicographic ordering with priority-based regret is harder than single-objective MAB for which $\\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ upper bounds are possible. Therefore, the claim in the introduction saying that \u201cprior work has proposed a suboptimal algorithm since the optimal regret bound for the existing single objective MAB algorithms is $O(K \\log T)$\u201d is incorrect. \n\n3) From an algorithmic point of view, this paper provides novel techniques. However, the discussion with the prior work confuses the reader. There are some notable differences between the prior work and this work. The authors briefly mention that their $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ high-probability upper bounds do not contradict the $\\Omega(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on the expected regret in the remark after Theorem 2. The authors justify this by saying that they focus on the pseudo-regret instead of the expected regret. I think that something is missing from the key comparison with the prior work. The proposed regret bounds are not instance-independent as they are given in terms of $\\lambda$, an important parameter that represents the tradeoffs between different objectives. Utilizing this prior knowledge is crucial in achieving the time order of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$. One would expect that if the problem instance is adversarially chosen, then the algorithm proposed in the current work will not be able to achieve the claimed $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ upper bounds. For instance, given a bound on the $l_2$ norm of the true parameter vectors and $T$-round decision sets, can\u2019t an adversary choose the true parameter vectors and decision sets such that lambda becomes a function of $T$? For the worst choice of lambda what will be the upper bounds? \n\n4) Related to the above question, consider the same $\\theta$ values in my first example, and let $x_A = (1+\\epsilon, 0)$, $\\epsilon>0$ and $x_B = (1,1)$. Clearly, $x_A$ is the lexicographic optimal arm. For these arms, Equation 5 in the paper gives $1 \\leq \\lambda \\epsilon$. Thus $\\lambda \\geq 1/\\epsilon$. Let $\\epsilon = T^{-1/3}$. According to Theorem 2, $R^2(T)$ of MTE$^2$LO becomes $\\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$. One should be able to construct similar examples for the case with more than two objectives. When the number of objectives increases, I expect the time order of the regret upper bound to get even worse since $i$th objective\u2019s time order depends on $\\lambda^{i-1}$.\n\n5) Based on the above discussion, the justification that the regret bounds are order-optimal because the scalar linear contextual bandit has a regret lower bound of $\\Omega(d \\sqrt{T})$ is unclear. Nearly matching upper bounds of algorithms such as LinUCB are minimax. Other than time and dimension of the feature vectors, the bounds only depend on upper bounds on the $l_2$ norms of the parameter and action vectors. It is unclear if the claim at Equation 5 is satisfied under the mild assumptions required to derive the $\\tilde{O} (d \\sqrt{T})$ for the scalar case (which seems not possible, based on the counter-example above)."

Further the theorem's mentioned in the paper do not talk about the finiteness or infinite decision set $\\mathcal{D}$, if the decision set is finite then the algorithm needs to be compared with that of SupLinUCB regret bounds, and if the decision set is infinite the how is it even possible to filter the arms based on chain relations?\n\n3.

This compared to the current regret bound in this paper $\\mathcal{O}((\\sum_{i}\\lambda^i)d\\sqrt{T})$ isn't clear to be a guaranteed improvement at first glance. I am willing to be completely wrong about this point. \n\n2. **Intuition and necessity of $\\lambda^i$**: Firstly, the paper keeps referencing $\\lambda$ when technically it is $\\lambda^i$ for each objective (please correct me if this is not the case). Secondly, $\\lambda^i$ serves to establish some sort of regularity between the different objectives. I fail to see the need or necessity of doing so. If this is utterly needed, can you provide a counter-example of things going completely haywire in the absence of such regularity condition?\n\nPersonally, I am just confused about the need for such a regularity. Hope the authors can shed some light on this. \n\n3. **Simulations**: Is it possible to perform a simulation on a real-world dataset? Another query is that the plot appears too linear for all the algorithms even with 10000 steps. Can you either run the algorithms for longer or showcase a smaller setup where the sublinear part of the curve is visible?\n\nWhile these are the major concerns. I am completely ready to be proven wrong and will gladly increase my score based on the author's comments."
