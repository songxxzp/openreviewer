Even more, the method not only improves, but it also performs \"extremely strong\" and \"exceptionally strong\".  \nThese are some exceptionally strong statements given the actual performance.  \n\nFocusing on each of the experiments in turn. The first problem is the presentation, e.g., what does a bold number mean (see question below)?\n\n_Regression Experiments._ Of \nthe six data sets (see question below on this number) the proposal improves on two, slightly on one, equally on two (although better than neural net-based baselines), and worse than most of its baselines in the final one. Calling this \"strong performance\" is rather misleading. Two additional, though potentially minor, problems are that all of the baselines are simply cited from prior work (Watson et al., 2021). Given the wide performance variations between different train/test splits that can be observed for various UCI data sets the results are not entirely trustworthy. (Note that the reported error intervals are most likely standard errors, as is common on UCI, instead of standard deviations. But which they are is never specified.)\nSecondly, the authors acknowledge in the appendix that there might be differences in the way the training data is normalized compared to the cited results. \n(Whether these problems strongly influence the results, or bias them in favor or against VBLL is unclear.)   \n\n_Classification._\nWhile \"Extremely strong accuracy results\" are mentioned, it just performs as well or worse than competitive baselines like Laplace or Ensembles. The same for ECE, NLL, OOD detection.  where \"exceptionally strong performance\" is claimed.\n\nThe method is somewhat simpler than baselines, but it lacks a convincing argument for why this should matter. As the authors advertise this simplicity, there should be additional results on practical runtime improvements compared to the baselines to provide some evidence for the claim that a reader should use this approach. \n\n### Minor\n- Dropout is first claimed to have a \"substantially higher computational cost\" (Sec 1) and appears later as a \"comparatively inexpensive\" method (Sec 4).  Additional forward passes at test time are indeed rather inexpensive instead of a high computational cost.\n- When submitting to ICLR please make sure that you follow the ICLR style guide. E.g., Table captions belong above tables, not below.\n\n### Typos\n- Sec 5.2 first par: \"We refer to this model **as** G-VBLL-MAP...\"\n- (6): $y|\\rho$"

E.g., in Energy RMSE a huge range of means is bold (from 0.39 to 0.47), but 0.43 is missing;  CIFAR-100 AUC has the same pattern, huge range, some missing, etc. \n- (very minor) What is the irony in BLL methods being popular (Sec 2.4)?"

I have not checked every citation, but it appears to me that this statement is false for at least a subset of the cited papers. It might be good to revise the exposition.\n2. Eq 12 is some weighted ELBO, weighted with T for the purpose of generality, according to the authors. However, T never seems to be used later and makes the connection to the common ELBO less transparent. I believe the paper would improve in clarity if T is dropped.\n3. Section 3.4 is very dense and it could help the reader if this section is improved in its presentation. \n4. For the experiments, I would have expected assessments under distributional shift, a comparison to recent deterministic approaches (e.g., Zeng et al 2023 or Dhawan et al 2023), and a large-scale application of the approach as it acts on the last-layer only and should be applicable in more realistic scenarios (e.g., ImageNet).\n\n\nMinor:\n- Page 3, Eq 11 cites \"Harrison et al 2018\", which I looked up but didn't find any relevant content that would discuss the use of the marginal in Bayesian deep learning as a standard objective.

In large-scale applications, this is a particularly relevant setting and the proposed method could be a promising plug-in replacement.\n3. From what I understand T is never actually used.
