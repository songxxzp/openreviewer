The convergence results on uniqueness sets are sufficiently deep for publication at a venue like ICLR. \nClarity: The article is written moderately clearly, but is presented in a very dense manner."

I think the paper by Aldous (1981) and Hoover (1979) are classical references that should be cited/acknowledged in studies discussing graphons. \n\n- One potential limitation of the graphon sampling approach is that many real life graphs are sparse, but graphons can only be reasonably motivated by dense graphs. Obviously, this is not a short coming of this research (since it is an open problem), but I think it would be reasonable for the authors to mention this explicitly in their paper to provide a comprehensive/balanced perspective."

It is not clear how robust the constructed uniqueness sets are to violations of perfect bandlimitedness. For instance, if a signal is only approximately bandlimited w.r.t. some cutoff frequency $\\lambda$, I would hope that a reconstruction of that signal using a uniqueness set for $\\lambda$ would be stable."

My question, then, is how is the Laplacian understood to act on $X$ when $X$ is not a signal in $L^2(D)$, but rather $L^2(S)$. Is there a canonical inclusion $L^2(S)$ in $L^2(D)$ that I am missing here? Please clarify the statement of Theorem 2. Could you please provide a comment on Point 2 in the weaknesses section above? In particular, I would like to see further justification for applying methods based on signal bandlimitedness to the datasets used in Section 6. It is not obvious to me if these signals are bandlimited, in which case I have no reason to believe that the uniqueness sets yield stable representations of the signals."
