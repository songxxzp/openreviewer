Moreover, this paper presents a learnable kernel spatially augmented with features for feature aggregations, mitigating distortions at places with drastically varying geometries.

An existing point-based method is PointNeRF, which is a per-scene optimization method.\nSection F.1 discusses the comparison between GPF and PointNeRF, which is helpful. What does the entry \"Ours\" represent in the table below Figure 17? If it refers to the model after fine-tuning, what are the results without fine-tuning?\n\nUpon closer examination of the comparison with PointNeRF, this paper states that the improvement is attributed to hierarchical fine-tuning strategies. I am wondering about the runtime required for fine-tuning. PointNeRF can be optimized from scratch in approximately 40 minutes. Additionally, is pretraining of the generalizable NeRF necessary? It seems that the primary advantage of this method over PointNeRF lies in its superior fine-tuning strategy.\n\nThe log sampling strategy is simply a handcrafted sampling distribution around the surface, which may not be considered a significant technical contribution. This strategy can only be applied if the depth prior is known.\n\nIt is important to discuss the comparison between the proposed method and the recently introduced efficient Gaussian-splatting representation. What are the advantages of the proposed method?"
