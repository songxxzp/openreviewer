In contrast to previous approaches, which enforce these constraints via loss functions, the approach proposed here achieves this via construction. Additionally, the paper uses a multi-resolution feature representation for image registration. The approach is evaluated on the tasks of inter-subject brain MR registration, evaluated on the LPBA40 and Oasis datasets."

Indeed, the authors acknowledge this by stating that a similar approach has been used in recent registration methods (Estienne et al., 2021; Young et al., 2022). The multi-resolution formulation proposed in section 3.2 seems rather natural (also in the symmetric setting), so I am unclear on how this is different from standard multi-resolution formulations, which are ubiquitous in image registration settings. \n\nThe evaluation of the registration accuracy is limited to the assessment of Dice overlap and Hausdorff distance after registration. It would have been good if the authors had used some additional non-brain datasets which have landmarks (e.g. lung CT images from the EMPIRE10 challenge) and thus allow the calculation of quantities such as the target registration error. Furthermore, the improvements in registration accuracy seem rather than marginal. No visual examples of the registrations are provided."

How is this different from the traditional multi-resolution (except the symmetric formulation)?\n- Can you comment on the significance of the improvement of the registration results?\n- The advantage of symmetry and inverse consistency over loss-based approaches is not clear, as all methods seem to provide symmetric and inverse consistent registrations apart from numerical accuracy. Can you comment on this?"

Unlike what is stated in the paper, the LDDMM method has been used in deep learning, such as DeepFlash[1], NODEO[2], R2Net[3], etc. Also, the inverse consistency by construction using multistep deep registration [4], which is quite close to this paper, is missing in the related work and experimental comparison. \n\n[1] Wang and Zhang, DeepFLASH: An Efficient Network for Learning-based Medical Image Registration, CVPR 2020. \n[2] Wu et al., Nodeo: A neural ordinary differential equation based optimization framework for deformable image registration, CVPR 2022. \n[3] Joshi and Hong, R2Net: Efficient and flexible diffeomorphic image registration using Lipschitz continuous residual networks, Medical Image Analysis, 2023. \n[4] Greer et al., Inverse Consistency by Construction for Multistep Deep Registration, MICCAI 2023. \n\n2. Unclear presentation with unexplained statements. Such as, 1) \"However, SYMNet does not guarantee symmetricity by construct\", why? How to draw this conclusion? 2) Denoting the feature extraction network by h, how is this feature extraction network designed? Do we need to pretrain it or train together with the following network? 3) Squaring and scaling are not enough to guarantee the diffeomorphic property of deformations, we need an additional loss term or strategies to enforce the smoothness of the initial velocity fields first. However, this paper uses the same loss term on the smoothness of deformations in non-diff VoxelMorph, is it a reasonable choice? \n\n3. Insufficient experimental results. This paper should compare the two most related works, i.e., [Iglesias 2023] that is mentioned in the introduction and the above [Greer 2023] that is missing in the paper, and some traditional methods, like SyN in ANTs and Symmetric LDDMM. Also, can you show more qualitative results to demonstrate the improvement of the proposed method and analyze the contribution of each design accordingly? \n\n4. All the strategies used in this paper are what were used before, so, what are the challenges of this work? Is it necessary to have such a complicated network in practice?"
