But I saw a paper [a] about adaptive methods for stochastic bilevel optimization problem. The statement is not true.\n\n2. Although the algorithm utilized the adaptive method without knowing the Lipschitz constants, it did not achieve the state-of-the-art convergence rate. The state-of-the-art convergence rate for convex-strongly-convex case is $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/T^2)$ in [b]. Is it possible to improve the proposed algorithm to that rate?\n\n3. All the numerical results are plotted in terms of iterations. It would be better if the authors provide some results in terms of running time.\n\nReferences:\n\n[a].
