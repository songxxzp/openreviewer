The authors only conduct experiments with 3 qubits and a very small kernel, which seems no big difference from the toy dataset. The authors constantly mention that the main advancement of this paper is that they use real-world datasets, but results at this level are clearly not enough (with much larger scaling on MNIST [2]). \n4.

However, theoretical analysis and experiments in the paper do not provide enough evidence to support the fact that the proposed method mitigates the effects of noise. The theoretical analysis only considers perfect implementation and the experiments are conducted on an ideal circuit simulator. The suggested robustness of the method might be severely limited in the subroutines requiring precise control of the quantum system, e.g., the Hadamard test. The evidence in the paper does not convince me of the necessity of substituting VQLS for HHL in the QSVM in the first place.\n\nThe use of SVD to regularize the data seems not scalable. One of the benefits of QSVM is the ability to deal with high-dimensional data, while the classical SVD regularization can only be performed in small cases. This fact limits the scenarios where SVD might be useful. \n\nThe comparison with other quantum machine learning methods is also minimally discussed. The VQLS-enhanced QSVM is compared with only QSVM and SVM in only one example, where the performance of the VQLS-enhanced version seems much poorer than the other methods when the condition number is small.\n\nThe SVD regularization is also applicable to QSVM and SVM, while in the experiments it seems that SVD is not applied to the other methods. I believe these are essential to have a fair comparison of the methods.\n\nThe lack of consideration of noises also weakens the claims on the effectiveness of SVD.

For ease of implementation, the authors used SVD to get a simple Pauli decomposition of $A$. Using classical SVD to pre-process the data is not scalable, as the cost grows superlinearly with the size of the matrix $A$ (the quantum speedup comes from the assumption that we can represent the matrix $A$ using poly-log quantum resources). In other words, without an efficient data-loading procedure, I do not think the method proposed in this paper would achieve a significant end-to-end quantum advantage on a real NISQ device."
