                "value": "This paper proposes new classes of spanning trees named central spanning tree (CST) and branched central spanning tree (BCST) problems. CSTs can be considered as a continuous interpolation (with parameter $\\alpha$) of well-known minimum spanning trees (mST) ($\\alpha=0$) and the traditional minimum routing cost trees (MRCT) ($\\alpha=1$) where the sum of distances of all vertex pairs are minimized. BCST is the same as CST except that an additional branching point called Steiner point (SP) can be introduced, and it can be considered as a generalization of Steiner tree problem. This paper empirically reveals the robustness of CSTs against noise in graph data and theoretically investigates the possible topologies for BCSTs. Also, this paper proposes a heuristic algorithm for CST and BCST problem and empirically validated the optimality."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The introduced problems, CST and BCST problems, are currently less meaningful in both theoretical or practical senses than the existing problems. To introduce a new problem, it is desired that at least one of the following points are realized:\n\n(I) The newly introduced problem has a strength or offers a trade-off compared to the existing problems.\n(II) The newly introduced problem introduces a new better solution/insight on the existing problems.\n\nRegarding (I), it is empirically confirmed that the CST is robust against data perturbations, but the MRCT is also robust against data noise. So, I expected that the CST problem can be solved more easily than the MRCT problem. However, judging from the content, this is not the case: the CST is NP-hard for $\\alpha>0$ (Appendix C), and the performance of the proposed heuristics (mSTreg) has no clear correspondence to the $\\alpha$ value (Appendix N), meaning that the MRCT problem can be solved to the same extent as the CST/BCST problem. Therefore, I have found no significant advantage of the proposed CST/BCST problems over MRCT problem.\n\nRegarding (II), the heuristics for solving CST/MRCT problems is proposed (mSTreg) and it is applied to the existing problems, Steiner tree problem and MRCT problem. However, for Steiner tree problem, only instances such that the optimal solution is known are used as benchmarks. For MRCT problem, the proposed mSTreg falls short of the existing algorithm GRASP_PR. Although the authors claim that GRASP_PR is time-consuming because of heavy local search and it can be improved by using mSTreg for preprocessing, it is not verified through experiments. Therefore, currently the proposed heuristics, mSTreg, beats the existing methods only for the newly proposed CST/BCST problems.\n\nMinor comment:\nRegarding the final point, the computational time is also a key factor for the performance analysis of heuristic algorithms. I have read the per-iteration complexity and the time-measuring experiment in Appendix K, but I think at least a statement for computational time should be described on the main part of the problem. To the extent I understand, the per-iteration complexity is fairly small for graphs with 100 vertices and thus the proposed method runs much faster for the graphs used in the evaluation (Section 4.3). If the consumed time for the evaluation in Section 4.3 can be obtained and can be compared with the existing methods, they should be clearly stated."

The main paper refers extensively to the appendices, which are 30 pages long. Some parts of the main paper are difficult to read without calling up the long version, particularly the optimization algorithm (section 4). Mention should also be made of the link with the minimum concave cost network flow problem, which helps to show that the problem is NP-hard: some elements are given in the main body, but the link can only be understood by carefully reading the appendix.\n\nThe main advantage of the proposed model is its robustness to noise. However, it is only compared with the minimum spanning tree (and the Steiner tree in the case where nodes can be added), which is known not to be robust to noise. However, competing algorithms are mentioned: some are even used as benchmarks to measure the accuracy of the heuristic. The paper's main motivation (robustness) should be more thoroughly documented.\n\nOn the same aspect, it would be relevant for the authors to cite and compare with the following papers:\n> Kasperski and Zielinski (TCS, 2010). On the approximability of robust spanning tree problems.\n\n> Bezrukov et al. (LNCS, 1996). On central spanning trees of a graph.\n\nThe parameter $\\alpha$ serves as a trade-off between noise robustness and data fidelity, but how do the authors choose it? For example, why was $\\alpha=0.8$ chosen for the simulations in Figure 2? The model may lose some of its interest if practitioners do not know how to select $\\alpha$ in their applications."

Is this really the case? If it is, I have two questions:\n\n(i) First, is optimization problem (2) well formulated (compared to equation (1))?\n\n(ii) Then, is this model really relevant to extract the tree structure of a point cloud?\n\nI think this point should be better discussed throughout the paper.\n\nWhy do the authors exclude $\\alpha>1$ from their investigations? Did they study the complexity of the optimization problem (which is proved to be NP-hard only for $0<\\alpha\\leq 1$) in this case?\n\nWhy do the authors do not consider the central spanning tree (but only the branched version) in the application to 3D plant skeletonization?\n\npage 2: Is it obvious that the model turns into the minimum routing cost tree for $\\alpha=1$?\n\npage 6: Why does the optimization problem (2) is not everywhere differentiable?\n\nI can understand the theoretical interest behind the study of branching angles and degree of Steiner points, but what is the link with the rest of the paper?
