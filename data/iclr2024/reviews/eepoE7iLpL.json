In particular, it seems that some of the notations are overloaded (i.e., the same notation is used with different interpretations) or not clearly defined. For example, the notation $S$ appears as a *subset* of the ground set $V$ in the Introduction, but in Section 3.1 (Background), the notation $S$ appears as an *element* of $V$ that takes a matrix form. The relationship between elements $x_i \\in \\mathcal{X}$ and $S_i$ is not clearly defined either. On another note, it is not entirely clear to me what the function value $Y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$ is really referring to, which also appears without an explicit discussion of its meaning in the Introduction as part of the variational distribution $q(Y|S,V)$. Is $Y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$ supposed to be the utility function value (which was also introduced with the notation $U = F_{\\theta}(S,V)$ in the Introduction)? The confusion arising from notational ambiguity makes the paper less readable."

The footnote mentions that $Y_i$ is the \"probability of element $i$ being selected\", but this description is ambiguous.\n- It looks like learning the neural network approximation in Eq. (4) is done via variational inference as in Ou et al. (2022). As I am not familiar with the cited work, it is unclear to me how $q(Y|S,V)$ is serves as an approximation for the subset likelihood $p(S|V)$ when the former is a distribution over $Y$ and the latter is a distribution over $S$. Can the authors provide clarifications on this?\n- How is the neural network construction in Eq. (4) explicitly related to $p_{\\theta}(S,V)$ (or $F_{\\theta}(S,V)$)?"
