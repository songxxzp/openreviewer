Theoretically, the authors also show that\n\n- The representation of the `[mask]` has high rank at the last layer.

                "value": "My main concerns are about the theoretical arguments in this paper.\n\n## Main concern 1: The connection between pretraining and fine-tuning\n\nIn the introduction, the paper claims that \n>  Those dimensions exclusively used for [MASK] tokens have not been pretrained to represent real tokens, and will have to be either trained from scratch on downstream data, raising the risk of overfitting (Hendrycks et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2022), or become unused, resulting in a waste of model capacity.\n\nI think the interplay between pretraining and fine-tuning is very complicated and not fully understood yet. Thus I don\u2019t think this argument is substantiated. The authors cite Hendrycks et al. (2019) and Kumar et al. (2022) but I am not sure how these two works support this argument. Also, Figure (a) in this paper shows that inputs without a mask token have higher-rank representations. Doesn\u2019t it just indicate that the impact of having mask tokens during pretraining does not impact the rank of real tokens when mask tokens are not used?\n\n## Main concern 2: The unwritten assumptions of Theorem 2.2 \n\n***It seems that Theorem 2.2 is based on some unwritten assumptions***, e.g. the model needs to be an attention-only model without MLP and residual layers.\n\n## Main concern 3: The mismatch between the setup for Lemma 2.1 and the setup for Theorem 2.2\n\nFollowing the previous concern, Theorem 2.2 seems to be  based on some unwritten unrealistic assumptions, while Lemma 2.1 is based on the empirical results that (full) transformers can fit real-world high-rank distributions. If we look at the paper by Dong et al. (2021), we can find that under the assumption Theorem 2.2 is based on, the rank of the representation converges to 1. This implies that, under this assumption, Lemma 2.1 does not hold. Therefore, I think it\u2019s inappropriate to use Theorem 2.2 along with Lemma 2.1 to derive the conclusion of this paper.\n\n\n## Main concern 4: The weak implication of the theoretical results\n\nThe results only suggest that the representation of real tokens cannot be full-rank. It does not characterize how far the representation is from being full-rank. It is possible that the representation of the real tokens has rank $d - 1$. In this case, the so-called \u201crepresentation deficiency\u201d problem may not be a big issue.\n\n\n## Minor concern 1: The representation matrix of each example v.s. the whole corpus\n\nThe rank of the representation matrices discussed in Lemma 2.1 seems to be the representation matrix of the whole corpus. But in reality, we only feed in the model with a much shorter sequence of tokens, e.g., 512 tokens. In this case, the rank of the distribution of the masked tokens is at most 512 * 15% (in expectation), meaning that the mask tokens can\u2019t occupy too many dimensions. \n\nThis may not be a big issue, but I think the arguments starting from Theorem 2.2 need to be rewritten a little bit. For example, in Theorem 2.2, because it\u2019s about the sequence fed into a transformer model, the representation matrix should be of an example rather than of the whole corpus. Therefore, Lemma 2.1 can\u2019t be used directly.\n\n\n## Minor concern 2: The contribution of this work\n\nThis work has some similarities with the work by Dong et al. (2021):\n\n1. Dong et al. (2021) also plot the representation rank of transformer models.\n2. Theorem 2.2 in this paper is largely based on the proof from Dong et al. (2021).\n\nI think the authors should give credit to Dong et al. more explicitly."

The proposed method, MAE-LM, addresses the identified mismatch issue without resorting to complex architectural alterations. This simplicity ensures the resulting pretrained model retains compatibility with existing BERT-like models, demonstrating the method's applicability.\n\n3. The paper's evaluation is very solid, adhering to standard practices with comprehensive benchmarking on GLUE and SQuAD, compared against multiple strong baselines. MAE-LM consistently outperforms these baselines across multiple scales\u2014base, base++, and large++\u2014sometimes even by substantial margins.\n\n4.
