                "value": "The paper introduces a novel approach called GASSIP (Lightweight Graph Neural Architecture Search with Graph Sparsification and Network Pruning) for automating the design of efficient Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It highlights the needs for lightweight GNAS and data sparsification to reduce resource requirements. GASSIP employs operation pruning and curriculum graph data sparsification to iteratively optimize GNN architectures and graph data, resulting in more efficient and accurate lightweight GNNs. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over traditional GNNs and GNAS, achieving substantial performance improvements with significantly reduced search time."

There have been a series of work for the co-optimization of neural architecture and data, even at the domain of graph NAS and graph data. \n2.\tI am still concerned about the motivation to work on graph NAS. Different to other neural architectures, there are only several layers in GNNs, and the number of candidate operations is limited. I believe if one only applies the popular toolkit of hyperparameter tuning, the much higher performance will be obtained. \n3.\tThe unstructured pruning of model weights makes no sense in the practical efficiency improvement. Based on the current parallel hardware (with processing of single instruction multiple data), the unstructured matrix multiplication has almost the same cost with the dense matrix multiplication."

For example, one can remove edges based on degrees of 1/d_i + 1/d_j, where d_i and d_j are the degrees of node i and j, respectively. It is easy to remove more than 90% of edges but maintain the comparable performance [1].\n[1] Lov\u00e1sz, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. \"Random walks on graphs.\" Combinatorics, Paul erdos is eighty 2.1-46 (1993): 4\n5.

Could you please give a more overall perfomance comparison with other GNAS methods like GUASS  on large-scale OGB datasets? \n\n   [1] Large-scale graph neural architecture search, ICML 2022.\n\n2. More comparsion on the unified benchmark will be appreciated, such as NAS-Bench-Graph.\n\n   [2] Benchmarking Graph Neural Architecture Search, NIPS 2022.\n\n3. Cited works in Section 2 are mostly before 2022 and the methods compared in Table 1 are all before 2021 which make the work out-dated. I do know there were multiple GNAS and graph sparsification methods proposed in 2022/2023. Maybe more cutting-edge research work as well as comparisions should be added. \n\n4. The first contribution is proprosing a operation-pruned search method with learnable weight mask. However, the work of HM-NAS introduced this hierarchical masking on redundant operations, edges, and even the weights of supernet. It seems like transfering the idea on graphs. Maybe you should add this work and discuss the noble part of the first contribution compared with the learnable weight mask idea on edges in HM-NAS.  \n\n   [3] HM-NAS: Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Hierarchical Masking, ICCV 2019.\n\n6. I feel a little confused about the workflow in Figure 1. I understand that the iterative training process of structure mask is between the gradient update of operations and architectures. However, the training process probably need to point back to the architecture searching part to illustrate the interactive training not directly getting the final sparsed graph and connecting to the pruned architecture. Maybe the training part and the procedures after binarizing masks can be seperated."
