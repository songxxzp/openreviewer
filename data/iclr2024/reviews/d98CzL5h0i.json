                "value": "This paper proposes D^2LOLS, an RL optimization technique that can take advantage of the use of a guide policy to overcome some of the limitations of RL algorithms currently used with LLMs, such as PPO. The basic intuition is to use guidance from a superior model to ensure that the target model does better than the guidance model, by biasing rollouts to more optimal paths that the superior model might have taken and updating the target model with the reward within this superior set of rollouts. Related work is reviewed, and the proposed method is described clearly in steps as updates and combinations of previous work. Theoretical justification is given for why D^2LOLS should do better, due to restarting on states according to the guidance model, though an assumption is made that does not seem to be clearly evidenced, see Questions.\n\nExperiments are performed on 3 datasets: IMDB, CommonGen, and TL;DR. The first two are rather simple (write a movie review with a given sentiment, include words in a given generated sentence), and IMDB is further handicapped to only consider one sentiment. Furthermore, the gains over baselines are relatively small. Additionally, the authors do a study of the tradeoff between optimizing for the RL reward and perplexity, which can be interpreted as a partial proxy for the acceptable space of generated outputs. In a similar vein, hyperparameter sensitivity is discussed with further experiments.\n\nThe authors conclude by suggesting that the proposed technique allows for superior optimization using only black box access to a guidance policy, making it especially useful in the era of powerful LLMs which can only be accessed through APIs."

It\u2019s pretty clear that our metrics only work under \u201cnormal conditions\u201d where complete gibberish isn\u2019t being measured, so using the KL divergence as the other axis shows a potential pareto frontier that we\u2019re working with in these problems.\n\n- The fact that the proposed technique seems to generalize slightly better than previous techniques to harder examples (with less train-test overlap) on CommonGen is interesting, and does validate the technique to some extent, though the margin is relatively small."

                "value": "- The benchmarks used are somewhat lacking. For text generation in 2023, most comparisons for state of the art methods are made by comparisons to other LLMs because fixed metrics have been found to be lacking. A comparison using a framework like Chatbot Arena (Zheng et al. 2023). would have made the results significantly more convincing. These often use GPT-4 as an evaluator, which has now been shown to be provisionally better than traditional metrics (Liu et al 2023, Min et al 2023, Zhou et al 2023, inter alia).\n\n- Even with these quite simple benchmarks, the resulting differences on metrics are small for the task where control is more significant, CommonGen. In IMDB the task-specific metric really only checks if the sentiment score is correct, which is very little information to be using to validate outputs.\n\n- The fact that perplexity goes up but output perplexity goes down on IMDB is worrying. I can understand why perplexity would go up: the model is likely collapsing onto a smaller subspace of possibilities, which may still be higher quality. However, the fact that the output perplexity also goes down is worrying: it indicates that after optimization the resultant model is more predictable to LMs which is usually not a good sign for tasks that LMs are bad at in the first place. The results on TL;DR are similarly quite small.\n\n- I\u2019m disappointed to see there\u2019s no study of how this technique scales across model sizes: one could imagine doing this for smaller models, incurring relatively low compute expenses, but no such experiments were conducted. As it is, it is not clear how much these results will generalize to the ever-growing zoo of LLMs.\n\nWorks Referenced\n\nLiu, Yang, Dan Iter, Yichong Xu, Shuohang Wang, Ruochen Xu, and Chenguang Zhu. 2023. \u201cG-Eval: NLG Evaluation Using GPT-4 with Better Human Alignment.\u201d arXiv [cs.CL]. arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634.\n\nMin, Sewon, Kalpesh Krishna, Xinxi Lyu, Mike Lewis, Wen-Tau Yih, Pang Wei Koh, Mohit Iyyer, Luke Zettlemoyer, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi. 2023. \u201cFActScore: Fine-Grained Atomic Evaluation of Factual Precision in Long Form Text Generation.\u201d arXiv [cs.CL]. arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14251.\n\nZheng, Lianmin, Ying Sheng, Wei-Lin Chiang, Hao Zhang, Joseph E.

While authors compare against SFT and basic PPO, prior research developed alternative algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs on human feedback that also claim superiority to PPO and SFT. Authors even cite some of those works in the paper. Some of those algorithms are: DPO[1], APA[2], P3O[3], SLiC-HF[4] though there may be more.\n\n* [1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290\n* [2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02231\n* [3] https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00212 - note: this was published after the paper submission and authors should feel free to ignore it\n* [4] https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10425v1\n\nThese works adopt different means to learn from human feedback: some of them compatible to RLGF while others can only be used as competitors. I believe that the paper would be improved if, for each competitor, authors either compare against it in the experiments or prove that it has no chance of outperforming RLGF algorithms or, if authors claim that RLGF algorithms are orthogonal, demonstrate how it performs in combination with those approaches.\n\nAnother, less important concern is about the paper structure. Authors manage to cram multiple algorithms (PPO++, AggreVaTeD, LOLS in Appendix B, D2LOLS) and evaluate all of them within the few allowed pages. As a result, the paper fills \"crammed\" despite authors' considerable effort.\nPerhaps it would be better to explore one or two of those algorithms **in more detail** and leave the rest to appendix? Though, I will understand if authors deliberately choose otherwise.\n\nFor the last (and least) of issues, the idea of guiding the search for optimal policy is technically not novel outside the LLM fine-tuning domain, and the same can be said about other ideas presented in the paper. To reiterate, it is not a \"problem\" to be solved, and a good practical adaptation of existing methods is valuable in and of itself."
