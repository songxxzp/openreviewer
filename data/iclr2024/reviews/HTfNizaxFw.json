However, although the metric value at each \u03bb is written in the discussion, it was difficult for me to find any quantitative evaluation of the tendency.\nAlthough it is understandable that it is difficult to evaluate using a simple single performance index to express the content that this paper wants to claim, this paper should consider evaluation indicators based on the content of the claims for each experimental result. there were. Therefore, unfortunately, I could not agree that the results of this experiment showed what the author wanted to claim."

An objective is formulated that (1) encourages the reciever to recover various aspects of the original input, (2) encourages the reciever to recover some task-specific aspect of the original input in the smallest possible subset of the K symbols, and (3) maximizes compression of the message using a variational bound. The paper also proposes a new measure of compositionality, pdmi. This measure is used for evaluation along a measure from prior work, topsim. The authors find that the 3 aspects of their proposed objective increase the compositionality of the transmitted messages according to these measures across several toy environments."

                "value": "* My main concern with this paper is the framing of the research questions. It was not clear to me whether the key research questions are well motivated. The primary research question of whether the proposed objective can encourage the encoded messages to be more compositional according to the proposed measure seems a bit circular. It seems somewhat trivial that one can increase various measures of \"compositionality\" of encoded messages by introducing a regularization objective that closely relates to that desired measure. The information theoretic aspects of the proposed objective seem closely related to aspects of the proposed measure, pdmi. Taken to the extreme, why not regularize directly for pdmi? Other prior work has considered how well communicating agents can generalize to new inputs, and related this to measures of compositionality (e.g. Chaabouni et al. 2020), rather than adopting such measures as the end goal. Does the proposed objective also lead to better generalization? How does pdmi relate to various types of generalization? Alternatively, one could use measures of compositionality to compare and contrast emergent communication between agents to human communication, but the connection between the proposed metric and human-like communication is not well established, and the experiments don't directly offer insights into actual human communication.\n* The concept of applying VQ-VIB to emergent communication comes from prior work \"Trading off Utility, Informativeness, and Complexity in Emergent Communication\" (Tucker et al. 2022). This is (thankfully) made clear in the paper, but does reduce the scope of the contribution.\n* Nit: it's not clear to what extent the phenomena described in the paper is \"emergent\" communication. There is strong supervision for the messages being transmitted."
