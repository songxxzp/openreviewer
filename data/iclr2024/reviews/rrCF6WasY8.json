Essentially you can turn local DP into a central DP via secure aggregation. In particular, [1] (which is already included in the submission) gives an implementation of distributed DP mechanism that has matching utility with central DP. In Table 1, you claim that DP-FL has noise scale of $O(1/m\\sqrt{n})$, which could be too large.\n\nIf I understand correctly, 1 round of secure aggregation is enough because the average of local SVM models converges to global SVM optimal. This seems to limit the use case, because in practice we do not often use SVM in FL. Indeed we observe good performance in experiments, but it may also come from the use of pretrained feature extractor. More justification of the importance of SVM learning is highly appreciated.\n\n[1] Kairouz, Peter, Ziyu Liu, and Thomas Steinke. \"The distributed discrete gaussian mechanism for federated learning with secure aggregation.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
