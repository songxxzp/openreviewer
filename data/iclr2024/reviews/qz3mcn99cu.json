                "value": "It finds that an apparent limitation preventing prior work from discovering the full potential of Lipschitz-based certification stems from the framing and evaluation setup. Specifically, most prior work is framed around a particular novel technique intended to supersede the state-of-the-art, necessitating evaluations centered on standardized benchmark hyperparameter design spaces, rather than exploring more\ngeneral methods for improving performance (e.g., architecture choice, data pipeline, etc.).\n\n\nIt discovers that the addition of large \u201cCholesky-orthogonalized residual dense\u201d layers to the end of existing state-of-the-art Lipschitz-controlled ResNet architectures is especially effective for increasing network capacity and performance. \n\nThis work provides a more comprehensive evaluation to illuminate the potential of Lipschitz-based certification methods. It finds that by delving more thoroughly into the design space of Lipschitz-based approaches, it can improve the state-of-the-art VRA for deterministic certification significantly on a variety of benchmark datasets, and over a range of perturbation sizes. Combined with filtered generative data augmentation, the final results further the state of the art deterministic VRA by up to 8.5 percentage points.\n\nIt provides an overview of the existing methods used for controlling the Lipschitz constant during training, and propose its own method that can be combined with other approaches.\n\nIt discusses the role data augmentation plays in training high-capacity models. It covers DDPM, which prior work has found helpful for certified training, and proposes an alteration to the typical augmentation strategy that further boosts performance."
