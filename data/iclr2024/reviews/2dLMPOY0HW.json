The author propose a crude estimate on the extent to which node features cover graph structure information. Based on the idea of maximizing the mutual information between node embeddings and the graph structure, the authors introduce a novel regularization-based MLP model termed InfoMLP. InfoMLP consists of a preprocessing step and a learning step. Only the preprocessing step requires utilizing the graph structure information. Once the raw node features are preprocessed, InfoMLP has the same efficiency as a standard MLP during both the training and testing phases. Empirically, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance over a few small benchmark datasets, while being much more efficient than existing graph neural networks."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- A number of claims in Section 3.1 are not well justified by either theoretical or empirical evidence. Here are some examples:\n  - At the end of page 3, the authors claim that \"We hypothesize that this is due to the high degree of overlap between the information conveyed by node features X and the graph structure A\", and then proceed with an \"analysis\" using the cartoons in Figure 1. First of all, I do not think that the hypothesis is correct in general. As a very simple example, consider a balanced stochastic block model with 2 equal-sized classes, inter-class edge probability q=0 and intra-class edge probability p=1. That is, consider a graph that consists of two complete subgraphs, with one subgraph corresponds to class 0 and the other subgraph corresponds to class 1. Furthermore, assign node IDs 1,2,...,N to the nodes uniformly at random, and let the node features be the one-hot encodings of node IDs. This makes I(X;A) = 0 since X and A are independent. However, it should be clear to see that, even in this case, a strong Laplacian regularization would make an MLP to perform nearly as good as, e.g., GCN. In my example above I am omitting details regarding the representation (which concerns with the ability to approximate/represent certain functions)  and generalization (which concerns with sample complexity) capabilities of MLP and GCN. I welcome the authors' feedback on this example. In any case, I would recommend the authors be careful about stating a hypothesis, in particular, when certain assumptions are required for a claim to be true.\n  - I found that the authors were very vague in their discussion about comparing MLPs with GNNs. For example, in the second paragraph on page 4, when discussing Figure 1(b), the authors claim that \"Thus, MLPs are expected to have the same capacity as GNNs in this context\". The term capacity is a very vague term, here, do the authors refer to representational power, or do the authors refer to generalization capability? Note that when an MLP has a worse test accuracy than a GNN, it could be due to either expressiveness or generalization or both. Overall, I really could not appreciate the discussion in Section 3.1. I am not convinced by the authors' conclusion that the performance gap between MLP and GNN is determined by the mutual information. I would recommend the authors constrain the problem context by explicitly stating the required assumptions and focus on specific data generative models. Otherwise, the current claims feel very unsupported.\n  - As another example, at the top of page 4, the authors claim that \"..., a well-trained MLP model might implicitly derive an estimated graph structure matrix from the outset. It could then implicitly leverage both the estimated graph structure and the raw node features to generate node embeddings, thereby achieving performance similar to that of GNNs.\" This claim is neither theoretically justified nor empirically verified in this paper. Even in the extreme case where one considers augmented feature matrix X' = [X; A], so that the graph structure is completely covered by X', it is unclear if an MLP acting on X' can achieve similar performance to that of GNNs.\n  - To be honest, I think the paper might be better if the authors simply delete Section 3.1. Alternatively, the authors should be very careful in the writing. Clearly state all necessary assumptions on the data/model/architecture, clearly define and use proper technical terms, and avoid using vague terms. Otherwise, I find it very hard to be convinced by the messages which the authors try to convey in Section 3.1.\n\n- There is a clear gap between $H(A|X)$ and $H(A|\\hat{A})$ in equation 1, and the paper does not provide a bound on $|H(A|X)-H(A|\\hat{A})|$. Therefore, it is difficult to determine how useful the proposed metric $H(A|\\hat{A})$ is. The authors should at least discuss the reason to choose the $\\ell_2$ distance for $\\hat{A} = f(X)$.\n\n- Although the empirical results over small datasets in Section 4 look promising, the additional results over larger datasets in the appendix are not very good. Since one of the major advantages of MLPs over GNNs is efficiency, the performance of InfoMLP over larger datasets is more relevant and important. I think the authors should provide results on larger datasets in the main text, and place the results over small datasets in the appendix. However, over larger datasets, InfoMLP is outperformed by simple GNN architectures such as GCN or even SGC which does not suffer from efficiency issues."

Based on the proof I think it should be $H(A|X) \\le \\inf_f H(A|\\hat{A})$?\n\n- For training and testing time of SGC reported in Table 5: I think that once preprocessing is done, SGC is basically a liner logistic regression. Why does it have slower training and testing time than InfoMLP?\n\n- At the end of page 6, the authors claim that \"Furthermore, the node embeddings $Z_{aug}$ are utilized to predict the node labels.\" Based on the description of the method, shouldn't $Z_{mlp}$ be utilized to predict the node labels? In any case, I think the authors should report the performance achieved by both $Z_{aug}$ and $Z_{mlp}$ for comparison purposes."
