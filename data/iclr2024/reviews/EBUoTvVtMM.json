The adversary has access to a subset of a user's data and uses a simple attack that applies a threshold on the average loss of a user\u2019s documents.  The authors also design canaries to study the influence of shared substrings. The authors also explore factors that affect the attack's success rate as well as mitigation strategies."

This is a reasonable assumption for sample-level inference attacks, but it may not be the right assumption for user inference attacks. Consider emails, the content in email $x_{i+1}$ probably depends on the previous email $x_{i}$.\n\n3.There are two intuitive mitigations that may be worth exploring. The first is to clip user-level gradients instead of sample-level gradients, this helps control user contribution even if one user has many more documents than others. The second is to deduplicate documents from a single user (motivated by the finding in Figure 6)."

When merging samples from diverse tasks or domains during finetuning (_e.g._, blogs of different topics or on different media platforms), samples from the same domains might exhibit greater similarity than those from the same user. Also, since the pre-trained model is used as the reference model to calculate the test statistic, it\u2019s also necessary to control and analyze the similarity among the pre-training data, the fine-tuning data, and the attacker\u2019s knowledge, considering these potentially influential factors. \n\nIn this case, the disparity in attack performance on the three datasets may not solely be attributed to the amount of each user's data. For example, content in ArXiv Abstracts is usually more objective and its characteristics might be more reflective of the specific topics/subjects rather than the individual user identities/styles.

Framing existing attack terminology (\u201cuser inference\u201d) as something new is confusing as there are already multiple works proposing the stronger threat model where either X texts of a user\u2019s data or none were used to train the model (e.g., Song and Shmatikov). To the best of my understanding, it seems that user-level + fine-tuning + LLM is new, but the current wording doesn't reflect that, instead suggesting that the paper introduces user-level MIAs. \n- 2) The arXiv abstracts dataset seems unsuitable for user-level MIAs. Indeed, the authors assign the user who submitted the paper as the \u201cuser\u201d (i.e., the author). However, papers have multiple authors which may rewrite or edit the abstract, e.g., the PI. Hence, an abstract could be assigned as belonging to an individual even though it was largely written by someone else. I see two issues with this: (a) Potential authorship overlap between different users' documents, e.g., the same author (PI)\u2019s data could be labeled as belonging to multiple users and (b) The task being evaluated looks like PI/research group inference attack. The \u201cuser\u201d terminology is thus misleading, and this should be acknowledged early on.\n- 3) Problematic evaluation due to non-member users\u2019s data having already been used to pre-train the LLM. The LLMs used in this work are pre-trained in 2021 on The Pile, whose description suggests that it contains both arXiv papers and the Enron Emails dataset. The results are thus biased because the LLM already saw both members and non-members\u2019 data in the pre-training stage. To address this, the authors could evaluate their attack on a dataset known not to have been part of training. This can be done by using arXiv abstracts from 2022 onwards (although these suffer from the problem highlighted above) or another dataset from the well-studied authorship attribution problem, see e.g., Luyckx et al. https://aclanthology.org/C08-1065.pdf)"

One appeal of the relaxed user inference threat model is that it allows to study questions such as: what in a user\u2019s writings (topic, style, both) is constant enough across different texts to enable the attack to succeed. These questions are widely studied in the AA literature and there are many publicly available controlled datasets, see e.g. Luyckx et al.
