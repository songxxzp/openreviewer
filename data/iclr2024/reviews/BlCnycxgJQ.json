The main problem that this paper tackles is that optimization algorithms only guarantee a presence of structure like sparsity at the convergence point but don\u2019t offer any guarantee of the structure at points close to the stationary points which is what we use in practice. Utilizing the theory of manifold identification, RAMDA ensures that after a finite number of steps, the structures of the iterates are identical to the structure at the stationary point of convergence and their algorithm is adaptive. To achieve this, the authors tackle the challenges of solving subproblems in the presence of preconditioners and regularization terms by proposing an iterative subroutine that approximately solves these issues, while still maintaining convergence guarantees. The paper includes experiments with modern neural networks in computer vision, language processing, and speech tasks, demonstrating that RAMDA achieves better structured sparsity and prediction performance than the state of the art."

This problem of guaranteeing structure near the stationary point has already been studied. Like the challenges in variance reduction with data augmentation have been already dealt with in the RMDA paper. The main contribution in this work is of making the RMDA algorithm adaptive. Moreover, there are other works as the authors mention like Defazio and Jelassi which had already combined adaptiveness and momentum.
