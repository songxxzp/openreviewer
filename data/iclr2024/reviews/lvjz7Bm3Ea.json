The proposed method consists of an autoencoder type with a convolutional layer that can capture the basic features of time series and a Gaussian mixture model that can capture multiple cluster structures in the latent space.\nThe authors have embedded some innovations in the proposed method to solve some problems that related methods have had in practical use. Specifically,\n- The proposed method is a data-driven method using data energy instead of manual thresholding, which is often required in one-class learning.\n- Instead of the ${\\rm exp}$ function, which causes instability in the calculation of data energy, the proposed method improves the stability of the calculation by proposing an ${\\rm explu}$ function.\n\nFurthermore, the paper demonstrates the practical usefulness of the proposed method with objective measures for a remarkably large number of experimental data."

The authors' perspectives on the latest developments and current issues are well organized, especially in the context of one-class learning.\n- The objective evaluation experiments that demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed method are notably large, comprehensive, and fair. It is suggested that the models assumed by the proposed method (time series representation by convolutional auto encoder and cluster structure in latent space by Gaussian mixture model) fit well on many real data."

                "value": "My concern is that the discussion of the validity of the improvements from the Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM) [Zong+2018], which is the inspiration for this study, may be somewhat lacking. The model used in this paper can be viewed as a legitimate successor to DAGMM from an overarching and conceptual perspective. Therefore, I was reading the manuscript with the expectation that the manuscript would carefully explain the validity of each improvement from it. Certainly, I agree that empirically and experimentally those improvements work well, as the authors have shown us in their evaluation experiments, but I am left with some points that are not clear to me why they work well from the perspective of scientific and technological development. My concerns can be summarized as follows.\n- This paper introduces a convolutional approach to time series modeling with reference (maybe, as a standard method described in [Wang+2017]) to existing research on time series classification problems. It seems to me that the strengths of this approach (i.e., for what time series can well-fitted features be captured) and the weaknesses (what time series are difficult to represent) have not been adequately discussed.\n- I am having difficulty understanding the validity of the explu function, one of the devices of the proposed method. explu function can be seen as an approximation/substitution for computational stability of what is originally an exp function, but I have not been able to find an explanation of what the sacrifice is.\n\nThese two concerns could be misunderstandings due to my lack of understanding. If there is any misunderstanding on my part, I would be very grateful if the authors could clear it up in their response."

                "value": "I would like to ask the following questions to see if my understanding of the two concerns I raised in the weaknesses section above is incorrect.\n\n(1) Regarding the convolution approach that this paper employs to represent time series.\n- Is the adoption of the convolution approach the recommended setting by the authors? Or is it adopted because it is known as the most basic and standard in the field concerned? For example, if the user has prior knowledge of the time series of interest, is it easy to change the proposed method to a time series model specific to that interest (in this context, the design of the AE layer)?\n- Is this a robust setting for local (near temporal) features of the time series of interest, as the standard convolution assumes? Or is it also possible to capture very distant temporal dependencies (in the extreme case, where the first frame determines the last frame) or periodic structures?\n\n(2) Regarding ${\\rm explu}$ function.\nI believe that instability in the computation of covariance (the inverse of covariance) is a challenge often faced in statistical machine learning. For example, this problem often arises in Gaussian process regression (GPR) when the observed data are of high dimension. In GPR, this problem is usually addressed indirectly (the direct motivation is to reduce the computational complexity of the inverse of the covariance matrix) using, for example, variational methods or induced points [Titsias+2009]. While these methods require rather complicated handling, I feel that the explu function in this paper is a very simple and impressive potential new way to deal with this problem. So let me ask a question.\n- What are the disadvantages that arise when replacing the exp function with the explu function?\n- Can that disadvantage be ignored in practical application situations?\n\nM.
