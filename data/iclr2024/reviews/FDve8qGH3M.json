Could the authors explain the reason behind this specific arrangement? Furthermore, it would be beneficial if the authors could provide an ablation study examining the impact of the positioning of these normalization layers within the network.\n3) The paper describes the use of both SiLU and GSiLU activation functions within the architecture, with the use of SiLU as the first activation layer. Could the authors provide insight into the reason underpinning this specific sequence?\n4) The claim that GSiLU enhances the performance of small 3x3 kernels by capturing global spatial information warrants empirical validation. Could the authors clarify if GSiLU doesn't have similar benefits to larger kernel sizes?\n5) The functionality of GSiLU, which zeros out channels with sufficiently negative averages, prompts a request for statistical analysis. Could the authors provide data on the proportion of channels that are effectively zeroed by the GSiLU activation in practice?\n6) As part of a review process, I believe it is expected to validate the findings through an independent examination of the code and model (Hence, my low confidence score.).
