                "value": "This paper presents a new credit assignment strategy for efficiently learning a reward function in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL). The preference-based reward model relies on the well-known Bradley-Terry model, and the basic loss consists of the standard cross-entropy loss between the predicted and the true preference labels. The novel contribution of this paper is an additional loss term that redistributes the expected discounted return to each state-action pair in a particular manner. Specifically, a transformer-based forward dynamics model is learned as an auxiliary task, and the expected discounted return is redistributed to be proportional to the attention weights of the state-action pairs. This additional loss term serves as the prior for reward learning, and the authors hypothesize that it leads to sample efficiency and overall policy performance. The empirical evaluation on Deep Mind Control (DMC) and MetaWorld control tasks suggest positive results."

                "value": "A major strength of the paper is that the proposed framework is general in the sense that it can be applied to different baseline PbRL algorithms to improve sample efficiency and performance.\nIn the beginning it was not intuitive to believe that the return should be redistributed according to attention weights of the forward dynamics, but the explanation provided in Appendix I is somewhat convincing that the attention weights are reflective of critical events that summarize the whole trajectory, and thus it is those critical state-action pairs that contribute the most to the success/failure of the trajectory."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The authors propose an intriguing approach to boost the performance of PbRL, but some of the empirical results presented in Section 5 reveal some weaknesses. In particular, in the Drawer Open / 4000 task in Figure 2, the success rate of the proposed approach plateaus after 400k steps and is eventually surpassed by some other baselines. This might imply that the hindsight prior eventually hurts the performance of the learned policy as more preference labels become available. Similarly, in Section 5.3 the authors find that a large coefficient on the prior loss leads to a collapse of the learned policy. Those observations indicate that such a prior is assistive of policy learning only up to a certain point (e.g. relatively small preference data or small prior coefficient), and it may eventually hurt the performance if we exceed those bars.\n\nIn terms of the presentation of the paper, there is much room for improvement. First, some citations and references are missing and appearing as \u201c?\u201d or \u201c??\u201d. Second, some performance plots in Section 5 have too many curves of similar colors and widths, making it difficult to extract information from them. Specifically, I suggest that the authors use different line styles for Figure 2 (in particular for SAC since it\u2019s an oracular baseline). The left two figures of Figure 3 are also hard to read as there are 8 line plots on each tiny figure. Third, the explanation of hindsight prior is confusing and needs elaboration/clarification. (a) The transformer uses H attention heads, but H does not appear in the definition of the attention matrix A. (b) Equation (4) uses the notation $R_{target}$ and $\\hat{R}$, but it is unclear how it is related to $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\psi}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{target}$ in the line above."

This approach assumes that states receiving high attention in the world model are likely to be rewarding, assigning them higher weight when estimating the reward function.
