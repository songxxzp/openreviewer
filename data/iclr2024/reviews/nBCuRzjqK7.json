Therefore, the representations of windows within a mini-batch that are more similar are explicitly induced to get closer compared to other samples with lower correlations. The proposed contrastive loss is then added to a decomposition-based forecasting model as a regularization term. Experiments show impressive performance improvements over existing SOTA models."
