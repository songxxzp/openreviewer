These pixels are processed by the sparse feature extractor (Minkowski UNet) while preserving the same sparsity pattern throughout the model. Sparse features are converted to predictions through projection onto the Cityscapes taxonomy. Finally, the joint predictions are recovered by ensembling the dense low-resolution predictions with sparse high-resolution predictions according to regressed weights."
