To just name a few:\n- Wang et al., ProlificDreamer. NeurIPS 2023.\n- Chen et al., Fantasia3d. ICCV 2023\n- Lorraine et al., ATT3D: Amortized Text-to-3D Object Synthesis. ICCV 2023\n\nArguably, these works all try to tackle the consistency problem (with the help of volume rendering). Please discuss the difference / benefits between this submission and these prior works.\n\n### 2. About Results and Contributions\n\nCan the authors further clarify the reason behind claiming TuneMV3D as a \"generalizable\" and \"scalable\" approach? \n\nThough to some extent, I understand that \"generalizable\" may come from the feed-forward manner. However, on the other hand, the results shown in the paper come from arguably simple objects, e.g., chairs. This quite falls behind other text-to-3D generation qualities in prior works, e.g., ProlificDreamer or ATT3D. Therefore, it is unclear whether this can be claimed as truly \"generalizable\".\n\nSimilarly, \"scalable\" may also need more justification even considering the training needs 3D datasets, which is less \"scalable\" to obtain. Prior works only use 2D diffusion models trained on 2D images. Frankly speaking, the whole \"interactive diffusion\" (Sec. 3.1) is possible because of the existence of 3D data. This somehow undermines the \"scalable\" statement.\n\nAs a natural question, can the authors show some generation results with some texts similar to those used in prior works to showcase the capability of the TuneMV3D? \n\n### 3. Ablation about NeuS Supervision\n\nIn Sec. 4.1, the authors state:\n\n> For each object, we rendered 16 views: eight were used as inputs during training, while the remaining were employed to supervise NeuS\u2019s novel view reconstruction, thereby mitigating NeuS degradation.\n\nCan authors provide an ablation about when no NeuS supervision is used? I am quite curious about the role such supervision plays during training. Essentially, I am wondering whether it is due to such supervision that results in consistency.\n\n### 4. Ablation about The Number of Views\n\nCan authors ablate over the number of views used during training? This is related to the bulletin 3 above as this will demonstrate how important the 3D dataset is.\n\n### 5. Appendix Format\n\nThe appendix uses NeurIPS's template instead of ICLR's."

This contracdicts the claim by the author that the method is creative because it\u2019s finetuned on only a small high-quality 3D dataset.\n2. For the examples shown in the image-to-3d section, it\u2019s unclear what the sources of these images are.\n3. There are no quantitative experiments in the paper/supplementary. The qualitative examples shown in the paper are also not uncurated or randomly selected so likely cherry-picked. These expeirmental studies don't provide enough evidence that the proposed method is superior to priors works in performance.\n4. For image to 3D, there\u2019s no comparison with prior methods on any real-world images. Showing some results on real-world images will be necessary in supporting the claim by the authors.\n5. Many of the important baselines before the submission of this work are missing in the experiments. For example, DreamFusion, Magic3D, ProlificDreamer, SnapFusion, all of which open-source implementation has been made available. Without both quantitative and qualitative comparisons to these works, it\u2019s hard to evaluate the contribution of the proposed method.\n6. One of the main proposed advantages of the method is that the model is able to produce \"creative\" 3D generation due to the fact that it's only finetuned on a small set of 3D data. However, such \"creativity\" is not demonstrated in either quanlitative or qualitative experiments. I suggest the authors either remove the claim or provide strong evidence that the proposed model demonstrates such \"creativity\"."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**Missing Related Work:**\n\n- The paper lacks mention of \"MVDiffusion: Enabling Holistic Multi-view Image Generation with Correspondence-Aware Diffusion\" by Tang et al., NeurIPS'23, which focuses on generating multi-view images from text prompts using diffusion models. MVDiffusion incorporates correspondence-aware attention blocks to learn multi-view consistency, which aligns with the pairwise geometric conditions discussed in the submitted paper.\n\n**Clarity of Presentation:**\n\n- The presentation of the paper is somewhat unclear. While it introduces multiple trainable modules, it lacks information about the training loss or the optimization program used. It's crucial to specify whether this framework is trained using SDS loss or follows a supervised learning approach, similar to \"zero-123.\" The statement in the introduction that mentions achieving results \"with only small-scale 3D training data\" implies supervised learning, but this should be explicitly clarified.\n\n  Furthermore, information (Sec. B.3) that is currently located in the supplementary materials should be incorporated into the main paper. These details, together with necessary loss arguments which are currently missing, are significant and should not be relegated to the supplementary materials. These comments reflect my concerns while reading the main paper, and it's important to ensure that critical information is presented within the main paper, as not all readers may refer to the supplementary materials.\n\n**Issues with Experiments and Evaluation:**\n\n- The experiments and evaluation have room for improvement in several ways:\n   1) Qualitative results suffer from very low resolution, falling far short of state-of-the-art optimization-based text-to-3D methods such as \"Prolificdreamer.\"\n   2) The results with \"zero-123\" appear unusual (Fig. 5), possibly due to the low resolution of the reference image. These results are not very convincing. \"Zero-123\" is typically capable of generating highly detailed images.\n   3) The ablation study does not strongly support the claims. Fig. 6 presents only one scene, and the values of K are sparse. The difference between K=0.33 and K=5 is not clearly demonstrated.\n   4) The paper lacks quantitative evaluation. While Section 4.4 addresses the image-to-3D task, quantitative benchmarks, such as those used in \"zero-123,\" could provide more rigorous assessment. Similarly, geometry quality evaluation, following the approach in \"shape-e,\" could be valuable.\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\n- It's not entirely clear why this paper chooses to train on a subset of Objaverse, limiting itself to objects within LVIS categories. This decision could potentially restrict the impact of the work.\n- There is a concurrent work titled \"MVDream: Multi-view Diffusion for 3D Generation\" by Shi et al. in 2023. While mentioning it might be relevant, it is not an obligation for the authors to do so.\n- Failure case and limitation are encouraged to be discussed."

                "value": "- **Clarification on Reference View**: In Fig.3, it would be helpful to specify which image serves as the reference view for clarity.\n\n- **Support for Enhanced Efficiency**: In Section 3.5, the paper mentions that TuneMV3D, when combined with optimization methods like Poole et al. (2022) and Lin et al. (2022), can provide swift previews and enhance the efficiency of 3D content creation. However, it would be valuable to provide results or examples that demonstrate how TuneMV3D accomplishes this and improves performance and convergence efficiency.\n\n- **Speed Comparison**: As a feedforward network, one of the key advantages should be speed. It would be beneficial if the authors could report training and inference times/speeds. A comparison between the proposed method and other feedforward methods like shape-e, zero-123, and optimization-based methods such as dreamfusion would provide valuable insights.\n\n- **Rationale for SparseNeuS**: The choice of SparseNeuS is mentioned, but there are no results provided to support this design choice. Including some explanation or results that justify the use of SparseNeuS would add clarity.\n\n- **Lack of Quantitative Experiments**: In the introduction, it's mentioned that both qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted. However, the location or presentation of the quantitative experiments is not specified. It would be helpful to indicate where the quantitative experiments and their results can be found in the paper."
