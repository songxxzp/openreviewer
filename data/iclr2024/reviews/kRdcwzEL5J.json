The 3D model for the dataset was collected by flying a UAV over a 2.85 square kilometer area, collecting high resolution imagery, and applying a structure-from-motion method to build a surface mesh, including color texture.  The 3D model is then annotated manually, applying one of ten labels to every point in the mesh.  Source images were also independently annotated with a different set of class labels using a semi-automated approach leveraging segment anything (SAM model) to suggest segmentation.  The 3D model is divided into 93 tiles, and the tiles are divided to training, validation, and testing groups.  Experiments compare a number of recent method for 3D segmentation on this dataset using standard segmentation metrics and comparing the impact of using geometry and color versus geometry alone.\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is the large segmented 3D model, which will be useful in benchmarking future 3D segmentation work."

The size and resolution of this model is quite large.  Constructing and annotating every surface of the mesh manually is an enormous undertaking.  Large, labeled 3D datasets are lacking in the community, so this one could be quite valuable.  The experiments are also useful and set baselines for future experimentation on this dataset.  Overall, the clarity and organization of the paper is good, with some exceptions noted below."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The primary weaknesses of this paper are the choice and definitions of the ten classes, the disconnect and inconsistency between 2D and 3D annotations and classes. Other weaknesses include claims about prior datasets being in a single format, lack of some important details on how the dataset was created, and some formatting issues.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with this paper are the inconsistency of the ten chosen labels and the overlap in what those classes cover.  The chosen labels appear to be a mix of functional classes (like building and road) and landcover classes (like grass and high vegetation).  Some classes seem too specific, like \"Lake\", which probably should be called \"Water\" and include various water bodies.  Some classes seem too broad, like \"Ground\", which seems to be a catch-all for everything not in one of the other classes.  Furthermore \"Ground\" seems to overlap with other labels creating ambiguity.  For example, \"Road\" contains asphalt roads and parking lots, but \"Ground\" also contains asphalt surfaces.  So How do annotators know how to apply these labels in a consistent way?  Similarly, \"Ground\" contains bare soil surfaces which are likely also found in \"Building sites\".  There seems to be a lot of overlap between \"Grass\" and \"Farmland\" definitions as well.\n\nIt's also quite strange that Section 3.4 presents 2D image annotation of the source imagery as an entirely independent labeling task.  It even uses a different set of 18 labels.  As far as I can tell, the 2D annotations are not used later an in any of the experiments.  So why are they included?  It seems like a significant oversight to use different labels for the 3D and 2D annotations and to assign these labels by independent processes.  If the classes were the same it would have been easy to generate the 3D labels from the 2D labels, or vice versus.  It would be very valuable to have a dataset with both 3D segmentation labels and 2D labels that are geometrically consistent with each other.  That is, if you project the labels from the 3D model into the image they are consistent with the 2D labels except in the case of moving objects like pedestrians and driving vehicles.  If Section 3.4 is not consistent with or related to the 3D model segmentation and not used in any further experiments then it is not relevant to the paper and should be removed.\n\nIn the introduction, the second claim about limitations of existing datasets is that these datasets are in a single format (point cloud or mesh).  This is a somewhat weak argument because any dataset that is provided as a mesh can be converted to a point cloud by sampling points on the surface.  This is exactly what is done in this paper.  I suppose the advantage of releasing the data as both a point cloud and mesh is that there is an official version of both the point cloud and the mesh for researcher to use in experiments.  So there is still value in releasing multiple formats, but it's not a big limitation of past mesh models.\n\nThere is some confusion about the number of tiles.  The paper says there are 93 tiles, but 4 are blank and Figure 10 shows the distribution of blank tiles on the periphery of the scene.  It's not clear why there are blank tiles, why there are only 4, and why this is important enough to have a figure showing where they are.  The paper then mentions an 8:1:1 split of training, testing, and validation.  However, it says there are 66 training, 8 test, and 8 validation blocks.  This is not exactly 8:1:1, which is fine, but it might be good to say \"approximately 8:1:1\".  More importantly, this only adds to 82, so what are the other 7 block use for?\n\nAt the bottom of page 8 it says \"our dataset does not perform well on PointNet++ (Caesar et al. 2020)\".  However, Table 2 shows that PointNet++ does perform well and SPGraph performs the worst.  Furthermore the citation of (Caesar et al. 2020) is not correct for neither PointNet++ nor SPGraph.\n\nOther more minor issues are as follows:\n- The paper mentions using SFM to construct the 3D model, but no detail are give about which SFM software/algorithm is used.\n- Fonts in most figures and tables are too small\n- It would be nice if the right of Figure 6 plotted train, test, and validation just like the left of the figure.\n- Figure 7 has the wrong caption, a copy of the Figure 6."

Why not reused the same classes used in prior work?\n\nPlease explain why there is a different set of classes for segmentation of the 2D images and why these are not consistent with the 3D segmentation classes.  Why is there also a different, independent process for annotating 2D images that doesn't seem to benefit the 3D annotations or vice versa?\n\nWhat is the purpose of the blank tiles?  Why are they to begin with created?  Why are there only 4?  Why is their location important (Figure 10) if they are to be ignored?  What is the purpose of the extra 7 tiles that not blank but also not used in training, test, or validation?"

                "value": "1. Unlike most of existing datasets which only provide 3D point clouds, the introduced new dataset also provides 3D meshes for the community. In addition, it also has 2D images together with 2D annotations provided, which would be very useful for potential multimodal learning tasks.\n\n2. The paper sets up the benchmark by evaluating 6 representative methods for 3D semantic learning, which looks great for future researchers."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The new urban-scale dataset looks great and would be beneficial for the community. Nevertheless, there are a number of minor questions:\n\n1. There is a lack of details about the 2D images. For example, does every image has poses annotated? what is the image resolution and sampling density over the 3D arial space? How many 2D images in total? Does the dataset provide the exact correspondences between 2D pixels and 3D points/meshes?  I believe these would be critical if future uses want to fuse both RGB and 3D data for better semantic learning, or even 3D urban-scale novel view rendering.\n\n2. There is a lack of details about the 3D reconstruction techniques. For example, how to find the pixel correspondences before triangulation? How to identify the outliers during 3D reconstruction? How to convert the 3D points to meshes? How about the quality of connected triangle meshes? \n\n3. For 3D semantic annotation, the paper states that \"according to the standard definition of semantic categories\". What is the standard? In fact, it seems the categories \"Road\" and \"Ground\" are quite similar. Therefore, more specifications need to be added to justify your definition of classes. In addition, the paper states that \"assign labels using annotation tools\". What are the tools? and what are the annotation strategies? \n\n4. For 2D semantic annotation, why are only 4336 images annotated? Is it a very small subset of the entire 2D image sequences? Besides, why are there 18 semantic classes on images, but 10 classes on 3D data? Are the 2D annotations aligned with 3D annotations? How about the quality of 2D semantic labels? \n\n5. Figure 2 is a bit blurring. \n\n6. Do the authors get all permissions to release the collected dataset including all 2D/3D data and annotations?"
