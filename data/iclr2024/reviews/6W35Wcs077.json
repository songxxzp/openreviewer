The writing needs to be significantly improved before the paper can be fairly evaluated.\n\nHere are some specific comments:\n\n* The abstract mentions singular value decomposition (SVD) but does not explain what is the entity that its decomposed. The paper later reveals that SVD is used to represent the input image as a matrix.\n* The paper discusses Fourier analysis, but these concepts are not well-explained and their connection to what the authors are proposing is not clear.\n* Many sentences, paragraphs, and sections are difficult to understand. For example, the sentence \"Basically, one straightforward way to implement our idea is to directly perform the decomposition of latent high-dimensional tensor, and conduct the optimization of the decomposed singular vectors and singular value, respectively.\" is unclear and does not explain what the paper is proposing to do.\nSection 3.1, which is supposed to be an overview, is also unclear.\n* The first sentence of Section 3.2 states that \"The singular vector operator is proposed to optimize the degraded singular vectors of the latent representation.\" This sentence is unclear because it does not specify what element is being decomposed or what the latent representation is.\n* The experimental results do not address simultaneous degradations, such as blur + noise + compression. It is not clear how the model would perform in such cases. Additionally, many of the tested degradations are synthetically simulated.\n* Equation (1) does not define the variable W.\n* Equation (4) appears to be a reconstruction loss that enforces the decomposition of the clean image to be close to the decomposition of the degraded image. However, it is not clear if this is the case. Additionally, it is not clear how this equation would be different if Fourier decomposition were used instead of SVD.\n* The paper states that training is done for 1200 epochs. This is an unusually long training in epochs, and it is not clear why it is necessary. \n\nOverall, in its current form, its hard to fairly judge the paper contributions."

In fact, SVD has been used in multiple image restoration works a long time ago, so relating the proposed method with them will be beneficial (and properly acknowledging them seems important).\n\nQ3. Please discuss the computation complexity and its practicality in terms of computation over other prior works. While employing SVD was an interesting idea, its practical computation issue may make this work obsolete.\n\nQ4. It is unclear if most degradations will fall into one of the two proposed methods - see Fig. 2(a) : dehaze yielded similar error for both singular vector and singular value, which may imply that the proposed method may not capture other degradations well including haze."
