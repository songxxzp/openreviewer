The authors augment the BC procedure by incorporating demonstrations provided by the expert, directly into the policy\u2019s decision step. They accomplish this by utilizing a convex combination between the expert\u2019s action for the most similar state encountered in the demonstration set, and the output of a parametrized model approximating the policy. They offer both intuitive and theoretical motivation for their strategy: 1) that past similar experiences can help ground the system\u2019s response to behaviors that have been displayed by an expert and thus avoid drifting into potentially catastrophic state-space areas and 2) offer theoretical guarantees  that indeed the system\u2019s output is constrained within a desired area according to the provided hyperparameter L. MCNN requires that a subset of the available demos be organized in a particular form of memory buffer, referred to as Memory Code Book throughout the work. . Selected demonstrations are structured into a graph G, where each node is connected to its nearest neighbor according to some provided distance function d, defined over the state space, and the edge stands for the action used to transition to that nearest neighbor. They argue that within this framework, only a subset of the training data is required to craft graph G. This graph G, is then used to craft a function F(x) that locates the nearest known state s to x, and outputs the action a that the expert has demonstrated from that state. Using a convex combination between this action a, and the action a\u2019 the policy network predicts for the input state x, the system finally outputs the action a_final as the predicted action for state x. Finally the policy network\u2019s parameters are updated by standard Stochastic Gradient Descent, using a loss signal over the predicted a_final and the expert action for state x.\nThe method is then compared to several BC based approaches over 5 simulated tasks where reward signals are known and can be used to provide quantitative assessment."

In addition, the baselines selected are reasonable as this work aims to improve the behavior of BC methods. Finally, they offer adequate implementation details in their appendix.\n\nTheir method is predicated on a simple yet elegant idea: use expert demonstrations as a human-like memory of experiences to constrain the output of a BC model. In this manner the output is kept within a reasonable distance of the known state space. This, assuming good coverage provided by the expert, can significantly reduce compounding errors that can affect BC techniques (i.e DAGGER). Additionally, the system can potentially better handle not-too-dissimilar unseen states by virtue of projecting them to the known state space via the  nearest neighbor function capability.\n\nSound theoretical justification for the work\u2019s motivation. Essentially the authors argue that by integrating known state-action  information into the decision process directly they can constrain the output range of the system. They also provide reasoning as to why the code book can only be a subset of the total amount demonstrations, as long as it is crafted in a sophisticated manner. That is, the code book can be small enough to facilitate  fast inference, as long as the selected state-actions are good representatives of the known state-action space."

                "value": "The main weakness of this work, as is common with BC approaches, is assumption of representative state-action pairs and optimal behavior provided by the demonstrator. There is no insight as to how the method will behave with reasonably suboptimal demonstrations, as it being a BC based approach has no apparent mechanism that enables it to focus on the better demonstrations of a provided set. \nThere is recent interest in work that can discern between useful demonstrations and harmful / irrelevant ones that can inhibit training. (i.e TREX, or Subdominance minimization (Ziebart 2022)). While understandably not the direct focus of this work, it can be inhibiting for complex tasks to assume a plethora of very carefully curated demonstrations that are both optimal and extremely descriptive of the entire problem space, hence the aforementioned attempts to augment imitation learning with such capabilities.\n\nIn the same direction, there is no experimentation for generalization. For example, with demonstration provided for task A, how would the method perform for a slightly altered task A\u2019 there perhaps the goal has changed slightly, the demonstrations are perturbed by noise or simply slightly different. It is not unreasonable to believe that this method would not perform poorly in such a setting and good results would strengthen the method\u2019s appeal considerably.\n\nFinally, the distance used to select the nearest neighbor, is quite critical for this method and problem specific. For example, the distance needed for an image-based problem could be quite different from a control state-based problem. This can potentially deduct from the appeal of a traditional BC approach that doesn't need such an engineered mechanism. See question 1 and 3 below. (The authors have clarified that the distance used is a generic L2 distance across all problem spaces considered.)\n\nHaving revisited the sections pointed out to by the authors, on the parts that I had concerns, namely the generalization aspect and the problem specific distance metric, I believe this work can have utility in the low data data sample regime, and thus I have updated my rating."

Do you know why this is the case? It seems unintuitive that 5% would perform worse than both 2.5% and 10%. Do  you think that the number of memories needed to attain sufficient performance is related to task/behavior complexity?\n3) It seems like there might be a relationship to critical/important states which exhibit a large difference in the expected reward between the best and worst action, i.e. it is costly to recover from a mistake in a critical state.
