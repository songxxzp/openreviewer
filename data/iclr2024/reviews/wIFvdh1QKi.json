                "value": "The paper introduces a concept called \"magnitude\" for metric spaces, serving as an invariant to measure the effective size of a space across various scales. This magnitude considers both geometric and topological aspects, making it useful for unsupervised representation learning tasks. The authors propose a dissimilarity measure between magnitude functions of finite metric spaces, offering a stable quality assessment for dimensionality reduction tasks. The measure proves stability under data perturbations, is computationally efficient, and facilitates a thorough multi-scale comparison of embeddings. Experimental results validate the measure's utility. The paper establishes a scale-invariant framework for quantifying the difference between magnitudes, links this difference to embedding quality, and demonstrates empirical effectiveness on simulated and real data."

Without incorporating measures of uncertainty, readers may question the generalizability of the experimental findings to the broader population and the long-term effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n- Lack of Statistical Analysis: The paper seems to lack a robust statistical analysis of the experimental results. Statistical analyses, such as confidence intervals or hypothesis testing, are crucial for establishing the reliability and significance of the observed effects. Without this, the strength of the experimental evidence may be undermined.\n\nAddressing these weaknesses through the inclusion of statistical uncertainty measures and a more rigorous statistical analysis would strengthen the paper's overall credibility and enhance the confidence readers have in the validity of the experimental results."

The technical difficulty is trivial. When I check the theoretical results in lemmas and corollaries, it seems that most of them are very straightforward conclusions from the corresponding definitions (the proofs are actually very short as shown in the appendix).\n\n3). The motivation and experiments are not very solid to me. The effectiveness of unsupervised dimensionality reduction can already be evaluated by their original loss functions such as distance preservation and reconstruction error. Why do we still need the magnitude difference to validate their effectiveness? Second, how such a new space metric help us in our algorithm desgin? For example, can we integrate this new magnitude difference into exsiting unsupervised learning to obtain some better dimensionality reduction results? I was looking forward to seeing these results but I failed to find any of them in the experiment section."

                "value": "The first point of concern is that I do not know what the paper is trying to argue. If the claim is that the proposed method is an indicator that can determine whether it is a good dimensionality reduction or not, it is necessary to clarify what makes it a good dimensionality reduction. If this were global isometry (which seems to be the case from the theorem that follows), then the experiments should be compared in this light, but this does not seem to be the case. The experiment seems to be just an observation, and I am not sure if the proposed method is a good one.\n\nThe second concern is in terms of novelty: the magnitude function is already known and the difference defined is the simplest one. It should be clarified whether the introduction of Magnitude into the evaluation of embedding performance is novel or whether the construction of a specific indicator is novel. \"Our contribution\" section seems to indicate that the evaluation of the experiment and the proof of the theorem are additional contributions. Whichever points are novel, it should be clear why they are necessary. The motivation for introduction is written, but it is similar to the first point that it should be clear why the proposed method is superior.\n\nThird, it is unfriendly to readers in several respects.For example, \n- The main proposal in this paper appears to be Def. 4.2 and 4.3, but it is written in a way that makes it unclear that it is a proposed method. Fig. 2 helped me recognize this point, but it would not be sufficient as a document. (Is it a typo that in Fig.2 it is Magnitude function difference, but in Def.4.2 it is Magnitude profile difference?)\n- It seems to me that Def4.3 must assume that the X and Y components are aligned correspondingly, but it does not say that. (Otherwise, they are not unique according to the order.) There is a reference at the beginning of Section 4, but it does not specify that the alignment condition is a prerequisite."

                "value": "- Regarding the definition of re-scaled in Def.4.1, it is multiplied by $t_{conv}$, but seems to emphasize scale more. Is $s/t_{conv}$ incorrect?\n- Scale-invariant is claimed as an advantage of the proposed method, which I believe means that it does not require the setting of hyperparameters in the neighborhood. On the other hand, magnitude measures global features when the scale parameter is small and local features when it is large. In the end, the proposed index is considered to be the sum (average) of the differences in features calculated by varying the hyperparameters by some rule. From this perspective, even with the conventional method that requires hyperparameter settings, the objective can be achieved by changing the hyperparameters and taking the sum (average) of the calculated values. Is there any reason why scale-invariant can be achieved because of Magnitude?\n- From a representation learning perspective, affine transformations, i.e., enlargement and reduction, are not so essential differences. From this perspective, it would be more valuable for the proposed method to be an indicator that the expansion and contraction can be automatically ignored by re-scaling."
