A common belief is that increasing the number of iterative solutions (inner iterations) during inference improves performance. This study challenges that notion, providing a theoretical analysis that highlights overparametrization as a crucial factor. The findings reveal that overparametrized networks, like DEQs, don't benefit from extra iterations at inference, while meta-learning does."

First, this definition seems problematic because when $N$ changes, $\\theta^{\\*,N}$ should change. In other words, we should not fix $\\theta^{\\*,N}$. Second, this is on training loss, not the test loss. The relationship between training loss and test loss is not trivial, especially when overparameterized. In the paper, the authors claim that \"This quantity is a proxy for the increase in test loss, provided we have access to enough training data\", which I doubt since the meaning of \"enough training data\" is very vague (or even contradictory) in the context of overparameterization."

In implicit deep learning, the network must _implicitly_ minimize the objective $\\ell(z(\\theta))$. Specifically, the network parameters $\\theta$ control some intermediary output $z(\\theta)$ which tends to be the solution of some inner rootfinding problem $f(z, \\theta, D_{train}) = 0$. The solution $z(\\theta)$ is often identified through some $N$ fixed-point updates during training, then during test time, the solution is updated using test data using more fixed-point updates. This helps in certain applications like meta-learning and not others like DEQ. \n\nThe paper attempts to prove that this difference (helping in certain cases and not others) can be explained by the degree $\\theta$ is overparameterized for the inner problem. They prove lower bounds for how much the training loss can change when changing the number of fixed-point iterations for an affine inner problem."

                "value": "- As already pointed out by the authors, there is a major inconsistency between what the paper tries to prove and what is actually proven. During inference, the inner optimization is conducted on the _test data_. However, the paper\u2019s results are only showing how the _training_ loss can fluctuate with the number of inner optimization updates. The problem with this relaxation is because it interferes directly with the paper\u2019s core result, that network overparametrization is why more inner optimization steps do not help. One can imagine in the overparametrized setting, the test loss/inner problem could be significantly different from the training loss/inner problem, causing an analysis on just the training loss to fall apart. I may be misunderstanding the paper however, and so I vote for a low score with low confidence.\n\n- I think the authors can be more precise about what they mean by overparametrization. Formally, they do define it as $d_x < d_\\theta$ in Corollary 1, but it might be good to clarify how $d_x$ scales for the different applications (DEQ, meta-learning) in the main body. Is this definition related to the classic usage of the term \u201coverparametrization\u201d as the number of parameters being larger than the number of training data in linear models? And the word overparametrization is a bit thrown around loosely in the paper. \n\n- Figure 4 plots $D(N, \\Delta N)$ of the training loss for different levels of \u201coverparameterization\u201d which they measure using the training loss (lower training loss \u2192 more expressive model). They conclude from the experiment that \u201cThe lower the training loss, the higher the $D(N, \\Delta N)$\u201d. This comparison seems a bit unfair and requires normalizing $D(N, \\Delta N)$ with respect to the training loss. For a loss lower bounded by 0 (like most losses), if the training loss is already small, the lowest possible improvement with more fixed point iterations $D(N, \\Delta N)$ obviously gets smaller. \n\n\n- There\u2019s some minor spacing issue of Figure 2"
