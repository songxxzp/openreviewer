The problem of quantum kernel auto-designer defined by the authors is only a special case of QAS. QAS has attracted continuous attention with numerous algorithms trying to solve this problem (see a small survey on this problem [1]). The state-of-the-art method [2] on QAS has thoroughly examined their algorithm on both VQE problems and quantum kernels (using MNIST as well). It is unclear why we should focus on only the quantum kernels instead of the general QAS problem.\n2. [3] proposed a very similar QAS approach compared to this paper and [3] is not even mentioned in this paper. It is highly suspicious since the authors cite 7 other papers from the group (or more specifically from Yuxuan Du). The proposed approach is too simple with no novelty at all.\n3. The experimental results are weak and lack a proper comparison. Not a single baseline from all the QAS methods is unacceptable since [2,3] and many other QAS papers all take quantum kernels as one of the testbeds for their QAS approaches. The authors constantly mentioned that the work aims to \"greatly improve the power of quantum kernels under NISQ setting\" but they are not considering noise models or quantum devices.\n\n\n[1] QAS-Bench: Rethinking Quantum Architecture Search and A Benchmark\n\n[2] QuantumDARTS: Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search for Variational Quantum Algorithms\n\n[3] Quantum circuit architecture search for variational quantum algorithms."

                "value": "1. The author mentioned that part of the advantage of the quantum kernel comes from its being computationally hard to evaluate classically. However, the quantum kernel proposed in this paper relies on an explicit quantum feature map, meaning explicit quantum gates and quantum circuit encoding. From my view, on NISQ devices with fewer qubits and shallower quantum circuits, such a quantum feature map is not computationally hard to evaluate classically. Therefore, the reviewer believes that the quantum advantage of the proposed quantum feature map in this paper is not readily apparent. Providing a theoretical explanation rather than solely relying on empirical demonstration would make the argument more convincing.\n\n2. In the field of quantum machine learning, optimizing both the circuit structure and the parameters of variational quantum gates for specific tasks has been previously studied. Papers [1] and [2] introduced a completely differentiable quantum architecture search (QAS) framework, avoiding the vast circuit structure search space, which the reviewer considers one of the issues faced by the proposed QuKerNet in this paper. \n\n3. While transfer some ideas of QAS to quantum kernel methods can be considered one of the contributions of this paper, the reviewer believes the methods of QAS utilized in the paper are somewhat outdated and lack timeliness. For instance, methods based on reinforcement learning [3] and sample-free approaches [1,2] might enable the model to learn better quantum feature maps.\n\n4. In the experimental settings of this paper, the number of utilized quantum bits seems somewhat limited (up to a maximum of 8 qubits). While the reviewer acknowledges that simulating computing overheads on a moderately sized number of qubits can be computationally intensive (even supercomputers struggle to simulate just over 30 qubits in full amplitude simulation), it is believed that the use of only 8 qubits is insufficient to demonstrate the computational gap between quantum and classical kernels. The reviewer is pleased to see more experimental results on a larger number of qubits.\n\n[1] Wu W, Yan G, Lu X, et al.
