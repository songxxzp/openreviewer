In this case, previous semi-supervised learning methods, which heavily rely on labeled data, are no longer applicable, showing low data efficiency. The author proposes a method for selecting high-quality data based on the average confidence and aleatoric uncertainty of historical predictions during the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can identify reliable data, improve the data efficiency of semi-supervised learning, and adapt to different pseudo-labeling algorithms."

To tackle this issue, a Data-centric Insights for semi-supervised learning (DIPS) framework is proposed.

Selection metric for the \u2018useful\u2019 data samples among the unlabeled data pool is of central interest in active learning. The term \u2018usefulness\u2019 can include various criterions, such as confidence and uncertainty (as in this work), coverage, diversity, and etc. In that sense, more comprehensive discussions and comparisons on selection metrics are expected. Related to this issue, how the quality and diversity (e.g., class distributions) of the selected training samples change for every generation?\n\n- Choice of the threshold parameters $\\tau_{\\text{conf}}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{al}}$ seems to be very important. For example, highly tight thresholds (i.e., high $\\tau_{\\text{conf}}$ and low $\\tau_{\\text{al}}$) will remain only a few samples for training likely to be correct and abundant samples yet include noise for the vice versa. As the proposed algorithm is not designed to make a correction on the mislabeled samples but filter potentially harmful examples, exploring such trade-offs between remaining data proportion and performance depending on the thresholds will be valuable. \n\n- Considering the computational aspects, it could be nearly free when the scale of unlabeled data is relatively small (i.e., in vision domain, CIFAR-10/100). In other words, when the scale of the unlabeled dataset grows large (i.e., million-scale samples such as ImageNet), computational overheads caused by evaluating labeled and pseudo-labeled examples with all checkpoints in previous rounds cannot be ignored.\n\n- Although the presented work mainly targets semi-supervised learning on tabular data, baselines have been taken only from the image domain and comparison with SSL methods specific to tabular data such as [J.

It is well known that with small amount of labeled data (not even relative to the unlabelled, but itself, say 1k-10k images, 10min-10h of speech) it is very problematic to train pseudo-labeling algorithms with good quality due to both weak initial teacher and other training dynamics. I suspect complicated dependency between label noise level and amount of labeled data (besides amount of unlabeled data) which authors do not investigate in depth.\n- Absence of simple basic baselines where we apply straightforward the label noise methods to labeled data and perform standard teacher-student training. \"In such situations, as shown in Fig. 1, noise propagates to the pseudo-labels, jeopardizing the accuracy of the pseudo-labeling steps\" -- if we could train on small amount of labeled data with any method of learning with noisy labels then first teacher will be strong. It is not shown in the paper that all prior methods of learning with noisy labels fail on small amount of labeled data in supervised learning and thus sec 3.2 first part is overstated.\n- \"PL methods do not update the pseudo-labels of unlabeled samples once they are incorporated in one of the $\\mathcal{D}_{train}^{(i)}$ -- authors incorrectly (check out e.g. Xie, Qizhe, et al. \"Self-training with noisy student improves imagenet classification.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2020) formulate teacher-student pseudo-labeling widely used and thus overstated issues in second part of sec 3.2. On the next iteration of teacher-student training all unlabeled data are relabeled, some selection based on confidence or/and uncertainty is applied to pseudo-labels and then labeled data and these new pseudo-labeled data are combined (or labeled data can be skipped) to train new student model. I never saw in prior works on any teacher-student training (when new student is trained from scratch on new data) for images, text and speech input data that old pseudo-labels (from older teacher) are used along with new ones (with latest teacher).\n- Absence of empirical analysis showing that confidence filtering of labeled data is not enough and aleatoric uncertainty is necessary. Also there are no baselines with widely used uncertainty-based filtering for pseudo-labeled data to be used for labeled data -- motivating usage of aleatoric uncertainty.\n- Absence of empirical justification of the proposed selection method for unlabeled data only, as then we also have mislabeling and thus it should be effective there too assuming all labeled data are correctly labeled. It could be also that maybe proposed selection is only needed for labeled data while any prior selection methods could be used for unlabeled data.\n- Paper conceptually messes up between teacher-student PL methods and the ones when one model continuously trains on data with time-to-time regenerated pseudo-labels by either EMA model or by previous model states. These two approaches have different training dynamics and problems (e.g. second one is less stable). \n  - Training of \"greedy PL\" in sec. 5.1 (which is the latter type of PL methods) is out of initial formulation of PL in sec 3.1. Moreover, there is no results in Fig 3 for the zero corrupted samples, it seems PL itself it not improving upon supervised training in this toy example which is strange (looking at x=0.1)\n  - Baselines in sec 5.2 are a mixture of both methods, which is not aligned again with formulation in sec 3.1.\n  - Algo 1 in Appendix A does not cover the second approach, e.g. greedy PL method."

                "value": "- I do not agree entirely with statement \"labeled data are noisy\" as if labeled data are very limited in a lot of applications we could ask for the golden (correct) labels, as we need only small amount. \n- \"application: these works use pseudo-labeling as a tool for supervised learning, whereas DIPS extends the machinery of pseudo-labeling itself.\" I don't see really huge difference here, as noisy labels means - we don't know the correct label, so mathematically it is very close tasks and solutions.\n- why do we use checkpoints for the learning dynamic being epoch and not some parameter based on number of iterations? For very large data we will never do 1 epoch, or only 1 epoch, or only few and thus measure based on epochs will be weak. From appendix info it is not clear even what checkpoints are selected and how this selection important.\n- did authors try to exclude some first epochs from confidence and uncertainty definition as they could be not very informative?\n- I don't understand this statement \"Recall aleatoric uncertainty captures the inherent data uncertainty, hence is a principled way to capture issues such as mislabeling\". Why does aleatoric uncertainty capture mislabeling? Why def. 4.2 is aleatoric as we consider variation across checkpoints (= over learning process)? \n- What is the upper bound (when all data are labeled and when all data are labeled and correct / w/o mislabeling) in Fig. 4?\n- How many iterations are done for teacher-student baselines in Fig. 4?\n- This statement is incorrect \"Note that s is solely used to select pseudo-labeled samples, among those which have not already been pseudo-labeled at a previous iteration.\" in both types of algorithms like greedy PL and UPS we relabel and reselect pseudo-labeled data.\n- How the parameters of the baselines in Appendix B1 are found? Why it is not adopted per dataset? I see that aleatoric uncertainty is adopted per dataset, which could be unfair parameters selection for the baselines.\n- B 3.1, 3.2 what does it mean T=5 for greedy PL and for UPS? Could authors describe exactly how they do PL for both algo with 5 iterations? Does it mean that for UPS it is 5 teacher-student trainings and for greedy PL 5 teacher-student trainings with each student training based on the original prior work where we continuously train model?\n- What will happen if ablation in C2 is done only for labeled data selection and unlabeled data are selected based on PL prior works?\n- What is the percentage of selected data by every method, including authors', on every iteration?\n- What about Fig 11 with vanilla PL but w/o any data selection?"
