However, a post-processing step is still conducted. I was wondering about the advantage of the proposed method compared to those that directly apply the post-processing algorithm to the discrete diffusion models.\n2. Several layout generation related works [1-3] are neither cited nor discussed in the paper.\n3. For the overlap constraint, the current loss pushes elements away from each other. However, in some cases, designers would intentionally use overlap to make the top element look closer to the viewer. For example, text elements are often located above the image elements in banner ads. The usefulness of such a constraint would be questionable by directly applying it to all elements in graphic designs.\n4. Why the evaluation metrics do not consider overlap, while the aesthetic constraints contain the overlap in layout?\n\n[1] Zheng, Xinru, et al. \"Content-aware generative modeling of graphic design layouts.\" ACM TOG, 2019.\n[2] Zhang, Junyi, et al. \"LayoutDiffusion: Improving Graphic Layout Generation by Discrete Diffusion Probabilistic Models.\" ICCV 2023.\n[3] Jiang, Zhaoyun, et al. \"LayoutFormer++: Conditional Graphic Layout Generation via Constraint Serialization and Decoding Space Restriction.\" CVPR 2023."

The method outperforms other layout generation models, as well as generic models such as MaskGIT, as measured by FID score and the IoU-related metric.
