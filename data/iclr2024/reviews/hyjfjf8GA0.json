Perhaps this is in part due to my lacking certain pieces of background, but I do feel like I am at least somewhat in the target audience of this paper. Here are a few writing concerns, in no particular order.\n\n1. Many technical terms are not defined, some of which are fundamental to understanding the paper. These things ought to have formal, mathematical definitions considering their importance to the paper. Some examples:\n\n    a. Sec 2.1: What is a \"population\", and what does it mean for a population to be \"heterogeneous\"? \n\n    b. Sec 2.2: What is \"gradient exchange\"?\n\n    c. Sec 2.2.1: I understand x and y to stand in for a^i and a^ii respectively. Is this accurate? In any case this should be stated.\n\n    d. Sec 3: \"Generalist\" should be defined formally\n\n1. Should I be considering a partially-observable game, or a fully-observable game? The prelims suggest partial observability, but e.g. policies are conditioned on states, which suggests full observability\n1. My understanding is that the setting is a two-player zero-sum game. In that setting, a player should never correlate its action with the opposing player, i.e., the mutual information (8) should always be 0 in equilibrium. Why, then, is it interesting to consider (or, indeed, to optimize) the mutual information?\n\nThe experimental results seem reasonable, but my ability to parse them is essentially limited to \"I see figures in which the current paper seems to do well\".  \n\nDue to the writing issues alone, I don't think this paper is publishable in the current state. I vote to reject. If the authors could perform a revision that improves the quality of writing and explanations, I would read such a revision and may change my score. \n\nNitpicks (not affecting evaluation):\n\n1. $*$ should probably not be used as a generic multiplication symbol---prefer $\\cdot$ (or simply juxtaposition)\n1. Some brackets are improperly sized, e.g., Eq (3)\n1. Sec 2.2.1: Shouldn't the integral be actually a sum, since at the end of the day these training algorithms operate in discrete time?\n1. $\\log$ should always use the backslash, i.e., not $log$.\n1. It's a bit confusing to use Roman numerals to index the players; why not just use standard Arabic numerals (1, 2, ..., N), as is consistent with most game theory literature?\n1. Preliminaries typo: $S : O \\times O$ doesn't parse\n1. The paper contains a large number of grammatical errors, too many to enumerate. Proofreading would go a long way.\n1. Eq (10): it should be explciitly stated that $\\mathbb H()$ is the joint entropy (assuming that it actually is)."

An explicit connection to mutual information right after Equation 7 is helpful for understanding the claim \"The exchange of Policy Gradient between two agents results in the implicit maximization of their Mutual Information (MI) over time. \"\n2. Similarly, there seems to be a typo in Equation 10 (another key result). In addition, the terms in this equation have not been explained immediately following this equation, making it hard to understand the intuition.\n3.  While the paper has emphasized the disadvantage of \"generalist\", the proposed method (at least, Equation 10) still depends on the policy of the \"generalist.\"  Does the proposed method rely on the existing method to learn the policy of the \"generalist\"?  How does the proposed method strike a balance between being a \"generalist\" and being a \"specialist\"? Will this matter in certain scenarios? The discussion on these issues is not adequate."
