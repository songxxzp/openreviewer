The framework uses a constrained variational generation (CVG) approach, which generates new graphs for classification based on the original graphs and a latent variable. The generation is optimized under the guidance of the graph information bottleneck (GIB) principle, which balances the trade-off between label relevance and distribution invariance. The paper leverages the variational graph auto-encoder (VGAE) structure as the generator and provides theoretical analysis to justify the GIB-based objective. The paper also conducts extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graph datasets and demonstrates the superiority of the framework over state-of-the-art baselines."

The idea is simple, while the motivation is not well discussed. Compared with the graph information bottleneck method, the authors try to generate graphs rather than continual representations to learn essential information correlated with labels. I may be concerned about what is the benefits of this additional step, in other words, why the generated discrete graphs are better than continual representations in retaining invariant information.\n3. The experimental results appear somewhat constrained, with only four graph-level datasets. More extensive experimental analysis could be helpful. For example, how are the generated graphs relevant to the label information, can the noised edges be prevented in the generated graphs? Especially for the SP-Motif dataset, more cases and illustrations would be better."

General strategies for OOD problem is extracting the invariant subgraphs which most informative of the class labels. However, the authors identify, such techniques fail to adequately address the challenges of intra-graph correlations, wherein partial correlations are present which may not be invariant and inter-graph distinctions, wherein invariant substructures may not be informative for the class labels.  The authors propose to address these challenges by devising a generative framework instead of subgraph extraction, while preserving the class label information. To achieve this, they optimize a approximate variational objective with the principle of the graph information bottleneck. The experiments indicate the effectiveness of the approach."

Are there any relations to the graph structures generated in C with the class labels? Do we see similar C graphs for same class labels?\n1. The learning can be made stronger if we have supervision for generation. One of the datasets, SP-Motif, does contain the actual supervision for C. It would be interesting to see if there gains to be made with supervision signals instead of the self-supervised loss in generation.\n\n\nIn summary, the proposed method is interesting and seems to make reasonable contributions to the study of OOD generalizations.

It's just a descriptive property that is not sufficient enough to tell which part of the component contributes the experimental improvement.\n2. It's lack of case studies to show what kinds of generated graphs that exist in test but not in training data. It seems like the generation task just serves as a regularization but not for generating meaningful graphs or molecular structure.\n3. The presentation still needs a further improvement. Some notations are not clear enough. For example, in Equation (13), should $\\beta_{ij}$ be $\\alpha_{ij}$? If not, please give a clear justification. In Equation (14), it's not clear about how to get the hidden representations of C and C_i. As we can see that f() maps the graph representations to class distribution, then what do you mean the representations of C and C_i are learned by f()?"
