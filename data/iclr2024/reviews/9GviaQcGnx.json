The authors address the optimization of CPR by an adaptation of the augmented Lagrangian method and provide a simple mechanism to adapt the upper bounds during the optimization. The experimental results speak in favor of the proposed method."

The method is also robust against different design choices of $\\kappa$."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- Although it is a very interesting paper, I feel like the analysis is not good enough. There are many interesting aspects that could be further explored IMHO. For example:\n1. If $\\lambda$ is used to accumulate constraint violations, shouldn't it be $\\lambda_{t+1}=\\lambda_t + \\mu(R(\\theta_t) - \\kappa)^+$? \n2. Have the authors considered adjusting $\\lambda$ in a non-linear way? For example $\\lambda_{t+1}=\\lambda_t + \\mu f((R(\\theta_t) - \\kappa))^+$, where $f$ is a non-linear function. Maybe it leads to faster convergence if tuned properly?\n3. Should $\\lambda$ have a self decay factor? Similar to a diverging behavior with large learning rates, when a feasible point $\\theta_{t}$ is found at a very large $\\lambda_t$. In the next iteration, $\\theta_{t+1}$ may overshoot in the opposite direction and becomes infeasible again because $\\lambda_t$ has not yet become small enough.\n\n- The experimental setting is not very clear to me. What is the percentage of correct labels in the Object Detection experiment? Is the \"Object Detection\" actually classification on CIFAR100? As \"Object Detection\" is a well-established field itself, I found the terms very confusing. \n\n- How significant is the performance difference between CPR and weight decay? As the absolute performance difference is not huge, it would be great if the standard deviation of different runs of the same setting can be provided. \n\n- Maybe I missed it, but how about a baseline of weight decay factor dependent on the magnitude of the parameters, e.g. larger weights leads to a larger decay coefficient (linear or non-linear dependence)? I wonder how well this could achieve the goal of the proposed method.\n\n\nMinor:\n- Equation 6 should have $\\kappa^j$ rather than $\\kappa$ \n- The authors claim that the method is not sensitive to $\\mu$, but it would still be great to see the analysis on it.\n- Better to use consistent notations. E.g. in Figure E1, fix -> Kappa-K, dependent -> Kappa_kI0, warm started ->Kappa_Is\n- Larger scale evaluation, e.g. on image-net, would be strongly advised."
