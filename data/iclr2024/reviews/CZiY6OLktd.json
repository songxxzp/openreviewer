In general, MG-TSD controls the learning process of the diffusion model by leveraging the temporal signals in time series data at different granularity levels. In particular, the authors link the forward process of the diffusion model to the data smoothing process. Motivated by this, this work develops a multi-granularity guidance diffusion loss function, such that the inherent features within data can be preserved and a regularized sampling path can be achieved. Experiments on real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Do you utilize a sliding window to roll the time series to build the context and predict intervals? Do the consecutive context/predict intervals overlap or not?\n\n3. More experimental results are expected. For instance, the authors only evaluate the time series forecasting methods under one length setting in each dataset, like the setting of context-24-predict-24 is utilized in Solar, Electricity, Traffic, Taxi, and KDD-Cup datasets.\n\n4.
