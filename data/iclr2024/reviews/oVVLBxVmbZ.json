It is mathematically interesting.\n\nThe challenge arises since at each stage the RL agent has to decide which feature to intervene and also with what value. To address this challenge, the RL agent will leverage a structural causal model. Then, it would perform conditional interventions, i.e., interventions conditioned on the parents of that feature. Ultimately, the goal is to obtain a counterfactual that will respect the SCM and also be as close to the original point as possible in fewer steps than the number of features changed. Additionally, they require the number of interventions T to be less than p which is the number of actionable features.\n\nThey have included relevant baselines in their experiments, and show time benefits."

Is this done for the proposed method as well?\n\nI also wonder if RL is a bit of an overkill for this problem since the number of features (p) is often quite small. It is often desirable to intervene on fewer features. For instance, the experiments drop the feature Capital Gain since intervening only on that one feature suffices for recourse. Also, what about exploration? Could the authors strengthen the motivation behind this approach? \n\nAnd also, how is the time being calculated in the experiments? It seems to be only the inference time. What about preprocessing time? Could the authors discuss/elaborate on the preprocessing time of various methods?\n\nThe experiment section does not provide enough details on how the causal graph was generated for the real-world datasets and if that causal graph is reliable.\n\nUltimately, human evaluations might also be necessary at some point to compare different methods."
