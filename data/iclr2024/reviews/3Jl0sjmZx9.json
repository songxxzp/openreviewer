Then you need to a train vision encoder/decoder to find pathologies with desirably accurate results on new images to generate an initial report.\n\n4, Doing clinical diagnosis on these findings and comparing the current findings to previous studies to derive the temporal change information (you need to build a classifier according ontology for dignosis and image matching/alignment modules by tracking these findings over time).\n\n5, forming a report and providing means (hyperlinks) for human physicians to inspect and accept and edit the report.\n\nThe above steps are logically impossible to bypass if you want to build a useful clinical assist tool in the real world.
