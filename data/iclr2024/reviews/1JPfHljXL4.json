Based on that, equation (2) presents a last iteration problem-dependent regret bound. However, the chosen $w_t$ does not satisfy the independent assumption, which means equation (2) does not hold. How you argue this setting of $w_t$ still minimizes the bound?  What is the impact here? \n3. What is the definition of median_filter? How it ensures the gradient norm sequence does not change significantly after refinement?\n4. It seems that the theory is weak, only useful in a heuristic way.
