                "value": "However, there are some concerns of this paper.\n\n- One of the most important issue is that there is another work named PotNet[1], already published one year ago, proposed a method to calculate infinite summations for node pairs in crystal structures. The core idea in this paper of calculating the first attention bias ($\\alpha$ ones) capturing infinite interactions between two nodes of this paper are very similar to PotNet. But the similarity is not mentioned, and comparison is not provided. Besides the first attention bias ($\\alpha$ ones), the second attention bias ($\\beta$ ones) is not new. It can be seen as the summation of local radius features.\n\n- The derivation in the appendix might be problematic, the authors use word \"may be\", which is ambiguous. If authors want to use Equation (S14) in the Appendix to derive the first attention bias, which is one of their major contribution, the coefficient in the reciprocal space needs to be properly derived. \n\n- The paper uses \u201ccomputationally tractable\u201d in many places, but the error bound of the summation is still unknown to me. Particularly, the authors say if the $\\sigma$ of $\\sum_n e^{-\\frac{\\Vert r\\Vert^2}{2\\sigma}}$ or $\\sum_n \\Vert r \\Vert e^{-\\frac{\\Vert r\\Vert^2}{2\\sigma}}$ has an upper bound and lower bound then is tractable. If it is tractable, then what is the exact error between the authors\u2019 evaluation and the value of every summation $\\sum_n e^{-\\frac{\\Vert r\\Vert^2}{2\\sigma}}$\n\n- The performances of the proposed method is not very significant without the additional stochastic weight averaging (SWA) (Izmailov et al., 2018) by averaging the model weights for the last 50 epochs with a fixed learning rate. If with this module, the comparison is not that fair, but without this module, the performance gains are not very significant. \n\n\n[1] Efficient Approximations of Complete Interatomic Potentials for Crystal Property Prediction.

To completely capture the periodic structure of crystals one would effectively require infinitely connected attention, which is intractable, prompting the papers to introduce a new attention method to effectively manage this requirement using a distance based decay.\n\nThe papers starts by introducing the problem of crystal structure property prediction and discusses recent approaches, including GNN-based neural networks and a couple of transformer models, specifically Matformer. The paper then introduces a set of preliminaries, including description of crystal structures and the self-attention mechanism. Subsequently, the authors describe the different components of Crystalformer with a focus on the attention formulation called pseudo-finite periodic attention that encodes relevant crystal information. Next, the authors describe distance decay attention, which applies a Gaussian decay function to place less importance on atoms that are further apart from each other and thereby simplifies the need for infinitely connected attention to a tractable problem. The authors describe relevant details of their attention formulation and distance decay function before outlining their network architecture consisting of multiple attention blocks.\n\nIn Section 4, the paper described related work in detail and emphasizes how Crystalformer differs from various competing approaches and showcase experiments on Materials Project and JARVIS in Section 5. The experiments in Section 5 show that Crystalformer generally outperforms relevant GNN and transformer baselines for both datasets. Next, the paper provided a set of ablation studies related to removing positional encodings and performing attention in Fourier space."
