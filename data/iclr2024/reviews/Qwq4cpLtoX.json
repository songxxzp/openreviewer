Typically in the regime of large language models, primarily transformer based models have been scaled up and shown to shine in ICL, but the authors show that other architectures are also capable of performing ICL, and some even better than transformers in the settings considered. To fairly test for ICL, authors train all the models from scratch, following the setup of Garg et. al (2023) where training is done on a suite of different supervised learning setups. The authors provide a clear answer that most of the architectures are capable of performing ICL and this phenomena is not specific to transformer based models, and also provide an interesting revelation of state-space models performing better ICL capabilities, which would be quite useful as such models do not incur the same computational costs as transformers."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the authors have done a fantastic job on studying different tasks and model architectures, I found some of the core components lacking. For example, details about how the context input is encoded and provided to the models is missing, as well as an explanation and hypothesis of why certain transformer based models do better than the others, and what the differences are. I have listed some of my specific concerns below, and would be happy to raise my score if they are addressed.\n\n- Since the macro perspective is only studied in the language modeling domain, it would make more sense to move the write-up around it under the Language Modeling section.\n- It would be nice if the authors could provide a write-up on the differences between the various transformer-based and state-space based models for completeness. In particular, why does one model based on transformers (eg. LLAMA2) give better ICL performance than the other (eg. T5).\n- How does this contrast to the already present information that Transformers can do ICL considerably well? The experiments in Table 2 seem to show that attention-based models are fairly poor at ICL but Garg et. al (2023) and Muller et. al (2022) show that they do quite well.\n- Details about how data is processed for image classification is missing. Do the experiments use embeddings obtained from ResNet on images to get a set of vectors and labels as context, or are the models given raw pixel information in some way?\n- While Figure 1 is interesting in showing different models undergo learning in different ways, is there any commonality here? For example, do these trends hold over all kinds of tasks considered?\n- A lot of the performance of transformer-based models depends on how the data is represented in the context. Providing additional implementation details about how data is represented for each experiment as well as how training is done would be helpful.\n- There is also a lot of interesting ablations in the appendix of the paper on different kinds of transformers (eg. Decoder only vs Encoder-Decoder). Insights about differences between such models is more fundamental than differences between small architectural changes between different named architectures, and thus a detailed comment on them in the main section would be nice.\n- The authors should consider citing the following works which are directly related to ICL.\n\n**Citations missing**\n\nGarnelo, M., Schwarz, J., Rosenbaum, D., Viola, F., Rezende, D.

Instead, presenting both the success and failure cases and carefully comparing the settings/conditions for failure cases to occur may provide more insights to the community. I do not expect the paper to find the essential reasons for a certain architecture to fail in in-context learning, but more ablation studies on various training settings/hyperparameters are encouraged and at least some reasonable hypotheses can be made to explain the failure cases. The authors have some discussions on the unexpected low performance of BERT and T5, which I greatly appreciate. However, this is not enough, and I hope to see a more comprehensive picture of how various factors affect the in-context learning ability.\n2.\tWhen introducing the image classification task on Page 4, the definition of \u201cbursty\u201d and \u201cnon-bursty\u201d samples are unclear and not self-contained.
