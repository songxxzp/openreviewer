To address this issue, the authors propose the AR-coreset, which restricts itself to a local sublevel-region and considers the cost ratio. This new measure allows the authors to obtain refined estimates of $\\hat{P}$. The authors demonstrate that $\\hat{P}$ is a (1+nd)-coreset and a (1+kd)-AR-coreset of $P$, meaning that $\\hat{C}$ is a (1+nd)-approximation and a (1+kd)-approximation solution, respectively."

The paper considers the most apparent approach: compute a coreset for the perturbed version, and use it directly as a coreset for the original dataset. The paper showed the following results:\n1. The coreset from the noisy dataset can be very bad for the original dataset, in terms of the relative error Err commonly used to measure a coreset's approximation quality.\n2. The authors notice that the traditional measure (the relative error mentioned in 1) is too strong because it is the supreme over all possible center sets, while in practice people is more interested on how well the coresets can approximate costs for \"not so bad\" center sets. This motivates the authors to design a new relative error $Err_{AR}$ (which they call \"approximate error ratio\") that only takes supreme only over center sets that approximates the optimal solution. \n3. The authors show that this new definition of relative error can help give tigher approximation ratio estimation for center set computed on the coreset (obtained from the noisy dataset). In particular, a coreset $S$ with large Err can have much smaller $Err_{AR}$, which means a good approximate solution on $S$ will also have a small cost on the original dataset. While if we use $Err$ for estimation, the bound obtained is much looser."

It would be great if the authors can show a quantitive analysis on the dependence between the separation and the two assumptions. For example, would it be possible that when the data become less balanced / well-separated, the two measures $Err$ and $Err_{AR}$ converge to each other. (My gut's feeling is the degree of well-separation could likely have a non-trivial effect on $Err$ / $Err_{AR}$). If that's the case, I feel this would somewhat strengthen the paper's result since $Err_{AR}$ can be viewed as a unifying measure that's tighter in extreme parameter ranges."
