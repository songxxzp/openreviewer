It would be great to add other black-box methods (in addition to random search) to Table 1.

This dependence could be a potential weakness, as the model might not generalize well to novel or highly specialized architectural search spaces.\n- The paper focuses on CIFAR-10 and NAS-bench-201 for performance evaluation. While these are standard benchmarks, the scope of testing could be broadened to include more diverse and challenging datasets. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of LLMatic's capabilities and potential limitations, especially in real-world scenarios or more complex tasks.\n- The paper could benefit from ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of LLMatic to its overall performance.\n- The writing should improve."

How can we prove that LLMs have the prior knowledge about NAS tasks as described in the paper?\n- The input sequence length of current LLMs is limited, but the number of networks evaluated in one experiment exceeds 2000. Is this a major problem, and how do you address it? Or would you consider incorporating the search history into the prompt to assist NAS?\n- Why randomly pick a prompt as an action at each step? Why not design prompts that allow LLMs to choose the action by themselves?"
