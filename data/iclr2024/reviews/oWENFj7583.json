                "value": "The paper presents a method to generate synthetic SAR images via finetuning diffusion models to overcome the limited availability of annotated SAR data for classification problems. The domain gap between RGB and SAR images includes both a viewpoint variation, being SAR aerial and a modality variation related to the statistics of SAR data. The method uses two-stages of LoRA finetuning to bridge this gap, separately addressing the two issues."

The two-stage approach to adaptation, while important for problem, is minor and of interest only for a niche audience. Overall, the clarity of the paper can be improved. For example, the presentation of the method is often intertwined with experimental details. \n\nExperimental evaluation is also problematic. The FID metric is not suitable for SAR images, since it is a distance in the latent space of an ImageNet-trained neural network, thus having a large domain gap (some works point out that the ImageNet prior affects evaluation even of RGB images, nevermind SAR, see Kynk\u00e4\u00e4nniemi et al. \"The Role of ImageNet Classes in Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance\"). The F1 score of the downstream classification task is a relevant metric but the results are difficult to understand. For instance, Table 2 does not report the F1 performance of the baseline without augmentations."

The first stage involved training an ORS LoRA module on ORS datasets to adapt from a regular view to an aerial view without changing data modality. In the second stage, a SAR LoRA module was trained on SAR datasets to further adapt from RGB modality to SAR modality. Notably, the second stage introduced a prototype LoRA (pLoRA) to address class imbalance issues in SAR datasets. The pLoRA clustered SAR training samples based on their features, with each cluster representing a specific SAR imagery prototype, and individual pLoRAs were trained for each cluster. These pLoRAs were weighted and combined to enhance the synthesis of minor classes, resulting in a more coherent transition from regular-view RGB images to aerial-view SAR images."

The paper's pioneering use of large-scale pre-trained generation models for synthesizing non-visible light images is a notable technical contribution, allowing the transfer of pre-learned semantic knowledge from regular images to SAR data despite significant domain gaps."

Can the authors provide a more detailed discussion or experimentation comparing their proposed 2LoRA and pLoRA methods with other state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques for SAR imagery? It would strengthen the paper's contribution and help assess the novelty and effectiveness of their approach.\n\nThe authors designed their own dataset, which may have inherent biases. Have the authors considered testing their methods on publicly available SAR datasets to provide a more generalized evaluation? This would enhance the external validity of their findings.\n\nOne key aspect that the authors could explore is the practical implementation of the generated data from their proposed methods in real-world applications. This would not only provide a tangible demonstration of the utility of their techniques but also make the research more relevant and applicable to various domains, such as remote sensing, defense, or environmental monitoring."
