It requires certain assumptions that may not be present in typical robotic environments, such as the need for global coordinate systems and uniform sampling. The method might not be readily applicable to more complicated, dynamic environments.\n\nMore concretely:\n- The algorithm requires additional assumptions that may not be readily available or applicable in common robotic tasks, such as locomotion and manipulation planning. These assumptions include the need for global coordinate systems, obstacle-free environments, and environment-specific policy learning. The method's effectiveness is contingent on these conditions, which are not always present in more complex or dynamically changing real-world scenarios. Additionally, the challenge of generating globally optimal paths and dealing with the complexity of Finsler geodesics further limits its applicability to standard reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n- In the original wording, the paper mentions that the method \"only works well locally since we assume that manifolds have global coordinate systems and the continuous midpoint property may be satisfied only locally. For the generation of globally minimizing geodesics, we may have to divide manifolds, train policies for each local region and connect locally generated geodesics.\" It also states that \"the policy has to be learned for each environment. By modifying our method so that the actor and critic input information on environments, it may be possible to learn a policy applicable to different environments.\" These statements highlight the limitations regarding the need for specific geometric and topological assumptions that may not hold in typical RL tasks in robotics.\n\nA line of work on quasimetric distance for goal-conditioned RL seems related, which could provide important context and benchmarking.
