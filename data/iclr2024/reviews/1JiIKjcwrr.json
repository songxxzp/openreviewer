A more detailed comparison with foundational works like [1] and [2] would better position and differentiate the paper's contributions within the field. \\\nW2: The paper introduces pivotal hyper-parameters alpha and beta without substantial exploration or practical guidelines for their optimization. This oversight diminishes the model's real-world utility. Incorporating a mechanism for their automatic adjustment, possibly based on mutual information or a related metric, could substantially augment the method's practicality. \\\nW3: The robustness assessment is limited, focusing on feature masking and edge-dropping. This narrow scope fails to fully stress-test the model's resilience. Expanding the range of adversarial challenges, including sophisticated strategies like MetaAttack [3], random feature corruption, or edge manipulation, would offer a more holistic robustness evaluation. \\\nW4: There is no substantial discussion on the model's computational demands. For real-world applications, particularly in larger, more complex networks, resource constraints are a vital consideration. The absence of this evaluation is a missed opportunity to understand the model's performance in resource-restricted environments.\n\n\n[1] Ma, H., Liu, Z., Zhang, X., Zhang, L., & Jiang, H. (2021).

Moreover, the proposed method improves performance by designing the optimal module suited for learning the topology and features, without sacrificing the performance of one modality to reflect the characteristics of the other modality."

The proposed method aims to separately learn the information in the graph topology and node features by the contrastive learning module and the knowledge graph embedding module, respectively. However, the knowledge graph embedding module seems also involves in the node features.\n\n2. The novelty of the proposed method is relatively low. The contrastive learning module is the same as the InfoNCE loss in previous methods. Moreover, directly align the topology-based representations and feature representations seems not very reasonable.\n\n3. The proposed method lacks theoretical analysis. For example. Why the proposed method can outperform the previous methods, are there any theoretical supports?\n\n4. Does the proposed framework in this paper really enable topological maps and node features to complement each other, and are there any case studies to validate this?\n\n5. The writing of the proposed method needs more improvements, and the manuscripts needs more proofreading. For example, \nin page 6, \"six Self-supervised heterogeneous models\" should be \"six self-supervised heterogeneous models\".\nIt's best not to take a direct screenshot of the framework figure.\n\n6. Too few comparison methods, especially lack of 2023 updates.\n\n7. This work was not provided in code, making it difficult to measure its reproducibility.\n\nBased on the above comments, I think that the work does not meet the ICLR thresholds."

While it is mentioned that BFTNet separates graph topology and node features, allowing for improved performance, there is no in-depth analysis or explanation provided regarding how this separation enhances interpretability or facilitates understanding of the underlying relationships within heterogeneous graphs. This lack of clarity may hinder researchers' ability to fully comprehend and utilize the insights gained from using BFTNet in their own studies.\n3. In Experiments, It appears that this paper achieves dominant performance over baselines. However it does not directly point out how to get the results. Is it the maximum value or the average value? Besides, although it is stated that source code for implementing BFTNet will be made available in future versions, at present it remains unavailable, which limits reproducibility.\n4. This paper uses masking node features and dropping edges to verify robustness. However, these two ways are too simple. More test, such as Meta attack [1], is needed."
