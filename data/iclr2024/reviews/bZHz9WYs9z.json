However, there exists a plethora of molecular generative models since the work of Verma et al., 2022. Just to list a few examples, one could consider STGG (Ahn et al., 2022), GDSS (Jo et al., 2022), Digress (Vignac et al., 2022), and GraphARM (Kong et al., 2023). The authors could even consider SMILES-LSTM (which demonstrates surprisingly good performance) for more comprehensive baselines. \n\n### Lack of justification \n\nI was unable to find a good justification for why the proposed flow network better generates heterophilious graphs. The only explanation I got was that \"binary masking ensures that only part of the input is transformed, allowing the model to retain certain features while altering others, enabling the flow to capture intricate data distribution characteristics\". I do not understand why retaining certain features is related to \"capturing intricate data distribution characteristics\"."

The level of homophily in a graph is defined based on node labels in GNN literature, where high homophily is observed when neighboring nodes share the same labels, and vice versa. However, In the design of the paper\u2019s heterophilious message passing layer, i.e., equation (6), they define the homophily of nodes as the cosine similarity between pair node embeddings. This could be problematic since the cosine similarity between pair node embeddings might not align with their labels. As a result, the proposed model may inherently fail to work well in the cases that the cosine similarity between pair node embeddings is not aligned with their labels.\n\n 2. Numerous GNN architectures have been developed for heterophilic graphs, where they have been demonstrated their effectiveness for heterophilious graphs comes from their ability to work as high-pass filters. However, there is no solid justification indicating that the proposed heterophilic flows can effectively handle heterophilic graphs. Additionally, it is also not clear that the benefits of the designed heterophilic flows, as compared to directly adapting existing heterophilic GNN structures for molecular generalization. More discussion here would be helpful.\n\n 3. Lack of ablation studies on different components. The proposed model consists of several components, including bond flow and heterophilious atom flow. Moreover, the heterophilic atom flow encompasses three interacting flows: the central, homophilic, and heterophilic flows. It remains unclear which component is most crucial or how each contributes to the model's overall performance. A detailed breakdown and analysis would provide greater clarity.\n\n 4. The paper claims that existing GNN models for molecule generalization have overlooked the repulsions between dissimilar atoms and are vulnerable to oversmoothing. However, it is not evident that the proposed model effectively addresses the oversmoothing issue. It would be better to provide more explanations on this and conduct experiments to validate the oversmoothing claim.\n \n 5. Given that this study seeks to address the challenges of heterophily and oversmoothing in GNNs for molecular generalization, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into papers on GNNs concerning heterophilious graphs and oversmoothing problems in the related work section."
