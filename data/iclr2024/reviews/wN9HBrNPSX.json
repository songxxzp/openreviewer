The author mentioned a lot of related work, but in the end only one method was selected as the basic model for the experiment. Such an experiment does not prove that the enhancement method proposed by the author is universal.\n\nW3. The method is too simple.

Since global similarity is used to enhance the representation of entities, why not just cancel the incremental training setting and train the representations of all entities together from the beginning?\n\nQ4. Generally speaking, incremental training only reduces training costs and should not be more effective than training from scratch. If you want to use incremental training to enhance the effect of TKGC, is this starting point wrong?"

Models proposed to solve this problem need to take into consideration the requirement for generalization and assimilation to new knowledge, and the sparseness or connection between newly introduced entities. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose an incremental training framework specifically designed for temporal knowledge graphs, a unique enhancement layer that can be integrated with various GNN-based temporal knowledge graph completion methods, and a weighted sampling strategy during the training process which emphasizes the connections of infrequent entities. The experimental setup contains two versions of ICEWS datasets, link prediction tasks (overall, inductive), hit@k and MRR evaluation metrics, and the comparison methods that include the baseline model (Titer) with three variations (FT, ER, EWC) and three proposed variations (weighted sampling, enhancement layer, full). The results show the overall improvement in the model when utilizing the proposed enhancement layer and the proposed weighted sampling."
