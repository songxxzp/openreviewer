In the first stage, a graph variational autoencoder is trained to produce embeddings of different architectures on the cell level. The authors add a margin loss comparing architectures using zero-cost proxies to encourage the architectures to cluster. The resulting latent space is clustered using a gaussian mixture model. \nIn order to sample architectures given a well-performing reference architecture in the high dimensional latent space of the VAE, the authors employ a conditional, continuous normalizing flow model. In order to create the macro architectures, the authors propose to fine-tune a decoder-only generative transformer model on architectures found via evolutionary optimization, which uses a zero-cost proxy for its search. \nThe authors demonstrate competitive performance with both aligned methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as well as overall NAS methods on Imagenet."

NAS as a field often relies strongly on well-designed search spaces. Design of such search spaces is non-trivial especially in new domains and research areas. This paper addresses this disadvantage by  exploiting an extremely large, general-purpose search space efficiently, by training a two-level\nhierarchy of generative models. First level of the conditional generative process focusses on micro-cell design using conditional continuous normalizing flow and the second level uses an transformer to sequentially model the macro architecture. What makes this approach effective in these larger spaces is the ability to exploit task-agnostic zero cost proxy scores to pre-train the generative model. The method is evaluated on the cifar10, cifar100 and the imagenet1-k dataset."
