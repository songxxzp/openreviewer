I do not have a background on mechanics, physics, vibrating plates and acoustics; at the same time, I have never worked with operator learning, Fourier neural operators, and frequency domains in the context of artificial intelligence. Therefore, I lack the literature knowledge and experience from both the applied and methodological domain explored in this paper, making it impossible for my review to be useful for a proper evaluation at a conference like ICLR.\n\nI have alerted the ACs to seek an opinion from a different reviewer.\n\n----------------------\nUPDATE: At the author's rebuttal, I was provided to an answer to what was a key weakness I've understood from the paper (seemingly only one test set). Instead, I was given results based on a cross validation procedure that I believe to be reasonable. Based on this, I change my rating from 6 to 8 (accept)."

The experiments (as, for example, seen in table 2) include one more \"traditional\" machine learning model (i.e, kNN). This is quite positive in the context of a area that sometimes forgets to compare new developments with simpler methods that might provide similar results. Although, from what I could understand in Appendix, this is based on an low-dimension embedding from a deep learning autoencoder model.\n4. The paper provides an ablation analysis in Appendix."

Furthermore, the command in the README under \"Train a model\" section is not correct as the paths do not correspond to the folder structure. The setup script does not provide specific versions for the packages being installed (except for pytorch's cuda version) and, thus, this will impact the reproducibility of this work.\n2. The experiment results are conducted in what it seems to be a single test set, and not through some sort of cross validation procedure to understand the variation and relevance of the results depending on the datasets' splits.\n3. The datasets are synthetic, and do not seem to come from real-world measures. I understand from the paper that this is cost prohibitive, and that is why this new dataset is relevant, but I got the impression that this applied domain has implications in the real world, and therefore I'd guess and experiment in a real-world dataset, even if small, would be relevant."

How easy the plate geometries can be acquired? The proposed beading patterns may not be easily gotten, and probably frequency or speed is probably easy to get. This discussion is required and is essential in this paper.\n\n2. What's the distance between the simulations and the data collected in the real world? If the authors can conduct some experiments on real-world equipment, it would be very great.\n\n3. The mesh geometries in this paper are not represented in vector form, and they are blurred. This should not happen and should be fixed in the rebuttal phase.\n\n4. Why does Table 3 not have baselines' performances? It's better to test baseline methods on the transfer learning setup as well, and this is very critical.\n\n5. It seems that the visualization of Figure 6 is not very good because (b) and (d) are not very similar. Also, I think it's better to add baseline comparisons or even videos (videos can be provided in the supplementary or the anonymous link).\n\n6. The mechanical model should be put into the main text and linked to the dataset construction or methodology. This is very essential in the PDE domain.\n\n7. What do grid-based models mean, and why is FNO not based on grids? I think FNO should have an option to work in regular grids. If grid-based methods are stronger, then FNO should also be put in the similar mode."
