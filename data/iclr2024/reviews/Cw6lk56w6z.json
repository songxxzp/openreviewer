Most of these focus on information extraction (IE), and as pointed out in previous work [1], IE tasks are not generally considered in most instruction-tuning datasets. Therefore, IE tasks are not only specification-heavy but also unfamiliar to these instruction-tuned models. A simple investigation/baseline should involve manually curating specification-heavy but familiar instructions such as:\n\nThe output length should not exceed X length, the output should start with\u2026, the output should be in a JSON format, among other considerations.\n\nThese specifications are likely to arise in user cases or training data and are also specification-heavy. This provides a further disentanglement of the root of this inability. Also, ,ore interesting discussions may occur in this direction. For example, can general specifications assist complex task-specific specification understanding? And vice versa?\n\n[1] Zhang et al, Aligning Instruction Tasks Unlocks Large Language Models as Zero-Shot Relation Extractors. Findings of ACL 2023.\n\n\n2.

Firstly, in Figure 2, how do the authors attribute the errors made by LLMs to the three types of reasons? Is there a chain-of-thoughts or any monologues to help identify the reasons? It seems to me that the example presented in \"unspecific context understanding\" can also be attributed to \u201cMisaligned Schema Understanding\u201d.  One possible explanation is that the model noticed the \u201ctackor\u201c but didn\u2019t treat it as \u201cproduct-car\u201c, because the task instruction missed important information about the class \u201cproduct-car\u201c. Secondly, some important experimental details are missing. What are the prompts of Figure 3 for different models? What is the \"specification\" in a prompt and how does its length vary? Besides, does the performance drop come from the longer context or the content of the specification?\n2. What is the scope of \u201cspecification-heavy tasks\u201d? This paper primarily focuses on traditional IE tasks (16 out of 18 tasks). However, there is no clear boundary of \u201cspecification-heavy\" tasks in this paper.  In my opinion, most of NLP tasks involve \u201ccomplex\u201d annotation guidelines if we would like to elaborate detailed task descriptions and edge cases. Could the authors provide a clear definition of \"specification-heavy task\" or at least some examples of opposite tasks? It's also possible to narrow the scope of your paper to IE tasks, without losing generality.\n3. The instructions for different tasks are too simple. At least the definition of different entity/relation types should be provided."

Using 18 benchmarks (6 different task types) and six LLMs (FLAN-UL2, Alpaca, Vicuna, ChatGPT, Davinci003 and GPT-4), the paper demonstrates that few-shot ICL significantly lags behind the SOTA of each task. Manual analysis highlights three reasons for that poor performance: 1) inability of the ICL+LLM approach to understand specifics of the context, 2) lack of task schema comprehension, and 3) limited LLM ability to understand long context. The paper then confirms that the poor performance is due to the ICL approach itself rather than the capabilities of the LLM by fine-tuning FLAN-UL2 specifically for each task and showing accuracies that outperform SOTA. The paper argues that the current LLM alignment datasets do not well cover complicated specification-heavy tasks. Via supervised fine-tuning, the paper aligns FLAN-UL2 using the corresponding training  data of each task (leaving one task out for evaluation) and shows gains in accuracy compared to that obtained before alignment."

The alignment experiments in Section 4.2 only hold out one task at a time, but still tasks of the same type are included in the alignment dataset.

Performance of `instruction + demonstrations`\n\nThe effectiveness of prompts that include both 'instruction and demonstrations' might be enhanced if large language models (LLMs) are specifically trained with such prompts. This training approach could potentially improve their performance on these tasks.\n\n3. Labels covered in demonstrations are important.\n\nIt's crucial to show how demonstrations incorporate all labels in the label space. \nTypically, k-shot learning implies presenting k examples for each label. \nIf the demonstrations are limited due to the constraints of input context length, this could understandably lead to lower performance.\n\n*[1] Larger language models do in-context learning differently., Wei et al., 2023 \\\n[2] Rethinking the role of demonstrations: What makes in-context learning work?., Min et al., 2023 \\\n[3] Large Language Models as General Pattern Machines., Mirchandani et al., 2023*"
