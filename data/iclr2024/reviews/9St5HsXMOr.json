The authors introduce an automatic framework named Long-range Meta-path Search through Progressive Sampling (LMSPS).

The method involves developing a search space with all target-node-related meta-paths and then progressively shrinking this space. The approach is guided by a sampling evaluation strategy, leading to specialized and expressive meta-path selection.

If we can grasp these short-range meta-paths, then by using a compositional approach, we can understand long-range meta-paths.\n3 Finding meta-structures that work effectively across various HGNNs is a tough task. It appears even more challenging to make long-range meta-path searches effective across different HGNNs. In contrast, short-range meta-paths might be more adaptable to various HGNNs.\n4 The core idea revolves around creating a search space filled with all target-node-related meta-paths, which is then gradually reduced.

                "value": "**W1. Some of the statements in this paper seems to be inconsistent or need further clarification.**\n  \nIn Section 1, the authors argued that 'the receptive field grows exponentially with the number of layers' (for metapath-free HGNNs). Moreover, the authors also argue that many GNNs (e.g., for homogeneous graphs) tried to explore long-range dependency and gained some benefits. From my perspective, the step/range of a path is equivalent to the number of GNN layers in some cases, which indicates that the exploration of long-range dependency may still cause the issue of exponentially grown receptive field. As I known, many real-world graphs follow the property of 'six degrees of separation' (i.e., the average diameter of many real-world graphs would not be very large). In particular, when the path length and number of GNN layers are large (e.g., >>6), all the nodes may be in the receptive field centered at each node.\n  \nThe availability of graph attributes (e.g., in terms of node attributes or edge attributes) is not mentioned in the problem statements of Section 2. However, as stated in the 2nd paragraph of Section 5.1, each node is associated with raw features. Details regarding graph attributes are also not described in Table 8.\n  \nIn Section 3, the authors argued that existing methods (e.g., GTN, HGT, HAN, HPN, MEGNN, GraphMSE, etc.) automatically select a proper set of metapaths but are not as effective as the full meta-path set. However, according to my understanding, the proposed method still does not use the full meta-path set.\n  \nIn Eq. (2), I am still confused about how to derive $\\{ \\alpha_k \\}$. Are they model parameters to be learned or they are derived based on $\\{ {\\bf{X'}}_k \\}$? If they are learnable parameters, it seems that the corresponding scale is related to $K$, which may still grow exponentially with the increase of path length.\n  \nThe training loss shown in Eq. (6) includes the training and validations sets, which seems to be different from the standard supervised learning paradigms. It is suggested to highlight such a new paradigm (e.g., using formal math notations) at the very beginning of problem statements (e.g., in Section 2).\n  \nWhat are the training losses for 'LMSPS' and 'LMSPS+label' in Table 2? Does 'LMSPS' mean that it is trained with an unsupervised/self-supervised loss? If so, what is the definition of this loss? According to my understanding, the proposed method is supervised, which relies on the supervised loss as illustrated in Eq. (6). If so can the proposed method be extended to the unsupervised/self-supervised paradigm, where we could only train the model based on the original graph topology and attributes without any label information?\n  \nWhy there are no results for 'LMSPS+label' and 'LMSPS+label+ms' in Table 3?\n\n***\n\n**W2. According to my understanding, the authors only tested the proposed method using the transductive setting of node classification. Its ability to handle the advanced inductive inference (e.g., for new unseen nodes and across graphs) was not validated in experiments.**\n\n***\n\n**W3. Some of the statements in the paper breaks the anonymity of this submission during the review period.**\n  \nThe authors claimed that their method ranks 1st on the leaderboard of ogbn-mag in OGB (as shown in https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/leader_nodeprop/). However, by checking this web page, I now clearly know the names and institutions of all the authors, which breaks the anonymity of this submission."

            "summary": {
                "value": "This paper aims to solve meta-path instance selection for heterogeneous graphs. Two observations of existing works trigger the model design, including (1) only several meta-path instances dominate the model performance, and (2) some meta-path instances cause a negative impact on the performance. Therefore, the paper proposes a search algorithm to search meta-path instances from all possible instances and use simple MLP to predict labels after finishing searching paths. Compared with meta-path-free models, meta-path-based models, and NAS-based models, the proposed model consistently performs the best."

The contribution of each meta-path instance is not clear. Will the searched long-range path have a negative impact on performance?"
