Unclear Motivation: The paper posits that UniPoint-LLM is distinct from traditional text-to-3D methods due to its ability to handle \"unlimited prompt inputs or unconstrained parameters.\" However, existing methods such as TextMesh [1] and DreamTime [2] have demonstrated capabilities in processing long and flexible descriptions. This raises questions regarding the necessity of introducing MLLM for handling unlimited texts.\n\n2. Lack of Experiments: The authors assert that UniPoint-LLM is advantageous for vision understanding and 3D generation. Nonetheless, the section on vision understanding lacks quantitative results, particularly a comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art method JM3D [3] on benchmarks like ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN. Additionally, the qualitative results presented for 3D generation are sparse. The experiments, as they stand, fall short of substantiating the claimed contributions.\n\n3. Novelty: The proposed adjustment of substituting the text encoder in established methods like PointE [4] with MLLM appears to be incremental, and does not evidently constitute a novel contribution.\n\n[1] TextMesh: Generation of Realistic 3D Meshes From Text Prompts, arXiv:2304.12439, 2023\n\n[2] Dreamtime: An Improved Optimization Strategy for Text-to-3D Content Creation, arXiv:2306.12422\n\n[3] Beyond First Impressions: Integrating Joint Multi-modal Cues for Comprehensive 3D Representation, ACM MM23\n\n[4] Point-E: A system for generating 3D point clouds from complex prompts, arXiv:2212.08751"

It's unfortunate that there isn't a more extensive experimental evaluation, akin to what's presented in works like JM3D [1] or ULIP [2]. Could you provide more detailed results to substantiate your claims?\n\n2. I am curious about whether the integration of MLLM introduces additional computational overhead. Are there any quantitative metrics available to gauge the trade-off involved?\n\n3. It would be beneficial to elucidate the distinctions between UniPoint-LLM and other LLM-based 3D models such as JM3D-LLM [3] and Point-LLM [4]. At a glance, there seems to be substantial overlap among these works. Could you shed light on the unique contributions of UniPoint-LLM in this context?\n\n4. It's noted that the foundation of MUTS is a pretrained transformer block. Could you specify the dataset on which this block was trained? Furthermore, do you believe that employing this pretrained block is a judicious choice for subsequent training, especially given the mixed data of images and point clouds involved?\n\n[1] ULIP: Learning a unified representation of language, images, and point clouds for 3D understanding, CVPR 23. \n[2] JM3D & JM3D-LLM: Elevating 3D Representation with Joint Multi-modal Cues, arXiv:2310.09503. \n[3] PointLLM: Empowering large language models to understand point clouds, arXiv:2308.16911."
