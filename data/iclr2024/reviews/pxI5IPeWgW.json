Thus, the paper seems to tackle a novel task. However, it is completely unclear because the motivation is not sufficiently described, the paper is not well structured, the problem setting is not clearly presented, and many important descriptions are moved to Appendix."

                "value": "(A) Problem setting is unclear\n\n- First of all, in Section 1, please clearly state that what the ODE discovery task is and what its goal is. Otherwise, the readers cannot understand why it yields interpretability. \n\n- It is unclear whether time $t$ is defined as continuous or discrete. For instance, in Section 2, \u201cat $t \\in [T]$\u201d seems to say that the value of time $t$ is discrete and it is included in index set $[T]$. However, for example in Assumption 2.2, \u201ctime point $t \\in [0, T]$\u201d seems to say that it is continuous.\n\n- In Section 3, \u201cwe assume that time-varying features and outcomes \u2026 are discrete measurements of underlying continuous trajectories\u2026\u201d is unclear. I could not understand what is discrete and what is continuous. Do you imply that trajectories are defined at continuous time and their observations are measured at discrete time? Or do you mean that the values of features and outcomes are continuous in ODE models, but their observed values are discrete? Similarly, \u201cdiscrete (or continuous) treatment plan\u201d is unclear to me. This makes the paper extremely difficult to follow.\n\n- Eq. (3) introduces function $g$, and the authors say \u201cit is known and is often assumed to be the identity.\u201d Why? \n\n- Please separate the paragraph at \u201cThe goal of ODE discovery is \u2026\u201d in Section 3. Please do not mix the proposed problem setting and the existing one in the same paragraph, which is hard to follow.\n\n\n(B) The technical soundness is unclear\n\n- **Assumptions**: I could not understand why the authors say that \u201cAssumption 2.2 can be relaxed with Assumptions 3.1 and 3.3.\u201d  I could not see what the point of Discrepancy 1 is. It simply says that \u201cthe assumptions in treatment effect estimation do not correspond one-to-one to those in ODE discovery,\u201d which seems trivial. It is hard to follow.\n \n- **The soundness of employing ODE discovery methods**: Although the proposed method employs the existing ODE discovery method (called SINDy), it is unclear what this method does and how it works. What is the advantages and the limitations of this method? How can we choose the existing methods? \n\n- **Ability to express the variability of each subject**: The authors seem to simply change the constant values in simple ODE models to express the variability across subjects. Can we really always express the treatment and the outcome curves with such a simple strategy, given that the continuous time series data often involve complex dynamics?\n\n(C) The difference from existing ODE-based treatment effect estimation methods is unclear in the main paper\n\n- Please briefly summarize the description of \u201cDynamical systems, ODEs, and treatment effects\u201d in Appendix B.1 in the main paper. This will make the motivation of this paper clearer."

Compared to existing black-box TE methods (like neural-network based architectures), the authors claim that the main contribution of this work is a human-readable, interpretable framework. But if the current form of the manuscript only offers empirical validation, I feel that its contributions might not yet meet the threshold of ICLR conf. I wonder that have authors investigated the inherent theoretical properties of the ODE-based framework (which is a white-box model compared to deep network)? e.g., for certain nonlinear differential equations, the solution might be chaotic, meaning it's highly sensitive to initial conditions $\\boldsymbol{x}_0, \\boldsymbol{v}$ and treatment plan $\\boldsymbol{a}$ at $t_0$. \n\n3. Given the claimed emphasis on 'human-readability', how does the proposed method facilitate better decision-making or insights for practitioners in the field is still unclear. Addressing these concerns with more discussions on closed-form ODE would further enhance this work.\n\n4. Minor issues don't affect the rating:\n\n- page 8: $\\gamma = 0$ corresponds no time-dependent -> add 'to' for consistency\n\n- Table 5: word 'Intrepetible' -> 'Interpretable'\n\n- there's one paragraph exceeds the 9 pages limit of the main body\n\n- the full name of ODE/ODEs appears many times in the text, which seems unnecessary"

As time changes, different patterns of $\\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ may emerge over the interval from $t_0$ to $T$.\n\n- In practice, what method do you use for solving ODEs?

                "value": "The paper proposes the Individualized Nonlinear Sparse Identification Treatment Effect (INSITE) framework for estimating heterogeneous time-varying treatment effects given dynamic and statist covariates. INSITE leverages deterministic ODE discovery methods to infer the population differential equation, which is fine-tuned to recover patient-specific differential equations. Experimental results on two synthetic datasets demonstrate that INSITE is competitive in counterfactual prediction relative to baselines."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- I encourage the authors to include a discussion section focused on the limitations of the proposed approach. The paper makes strong assumptions about the underlying dynamics, e.g., \n1) The success of the INSITE is dependent on the choice of the library of candidate functions\n2) INSITE assumes that the system is sparse, which rarely holds in high-dimensional settings\n3) INSITE assumes that the system is deterministic and noise-free. However, real-world systems often have noise and other stochastic elements, which can significantly affect the model's accuracy.\n- I encourage the authors to include a complete description of how INSITE handles different treatment types (categorical and continuous ). Given that this setup is distinct from the previous ODE discovery methods, complete details should be provided in the main paper\n\n**Underwhelming Experiments**\n- While the paper claims to handle irregularly sampled data, which is typical in real-world settings (i.e., patient covariates are not measured continuously over time), the synthetic experiments don't seem to explore this scenario\n- The synthetic experiments are too simplistic, $g(x)$ is an identity function, $x$ is 1-dimensional. I encourage the authors to explore more challenging scenarios, including semi-synthetic datasets"
