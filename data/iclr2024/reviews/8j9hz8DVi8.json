The technique is well motivated and provides theoretical/experimental proofs/explanations for all the claims in the paper (convergence guarantees, basic properties of kronecker product/sum and Loewner order)."

What is the target for tuning hyperparameters if the plots show validation performance?). \n- seems unclear how to extend this method to layers that are not fully-connected\n\n### Minor\n- first page sentence ... \"..to be at one end of this sequence\" confusing"

This is something that seems to exist in the context. See for example, Fig 1 \"unit-wise\" preconditioning in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04684.pdf.\n- Are the 300 hyperparameters optimized for each method or only for caspr? What is the target for this hyperparameter tuning? Validation accuracy is the performance reported so is the grid search optimizing that value?\n- Why are there no error bars included? Could the experiments be run on at least 3 seeds? Without a single rerun, the results could be random."
