            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The motivation seems to be Ambiguous. The paper's definition of backward reasoning essentially frames it as a fill-in-the-blank task, rather than a genuine backward reasoning or a broader sense of causal reasoning. In reference [1], a similar task is merely a sub-task in backward verification for verifying forward reasoning. The authors have repurposed it as a new backward reasoning task, which seems redundant and lacks research value. The paper's discussion on the practical application scenarios of this task is insufficient, making it challenging to discern its real-world significance. Moreover, the rationale behind comparing the difficulty levels of backward and forward reasoning remains unexplained.\n2. Lack of Methodological Novelty. The three primary methods presented are essentially repurposed from forward reasoning techniques that have been previously introduced and widely applied in other works. The authors have essentially transformed backward reasoning into forward reasoning, without designing specific methods tailored to the unique characteristics of backward reasoning, thereby undermining the essence of studying backward reasoning. Specifically:\n-----The \u201cRephrasing\u201d method aligns closely with the \u201cCondition Mask Verification\u201d method from reference [1]. This should have been treated as a baseline rather than a novel approach due to its lack of originality.\n-----The \u201cPAL-Tools\u201d method is fundamentally the same as the method introduced in reference [2], with the authors merely employing the SymPy library for solving for \u2018x\u2019. This approach lacks innovation.\n-----The \u201cReprompting and Verification\u201d method is essentially an inversion of a method from reference [3] used to verify the correctness of forward reasoning, which seems like a forced novelty.\n3. While the paper presents a range of experimental results, the depth of analysis behind these results is lacking. For instance, the paper doesn't delve deep into the differences between various prompting techniques and why certain techniques are more effective in specific scenarios. The comparative analysis mostly revolves around forward reasoning methods, lacking a direct comparison with potential backward reasoning techniques, making it difficult for readers to gauge the true advantages of the proposed methods.\n4. The authors' modifications to the datasets GSM8k, SVAMP, and MultiArith are minimal, merely replacing numbers in questions with blanks. However, they claim to have created \u201cnew datasets\u201d, which seems to exaggerate their contribution.\n5. The paper contains many grammatical errors. One is the missing period at the end of the paragraph \u201cIn order to establish \u2026 on this task\u201d, and the second is the incorrect punctuation in the paragraph \u201cA forward or the typical \u2026 numeric value of the blank\u201d with the misplaced colon in \u2019half.\u2019.\n\n[1]\tWeng, Y., \u201cLarge Language Models are Better Reasoners with Self-Verification\u201d, <i>arXiv e-prints</i>, 2022. doi:10.48550/arXiv.2212.09561.\n[2]\tLuyu Gao and Aman Madaan and Shuyan Zhou and Uri Alon and Pengfei Liu and Yiming Yang and Jamie Callan and Graham Neubig (2022)PAL: Program-aided Language Models International Conference on Machine Learning abs/2211.10435\n[3]\tAman Madaan and Niket Tandon and Prakhar Gupta and Skyler Hallinan and Luyu Gao and Sarah Wiegreffe and Uri Alon and Nouha Dziri and Shrimai Prabhumoye and Yiming Yang and S.

Is there a specific scientific basis for this choice?\n3. Would it be possible to design ablation studies to elucidate why the \u201cEnsembling\u201d method performs better?

In other words, I do not really see the essential of defining a so-called \"backward reasoning\".\n\n- I have non-trivial concerns about the novelty and contribution of this paper. The \"rephrase\" techniques of the three proposed solutions that use x to replace the missing condition are not novel, which is already proposed in the advanced chain-of-thoughts methods [1]. Also, I do not see the uniqueness of the proposed ``PAL-Tools'', it is basically a special case of PAL [2]. Similar novelty concerns to the proposed ensemble stage as well, since the ensemble is definitely not a new technique and in most cases, it can improve the performance.\n\n- The ``backward reasoning'' problem and proposed approach are only evaluated on math benchmarks. However, if we target for uncovering a missing condition, it is essential to do evaluations on other types of reasoning tasks, such as commonsense and symbolic.\n\n\n[1] Fu et al, complexity-based prompting for multi-step reasoning.  \n[2] Gao et al.
