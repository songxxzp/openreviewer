However, the dynamics of fixed orthogonal classifiers concerning neural collapse, where last-layer features converge to a specific form called simplex ETF during training, have not been deeply explored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the concept of zero-mean neural collapse in non-negative Euclidean space. The authors propose a fixed non-negative orthogonal classifier that optimally induces this collapse, maximizing the margin of an orthogonal layer-peeled model. This classifier also offers advantages in continual learning and imbalanced learning by separating the last-layer feature dimensions. The paper provides comprehensive experiments to validate its claims, demonstrating significant performance improvements."

The paper should clarify whether its importance is solely due to the optimality shown in the LPM model or if there are additional factors which are outside the proof. The rationale behind constraining the representation space to the positive hyper-octant warrants further explanation.\n\nThe nature of the problem posed by the LPM model is not shown. The manuscript should specify whether it is linear, non-linear, or solvable by known matrix factorization techniques. Moreover, the discussion on the complexity of providing values for W is insufficiently developed, leaving the reader questioning where the complexity of the problem truly lies.\n\nCould the authors provide insight into why LPM optimality does not manifest in the case of a regular fixed d-simplex, and conversely, why it appears to be present in the context of Zero-mean Neural Collapse (ZNC)?\n\nThe visual clarity and structural coherence of Figure 1 could be enhanced to better convey the intended information.\n\nThe tables detailing experimental results should more clearly differentiate the methodologies used, to avoid confusion. The complex nomenclature, such as FNODERMR++, could be simplified for better clarity.\n\nIn Remark 1 at the end of section 5, the statement regarding the inability of a fixed orthogonal classifier to address neural collapse needs further clarification.
