                "value": "This paper presents a new algorithm for the task of AI-generated text detection. AI-generated text detection is a binary classification task of determining whether a given text was written by a human or a language model (like ChatGPT).\n\nThe key idea in this work is that the style of AI-generated text is different from human-written text, and this difference can be captured by a style representation model. First, the authors use a contrastive learning objective to learn style-dependent, but topic-independent representations. The authors leverage outputs from several cheap and readily available LMs (like GPT-2) to train the style representation model.\n\nDuring inference, the authors assume access to a few exemplar samples of AI-generated text from each held-out language model that they consider. Given a candidate query, the authors measure the cosine similarity between the style representation of the query and the style representation of the exemplars. The authors then use a threshold on the similarity score to classify the query as AI-generated or human-written.\n\nThe authors test their approach on ChatGPT / GPT4 / LLAMA-2 generated responses to prompts from Reddit. Using 5-10 exemplars, the authors find their approach to be quite effective at: 1) detecting whether a text was generated by a particular LM; 2) whether the text was generated by any of the held-out LLMs vs human-written."

Given the growing risk of plagiarism in college essays and the spread of misinformation using large language models, the topic of the paper is timely and very important.\n\n2. The proposed algorithm in the paper is interesting and based on an intuitive idea: LLM generated text has a different style from human-written text. The authors use an interesting contrastive learning objective to learn a strong style classifier, taking care to ensure the representations are topic-agnostic.\n\n3. The authors use a nice variant of AUC to stress test their algorithm: restricting the AUC range to 0-1%. This is a good metric to evaluate AI-generated text detection algorithms, since the desired false-positive rate is likely to be very low in real-world scenarios.\n\n4. The authors present several various different experimental setups of their few-shot classifier (each of which have practical significance). For instance, the authors study both a) detecting text written by a particular LLM; and b) detecting text written by any LLM. The authors also conduct ablation studies on variants of the style classifier."

Without these comparisons, it is hard to ground the proposed method in existing literature, and understand how it competes with alternatives. I recommend the authors to measure the performance of at least watermarks [1] and DetectGPT [2] on the Reddit datasets considered in this work.\n\n2. *No experiments measuring robustness to paraphrasing attacks*: It is now well-established that AI-generated text detectors are very brittle against paraphrasing attacks [4, 5], including DetectGPT, watermarks and GPTZero. How robust is the proposed few-shot style classifier against paraphrasing attacks like DIPPER [4, 5]? Given the vulnerability to paraphrasing, it is critical to evaluate AI-generated detectors on this dimension. Moreover, prior work [6] has shown that paraphrasing strips out stylistic elements from text. This might make the proposed approach even more vulnerable to paraphrasing attacks.\n\n3. Minor, but the writing of Section 3 and 4 was confusing (please see the questions below).\n\n[1] - https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10226  \n[2] - https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11305  \n[3] - https://gptzero.me  \n[4] - https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11156  \n[5] - https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13408  \n[6] - https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05700"

After reading the paper, I was a bit confused by the first sentence in Section 3.1, \"The experiments in this paper deal with both the supervised and few-shot learning regimes\". Where exactly were the experiments in the fully supervised regime? Please correct me if I'm wrong, but to the best of my understanding, the model was trained on data from \"Amply Available and Cheap\" LLMs (like GPT2), and then tested on harder LLMs (like ChatGPT) using few-shot style matching on this trained model.\n\n2. I was a bit confused in Section 3.2 on the procedure to build the style representation model. Was the UAR model used as the pretrained base model? Was the recipe inspired by Wegmann et al. (2022) used on top of the UAR model? or were these two different models? In which model was the AAC dataset used?\n\n3. Please mention that ChatGPT / GPT4 / LLAMA-2 were used to create the LWD data in the main body of the paper. This is a crucial experimental detail, and should not be in the Appendix."

Also, instead of introducing a new AUC' the authors could have resorted to something more in line with other works, E.g., something similar to FPR95 but reflecting the importance of a low false positive rate. Using the reasoning from section 4.3, a TPR95 (also not in the literature like AUC', but would be more in line with FPR95.). Missing details in the experiment section: Size of training and evaluation corpora, which LLMs are analyzed. It would help if the authors also mentioned that AUC' is normalized.\nSection 4.4: \nThe paper mentions that Reddit is the main training corpus and, therefore, not used for evaluation. This contradicts section 4.1, where Reddit is also in the evaluation corpus. So, how is Reddit used?\nTable 2 shows different methods trained on different training corpora. Since the paper emphasizes that UAR is THE method to perform few-shot LLM text detection, why are the baselines not trained on the same training corpora?\nWhat is the difference between Reddit (5M) and Reddit (used for SBERT) in Table 2\nWhy is Twitter from Table 2 not mentioned in Table 1?\nHow do the authors explain that the proposed UAR (based on SBERT) is still much better than SBERT? The authors emphasize that SBERT is unsuitable as it is trained to capture semantics. So why not use a \"normal\" BERT in UAR?\nRoBERTa (zero shot) is not introduced. What is it exactly?\nSection 4.5:\nThe text mentions \"other UAR variants.\" Are the Multi-LLM and Multi-domain models UAR variants? This should be clarified. Also, again, the same problem as in the other sections: why not train the other methods with this setup?\n\n\nAdditional remarks:\n-Section 4.5, first paragraph, last row: \"the number of posts\" should probably be \"the number of tokens\" or are the descriptions and axis titles wrong in Figure 2?"
