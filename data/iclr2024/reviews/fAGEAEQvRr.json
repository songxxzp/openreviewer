Different from existing works that only consider small initialization, this paper considers initializations that have constant scale. Under certain regularity assumptions on the initialization and singular values in the training process, the authors show that gradient descent still exhibits incremental learning. In their theoretical analysis, the auhtors use a  novel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) argument to show the exponential separation between a low-rank signal and a noise term, which allows that to show that gradient descent trajectory is nearly low-rank."

Can you explain this assumption in more details?\n\n2) The authors seem to employ a successive argument for general rank matrix. However, the definition of the benign set $R$ in Sec. 3.1 would change for higher ranks. Is there any arguments in your proof verifying that GD remains in the high-rank $R$? Probably you did it in Theorem 13, but I cannot understand how they are related.\n\n3) In existing works it is commonly the case that convergence/incremental learning hold with high probability (e.g.[1] Theorem 3.3), since the initialization has to be aligned with each component, otherwise it cannot make progess in some direction. Does this paper need to impose similar requirements for initialization?\n\n[1] Stoger, D. and Soltanolkotabi, M.

                "value": "### Mathematics\nBy order of importance:\n- The paper claims to study large initialization, and that the first result with initialization in the region of Eq 10 is not satisfying. However, the proof of the main result states \"This is achievable if we use random initialization X0 = \u03b1N0 with a reasonably small constant \u03b1\", which is not \"large initialization\". $\\alpha$ must be small enough such that $\\sigma^2_1(K_r) \\leq \\lambda_r - 3 \\Delta/4$, so $\\alpha$ depends on $r$, and it's not so wild to think that $r$ is a fraction of $d$. Remark 4 seems to contradict that, highlighting that the theorem does not require $X_0 \\in S$, but the exposition is very confusing here (eg, Lemma 5 assumes that $X_0 \\in S$)\n- It is clear that Sigma can be assumed diagonal in problem 1 up to an orthogonal change of variable in $X$ (because GD is equivariant to such a change of variable), but this deserves to be stated explicitly the first time this assumption is made (P2).\n- $\\sigma_1(u_{k,t})$ is just its norm, right? $u_{k,t}$ is a vector. Same for $u_{k,t} K_{k, t}^\\top$\n\n\n## Experiments\n- In the experimental example, how do we know if 0.5 N(0, 1/d) is a large initialization? Since $d$ does not vary, what can we say? It would be better to have the experiment for several values of $d$ and fixed $\\bar \\omega$\n- The experimental example considers rank 2 matrix factorization which, though by nature different as the authors have explained, does not seem to far from rank 1 factorization (especially compared to the dimension 2000). It would highlight the goal of the paper better to use something like rank 10 matrix factorization here.\n- Please provide more than one experiment in dimension 2. The analysis is incomplete without more proof that the results hold for varying r and d, fixed $\\bar \\omega$.\n\n\n\n### Formulation\n- Incremental learning has many possible meanings, it would be nice to clarify it here. Same for \"spectral method\", I think the amount of details given in section 3.2 should be slightly increased.\n- P3 \"because at the global minima\"/\"the set R contains all the global minima\": it seems to me that there is a single global minima, the rank-$r$ truncated SVD of $\\Sigma$. can the authors clarify?\n- First sentence of Section 3.3 is a repetition from above.\n- Paragraph 4.1 consider replacing rank-$r$ by rank-2 for clarity (and all instances of $r$ in that paragraph)\n- Legend of Figure 1: \"top three rows\" are the first three rows?\n\n### References:\n- I believe the paper is missing the seminal reference \"S. Gunasekar, B. E. Woodworth, S. Bhojanapalli, B. Neyshabur, and N. Srebro, \u201cImplicit regularization\nin matrix factorization,\u201d in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017\" which conjectured global convergence of GD to the minimal nuclear norm solution in the case of small initialization.\n\n\nTypos:\n- takes infinity at 0\n- the rest elements: the remaining elements/the rest of the elements (several occurrences)"

Is this assumption necessary, or is it presented for the diagonal case wlog? What is the key difficulty in generalizing it to non-diagonal matrices?\n\n**Minor points**\n- Please define incremental to avoid confusion with the alternative use of incremental learning as a synonym for seeing-one-example-at-a-time learning. I realise in post that this is what the second-to-last paragraph in \u00a71 is doing, but I didn't read it as such. A more explicit phrasing the first time the term appears might help, eg in the 4th paragraph \"Jin et al. demonstrate an increamental learning phenomenon with small initialization; Eigenvectors associated with large eigenvalues are learned first\". A sentence as to how this differs qualitatively from a similar observation on linear regression might help contextualize too.\n- The introduction describes matrix factorization as \"mirroring the training of a two-layer linear network\", but this doesn't hold for the symmetric matrix factorization studied here, which seems more similar to quadratic regression\n- The term \"period\" on page 7 might be replaced by \"time\", as the behavior is not periodic\n- \"ascend to infinity\" is more commonly referred to as \"diverge\" or \"diverge to infinity\"."
