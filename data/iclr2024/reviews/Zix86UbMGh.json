The dataset supports the following tasks: (1) input: formal theorem statement, output: formal proof; (2) input: informal statement, output: informal proof; (3) input: informal (formal) statement, output formal (informal) statement; (4) input: informal statement, output: formal proof. \n\nThe authors also train and open-source ProofGPT (1.3B and 6.7B models) trained on proof-pile \u2013 8.3B tokens of mathematical text (authors promise to open-source). \n\nThe authors run baselines (using ProofGPT with two sizes as well as code-davinci-002), including few-shot baselines. The authors also attempt two other approaches: prompt retrieval and distilled backtranslation. Informalization (formal statement converting to informal statement) accuracy is higher than formalization. Although the datasets can support many tasks (mentioned above), most discussion in this paper is on autoformalization (informal -> formal) and informalization (formal -> informal)."
