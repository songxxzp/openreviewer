Unlike PINN\u2019s point-to-point processing, the proposed method produces multiple outputs in a forward pass by injecting multiple input coordinates. The authors used a \u2018pseudo-sequence generator\u2019, which constructs a sequence of input coordinates consisting of a spatial coordinate and multiple time coordinates. The following transformer module models the dependency between input coordinates to generate the final outputs. They also introduce wavelet activation function that shows the effectiveness. The authors have tested on three different PDEs, and it shows the comparative performance."

                "value": "1. I respectfully disagree with the author\u2019s argument that the original PINN neglects temporal dependency. PINN takes temporal coordinates and spatial coordinates together and generates the output. By going through multiple layers in MLP, the time coordinate will definitely affect the features from the spatial coordinates. I agree that the suggested method might be able to model time dependency more explicitly. However, the argument that the original PINN is not capable of modeling time dependency is too strong.\n\n2. As a follow-up comment, we sample many random collocation points at each iteration, and MLP can see many time coordinates with spatial coordinates during training. Hence, I believe the original PINN is capable of modeling time dependency.\n\n3. Is delta t fixed? if yes, then it might be a not trivial limitation, considering different time granularity at different time coordinates.\n\n4. If I understand correctly, it seems that Spatio-Temporal Mixer is just one layer MLP. I might have missed something, but the technical details are not properly described in explaining each component. The formal definition of each module would be appreciated.\n\n5. The proposed Wavelet activation function seems to be a simplified version of the positional encoding. In addition, IMHO, the sine activation function, followed by MLP, which attaches weights to each neuron, could do the same thing. cos function can also be easily expressed by a bias term from the previous layer e.g., sin(x) = cos(90-x).\n\n6. My main concern is a weak experimental setup and results. The authors presented the results of simple three PDEs, which already have been tackled by numerous works. And, there are many previous works that achieved better results (lower relative errors) [1]. \nThe authors highlighted \u2018very low loss\u2019 values. Loss depends on loss function and hyperparameters, which cannot be a fair metric.\nThe Navier-stokes experiment used in this paper is too simple.

Conducting detailed empirical studies to evaluate Wavelet against various state-of-the-art activations under different settings can provide better insights into its benefits and limitations. This is important to fully understand its behavior and assess its effectiveness.\n\nThe paper only considers isotropic problems which have constant properties in all directions. However, most real-world physics systems exhibit anisotropic and nonlinear characteristics. Extending PINNsFormer to handle anisotropic problems modeled by direction-dependent PDEs, as well as nonlinear problems involving variable coefficients, would significantly broaden its applicability and demonstrate the approach's versatility. \n\nNo quantitative analysis was performed to evaluate important design choices like the pseudo sequence length and number of levels in coarsening. Without such ablation studies, it is difficult to justify critical hyperparameters and understand their impact on the model's performance as well as computational efficiency. These quantitative studies would provide further insights to validate the architectural design of PINNsFormer.\n\nAlthough various benchmark problems were tested, stronger validation would involve demonstrating the approach's effectiveness in entirely new physical domains beyond the existing test cases. Without such generalization to unseen problem classes, the claims regarding PINNsFormer's broad applicability remain partially unsubstantiated.\n\nWhile efficient on smaller problems, the inherent quadratic complexity of self-attention may pose scalability challenges for extremely large spatiotemporal datasets. Developing techniques to alleviate this computational limitation would enhance the method's practicality when dealing with massive real-world physics simulations."

On the other hand, the use of discrete pseudo-sequences means temporal dependencies are modeled in the fashion of finite difference approximations rather than pure automatic differentiation. Would it create any difficulties in picking parameters for this differentiation (e.g., the \u0394t)? \n\nA relevant thought: The impact of the timestep granularity \u0394t seems worth further analysis. Is there a study on model sensitivity to this parameter? Does the performance degrade if \u0394t is too small or large? Are there any guidelines for setting \u0394t?\n\n2. It may be worth trying the causal-attention transformers (decoder-based, e.g. LLM) instead of the encoder-decoder architecture. It does not seem to have particular reasons to adopt current sequence-to-sequence architecture.\n\n3. Other sampling schemes may also play an important role [1], especially for mitigating the temporal propagation failure in PINNs. Since PINNFormer relies on discretization on temporal dimensions, I am curious how PINNFormer can adapt to non-fixed sampling. I believe the transformer architectures have such flexibility.\n\n[1] Daw, Arka & Bu, Jie & Wang, Sifan & Perdikaris, Paris & Karpatne, Anuj. (2022).
