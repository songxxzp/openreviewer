                "value": "This paper investigates the WiSE-FT method's ability to enhance OOD performance in machine learning and identifies a notable \"FalseFalseTrue\" phenomenon that shows WiSE-FT correcting both individual model errors. Motivated by this, the authors conduct theoretical analysis in a multi-class setting. The theoretical results suggest that using diverse spurious features in ensemble methods improves OOD generalization, contradicting the traditional emphasis on invariant features. This theory is validated with experiments on the MultiColorMNIST dataset. Meanwhile, the authors also identify a weakness of WiSE-FT due to its overconfidence in fine-tuned models under OOD data. Based on that, the authors proposed a new method BANG that addresses the overconfidence problem and reaches better OOD performance."

The paper considers the setting of ensembling two individual models (FalseFalseTrue) and show that such ensemble indeed improves over single model's OOD performance on MultiColorMNIST. Is this finding generalizable to ensembles of more than two models? If we increase the number of models in Table 1, could the ensemble's performance potentially see further improvement?\n2. For datasets that specifically focus on spurious correlations (Waterbirds), there will be only one strong spurious feature (background) in the training data. In such a case, will the ensemble method still be effective? If not, could we manually adding new spurious features to the training data (color, rotation, scale, ect.) and apply ensemble methods like BANG to improve the model's performance?"

                "value": "The paper examines WiSE-FT to understand how ensemble based models improve OOD performance. First, a \u201cFalseFalseTrue\u201d phenomenon is observed, where the ensembled model predicts samples correctly even when both the pretrained and finetuned model that are ensembled predict the samples incorrectly. The paper suggests an explanation for this related to ensembled models making use of diverse sparse features, and this reducing the influence of any given sparse feature below that of invariant features. This is then shown to be the case theoretically, and on a synthetic empirical setting. Finally, the paper makes the related observation that successful ensembling requires balanced models (so that the ensembled model benefts from diverse sparse features). This motivates a recommendation to finetune models with mixup and label smoothing to decrease confidence, and the resulting ensemble model is called BANG. BANG shows empirical performance stronger than that of WiSE-FT."

While appendix E.6 shows that there are \u201coracle weights\u201d to scale standard finetuned models when ensembling, it may not be that BANG models are bringing improvements for the same reason.\n\nOne way to demonstrate this would be analysis similar to \u201caccuracy on the line\u201d where there are models finetuned with mixup and LS at the same OOD accuracy as standard finetuned models. It would strengthen the claims of Section 4 if the BANG models in this setting outperform WiSE-FT even with finetuned models at the same OOD performance."

Is there intuition for what BANG is doing in the in-distribution setting that explains this?\n\n* It would be good to see \u201cFalseFalseTrue\u201d analysis (like figure 2 left) of BANG models compared to WiSE-FT models. It appears from appendix E.6 that BANG models may be helpful in a \u201cTrueFalseTrue\u201d setting where the finetuned model was originally incorrect and overconfident. Does calibration help in the FalseFalseTrue setting?"

This is not reflected in the paper except loosely when they say low overlap is good weight space ensembles. The authors acknowledge this even when they talk about their method \"However, this method can not be directly applied to WiSE-FT since WiSE-FT ensemble model weights instead of the outputs.\"\n\nThe paper does focus a lot of output ensembling, which is not known to work as well as WiSE-FT. In that case, there is no discussion of boosting, which seems to have the same flavor (especially when forcing models to rely on different features).\n\n\nIt is also unclear that Mix-up and label-smoothing have singular effects on the confidence, they also regularize. So BANG is really just finetuning with MIXup/LS and then doing WiSE-FT. A more direct correction of confidence would be the right one, like doing temperature scaling for each checkpoint during finetuning and then running WiSE-FT"
