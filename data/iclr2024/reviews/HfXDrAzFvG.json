While the authors\nstate that such activations are becoming popular for the design of Lipschitz\nneural networks, no concrete examples are provided. I am also concerned about\nthe following:\n\n- The basic idea of LipSDP was developed by Fazlyab et al. (2019) while the \n    extension to estimation in the $\\ell_\\infty$ norm is from Wang et al. (2022).\n    The main theoretical contribution of this work is to develop new quadratic\n    constraints which fit into those frameworks, rather than build significantly\n    on top of them. Thus, the paper may be somewhat incremental in nature.\n\n- The authors do not provide the computation time for the naive baseline method\n    for approximating Lipschitz constants based on operator norms (MP),\n    so it is not clear what the trade-off between computation and accuracy is\n    for the proposed method.\n\nI am hesitant to recommend this submission for acceptance without additional \nevidence that the Householder and GroupSort activations are of practical\ninterest for Lipschitz estimation (see \"Questions\").\nMoreover, this paper is outside of my research area so it is difficult for me\nto judge its theoretical novelty; I did not check the proofs for correctness\nfor the same reason.

Since\nthese activations are the exclusive focus of the paper, I feel there must be an\nimmediate desire from the community to solve this problem in practice for\nthe paper to have a significant impact.\n\nI would also appreciate it if the authors could provide running times for the\nnaive estimation strategies in Table 1; this well help contextualize the cost\nof LipSDP-NSR and clarify the trade-off between accuracy and compute time. \n\nFinally, perhaps the authors can comment on the difficulty of deriving\nthe quadratic constraints for the SDPs.
