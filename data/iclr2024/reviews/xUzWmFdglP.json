                "value": "Given a set of workload queries, the matrix mechanism identifies a set of basis vectors, adds noise to these basis vectors, and then computes DP answers to workload queries via linear combinations of the perturbed basis vectors. This unique algorithm structure poses a challenge to quantifying the privacy amplification by subsampling in matrix mechanism -- each subsampled sensitive data is possibly reused multiple times in computing different basis vectors (in which case the final noise added to each query is correlated). Due to the lack of such privacy amplification results in prior works, the DP-FTRL algorithm (which uses matrix mechanism as a crucial component) in general does not exhibit better performance than the DP-SGD algorithm. \n\n- In this paper, the authors prove novel bounds for privacy amplification by subsampling for matrix mechanism. The proof decomposes the output distribution into the composition of multiple mixtures of Gaussian mechanisms, where each mixture component is the conditional distribution of the next basis vector given the participation histories of sensitive data and noisy observations in prior rounds.     \n- By using this analysis, the authors improve the existing unamplified privacy guarantee for the binary-tree-FTRL algorithm under shuffling by a multiplicative factor of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log(n)})$ where $n$ is the size of the dataset. This improvement is supported by numerical experiments. \n- Finally, the authors show that this improved privacy analysis enables performance gain for the DP binary-tree-FTRL algorithm under small $\\varepsilon$ under the CIFAR-10 dataset centralized setup."
