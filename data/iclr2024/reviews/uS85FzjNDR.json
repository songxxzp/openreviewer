                "value": "1. The proposal seems to be a direct combination of existing technologies. The novelty of this proposal seems limited, and I am concerned that it may not bring new insights to the SSL community. The effectiveness of these techniques, such as using weighted moving averaging to reduce noise in pseudo-label updates, contrastive learning to strengthen prototype representation learning, and mixup to mitigate domain gaps, has been widely validated in the SSL/UDA community. It is foreseeable that combining them can improve the performance of SSL in a heterogeneous setting. However, the current version of the paper does not provide further analysis to explain or evaluate their effectiveness/reliability. More in-depth analysis, especially regarding their roles in heterogeneous SSL, can further improve this paper. For example, different technologies could be employed to handle noisy pseudo labels, such as ensemble, confidence-based selection, and entropy-based selection. Why did the current framework choose EMA, and what special capabilities does it have for heterogeneous SSL?\n2. I also suggest that the author focus more on the issues in heterogeneous SSL rather than presenting the proposal from a technical perspective. From my understanding, in this article, the author uses three techniques to handle noisy pseudo labels and the misalignment of representation learning when facing cross-domain data. Defining the key problems in heterogeneous SSL may have a more positive impact on the community. For example, what difficulties do existing SSL techniques encounter due to the domain gap? Furthermore, the proposed Uni-HSSL achieves better heterogeneous SSL by addressing these problems separately.\n3. In the experiment, the author only compared some previous baseline algorithms, and the SOTA method is missing. As mentioned by the author in the text, the ICML23 work considered the same problem, and it should be included in the comparison process of the experiment."
