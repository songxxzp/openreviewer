The contributions include the adaptation of discrete diffusion for semantic segmentation to model uncertainty and the introduction of an auto-regressive diffusion framework for future forecasting.

Where does the method perform well, where does it show weaknesses, does it learn something about the movement of other entities in the scene, where does the performance improvement from 1 to 100 samples evaluation come from? \\\nThe work shows in the car simulator dataset that the method does generate a variety of future scenarios, however it is not shown for the more complex Cityscapes dataset. Showing it quantitatively is of course difficult with the existing data, however it is also not clearly shown qualitatively. \\\nFor scenarios like the mentioned \"Is there a scenario in which the child crosses the road?\" to be applicable real-time performance is essential.

In other words, given an image, how can I distinguish the two categories of \"the rectangles have different classes\"? Secondly, what are the two categories the deterministic model predicts? \\\n[1] was made public earlier this year. Can you please elaborate on the differences to the work at hand? \\\nChen et al. (2022a) (referenced by you) was made public last year. While they do not show results regarding handling ambiguity, at first glance it seems to be applicable. Does the approach at hand have specific properties that would make it more advantageous for this task compared to their approach? \\\nFor clarification, in 4.2.2: For each car in each validation example 10 samples are generated. The best of the 10 samples is selected according to FDE. 84% of those FDE values are less then 2 (a \"hit\"). And then the mean of the best FDE values (hit and miss) is computed. Is this correct? I am not sure the mean is very informative then as the distribution seems to be quite skewed.\n \nGeneral Notes \n\nThere seems to be quite a bit of interesting information in the supplement that is never referenced in the main paper, e.g., the MO results for Cityscapes, making it difficult for the reader to be aware of it. \\\nIn Sec 3.1/2 it is not always fully clear to me what parts are from Austin et al. and what parts are adaptations by the authors.\n\nMost issues have been addressed satisfactorily in the Discussion Phase, thus I've updated my rating from 5 to 6."
