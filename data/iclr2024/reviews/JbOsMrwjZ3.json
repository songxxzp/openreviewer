I would expect that in the second part of the abstract (after you motivated the problem of difficulty of correctly generating code for domain specific areas such as bioinformatics) you provide some evidence on why your dataset is either: (a) useful to help train models that achieve better performance for the given domain or (b) it provides a good measure to estimate whether an LLM is effective for the code generation in the field of bioinformatics (or specific subarea of bioinformatics coding domains).\n\n- Abstract. Sentence \"In relation to function-code generation ...\" is unclear given the previous sentences. Reformulate.\n\n- Abstract. Sentence \"It incorporates 1026 functions and 1243 methods in Python and Java from GitHub\". You probably need to add \"respectively\" after the word \"Java\".\n\n- Introduction. I would like to see some discussion or evidence of why the dataset you constructed is an effective dataset for the field of bioinformatics. Some of the questions that are still left in my mind are:\n    - What is the range of problems/areas bioinformatics code typically encompasses? \n    - What position/importance in the field of bioinformatics is occupied by the tasks you include in your dataset? I see some information in the appendix, but ultimately this is a crucial factor in the paper, so there needs to be a good evidence about it in the main paper.\n    - Ultimately, what is the value that a bioinformatics programmer, who wants to use an LLM to help writing his/her code, will gain by evaluating LLMs on your dataset? Can he/she gain some level of confidence that LLM that works well on your dataset, will perform better on his/her problems?\n    \n- Introduction. You mention that you create \"a new high-quality dataset\". It may be a high-quality dataset, but it would be good to add some specific numbers or evidence on why it is so.\n\n- It would be great if in Figure 2 (describing the overall process of constructing the dataset) you indicate which parts of the process are done manually, and which part is automated.\n\n- Related Work. \"We ensure each function demands a certain level of domain expertise in bioinformatics\". Can you add briefly how? It can be as simple as \"via manual inspection\". But, later on you need to elaborate further how the manual inspection was performed to ensure that.\n\n- \"golden code file\". While one can guess what the meaning of the golden code file is, it would be good to explain. This phrase is used only at a single place in the paper.\n\n- \"Summary Only prompts\". When encountering this phrase in the paper for the first time, it's not obvious what this means. One can look at Figure 3 and infer, but it would be good to have a natural flow in the main body of the paper itself.\n    - If your concern is space, I would rather remove results of certain prompt types from the main paper, and put them into the appendix. Then, for a single version of the prompt I would explain in detail in the main paper how it is constructed.\n    - Also, Figure 3 is not elaborated inside of the paper.\n\n- Table 4. \"Results are in %\". I would write something like: results are expressed in percentage.\n\n- I would add line numbers for the review purposes so reviewers can easily refer to a given part of the paper in their comments.\n\n- Table 1. Spell out the abbreviations somewhere for P.C., P.L., C.C., C.L.\n\n- Table 6. I would suggest using percentage instead of raw numbers for showing distribution of test error types. You can also include information about total number of test cases vs number of failed cases. You could possibly restructure the table to remove repetitive \"Failure Reason\"."

However, there are several concerns regarding the methodology and evaluation of this paper, which I will elaborate on below:\n\n\n1. My biggest concern is the lack of justifications for the testing framework for Python and Java functions in BioCoder. The authors state, \"... we employ a custom syntax to indicate the insertion points for custom randomly generated test cases.\" How are the test cases \"randomly generated\" and inserted into the context files? I did not find any detailed explanations in the main paper or in Appendix L and Y. In particular, Appendix L only briefly introduces the pipeline of the testing framework, how does such an approach deliver \"a secure and efficient testing framework, promising robustness in the evaluation of generated code\"? The authors need to clarify more about the generation of the test cases.\n\n2. In addition to the previous point, for Rosalind functions, the authors mentioned, \"...the output of this execution is compared with the cached golden code output.\" Why and how are the generated codes compared with the gold code outputs? I do not find any experiment results that illustrate the comparison outcomes.\n\n3. Another concern is the implementation of correction mechanisms which rectify minor syntax and style errors. What kind of syntax and style errors can be considered \"minor\" with no impact on the functionality of the generated programs? As the authors take invalid syntax and runtime error as two major failure reasons in the following error distribution analysis, I recommend further justifying such correction mechanisms, which may affect the validity of the analysis results.\n\n4. Table 4 summarizes the performance of the studied LLMs on BioCoder w.r.t 4 different types of prompt formats. However, the explanations of the different prompt versions are placed in Appendix I, which makes Table 4 hard to understand. Moreover, Appendix I only gives explanations with examples of the prompts in each version; nevertheless, I am looking for some high-level guidelines for the prompt design. Namely, how the five prompt versions are proposed? Are they from existing lectures or experimental experience? What are the characteristics of different prompt formats?\n\n5. The discussion of the experiment results seems shallow to me. In section 5, the authors consider there is an inverse relationship between the length of the input prompts and the performance of the generated codes. However, from Table 4 and Appendix I, the Necessary only prompts have relatively shorter prompts but lower passing rates compared to uncommented and Summary at Top/Bottom in most of the studied LLMs. The author may elaborate more on the perspectives of prompt structures and contents instead of just the length of the prompts.\n\n\nMinor Comments\n\n1. The \"Summary At Bottom\" results illustrated in Appendix U seem incomplete (no row for GPT-4). \n\n2. From section 3.4, \"Our testing framework starts with a manual review of selected functions, leading to the creation of a context file and a golden code file for each problem (see Figure 3)\". I do not find how Figure 3 is correlated with the testing framework, Figure 17 in Appendix R may be a better example."
