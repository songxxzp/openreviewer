Second, for a multi-layer network without bias and a continuous, differentiable, and non-polynomial activation function, if the training data points are pairwise non-proportional, then the NTK is positive definite."

However, to analyze the convergence rate of over-parameterized neural networks, we need an explicit bound on the minimum eigenvalue in terms of the network parameters. Therefore, by combining the results with convergence theory, we can only deduce that gradient descent on those neural networks will minimize the training loss to zero. However, we still do not know the training costs. Second, in recent years, many works have pointed out the limitations of NTK and infinite-width neural networks. To apply the NTK theory, we may assume that the width should be $m=\\Omega(n^4)$, which is too impractical. Therefore, this paper may only have a limited broader impact on the deep learning theory community."

                "value": "The paper is dedicated to sufficient conditions for the positive definiteness of NTK. It is proved that the architecture with a bias term and a non-polynomial activation function automatically leads to positive-definite NTK. The proof is based on Theorem 3, which states that functions sigma(a[i]x+b[i]y), i=1,...,n are linearly independent if [a[i],b[i]] is not a multiple of [a[j],b[j]] for all i,j and sigma is not polynomial. An easy proof of Theorem 3 is given for the case when sigma is many times differentiable. In the appendix, a more elaborate proof is given for a general case. To avoid differentiability finite differences are analyzed instead. Then a case of an architecture with only one hidden layer becomes quite straightforward. A general case is treated in Proposition 1, in which it is proved that positive definiteness of NTK for lower layers inductively guarantees positive definiteness of NTK for the next layer. \n\nMajor claims seem correct, proofs are convincing. The paper is purely theoretical. A major weakness is a lack of deeper discussions about what these results give us for a better understanding of NNs.\n\nMinor correction on page 1: as emerged -> has emerged"

If two data samples are the same, then the NTK is not positive definite. I think the authors missed the condition that data samples are different.\n\n3. I don't understand the point of section 2.1. It spends two pages explaining the results that do not satisfy the condition of Theorem 1 ( the activation function is assumed to be $C^{N-1}$ in this section). Besides, the paragraph is repeated at the end of page 5.\n\n4. In the proof of Theorem 4, it says ''with the $z_i$ pairwise distinct and $\\beta \\neq 0$, in the view of Theorem 3...\". However, Theorem 3 requires totally non-aligned where being pairwise distinct is not sufficient. \n\n5. I don't think whether there is a bias or not is an important thing. With bias, x can be viewed as $[x,1]$.
