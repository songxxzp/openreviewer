The field has seen a significant shift towards self-supervised learning approaches, as evidenced by recent papers such as SNUG (Santesteban et al., CVPR 2022), HOOD (Grigorev et al., CVPR 2023), and DrapeNet (De Luigi et al., CVPR 2023). These works have moved away from traditional supervised learning methods, which stands in contrast to the claim made in Section 2 of the paper that \u201cMost recent approaches for neural garment deformations rely on supervised learning\u201d. This discrepancy raises questions about the paper's alignment with current trends and best practices in the field.\n\nThe paper introduces a dataset for training and testing deep learning models, but there are concerns regarding its generalizability. The dataset includes a limited number of collider objects (100), which may not be sufficient for ensuring that models trained on this data can generalize well to unseen geometries, as indicated by the results in Table 3. Additionally, the dataset and task are focused solely on static clothes subjected to gravity and resting on collider objects. This narrow scope may limit the utility of the dataset, as it does not reflect the dynamic nature of cloth in real-world scenarios.\n\nThe technical contributions of the paper appear to be modest. The proposed network architecture, consisting of a PointNet encoder and Neural Subdivision decoder, is relatively simple. Furthermore, the dataset is generated using a direct application of the PCS simulator, and the \u201cnew metrics\u201d mentioned in the abstract are standard measures such as Euclidean distance and curvature. The use of different curvature computations as metrics for assessing mesh similarity is not clearly justified or explained, leaving the reader uncertain about the soundness and efficacy of these measures.\n\n\nA minor point: the abstract seems too long."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- My major concern with the proposed dataset is the limited variety of cloth drape that is covered within it. It is true that the authors have put efforts into ensuring variation in factors such as different material types and collider objects, but it still spans a quite limited space of possible cloth drapes. For example, the dataset only includes cloth of square and round shapes, while in the real world, many interesting cloth examples do not belong to either of them, especially garments draped on human bodies which are of natural importance due to their applications. As another example, the final state of the draped cloth is significantly influenced by its initialization. For example, a cloth initialized as flat will be draped completely differently from being initialized evenly folded. Let alone all the infinite possibilities of manual interaction, for example in Fig. 1 (teaser) of the PCS paper (Zhang et al. 2022).\n\n- Due to the above limitation, I am concerned about the ability of this dataset to benchmark various upsampling algorithms under **complicated** deformation, let alone training machine learning models for complicated deformation. Notice that the perspective of judging a dataset is different from the algorithm that generates it. In the original PCS paper, even though relatively simple cloth shape and initialization have been demonstrated, it is less of a concern because as a physics-based algorithm, we generally have more confidence that it will work similarly for cloth of other shapes and from different initialization. In contrast, as a dataset intended for learning algorithms generated by this algorithm, its range of samples directly determines its scope of applicability because the common sense in machine learning is that a model cannot learn patterns outside its training distribution. In my own experience, the scenario where we are interested in a **square** cloth draped on an object without additional interaction is extremely rare.\n\n - Although PCS is by itself an excellent algorithm for multi-scale quasistatic cloth simulation, I am wondering to what extent it makes sense to use its output for the evaluation that is conducted in this experiment. On one hand, algorithms such as Loop subdivision or Neural Subdivision (Liu et al. 2020) were designed without physics in consideration at all. On the other hand, PCS is not without its own limitations. For example, the output in different levels still has some noticeable discrepancies, which is most obviously in the upper row of Fig. 9 where the paper cloth may or may not touch the ground depending on its resolution. I am wondering whether the authors have a good response for justification at a methodology level."

It may be good to avoid saying \"unnecessary\" because its tone may sound less respectful to the authors of the above work.\n- In Section E of the Supplementary document, it should be good to have a more detailed explanation of the quantities used as metrics and list the citations of their sources. The current form reads like plugging in the name of the term into the template of \"we compute [X] between the prediction and the ground truth\".\n- If I understand correctly, each level of upsampling in the dataset follows the midpoint subdivision as in Loop subdivision. Therefore, is it true that all the methods benchmarked in Table 1 should lead to the same topology? Is it possible to, or how can it be used for upsampling schemes that may not produce the same topologies? \n- In Sec. 6.2, it is made clear that the training/test split is performed across cloth material and collision objects. How is the split performed for experiments in Sec 6.1?\n- How does the proposed upsampling method compare with the original PCS method in terms of runtime performance etc.? It should be good to provide an analysis.\n\nI am willing to increase the rating if the above concerns are addressed in the rebuttal."

At high resolutions, moth physics based methods are prone to creating self-intersections while capturing details. How is this approach making sure that the ground truth is absolutely correct? The authors should comment on its reliability.\nWhy is collider object geometry only taken into account as point net features? Why are there no geometric losses to minimise the intersection between the collider object and the cloth? It could have helped better to improve the results. In most applications related to draping, the collider object is known. Using it directly by minimising the cloth-object interaction is widely popular.
