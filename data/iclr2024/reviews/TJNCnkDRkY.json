                "value": "The paper introduces a model called Generative Pre-Trained Speech Language Model (GPST) that addresses the challenges of modeling long acoustic sequences in neural audio codecs. Existing speech language models struggle to accurately represent acoustic tokens and often suffer from error propagation and information loss. GPST overcomes these limitations by employing a hierarchical transformer architecture and quantizing audio waveforms into two discrete speech representations. This allows for a unified one-stage generation process and improves the generation of high-resolution audio."

One of the main challenges of one-stage modeling is the increased GPU memory and time cost associated with the unified structure. Compared to two-stage models, the prior unified AR approach can result in a significant increase, up to 8 or even 16 times, in cost. To address this problem, the authors employ a relatively small Transformer model, where the top layers are not as large as the bottom layers. Then the memory and time cost are significantly reduced. \n\nThe authors employed a few of objective metrics to show the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Due to the absence of a perfect evaluation metric for speech generation tasks, it is necessary to conduct a subjective evaluation in the experiments. Additionally, it would be advantageous to provide a demo page for the reviewers to experience the quality of the pre-trained model firsthand. Even if the authors try their best to do objective evaluations, subjective evaluation is still required. DNSMOS is not enough to measure the speech quality. \n\n2. The primary focus of the paper is on efficiency; however, no specific metric is provided to evaluate its efficiency. I am curious about the potential inference time savings that can be achieved with the HIERARCHICALTRANSFORMER architecture.\n\n3. Given the existence of previous full NAR approaches like SoundStorm, the contribution of the paper seems relatively limited. The efficiency issue has already been largely addressed by these full NAR approaches. Consequently, I have doubts about whether the proposed HIERARCHICALTRANSFORMER structure will inspire further advancements in speech pre-trained models.\n\n4.The storytelling in the paper could be further enhanced. The primary contribution of the paper is the introduction of a unified stage speech pre-trained model, rather than the efficiency of the hierarchical transformer structure.

In particular, following the setup of SPEAR-TTS and AudioLM, speech is represented hierarchically as semantic tokens (clustered HuBERT/wav2vec2/w2v-BERT features) and acoustic tokens (SoundStream/Encodec tokens). A model first predicts semantic tokens and conditions on it to predict acoustic tokens.\n* As acoustic tokens are derived from residual vector quantizers, each time step is represented as a stack of tokens and hence speech is typically encoded at a rate of 600Hz to 1200Hz. Modeling such long sequences can be challenging for vanilla language models. Prior work considers multi-stage models that model semantic tokens, acoustic tokens sequentially with separate models, which the authors argue would result in error propagation.\n* The authors present a transformer to jointly model semantic tokens and audio tokens. In particular, MegaByte-style hierarchical Transformer is adopted for acoustic token modeling, where a global transformer processes sequence at 75Hz (taking the summed embedding over the stack of codes for a single time step) and the local transformer predicts the stack of codes within each time step auto-regressively.\n* The proposed model evaluated quantitatively on semantic token-to-audio generation, voice conversion, and acoustic continuation tasks. Qualitative results on unconditional speech generation are presented in the appendix."

The latter three are zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis models which take text and speaker prompt as input. In contrast, GPST and AudioLM take semantic tokens inferred from speech, which can have speaker information leaked from speech. If the authors follow the VALL-E setup for speaker identity transfer, then the semantic tokens are inferred from utterances from the same speaker as the audio prompt. For a more fair comparison, I would like to see the GPST-TTS setup for speaker identity transfer where semantic tokens are also inferred from text, in order to compare fairly with the zero-shot TTS models.\n2. There is no direct comparison between hierarchical and non-hierarchical (i.e., flatten the audio tokens and use vanilla LM) models that are trained with the same objective. The comparison with AudioLM is not sufficient as there are other confounding factors.\n3. Why are DNSMOS not presented in Semantic to Acoustic and Acoustic Continuation tasks?\n4.

For instance:  \u201c...which limits the performance of fine acoustic token generation..\u201c why this is true? did the authors study that? can the authors provide experiments/refs to support that? Or: \"These multi-stage generative models induce significant error propagation issues, which can negatively impact the overall performance.\u201c do the authors have experiments/refs to support that? Or: \"Additionally, obstructing the information flow among hierarchical quantizers would degrade the model\u2019s performance, especially in Hi-Res speech generation that requires more residual quantizers.\"\n3. Regarding the efficiency analysis, I\u2019m not sure I agree with the author's analysis. The size of $D$ is usually 4/8/12 not more than that, $m_l$ is probably much bigger. So in case the authors decide to ignore $m_l$ in their analysis, they should also ignore $D$. Overall, I agree with the authors that the proposed method is likely to be more efficient, I just do not agree with their specific analysis.\n4. Regarding the results, can the authors provide more details on how they compute the WER using the GSLM method? GSLM [1] is a decoder-only method that operates on units obtained from HuBERT. There is no conditioning on text. So it is not clear to me how the authors compute WER when the model performs continuation / unconditional generation. Can the authors provide more details here?\n5. Did the authors try to explore / compare their method to a simple delay pattern as introduce by [2, 3]? It will greatly simplify the modeling approach and remove the need to the local transformer. \n6.
