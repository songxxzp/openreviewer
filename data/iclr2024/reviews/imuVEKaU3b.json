                "value": "NOD, being a binary classifier, is very simple and easy to deploy. This simplicity is based on the following reasonings (verbatims of the original text in the paper):\n- outliers should be generally sparser distributed than inliers, \n- noises with uniform prior probability density have the maximum entropy, and thus essentially have little chance of resembling structured inputs, hence should have high probability of being outlier than most samples in the original (unlabelled) data, and\n- random noise can act as a trustworthy and stable reference for a sample's anomaly degree in the whole data space and demands few assumptions towards the inliers' distribution\n\nBased on the above observations, the authors propose to generate random noises and train the classifier to differentiate between original data samples and noises. My understanding here is this model will assign outliers in the original data higher anomaly score than inliers.\n\nNOD is corroborated by a couple of theoretical results.\n\nExperimental results look comprehensive and solid."

But then would this be an issue? Put differently, I don't follow how the binary classifier can distinguish original outliers from inliers given that both belong to the same class in training data.\n\nPropositions, lemmas and theorems are hard to follow. I suggest to have a table of notations used.\n\nThe proofs are also not that convincing. For instance, Lemma 1 sounds as if it's applicable to any type of noise. The proof in the Appendix needs specifically generated uniform noise. To fix this, please restate this Lemma (and others) to make clear what kind of inputs are required, e.g. noises generated in a specific way."
