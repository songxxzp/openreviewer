In contrast to most PbRL work, they do not assume the existence of state-action utility. \nThis algorithm forms the base for analyzing the algorithms sample complexity, using a novel trajectory-based concentration coefficient. This analysis is also applied to a setting with learned transition dynamics and action preferences."

This work is especially relevant, as it is not restricted to a specific class of function approximation and considers return-based utility. Reward-based utility is usually easier to handle, but can induce abnormalities in the preference setting, therefore the return-generalization is also highly interesting. Adapting the concentrability coefficient to this setting is interesting as it allows to separate (offline) optimization of the policy from the issues of exploration/exploitation."

E.g. the idea of return-based utility approximation is not novel (e.g. Preference-Based Policy Learning, Akrour, 2011 - see Wirth 2017 for more examples). This is relevant because of two reasons. First, it allows the reader to determine which algorithms fit under the proposed framework and second, it clarifies the differences between the proposed algorithm and other works. Considering the algorithm is mentioned as one of the main contributions, but likelihood-based estimation of the return utility is already known, the novelty of the algorithm is a bit limited.\n\nBesides that, there are several possibilities to improve the presentation:\n- Reward is defined wrt. trajectories, but this is commonly denoted return in the PbRL literature\n- Some relevant information is left to the appendix - mostly the feasible implementation and the comparison to Zu 2023. Especially some details concerning the feasible implementation are relevant for practioners.\n- Remark 3 is not explained\n\nFurthermore, to the reviewer, one of the statements is not obvious:\n- cannot be relaxed to the per-step concentrability without additional assumptions, such as on the reward structure - Why does it follow from the Theorems, that state-action rewards are not enabling this?\n\nAs small remarks:\n- Missing reference: \"..per-step concentrability coefficient Cst commonly used in the general offline RL literature\"\n- Missing reference: \"..It is well-known that when the reward is state-action-wise, the optimal policy \u03c0 is both Markovian and deterministic.\"\n- Definition 1 is a bit hard to understand, because g is never define.\n- The slack parameter in Sec. 4.1 has the wrong symbol\n- Typo in Alg 2: \"Distributionally robust plnanning\""

The second algorithm is similar to the first except that it operates under the assumptions that the transition probabilities are unknown. The algorithm estimates the transition probabilities using MLE and constructs uncertainty sets around the MLE of the transition probabilities. It then optimizes the policy against the worst reward model and the transition probabilities in their respective uncertainty sets. The third algorithm considers the case where preferences are established over actions instead of trajectories. It estimates the advantage function and computes a greedy policy based on the advantage function.\nWhile the paper does not empirically evaluate these algorithms, they theoretically analyze the sample complexity and performance error of the algorithms and show that as long as the offline data covers the target policy,  it can compete with the target policy.\nThey also show that even if the reward is trajectory wise, you can still efficiently learn the policy if the transition dynamics are estimated per step.\nFinally, the paper establishes a partial coverage guarantees for the third algorithm and show that the sample complexity scales with a bound on the advantage function."
