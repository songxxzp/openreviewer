For instance, the term \"grokking tickets\" is used 12 times before its formal definition presented, which presents a certain impediment to readers.\n\n2. I am uncertain about the practical significance of the findings. Specifically, I understand that one of the conclusions is that tickets found during the $C_{mem}$ phase exhibit better performance. However, this seems to align with the common practice in LTH research~\\cite{chen2021unified, gan2022playing}, where networks are thoroughly trained and then pruned based on optimal validation scores during each pruning iteration. Therefore, the question arises as to what contribution the findings in the paper make to the discovery of improved lottery tickets.\n\n3. The experimental results in Section 5.2 appear to support the author's claims that poor selection of subnetworks harms generalization. However, as mentioned in 2, the grokking tickets results seem to represent the outcomes of LTH approaches. It appears that the author has primarily validated that LTH with IMP can outperform most PaI methods. \n\n4. While the existing results do indeed support the author's assertions, the use of overly simplistic tasks (modular addition and MNIST classification), basic baselines (MLP and single-head Transformer), and a lack of additional experimental configurations (such as performance under multi-layer MLPs or multi-head attention) leave me with reservations regarding the validity of the conclusions."

The hypothesis examined here is that neural network training results in a sparse network. Sparsity may then be used to explain the reason behind delayed generalization. The paper conducts an empirical analysis with modular addition using a small Transformer  and briefly studies an MLP with large initialization as suggested by Liu et. al.  Ablations are conducted that show that the grokked solution checkpoint generalizes faster than checkpoints collected at earlier points during optimization."

It is known that regularization or lowering capacity of models via regularization does help shorten the time between fitting and generalization in algorithmic datasets. This observation falls in-line with the above\n- Given the empirical nature of the paper, the number of datasets considered in the analysis appear to be inadequate.

They trained a neural network to the grokking stage and then performed one-shot pruning. They called the subnetwork obtained as \u201cgrokking ticket\u201d. The authors observed that the grokking ticket can significantly shorten the training epochs needed to achieve the grokking stage, compared to the dense network.\n\nFurthermore, the authors conducted a series of ablation experiments to deconstruct the effects brought by the grokking tickets, including:\n* Pruning stage: tickets obtained before the grokking stage won\u2019t accelerate the occurrence of the grokking stage.\n* Weight norms: as the grokking phenomenon has been connected to the weight norms in the literature, the authors also compared the grokking tickets with dense networks whose weights are scaled to have similar norms. The results showed no acceleration through weight scaling.\n* Weight decay: the authors showed with numerical results that the grokking tickets at appropriate pruning ratios can waive the necessity of weight decay, which has been assumed necessary for grokking to happen."

The authors made interesting observations on the acceleration of grokking brought by pruning, which connects the seemingly disjoint topics.\n\n+ The authors provided results of well-designed experiments that decoupled grokking tickets and weight norms (thus weight decaying), which have been assumed to be the key of grokking, throwing light on a higher level of property that grokking could possess.\n\n+ Moreover, this work also provided a perspective of using grokking phenomenon to understand pruning and specifically lottery tickets. Many previous studies have shown that SNIP, GraSP and SynFlow achieved similar accuracies on classification tasks but Fig. 7 in this work showed very different behaviors with these methods."
