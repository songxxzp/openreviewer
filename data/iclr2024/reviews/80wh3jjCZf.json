First a continuous action is generated and discretized, then through simulated annealing with perturbation defined by other actions on the lattice with low hamming distance, a final proposed discrete action is obtained. This avoids the necessity of constructing extremely large nearest neighbor graphs, or solving a linear program on every forward pass. The convergence for the action selection process is proven, and the method is evaluated in two simulated domains with strong results over baselines."

I would prefer to have at least one more grounded and complex environment (perhaps a video game with many different possible actions, perhaps a multi-agent setting? I'm not the most familiar with the domains in this subfield).\n- Perhaps this is my unfamiliarity with the domain, but sometimes the text is quite hard to follow. I think part of this is the reliance on lots of acronyms (LDAS, SLDAS, MILP, SA), but also the claim in Section 2 \"we formulate the task of finding a Q-value maximizing a as a mixed-integer linear program\" was a bit confusing on first read, as really the authors are proposing an approximate solution, so saying this upfront might be a bit more clear.\n- Would be nice to see MILP results in Figure 5 against the proposed method and other baselines in Figure 3, and the discussion at the end of Appendix B is informative and it may be nice to have a note in the text"

The authors propose a technique that, similarly to other works, outputs a continuous action, which is then mapped to a valid discrete action that is executed in the environment. Their proposal applies for action spaces that are regularly structured (e.g., an equally-spaced grid), which allows the method to circumvent needing to store the valid actions in memory. Instead, to map to a discrete action, a simulated annealing search is proposed, that is shown (via reasonable assumption and a standard analysis technique) to yield actions that improve the (estimated) Q-value. The method is evaluated in environments with an exponential number of actions, showing similar performance with prior methods in regimes with less actions, and better performance in regimes with more actions."

                "value": "**W1**. My primary criticism is that the considered environments and scenarios where the technique applies are somewhat contrived. If one is faced with such a huge decision space, we would typically expect to spend the time in the modelling stage of the problem to design an action space that is substantially more manageable. For example, in the maze environment, we could design a discrete set of actions (move left, etc.), with the actual execution being handled by lower-level control primitives. Indeed, this needs to be performed for each individual problem (as the authors do mention).\n\n**W2**. I also have some concerns about the evaluation:\n\n- Firstly, for the maze environments, the variability of the techniques is such that the confidence intervals overlap substantially, and it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from these figures alone. Would this still happen with substantially more seeds (e.g. 50+)? Alternatively, would another procedure (e.g., running many episodes with randomly initialised positions) yield more reliable (i.e., with non-overlapping CIs)?\n- The simulated annealing search procedure must introduce a computational overhead compared to picking the best action greedily (e.g., as in DNC w/o SA). This is not mentioned, and the impact on runtimes is not analyzed or discussed. This needs to be addressed, accompanied by measurements."

                "value": "**C1**. The paper refers in several places to approaches for \"unstructured\" LDAS (abstract, intro, figure 1, etc.). This is somewhat of a misnomer since these problems *do* exhibit structure (i.e., the action space is such that actions that are close in embedding space yield similar Q-values and lead to similar outcomes when actuated in the environment). I think a better term would be *irregularly* structured. Similarly, the proposed method applies to *regularly* structured action spaces.\n\n**C2**. Related to the second point of W2 above, the paper mentions the use of \"SA to efficiently search across different and potentially better neighborhoods\" (Discussion on p6). While this statement potentially applies for the memory efficiency, it certainly doesn't in terms of time, and should be qualified. SA in general is not computationally efficient.\n\n**C3**. Small nitpick: \"Constraints 2\" -> \"Constraint 2\", etc. in the text at the end of Section 2."
