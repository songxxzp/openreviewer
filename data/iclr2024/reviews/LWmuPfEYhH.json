On the other hand, the paper introduces an attention mechanism in value decomposition to enhance agent coordination in the role space. By introducing the above two contributions, ACORM performs better than other role-based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms in the SMAC environment. The paper also has intuitive visualizations to illustrate the role of the corresponding modules."

In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, inferring the role of an agent based on its trajectory is not a novel method and has been proposed in many previous works [1, 2]. Moreover, none of the above-mentioned important papers are cited in the paper.\n2. The number of baselines used for comparison with ACORM is relatively tiny. Why not use CDS [3] as a baseline, since you mentioned it in the paper?\n3. SMAC is a relatively old multi-agent testbed. Recently, it has been pointed out that it has a series of problems [4]. I am not against the author evaluating the performance of the algorithm on SMAC, but I feel that the performance of the algorithm should be tested in multiple different domains. Many environments, such as the Google Research Football [5] mentioned in the paper, can be used to enhance the credibility of experimental results.\n4. Ablation experiments are insufficient. Compared with the vanilla QMIX, ACORM_w/o_MHA still has an additional MLP and GRU for the global state. One wonders whether what really works is just the representation learning of the state trajectory before input to the Mixing Network.\n5. It is not possible to reproduce the results from the description given in the paper. Some key details (such like $T_{cl}$) are unclear, and some key resources (code) are not furnished.\n\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Cao, Jiahang et al.

Hope there will be additional experiments in a wider range of environments and on more maps within SMAC.\n2.\tThe author did not provide the source code to verify.\n3.\tThere might be some errors in the analysis. Such as the analysis in Appendix D, there is room for debate regarding the phenomenon of sub-groups. It is incorrect to measure the distance between 2 points within 1 cluster in the original space based on their proximity in the t-SNE space. Evaluating the emergence of sub-groups should start from the original space rather than the two-dimensional space after t-SNE reduction. Similarly, after t-SNE reduction, the distance between clusters still does not reflect the real distance. Therefore, the conclusion of 'their role representations are still closer to each other' in the later part still requires the author's reconsideration.\n4.\tThe relationship between the two parts, MHA and CL, in the article is not particularly close; they seem more like two relatively independent components.\n5.\tThere are some typos and the writing of the paper needs some improvement."

I would like to see an additional MAPPO experiment on 3s5z_vs_3s6z.\n3.\tHow is the setting cluster_num = 3 applied on the map 2c_vs_64zg when there are only 2 agents available for control on this map? Besides, why didn't the performance decline since it forces the strategies of each agent to diverge as same as the experiment about cluster_num = 5 applied on the map 5m_vs_6m?\n4.\tIn the derivation, both the approximation and logK indicate that a larger value of K yields better results. The experiments conducted in the selected maps have a limited number of agents. It is suggested to have more agents and experiment with larger values of K. For example, experiments with larger K values, such as K=2, 4, 8, 16, can be run in scenarios like 30m and bane_vs_bane.\n5.\tThe paper doesn't explicitly clarify the difference between clustering directly on agent embeddings and on role representations. As it considers role representations to be more discriminative, it's important to further elucidate the necessity of obtaining discriminative representations through contrastive learning.\n6.\tThe model has been added with a global state GRU and a MHA structure. Therefore it increase the number of parameters of the networks. It is recommended to conduct ablation studies with the same network size.\n\nMinor: Bigger size of networks and additional contrastive learning procedure may limit the application. The theoretical derivation of Theorem 1. is very similar to previous work."
