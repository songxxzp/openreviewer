This inclination becomes evident in scenarios like negotiations, where large language model might naturally champion causes like environmental conservation. However, even with a predefined game context and role, the large language model might not consistently align with the reward mechanism of its assigned role. For instance, when trained with contrary objectives, such as being \"malevolent\", an large language model might easily counter proposals it would have otherwise endorsed. Given this predisposition influenced by underlying values, I question the appropriateness of evaluating an large language model's capabilities in a game setting susceptible to such biases.\n\n- The authors have conceptualized a text-based game to assess LLM agents' actions and subsequently compared different LLMs' performances within this framework.

The paper also provides some insight on the robustness of LLM-based decision makers to adversarial behavior in multi-agent scenarios.  \n- The paper introduces a new testbed, suitable for studying negotiation capabilities of large language models.

Due to this property of the experimental setup, it is hard to say whether the conclusions made from the experimental results would generalize to negotiation tasks that deviate from this structure. Admittedly, the paper considers a couple of variants of the base negotiation game, but it's not clear whether they constitute a sufficient set of robustness checks. \n- From a conceptual/technical point of view, the novelty of this work is somewhat limited. Similar experimental protocol have already been considered by prior work, for example, in (Ghandi et al. 2023b), albeit analyzing different aspects, e.g. ((Ghandi et al. 2023b) focus on strategic reasoning). \n- Some results could be easily expanded to provide further insights about the claims made in the paper. Below I outline a couple of potential improvements. \n- The paper rightly recognizes that negotiation requires strong arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning capabilities. However, the current set of results provide only high-level insights regarding these skills. It may be useful to examine combinations of skills, and identify which of them were \"missing\" in unsuccessful instances of the negotiation game. \n-  Additional game variants would help in understanding the generalization of the results in 5.5. For example, it would be useful to have \"All in - two greedy\" or \"Two out\" to support the claims in the section.  \n- One could use mixed populations, where some agents are GPT-4 while others are GPT-3.5. Similarly, for other aspects studied in the ablation studies in Section 5.2, one could create mixed populations."

If so, how would these outcome compare to those obtained by LLMs? \n\n- In the game \"All in - one greedy\"/\"One out\", are all the agents aware that there is one agent that is selfish/adversarial? \n\n- Could you explain the choices of parameters in the negotiation game (the number of agents, options, etc.)?
