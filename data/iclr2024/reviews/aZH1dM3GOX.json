                "value": "This paper studies learning a good representation for multi-task setting. Their definition of a good representation acroos tasks crucially relies on the idea of capturing unique and common properties shared by all the tasks. To do this they solve a constrained optimization problem that orthogonalizes the representations generated by a mixture of experts by applying the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization technique. This results in ensuring independence between the representations. They draw a nice connection between their orthogonal representations to the Stiefel manifold, a particular type of Riemannian manifold where the inner product is defined. In fact they define a Steifel Contextual MDP (SC-MDP) in definition 4.2 that maps any arbitrary state $s$ to a vector representation in Steifel Manifold (consequently these vector representations are orthonormal). They learn this mapping function $\\phi$ (called experts) from the data and while doing so concurrently enforce a constraint so that the learned representations are orthonormal (see eq(1)). Finally, to enforce diversity across experts, they apply the Gram-Schmidt process to orthogonalize the k-representations. They generate the final RL policy by combining these representations with a linear parametrization. Finally, they conduct several empirical evaluation of their algorithm in several standard RL benchmarks."

How do you ensure the balance between exploration and exploitation?

This seems important because in MT7 (figure 2) MOORE is outperformed by PC-grad and MTPPO? Why?\n4) It was vaguely referred to in section 5.1 (below figure 4) that MOORE has a faster convergence rate than other baselines. Can you elaborate on this? Do you believe that diverse representations (the key thrust of this paper) lead to a faster convergence?\n5) The ablation study is somewhat confusing. Observe that the ablation study is done on single-head architecture and you already show in MT7 (figure 1) that MOE is outperformed by MOORE. However, PC-grad and MTPPO outperform MOORE in figure 1 (single head). So it is not clear whether even PC-grad and MTPPO are learning a diverse set of representations. Can you elaborate on this?"

This approach ensures diversity by pushing these representations to exist within the Stiefel manifold, a Riemannian manifold known for its orthogonality properties.

Yet this should be clearly stated in the paper. Furthermore, if not introduced in related work, used baselines should be described (e.g., MTPPO, MTSAC, PCGrad, ...).

                "value": "The authors introduce a novel representation learning method for multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) that promotes orthogonal representations to enhance diversity. Initially, they present a Stiefel Contextual Markov Decision Process (SC-MDP) to interpret the orthogonal representation spaces. Following this, the authors propose a constrained optimization problem that ensures orthogonality in the representations and employ the Gram-Schmidt process to address the constraints. Empirical results demonstrate that their proposed method, MOORE, consistently surpasses previous MTRL algorithms across two MTRL benchmarks."

                "value": "The paper doesn't introduce a method that is fundamentally distinct from the approach in prior work[1], which utilizes a representative parameter set {$\\phi_1,...,  \\phi_k$} and task-specific weight $w_c$ derived from the task-id. The proposed structure for the policy appears to be merely different combinations of the existing learnable parameters discussed in paper[1]. While Paco[1] employs a linear combination of the representative parameters with the task-specific weight as the policy parameters, this paper adopts the same strategy to compute an additional input for policy inputs combined with the state. Moreover, although the authors argue that orthogonality results in more diverse representations, there's an absence of theoretical backing or ablation studies to corroborate this claim. Given that the vector $k$-representations $U_s$ is contingent upon the state $s$, the authors cannot guarantee representational diversity at the task level, even if state-level orthogonality is ensured. Additionally, the paper does not address issues related to complexity and memory requirements. Storing a set of parameters for representation implies that the proposed \"MOORE\" method could demand significant memory and computational resources. Finally, the authors should benchmark their method against the MT50 benchmark from Meta-World, as all their experiments are conducted on a limited task set size.\n\n[1] Sun, Lingfeng, et al. \"PaCo: Parameter-Compositional Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 21495-21507."
