EF has been around for almost a decade(Siede et al 2014), and suitable theory had been developed for its variant EF21 (Richt\u00e1rik et al 2021). In this work, the authors improve the analysis of EF21 by allowing for larger step sizes through a refined analysis of varying smoothness constants of the different client loss, leading to an improvement from the quadratic mean to the arithmetic mean of the respective constants.\nThey describe how they came up with this idea, and by doing this they propose a variant of EF21 called EF21-W which weights the different client gradient inversely proportional to their smoothness constant. They also provide n improved analysis of EF21 is achieved by extending an analogous analysis of EF21-W.\nIn the supplementary material they extend the algorithm to more advanced versions like EF21 SGD which uses stochastic gradients instead of gradients and EF21 PP which requires partial participation of clients. The authors also provide experimental results for logistic regression with non-convex regularization. They show significant improvement for largely varying smoothness constants and very limited improvements for more balanced cases."
