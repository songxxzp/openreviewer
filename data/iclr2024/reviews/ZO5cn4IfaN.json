Building on prior work that perform multiple training iterations with local updates before each global model synchronization, CO2 enables further throughput improvement by making the global synchronization asynchronous and overlapped with the next round of local updates. CO2 proposes two techniques for addressing the convergence issues of the asynchrony: (i) staleness penalty gap, and (ii) outer momentum clipping. The paper presents theoretical analyses of the convergence guarantees of these two techniques. The evaluation results show that CO2 can achieve convergence results comparable to baselines that are fully synchronous (e.g, Adam) and better than those using local updates (e.g, LocalSGD). The experimental results also show the throughput and scalability of CO2 are better than Adam."

I was unable to determine whether the good convergence results are achieved with $\\tau$ that also provides throughput benefits. \n\n2. The paper is silent on the memory overheads of CO2 relative to baselines, even though Algorithm 2 suggests that multiple copies of the model is required to support asynchronous communication. \n\n3. Equation 3 assumes learning rate decay in the inner loop which is not true for learning rate schedules, such as cyclic, which involve learning rate increases. \n\n4. It is unclear to me whether CO2 can achieve expected throughput benefits in scenarios with parallelism techniques (e.g., tensor slicing, sequence parallelism, and zero stage 3) that introduce communication to forward/backward passes.

To ensure good convergence, CO2 computes a staleness gap metric and uses this to scale updates, as well as a clipping mechanism to limit the variance of updates.

While the idea is relatively straightforward, it includes some details to get it to work well in practice.\n2. The paper adequately specifies its proposed algorithm and includes some theoretical justification to support its claims.\n3. There are extensive experiments on a variety of models, including relatively large ones, demonstrating roughly equivalent convergence curves, indicating that the method does not compromise learning.\n4. Scalability studies are also conducted, showing slightly improved performance on high-bandwidth networks and significantly improved performance on low-bandwidth networks relative to a standard allreduce implementation."

                "value": "1. I think the claims of \"perfect 100% scalability\" are a bit oversold. This relies on appropriately selecting $\\tau$, the number of local steps between global communications; it seems clear that if you can arbitrarily set the amount of computation done to hide communication, you can easily hide it. (Though I wish to be clear that the paper is clear that you can't make $\\tau$ arbitrarily high and still achieve good convergence.) This also neglects other aspects of training which may limit scalability (e.g., I/O for data ingestion).\n2. The paper does not provide guidance on selecting an appropriate $\\tau$, and in its experiments searches over a small set of potential values. This seems like a challenging parameter to tune in practice, as it could significantly increase hyperparameter tuning costs.\n3. It is not clear to me how the paper improves upon existing communication-efficient works which try to tune the communication frequency to achieve both good learning and runtime performance. In particular, works like Wang & Joshi, \"Adaptive Communication Strategies to Achieve the Best Error-Runtime Trade-off in Local-Update SGD\", or Haddadpour et al., \"Local SGD with Periodic Averaging: Tighter Analysis and Adaptive Synchronization\", seem like relevant points of comparison.\n4. The paper lacks implementation details. Specifically, it does not specify how the asynchronous allreduce is implemented (e.g., is it using a NCCL allreduce on a separate CUDA stream?). It is also not clear whether the asynchronous allreduce is operating on a separate weight/gradient buffer from the one being used for computation; or what the memory overheads of the method are.\n5. While I appreciate that the experiments were run multiple times (Section 4.1), the results do not include any measure of variance. This makes it hard to understand whether CO2 amplifies the variance between runs and how much methods actually differ.\n6. Scalability is only evaluated on one model. I would be interested to see how models other than the TransNormer-LLM scale; in my experience, smaller models tend to benefit less from communication optimizations as they are already often able to hide most communication.\n7. The scaling study in Section 4.3 does not include any comparisons with other communication-efficient methods. Given that SlowMo demonstrates very similar convergence curves, it seems prudent to see whether CO2 offers better scalabiltiy.\n8. From a performance perspective, the paper is missing a detailed analysis substantiating its claims. In particular, the communication/computation overlap achieved is never actually measured."

How should $\\tau$ be selected? Is hyperparameter tuning the only way to do so?\n3. How does the paper improve upon prior works which tune the communication frequency (see above for some references)? Could these approaches be used to tune $\\tau$ automatically?\n4. Please add implementation details and a discussion of memory overheads. I think memory may be especially relevant for larger models such as LLMs.\n5. Please add the observed variance to the accuracy results. It would also be good to include error bars in the scaling performance results.\n6. How do other models considered in the paper (e.g., ResNets or ViTs) scale?\n7. How do other communication-efficient (e.g., SlowMo) methods scale on the fast and slow network?\n8. How much communication/computation overlap is actually achieved by CO2, particularly at scale?\n9. A more minor point: The paper refers to gradient bucketing as a way to overlap communication and computation (e.g., in Section 1). I think this is not quite correct; rather, gradient bucketing is a latency/bandwidth tradeoff (performing fewer allreduces on larger buffers). While this can be more efficient, and consequently improve communication/computation overlap, it does not itself enable overlap.\n\n-----\n\nIn light of the authors' response and promised updates, I have raised my score.

                "value": "* While I am not an expert in distributed optimization, to my understanding, similar methods allowing full overlap of communication and computation have been proposed previously. See, for example, [1] from the related work section: on page 17, they state that \"as long as the number of local updates \u03c4 is large enough, the communication can be fully overlapped with the local computation.\" This appears to be quite close to the primary contribution of this work, therefore I believe that the submission needs to describe the key distinctions from prior work in more detail.\n* I think that the experimental setup description could benefit from more details. For example, while the authors mention that their hyperparameters were tuned \"to find the optimal balance between efficiency and performance\", we do not see neither the exact values of $\\tau$ for each experiment nor the exact description of the tuning procedure. Also, authors mention that they leverage ZeRO for TransNormer experiments, but do not state the exact type of the optimizer within that family.\n* Lastly, the majority of model sizes used in this work have quite small parameter counts (fewer than 1B), and therefore it is a bit surprising to see communication as the bottleneck for training even on 80Gbps networks. I think that it would be beneficial to provide more detailed breakdowns of computation and communication times (for example, the time to process 1 microbatch and 1 batch of data, as well as the time to exchange parameters) in each setting to demonstrate the necessity of large $\\tau$.\n\n[1] Cooperative SGD: A unified Framework for the Design and Analysis of Communication-Efficient SGD Algorithms.

Do you have any explanations of that phenomenon?"

This technique is particularly useful when there are a large number of GPU nodes and the inter-connection between nodes are very slow. Compared to previous works, this paper introduces (1) penalty on stale momentum (2) momentum clipping. Empirical ablations show these two techniques are crucial to improve the training convergence performance. The authors also conducted extensive empirical studies, including experiments on image classification, large language model training, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

For example, totally overlapping communication and computation has already been achieved. like Wang et al, 2020. Overlap-Local SGD. The authors should include more discussions on the differences. or even include this method as a baseline.\n- It is not very clear the convergence analysis was performed on which algorithm. Does the analysis consider staleness penalty and momentum clipping? Also, the convergence analysis looks like following previous works. It'd be better to cite few at the very beginning of the analyses."
