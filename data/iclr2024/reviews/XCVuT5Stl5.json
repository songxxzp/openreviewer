Could you please explain the rationale behind considering sensitivity across the entire input domain in the definition of the sensitivity measure, while our dataset (and hence our optimization) may only belong to a small manifold of the input domain?\n\n2. The issue raised in the paper is the out-of-distribution prediction of the surrogate model for the black-box function. However, the paper solves it by using another surrogate model without addressing the out-of-distribution prediction of the model. For example, $\\Phi(\\gamma_i;w)$ is approximated with a neural network. It may also suffer from the out-of-distribution prediction, especially for the high dimensional input $\\gamma_i$ which has the same dimension as $\\phi$ (the parameters of a neural network). Hence, it raises a concern about the approximation quality.\n\n3. $\\Phi(\\gamma_i;w)$ is either $0$ or $1$. Is it reasonable to approximate it with a neural network?\n\n4. It is also unclear how tight is the upper bound of the sensitivity in Lemma 2. This issue deteriorates when this upper bound is further approximated using a first-order Taylor expansion. Hence, the resulting impact on the approximation quality is unknown.\n\n5. Even though $\\omega$ is trainable, its range still needs to be set manually to avoid the sensitivity measure being vacuous. This may be difficult in practice. Furthermore, other parameters such as $\\alpha$ and $\\lambda$ also need to be manually set."

Another thing is whether it is reasonable to use the same $\\sigma_{\\sigma}$ for all parameters, given that some parameters may be very small while other parameters are larger (as these are parameters of a neural network).\n\n3.
