This uniform data representation allows different datasets to be organized in a consistent manner. Thus, a model trained on this standardized format can effectively generalize across various tabular datasets.\n\nOn unseen datasets, the proposed model achieves superior performances and saves training time."

                "value": "The dataset used in this study is somewhat limited. Although I have confidence in the model's ability to generalize effectively to new datasets by representing data points in terms of their similarity to prototypes, there are concerns about its adaptability to other datasets. The reason is straightforward: the issue of feature heterogeneity remains partly unresolved, as there may not be a latent state that aligns to all decision boundaries with similarity measure. The top-K operation on prototypes helps to mitigate this problem to some extent but doesn't completely address it. For example, any transformations applied to the features within the tables, like replacing a feature 'x' with '1/x' (such transformation is reversible, and the information has not been altered or lost), might make the hidden states fail. Therefore, I suspect that this model might only exhibit robustness on certain datasets, and it would be beneficial for the authors to clarify this point and clarify about when the model is effective and when it is not. Otherwise, this paper may potentially lead to misinterpretations in subsequent research.\n\nIt might be also advisable to consider using benchmark datasets like those in Taptap (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09696.pdf) or Grinsztajn's work (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/0378c7692da36807bdec87ab043cdadc-Supplemental-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf) to enhance the credibility of your finding. Perhaps incorporating the average rank and rank standard deviation (like XTab) can provide deeper insights into this research."

Then the model selects the K smallest distance values, where the resulting vector of length K forms the meta-representation $\\phi_c(x_i)$. For classification tasks, one can train a mapping between the representation vectors and the classification scores using a combination of MLP and Transformer.

Two heterogeneous tables can have different label distributions, even if feature columns have similar distributions between the two tables. Due to this inconsistent characteristic, fitting one table's distribution to that of another table may not work well.\n\n\n3. I believe you should clarify the claim, whether the proposed model is for extracting representations or classifying data labels. If the model includes both calculating the representation $\\phi$ and training $\\textbf{T}_{\\theta}$, then the model should be a classifier, not just a representation method. This is because only with the proposed representation $\\phi_c$, one cannot directly perform other tasks.\n\n\n4.
