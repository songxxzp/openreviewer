PART shows improved model robustness and accuracy compared to existing defenses. This performance enhancement is observed across datasets such as CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Tiny-ImageNet, even in the face of diverse attack strategies, including adaptive ones."

I think they should specify the number of training sessions required for AT and PRAG during training;\n3.

The authors\u2019 description of the results in the figures and tables is not clear enough. For example, some of the tables seem to have standard deviations, while some do not. The authors didn't mention how many runs the standard deviation was calculated; The typography of the font, shadows, and content in the table are not compact enough.\n5. Authors should probably consider more AT methods using CAM techniques mentioned in related works for comparison, instead of using many experimental results to compare different CAM techniques, since these techniques including naive CAM techniques seem to be existing\n6. The authors do not seem to consider the impact of the number of attack iterations on the robustness in the results of white-box attack defense, such as the performance of PGD-10/50 and other attacks.

All-in-all, my question is: is PART really useful when there are many other adversarial training regimes that go beyond FGSM and that implicitly incorporate the image structure in the adversarial optimization?\n\nI am not an expert in the adversarial robustness literature, so I am curious to hear what other reviewers say about this proposed training framework. I am willing to change my mind depending on the rebuttal and on knowing what the other reviews have to say about this paper.\n\nPerhaps another interesting question that I would have liked authors answer is.
