Unlike other approaches which have to learn a model for each preference, ICBL can handle arbitrary number of preferences under limited compute by updating a knowledge base (aggregated over tasks) as a convex hull over model parameters. As only extreme point of the hull have to be stored, this can be done with lower memory requirements. Leveraging this knowledge base, preference-addressing models can be generated without training, and have guarantees w.r.t. Pareto optimal parameters.\nResults on four image classification and NLP benchmarks show convincing results with effectively no negative backward transfer."

                "value": "In this section, I include both issues I have with the paper, and general questions regarding my understanding of the proposed approach.\n\n__Weaknesses__\n\n* The paper itself is too dense - a lot of the crucial intuition and motivation is moved to the appendix, which makes the main paper very difficult to parse, for example\n\t* Separation and placement in literature of the proposed method IBCL and MAML/BMAML (App. A).\n\t* The reason for working in a bayesian CL setting (App. B)\n\t* The importance of the particular task similarity assumption (App. E)\n\t* Limited discussion on how preferences are formalized (App. G)\n\t* Very basic experimental details on the CL experiments (App. J)\nWithout continuously looking at the supplementary, understanding both key elements of the method and its motivation become in parts near impossible. This specifically refers to the reason behind bayesian CL, and details regarding the made assumptions. It would be great to see that changed.\n\n* The proposed setup seems contrived - in particular the continual aspect, with both examples provided in the introduction primarily highlighting the multi-task nature of the problem. The continual aspect seems to be mostly a sidenote (e.g. \"preference may even change over time\"). Similarly, the authors only provide limited references for the relevance of the described problem scenario where a large number of preferences has to be accounted for continually over time. It would be great if the authors could offer some more clarity here.\n\n* I may be missing something here, but the authors list poorly performing models to also be sampled from the HDRs, and require separate evaluation on a withheld validation set. This seems like a rather crucial point to elaborate on - what exactly is the rate of poorly performing models, and how dependent is ICBL on selection using validation metrics?\n\n* The experimental studies are limited, and only compares to a single continual learning method, while not providing any context as to why GEM was selected in particular. Are other methods not suitable for this scenario? Similarly, can ICBL not be deployed on standard, single-preference continual learning benchmarks? This would be great to understand, and if not, why. \n\n\n__Questions__\n\n\n* What drives the definition of the Assumption 1 for Task Similarity? In particular, how close it is to a realistic assumption (in particular F being a convex subset of \\Delta_{xy})? Conceptual motivation for such a key assumption would make it easier to grasp the proposed approach quicker.\n\n* Intuitively, it seems like the diameter of the convex subsets F (r) could connect to the expected continuous distribution shifts that can be handled. Is that right? And generally, how does the choice of r drive/change the behaviour/applicability of ICBL?"

When the results are evaluated, IBCL has sublinear growth; however, the compared method GEM/A-GEM uses a fixed-size buffer. In this scenario, how do the authors ensure a fair comparison? Also, the L2P is a replay-free model, which is not a fair comparison since the model used the replay buffer. What is the buffer growth rate, and how does the performance change with the sublinear growth? \n2. The baseline papers are outdated; the recent work shows much better results even without replay samples. Please include the recent replay-based model in the baseline. Also, the L2P (is only a recent model) is a replay-free prompting-based model and there are many updated prompting-based approaches [a, c], etc. which should be included in the baseline. \n3.
