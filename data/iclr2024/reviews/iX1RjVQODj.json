To solve this problem, the authors introduce a novel approach called Contrative Preference Learning (CPL). This method leverages a regret-based model of human preferences, from which a contrastive objective is derived with the principle of maximum entropy. This approach bypasses the need for reward learning and RL, instead directly learn the policy through a supervised learning paradigm. To evaluate the effectiveness of CPL, the authors conducted experiments within the offline PbRL setting, comparing it against strong baselines in terms of the success rate across distinct tasks in the Metaworld domain. The experimental results show that CPL outperforms baselines with less runtime and smaller model size. The primary contribution of this work lies in the conversion of the traditional two-phase PbRL framework into a novel paradigm capable of directly learning the policy with a new contrastive objective."

Moreover, it can be applied to arbitrary MDPs. I feel this approach can be seen as a counterpart to DPO, as discussed by the authors in the paper\u2014one for NLP tasks with LLMs and the other for continuous control tasks. This work has the potential to make a significant impact in the community, and I am eager to see how CPL performs in broader applications.\n\nGenerally, the organization and presentation of the content are well-structured, facilitating ease of reading and comprehension. The authors provide comprehensive theoretical proofs that make the work sound. The experimental results are impressive in terms of runtime, model size, and performance. In the limitation section, I appreciate the authors acknowledge the imperfections of the human model and raise considerations regarding the application of this approach to online human feedback."

                "value": "1. I still have questions regarding regret-based preference model. I agree with the authors that the regret-based preference model makes more sense when we consider the hand-engineered example in section 2. However, when we talk about data collection with a real human, the human labeler would have a preference over two trajectory segments. This implies the existence of underlying dense rewards that explain the human's preferences. In such cases, I feel that the key issue lies in the hand-engineered reward is incorrect (i.e., reward design issue) in your example, rather than in the issues of the reward-based preference model.\n\nTherefore, when we consider experiments with real humans and apply the reward-based preference model, could it also perform effectively? Is it possible that the learned reward captures the regret information to a large extent? Please correct me if I have misunderstood.\n\n2. Despite considering the model complexity of CPL, the results are promising. In terms of feedback efficiency, does CPL require more human preference data compared to the conventional two-phase PbRL framework in order to perform well? This is especially relevant considering the Metaworld tasks in the experiments, where obtaining dense data could be challenging if collected from real humans.\n\n3. In the experiments, the authors pretrain the model with behavior cloning. To what extent does this pretraining phase impact the model's final performance? Does P-IQL also have this pretraining phase?\n\n4. Similar to DPO, CPL employs a supervised learning framework without reward learning and RL. Does it potentially lose the generalization power of RL?"

The loss function ensembles the contrastive learning objective and can be optimized directly without learning a reward function. As a result, the method can scale to high-dimensional environments and sequential RLHF problems (i.e., beyond contextual bandits). Theoretically, by optimizing the loss function, CPL provably converges to the optimal policy of the underlying max-entropy RL problem. The paper tests one instantiation of the CPL framework and shows its promising performance in practice."
