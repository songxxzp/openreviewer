There is no evaluation setup that focuses on enzymes with annotated activity on multiple substrates. In part this is because Swissprot, the training data, only contains annotations for enzymes' natural function, while there are many other reactions that these enzymes could catalyze in the lab.\n\nThe paper boasts about incorporating 'biology priors', but the actual solutions aren't particularly novel or biology-specific. For example, the authors use a learned attention head to pool per-residue embeddings into a per-sequence embedding. The motivation about attention as focusing on active site residues is tenuous and post-hoc. Attention-based pooling is common these days. Similarly, another 'biology' detail is that the labels are hierarchical in nature, and the loss function is adjusted such that the similarity of 2 proteins' embeddings reflects the degree of their similarity in terms of the hierarchy of function. There's nothing biology-specific about training models with hierarchical labels.\n\nIt's unclear if the benchmarking setup is fair to baseline models. See below."

If not, how is the comparison fair?\n\nI'm confused by the motivation for changing the clustering threshold for de-duplicating the training data. To me, the key quantity when assessing the difficulty of an extrapolation task is the distance between evaluation examples and training examples. How does this distance change as you vary the training threshold? \n\nCan you elaborate on the concept of 'promiscuity'? In what sense are you tackling the promiscuity problem?\n\nI was confused by the statement in the intro that 'only 570K (\u223c 0.3%) sequences have been manually annotated with computational methods that bridge the sequence-annotation gap.' Surely there are far more sequences in uniprot with computationally-derived functional annotations. Do you mean that there are 570K sequences with human-curated annotations (i.e., Swissprot)? \n\nI found fig 4 unsatisfactory, since the distributions seem to overlap so much. Is there a way to quantitatively evaluate this separation, such as a precision/recall/f1 for classifying residues as occurring in the active site?"
