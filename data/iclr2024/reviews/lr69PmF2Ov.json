The main working logic of DMPT is as follows: 1) perform mean-shift to find part tokens, 2) update the part tokens based on part deformation constraint, and 3) match the part tokens with the part classifiers. Through iterative optimization, DMPT identifies the most discriminative part tokens, enabling the capture of fine-grained semantics and activation of the complete object extent. Extensive ablation studies and comparisons with the other methods are conducted on the PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets. Notably, DMPT also can be integrated with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)."

I am particularly interested in the extent to which the part-classifiers effectively learn semantically meaningful parts and consistently activate similar parts in diverse images. Interestingly, the person sample in Figure 2 in the supplementary material does not seem to achieve this. Could the authors explain this?\n\n2. I have reservations about the validity of the token-classifier matching, especially in the following two scenarios. In the rebuttal, visual results for these cases would be appreciated:\n\n* When some parts are missing in the input image due to occlusion or other factors. In such situations, do the part-classifiers corresponding to the missing parts get correctly excluded in the matching matrix?\n\n* Additionally, does the matching mechanism adequately handle cases of over-segmentation? It seems possible that sometimes K can significantly exceed N, especially as there is no constraint on K. In such cases, a single part-classifier should ideally be matched with multiple tokens. \n\n3. It would be valuable for the authors to explain their criteria for determining N, the number of part-classifiers. The optimal number of parts may vary across different classes and datasets. Complex classes like bicycles might require more parts, while classes with simple shapes (e.g., a ball) may need fewer. Can the authors elaborate on their approach to determining the number of part classifiers in various scenarios?\n\n4. I think SAM itself can handle this task to some extent. Using the given point annotations serve as prompts for SAM, we can obtain pseudo-labels simply. Can you check this setting and compare it with your DMPT-SAM?\n\n[Minor]\n\nThe notations are somewhat distracting, but honestly, I haven't come up with a better alternative. The core concept of this paper appears to be pretty intuitive to me. However, its mathematical formulation makes the understanding rather complex. It would greatly enhance the paper's clarity if the authors could improve its presentation."
