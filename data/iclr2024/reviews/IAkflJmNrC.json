The experimental results are kind of trivial to me. \u201cPolarity\u201d and \u201cSemantic\u201d can have distribution overlap but are not exactly the same. So if you finetune the sentence embedding methods based on polarity perspective, it is quite common that it will suffer on the semantic dimension.\n3. The definition of semantic score is confusing to me. Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems that if you finetune your sentence embedding models on whatever data, the semantic score will always decrease, since the finetuned model is diverging from the original parameters.\n4. What is  w_i in sec 3.2.2? Is it the same as that in sec 3.2.1?\n5. What is the reference model for semantic calculation used in sec 3.3 and sec 4? If I am understanding correctly, in section 4, you are using the base sentence embedding model without further finetuning as the reference model. Is it the same in sec 3.3?\n6. How do you set \\beta in sec 3.2.2?"

This paper addressed the problem of fine-tuning pre-trained sentence embedding models to a classification task while maintaining the ability to retrieve similar sentences. The authors presented two new metrics, the Polarity Score and the Semantic Similarity Score, to analyze the effect of fine-tuning using different contrastive-based losses. The authors argued that we can balance both STS (Semantic Similarity Score) and classification (Polarity Score) performances. To achieve this, the authors also proposed a new method to generate examples for fine-tuning. The example generations selected samples with similar meanings but opposite classification labels.\n\nIn the experiment, the author first established that the models achieved good scores for both semantic similarity and polarity without fine-tuning. The main results of the experiments showed that as we increased the number of samples, the model attained higher polarity scores, but the semantic similarity scores were slightly suffered. Upon further analysis, the authors suggested that the triplet loss performed best in achieving both scores and the margins (\\lambda) did not have a large effect on performance."

In the direction of the model investigation, the experiment setup was based on a single dataset, i.e., fine-tuning and retrieving the same dataset. Consequently, the author could only conclude that the proposed method retained sentence similarity performance within the fine-tuned dataset. It is unclear how this is better than the standard benchmarks that included zero-shot classifications and unsupervised sentence retrieval.\n3. Since the authors introduced the example generation approach, the results would be more meaningful if the authors compared with a baseline (original example generation.)\n4.
