Please clarify the notations regarding distributions, samples and training (test) sets.\n\n2. On page 3 (Section 3.1 Node Feature Anchoring), where are $\\\\mathbf{A}_c$ and $Y_c$ defined?\n\n3. On page 4, \"the anchor/query node feature pair\" is defined as $[\\\\mathbf{X}_i \u2212 \\\\mathbf{C}|| \\\\mathbf{X}_i]$, where $\\\\mathbf{C}^{N \\\\times d} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N} (\\\\mu, \\\\sigma^2)$. How are the shapes of $\\\\mathbf{X}_i$ and $\\\\mathbf{C}$ aligned?\n\n4. For the node classification task, anchoring is sampled from a learned Gaussian. The notations used seem unclear to the reviewer. Could you elaborate on the learning procedures, the loss function used, and the dimensions of the Gaussians? During inference, stochasticity arises from sampling from such Gaussians. Is it possible to display qualitative results of the learned Gaussians, including details such as variance and mean?\n\n\n5. a) For the graph classification task, there seems to be no extra learnable component to create the anchors, but the subsequent MPNN layers are modified to accept features of $d_r \\\\times 2$ dimensions. How does this subtle change affect the number of trainable parameters?\\\nb) The stochasticity appears to arise from the random shuffle of the node features across the entire batch, and the subsequent selection of anchoring $\\\\mathbf{c}^{1 \\\\times d}$. Does creating anchors from a Gaussian distribution work in this case?\\\nc) Conversely, is it feasible to use intermediate representations to construct anchors for the node classification task? Technically, it seems like these could substitute for the learned Gaussian.\\\nd) Furthermore, when randomly shuffling the node features across the entire batch (potentially involving cross-graph shuffling), are there observable impacts attributed to the size of the mini-batch?\n\n6. Can this method be generalized to graph/node/edge level regression tasks?\n\n7. The design of shuffling across batches in this paper appears conceptually somewhat similar to the mixup method [1] in the feature space. A comparison between them would be interesting.\n\n8. In Fig. 6, Tables 4/5, the effects of applying G-\u2206UQ on top of the pretrained model (GPS) seem very marginal.\n\n[1] mixup: Beyond Empirical Risk Minimization, ICLR 2018."

                "value": "W1.\tSome of the methods employed to translate stochastic centering to the graph domain appear somewhat heuristic, or are at least the text describing the methodology does not provide sufficient detail to perceive the design principles. For example, the node feature anchoring fits a Gaussian distribution, but there is no explanation as to why a Gaussian is selected and no discussion as to whether the mismatch between the fitted anchor distribution and the feature distribution has a negative impact or could be a concern. The text states that the introduction helps to \u201cmanage the combinatorial stochasticity induced by message passing\u201d but it does not elaborate on this to explain why or how. For the graph anchoring, there is a random shuffling of the node features over the entire batch. There is no discussion of this design choice \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem obvious to me that this is the only thing one could choose to do (or the optimal). \n\nW2.\tDistilling the methodological contributions, we see that they involve: (i) node anchoring via fitting a Gaussian distribution and drawing an anchor from this fitted distribution; (ii) hidden layer anchoring by randomly shuffling the node features after the r-th layer. After these steps to construct appropriate anchors in the graph domain, there is effectively a standard application of the stochastic centering approach. The technical methodological contribution is thus not particularly substantial. On the other hand, the experiments are thorough and provide a good balancing contribution. \n\nW3.\tSome of the results are not presented in a particularly helpful manner and are not described or discussed in much detail. For example, the observations for node classification essentially boil down to \u201cour method works better\u201d. The table contains interesting elements such as the proposed method failing to improve (WebKB, CBAS \u2013 Concept) or substantially increasing (Cora) the ECE when combined with Dirichlet calibration. But there is no discussion of this. In general there is not a significant attempt to draw detailed conclusions from the obtained results \u2013 similar comments apply to Section 5.3 where again the conclusions are \u201cboth pretrained and end-to-end G-\u2206UQ outperform the vanilla model on 7/8 datasets\u201d and \u201cG-\u2206UQ variants improve OOD detection performance over the vanilla baseline on 6/8 datasets\u201d. Insights beyond \u201cworks better\u201d make a paper much stronger and more insightful. \n\nThere is room for improvement in some of the figures and the explanations of how they are being interpreted. Figure 2 is a particular case in point \u2013 L1, L2, L3, N/A are not clearly defined. The text states that \u201cREADOUT anchoring generally performs well\u201d but does not explain how we should interpret the figure to come to this conclusion. It\u2019s not obvious what \u201cperforms well\u201d means \u2013 what is an acceptable deterioration in performance. The behaviour over datasets and architectures differs considerably and should be discussed. \n\nIn terms of assessing the variability of performance, the paper reports standard deviations over a few trials, but does not make any attempt to assess the statistical significance of the results or to specify confidence intervals on the reported means."

What does it mean \u201cgenerally performs well across datasets and architectures\u201d \u2013 which bars am I comparing to draw this conclusion?

How do I determine when something \u201cperforms well\u201d?\nQ3. \u201cWe emphasize that this distribution is only used for anchoring and does not assume that the dataset\u2019s node features are normally distributed.\u201d This sentence seems to imply that it does not matter if the anchoring distribution matches the data distribution or not. But then why fit the Gaussian distribution to the training data? The fitting procedure implies that there is a need to have an anchor distribution that matches (at least to some degree) the feature distribution.
