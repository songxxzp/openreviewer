                "value": "This paper considers the problem of fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI) within stochastic rising bandits. Specifically, it introduces both pessimistic and optimistic estimators for algorithm design. Building upon these estimators, two distinct algorithms emerge: R-UCBE and R-SR, drawing inspiration from UCB-E and SR as presented in Audibert et al. (2010). Regarding theoretical findings, the authors provide guarantees on the error probability of the two algorithms and investigate the minimal time budget $T$ required for the BAI task. Finally, numerical experiments conducted on synthetically generated data as well as a practical online best model selection problem serve to affirm the superiority of the proposed algorithms."

Even though the authors present some theoretical findings solely under Assumption 2.1, their interpretability is somewhat lacking.\n\n2. The proposed algorithm closely resembles UCB-E and SR for standard multi-armed bandits, with the primary distinction lying in the estimators. I'm not suggesting this is unacceptable, but it does somewhat diminish the novelty of this work. A promising future direction would involve integrating both estimators into a unified algorithm.\n\n3. Since the expected rewards are bounded in $[0,1]$ and non-decreasing, they must converge to some value. Thus, it is not surprising that the error probability lower bound will be matched by R-SR for large $T$. For non-stationary BAI, the algorithm SR is minimal optimal up to constant factors."

In the introduction, the example introduces the SRB is ``the arm improve performances over time'', but the problem setup of SRB is arms whose performances increase with pulls. I personally feel it is the example of adversarial MAB or non-stationary MAB rather than SRB. The experiments still do not give the real-world applications. In fact it's hard for me to figure out real-world scenario (with the neccessary to model as a SRB) that solves practical problems.\n\n- The problem statement is a little bit unclear. Specifically, it is mentioned that SRB is a special case of SRB, but it is never explained what the word ``rested'' means.\n\n- There should be some discussions about the difficulties of applying existing algorithms (or some trivial variants) to solve SRB. For example, it is only mentioned in the experiments that non-stationary MAB algorithms and adversarial MAB algorithms is outperformed, but it is essential to verify that the increasing structure of SRB is crucial both theoretically and empirically."

Two algorithms are proposed to tackle this issue: one is a UCB-typed algorithm, and the other is a successive-reject-typed algorithm. The paper also establishes a sample number lower bound for BAI problem of SRB setting, as well as an error lower bound when the sample number is fixed. The theoretical guarantees obtained show that R-UCBE is optimal but requires additional prior knowledge, while R-SR reduces the dependence on prior knowledge. Empirical results further demonstrate that R-UCBE and R-SR outperform other algorithms in comparison."

Moreover, this situation is influenced by the randomness of the algorithm, similar to the paper's mention that \"$i^*(T)$ may change,\" which is also a result of the algorithm's randomness. While similar assumptions are made in classical MAB settings, in those cases, the algorithm does not have an impact on the best arm."
