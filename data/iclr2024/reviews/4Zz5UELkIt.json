                "value": "The paper would benefit from additional details on the following questions:\n\n1) Why is the MSE a good metric of choice? What is the benefit above other objectives (e.g., minimizing regret)?\n2) What would be the general form of the k-th order influence function?\n3) What is meant by the perturbation of the distribution function induced by Dn? In which sense are the samples perturbed?\n4) Why can the estimator theta(Dn) be considered symmetric? A short mathematical statement would benefit the flow of reading.\n5) What is the formulation of the importance ratio on the entire data? (page 6 might be difficult to follow for non-expert readers).\n6) Similarly, a short introduction/theory of the acceptance-rejection method would be beneficial. I am not convinced that the average reader is familiar with the concept.\n7) The authors mention the flexibility of their approach multiple times. Nevertheless, it is unclear what precisely is meant by flexibility/ which properties make the approach flexible.\n9) How does the performance of DIA-X for different X relate to the data generating mechanism? Can the optimal X be deducted from the data for the presented experiments?\n10) Figure 3: The funnel (standard dev.?) is only plotted for the IV-bias. Why is it not visible for the other cases or the variance plot?\n11) TripAdvisor data: Why was it necessary to synthetically enhance the data? Could you also provide a comparison of the results of the method on the original real-world dataset and the enhanced semi-synthetic dataset? It would also be interesting for the reader if the authors could state the optimal instruments for the real-world dataset.\n\nThe paper has multiple imprecise parts:\n\n1) Background: The theoretical background/ problem setting of the paper is taken from reference 23. In contrast to the original work, the paper lacks motivation for and explanation of the specific problem setting.\n2) Control Variates: The choice of the control variate (section 3.1) should be justified mathematically (possibly in the appendix).\n3) Figure 4: According to the text, one should observe an exponentially increasing variance for IS in the number of samples. However, the figure does not support this statement.\n4) Experiments: The synthetic data generation is not properly described. Furthermore, no details on the networks employed for estimation are stated.\n5) It would be nice to formalize \\pi in Sec 2 upon first experience. \n6) References: Multiple references are incomplete.\n\nThings to improve the paper that did not impact the score:\n\n1) Structure: The structure of the paper can be optimized to facilitate reading. A constant reminder of what will follow later (e.g., Section 4) might confuse the reader more than it aids the flow of the paper. Furthermore, key contributions (e.g. Theorem 2) are referred to the appendix. It would aid the understanding of the theory to have the main results presented as such in the main part of the paper.\n2) Consistency in wording, e.g., importance weighting vs. importance sampling\n3) Multiple times it is unclear if a certain aspect is only assumed or proven. Clarification emphasizes the contribution of the paper.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n1) There are some minor typos and grammar errors in the text."

However, the technical challenge is that adaptivity usually harms the independence among the data.

It will be beneficial to present whether the adaptivity in this paper affects the independence structure and how the authors handle such difficulties.\n2.\tFor the multi-rejection sampling, if $\\pi\u2019$ and $\\pi_i$ are very different, the algorithm might reject many samples before getting a useful one, which can be very inefficient and impractical. Things become even worse when the dimensions of the problem get larger, for example, as the authors mentioned, when the natural language serves as instruments Additionally, it would be good to know how to choose the value of \"k\" in practice.\n3.\tIn the introduction, when summarizing the contributions, I didn't notice a clear mention of the technical challenges and novel aspects of the work. I found several such points in the main text. It would be beneficial, in my opinion, to include them in the introduction, especially since many of the ideas are quite traditional.\n4.\tOne minor point is that the writing can be further improved.\tWhen referring to an equation, it is better to put the equation number in parentheses. The phrase to define $D_{n\\i}$ ($D_n$ except the one in the $log \\pi (Z_i | X_i)$ term) is a little confusing.\n\n\nReference:\n[A] Zhang, K., Janson, L., & Murphy, S. (2021).

The previous works mitigate the bias in estimation of the predictor $f$, but they are often subject to high variance problem. This paper mitigates the high variance problem of the gradient estimator by using influence functions and multi-rejection importance sampling and provides theoretical analysis of the bias and variance of the proposed gradient estimator. Specifically, although there exists a slight estimation error, this paper proposes $\u2207^{IF}L(\u03c0)$ estimator based on influence functions to solve the time-consuming problem caused by re-training and the high variance problem. Meanwhile, this paper proposes a multi-rejection important sampling approach, which has lower variance compared to the traditional importance sampling approach. In addition, this paper proposes an algorithm that is able to design instruments adaptively. Moreover, experiments are conducted on three regimes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
