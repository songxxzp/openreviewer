I am not able to make the connection between these two, especially when the behavior policy is not assumed to be known. \n\nFor the theory part, it seems to me that the authors\u2019 analysis heavily relies on a reduction to an existing work (Lamb et al., 2022). It is hence unclear to me what the new contributions are in this work. \n\nThe experiment setup seems a bit simplified. In Section 4.1, the authors considered a simple navigation task that is 1-step past-decodable. The authors also only provided comparisons with their own alternative methods but no comparison with other existing works is given. In Section 4.1, the authors modified the vd4rl tasks into POMDPs by randomly masking the observations, which is also a bit artificial to me.

A method for reliably accomplishing this would be extremely useful."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "### Main objection\n\nThe paper unfortunately suffers from a major weakness. In addition to the standard k-order Markov assumption on past trajectories, it also makes the surprising and confusing choice to require that the hidden state can also be fully decoded from *future* sequences of observations. While this might have interesting mathematical consequences, it also means that the resulting algorithm, which leverages this assumption to decode state based on future observations, cannot lead to a practical decision-making agent.\n\nIt is of course true that by using future observations, the agent can more accurately recover the true underlying state of the POMDP. But this fact is completely irrelevant for decision making.\n\nConsider the classic Tiger problem introduced by Kaelbling, Littman, and Cassandra (1998), where the agent must listen for some number of time steps in order to reliably ascertain which of two doors contains a tiger so that it can select the other door that is safe to enter. The original version of the problem returns the agent to the starting state immediately after choosing a door, but suppose we extend the problem by an additional time step so that the resulting state after selecting a door would produce different observations depending on the presence or absence of the tiger. This would satisfy the assumptions in the paper under review.\n\nThis paper effectively proposes that the agent simply wait until it has observed whether or not the room it will eventually enter contains the tiger in order to decide what state it is in. But this completely misses the fact that by the time the agent has observed the subsequent room, the crucial decision of selecting which door to open will have already passed!\n\nIt is not at all surprising that the authors are able to replace observations with these decoded states and measure improved offline RL performance, because they are providing the agent with more information than it originally had access to. The issue is that this approach can in principle never be useful for online decision making.\n\n### Other Concerns\n1. The paper is trying to simultaneously tackle the problems of learning a Markov state abstraction and disentangling the agent-relevant features from the non-relevant ones. This adds complexity, and I don't see much reason to tackle these problems in the same paper. \n2. >\"the one-step inverse objective learns an undercomplete representation. Intuitively, it may incorrectly merge states which have locally similar dynamics but are actually far apart in the environment.\"\n\n    I'm not sure this is the correct interpretation. See Allen et al.'s (2021) \"Learning Markov State Abstractions for Deep RL\", which explores the same idea for MDPs and discusses inverse dynamics models in depth. In particular, they show that even for MDPs, inverse models alone are insufficient for learning an abstract Markov representation. It seems that the approach presented in the submitted paper only works because of the inclusion of future information in the decoding process.\n\n    Furthermore, the suggestion that an inverse model can recover all the agent-state features seems incorrect---it may recover all *controllable* features, but what about non-controllable objects that nevertheless affect either the dynamics or the reward? See Thomas et al.'s (2017) \"Independently Controllable Factors\" and Sawada et al.'s (2018) follow-up \"Disentangling Controllable and Uncontrollable Factors\".\n3. The paper never actually defines inverse models anywhere, and the \"algorithm\" (mentioned in the section Forward-Jump Inverse Kinematics (FJ) objective) is only hinted at, never actually presented, even in the appendix.\n4. > *\"... learning in the presence of both non-Markovian and high-dimensional data. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has focused on developing techniques for state space discovery in such a setting.\"*\n\n    I don't understand what the authors could mean by this. It seems to me that there are many such examples. See Ha & Schmidhuber's \"World Models\", Hafner and colleagues' series of PlaNet and Dreamer models, Guo et al's (2020) Predictions of Bootstrapped Latents (PBL), Subramanian et al's (2022) Approximate Information State (AIS), Zhang et al.'s (2019) causal states.\n\n5. I don't find the experimental results compelling either. Why mask out random frames in the frame stack rather than simply truncating the framestack to use the most recent frame? Why use offline RL? The paper claims that the proposed method \"can better capture sufficient information from the partial observations to fully recover the agent-centric state.\" Was there an experiment that actually measured this? And how is it fair to compare cumulative return relative to methods that can't look into the future?"

                "value": "So far I cannot see the value of this approach, since it requires the agent to look into the future to construct its state representation, therefore it cannot make decisions based on that representation.
