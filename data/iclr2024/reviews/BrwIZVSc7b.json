                "value": "1. Aligning point clouds with other modalities, such as images and text, using contrastive learning is not new in the 3D point cloud field. This paradigm has already been explored by previous ULIP (CVPR 2023). The main difference is that ULIP aligns with the CLIP variant, while this paper aligns with ImageBind, which includes an additional audio modality.\n\n2. From my perspective, the introduced Point-LLM seems more like a better utilization of ImageBind-LLM with visual cache. This is similar to learning a projection layer to utilize ISS for 3D generalization, rather than proposing a separate model.\n\n3. Some conclusions are drawn from experimental comparisons that may not be adequately fair.\n    - In Figure 6, ImageBind-LLM takes a single rendered image of the point cloud as input, while Point-LLM takes the raw point cloud itself (please correct me if I am mistaken). However, it seems that the training image-text pairs of ImageBind-LLM hardly include single-view rendered images of CAD models. On the other hand, Point-LLM directly uses point clouds during its training process. Therefore, this might not be fair.  The authors may present results where Point-LLM also uses rendered images as input or feeds multi-view rendered images into ImageBind-LLM. In addition, it would be more illustrative if the authors could provide such a comparison with the concurrent [PointLLM](https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/PointLLM).\n    - When comparing Table 3 with Table 1, the results of ULIP-2 are missing in Table 1.\n    - In Tables 1 and 3, both Point-Bind and ULIP utilize Point-BERT as the 3D encoder. However, they differ in terms of the architecture of the image/text encoder and the training data utilized. For example, ULIP aligns with SLIP (ECCV 2022), which incorporates ViT-L and is trained with 15M data. On the other hand, Point-Bind aligns with ImageBind, which utilizes ViT-H and is trained with billions of pairs."

                "value": "1. In **3D-audio Pairs** of Section 2.2, the authors obtained 9 categories of 3D point clouds paired with extensive audio clips. It would be more informative if the authors could provide information on which 9 categories the audio clips were obtained from and how many of them.\n2. The ImageBind does not require the training dataset that pairs all six modalities. However, the authors have collected a unified 3D-image-audio-text dataset. Table 4 indicates that only Text+3D does not perform well. Can the authors provide any analysis? Furthermore, the inclusion of the image modality greatly enhances performance as shown in Table 4. Therefore, I am curious about the results for Image+3D, if available.\n3. In **Embedding-space Arithmetic** of Section 4.2, Why not use both 3D and audio embeddings from Point-Bind but \"add the 3D and audio embeddings respectively from Point-Bind and ImageBind\"?\n4. In **Settings** of Section 4.4, why not use 64 templates like in equation (2) but \"a simple template of \u2018a [CLASS]\u2019 for the 40/15 categories\"?\n5. Did the authors themselves obtain the results of zero-shot on ScanObjectNN for ULIP and ULIP-2, as shown in Table 3? Is there any analysis explaining why ULIP outperforms ULIP-2?"

While the paper's experimental design is well-executed, it is true that there are other 3D representation methods that could be explored to further validate the robustness and transferability of the proposed methods. For example, the authors could consider using JM3D [1] and CG3D [2] as additional 3D representation methods to be incorporated into their proposed frameworks. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods and help to establish their generalizability across different 3D representation methods.\n\n2. The paper claims to introduce a \u201cnew 3D-image-text-audio dataset\u201d, yet it appears to be a fusion of the existing ShapeNet55 and ESC-50 datasets.\n\n3. One of the insights presented in the paper is the arithmetic of multi-modalities. Conducting additional quantitative experiments could further elucidate and solidify this contribution, thereby substantiating this claim.\n\n4. The paper could be enhanced by expanding on the related work section, including references [3, 4] which have been missed.

As the paper mentions, the final training data comprises only 9 categories from the public portions of ShapeNet55 and ESC-50, which seems insufficient for a pretrained work. Could this limitation impact the robustness of the proposed model?\n\n2. The 3D question-answering capability of Point-LLM appears more akin to narrative construction rather than straightforward answering. Could you provide examples of scene understanding, such as outdoor scenes from autonomous driving contexts or indoor scenes from S3DIS, to substantiate the model's 3D question-answering ability?\n\n3. The extent to which Point-Bind can benefit downstream tasks remains unclear. Providing more qualitative results, as opposed to solely textual descriptions, could offer a better understanding of its efficacy."

This paper follows a similar pipeline to train the Point-Bind model. The major difference is the choice of foundation models, i.e., ImageBind or CLIP. Similarly, the other two mentioned contributions, \"Any-to-3D Generation\" and \"3D Open-World Understanding,\" are also very natural downstream applications of the aforementioned technology. The \"Any\" ability is mainly powered by the Image-Bind model rather than the proposed method. Therefore, these parts don't make much contribution to me.\n\n2: For \"3D Embedding-space Arithmetic\", developing the bridge between modalities for modality-specific feature injection and facilitating the LLM for other modalities are also well developed by the previous works, like the BLIP-2 [4] and MiniGPT4 [5]. The BLIP-2 uses pre-trained multi-modal encoders and only trains a transformer block to adapt the image to the LLM, and the MiniGPT4 further unleashes the interaction ability, which share similarities with the proposed Point-LLM. The major difference is also the point cloud modality. \n\nOverall, I think this paper has technique contributions and could be used widely in the community. However, the paper uses many well-validated techniques, and the main difference is to further verify the conclusion on the point cloud modality. Therefore, I tend to reject this paper at this time.\n\n[1] Xue, Le, et al. \"ULIP: Learning a unified representation of language, images, and point clouds for 3D understanding.\" CVPR. 2023.\n\n[2] Zeng, Yihan, et al. \"CLIP2: Contrastive Language-Image-Point Pretraining from Real-World Point Cloud Data.\" CVPR. 2023.\n\n[3] Liu, Minghua, et al. \"OpenShape: Scaling Up 3D Shape Representation Towards Open-World Understanding.\" NeurIPS 2023.\n\n[4] Zhu, Deyao, et al. \"Minigpt-4: Enhancing vision-language understanding with advanced large language models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.10592 (2023).\n\n[5] Li, Junnan, et al. \"BLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models.\" ICML 2023."
