                "value": "This work presents a novel deep learning algorithm designed to tackle the challenging online 3D bin packing problem (BPP), a crucial combinatorial optimization task with applications across various industries. The inherent complexity of this problem stems from its vast combinatorial search space, which can lead to performance limitations in traditional operations research-based approaches, particularly in terms of speed and the need for domain-specific expertise.\n\nRecent advancements in neural combinatorial optimization offer a promising avenue to address these limitations. Notably, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods can learn policies as effective combinatorial solvers by iteratively interacting with the problem environment, eliminating the reliance on problem-specific domain knowledge. However, it's worth noting that existing DRL techniques for combinatorial optimization have predominantly concentrated on vehicle routing problems (VRPs), leaving the 3D BPP relatively unexplored. Nonetheless, solving the 3D BPP still demands the development of specific techniques.\n\nIn this work, we introduce a permutation packing method and provide a mathematical proof demonstrating its capacity to enhance the approximation capabilities of deep neural networks. Given the potentially vast number of permutations involved, which could lead to increased memory consumption, we also propose a memory-efficient approach for permutation packing. Our experimental results empirically validate the effectiveness of these ideas, underscoring their practical relevance."

Also, using the hessian matrix of a deep neural network could be difficult, the paper should elaborate more on limited-memory permutation.\n    * Missing details in experiments. The paper only have one experiments, which seems follows the experiment in Attend2Pack in section 3.5. However, the paper does not provide any details like how the boxes are generated and how the training and evaluation are performed. Also, the performance of the baselines are different from the number reported in the original papers, making the experiment results less convincing.\n    * The paper spends a lot of space on materials with low relevance. For example, the approximation theory in section 2 and section 3 is necessary to appear in the main text. Using one sentence to introduce the norm $||\\cdot||_{\\Omega, p}$ and the remaining can be put into appendix. \n\n* The soundness of the paper need more justification. The machine learning community has devoted significant effort for the symmetry in neural network. Some results, for example, using neural networks with special architectures like deep sets [1], self-attention [2], DSS layers [3]. For me, using an architected neural network admits symmetry is more straightforward than using the method proposed in this work. The paper should add more discussion, or experiments if applicable, about the difference and the advantage of Permutation Packing compared to these methods.\n\n\n>[1] Zaheer, Manzil, et al. \"Deep sets.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 30 (2017).\\\n[2] Vaswani, Ashish, et al. \"Attention is all you need.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 30 (2017).\\\n[3] Maron, Haggai, et al. \"On learning sets of symmetric elements.\" International conference on machine learning.
