This could be interesting in a hiring scenario, where a firm would hire each month (12 times a year) and finds enforcing demographic parity (DP, i.e., equal acceptance rates) difficult to fulfill at each month, but can commit to fulfilling DP on a yearly base (average across all hiring decisions of the year)."

                "value": "[W1] I have several difficulties to parse the example provided in the introduction. First, why is the proposed medical treatment a fair decision-making problem? Given the framing with individuals seeking medical care as \"demand\" and a medical facility providing healthcare as \"supply\", this appears to me a fair allocation/ranking problem, which is - to my undestanding - different from the general decision making, in having an upper bound on the (usually) positive decision. Second, what is the motivation for a decision-maker to aim for demographic parity (equal acceptance rates) in a medical treatment scenario, i.e., why is it the goal to provide the same proportion of service to blue and red patients? The motivation of the proposed fairness notion lives from the observation that it would be \u201cunfair\u201d to provide nobody of the group of 100 red people with a treatment at time step t, just because we do not provide the 1 blue person at time step t with treatment. I am struggeling to think of a real-world scenario, where a decision-maker would take such decisions, thus I have difficulties to follow the motivation for the example and thus the proposed fairness notion. As indnicated in [S2], it would be easier for me to see an application of this in a hiring scenario.\n\n[W2] If I understood the example and fairness notion correctly, the demographic parity notion from the introduction is only expected to yield a different result than static one-step fairness notions, when i) demographic group sizes vary across time steps and ii) if a) decisions are trivial (i.e., either \u201caccept all\u201d or \u201caccept nobody\u201d) or b) we have one group with a group size 1. Here is a scenario, where i) is fulfilled, but ii) not: When we have 20 non-binary individuals and 100 binary individuals at t, then 80 non-binary individuals and 10 binary individuals at t+1 and fulfill DP with an acceptance rate p \\in (0, 1) at each time step (such that DP-unfairness is zero), then the proposed long term notion yields the same as the single time step notion, e.g., p_t = 0.5, p_{t+1} = 0.25, then |(10+40)/(20+80) \u2013 (50+5) / (100+10)| = |50/100 \u2013 55/110| = |0|. To my understanding from the example, the notion is only useful in a very specific case, which limits its practicality. I am happy to be corrected by the authors, if I misunderstood.\n\n[W3] I find calling some time steps more \u201cimportant\u201d than others misleading. The authors call a time step \u201cmore important\u201d for a demographic group, if there exist more of its members that are seeking a decision at that time step. This means, larger groups are paid more importance to than smaller groups. First, this is an ethical understanding that should be at least mentioned, if not discussed. Second, I find this understanding of fairness especially concerning, if the variance in the group sizes of individuals that arrive at each time step is biased or confounded by another factor. For a given demographic group (e.g., blue ones), individuals who tend to arrive in smaller groups may be treated unfairly in comparison to individuals, who tend to arrive in larger groups. This is because the fairness notion aggregates the blue individuals over all time steps to one large blue group and demands the cummulative decisions across all time steps to be fair to the cummulated blue groups. So this may yield to a type of inter-group unfairness. \n\n[W4] The authors claim on page 2: \u201cWithout considering the variation in temporal importance within a group, these prior metrics lead to a false sense of fairness.\u201d I strongly object the attempt to claim that prior fairness notions are \u201cfalse\u201d, which the authors do several times on page 2. Different fairness notions capture different understandings of fairness and which one to pick is very dependent on the context and scenario, and importantly should be at the heart of different research fields, such as philosophy, ethics, sociology etc. I advocate to remove these strong claims, and additionally merge the related work section with the introduction or put it right after it to contextualize the claims made as well as the motivate the need for a \"new\" fairness notion better.\n\n[W5] In the introduction, the authors keep writing that they measure \u201cbias\u201d, but to my understanding, what they are measuring is not a (statistical, sampling, cofounding etc.) bias, but their moral/ethical understanding of \u201cunfairness\u201d.\n\n[W6] In the conclusion the authors write \u201cHowever, in real world applications, extra constraints on demand might be needed. For example, the demand should not be too large (e.g. when demand is the number of infected individuals) or too small (e.g. when demand is the number of qualified applicants).\u201d I am failing to follow this argumentation. \u201cDemand\u201d in how the users understand it, is the number of individuals a decision-maker is deciding upon at each time step (e.g., loan applicants). I am failing to see, how and why these extra constraints might be needed.\n\n[W7] There are missing citations for the background section, e.g., for Standard MDP. In the experimental section, there are missing citations for each of the three environments considered.\n\n\nMinors\n-\tIn times of increasing research on large language models, I would suggest the authors to pick a different name for their fairness notion than \u201cELBERT\u201d, given the similarity to all the variations of BERT models."

There is no citation given. To my understanding, at a classical sequential decision making scenario, there is at each time step a set of individuals that are required to be made a decision upon, and the decision maker takes the features of the individuals as input and decides usually aiming to maximize their utility while potentially adhering to some fairness notions. The concept of supply and demand comes from economics, where the general standard assumption is that goods demanded/supplied are uniform, i.e., every individual item is the same. This is not the case in fair decision making; every individual is different. There is not a demand and supply of credits and as long as a decision maker can supply credits they will. Instead, they will aim to give the credit to the individuals that they expect to have a high probability of paying back. Could the authors please clarify this?"

As noted by authors, the treatment rate is 0 at time t, and 1 at time t+1 for both groups. I am not sure this is a good motivating example to emphasize the relation between the resource distributed and the group-wise importance of the state. First of all, why the supplies are modeled in a group-specific way from the user (here, is red/blue group) perspective, instead of from the supplier (here, is the hospital) perspective? Second, while I understand authors' emphasis on the fact that ratio is calculated after aggregation, I do not think the proposed modeling is more general than aggregating the supply-demand ratios along the temporal axis. In fact, those two modeling choices are complimentary, each suitable for specific practical scenarios. Third, the proposed long-term fairness notion is not robust towards group size imbalance. Imagine that the group size of red is significantly larger than that of blue, to the extent that even for the most unimportant states of red group, the demand is much larger than the entire population of blue group (and therefore, larger than the demand of blue group even in its most important state). One can imagine that in the calculated ratio, the supply/demand of blue group does not alter the result simply because they are out-numbered to a certain extent. The proposed fairness evaluation, in turn, may not provide sensible distinction between numerical variation and suffering of minority group.\n\n__Question 2__: the claimed benefit of the proposed notion, compared to previous notions\n\nAs a follow-up on previous question, the proposed notion is claimed to address potential issues of previous utilization of static fairness in dynamic settings. Specifically, authors claim that the sequence of applying aggregation and ratio calculation matters. It is true that states have relative importance for each group. The discussion should include more than one (somewhat exaggerating) example to establish the (potential) advantage of ratio-after-aggregation compared to ratio-before-aggregation. To me, these two ways are complimentary, and the proposed notion is not well-motivated enough.\n\n__Question 3__: the \"importance\" of state vs. long-term fairness goal\n\nIf the importance corresponds closely to the absolute size of demand at a given time, it is does not seem natural to model group-specific importance of states for the purpose of achieving long-term fairness. After all, if the focus is on fairness of resource distribution, what is the implication of state importance on long-term fairness, when the importance is only an intrinsic property of a certain state (e.g., if the base population is large)."
