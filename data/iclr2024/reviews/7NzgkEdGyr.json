I am not sure if OFT will be able to outperform the proposed method with some hyperparameter fine-tuning. OFT-SAM is missing in Table 5, and I would recommend authors to add the results for completion. I also have some novelty concerns with the work considering OFT, since the proposed method doesn't provide a noticeable gain over OFT. One question to authors, if there exists some b for OFT that can outperform BOFT with some m, b with similar #params, or BOFT always beats OFT with comparable params."

                "value": "This paper is an extension to [Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT)][oft], which involves modulating a pretrained weight matrix by multiplying it with an orthogonal matrix during finetuning; updating only the orthogonal matrix during finetuning. OFT, for efficiency reasons, parameterise the orthogonal matrix with a block-diagonal structure, with each block using a Cayley parameterization:\n$$\nR = (I+Q)(I-Q)^{-1}\n$$\nwhere $Q$ is a skew-symmetric matrix. The complete orthogonal matrix therefore becomes $\\text{diag}(R_1, R_2, ..., R_r)$.\n\nBecause this orthogonal matrix is an arbitrary choice, the authors state that \"it makes no sense to divide the dimensions of a neuron into $r$ groups based on their indices\". This paper aims to produce a dense orthogonal matrix parameterization.\n\nTo that end they suggest a butterfly parameterisation, where each stage connects each unit to itself and another unit, through which information may flow from any two units after enough stages; inspired by the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform. \n\nThis improvement to OFT is tested by experiment on large language model finetuning for natural language understanding (GLUE), multitask language understanding (MMLU) and mathematical question answering (GSM8K and MATH). It is tested on a vision foundation model (SAM) classification (VTAB-1K) and segmentation (HQSeg-44K). Adapting a diffusion model (stable diffusion) was tested on controllable generation and subject-driven generation. BOFT performed better in most comparisons, except for some results on VTAB-1K and was outperformed by LoRA on some GLUE and MMLU benchmarks.\n\nIn general it was demonstrated as a competitive method for finetuning and a definite improvement over OFT.\n\n[oft]: https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/72033"

This is supported by the experiments in Section 6.\n\nFinetuning large pretrained models is a valuable area of research, it has become neither necessary nor practical to train a model from scratch on new problems.

A similar figure can be found in every book on deep learning, for example opening Goodfellow's [Deep Learning book][goodfellow] there is a figure on page 170 that describes a bipartite connectivist diagram like this. It's possible I am missing something though.\n\nOFT is described well, but it appears too late. It is mentioned early in the paper but a quick description of it comes much later, on page 3. This could be easily fixed by putting Figure 1 earlier. The entire premise of the paper could also be introduced early in that case by putting an illustration of the butterfly parameterisation along with Figure 1 and referencing it on the first page.\n\nTable 5 is in the wrong place, it sits next to a description of the VTAB-1K task, but presents results on the next task. Wrapped figures and tables are used extensively in the paper, which can work well because the results are close to the text referencing them but they need to be placed correctly in that case.\n\nThe paper extends OFT but the improvement appears to be incremental, with minor performance gains on competing methods. The authors mention the spectral benefits of this method over LoRA but do not explore this in detail in experiments, looking only at benchmark results.\n\n[goodfellow]: https://www.deeplearningbook.org/"

            "questions": {
                "value": "I would expect that one of the main motivations for a butterfly parameterisation would be the reduced memory usage at inference time. Unfortunately, I'm not sure this method allows that, as it still requires that the original weight matrix is multiplied with the butterfly factorized matrix before being applied to the inputs. Is there any way this method provides some inference time savings?\n\nIn Section 5 when approximating random dense matrices, what distribution are the matrices drawn from, and is that distribution a good choice for modeling the types of matrices found in deep neural networks or orthogonal deep neural network adapters?\n\nIs there any significant extra computational cost to matrix multiplying the original parameters with the orthogonal matrix adapter? I realise this would be the same issue OFT would have.\n\nHow do you train the butterfly parameterisation in practice? In most autograd frameworks a naive implementation would have a massive memory cost because each layer of the butterfly transform would require it's own cached activations.\n\nDo the spectral properties of LoRA mean it should systematically fail in some way? Can you demonstrate that experimentally and show how BOFT doe not?"
