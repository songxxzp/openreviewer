The paper starts by showing this for on CC12m by training for an extra 15 epochs (Figure 1), then it shows that similar improvements are reached with 2 other models for various number of extra epochs (Figure 3), then shows that the improvements are consistently significant on various OOD datasets (Table 2), then they confirm that restarting training even from early checkpoints can result in faster training (Figure 4), then they extend the idea by repeating the restart by revisiting the idea of cyclical LR schedules and show that a cyclical LR can reach a higher accuracy than a single cycle cosine LR schedule (Figure 5). Finally, they use a cyclical LR schedule to train on the larger LAION400M dataset and conclude that \u201cCLIP models trained on large datasets are less likely to be undertrained.\u201d"

To improve their performance, simply finetuning a pre-trained CLIP model again with additional few epochs with a restarted learning rate scheduler is enough.

The paper shows additional ablations and result comparisons with previous methods to provide a broad perspective."

This work shows that hyper-parameter and tweaking training strategies for large-scale pretraining of vision-language models plays significant roles in determining their performance on downstream tasks after training.\n2. Restarting the LR scheduler with few-additional epochs is a simple and elegant way to improve performance of CLIP models trained on small scale datasets.\n3. The resulting performance of the model is competitive to prior methods that bring additional objective function or model architecture changes to baseline CLIP model.\n3. Most importantly, this study underlines the crucial need of bench-marking at larger scales to truly reflect improvements due on proposed modifications. Otherwise, showing effects on small scale datasets could be sometimes misleading.\n4. The paper conducts fair comparison and additional ablation studies to provide a broad perspective about CLIP training.\n5. Paper is easy to read and well presented."

                "value": "1. In my view, this paper presents a effective but somewhat hyperparameter training technique which is more of a engineering trick rather than pure novel contribution. In other words, this paper says that one should use a altered version of multi-cycle LR scheduler instead of a single-cyle LR schedule to improve CLIP performance.\n2. There is little or no analysis on why the proposed trick helps improve CLIP performance. This work can be further supplemented by conducting a detailed analysis on the learned embeddings, for example analysis on modality gap [1], t-SNE visualizations etc.\n3. This work shows performance comparison on zero-shot tasks, but it will be great to see how the learned embeddings provide benefits for adaptation tasks like linear probing or its use on downstream tasks which uses CLIP features in their framework.\n4. Although competitive to prior methods trained on CC3M and CC12M, it is unclear how this technique performs when combined on pre-trained models of prior methods. For example, does this technique shows complementary effect when plugged on CyCLIP pretrained model? (using same CyCLIP objective functions even in the proposed technique)\n5. Similar results with-and without this technique on large scale CLIP models like CLIP-LAION400M shows that this trick is only valid for small scale models with less than 50% baseline accuracy.  \n6. There are missing tables in the paper. For example, I cannot see Table 1 anywhere in the paper."

It'd be very helpful if the authors can provide some insights here, because this seems to be the core contribution of the paper. For example, does the noise level in the image-text dataset affect the fitting behavior in some way?\n\n2. Many existing CLIP recipes rely on high-resolution finetuning after the low-resolution pretraining (e.g.ALIGN, CoCa), which is essentially doing the same finetuning with the extra cycle as shown in Figure 1 (right). Would the proposed approach still benefit models that are already trained with high-res finetuning? \n\n3. For ablation, I think it'd be cleaner to compare with a baseline that is trained on the same number of epochs so that the only difference is the learning schedule (instead of adding additional training epochs). \n\n4.
