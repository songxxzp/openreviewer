In contrast to existing deep learning approaches to image registration, the approach presented here explicitly integrates a data-fidelity penalty as well as a CNN prior (this is pre-trained and acts as regularizer for the deformation field). The authors argue that this improves the fidelity between the registered image and the reference image. The second approach, PIRATE+, is similar to this but uses a CNN prior that is trained using deep equilibrium models."

Registration accuracy measured in terms of Dice is more meaningful. At the same time, it would have been good if the authors had used some additional non-brain datasets which have landmarks and thus allow the calculation of quantities such as the target registration error. One such dataset is from the EMPIRE10 challenge...\n\n- The run-time of the proposed framework is significantly higher than those of other DL methods.
