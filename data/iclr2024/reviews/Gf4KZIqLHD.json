Contemporary and more innovative backdoor attack techniques warrant discussion. Additionally, the trigger mechanism inherent to BadNets is susceptible to detection, as evidenced by [1].\n\n2. In the main experiments, the surrogate and target classifiers are depicted as identical. This assumption appears unrealistic, especially since adversarial examples are tailored to specific classifiers. When pretraining a backdoored diffusion model, it's implausible to assume knowledge of the exact classifier a user will deploy. The experimental setup in Section 4 contrasts with the experiments, indicating a lack of consistency. A deeper exploration of transferability is imperative; the experiments described in Section 5.4 appear insufficient."

In addition to Clean ACC, I also notice that the performance of DIFF2 on robust acc is even worse, e.g. the robust acc of SDE decreases from  85.6% to 60.3% (-25.3%). It demonstrates that DIFF2 will increase the vulnerability of the diffusion model.\n\n3 All experiments are performed on the small datasets.

Thus, I would suggest use $x_a$ (the adversarial sample of $x$) to substitute $x_a^*$ (Line 6 of Algorithm 1).\n\n2 Can the existing backdoor defense, e.g. ANP [2],  be used to defend DIFF2?

I have such questions (maybe some questions I asked have an answer in the article but I didn't see it, if so, I hope the author can explain it again):\n\n1: Is the noise on the trigger image after passing through the diffusion and denoising a little too big (3 and 4 row of figure 3) to be easy to seen? Generally speaking, budget L_\\infty=8/255 is enough to generate adversarial samples to Cifar10 on ResNet18. Why use 16/255?\n\n2: By 2 row of figure 3, it is not difficult to find that the trigger is basically retained after adding noise. Is it the main reason why the backdoor can be produced?\n\n3: About trigger design, I see that the author random selects a 5*5 trigger and adds it in the lower right corner of the image. May I ask whether the author has considered the design method of trigger\uff1fFor example, considering the invisibility of the trigger, is it possible to select a trigger with L_\\infty norm 8/255 (in this case, trigger can be added to the whole picture but not only a corner)? In other words, is there any advantage in selecting the trigger as described in this article?\n\n4: About the way to generate backdoor, Algorithm 1 requires very high privileges during the training process, including having the victim network f, arbitrarily adding dirty training data, changing loss function (Mixing loss). There is no doubt it works, but it is too straightforward (Directly training the Diffusion models to correspond to the trigger picture and adversarial picture), lacks innovative, which limits its usefulness. Should we consider more practical ways of adding backdoors? At least, it should be stated that adding less poison data and little modification to the training process will enable the backdoor attack.\n\n5: In theorem 1, authors show that KL(q_T,p_T) has a downward trend in relation to T. What I understand \u2018diff(x,T)\u2019 is that: adding noise on x with T steps. If so, my question is: Let x_c be the clean image. When T is big, will diff(x_c,T) close to p_T (I think so, that is why we can use diffusion against the adversarial sample)? If so, is it true that q_T\u2248p_T\u2248diff(x_c,T) when T is big? Do you have any instructions about the comparison between KL(q_T,p_T) and KL(q_T,diff(x_c,T))?"
