Unlike traditional retraining methods that rely on the original data, this study introduces a special proxy generator method and an in-batch tuning strategy tailored for scenarios where the forgetting data predominantly consists of majority class samples. The proposed generator employs a generative approach to create a limited set of proxies for each class, effectively mitigating the impact of imbalanced data on the representation of minority classes. Additionally, the method introduces privacy-preserving measures by using noisy samples as generator seeds rather than relying on original training data. The empirical results demonstrate superior performance in both efficiency and effectiveness, showcasing the method's potential for practical applications."

                "value": "This paper introduces a novel approach to address the challenging problem of imbalanced class unlearning with restricted data access. Unlike conventional retraining methods, the proposed special proxy generator method and in-batch tuning strategy offer a new perspective on efficiently unlearning from imbalanced data, particularly when forgetting data is predominantly composed of majority class samples. The paper's innovative use of a generative approach for proxy generation, as well as the integration of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and in-batch tuning, showcases a creative combination of existing ideas, pushing the boundaries of current knowledge in this domain.\nThe empirical results of this study demonstrate excellent quality in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed method exhibits superior performance, effectively mitigating the impact of imbalanced data on the representation of minority classes. The rigorous experimental validation underscores the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach, ensuring its applicability in real-world settings. Additionally, the introduction of privacy-preserving measures with noisy samples as generator seeds adds an extra layer of quality assurance.\nThe paper addresses a critical challenge in learning from imbalanced data with restricted data access. By focusing on class unlearning, the study not only defines a specific problem formulation but also offers a solution that has potential implications for various domains and applications. The introduction of a method that does not rely on original training data, regardless of forgetting or retaining it, marks a substantial advancement in the field. Furthermore, the efficient use of storage and time resources enhances the practical relevance and impact of the proposed method. The comprehensive empirical studies provided in the paper further solidify its motivation and validate the superiority of the proposed methods over existing approaches."

These clarity issues collectively pose potential barriers to a comprehensive understanding of the paper's technical content.

While this may impose certain limitations on the method's applicability, this unique approach also plays a crucial role in addressing the imbalance issue during generator training."

The framework utilizes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate accurate proxies for the forgetting data, even when it consists predominantly of the majority class. The proposed GENIU is divided into training phase and unlearning phase. During the training phase, the VAE is trained to generate accurate proxies for the forgetting data. During the unlearning phase, the VAE is used to generate proxies for the forgetting data, which are then used to update the model. The paper's contributions include a detailed description of the GENIU algorithm, an evaluation of its performance on several benchmark datasets, and a discussion of its potential applications and future research directions."

However, this can be a critical privacy issue because the generative model itself contains information about the forgetting data. Although this can be discarded after one unlearning process, it cannot be used for the next unlearning process. Therefore, it seems to be an architecture that cannot perform continuous unlearning.\n\n- The generated proxies are mentioned to be far from the decision boundary. In other words, the model successfully classifies them with high confidence. However, the statement that high-entropy data is selected for learning this contradicts this idea. Shouldn't the opposite data be selected for this? The explanation for these aspects is more clearly explained. \n\n- The paper does not address how GENIU scales with significantly larger datasets or more complex models. This leaves questions about its feasibility in highly demanding real-world scenarios. It would be better to provide a more detailed comparative analysis, especially highlighting specific scenarios where GENIU might not be the optimal choice.\n\n- There are sentences that appear to be grammar errors and typos. Examples include \"~ imbalanced data, if train the proxies throught the ~\" in \"4. our method\", \"ALLCNN 20 epochs ~ noise z the\" in \"5. implementation detail\", and \"unmber\" in \"algorithm 1\".

Ultimately, it appears that the authors' idea is correct, but I'm curious about why that is the case.\n\n- During the training process, learning from noisy images is also carried out. Isn't it valid to do this when the performance of the classification model is reasonably assured? Isn't it possible to save noisy images that happened to match when the performance is low?\n\n- I'm wondering whether the authors have considered a method involving the use of a negative value in the formulation of the loss function for forgetting data, as they took the reciprocal.\n\n- Is one mini-batch sufficient? Why is that?\n\n- Could you provide more insight into the assumption that all minority classes have similar data counts?

In the results table, the authors show that after unlearning, the accuracy for the unlearned class is 0.0. I do not understand why there is any merit in this. Throughout the entire paper, there is never any mention of what constitutes a valid \"forgetting\" of a given class (as an exact definition). It seems that the implied definition (based on the results) is that the accuracy on the forgotten class should be zero. I disagree that this is a useful definition.\n- The formulation seems ill-defined. The authors do not do a precise job of describing the setting. For example: how imbalanced must the classes be for this method to work? How large of a fraction of unlearning can this method support? \n- The motivation is unclear -- the authors fail to explain either practical or intellectual motivation for proposing this algorithm.
