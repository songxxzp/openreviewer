It formulates the learning of potential abnormal distribution (i.e. true anomaly-generating mechanism) as a second-order optimization problem. To this end, two aspects are mainly studied: (1) a new validation loss for differentiable distribution matching of augmented training data and the unlabeled testing anomalies; (2) some differentiable augmentation functions for optimizing their learnable control factors and detector parameters alternatively. Experiments on both semantic and non-semantic anomalies demonstrates the effectiveness."

I wonder if the proposed framework can simultaneously deal with multiple different augmentations, since this case is more general in real-world anomaly detection scenarios and is more likely to avoid overfitting to the optimal **a**. It will be helpful to show the results with **UN**split original classes in MV Tech AD.\n\n2.\tThe assumption that the validation and test distributions are consistent may be too strong for the setting of anomaly detection task (*e.g.* new anomaly pattern or even mixing anomalies makes **a** not optimal). It may not be reasonable to omit test images drawn from unseen distributions in real scenarios.\n\n- The author believes that the heuristic function $S$ will be high (higher variance of anomaly scores) *only if* augmentation parameters are initialized better (more separable distributions). However, this may not always hold, as the optimization of a mismatched *strong/hard* augmentation (as long as the decision boundary divides testing distribution into any two parts) may also lead to high variance of anomaly scores. I wonder if there are any theoretical or intuitive explanations about this issue.\n\n- The authors use CutDiff and Rot for non-semantic and semantic shift detection respectively. But I would like to know could ST-SSAD learn zero-angle Rot for non-semantic defects and zero-size CutDiff for semantic shifts in end-to-end optimization when using both augmentations together.\n\n- The term ``Ratio invariance\u2019\u2019 may be imprecise. With the augmentation quantity changed, $L_{val}$ could be changed together because the included $\\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{{\\Vert {Z}^{c}\\Vert}_{F}}$ is different (I notice that this have no negative impact on optimization target).\n\n- There are some writing issues, *e.g.* superscript $^{n}$ should be $^{a}$ in **Lemma 2**."

The tuning result will be overly sensitive to the specific anomaly types in the test data and may not generalize well. The paper lacks clarification, experimental results, or in-depth discussion on this issue, which significantly limits the applicability and advantages of the proposed method.    \n\n- The mean distance loss is proposed for ratio invariance with theoretical properties, but no experimental result validating this invariance is provided. \n\n- The method still requires prior knowledge about anomalies and heavily depends on it. For example, the augmentation functions of either local (CutDiff) or global (rotation) augmentations are considered and therefore, it works well only when anomalies closely resemble specific shapes that these functions can reflect. The method will also fail in the case where rotated samples are considered normal. \n\n- The authors state that 'we focus on the performance of each anomaly type rather than overall accuracy.' However, in real-world scenarios, it is common to encounter various types of anomalies. Therefore, it will be more crucial to investigate such practical scenarios. \n\n- It was mentioned that \"there are no direct competitors on end-to-end augmentation hyperparameter tuning...\"; however, it is essential to include performance comparison with the latest models that clearly distinguish train and test data. The results in Tables 1 and 2 appear to be more like an ablation study, so it is difficult to assess whether the proposed method truly outperforms the latest models in a meaningful way."
