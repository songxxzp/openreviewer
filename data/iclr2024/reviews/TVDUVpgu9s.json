While the three examples presented in the main paper exhibit some improvements over the baseline model, looking at additional examples in the appendix the improvements are harder to assess. Typically for image generation, some kind of human evaluation is necessary to provide a more objective evaluation.\n\n2. Similarly, the reinforcement learning experiment compares only with a single baseline method (CMA-ES), which is not designed for RL. I think comparing with more RL-focused baselines such as [1] and [2] is more appropriate. \n\n[1]: Lee, Kimin, Laura M.

Towards the end of section 3.1 on how to choose $\\mu$ in Algorithm 1, can the authors expand on how to choose $\\mu$ in practice, for example in the stable diffusion experiment?\n\n2. It is not clear how the line search budget is accounted for in Section 4.1. Is it the case that, with $m=15$ queries, gradient-based algorithms will use 10 queries to estimate $g_t$ and the final 5 queries are used for the line search?\n\n3. Section 4.1 on investigating the impact of $m$ and $k$: Equation (10) seems to be dominated by $M_1(f, \\mu)$ when $k$ and $m$ are of relatively large values. That means that the second variance is actually not the dominant quantity. Please let me know if my understanding is correct.\n\n4. In section 4.2, the authors should compare with recent preference-based RL algorithms mentioned above. Additionally, it would be useful to include achieved rewards for standard RL algorithms with scalar rewards to show the performance gap (if any) using preference-based rewards."

Empirically, this paper also shows that ZO-RankSGD performs competitively to ZO-SGD (where the algorithm can query the function value).

Since most of the prior works assume a stochastic oracle, this setting needs to be further justified.\n-\tThere is no rigorous quantitative results in real-world applications (i.e., the diffusion model).

Also, the authors suggest furture direction for extending the algorithm to handle the aforementioned scenarios, however, they don't have any empirical results to support the claim. I would suggest the authors to provide at least some preliminary results for coroborate the argument.\n\n- Narrow focus: the authors only focused on image generation with human feedback, which is also a bit limited. For human feedbacks, it's more commonly used in tuning language models, though there are recent works start to explore how can we incoporate human feedbacks into improving diffusion models. The method itself is interesting, and it would be a great add if the authors can show that the method is also effective for tuning language models.\n\n\n--- \nPost rebuttal: thanks to the authors response.
