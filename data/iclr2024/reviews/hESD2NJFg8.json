Three modules, including difficulty-aware active node selection, confidence-aware annotations, and post-filtering are proposed to tackle the challenges.

It combines active learning (selection) techniques along with a difficulty score which is based on the distance from the center of a cluster. In the second step, annotations are created for the selected nodes using an LLM which also generates a confidence score. In the third step, nodes are pruned such that the confidence score of LLMs is high without significantly changing the diversity of nodes (via change in entropy). Finally, a GNN is trained on the graph to generate labels for other nodes."

Hence, difficulty aware selection i.e. use of c-density might not always help and, in fact, it may hinder in some cases. This is also evident from the results shown in Table 2 : Active_Selection_Methods and the corresponding  DA-Active_Selection_Methods show similar performance on average across different techniques (i.e., selection methods). Moreover, for at least 50% of the cases, the DA-method (row 2) performs poorly compared to the corresponding active learning method (row 1). \n\n- Though the accuracy from the LLM-GNN model is good (and of course, the model is efficient), it couldn't outperform LLM as a predictor (Table 3).\n\n- The methods are heuristics and do not have theoretical evidence."

I acknowledge that tuning was not performed, but there are still too many cases where performance declines. While the authors said that grid search would improve the performance in a specific case, it seems necessary to perform more tuning across a broader range of cases to clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of DA.\n- In Table 6, is it realistic to use labels in 1-shot example when we are considering the \"Label-free\" setting? Furthermore, how are the confidence scores determined in that example? More detailed explanation is required.\n- In Figure 4, why do some methods show an increase in performance after a budget of 70, followed by a sharp decline? Could this be attributed to class-imbalance issues during the selection process?\n- While there is an example in Figure 5, it would be beneficial to demonstrate on different datasets that LLM-GNN achieves competitive performance with GNNs trained on ground truth labeled data, while significantly reducing costs."
