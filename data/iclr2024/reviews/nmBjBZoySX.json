                "value": "This paper argues that existing graph lottery ticket algorithms like UGS heavily rely on trial-and-error pruning rate tuning and scheduling, and suffer from stability issues when extended to deeper GCNs. Those limitations call for an adaptive framework to automatically identify the pruning hyper-parameters that improve the scalability of GCNs. To this end, the authors propose a framework called AdaGLT, adaptive graph lottery tickets, to overcome such limitations.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed AdaGLT as compared to previous ad-hoc UGS."

As compared to previous UGS, the proposed AdaGLT jointly sparsifies both graphs and GNN weights and adopts an adaptive layer sparsification process. In addition, it offers the practitioner the chance to adopt automatic pruning and dynamic restoration for extracting the graph lottery tickets.\n\n2. The effective combination of automation, layer adaptivity, and dynamic pruning/restoration provides better properties as compared to previous methods."

The ogbn-arxiv is a small graph and ogbn-protein is a medium graph actually but are claimed as large graphs, more reasonablely large graphs should be considered. Also, how about inductive settings like GraphSAGE or other SOTA ones?\n\nOther than the above aspects, I think the other perspectives of this paper are clear."

The introduction of an edge explainer into GNN pruning that ensures interpretability during the pruning process while reducing unimportant edges, is a good way to mitigate the quadratic increase in parameters.\n3. Appendix is rich. I will recommend the authors move some large-scale experiments on OGBN-Arxiv and Products to be moved to main draft."

I appreciate the authors for their extensive experiments, but the role/importance of individual modules is not well explained. How does removing some components affect the performance. Another question, no significant performance benefit is observed for low sparsity ratios eg 30-50%. Any explanation of why it is effective only in high sparsity ratios will improve the manuscripts. I am open to increasing my score after the rebuttal discussion."
