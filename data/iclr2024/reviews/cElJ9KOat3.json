                "value": "This paper introduces a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach designed to train multiple coordinated agents, taking into account the constraints of directed acyclic graphs (DAG). The highlighted features of this solution include: \n\n1. From a computational standpoint, the authors leverage the inherent properties of DAG structures to enhance the solution's efficiency. This is realized by introducing innovative concepts such as the leader agent, reward generator, and distributor agent. These elements guide the subordinate follower agents in a more targeted exploration of the parameter space in environments governed by DAG constraints.\n \n2. On a theoretical level, the proposed solution serves as a lower bound for the optimal value function. This is made possible by incorporating a surrogate value function supplemented with synthetic rewards. \n\nFurthermore, the authors validate the efficacy of their method on four distinct DAG environments, underscoring its advantages in comparison to non-DAG strategies."

While I recognize that problems with multiple subtasks are important for multi-agent coordination, it's not clearly conveyed why these specifically fall under multi-agent reinforcement learning or what challenges they present. Given that the work's contribution is centered on the DAG structure, it might be beneficial for the authors to use an illustrative example for a clearer understanding.\n\n- In line with the above point, I find it somewhat challenging to connect the proposed solution with the problem described. For instance, the leader is trained to generate goal vectors for followers, but how does this align with the DAG constraint of the problem? How can we determine that a proposed goal-vector results in \"better coordination\"? A clearer outline of the challenges and more detailed motivations for the solution would be helpful."

Is it possible to directly derive the optimal value function for the DAG? If not, what impediments exist in directly computing this function? Might it be feasible in a more simple setup, such as in a tabular setting?\n\n3. The proposed approach maintains \"abstract\" messages between the leader agent and its followers. Why this level of abstraction? Could this characteristic of non-interpretability pose challenges to the method's practical application?\n\n4. With respect to the synthetic reward, how is an agent's contribution to the team reward assessed quantitatively? If a particular subtask significantly influences the coordination task but has several preceding subtasks, are these ancestors also assigned with high synthetic rewards?\n\n5. The study appears to incorporate several assumptions:\na)\tIn P3: \u201cthe team reward is the sum of the rewards obtained from sinks\u201d\nb)\tIn P4: \u201cthere can be a function $f_{ik}$ that measures the contribution of agent $i$ to sink agent $k$\u2019s reward and \u2026\u201d\nc)\tIn P6: \u201cthe synthetic reward for the follower $i$ is determined based on its contributions to the sink followers among its descendants\u201d\n\nDo these assumptions still hold in real-world scenarios? Might they limit the broader applicability of the proposed method? A more in-depth discussion on this matter would be appreciated."
