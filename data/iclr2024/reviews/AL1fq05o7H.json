The paper presents a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, avoiding materializing the expanded state to reduce memory usage. This results in faster computation than previous methods.\n\nThe paper simplifies prior deep sequence model architectures into a homogeneous architecture which is called as Mamba, incorporating the selective SSMs. Mamba enjoys fast inference, linear scaling, and improved performance on long sequences.\n\nIn the results the authors show that  Mamba achieves state of the art on synthetic tasks, audio/genomics modeling, and language modeling and outperforms Transformers of the same size on language modeling in both pretraining and downstream tasks.\n\nThe results suggest selective SSMs and the Mamba architecture could be a strong candidate for a general sequence model backbone for foundation models across modalities.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Concerns about model design:\n\n* The motivation of Mamba is to address the drawbacks of recurrent models while improving the efficiency of attention-based models. There are many works following the same direction: S4-diagonal [1], SGConv [2], MEGA [3], SPADE [4], and many efficient Transformer models (e.g., [5]). All of these models achieve near linear complexity, and the authors need to compare Mamba with these works in terms of both model performance and efficiency. For model performance, some simple experiments such as language modeling on Wikitext-103 should suffice.\n\n* Many attention-based Transformer models show length generalization ability, i.e., models can be trained on a shorter sequence length and tested on a longer sequence length. Some examples include relative positional encoding (T5) and Alibi [6]. Because SSMs are in general sequential, does Mamba have this length generalization ability?\n\n\nConcerns about experiments:\n\n* The authors need to compare with stronger baselines. The authors acknowledge that H3 was used as a motivation for the model architecture. However, they did not compare with H3 in the experiments. From Table 4 in [7], ppl of H3 is 8.8 (125M), 7.1 (355M), and 6.0 (1.3B) on the Pile dataset, which are considerably better than Mamba. The authors need to show comparisons with H3.\n\n* For the pre-trained models, the authors only show results on zero-shot inference. This setting is quite limited and the results cannot support the effectiveness of Mamba well. I suggest the authors run more long-sequence experiments such as document summarization, where the input sequence is naturally long (e.g., the average sequence length of the arXiv dataset is greater than 8k).\n\n* One of the main contributions that the authors claim is long sequence modeling. The authors should compare with more baselines on LRA (Long Range Arena), which is essentially the standard benchmark for long sequence understanding.\n\n* Memory benchmarking is missing. Even though Section 4.5 is titled \u201cspeed and memory benchmark\u201d, only speed comparisons are presented. Also, the authors should provide more detailed setups of Figure 8 left, e.g., model layers, model sizes, details of the convolution, etc. Could the authors provide some intuitions why FlashAttention is the slowest when the sequence length is very large (Figure 8 left)?\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14343.pdf \\\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.09298.pdf \\\n[3] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10655.pdf \\\n[4] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08136.pdf \\\n[5] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10447.pdf \\\n[6] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12409.pdf \\\n[7] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.14052.pdf"
