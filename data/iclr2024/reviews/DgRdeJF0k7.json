                "value": "1. Typically, in semi-supervised learning, it's important to maintain consistency in the employed backbone model for a fair evaluation of different strategies. In this paper, the authors utilized a CNN+Transformer encoder to extract feature representations from time series data, while the baseline methods relied on a four-layer convolutional neural network as their encoder. This discrepancy in backbone architectures raises fairness concerns in the comparison.\n\n2.  The concept of the dual-temporal encoder introduced in this paper lacks novelty. The utilization of a CNN+Transformer encoder for time series feature extraction was previously observed in TS-TCC [R1, R2], which has also been employed for semi-supervised learning of time series data.\n\n3. The relation-preserving loss introduced in this paper shares commonalities with SemiTime [R3]. Both approaches employ binary cross-entropy loss to capture temporal dependencies within time series data. However, the distinction lies in the fact that SemiTime constructs the loss function using two subsequences from the time series, whereas the approach in this paper constructs the loss function using the outputs from a CNN encoder and a Transformer encoder.\n\n4. Some graphs, like Figures 1&6, are too small in size to distinguish different classes.\n\n5. The number of UCR time series datasets utilized for the experiments in this study needs expansion. The creator of the UCR archive [R4], including 128 time series datasets, recommends comprehensive testing and publication of results on all datasets to prevent biased selection unless specific data types are targeted (e.g., classifying short time series). In the context of semi-supervised time series classification, guidelines include not using datasets where the number of instances in the training/validation/test set is smaller than the size of its class labels [R5] and ensuring each category comprises a minimum of 30 samples on average [R6]. Consequently, this study evaluates results on 100 UCR datasets in adherence to [R5], and for [R6], 106 datasets out of the original 128 UCR datasets are utilized for experimental evaluation.\n\n[R1] Time-series representation learning via temporal and contextual contrasting.

Why should all baselines use data augmentation? Data augmentation represents merely one facet of semi-supervised learning strategies. If the method presented in this paper were to incorporate the aforementioned data augmentation technique, it would lead to an unfair comparison in experimental outcomes. This is because the primary focus of this study does not centre on data augmentation methods.\n\n2. Setting masking ratio to random seems to be doubtful, the ablation experiment only contains the masking ratio of 0.5.\n\n3. See the above weaknesses."
