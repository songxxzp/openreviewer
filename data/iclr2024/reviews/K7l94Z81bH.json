                "value": "The paper proposed an algorithm (named RLD3) for solving Designated Driver Dispatch problem. The authors pointed out 3 challenges for this problem:\n- data sparsity, i.e. number of designated drivers is considerably smaller than taxi drivers\n- sparsity in reward, i.e. designated drivers only get reward once they are matched with an order\n- difficulty in modeling cross-interaction effects, i.e. how driver A's behavior affects driver B, and their long-term impact on the agents' reward. \n- hub-and-spoke issue, i.e. orders are concentrated in certain hotspots in the city, whereas the destinations are scattered. This results in long idle time of the driver after completing an order.\n \nThe paper framed the Designated Driver Dispatch problem as a decentralized partially observable markov decision process and proposed an actor-critic styled DRL solution. The authors proposed 3 ideas to tackle aforementioned challenges. \n\n- Group sharing. This idea is to group agents into subgroups, members in the subgroup shares parameter weights (of the corresponding actor network) and experience\n- Space potential. The idea is to mitigate the sparse reward issue by adding a prior to the reward based on the expected reward (computed from the available orders) in a region.  \n- Window lasting. The idea is to model agent-agent interaction by average actions over a time window. This is to mitigate the sparse and long term cross-interaction effect."

Why not train on a larger amount of data?\n\nSome formulations are not clear:\n\nIn Eq.
