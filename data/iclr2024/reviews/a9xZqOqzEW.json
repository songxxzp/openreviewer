The idea is as\nfollows: given a dataset, one can compute the ratio of discrepancy between the\nexpected outcomes and actual outcomes reported by the model. If one\nadditionally measures similarity between various entities in the dataset, such\ndiscrepancy observed for similar entities gives us an indication that a bias\nis present. The authors claim a few theoretical results and propose an\nalgorithm that computes the \"degree of bias\" and evaluate their ideas\nexperimentally. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is\ncomputationally more efficient than confusion matrices."

I mean computing the discrepancy\n  ratio between the actual outputs of the model and what is expected based on\n  the dataset and our (heuristic) similarity measure seems rather\n  straightforward to me.\n\n- The paper does not argue why this measure of fairness is valuable. For\n  instance, it is unclear to me what happens in the case when a dataset we\n  start from is biased on its own. There should be a way to alleviate this by\n  sacrificing model accuracy but the authors do not discuss this nor they say\n  how data bias affects their fairness measure.\n\n- The paper fails to relate with the state of the art in fairness analysis,\n  inclding previous works on the use of logic.

                "value": "This paper proposes a novel framework for visualizing and verifying the fairness of AI using spider diagrams.\n\nUnfortunately, I was not able to understand some very crucial and important aspects of the paper despite several attempts. This is not helped by several typos and grammatical errors, including using the singular form where perhaps the authors meant to use the plural form, making it very confusing to read. I found myself constantly trying to guess what the authors mean to say. I am happy to revise my review if the authors can help clarify things. I will try my best to state how I interpreted the paper, in the hope that the authors can jump in and help clarify if I get something wrong. \n\nThe authors consider a setting where we are given a dataset D. Each instance in the dataset has an actual label belonging to the set A. An AI model M (a function) maps each instance to a label, where the expected label for an instance belongs to the set E. The instances in D, together with their actual and expected labels are used to create a spider diagram. Each spider represents an instance. My understanding is that for each instance i, there is a spider, and the feet of the spider represent its actual or expected label, with a tie connecting the feet for the same instance. Now, if an instance i has a foot in the intersection of A and E, it means M correctly labels instance i. The degree of bias of M is described by comparing across the different classes (e.g. of a protected attribute) the frequencies of spiders (corresponding to instances of each class) that do not have a foot in the intersection of the sets E and A in the spider diagram.\n\nOverall, I think the paper would benefit greatly from the addition of simple toy examples to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework. I suggest adding an example of a binary classification task, with a dataset D with a small number of instances, with the actual labels, a simple biased model, and expected labels described clearly, and showing step by step how the spider diagram helps illustrate the bias of the model."

I will try to list them as they are encountered while reading the paper from the beginning.\n- In the abstract, it is not clear what is meant by actual outcome and expected outcome. Specifically, the phrases used are \"actual outcome of the algorithm\" and \"expected outcome of the model\". Is the actual outcome determined by an algorithm, or does it refer to some ground truth about the instance (say, determined by a target function)? It is actually not clear what is meant by model here. Is it a set of hypotheses, or is it a single hypothesis function? What is meant by expected outcome of the model? Does the model describe a probability distribution over possible labels? Or is it that depending on the available dataset (generated from some input distribution), a different function is learned? What is meant by algorithm and model here? How are they different? By model, do you mean the nearest-neighbor / similarity based method described in Section 2, Page 3?\n- I suggest changing the notation of the set of expected outcomes, as \\mathbb{E} is typically used to represent the expected value of a random variable.\n- Page 2, para 2: \"compares the set of expected outcome E to the set of actual outcome A\". Do you mean to use the singular or plural here? e.g. set of expected outcomes. In a binary classification task, what are E and A?\n- Page 2, Section 2: \"two groups of output\"? Do you mean protected attribute values? Typically the output refers to the predicted label. What am I missing?\n- Page 3, para 1: \"protected groups are advantaged ...\" Is this an assumption, or a requirement? It is not clear what is meant here.\n- Page 3, para 2: \"generator\": Is denoted by p, but then does not appear in Eq. (1). Is Q_1 the same as p? The sensitive attribute is denoted s, but then is not mentioned or discussed later in the paper.\n- There is also a claim here: \"If two entities Q_1 and Q_i are similar, the expected outcome of both ... should be classified into the same class label depending on the class of Q_1\" This reads like a very strong assumption about the problem setting. Consider e.g. the setting where there is a single integer attribute, and all instances with odd value for the attribute have ground truth label 0 and all even instances have ground truth label 1. How do we handle such a problem?\n- In Eq. (1), what does 'n' refer to? Earlier, 'n' was used as a variable to index the instances. Here, its use seems different.\n- What is the threshold for deciding whether the similarity between Q_1 and Q_i is sufficient to assign Q_i the same label as Q_1?\n- Page 3, last 2 lines: \"each closed curve is used to represent sets\": Do you mean multiple sets or a single set? If multiple, how to intepret this statement?\n- I did not find the discussion of Section 2.1 to be helpful. Referring back to the original papers by Howse et al. helped clarify some things, and I can see how spider diagrams are useful for logical reasoning, but I am unable to completely understand its use in evaluating an AI model. An example that builds from a toy AI problem with a small dataset and a simple biased model would be greatly appreciated.\n- Definition 1. Do you mean to say for each expected label e_i, there exists an actual label a_i, such that e_i = a_i? Could you illustrate how this works using the example of a binary classification problem? Can an instance i have multiple expected and actual labels? Is it possible for an instance to have an expected label but no actual label or vice-versa?\n- With a few assumptions, I can possibly see how in Section 3, the proposed algorithm can be used to compute the degree of bias. However, it would help to clarify the presentation and provide a running example to remove any ambiguities.\n- Figure 3 could be used to show the actual spider diagrams in addition to the bar plots."
