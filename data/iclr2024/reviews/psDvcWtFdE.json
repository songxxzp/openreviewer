The authors first prove the boundedness and feasibility when generating instances using the dual formation, which ensures the correctness of the proposed generator DIG-MILP. In the training step, DIG-MILP continues to mask a random node and the connections to it, and use the incomplete instance as input to the VAE, aiming to reconstruct the instance. This task is suitable for VAE and helps the model to learn how to generate more MILP instances. The proposed method is well-designed and the proofs are sufficient. The experiments on multiple datasets and scenarios show the performance of the proposed method."

                "value": "1. In the pipeline of the proposed method, I see that one node will be removed and the origin G is changed to G'. I wonder if this one-node change is too small to identify. In common MILP datasets, the size of nodes/constraints is more than thousands, and for the industry area, the size is even larger. \n2. In section 3.2, the authors provide the feasibility guarantee for the proposed methods. But I am curious about unfeasible instances, can the proposed framework generate unfeasible MIP instances? In my view, it is okay when a MIP instance is infeasible and this situation is common in the real world.\n3. The metrics in the experiments are confusing to me. The authors mentioned: \"The similarity score is derived from the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence (the lower the better) between each metric of the generated and original data\", while in the caption of table 1 said: \"The similarity score \u2191 between the original and generated data.\" The similarity score is lower the better or higher the better? Actually, I wonder what we expect about the similarity score. I mean, more similarity could increase Authenticity while less similarity could increase Diversity. Both cases seem to mean something.\n4. About the datasets in the experiments, I see that for small datasets SC and CA the amount of instances is 1000, but for large datasets CVS and IIS the amount is less than 10. This gap looks very strange to me. Moreover, in, table 2, does training and testing on merely 3 instances lead to an overfitting to these instances? I think the datasets CVS and IIS need to be further refined. I understand that they are selected from MIPLIB17, but MIPLIB17 at least has hundreds of instances. If the MIPLIB17 is too hard, I think NeurIPS 2021 ML4CO[1] datasets could be more suitable.\n\n\n[1] Maxime Gasse, Simon Bowly, Quentin Cappart, Jonas Charfreitag, Laurent Charlin, Didier Ch\u00b4etelat, Antonia Chmiela, Justin Dumouchelle, Ambros Gleixner, Aleksandr M Kazachkov, et al.

The generative spectrum of DIG-MILP spans all feasible and bounded MILPs, endowing it with the prowess to produce a \"variety\" of instances. Experimental analyses underscore DIG-MILP's promise in: (S1) facilitating MILP data dissemination for solver hyperparameter optimization without publishing original datasets, and (S2) data enrichment to bolster the robustness of machine learning techniques dedicated to tackling MILPs."
