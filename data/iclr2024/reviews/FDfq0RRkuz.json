                "value": "# Evaluation\nMy main concern with this paper is with the choice of evaluation strategies.\n\nFirst:\n> To facilitate easy evaluations of the source attribution accuracy, for each data provider, we use the\nsentences selected for watermarking (after removing the watermarks) as the inputs/prompts to the\ntrained WASA-LLM, and use the watermarks embedded into the generated texts for source attribution. This simplifies the evaluations because the corresponding data provider of the input sentence is\nnaturally the ground-truth source.\n\nI am afraid this may be too close to \"evaluating on the training set\", and thus may significantly skew the reported results. In particular, at a minimum, I would like to see an evaluation on a \"held-out\" set of sentences from each data provider which were *not* selected for watermarking.\n\nSecond:\n>  This simplifies the evaluations because the corresponding data provider of the input sentence is\nnaturally the ground-truth source. [...] Specifically, we first select 50 sentences from each data provider\n[...] Next, we use the first 200 characters of every selected\nsentence (without watermarks) as the input/prompt to the trained WASA-LLM which then generates\nsynthetic texts (by continuing the sentence) with a token length of 100. The watermark embedded\ninto the generated sentence is then used for source attribution, i.e., the source attribution is correct if\nthis watermark matches the watermark of the data provider corresponding to this sentence.\n\nIt is not directly clear to me that the generated text prompted by a particular sentence from the training set is \"naturally\" generated from the same source. For example, I could imagine prompting an LLM to answer a particular fact (e.g., contained in Wikipedia), but structure my query in a way that maximizes TF-IDF with a document from e.g. ArXiv. Then, \"naturally\", the model should be using the Wikipedia source, not the ArXiv one, when completing the prompt.\n\n\nMinor concern:\n- The proposed watermarking framework cannot be applied to already trained models, i.e., it requires a specific intervention during training. This may significantly limit its applicability."

Presently, it appears that the authors have included an extensive amount of information that they find interesting or significant for the readers. While this enthusiasm is commendable, it can make it challenging for readers to grasp the central idea at the outset.\n\nSpecifically, the methodology section poses a notable challenge as it lacks clarity in explaining how the method functions and what the underlying threat model is. This confusion arises from the authors blending their method with background information, and the threat model is informally introduced in the paper's introduction. It is important to emphasize that I am not suggesting a strict adherence to a standard layout, but rather, a reorganization of the paper's structure that would enhance the communication of the core concepts to the readers.\n\n**Watermark can be easily removed**\n\nFurthermore, there is a concern regarding the effectiveness of the watermark method proposed in the paper. The authors utilize invisible characters within sentences to maintain the imperceptibility of the watermark. However, it seems evident that a straightforward defense strategy would involve the removal of all invisible characters, rendering the watermark entirely ineffective.\n\n**Questionable threat model**\n\nAdditionally, a related concern pertains to the use of these invisible characters. The authors appear to increase the vocabulary size to accommodate these rare characters. This raises the question of whether the insertion of a watermark requires manipulation of the tokenizer used by the target language model."
