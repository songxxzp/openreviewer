                "value": "It seems there is confusion about some fundamental concepts and there are some pitfalls with the proposed approach. Specifically, for each task, the model lies in some (sub)space. In the literature, the orthogonal projection method is proposed to update the model weights and learn the model for each task accordingly. This paper proposed gradient space, which  does not make much sense. Gradient descent is used to update weights in the model space, so what does gradient space refer to?  The gradient in each step is computed using input data and is stochastic; so would gradient space would be random? \n\nThis paper claims the proposed weight orthogonal method can eliminate catastrophic forgetting completely; this is overly ambitious.\nFor instance, when backward knowledge transfer takes place, it would change the weights for previous tasks. How to ensure the weight orthogonality all the way?\n\nSome more detailed comments:\n\n1. For Theorem 1, it\u2019s not  clear why prior OG-based methods cannot guarantee zero CF.  What if the modified weights spanned by the orthogonal gradient to the previously learned tasks  happen on the whole weight space, instead of its own weight subspace? \n2. The proposed STIL seems complex: It has two steps for learning each new task with four steps to calculate the similarity between tasks.  Thus the memory and time cost need to be justified. For example,  since the proposed STIL adopts GPM method to obtain knowledge bases with additional computation and memory cost (e.g., data replay), why the proposed STIL can have less time and memory compared to GPM for some datasets (e.g., CIFAR100 Sup, 5-dataset as shown in Table 6)?  How do the authors define memory in this work? Does it include both stored bases and replay data? \n3. The experimental results compared to CUBER need to be justified.  As shown in Table.1, compared to CUBER, STIL shows better accuracy but higher forgetting which is inconsistent with the claims. \n4. The proposed method seems only can be used to Task-incremental learning. How about class-incremental learning?"

However, it cannot guarantee to explain the property of catastrophic forgetting in the final logit layer of DNN, which is directly connected to the output prediciton.\n- The proposed $\\mathcal{L}_{sim}$ is based on the constrained optimization, which cannot be applied to the nonconvex domain (most deep learning probelms) directly. In addition, the orthogonality of weight matrix cannot explain the orthogonality of the hidden layers with non-linear activation, so I think the author should provide more empirical evidence why this proposed loss facilitate knowldedge transfer.\n- The similarity detection based algorithm seems not novel enough to explain the task distribution distance by measuring on the online data stream. The threshold $\\theta$ is too heuristic without any empirical explanation.\n\nI think that this paper is a simple combination of the existing gradient projection memory method and the heuristic similiarity based update rule.\n\nUpdating scheme among orthogonal weight subspaces can be a interesting work, but this paper does not theoretically or empirically provides what happens in the non-linear activation layer.\n\nFurthermore, the proposed method should have acheived the best performance in the both metrics, test accuracy and BWT simultaneously if the propsed pipeline succesfully works to handle catastrophic forgetting and knowledge transfer simultaneously.\n\n## Miscelleaous\n\nThe main idea section is not well written and easy to follow.\n\nFirst of all, some main statement is not clear as follows:\n\n- In Equation (1), the subscription of the weight matrix is the task, so it does not fit the SGD update definition which is on the time-step.\n- The main terminology, OWIS is not explained in the paper including supplementary materials.\n- The pipeline figure and the pseudocode are in supplementary material, so it is hard to understand how the proposed algorithm works.\n- There are two many aabrevation and terminology without enough explanation such as knowledge base in page 5.\n- I think this method is the extension fo GPM, but the discussion on the comparision in the experimental section is not enough. For example, why STIL without OIWS  slightly performs better than GPM."
