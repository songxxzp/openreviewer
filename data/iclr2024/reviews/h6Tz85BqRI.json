Existing knowledge distillation methods for graph-structured data exploit labels of each node for the knowledge distillation. But, the number of labeled nodes is limited so that the class space may not be sufficient to cover the diverse graph structures. To address this issue, the paper proposes a variant of VQ-VAE to directly label the local graph structures. Specifically, it first learns a structure-aware tokenizer for dealing with graph structured datsets. The structure-aware tokenizer encodes the local substructure of each node as a discrete code. Then, the paper designs a new distillation target to directly transfer the structural knowledge of each node from GNN to MLP."

Then, I think that learning representations with self-supervised learning [1] for graphs can be other option to capture local graph structure. In my thoughts, labeling nodes' local structure with discrete codes seems not different from learning node representation with self-supervision loss [1] if its purpose is capturing local structure.\n\n[1]: Veli\u010dkovi\u0107, Petar, et al. \"Deep graph infomax.\" ICLR 2019."

I am somehow confused, since it is about GNNs-to-MLPs KD, better capturing the local structure information is an issue for GNNs part, instead of KD?\n    - It is better to explain more about why it is appropriate to use VQ-VAE to encode graph structure, since it was originally designed for continuous data. For graph-structured data, it might be easier to convert to frequency information, i.e., each position in the \"codebook\" stores the volume of a specific frequency. I am just curious why VQ-VAE is suitable for encoding discrete and non-Euclidean data.\n    - According to the inner product in the reconstruction loss of equation 3 and the benchmarks used, it is quite important to emphasize that the effective domain of the proposal is probably homophilic graphs, otherwise further discussion or experiments on heterophilic graphs are necessary.\n\n- Minor\n    - What is the data set used for Figure 1? Cora? All other figures/tables need further clarification on which dataset is used.\n    - In equation 3, the node embeddings are still included, so the claimed local structural embedding is not that promising, can you compare or explain the difference of the two parts of the reconstruction function? Also, what's the nonlinear function here?\n    - Figure 2 needs improvement- In equation 7, the loss of classification and class distillation should also be clarified.\n    - The codebook does not seem to be so different from VGAE from the point of view of structure reconstruction, but the node feature reconstruction part makes it so different. Also, the graph structure part is not well designed, but an inner product.\n    - In the figures and descriptions throughout the paper, it is not fair to say that the codebook really preserves the structural information as a substructure, since it is just another integrated embedding where the identifiability of specific structure is missing, therefore it is misleading to give the local structure in Figure 2.\n    - An interesting point, which is worth to study further, is what the Figure 5(ii) implies: denser graph needs more space, which is parallel to the discovery from graph signal processing domain, that the structural information cannot be summarized only by some low-frequency filters, the high-frequency ones are also informative in such graphs."

                "value": "This paper proposes a GNN-to-MLP distillation approach. During the teacher GNN training, a series of code embeddings are jointly optimized using a reconstruction loss, to make them encode local graph structures. The divergence between the soft code assignment of the teacher GNN and that of the student MLP is used as additional supervision for distillation. The proposed approach outperforms the teacher GNN and other existing GNN-to-MLP distillation methods in both transductive and inductive settings."

                "value": "- Some details of the experimental setup are not clear enough to me. As far as I understand from the paper, in the inductive setting,  $G^L \\cup G^U_{obs}$ is used for training the teacher GNN and for distillation. True labels $Y^L$ are used to train the teacher but are not used in distillation. Is it right? The paper mentions that \"the edges between $G^L \\cup G^U_{obs}$ and $G^U_{ind}$ are removed in training, while they are leveraged during inference to transfer positional features via average operator\". What does this mean? Do you augment the node feature with the features of its neighbors for inference?\n- What the student MLP can learn from distillation is ambiguous. Suppose two nodes have the same private feature but different neighborhoods, the teacher GNN would generate different representations and different soft code assignments for these two nodes. However, in distillation, the student MLP would always generate the same representation and soft code assignment for these two nodes (since they have the same private feature). As a result, the student MLP cannot learn their structural difference from the teacher"
