This allows applying deep learning image models to analyze the sequences. The authors mention that existing/traditional methods convert sequences into numerical features or use Chaos Game Representation (CGR) to create images. But these have limitations like sparsity, high dimensionality, poor representation of sequence information in images.\n\nThe proposed method maps each element (amino acid, nucleotide) of a sequence onto a Bezier curve to create an image. Multiple points on the curve represent each element. This captures more information and patterns in the image compared to traditional CGR-based methods where elements map to fixed pixels. Experiments on three protein datasets for classification tasks show the Bezier method outperforms baselines like FCGR and RandomCGR images, and numerical embedding methods.\n\nIn the results, the authors demonstrate that for subcellular protein localization dataset, Bezier images achieve 40% higher accuracy than FCGR using CNNs. Furthermore, cluster visualization and histograms also show Bezier embeddings preserve structure better. Overall, the paper demonstrates biological sequence analysis benefits from transforming sequences into images via Bezier curves before applying deep learning models."
