                "value": "This paper considers the problem of learning neural approximations of multi-valued input solution mappings arising from solutions of non-convex optimization problems. Previous work on learning single-valued mappings struggled to approximate such multi-valued mappings, compromising between poor optimality performance and high computational complexity. This paper proposes a generative approach based on rectified flows, which is inspired by the recent successes of generative models for modeling complex multi-modal distributions. \n\nThe authors propose to process multiple samples in parallel, project them onto the feasible region, and keep only the best one, leading to high quality feasible samples.\nThis is also quantified in a theorem, which gives an upper bound on the probability of selecting a sample that has optimality gap larger than $\\delta$, elucidating the dependence of sample quality on the dataset quality, the approximation error of the learned vector field, the number of ODE discretization steps and the number of samples. Additionally the runtime complexity is characterized, giving insights into the tradeoff between increasing the number of samples and increasing the number of ODE discretization steps.\nExperimentally, the proposed approach is compared to various baseline on a synthetic multi-valued dataset and three graph-based combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed approach is shown to strongly outperform previous neural-network based approaches in terms of optimality gap while preserving a strong speedup in runtime."

More complex problems with multiple constraints can be added to enhance the experimental part.\n2) Many generative models are designed for optimization problems. Despite the comparison with basic generative models, the generative models for optimization problems should be compared. A lot of them learn solution distributions rather than single-valued mappings, which share the same motivation in this paper. I believe they can be easily used in the tested problems in this paper. Please refer to A GNN-guided predict-and-search framework for mixed-integer linear programming, DIFUSCO: Graph-based Diffusion Solvers for Combinatorial Optimization, SurCo: Learning Linear Surrogates For Combinatorial Nonlinear Optimization Problems\n3) The method is too straightforward by applying RectFlow, lowering the novelty of this work.

The authors claim \"existing studies endeavor to identify a single possible mapping from the potential multiples\". It is not totally correct as considerable research focuses on estimating solution distributions given instances and many diversity techniques are adopted to encourage models finding more near-optimal solutions. \n4.
