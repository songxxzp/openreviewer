I understand the author shape this paper as the one of the first to explore diffusion in a multi-task learning setting. But at the same time, I saw some other papers also using the multi-task learning technique in diffusion to enforce geometric constrains, particularly in the 3d shape synthesis.  For example, Wonder3D (https://www.xxlong.site/Wonder3D/) and DreamCraft3D (https://mrtornado24.github.io/DreamCraft3D/) are two examples applying diffusion on both RGB and normal maps to improve multi-view/geometric consistency. I am aware both papers were released very recently and seem to be submitted to ICLR as well, I am just wondering how the proposed paper differentiates itself from the straightforward implementation of using multi-task learning in diffusion like bering used in these two papers, and from which both were based on the same assumption of using shared diffusion space as well?\n2.\tAs such, I am not exactly sure how to comment and understand the performance of the proposed formulation, since the experiment setting is simple and only compare with simple single task baseline. For example, it might be more intriguing to see i) the performance / formulation without having a shared diffusion space, ii) how to compare with multi-task predictive models without any diffusion (e.g. MTAN, Adasahre, Cross-Stitch, PadNet, as multi-task learning in computer vision is an active research area.), iii) is task conflict issue in multi-task learning alleviated? What are the other benefits other than improved performance?"

The proposed Multi-Task Diffusion Model (MT-Diffusion) is capable of generating multi-type data (e.g., images and their corresponding labels) within a single unified model. It integrates multi-task learning losses into the diffusion process, supported by a theoretical foundation. The authors propose and experiment with several multi-task generative settings, including image transition, masked-image training, joint image-label, and joint image-representation generation, demonstrating the framework's versatility and effectiveness on the ImageNet dataset. MT-Diffusion handles multiple data types through a shared diffusion space, with a forward process aggregating multi-task data and a reverse process using task-specific decoder heads to reconstruct data for different tasks. This approach results in a novel multi-task variational lower bound that generalizes the standard diffusion model, achieving simultaneous multi-task generation without compromising individual task performance."
