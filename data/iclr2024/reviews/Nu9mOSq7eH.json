In my opinion, this approach does not have clear advantages compared to simply performing these tasks in a multitask learning setting on T2I model.\n2.

However, in the paper titled \"InstructCV,\" it seems that the approach primarily identifies instructions as task indicators within a predefined set of tasks. This may not demonstrate an advantage over traditional multitask learning. Could the author provide further explanation regarding the unique advantages of this approach?\n2. I believe the good generation ability to new datasets is mostly because the comparison baselines lack the ability to handle open vocabulary. On the other hand, T2I  models are trained on a large amount of text-to-image pairs, which naturally gives them a good open vocabulary capability. Additionally, some unified models like x-decoder also demonstrate excellent generalization ability to new categories.\n\nIn summary, one aspect that concerns me is the lack of clear advantages in unifying dense prediction as an image-to-image generation task. The article mentions instruction tuning, but the experimental results do not generalize to new tasks. The open vocabulary capability is primarily attributed to the T2I models, and I don't believe this alone can be considered unique because The open vocabulary capability has also demonstrated impressive performance in previous works, such as xdecoder[1].\n\n[1] X-Decoder: Generalized Decoding for Pixel, Image and Language"

After reading the paper, I am a bit confused about the visually encoded outputs for different tasks.\na) Semantic segmentation: How to derive the mask of all semantic classes for an input image? If predicting them one by one and each class is manually indicated, I would say it is more like a task of referring segmentation rather than semantic segmentation. It would be helpful if the authors could provide more elaboration on this.\nb) Object detection: What do the authors mean by saying \u201ccross-reference the bounding boxes with the dataset annotations\u201d in Appendix A.3?\n\n2. What type of instructions is used during inference? Fixed templates or random rephrased ones? Does it remain the same for InstructCV-FP and InstructCV-RP during inference? As reported in Table 3, InstructCV-FP outperforms InstructCV-RP if both use template prompts during inference, so why bother training InstructCV using rephrased prompts? I understand this could improve the robustness of variations in wording, but one can just adopt a fixed template prompt to address a standard computer vision task. In addition, the rephrased prompts for each task are not that diverse (only 7 variations according to Table 4), why do we need to leverage LLMs as this could be readily done by humans? I would like to see more discussions about the benefits brought by utilizing rephrased prompts.\n\n3. More ablations should be conducted to compare InstructCV-FP with InstructCV-RP. For example, the authors could report the results of InstructCV-FP in Table 1.\n\n4. For the organization of this paper, I suggest the authors move the introduction of diffusion models in Section 2.2 (which takes up most of this section) to a \u201cPrerequisites\u201d subsection or Appendix.\n\n5. The proposed method claims to be a vision generalist but it is validated only in some visual recognition tasks. What about other vision tasks such as low-level tasks (e.g., denoise, deblur, and derain) and generation (as done in Prompt Diffusion [1*])?\n\n6. Further comparisons with other SOTA unified models such as Painter [2*] should be conducted. Painter is currently performing the best in prediction tasks as a vision generalist.\n\n7. In terms of the computational cost, the authors claim that InstructCV exhibits much faster inference speed than previous methods such as Unified-IO. However, InstructCV needs multiple inferences for some tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation and classification), which could consume N\u00d7times where N is the number of semantic classes. Besides, the reported inference time of InstructCV on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU for an image is 5 seconds in the main paper but 10 seconds in the Appendix.\n\n8. In the second paragraph of Section 1, the authors claim that \u201cHowever, these prompts consist of (uninterpretable) numerical values derived from specific training datasets, which may limit their ability to generalize to new datasets, tasks, or categories\u201d. Why do the prompts used in inpainting-based methods (which are visual examples) contain uninterpretable numerical values?\n\n9. The format of references is messy and inconsistent. For example, a bunch of references do not list the conference/journal title.\n\n10. Just a reminder that there is a very similar work, InstructDiffusion [3*], to this submission. The authors could consider citing that paper and provide comparisons and discussions.\n\n[1*] In-context learning unlocked for diffusion models. arXiv, 2023.\n\n[2*] Images speak in images: A generalist painter for in-context visual learning.
