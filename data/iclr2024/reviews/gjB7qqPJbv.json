This benchmark is accompanied by a platform, which contains necessary codes for TSELDF, ranging from pre-processing, forecasting models and post-processing. The benchmark notably demonstrates the importance of engineered features and appropriate loss function. The latter is important because a good ELD prediction is not necessarily the closest prediction to the ground truth, but one that take into consideration the cost.\n\nAuthors experimented their platform on 11 datasets and against various baselines on two scenarios: Probabilistic forecasting and point forecasting."

The question now is what is the novelty of Authors apart from compiling the techniques and models? I would expect from a benchmark paper to guide users on when to use specific engineered features or specific techniques depending on the dataset, the experiment setup, etc. And discuss more the results.\n\nIn addition, the dataset analysis could be further improved in order to better understand their differences and better comprehend reason why in some configuration a given models should be preferred to another one.\n\nMoreover, the Authors did not address the limitation of their paper such as missing latest SOTA transformers [1] or Linear models [2], applicability to other load forecasting dataset (What does building stand for here? Is it residential building, office or industrial? Or any. Time constraint and temperature importance will vary a lot depending on such information).\n\nDiscussion that could be started in the paper:\n * What is the reason for temperature to not perform well with DL models, is it because of the integration is too simplistic or is it inherent to the DL architecture? \n * How will the cost loss function will apply in a large-scale scenario? Or temperature?\n\nFinally, in my opinion the paper could be re-written in order to make content clearer and better convey the ideas.

For instance [3] [4] showed that human dynamics only affect ELD.\n\n> we will provide various related feature engineering in our package and discuss the impact on load forecasting models based on temperature feature engineering. \n\nAuthors only demonstrated temperature\u2026\n\n> Because the aggregated-level load results from multiple load aggregations, it typically exhibits more pronounced periodicity and seasonality\n\nProof? Authors could demonstrate this by plotting ACF of each dataset, providing them in appendix and showing the seasonality difference of each dataset.\n\n> Building-level loads change very dramatically, resulting in significant uncertainty \n\nIn my opinion, this sentence contradicts the previous one. Why would an aggregation of individual building level load that are very different will necessarily exhibits more pronounced periodicity? There is a scale parameter to take into consideration, no? \n\n## Suggestions\n### Fig 3: \nAuthors should provide the figures for the other datasets in appendix otherwise it might look like they exhibit only the advantageous results. In addition, for clearer understanding, use color to differentiate models (DL and non-DL models).

While the authors argue that this asymmetric loss function improves performance, its efficacy is inconsistent across datasets (e.g., GEF17 and Spain). A deeper explanation is needed regarding why it performs poorly on aggregated-level data like GEF17.\n\nLack of Theoretical Justification: The paper lacks a theoretical foundation that explains why the chosen custom loss function is more suitable than other potential loss functions (e.g., Huber loss, quantile loss).\n\nNon-Uniformity in Dataset Treatment: The paper applies temperature-based feature engineering uniformly across datasets without considering the nature of the data. For instance, the Covid19 dataset, which shows a decline in electrical load due to the pandemic, might require different treatment.\n\nOversimplification in Feature Engineering: The paper mentions the use of a single temperature series for multiple load series in GEF12. This oversimplification can lead to a loss of model expressiveness and performance degradation.\n\nIssues with Equations\nLack of Generalization: The mathematical equations for the custom loss function are limited to the application domain. A generalized mathematical model would add to the rigor of the research.\nWeaknesses in Diagrams and Graphs\nLimited Insight: Figures such as Figure 3 and Figure 4 provide limited insight into how the feature engineering process actually affects the model's performance. These figures could be enhanced by including confidence intervals or additional metrics.\n\nAmbiguity in Visualization: The visualizations of load data (e.g., Fig. 12, Fig. 13) lack details on statistical properties like skewness, kurtosis, which are critical in time-series data.\n\nBenchmarking and Comparative Analysis\n\nInconsistency in Metric Reporting: The paper reports performance in terms of Pinball Loss and cost but doesn't consider other widely-used metrics like RMSE or MAPE for a comprehensive evaluation.\n\nScalability and Efficiency:\n\nThe paper lacks an analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed methods.\nThere is no discussion on the scalability of the proposed model to larger datasets or more complex systems, which is crucial for real-world applications.\n\nConclusions and Future Directions\nLack of Rigor in Conclusions: The conclusions make broad claims about the utility and extensibility of the developed package but lack empirical or theoretical support for these claims.\n\nLimited Discussion on Model Robustness: The paper does not discuss the robustness of the proposed model in the face of data anomalies, missing data, and outliers, which are common in real-world applications."

Is it designed to handle large-scale data and is it optimized for computational efficiency?\n\nTemporal Consistency: The paper mentions the use of data from various years. How does the model handle the temporal inconsistencies, and how does this affect the model's generalizability over time?\n\nMiscellaneous\nClarification on Conclusions: The conclusions claim high extensibility and utility of the developed package.

However, the spatial aspect of the problem is completely missing from the paper. The authors have considered both individual and aggregated forecasting - but have not used the spatial information present in the dataset to improve the forecasting.\n\n2. In Section 1, \"Underestimating predictions at peak points...\" - It is not clear if the impact is different for over-estimating and under-estimating predictions during peak points? Intuitively, over-estimating during peak points implies that one has to increase the capacity of the power generation which can lead to significant cost for infrastructural changes. Similarly, under-estimating during peak points implies additional purchase of power during the high demand time which may again cost significantly if it happens frequently. This is also related to the demand response problem in smart grid. Please check: \"Siano, Pierluigi. \"Demand response and smart grids\u2014A survey.\" Renewable and sustainable energy reviews 30 (2014): 461-478\". \n\n3. The datasets used are not large in scale. UCI is the only dataset used where it has both a good number of series and length.\n\n4. In Section 5.1, text part just summarizes the observation in the tables containing the experimental results. However, the reasoning part is missing. For e.g., why do non-deep learning methods perform better than deep learning methods without temperature transformation strategy? Why do some DL methods perform better than other more complicated DL methods?\n\n5. The baseline algorithms used in the paper are very standard time series forecasting or DL algorithms. They are also easily available in many ML/DL packages. It is not clear why authors do not use any existing approaches customized for load forecasting? There are certainly approaches available in electrical load forecasting literature which are tailored for this task. That way the package can be more relevant for researchers working in the domain.\n\n6. Authors have not compared if \"aggregation followed by prediction\" or \"prediction followed by aggregation\" or some other type of strategy is preferred for aggregate level forecasting where the corresponding individual level power consumption series are available. Please check \"Bandyopadhyay, Sambaran, et al. \"Individual and aggregate electrical load forecasting: One for all and all for one.\" Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Sixth International Conference on Future Energy Systems. 2015\".\n\n7. Apart from the datasets and external factors used for this task, the paper looks very similar to any standard forecasting task. Is it possible to add more technical evidence to show how load forecasting is different from a standard time series forecasting problem with dependency on external variables?"
