This work intelligently identifies that prior methods such as EasyProject have the drawback of non-natural markers (e.g., BIO tokens) degrading translation quality. To counter this, CODEC instead uses an unconstrained translation as a template and proposes a constrained decoding algorithm to reconcile the template with the annotated input. \n\nThis changes the formula of EN to BAM from:\n```\nEN -> add markers -> MT -> BAM + markers\n```\nto:\n```\nEN -> BAM,    EN -> add markers -> [EN+markers, BAM] -> MT w/ constrained decoding -> BAM + markers\n```\nThis removes the issue of MT errors near annotation tokens and provides some reference to check approximate validity during CODEC. This work applies CODEC to both the translate-train and translate-test scenarios of cross-lingual transfer to identify that CODEC has benefits nearly everywhere we can use silver-standard data in cross-lingual transfer. Experiments on NER and event argument extraction identify how CODEC benefits cross-lingual transfer across a wide range of low-resource languages. Ablations and analysis across multiple languages are honest and interpretable in discussing where CODEC is beneficial and does not improve."

Overall, I think this paper absolutely should be accepted.\n\n- The improvement in both translate-train and translate-test scenarios identify the method as a strong new idea with wide applicabiility. Provided _some_ MT capability, this work helps mitigate the cross-lingual transfer gap to languages with very little study. The work smartly focuses on this scenario (i.e., through MasakhaNER) to support that CODEC works in (approx) the lowest resource scenarios available in modern NLP. \n\n- Succintely describing a constrained decoding method is not easy and this work smartly describes the method visually and mathematically for excellent clarity of the contribution. The frank discussion of complexity and the heuristic approximations for tractability are also honest with tradeoffs discussed in detail to inform future practice."

Different translators may have different behaviors to handle the markers. I suggest the authors to report the results of different translators to show the stability of the proposed method.\n- The proposed method is based on some heuristic. It would be great if the authors can provide some theoretical bound to justify the heuristic.\n- It seems like that they follow the experimental setting of previous work (Chen et al. 2023a). However, they consider MasakhaNER 2.0 rather than WikiAnn (reported by Chen et al. 2023a) for NER without any explanation. Is it because that the proposed method works better for low-resource languages? I suggest to report the scores on WikiAnn as well for more comprehensive comparisons.\n- I am a little bit confused by the reason for not considering translation-test for EAE. The authors mention that the English gold trigger is needed but not feasible. However, this can be obtained by applying the proposed constraint label project from the target language to English. It would be interesting to study more about this."

I still think that the method could have been evaluated on a larger selection of tasks, but this doesn't invalidate the soundness of the proposed methodology, and I'm happy to increase my score\n===========================\n\nThis paper targets cross-lingual transfer for sequence labeling task, where the main problem in previous work has been projecting labeled spans from the source language to the correct spans in the target language, a problem sometimes referred to as the labeled span mismatch. Previous work typically solved this problem via two different approaches: 1) using external word aligners to do the label projection from source to target, or 2) inserting marker tokens directly into the input of a strong (N)MT system and basically conducting a standard translate-train approach (but with those extra markers). However, both prior approaches have issues as the former critically relies on the quality of the external word aligner, while the latter yields to degraded MT performance (due to the insertion of markers).\n\nThis paper basically proposes an extension to the latter approach, aiming to preserve the original quality of the MT system by bypassing the direct insertion of markers, and proposes a two-step approach where in Step 1) the original text can be translated (via translate-train or translate-test), and in Step 2) projection is added via constrained decoding, keeping the translation from Step 1 as a fixed template. The main technical contribution is then a computationally feasible technique for the constrained decoding, bypassing the need to conduct exhaustive brute force search while maintaining strong performance. The separation of the translation and marker insertion steps also allows the approach to be applied to the translate-test setting, and the results confirm the usefulness of the technique."
