                "value": "### Problem Statement\nThe paper discusses the significant problem concerning the assurance of stability of data-driven controlling of robots, especially when the learned dynamics are controlled by neural networks. Stability is critical to prevent robots from executing harmful or undesirable actions. However, achieving global stability in dynamical systems learned from data proves challenging.\n\n### Main Contribution\nThe primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new methodology called Neural Contractive Dynamical Systems (NCDS), which can guarantee contractive stability for the dynamics it learns, in both Euclidean and SO(3) manifolds.\nThis makes NCDS a highly adaptable learning architecture offering contractive stability guarantees and obstacle avoidance capabilities. The empirical results show that their approach encodes desired dynamics more accurately compared to existing state-of-the-art methods while providing stronger stability guarantees. Through NCDS, the authors aim to bridge the gap between learning robot dynamics from demonstrations and ensuring stability, which has been a notable challenge due to the extrapolating behavior of neural network models.\n\n### Methodology\nThis methodology is designed to learn stable dynamical systems by constructing negative definite Jacobian from the output of neural network to ensure contraction, thus leading to global stability. The authors extend this method to address high-dimensional dynamical systems by developing a variant of the variational autoencoder using flow-based diffeomorphisms, which learns dynamics in a low-dimensional latent space while maintaining contractive stability post-decoding. They further extend their methodology to include contractive systems on the Lie group of rotations, catering to full-pose end-effector dynamic motions. The method can also be incorporated with a matrix-modulation technique to enable obstacle avoidance.\n\n### Experiments\nThe paper evaluates the effectiveness and scalability of Neural Contractive Dynamical Systems (NCDS) through synthetic and real-world tasks. Initial tests on 2D trajectories from the LASA dataset demonstrated NCDS's capability in capturing and replicating underlying dynamics, even in regions not covered by original data. Compared to baseline methods like Euclideanizing flow, Imitation flow, and SEDS, NCDS was the only method showing contractive behavior indicative of stability. When scaled to higher-dimensional data (LASA-4D and LASA-8D datasets), NCDS maintained a good performance, contrary to the deteriorating performance of baseline methods.\n\nFurthermore, the obstacle avoidance capability of NCDS was showcased on the LASA dataset, with successful generation of safe trajectories around obstacles. Real-world robot experiments on a 7-DoF Franka-Emika robotic manipulator underlined NCDS's effectiveness in reproducing demonstrated dynamics and adapting to physical perturbations. The experiments collectively underline NCDS's potential in managing various aspects of robotic motion learning, ensuring stability, and navigating obstacles, crucial for advancing real-world robotic applications."

The conservative and non-diverging extrapolation that comes with the contractiveness enabled by this work could also benefit neural modeling of other dynamical systems apart from robotics, as the neural ordinary differential equations are known to have difficulty modeling dynamical systems when data is not enough to cover the state space, as the unregularized extrapolation of neural networks could easily lead to numerical instability during integration. Therefore this work is not only innovative but also has potentially significant impact to the community.\n\n### Quality\n\nThe work derives the method from contraction theory and designed practical algorithms for data-driven robotics tasks, and compared with several state of the art baselines.\n\n### Clarity\n\nThe writing of the paper is great. It excellently motivates the work and explains the method and results well with proper details."

                "value": "This paper introduces a method to learn contractive dynamical systems. One method of constructing contractive systems has been to apply a diffeomorphism to provide a change of coordinates to a known contractive system. This paper proposes to use a VAE instead of a diffeomorphism, and constructs the decoder such that it is injective. As such, by enforcing that the latent dynamics is contractive, the dynamics in the data space will also be contractive. The paper also extends the method to Lie groups to account for end-effector orientation.\n\nThe paper is generally well-written, the method appears sound, and the motivations are clear. My main concerns are as follows:\n\n1. Theorem 1 states that the contractivity is perserved under a diffeomorphism. There is a lack of analysis and formal guarentees around the assumption that an injective function acting on a lower dimensional contractive system produces a higher-D contractive system. Just as a thought experiment, what happens to coordinate points in the higher-D data space where there does not exist a coordinate in the lower-D latent space? \n\n2. How is the collision-avoidance on the entire manipulator handled? The learned dynamical system seems to model the end-effector pose, but collision-avoidance should be handled across the body of the robot. One approach to handle this is to pull the dynamical system to the C-space of the robot and define body-points for the collision-avoidance, as done in (Zhi 2022, L4DC). This is a relevant reference and should be reviewed, as it also takes a diffeomorphic learning approach.\n\nOverall, I believe this is a neat idea, but more clarity around the theoretical insights is needed. I'm happy to raise my score when my concerns have been address."
