Since these two metrics are the basis of the main results in Table 1, it is important to clarify their definition and justify their meaningfulness. It is particularly useful to show what is the real-world consequences of lower Insertion or Deletion.\n\n4- The paper mentions that Grad-CAM and Score-CAM perform poorly in non-CNN models, however, all the results in the paper are reported with CNN based models, so a comparison to these methods are required.\n\n5- The paper can improve in writing (also Figure 1 is not clear to me). Please make sure claims are either backed by specific citations or experiments, for example: \u201cUnfortunately, these two methods are more suitable for CNNs and perform poorly in non-CNN cases\u201d.\n\n6- minor typo: Section 4.2 must be \\Delta x_k not x_t"
