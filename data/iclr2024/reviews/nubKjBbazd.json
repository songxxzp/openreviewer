To enhance APD's effectiveness, class attention maps are incorporated to refine dropped regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of APD."

Simple experiments are conducted to verify the mutual influence between perturbations. APD breaks the synergy by leveraging the class activation map (CAM) to dropout perturbations.

The attention regions may shift during the attack iterations; therefore, it is unreliable to rely on the CAM from the previous iteration as guidance for the current one.\n\n3. The experiment compares AA-TI-DIM(SOTA) and some classic transfer-based attacks with APD. It would be better if comparisons with relevant methods such as the previously mentioned PI-attack that extends the perturbation to cover the object, or other dropout methods, can be made.\n\n4. In order to verify the mutual influence between perturbations from different regions, the paper compares random noise removal with selective noise removal. It removes perturbations in regions in which the source model focuses while the target model does not. It would be more convincing if noises in regions that both source and target models neglect were removed. \n\n5. In the experiments, MI and other transfer-based attacks are used as baselines but PGD attack is not presented.\n\n6. In terms of dataset, the expression is not rigorous (the chosen images can be almost classified correctly by all models, i.e., the model has a high accuracy). Images correctly classified by all used models in this paper can be selected from ImageNet.\n\n7. The proposed APD method can be more intuitive if the flow chart is provided. \n\n8. The evaluation of APD\u2019s performance is limited and not comprehensive due to a lack of diversity of model architectures. Only transferability across CNNs is presented in the paper but other popular models like ViTs and SNNs are not considered, which is important in terms of transferability evaluation.
