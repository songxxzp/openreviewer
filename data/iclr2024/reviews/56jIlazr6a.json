The benchmark method, reject-or-classify (RC), abstains from prediction if the epistemic uncertainty is high, and otherwise produces an in-domain prediction. The RC method follows a \"hard\" way to classify a sample into the out-domain class, while the proposed U2C method takes a softer approach by concatenating an epistemic uncertainty score to the logit vector of a pre-trained predictor, before passing the augmented vector to a softmax layer. The problem does not assume the accessibility of out-domain data, so the U2C method picks the most epistemically uncertain data from the training set and then replaces their original labels with a new out-domain label."

The separation of epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric scores in the RC method inevitably induces various inconveniences, as discussed in the introduction, and the U2C framework is a natural attempt to construct \"epistemic scores\" that are comparable to aleatoric scores.\n\n2. The U2C framework identifies a new problem formulation for uncertainty calibration, and I think one contribution of the work is to formulate this \"calibration\" task under the OOD setting. \n\n3. The algorithm benefits from a good epistemic uncertainty estimator and a high-performance calibrating algorithm, making it adaptive and flexible."

Such treatments rely on the belief that OOD samples have comparable epistemic uncertainties to the most uncertain data in the training set. What if the epistemic uncertainty completely fails to capture the uncertainty of the OOD samples? Say, for a dog-v.s.-cat binary classification task, and the OOD class is mouse, what if the trained model predicts a score of (0.8,0.2) for a mouse image that wrongly classifies the mouse as dog?\n\n2. The theoretical part is a bit weak. For example, in Lemma 5.2 the paper criticizes the RC method by claiming that the losses pick infinity values in certain cases, while in practical implements the losses are truncated to avoid the occurrence of infinite values. \n\nMinor comments:\n\n1. It says \"Roughly speaking, neural networks with small ece produce calibrated confidence scores, meaning XXX\". This claim is wrong and misleading. Formula (2) is a \"marginal\" performance measure, while the XXX formula therein is an \"individual\"/\"conditional\" criterion. The marginal one can't imply an individual guarantee. \n\n2.

Current methods use a simple \"reject-or-classify\" rule to abstain from prediction when epistemic uncertainty is high. However, this approach has issues - the two uncertainties don't communicate, predictions are miscalibrated, and epistemic estimates may be misspecified.\nThe proposed Unified Uncertainty Calibration (U2C) framework allows both kinds of uncertainties to communicate with each other, resulting in well-calibrated probabilistic predictions. The key ideas are: relabeling the 5% most uncertain validation data as OOD. Blend aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties into an extended (c+1 class) softmax vector. Learn a non-linear calibration function of the epistemic uncertainty by minimizing the cross-entropy on the relabeled validation set.

It is also strange (although technically correct) to write the outer expectation over (x, y) \\sim P -- the outer expectation is only over x \\sim P_X. Please see one of the references you have cited for the right measure-theoretic definition. \n- The first sentence of page 4 is, \"In practice, a classifier models aleatoric uncertainty if it is well calibrated (Guo et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2021), namely it satisfies \\pi_f (x) \u2248 P(Y = y | X = x) for all examples (x, y).\"\nNeither of the papers claim that calibration models aleatoric uncertainty, or that the learnt \\pi_f is close to the true regression function, so this is an unsubstantiated opinion of the authors. Also, it is impossible to learn the true regression function, and none of these methods do it (or claim to). \n- Section 3.1: \"In machine learning research, aleatoric uncertainty arises due to irreducible sources of randomness in the process of labeling data.\" This is a strange statement that also falsely implies that all source of aleatoric uncertainty is annotator noise. \n- Section 3.2: \"Epistemic uncertainty is an unsupervised quantity, and as such it is more challenging to estimate than its supervised counterpart, aleatoric uncertainty.\" (no citation is provided)\n\nSome other writing issues: \n- The function u(x), central to the method of the paper, is mentioned inline as part of examples which were listed only for the sake of completeness (in the authors' words). \n- There are two lemmas but no theorem. \n- Changing notation: from \\tau_u to \\tau^u\n- What is an example of a \"non-linear\" \\tilde{\\tau}_u in eq. (7)? This is so central to the method that it should be transparent at first reading. \n\nThe theoretical results are not noteworthy, and are better presented as an illustrative synthetic example involving some computation. Lemma 5.1 is a decomposition of errors. Lemma 5.2 verifies that RC does not do well on the given example. \n\nI had some issues understanding the method, but I believe it essentially boils down to relabeling some percentage of the validation dataset as out-of-sample, then learning some model to predict those out-of-sample points. Then a softmax is applied in the end to make sure things sum to one. The method makes sense but I feel lacks the level of novelty expected from ICLR."
