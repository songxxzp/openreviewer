                "value": "### Theoretical Investigation\n\nI find that Sec. 3.1 is somewhat hard to follow. The message / motivation it tries to convey is unclear to me. See specific comments or questions below.\n\n1. The conclusion of Theorem 1 is \"given a sufficient amount of training data and a small optimal risk, ..., the issue of over-confidence for ID data is highly probable to arise\". However, the equation is only related to \"over-confidence\" (which I assume refers to excessive maximum softmax probability according to Eq. 2) when the loss is exactly cross-entropy loss. If we use label smoothing as the loss (although it is later empirically shown not to work), then there won't be over-confidence by looking at Eq. 4.\n\n2. My same argument could be applied to Theorem 2 as well. Furthermore, I can't see how exactly the \"over-confidence in OOD data\" is reflected in Theorem 2. More elaboration and clarification is necessary.\n\n3. The concluding paragraph under Theorem 2 makes me lost again. Why we want to \"access real OOD data to reduce the distribution discrepancy during training\"? What does it mean to \"reduce the distribution discrepancy\" (the $d(\\theta)$ in Theorem 2?) between ID and OOD? Meanwhile, why suddenly \"limited training ID data\", \"overfitting\", and \"the failure of ID classification\" become issues for OOD detection?\n\n4. Lastly, where are the proofs of the Theorems (or where are the references if they were proved by existing works)?\n\n\n\n### Design of SMOT\n\n1. Eq. 9 seems a little arbitrary. Why using a temperature-scaled exponential function? What's the intuition behind it? Why (t - 255)? What is the value range of t?\n\n### Experiments\n\n1. One limitation of the experiments and presented results is the fact that all considered OOD datasets are far-OOD which are easier to be detected. I expect to see more results on near-OOD splits (e.g., CIFAR-100 or Tiny ImageNet for CIFAR-10, SSB or NINCO for ImageNet), which are more likely to translate to real-world where the OOD images can be extremely similar to ID images.\n\n2. The baseline selection seems a bit arbitrary. How does SMOT compare with recent top-performing methods (e.g., ASH [1] as identified by OpenOOD [2])? Also, a highly relevant baseline is missing (see below \"Related Work\" for details).\n\n3. Why the training budget and learning rate scheduler is different between base models and SMOT models? Specifically, base models are trained for 200 epochs, while the \"final model\" with the proposed SMOT loss is trained for 300 epochs). Meanwhile, the base model adopts a step-wise learning rate decay schedule, while the final model uses the more advanced cosine decay. Is this a fair comparison, especially given that both longer training and sophisticated scheduler exactly benefit OOD detection (Table 5 in [3])?\n\n4. Lastly, an important ablation study that I believe should be included is how SMOT compares with random masking / cropping. This would better justify SMOT's design of leveraging CAM to determine the masking region.\n\n### Related Work\nSec. 5 should be more thorough and informative. Specifically, notice that the general idea of using corrupted / perturbed images associated with soft labels has been explored in at least two works in the field of OOD detection [4, 5]. Among these, [4] is in particular relevant to this work. I put up a table below making high-level comparison between [4] and this work.\n\n|      | soft target |  perturbation  | needs a pre-trained model? | \n|------|-------------|---|------|\n| [4]  |  $y_\\epsilon=(1-\\epsilon)\\cdot y + \\epsilon / K \\cdot u$ (see their Eq. 3)  |   image corruptions defined by ImageNet-C   | a pre-trained classifier for determining $\\epsilon$ |\n| SMOT |  $y_\\epsilon=(1-\\epsilon)\\cdot y + \\epsilon / K \\cdot u$ (Eq. 5 in this work)   |  masking  | a pre-trained classifier for generating CAM mask |\n\nFrom the above table, it is not obvious what advantages SMOT can offer over [4] (e.g., less compute, not requiring a pre-trained model). Therefore, I believe that [4] should be not only referenced but also included as an actual baseline to show that CAM-based masking and the associated method for assigning $\\epsilon$ value are better than the designs of [4].\n\n### Format\nThe references are inserted absurdly (e.g. \"ResNet18 He et al. (2016)\") which I believe are not in the most appropriate format. There are also some mis-formatting, e.g. \"Eq.equation 8\" in \"Training details\".\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n[1]  Extremely simple activation shaping for out-of-distribution detection\n\n[2] OpenOOD v1.5: Enhanced Benchmark for Out-of-Distribution Detection \n\n[3] Open-Set Recognition: A Good Closed-Set Classifier Is All You Need\n\n[4] Bridging In- and Out-of-distribution Samples for Their Better Discriminability\n\n[5] Mixture Outlier Exposure: Towards Out-of-Distribution Detection in Fine-grained Environments"
