Subsequent optimization for the model parameters yields the vector representation. The dataset used contains 87M clicks and the result improves over the DSSM model on both precision (by small largin) and recall (by a bigger margin, especially on tail data)."

The authors propose a probabilistic approach in the setting of two-tower approaches, by extending the InfoNCE loss. The approach is evaluated in a dataset of user click logs and compared with two baselines."

Could you please give more details for the dataset? What type of user log are these? How the model that you train looks like? What features do you have? How large is the set of unique items? The dataset as well as the architecture used is described very briefly.\n\nWhy you select such a large number for k? Does this artificially inflate the metrics you measure? Usually we would try to retrieve a small set of elements to feed to a ranker.\n\nHow significant is the result that you achieve?

Probabilistic embedding has a long history in machine learning, as well as probabilistic information retrieval, at least dating back to probabilistic ranking principle (Robertson, 1977), which essentially seeks to model the relevance of items to a query. Such literature was not reviewed in the paper. Furthermore, this formulation for modelling the retrieval probability and learning embeddings based on contrastive losses is not new to the community (see [1] and the references therein). \n\n2. Given the development of embedding retrieval models, the chosen baseline DSSM is quite old (2013). which cannot substantiate the usefulness of the proposed method over existing approaches. \n\n[1] Chun et al.

                "value": "1. In Section 3.3.2, the current model pEBR also relies on the chosen threshold $t$. Could the authors explain how sensitive it is to the model performance and at what value one should set it in practice? \n\n2. The choice of fixed threshold for $K$ items is mainly for saving inference cost. As detailed in Appendix A, it seems that computing the probabilistic CDF threshold can be slow, thus practically undesirable given the time constraints. If this system is in place, could the authors verify this has little impact on the product experience? \n\n3. The authors claim that without the probabilistic assumption, the model can fall short of generalisation ability. Any empirical evidence to support this, in comparison with the frequentist approaches?"
