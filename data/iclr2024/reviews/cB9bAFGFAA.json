                "value": "Though FedSRC shows good results in the special scenarios given in this paper, the motivations announced by the authors do not make sense to me. Specifically,\n\n1.\tThe authors claim that FedSRC can maintain the anonymity of clients compared with adaptive client selection methods. However, as the clients need to communicate with the server with network protocols, the server can always collect the IP address of each client, which makes it not practical to maintain anonymity in federated learning even with FedSRC. \n\n2.\tThe authors claim that only the clients with low inference losses participate in the training, which is irrational and may violate fairness significantly. The clients with low losses are trained and then attain lower losses in the next round, while the clients with high losses are never trained and attain higher losses in the next round. As a result, clients with high losses will never participate in training, which makes the global model highly biased. Accordingly, FedSRC may not have good performance on general scenarios beyond the settings used in the paper.\n\n3.\tClient-side selection is more vulnerable to malicious clients since the server cannot control the participation at all. This makes the Byzantine Attack easier. Although the authors claim that their method can be combined with server-side defenses, the server may need to spend more effort in defending against the adaptive attacks targeting FedSRC. The paper does not provide any results about the robustness of FedSRC combined with other defense methods.\n\n4.\tThe authors claim that FedSRC can save the communication overhead. However, FedSRC requires each client to download the global model in every round, which is not required by standard federated learning algorithms. This part will significantly increase the communication round compared to FedAVG with partial participation."

They are obtained in the particular scenarios where bad clients have noisy observations. For example, the same conclusions may not hold in the label flipping scenario. \n* The modelling of  the problem, and some of the definitions  are not always clear.  \n    * Definition 1 is informal. It does not precise what does inclusion means, and  what the \"converged global objective\" refers to (is it the global objective $F$ (defined in (1)) or the objective of the good clients $F_g$?).  \n    * I am unsure how (2) is obtained. It seems that the paper assumes that $w^* = w_{g}^{*}$. Overall, I have the impression that the paper confuses $F$ with $F_g$. \n* The technical novelty of the paper is not clear. The theoretical results of this paper are an8 application of the convergence analysis of federated   optimization for biased client selection strategies, first presented in (Cho et al., 2022).\n* The description of the experimental settings does not precise if the loss/accuracy are computed on the good clients only, or on all the clients. Moreover, it does not precise how  the individual clients' losses are averaged. \n* Other minor concerns: \n   * The paper cites other references using the author mode, when it should use the parenthesis mode. For example, the sentence *...like Google's Board Hard et al. (2019)...* should be written *...like Google's Board (Hard et al., 2019)...*\n   * Sometimes, the paper makes a mistake in the usage of the \\ref command, e.g., Eq. equation 1 (in Section 2.1). \n   * When the paper introduces the shadow sequence $\\bar{w}$ at the end of Section 2.1, it should mention that this technique was introduced in prior works, and cite them. \n\n\n----\nReferences \n- Xuezhen Tu, Kun Zhu, Nguyen Cong Luong, Dusit Niyato, Yang Zhang, and Juan Li. \"Incentive Mechanisms for Federated Learning: From Economic and Game Theoretic Perspective\".

                "value": "The paper introduces FedSRC (Federated Learning with Self-Regulating Clients), a novel approach to address slow convergence and suboptimal performance in Federated Learning (FL) due to data heterogeneity and quality concerns. FedSRC empowers clients to autonomously regulate their participation by using a lightweight \"checkpoint\" to evaluate their training's impact on the global model. This novel approach significantly reduces communication and computational overhead while improving FL performance. The paper also provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of FL convergence under data quality issues, showcasing the effectiveness of FedSRC. Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets validate the efficacy of FedSRC, notably reducing communication costs by up to 30% and computational costs by up to 55% over equivalent rounds."

Originality: FedSRC introduces an innovative, self-regulating client mechanism, departing from conventional strategies and reducing communication and computational overhead.\n\n2. Quality: The paper maintains high-quality standards through its structured elucidation of FedSRC, theoretical analysis, and comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse datasets.\n\n3. Clarity: The paper excels in lucidly conveying core concepts, methodologies, and findings in a coherent and accessible manner, ensuring broad readership comprehension."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Baseline Choice Concerns: The reliance on honest client reporting may lack robustness against malicious clients in contrast to Byzantine fault-tolerant baseline methods.\n\n2. Data Quality and Non-IID Issues: The inference loss-based checkpoint might struggle to discern between unreliable data and non-IID aspects, potentially leading to deteriorating model performance.\n\n3. Lack of Replicability and Experimentation: Explicit details regarding data partitioning methods and other parameters are absent, hindering replicability. Additionally, the paper lacks experimentation with various non-IID partitioning strategies and different data corruption ratios, which could illuminate the algorithm's robustness."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1.\tThe paper could benefit from a more extensive comparative analysis of its performance with a broader range of Federated Learning baselines, particularly those that also need an honest and trustworthy client environment. Meanwhile, it is advisable to provide a detailed description of the experimental setups and hyperparameters for these baseline methods to allow for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n2.\tAdditionally, the paper should consider conducting comparative experiments under various non-IID data partitioning strategies and explore the distribution of data possessed by clients that were discarded. This is particularly important due to concerns regarding the algorithm's performance in non-IID scenarios, as it appears to have a propensity for outright discarding all extremely non-IID clients.  Examining a variety of non-IID scenarios would provide a more realistic assessment of its capabilities.\n\n3.\tFurthermore, the paper should clarify the protocol for client re-inclusion. If a client's Inference Loss falls below the specified threshold in one round, will it automatically rejoin the subsequent training rounds? This aspect requires attention since repeated loss checks could lead to increased communication and computational overhead. It is essential to establish a mechanism to determine when clients with Inference Loss below the threshold can re-enter the FL process, preventing the permanent exclusion of potentially valuable clients."
