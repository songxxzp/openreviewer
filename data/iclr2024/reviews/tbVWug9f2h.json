The task is translation between English and Kalamang, an endangered language with little to no online presence. The authors introduce a new dataset, MTOB (Machine Translation from One Book), which contains (1) a linguistic analysis of the Kalamang language, (2) a bilingual dictionary, and (3) a small English-Kalamang parallel corpus. They benchmark several LLMs on the translation task, experimenting with different in-context learning settings. They find that the bilingual dictionary and parallel corpus enables some translation capabilities, and a large context size learning from the grammar book leads to notable performance gains. However, no LLMs outperform a human baseline."

Novel benchmark --**\n\nMTOB is a unique benchmark that enables interesting experiments. It would undoubtedly be a useful resource for future work, as it offers an alternative to the current paradigm of raw text training and highly structured fine-tuning. The idea of using it to mimic second language learning is interesting.\n\n**-- 2. New experimental ideas --**\n\nThe paper introduces a few new ideas in its experimental framework with the aim of testing generalization capabilities beyond the training set.\n1. Using content guaranteed to not be on the web.\n2. Testing model knowledge on the task *before* training to check for potential train-test overlap.\n3. The motivation of testing crystalised intelligence, as opposed to fluid intelligence.\n\nThese are all ideas that could find use in other contexts/domains.\n\n**-- 3. Interesting findings --**\n\nThe experiments reported reveal some insightful findings. For example, the failure of traditional finetuning in this setting is interesting, and so is the difficulty of incorporating grammar knowledge into smaller context LLMs. \n\n**-- 4. Handling of ethical considerations --**\n\nThe authors actively engage with ethical considerations around working with an endangered language. Their approach in working with the Kalamang language community is a model for how other NLP researchers should proceed."

                "value": "While the topic of interest and proposed dataset are novel contributions, my main concern with the paper is the lack of innovation in terms of modelling and evaluation. Furthermore, I believe more should be done to prove that this task is truly distinct from standard extremely low-resource translation. This could be shown empirically through experiments comparing Kalamang translation to translation involving other (somewhat online) extremely low-resource languages.\n\n**-- 1. Narrow modelling comparisons --**\n\nThe experiments would be improved by comparing other types of models besides recent LLMs. Sequence-to-sequence PLMs like mT5 have been shown to perform well on low-resource MT (https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.223.pdf) .\n\nFurthermore, the nature of MTOB could be leveraged by more specialised neural architectures, such as neural MT models that incorporate bilingual dictionaries (https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.382/, https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.143.pdf). An analysis spanning different models would reveal more about the true difficulty of the task. There is a growing literature evaluating LLMs for low-resource MT (e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07423v1.pdf) and so far it seems that they fall short of massively multilingual NMT models, which could just be because they are trained/tuned for very different types of tasks.\n\n**-- 2. Insufficient interpretable evaluation--**\n\nWhile some qualitative examples are provided in the appendix, the paper would be strengthened by more such analysis. Could error types across models / in-context settings be quantified to some extent? More generally, since MTOB is framed as a unique benchmark, I would expect some interesting findings from a more nuanced evaluation framework (along the lines of page 7, paragraph 3 \u201cIn contrast, the grammar book\u2026\u201d). Such analysis could help motivate why MTOB is unique (e.g. if it is found that LLMs make certain types of errors on MTOB that they do not make on other tasks).\n\n**-- 3. Lack of comparison to extremely low-resource MT--**\n\nWhile any knowledge of the Kalamang language is new to the LLMs, the task itself (translation) is well known to LLMs given the wide availability of parallel corpora online and the popularity of machine translation as a task. The authors discuss this distinction themselves (fluid vs crystalised intelligence). However, there is some doubt as to how different English to Kalamang translation is in terms of task difficulty, compared to translation involving other extremely low-resource languages that have a limited online presence. This would call into question the value of MTOB as an NLP resource, as it is currently being claimed in the paper.\n\nFor example, it seems that for some extremely low-resource languages LLMs have basically no translation capabilities (see some of the zero-shot experiments here https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07423v1.pdf), even thought these languages are included in publicly available test sets. The paper would be improved through some comparison of the MTOB task with extremely low-resource MT e.g. qualitative differences in model performance or proof of data contamination even for extremely low-resource languages."

An additional baseline is also provided in the form of a human who learnt the language from the same reference materials.\n\nThe approach is interesting in that it constitutes a modern take on rule-based MT, where instead of providing a structured grammar to a heavily feature-engineered model, the hope is that the language model will learn itself to interpret the human-readable descriptions. It is very valuable as a way of evaluating LLM performance on a clearly measurable, task-oriented benchmark which has direct real-world applications (translation of under-resourced languages.)"
