                "value": "There are many limitations in the method that severely limit the usefulness/contribution to the audio community. The main issue is that the authors used two agents which probed 3000 different position pairs in order to learn the RIR for the room. This is a massive amount of data that needs to be collected and would be impractical in the real-world. This is in contrast to methods like \"Few-Shot Audio-Visual Learning of Environment Acoustics\" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04006.pdf) which use images as well as a couple audio measurements to estimate the room RIR. If we assume that you need 3000 training examples for a room and it takes a few seconds to collect each example, then you are looking at several hours of data collection needed to map out the room RIR.\n\nThe 2m distance between a train/test example is great for the synthetic dataset, but for the real world dataset, this isn't followed as the space itself is much smaller and probably would not facilitate a 2m distance between a test example and the nearest training example. This means that the real experiments probably had training examples in locations that were very close to the test examples. (Please correct me if you did also follow the 2m distance in the MeshRIR dataset)\n\nThere is not much discussion about how to choose these locations, except for that the authors say the goal is to reach as much of the room in as few steps as possible.\n\nFurthermore, the authors assume that there are no other background noises in the environment. This makes it even harder to map out a room RIR in the real world. I would expect that machine learning systems would be capable of fitting an RIR, even in the presence of some amount of background noise, when presented with several hours of recordings in that environment."

Explanations on the LTI room acoustics physical principles are good. \n\n- The proposed multi-scale position-aware feature extraction method appears to be a clever idea that can capture the positional information of the scene at various granularity."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The method assumes two agents that are time-synchronized. The synchronization must be very precise, while it might not be entirely easy depending on what kind of agents are used, especially if they are only wirelessly connected. In fact, the paper doesn't seem to try out the method using a pair of physical devices. Instead, even the real-world experiments are based on the pre-recorded RIRs. This somehow limits the proposed methods' applicability only to simulated environments. More elaboration is needed as to what kind of physical devices are going to be used. \n\n- The locations entirely ignore the height dimension, making the RIR estimation limited to a 2D room shape. I think the proposed method could still be meaningful with this limitation, but totally ignoring this third dimension must result in suboptimal performance, e.g., incorrect RIR estimation. The paper doesn't discuss this aspect at all. \n\n- The directionality of the speaker and microphone is ignored, too. Since in the real-world acoustic scene, a point source and omnidirectional microphones are rare, the proposed method must exhibit limitations when a directional source at the same location goes through different RIR filters. Again, this doesn't entirely negate the usefulness of the proposed method, but the paper simply lacks a discussion on this issue at all. \n\n- The setup completely ignores the effect of furniture and wall reflection rates; at least there is no description about them on the paper. \n\n- Finally, the PESQ scores need more explanation. According to the description, it appears that the experiments were done first by predicting the RIR filter and convolve the clean speech using the estimated filter. Then the comparison should be between the ground-truth reverberant speech using the ground-truth RIR filter and the estimated reverberant speech using the estimated RIR filter. I'm not sure if PESQ is defined for this case, because typically it's to compare clean speech and its estimation. If the authors compared the estimated reverberant speech with clean one, then the comparison of PESQ scores is pointless. Needs more clarification here. \n\n- Other objective metrics that compare RIR filters are not interpretable. For example, a large SNR value is good, but, for example, a 6dB SNR on RIR reconstruction doesn't necessarily give any intuition about the quality. PESQ or more speech-related ones might be better, but as mentioned earlier, that part needs clarification."
