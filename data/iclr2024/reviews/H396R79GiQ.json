A novel approach called skip-k-frame block-wise main directional mean optical flow (MDMO) feature is proposed by the authors for ME spotting. This is achieved using unfixed reference frames compared to existing work utilizing fixed reference frames. The paper introduces the readers to M-pattern, a distinct movement pattern and enhanced spotting rules based on M-pattern and ME characteristics. The article then presents block-wise MDMO features to remove global movements without compromising ME movements in the feature extraction stage. Experimental results on state-of-the-art datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing methods in ME spotting."
