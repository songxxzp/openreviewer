Such a blend appears to muddy the clear delineation traditionally maintained between these two methodologies, necessitating a more explicit justification or clarification regarding the algorithm\u2019s classification and operational principles.\n\nAnother notable shortcoming lies in the scope of experiments. The authors primarily tailor the AutoASL system to binary classification tasks, which curtails its generalizability and applicability across a broader spectrum of real-world problems. The omission of multi-class settings from the study's purview signifies a missed opportunity to showcase the method's versatility and robustness.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper does introduce a unique perspective within the AutoML domain, it tends to be circumscribed by limited applicability, a lack of rigorous theoretical foundation, and insufficient engagement with contemporary methodologies and advancements. These aspects warrant critical reflection and enhancement to bolster the method's credibility, robustness, and relevance within the evolving landscape of AutoML."

The inclusion of an oracle for true labels in the active learning component seems at odds with the autonomous nature of self-training. This amalgamation raises questions regarding the true autonomy of the proposed method and muddles the distinct identities traditionally associated with each methodology. A clearer justification or elaboration on this aspect would be beneficial for understanding the algorithm\u2019s unique operational principles.\n\n\n- **Experimental Scope:** The current study predominantly focuses on binary classification tasks, limiting the algorithm's demonstrated applicability and generalizability. The absence of experiments involving multi-class settings restricts insights into the versatility and robustness of the proposed AutoASL system. Expanding the range of experiments to encompass diverse classification scenarios would have enriched the evaluation and illustrated the algorithm's adaptability to varied real-world challenges.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The method exhibits a pronounced sensitivity to hyperparameters, which poses practical usability challenges. If users cannot ascertain and set hyperparameters effectively a priori, it could hinder the practical deployment and user-friendliness of this framework, making this aspect a significant limitation that needs addressing to bolster the model's utility in real-world applications.\n\n- **Reference to Contemporary Works:** There\u2019s a noticeable lack of engagement with recent advancements and scholarly works in both self-training and active leanring. Incorporating updated references and literature is essential to enhance the paper's contextual depth, comparative analysis, and alignment with contemporary scholarly discourse."

Understanding the degree of labeling required by the oracle is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's autonomy and practical applicability in semi-supervised learning contexts. \n\n- What guidance or strategy does the paper offer regarding the a priori selection of hyperparameters? Clear instructions or criteria for choosing hyperparameters beforehand are crucial for users who aim to apply this framework effectively in practical scenarios. Your elucidation on this aspect would significantly contribute to the model\u2019s usability and overall applicability.\n\n- Could the authors provide an ablation study for AutoASL? It would be insightful to discern which specific components contribute most significantly to the overall performance of the system.\n\n- The authors suggest extending the model to multi-class classification is relatively straightforward. Given this assertion, could you elucidate which components\u2014between self-training and active learning\u2014will likely be more pivotal or influential in a multi-class scenario?
