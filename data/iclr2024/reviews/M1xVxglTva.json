Experimental results highlight marked improvements over contemporary state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting."

I recommend a major revision, taking into account the following key points:\n\n1. **Clarity in Methodology**: The underlying advantages and rationale of the proposed method, especially in contrast to self-attention, need to be better delineated. It's imperative to provide a lucid exposition on the essence and necessity of each component in the proposed architecture.\n\n2. **Literature Review**: The discussion on related works appears insufficient. It's crucial to acknowledge and distinguish from significant contributions like DLinear[1], which emphasizes the utility of linear models in time series forecasting. Similarly, referencing works like TSMixer[2], which have explored replacing self-attention with linear layers, can offer richer context.\n\n3. **Definitions and Variables**: Ensure that all variables are introduced systematically and are well-defined. Premature introduction (e.g., $t, H, I$) or lack of definitions (e.g., $ B_{t-I:t}, X^{Simple}_{t-I:t}, \\theta_f, Linear(\\cdot), L_Simple $ ) hampers the readability and understanding of the paper.\n\n4. **Equations and Formalism**: The paper needs more rigor in its mathematical formalism. Ambiguities, like the mislabeling in Eq (4), should be rectified. Moreover, providing explicit rules or guidelines for matrix operations can help eliminate any confusion.\n\n5. **Complexity Analysis**: The complexity analysis appears to be flawed. Linear models also exhibit a quadratic complexity relative to the lengths. Current assessments, such as the interpretation of time growth in Fig 8, seem misleading, as external factors like GPU parallelism could influence the results.\n\n6. **Experimental Results**: The results derived from the Weather dataset looks doubtful. Consistent results across different forecast horizons make them suspect. Providing access to the code would be beneficial for verification purposes.\n\n[1] Zeng, Ailing, et al. \"Are transformers effective for time series forecasting?.\" Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence.

It remains unclear why errors on weather and exchange rate datasets remain constant across different forecasting horizons. Questions also arise regarding the training methodology of the single-layer linear function f - whether it's pre-trained independently or trained end to end with other parts of the encoder and decoder? More details about training the structural attention (such as data split, decomposition) should be discussed to ensure there is no data leakage problem when training the linear model.\n3. Why the proposed model has more smooth loss landscape? How does it compare to the landscape of other linear models like DLinear?\n4. S_{t:t+H} is essentially a linear mapping respect to trend or seasonality. Mathematically what are the differences between learning structural attention and learning a direct linear mapping from decomposed trend and seasonality components of the original data?"

As far as I can see (after checking the provided source code), the proposed method is trivial compared to previous models. Based on the operations listed in sec 3.2 and implementations,  it's essentially a linear model based on conventional time series decomposition. The motivation behind the designs are quite weak with neither strong intuition nor persuasive eidences, which makes the empirical results not convincing."

From eq (2), I can see $S_{t:t+H}$ is the weight of a new linear model by replacing the independent variable and intercept in $f$. What is the point of such transformation? In addition, since self-attention is substituted by such a linear model, it is not appropriate to name the method as \"Transformer\".\n2. The algorithm 1 is really confusing. Is $X_{simple}$ from trend or seasonality, or both? Which time series decomposition method is used? And I don't think such a trivial linear model training procedure needs to be highlighted. \n3. Are the linear layers in eq (5) (7) (8) different in terms of parameters? Are $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ in eq(9) scalars or vectors? How do you initialize and regularize them?"

I am assuming that the operations in Equation 1 are element wise as otherwise the dimensionality is incorrect. Even assuming that,  it is not clear what the definition of $B_{t-I:t}$ is. Is it learnt or just extracted from the data? Why is the matrix $S_{t:t+H}$ even called attention. It has no similarity to attention mechanism and just seems to be a element wise division. \n\nThe equations in section 3.2 where $H \\neq I$ is even more confusing. The authors never define a functional map from $X_{t-I:t}$ to $\\hat{X}_{t:t+H}^{Simple}$. The latter is never defined.\n\n2. The mapping  of Trend and Seasonality to the future predictions in the decoder part seems to be exactly the same as that of the DLinear model. Is that correct? \n\n3. Are the weights $\\alpha, \\beta$ and $\\gamma$ learnt during training? How are they set if not learnt?\n\n4. Given that the encoder part is not understandable and the two other components are exactly the same as that of DLinear I find the performance a bit unbelievable. The code is also not very easy to read as I don't know what \"IBM\" means as an input to the forward function. In Fig 1 can you also plot the predictions from DLinear.\n\n5. Why is the structural attention called \"attention\" when it seems to be a linear map and there is not attention mechanism?\n\n6. The paper talks about efficiency but only compares time complexity to other transformer models. There are more efficient MLP based models like TiDE[1], NHiTS that achieve similar performance but are much faster. It would be good to compare to and cite these works, in terms of efficiency and statistical performance.\n\n[1] Das A, Kong W, Leach A, Mathur S, Sen R, Yu R.
