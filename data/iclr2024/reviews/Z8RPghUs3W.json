                "value": "The paper introduces a novel class of analytic functions, establishing that any element within this class can be utilized to construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) constraint. This family of functions demonstrates closure properties with respect to addition, multiplication, and differentiation. The author employs the properties of analytic function to explore the relationship between the phenomena of vanishing gradients and the convergence radius. On the empirical front, the author conducted two synthetic experiments to evaluate the performance of various DAG constraints. The findings highlight that the DAG constraint depends on the prior knowledge of data scale."

While previous works have engaged in similar formulations to the proposed framework, the paper distinguishes itself through the analytic functions. The logical flow of the paper is commendable, facilitating ease of comprehension, although it is noted that there are certain aspects that remain ambiguous and warrant further clarification. Given the pivotal role of DAG constraints in the domain of structure learning, this work is poised to make a meaningful contribution."

                "value": "There are two concerns about this paper. Firstly, the author mainly studied the effect of different DAG constraints with linear functional relationships. However, I wonder if those observations can be transferred to non-linear settings as well, where instead of using a weighted matrix $B$, one can directly apply the constraint on binary adjacency matrix, see [1]. Since non-linear behavior is ubiquitous in real world, the analysis on non-linear setting can further improve the contribution of this paper. Secondly, there are some ambiguities that requires further clarifications.\n\n\n[1] Geffner, Tomas, et al. \"Deep end-to-end causal inference.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.02195 (2022)."

In the paper, \"dataset scale\" is an important concept but this has not bee properly introduced, what is the dataset scale and what do you mean be \"dataset scale is known\"? Do you provide extra information during model training?\n\n2. For the DAG constraints, it seems that we only need summation order to be $d$ to specify a DAG. What are the advantages of going to $\\infty$? Is it because $\\infty$ order allows the series to converge to a particular function so that it is easy to compute the gradient?\n\n3. In proposition, the $-n$ is for $(I-\\tilde{B})$ or $tr(I-\\tilde{B}))$? This can be quite misleading. For the previous discussion, I assume it is for $(I-\\tilde{B})$?\n\n4. Figure 1 is very helpful for the reader to understand the property of different DAG constraints. But the description of how figure 1 is generated is too vague, I think it would be helpful if the author can provide more details.\n\n5. For \"Choosing DAG constraints for different scenarios\", I did not follow the arguments made in that section. For example, why with known data scale, the objective can provide a larger gradient? Also, if we have a large constraints, it will still create many local optima even with a informative objective function, right? So the correct argument is to achieve an appropriate balance between objective and constraints?\n\n6. In experiment section, what is $\\otimes$? Is it Kronecker product? Why do you use this instead of $\\odot$?\n\n7. For the experiment 4.1 and 4.2, why the dimensionality differs by a lot? For 4.1, the dimensionality starts at 200 but in 4.2, the highest is 50. I also want to see the performance of PC with known true data scale."
