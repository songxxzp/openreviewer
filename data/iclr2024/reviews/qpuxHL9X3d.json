                "value": "**Presentation:**\n\n- In my initial reading, I found the paper's notation to be confusing. Moreover, all the crucial algorithms (ADS, GS, LS, EDA) are deferred to the Appendix, making for a less-than-smooth reading experience. Within the Appendix itself, these algorithms are distributed at different places in the 38-page paper, further complicating the reading process. I would request to consider moving a few of them (ADS, GS, LS, EDA, Target selection) to the main draft\n\n- As also suggested by Reviewer pdmN, this paper had many abbreviations and particularly difficult to follow sometimes. I request the authors to simplify the paper presentation and notations.\n\n**Technical:**\n\n- In my view, the proposed ADS for selecting the most effective search direction ($\\delta$) and loss function ($L$) based on the diversity measures at both input and output, appears quite straightforward. Additionally, the Diversity Index (DI) has been widely studied in Yamamura et al. 2021, thereby paper's technical contribution may be somewhat limited as it just picks the combinations based on this measure and $P_i^e$.\n\n- The GS and LS techniques introduced within the search framework are, to some extent, heuristic in nature. Although ablation studies have been carried out with respect to N1, N2, and N3, the current framework's configuration, comprising GS with N1 and N2 iterations, followed by LS with N3 iterations, strikes me as somewhat heuristic.\n\n- Upon closer examination, the differences in performance between ADS and Random appear negligible in Table 1, and the variation between GS+LS (ADS) and GS+LS (Random) seems relatively small. On average, across nine models, this difference stands at less than approximately 0.05% (please correct me if I'm wrong).\n\n- Notably, there exists a substantial number of hyperparameters tied to ADS, GS, LS, and the target selection schemes. While the paper presents ablation studies, I anticipate that the widespread adoption of the proposed method as a robust alternative to the AutoAttack suite might pose a considerable challenge. \n\n- ADS requires access to the dataset. The authors perform ADS on 1% of the data, while AutoAttack and other baseline attacks operate on a per-datapoint basis without depending on additional datapoints."

Are there any insights into the top $n_a$ combinations found by ADS for different models?\n\n- Why is ADS performed in the LS stage? What are the benefits of conducting it before LS?
