And what about gradient descent?\n\n(2) Could the results be generalized to multi-class classification? I am also wondering about other loss functions, but the Brier score should be trivial and the log-loss should require additional modifications.\n\n**Major comments**:\n(3) Before Corollary 1: While NTKs are dot-product kernels on the sphere, they are not in general dot-product kernels outside of the sphere. For example, from Eq. (15) we have $K_{ntk}(0, 0) = 1$, which means that $K_{ntk}$ cannot be a dot-product kernel. On the other hand, I also don't see why you would need it to be a dot-product kernel for Corollary 1.\n\n(4) In Theorem 2, you seem to implicitly assume that $\\alpha_0 = 1/\\beta$, see the text before Eq. (14) in the appendix. Please state this in the theorem. Moreover, it is not clear to me that this would also hold in the setting of Corollary 1 for general domains. In the special case of the sphere, this could be fixed at least for very similar network architectures because then the RKHS of the NTK is known to be a Sobolev space, see for example the proof of Theorem G.5 in https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14077\n\n(5) I am not fully convinced by the proposed smoothness estimator. For example, assume that the target function $f^*: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has different degrees $s_1$ and $s_2$ of (Sobolev) smoothness in dimensions $1$ and $2$. Then, I would expect the eigenvalues to decay at different rates depending on the direction that the eigenfunctions are more refined in, such that the eigenvalues in a plot as in Figure 1 (a) wouldn't lie on a single line but in between two lines corresponding to $s_1$ and $s_2$. Linear regression would then estimate a smoothness between $s_1$ and $s_2$, but in terms of interpolation spaces, the function would still only lie in the interpolation space with the lower smoothness. (This could be checked by just plotting the $p_j$ on the image data sets.) \n\nPerhaps this issue could be \"fixed\" by performing linear regression on top of $\\tilde p_j := \\sup_{k \\geq j} p_k$, which would try to filter out the \"upper line\" in the plot, but also potentially it could be more susceptible to noise. (Judging from the plots, perhaps it could be a good heuristic to automatically set the threshold in a way that only those $p_j$ are included that are larger than the maximum in the right half of the plot.) Another idea for the estimator would be to stay closer to the definition of interpolation spaces and work with (approximations of) the interpolation space norms of the regression function, maybe something like finding an \"elbow\" in $s \\mapsto y^\\top (K + \\lambda I)^{-1} K^s (K + \\lambda I)^{-1} y$.\n\nBesides the mixed smoothness case, another important case is the \"manifold assumption\" case where $\\mu$ is supported on a submanifold, and which is a popular assumption for image data sets. I am wondering whether the estimator can be trusted in this case.\nAnother potential test case is what happens if the classes are well-separated and non-noisy, i.e., with $\\eta(x) \\in \\{1, -1, \\text{undefined}\\}$. This is arguably close to the situation for MNIST. Can the estimator find out that the function is arbitrarily smooth?\nIn general, it would be interesting to see whether the rates predicted by the theory and the simple estimation method hold up in a practical setting.\n(I'm brainstorming a bit here, it is not necessary to try everything in order to address my comment.)\n\n**Minor comments**:\n- p. 1: Use \\operatorname{sign} or something like this to set the sign operator in non-italic font. (same for later)\n- \"trained via the gradient flow\" -> \"trained via gradient flow\"\n- Sec 1.1 i) \"bounded by $...$\" there should be a constant $C$ or an O-notation in there.\n- Please don't use all-caps for author names in citations (STEINWART & SCOVEL, 2007).\n- p. 3: \"Recently, Deep\" -> \"Recently, deep\"\n- \"gained incredible success\" -> \"achieved incredible success\" or so?\n- \"Another reason we choose\" -> \"Another reason why we choose\"?\n- \"spectra algorithm\" - should this be \"spectral algorithms\"? (also further below)\n- Same paragraph (last paragraph of Sec. 1): When you say \"Another reason ... NTK kernel ...\" it seems that this is essentially the same reason as before, just formulated in more detail.\n- Sec 2.3: Mention that it is gradient flow on the least-squares loss?\n- Assumption 3 could be formulated more clearly: $\\alpha_0$ always exists because $\\alpha = 1$ is always admissible by the bounded kernel assumption. Moreover, $\\alpha_0 > 0$ trivially because of the way that $\\alpha_0$ is defined. So here, I think Assumption 3 should be a definition (something like \"We define the embedding index $\\alpha_0$ as ...\"), unless you want to require $\\alpha_0 < 1$.\n- p. 6: \"minimax optimality of kernel classifier\" -> \"minimax optimality of kernel classifiers\"\n- p. 6: \"source condition 1\" -> \"source condition (Assumption 1)\"\n- \"Assumption 1, 2, and 3\" -> \"Assumptions 1, 2, and 3\"?\n- In Theorem 2: \"Assumption 1, 2, and3\" -> whitespace is missing\n- \"of the neural network classifier\" -> \"of neural network classifiers\"\n- Eq. (14): The last layer should use the matrix $W^L$, not $W^{(L, p)}$. (The latter notation seems to be a remnant of the mirrored initialization notation, which you do not adopt in the other parts of Eq. (14).)\n- The \"mirrored initialization\" seems to be already older and known as \"antisymmetric initialization trick\": http://proceedings.mlr.press/v107/zhang20a.html\n- The citation Hui (2020) is missing the second author M. Belkin.\n- The sentence before Proposition 1 is not ended by a period.\n- Before corollary 1: I think the eigenvalue decay shouldn't be $\\beta = d(d-1)$, maybe you meant $\\beta = d/(d-1)$?\n- p. 7: \"ground true function\" -> \"ground-truth function\"  (also in the conclusion)\n- p. 8, paragraph \"Estimation of $s$ in regression\": There is nothing sensible after the $\\in$ symbol \n- Related work: The authors could (briefly) mention/discuss other classes of assumptions that can be made in the classification setting, see e.g. https://projecteuclid.org/journals/electronic-journal-of-statistics/volume-12/issue-1/Improved-classification-rates-under-refined-margin-conditions/10.1214/18-EJS1406.full\n\n**Summary of discussion**:\nI missed an assumption in the NTK part, now I am not concerned about its correctness anymore. The smoothness estimator is still not reliable in general, which means that the experiments cannot fully support the appropriateness of the Sobolev assumption, but the authors acknowledge the limitations. In conclusion, I am changing my score from 5 to 6."
