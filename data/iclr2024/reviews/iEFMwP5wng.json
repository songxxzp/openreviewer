Based on these findings, the authors further proposed methods for the TTAed model\u2019s calibration and hyperparameter selection. The overall findings are novel but still not convincing enough, necessitating further justifications. So I currently give a borderline score and I will re-evaluate the paper after rebuttal.

Utilizing this insight, they enhance TTA reliability by introducing strategies for estimating Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) accuracy, recalibrating models, and tuning hyperparameters without labeled test data.

These models tended to show a \"line agreement\" behavior more than they did before.

The research predominantly revolves around CNNs, which is just one structure among the diverse architectures and applications in deep learning. To substantiate these findings' universality and efficacy, it's crucial to extend the studies to other network models and datasets, such as Vision Transformers (ViT) and Swin Transformers, and more complex tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. Confirming similar observations across a wider range of contexts would instill greater confidence in the authenticity and applicability of this phenomenon.\n\n**Heavy Reliance on Full Access to In-Distribution Data**: The methods proposed in the study assume complete access to in-distribution training data, an assumption impractical in many real-world scenarios. Constraints like computational resources or data privacy issues might restrict access to comprehensive in-distribution training data, leaving practitioners with only the trained model. Under these circumstances, the proposed evaluation method may become inapplicable, losing its value. The authors need to tackle this limitation, potentially necessitating the design of novel experiments or methods that support evaluation and adaptation in these more restrictive environments.\n\n**Discrepancy Between the Offline Nature of Methods and Practical Needs**: The methods introduced in this research operate within a static, offline setting, overlooking the dynamic, continuous arrival of data in real-world applications. In real-world scenarios, models must accommodate online or incremental data streams, known as online test-time adaptation. The researchers should contemplate this online setting and investigate whether their strategies remain effective when handling continuous data flows. This exploration might require new experimental setups and adaptability tests to simulate the reception conditions of data in the real world."

Based on this phenomenon, the authors adopt the ALine-S/D method to estimate OOD accuracy based on ID data and labels. With the estimated OOD accuracy, they further calculate the optimal scaling temperature to calibrate the model prediction for a lower expected calibration error. Moreover, the authors select the hyperparameters that enable the adapted model to obtain the best performance on the ID data as the optimal TTA hyperparameters on the OOD data. However, some significant issues are required to be further addressed. My detailed comments are as follows."

To enhance the manuscript, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide a more extensive explanation and discussion regarding this observed phenomenon.\n2. The proposed temperature scaling method may not be applicable in latency-sensitive real-world applications when considering efficiency. As described in section 3.2, the optimal temperature is calculated after the network makes predictions on the full test set. Therefore, the proposed method require a significant delay for model adaptation. More discussion on efficiency is required.\n3. Although the authors conduct experiments on different TTA methods, the problem setting of this paper is different from that of TTA. As shown in Algorithm 1, the proposed performance estimation method requires in-domain data and labels, which, however, are inaccessible under the settings of TTA.\n4. Figures 1-3 are difficult to understand. For example, it is unclear what the values of the horizontal and the vertical axes in Figure 1 represent. More explanations should be provided.\n5. The authors only analyze the agreement-on-the-line phenomenon on CNN-based models. However, powerful transformer-based models should also be involved in the experiments, such as ViT[1], Swin Transformer[2], PoolFormer[3], and so on.\n6. In the Introduction, the authors claim that \"Baek et al. (2022) show that the ID and OOD agreement between classifiers shows a strong linear correlation\". However, Baek et al. (2022) only study the correlation of disagreement and error between classifiers. It would be preferable to provide a more precise description.\n7. In Table 2, the authors only provide insufficient results on several domains of the test datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed performance estimation. It would be better if the authors could provide more experimental results under these datasets, such as all 15 corrupted datasets in ImageNet-C.\n8. In Figure 3, the authors demonstrate that the phenomenon of AGL and ACL also occurs when varying TTA hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size. However, from Table 1 to Table 3, the authors only study the effect of the proposed methods using different architectures or different training checkpoints. More ablation study using different hyperparameter setup is suggested.\n9. As shown in Figure 4, varying learning rate in TTT exhibits a negative correlation between ID and OOD accuracies. To establish a comprehensive study, more experiments should be conducted to verify if this phenomenon occurs in other test-time training methods, such as TTT++[4] and TTT-MAE[5].\n10.

The authors then use this observation in order to estimate performance on out-of-distribution data after TTA (without needing access to test labels), perform hyperparameter optimization and improve calibration after TTA."
