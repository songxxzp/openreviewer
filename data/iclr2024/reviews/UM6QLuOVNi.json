                "value": "The authors propose a new masking strategy for masked autoencoders for video representation learning. Instead of using random and tube masking which may select tokens from uninformative regions, the authors exploit the unequal information density among the patches by computing the Euclidean distance between the same location across adjacent frames. Moreover, they propose information-intensive frame selection which selects informative frames while discarding the not-so useful ones to learn diverse and robust representations. The new masking strategy is computationally less expensive than the recent masking strategies and it can also be plugged in during the fine-tuning. Experiments on various video datasets show the effectiveness of the masking strategy."

For example, For a ViT-L backbone with a batch size of 256, method achieves about 4\u00d7 less memory consumption than VideoMAE. Evaluation was performed using PT and FT GFlops, and memory usage in terms of GB.\n- Masking can be used during fine-tuning stage makes it better and faster than VideoMAE.\n- Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB-51, SSv2, K400, Ego4D."

I would encourage the authors to compare the approach with more baselines e,g, AdaMAE [1], MME [2], MVD [3], ST-MAE [4] for videos (using random masking), Omnimae [5].\n- It would be great to add a comparison of the masking strategy against multiple masking strategies. \n- Although the approach seems to be computationally less expensive, the results are about the same as VideoMAE, sometimes even degrades the performance of pre-trained masked autoencoder methods for videos (c.f, Table 5).\n\n### References:\n\n[1] AdaMAE: Adaptive Masking for Efficient Spatiotemporal Learning with Masked Autoencoders, CVPR 2023.\n\n[2] Masked Motion Encoding for Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning, CVPR 2023.\n\n[3] Masked Video Distillation: Rethinking Masked Feature Modeling for Self-supervised Video Representation, CVPR 2023.\n\n[4] Masked autoencoders as spatiotemporal learners.

The proposed method is simple and straightforward, which should not be considered a big innovation (see weakness) but the simplicity should be appreciated.  Such practical observation is somewhat useful the significance is determined by the effectiveness of the proposed method. I can't say the significance is huge through the current results (see weakness). The evaluation is extensive and I  think the visualization of this paper is pretty good.  Regarding clarity, I would say there is still space to improve since results can be organized better and this paper lacks in-depth analysis of the proposed method."

                "value": "1. The novelty of the proposed method is limited. First, I would say the similarity-based token selection method has been studied before.  An important baseline is K-centered Patch Sampling in [1]. The core idea is close, and the method both highly rely on the rank of the similarity matrix.  Second, the conclusion or observation of this paper is somewhat novel but has also been showed in previous work. In particular, the VideoMAE-V2 [2] has already been shown in VideoMAE pretraining and fine-tuning. There is plenty of redundancy, so they introduce dual-masking. The conclusion both show us that the efficiency of training video models can be further improved. Since the high-mask ratio reconstruction (90%~95% in the video) has told us the key of VideoMAE pre-training, which has been discussed very well, the further improvement in efficiency can be viewed as incremental, and such improvement has been shown in [2]. So, I would say the observation is not that novel as well.\n\n2. The significance is limited. Since this is an experimental-based paper. The significance mainly relied on the results or improvement over current state-of-the-art or strong baselines.  First, the performance is compared under a very short pre-training period in Table 1. I am concerned about this since, in the original paper, at least an 800-epoch training should be conducted for a fair comparison. Second, When measuring the wall-clock time memory consumption to show efficiency, different devices are used.  To make an accurate claim, I believe they should be benchmarked on the same device.  Finally,  the proposed method only achieved comparable performance under limited budgets, so \"state-of-the-art\" performance should be carefully used in the abstract. \n\n\n3. The presentation can be improved. The ablation study is disorganized since the author uses different datasets and different models, even different devices. I would see a clear ablation for the proposed method is needed for better presentation.  In Table 1, I can not understand the comparison of the computations saving since it only happened when compared with VideoMAE.   I cannot understand Table 3-5 as well since there is insufficient consistency in the author's experiments.\n\n[1] Park, Seong Hyeon, et al. \"K-centered patch sampling for efficient video recognition.\" European Conference on Computer Vision.
