The authors introduce a patch reconstruction task that autoencodes each patch without considering other patches and a patch-wise MLP architecture for embedding. They also incorporate complementary contrastive learning to efficiently capture adjacent time series information. Experimental results demonstrate that their proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art Transformer-based models in time series forecasting and classification tasks while being more efficient in terms of parameters and training time."

They demonstrate that using an MLP as the PI architecture in MTM can independently reconstruct unmasked patches while disregarding interactions between patches, thereby improving efficiency while reducing the parameter count. Simultaneously, it has been shown that introducing complementary contrastive learning effectively captures information from adjacent time series. The model has been tested on two downstream tasks: time series forecasting and classification, demonstrating significant advantages in terms of performance, architectural interpretability, and robustness."
