The small model is learned via MLE and the black box model EBM interpretation is used to sample from it. To probabilistically adopt the pre trained black-box model to new data, the denoising prediction is changed to the sum of predictions from both the black-box pre-trained model and the task-specific small model. The combined model is further refined by MCMC sampling. \n The authors show successful experiments on controlled video generation, egocentric videos, and realistic robotic videos from simulation."

This innovative approach, inspired by the prompting mechanism in large language models, uses the score function of a pretrained video diffusion model as a probabilistic prior, guiding the generation of a smaller, task-specific video model. Remarkably, this smaller model, with only 1.25% of the parameters of the original, can generate high-quality and domain-specific videos across diverse applications. The authors advocate for private enterprises to provide access to the scores of video diffusion models, enhancing the adaptability of large pretrained text-to-video models, with video demos available in the supplementary material."

Currently the paper highlights the ability of adapting black-box pretrained large text-video model. However, it relaxes the assumption of obtaining intermediate generation results of the black-box model, which is not realistic, and even contradicts with the term \"black-box\". It is really inappropriate to just use an existing term in a completely different setting.\n\nb. The current manuscript also highlights parameter efficiency. However, the current evidence is not enough to really claim this. There has been some many parameter efficient fine-tuning techniques and the comparison with such existing method is really needed to claim superiority from this part. Specifically, comparisons with LoRA and other SOTA PEFT methods should be at least provided to help the audience really know the performance of existing methods.\n\nc. The current setup is actually not that highlighting efficiency. The largest small model can even take half of the computation of the large model. It would be much more rigorous if the authors can set a computation budget and compare methods under a fixed budget.\n\n2. Evaluation of the video generation. From qualitative inspect, I don't really think Video Adapter in Figure 8 is really better. Is there any case study further examining the human preference and the score obtained from automatic evaluation, especially on datasets like Ego4D?"
