                "value": "Authors study the generalization ability of different Temporal Graph Learning (TGL) algorithms including GNN-based, RNN-based, and memory-based methods, under the finite-wide over-parameterized regime. To this end, they provide a unified framework for these algorithms and bound their generalization error measured by means of the {0,1}-loss. Their bound, explicited in Theorem 1, emphasizes mainly the dependencies of the generalization error to the number of layers/steps and the feature-label alignment (FLA) score. These motivate the use of shallow and non-recursive networks operating on properly shaped input data instead of depending on memory components. De facto, authors introduce a novel model coined SToNe that fits to these principles. Then they show that SToNE achieves highly competitive performances on link prediction tasks in transductive and inductive settings, with considerably less parameters and better running times."

I think the discussion of the existing generalized bounds for GNN and so on should be elaborated on more in the literature review part and the comparison with the novel bound derived in this paper should be provided. \n2. The definition of FLA depends on the gradient of $f$ with respect to $\\theta$. However, the ReLU networks are non-smooth, which may make FLA undefinable. \n3. In the statement of Theorem 1, when $\\theta_0$ is randomly initialized, $R$ should be a random variable. It is vague to compare two random variables in the result in theorem 1.\n4. Based on your findings, SToNe outperforms other methods due to its smaller FLA and thus smaller generalization bound. I am curious about the comparison of FLA of the different methods in those real datasets. The current experiments to illustrate the effect of FLA are all on SToNe itself.\n\nThe following are some questions in the proofs.\n\n5. The proof of lemma 5 relies on the upper bound of $\\|\\partial loss_i(\\theta)/\\partial W^{(l)}\\|$ for $\\theta$ from the iteration of SGD. This upper bound is obtained in lemma 4, which is built on lemma 8 from Zhu et al. (2022). However, in that paper, they assumed that $W$ is a guassian random matrix, which is different in this paper (note that in this case, $W$ is obtained from SGD). Hence, i don't think that lemma can be applied here and there are some flaws in upper bounding $\\|\\partial loss_i(\\theta)/\\partial W^{(l)}\\|$.\n6. In the proof of Theorem 2, the part of constructing $f'\\in \\mathcal{F}(\\theta_0,R)$ such that $\\psi$ can be upper bounded by $1/\\sqrt{N}$ is confusing (e.g., why $\\langle \\nabla_\\theta f_i(\\theta_0),\\theta \\rangle =y_i(B+B')$). I can't get the point how $R$ can make a difference in the result.\n\nI would appreciate it if you can clear my concerns."

While multiple methods have been proposed, there is not yet a good understanding of when or why certain methods outperform others, in particular in terms of how well they predict temporal interactions between nodes in the future. This lack of understanding is something this manuscript aims to address by establishing an upper bound for the expected error in predictions in various proposed temporal graph learning frameworks. In particular this upper bound depends (in an increasing way) on the number of layers in the GNN and RNN based methods, the Lipschitz constant of the activation function in the memory based method, and the feature-label alignment score (FLA) in all considered methods.\nThis is taken as guiding principle to propose a new method with few layers and small FLA, the latter of which is achieved by a selection of some of the most recent interactions as input data. The proposed new method is shown to behave well (i.e. comparatively or better) in terms of generalizability as well as FLA and running time compared to methods from previous literature."
