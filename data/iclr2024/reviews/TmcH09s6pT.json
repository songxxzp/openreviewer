The study reveals that when a generalized neural collapse phenomenon occurs, one-vs-rest margins is maximized. The authors provide theoretical studies for CE loss with diminishing temperate, and under some assumptions show that the optimal solutions satisfy NC1 to NC3. The authors conduct experiments to verify the theory, and propose the method of class-mean features (CMF) classifiers to reduce training memory cost."

                "value": "1. I still have concerns on the justifications for using a small temperature. The authors cite two papers [1,2] to support their claim. I am not convinced this is a general practice for the majority of works in this field. Also, I cannot find the exact number of $\\tau=1/30$ in [1] claimed by the authors. In [2], the chosen loss function is negative cosine similarity, and I can not see how this is connected with CE with small temperature. Furthermore, I think considering only the diminishing temperature case oversimplifies the problem, since in this case, the problem intrinsically has a max-margin structure which aligns well with the desired NC properties. However, I cannot see why this is also true for general CE loss functions.\n2. For GNC3, it is required that the Tammes problem and softmax codes are equivalent. The authors show that this is true for trivial setting, and conjecture it to be true for other settings. Since their separation metrics are quite different, I am not convinced that these two configurations are equivalent. As the experiments tricks in Section 5 are grounded on GNC3, I recommend the authors to make more clarifications on this matter. \n3. In the related works part, the authors claim that two of the related paper focuses on networks with weight decay, which is not required in this paper. However, this paper assumes that the weight and feature vectors have unit length, which is stronger than the assumptions of using weight decay. Therefore, I can not see why this makes a big distinction.\n\n[1] Hao Wang, Yitong Wang, Zheng Zhou, Xing Ji, Dihong Gong, Jingchao Zhou, Zhifeng Li, and Wei Liu.

The contribution of this work undoubtedly broadens the research horizon and is sufficiently significant for acceptance. In the current ICLR submission, while the core content remains largely unchanged, some questions I raised during the NeurIPS 2023 preview process have been addressed, and certain revisions have been implemented in this submission. Consequently, my review remains consistent with my previous assessment."

Empirically, they demonstrate that property (ii) holds and property (i) holds for small enough temperature parameter on the CE loss. They also show that small temperature leads to good generalization. On theory front, the authors confirm the formalization by studying the corresponding UFM with temperature tending to zero.

Can you please comment on that?\n\nIn addition to GNC2 metric, is it not possible to track a metric that more accurately captures the geometry? Eg. angles between classifiers. At least for cases that you know the geometry of Ws like K<2d?\n\nThe last subfigure in Fig 2 shows that generalization performance improves with decreasing temperature. Could you please comment on whether the best value achieved is also on par with the sota value for CE training without normalization and temperature scaling (which I believe is the \"standard\" practice?)\n\nPS: In general, I enjoyed reading the paper and the results.
