In the last sentence of the paper as a future work, could considering the continuous action space make the problem completely different (or some minor differences?)  \n\n- I\u2019m not sure why the global map interrupts the performance (as pointed out in Table 1). Could you give some additional insights? In my feeling, as the obstacles seem to be fixed (not dynamic), the global map could help the task from the macroscopic viewpoint. However, for example, the training to consider the map seems challenging.\n\n- What is the effect of spraying points? In Fig. 5, they seem to be derived from segmentation results. Any connections between the spraying points and obstacles (Bio?). Are all instances similar as illustrated in Fig.5, or are they completely different?\n\n- Some minor comments:\n    - Quick question: how did the authors design A* and D* for the problem? It is interesting if the authors give some details because, in my feeling, I\u2019m not convinced that A* is time-consuming, as Table 2 says when the obstacle information is explicitly given. (Possibly, I misunderstood some settings).\n    - Just a small question: what is an intuitive explanation or visualization of synthetic cases? (in real UAV datasets can be understood through Fig.5).\n    - Time limit in Fig. 2 (denoted by $T$), but in the optimization problem, it seems to be $L$.\n\n~~~~\n\n- After the response, some of the above questions have been clarified, and therefore my score was updated."

The overall assumptions thus seem sound to me.\n- Ablations of some of the assumptions are included.\n- The paper was easy to follow, with some room for improvement in terms of the level of detail (see below).\n\n[1] W.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- I see the joint training of the transformer and the network that predicts directions as the main contribution. What I am missing in that regard is an ablation of whether this actually works better than training both components in isolation. Right now it is hard to tell whether the routing patterns are really influenced meaningfully by the path-planning constraints. In that sense, I think the paper would be stronger if it considers a baseline where a routing-only transformer is pretrained like in prior art, and then a direction-prediction network is fit to its predicted goals post-mortem.\n- Related to the above, the paper would benefit from representative examples of what navigation runs look like, right now these are virtually missing (there is only one pesticide spraying example). This makes it hard to judge how well the routing and obstacle avoidance work together. Particularly because the considered environments are not that complex.\n- The overall idea to use a transformer for routing is directly carried over from prior art (e.g. [1]), one can easily tell by the used notation. Still, most of section 4 is about the transformer design. To count this as a contribution, I find the following points important:\n    - The ablation of the transformer (top 2 rows of table 1) is very important, to justify any changes in architecture.\n    - It appears that the traditional transformer baseline performs quite well in comparison, which makes me question whether the proposed layer structure (cross-attention, etc.) is really necessary.\n    - It is argued that the traditional transformer's success rate is lower because obstacles are not encoded in its embeddings. I don't see why this has to be, can't one provide both the list of waypoints and obstacles as one long vector input? And respectively rely on a more generic architecture, like in [1]?\n- The direction-prediction net uses info only from the local neighborhood of the agent (based on figure 4). This makes the path-planning greedy, which may work reasonably in the considered experiments, but I doubt it will be optimal in something like apartment layouts or mazes. This should be highlighted as a limitation.\n- In terms of the runtime experiments: is the reported runtime of 3.5ms for one forward pass, or for predicting the whole set of goal waypoints + direction actions? It seems like the reported numbers for the traditional methods are for solving the whole problem.\n- Some minor points: presentation-wise, while I appreciate the transparency in the network diagrams, I find these are better suited for an appendix, the information in them could be distilled. I also found the equations in sec. 3 somewhat too verbose, given that they are not used at all in the implementation (e.g. the transformer uses masking to implement most of the constraints).\n\nIn summary, I believe the experiments should be more focused on proving that the joint training of the transformer and the path planning network is beneficial, as this appears to be the primary novelty of the research. This and the other issues listed above are currently holding me back. The transformer network itself and the associated runtime benefits were already established in prior works, so I wouldn't count these as novel contributions of this paper.\n\nEdit: slightly improving my score, as some of the above points are clearer after the review responses. As requested, the authors reacted to the first two points above.\n\n[1] W. Kool and H. van Hoof and M. Welling, Attention, Learn to Solve Routing Problems! ICLR 2019"

Often A* heuristics happen to be admissible (e.g. in point-to-point navigation like in the paper), which still returns optimal solutions. Would you consider adjusting this? This is also related to my comment about picking directions greedily in the weaknesses section."
