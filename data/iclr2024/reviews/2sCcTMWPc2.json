                "value": "This paper proposes TimelyGPT, a new transformer architecture for long-time series representation and modeling. For the embedding, xPOS embedding segments long sequences and uses exponential decay based on relative distances to enable extrapolation. For the representation, recurrent attention retention mechanism models global context by integrating short and long-term memory; convolution modules applied on inputs (tokenizer) and hidden states capture local interactions; and ecoder-only autoregressive design allows generating representations for future unseen timesteps. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of TimelyGPT in modeling both continuously monitored biosignal data and irregularly-sampled time-series data, which are common in longitudinal electronic health records. They advocate for a shift in time-series deep learning research from small-scale modeling from scratch to large-scale pre-training."

Task specific pre-training deviates from the foundational model paradigm, why was that done?\n\nFigure 3.a results look almost too good to be true, 720 vs 6K prediction window size is a huge difference and one would expect at least some performance decay. At what prediction window size do you start seeing performance decay and what in TimelyGPT makes it so well suited for such long range prediction?\n\nSome components like the temporal convolution module have very specific sets of operators.

                "value": "- As mentioned in Section 1, it is suggested that *\"challenges observed in small-scale time series might stem from overfitting limited data rather than inherent flaws in transformers\"*. This statement is a bit confusing as the title suggests that the model can handle long time series. However, it seems that the goal is to address the overfitting to limited data, which implies that only short-time series are available. This appears to be contradictory. Please clarify what problems in time series applications are mainly addressed here. \n\n- Table 1 can be further improved. For example, it is unclear what is meant by 'data size.' Is it the number of time points or the number of windows? And what are the numbers of the proposed model? \n\n- The writing could be further improved. The formulas in section 3.2 are difficult to follow, and it would be helpful to introduce each formula one by one in a logical manner.\n\n- The proposed TimelyGPT refers to the Timely Generative *Pre-trained* Transformer. However, details of the *pretraining* and fine-tuning processes are missing. Specifically, what datasets and how many epochs were used for pretraining? What fine-tuning strategies were used for downstream tasks? \n\n- There are many related works (e.g., TS2Vec, TimesNet) on time series self-supervised representation learning, but there is a lack of systematic investigation, discussion, and comparison. \n\n- Regarding the prediction results in Figure 3, it should be noted that the dataset is not commonly used for forecasting. \nAdditionally, a too-long prediction horizon may not make sense as real-world prediction scenarios are usually dynamic and unpredictable.\n\n- It is recommended to summarize the prediction results in a table rather than an overly simplified figure. This makes it easier for other works to follow.\n\n- Visualization results are encouraged to be included.\n\n- The use of a relative position embedding is not a new idea and it has been studied in different communities, e.g., transformer variants and time series applications. For example, \n> [ref] STTRE: A Spatio-Temporal Transformer with Relative Embeddings for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting  \n[ref] Improve transformer models with better relative position embeddings\n\n- If the proposed recurrent attention can handle irregular time series well, it would be beneficial to compare it with popular irregular time series methods. \n> [ref] Multi-time attention networks for irregularly sampled time series\n\n- The source code is incomplete."
