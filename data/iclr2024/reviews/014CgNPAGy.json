The authors borrow the $O(\\eta)$-close continuous flow approximation for momentum from Kovachki and Stuart and use it to derive the continuous flow for the diaognal linear network. Then they conclude that the modified hyperbolic entropy potentital they find with solving this second order differential equation has a smaller initialization scale. This initialization becomes more small as the accumulation of norm of gradients increase and as the momentum parameter ($\\mu$) increase. A standard technique to analyze the implicit bias in such simple networks is the scale of initialization (smaller the richer) which controls the transition from rich to kernel regime (Woodsworth et al). Several works show that SGD and finite step-size also decrease this scale of initialization. And in this paper, the authors try to make an incremental contribution to show that momentum also does the same."

                "value": "The paper has serious novelty issues and technical issues. The authors seem to be not aware of the paper [1] which already analyzed the implicit regularization for momentum in deep learning models. In my opinion, the theorem from the paper can be extended to diagonal networks with calcualtions (with almost the same conclusion as theirs). Additionaly the consideration of continuous time approximation for HB and NAG has some technical concerns which I will discuss. \n\n**1) Major novelty issues**\n\nIn page-3, the authors claim \"Compared to previous works, we develop the continuous time approximations of HB and NAG\nfor deep learning models, **which is still missing in current literature**, and we focus on the implicit\nbias of HB and NAG rather than GD\". This statement is False and the paper [1] already analyzed the implicit regularization of momentum through continuous (and modified)  time approximations of HB and NAG for deep learning models. It's unfortunate that the authors were not aware of the work. They [1] do it in a more general setting (not restricted to diagonal networks). This general setting can be also extened to diagonal linear networks with the conclusion unchanged. \n\n**2) A simple extension to the results of [1] may lead to the same conlcusion as this paper**\n\nConsider the theorem 4.1 in [1] which proposes an  $O(\\eta^2)$ continuous approximation (as opposed to a weaker O(\\eta) approximation in this paper ) to the discrete H.B updates. In this case, the implicit regularization is of the form of the norm of the gradients $\\frac{(1+\\mu)\\eta}{4(1-\\mu)^3}|| L(w)||^2$, which promotes flatter sub-trajectories than gradient descent modified flow (which is only $\\frac{\\eta}{4}|| L(w)||^2$ ). For diagonal linear networks, this regularizer can be explicitly calcualted to be $|| \\hat{X}^T r(t) \\circ w(t)||^2$ where $w=[u,v]$ according to . I am directly borrowing equation-15 from page-20 in Woodsworth et al, which I feel the authors would be familair with. Now this regularization term  $|| \\hat{X}^T r(t) \\circ w(t)||^2$ may lead to a form of weighted weight-decay on the factors and it is well known that weight decay on the factors u and v promote sparseness (or minimizes the l1 norm of reconstruction of $\\beta$). And this regularization increases with momentum and vanishes for very small step-size (these two are the two main conclusions from this paper). In simpler words, **sparser solutions correspond to the flatter solutions for the diagonal linear networks (see Section 5.2 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07011.pdf) and [1] already showed that momentum drives trajectories to flatter minimas and this effect vanishes with learning rate tending to 0**. \n\n**3) Major technical concern**\n\nThe authors claim \"Proposition 1 is an application of Theorem 3 of Kovachki & Stuart (2021) and we present an\nalternative proof in Appendix B\" where **infact they use exactly Theorem-4 (without any modfiication)**  from Kovachki & Stuart (2021) . Additionally while stating such approximating continuous flows it is very important to mention how much it deviates from the true discrete trajectory (which the original theorem mentions). In this case, the deviation of the approximating continuous flow and the discrete trajectory is order $O(\\eta)$ [Theorem 4 in Kovachki & Stuart (2021)]. The problem arises because the authors **do not find the implicit bias of HB and NAG but instead for an approximate continuos version which is $O(\\eta)$**. This is problematic because mostly in the paper authors refer to this as \"implicit bias of HB and NAG\" but it is not. Note that for large time T, this two trajectories deviate as the hidden coefficeint for the $O(\\eta)$ is exponential on time. Two questions and discussion can form from this:\n\n*A) Existing works on diagonal linear networks already use continuous version of GD, so why not momentum?*\n\nThis is because, the existing works are explicitly for gradient flow and not on gradient descent. The analysis for gradient descent varies largely from those of gradient flow. So, in this current work the implicit bias found is for an $O(\\eta)$-approximate continuous version of HB or NAG (and not for HB or NAG)\n\n*B) Why not use an $O(\\eta^2)$ continuous approximation for HB?*\n\nIf the authors consider the $O(\\eta)$-continuous flow as a good approximation for HB,NAG (which it is not), then Theorem-7 in Kovachki and Stuart is more suitable candidate for analysis of HB and NAG. This is because this modified flow is  $O(\\eta^2)$ to the trajectory of HB and NAG whereas the continous flow considered is only $O(\\eta)$ close. The analysis would also be easier due to the use of first order ODE instead of second order ODE. See point 2 above for details on this. \n\n**4) Observations from section 3.3 is already done in [1]**\n\nThe implicit bias for learning rate tending to 0 will lead to similar regurlaizations as GF and this approximate momentum flow is already made in [1] with theorems and experiments. \n\n**5) Missing insights in terms of convergence and saddle to saddle jump issue**\n\n Momentum is well know to accelerate convergence (the re-sclaed gradient demonstrates that obviously), however the authors claim that momentum will have an effect of smaller effective initializationl. In the class of problems considering incremental learning (diagonal linear networks and matrix sensing), it is well known about the tension between saddle escape time and generalization, smaller initialziation improves generalziation but leads to larger saddle escape time. Does the effective smaller intiialization also increase the saddle escape time ? This is contradictory to the assumption that momentum has faster convergence. The current analysis did not provide any insight. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Avrajit Ghosh, He Lyu, Xitong Zhang, and Rongrong Wang.

Secondly, it uncovers that the implicit bias introduced by momentum is dependent on the gradient initialization, a factor that may not necessarily improve generalization.

I strongly suggest the authors discuss the correlation and difference between this paper and the mentioned existing works.\n\n2. **Difference between GD and HB/NAG**: The difference of implicit bias between GD and HB/NAG is still not clear to me. For example, if the $\\theta^TR$ term is discarded, isn't the implicit bias of HB/NAG always achieved by GD with a  smaller initialization scale? If that is true, I think it is not proper to say HB/NAG has a better implicit bias than GD, since it seems GD contains as same (if not richer) range of implicit bias as HB/NAG .\n\n3. In the sentence under the second formula in page 7, if letting $\\mu=0$, $R$ will equal to $R^{GF}$, which further equals to $0$, right? But I failed to show $R=0$ when $\\mu=0$? \n\n4.

In the approach followed by the paper it is not clear what is the order of approximation of the result (the theorem does not even state that it is an approximate result).
