                "value": "Pretrained protein language models trained on protein residue sequences have become useful primitives in bioinformatics, as, much like their cousins in NLP, they can easily achieve good performance on diverse downstream tasks. In this paper, the authors train a protein language model on sequences of residue tokens augmented with VQ-VAE tokens encoding each protein's structure (or, lacking that, the AlphaFold2 prediction of its structure). Compared to traditional PLMs, the structure-aware language model performs better on a large suite of protein-related tasks."

Beyond structural biology, I think this paper is also a nice addition to the literature on multimodal language modeling."

As a simple way to incorporate structural information, SaProt leverages Foldseek, a recent approach to translate 3D structures into token sequences. Comparing with approaches from prior work, SaProt performs stronger on a range of protein function prediction tasks. Analysis supports the conclusion that it is the structural information that leads the model to outperform approaches such as ESM from prior work that include only sequence information."

Since one of the core contributions is the proposed vocabulary, it would have been helpful to see more analysis on the various choices involved (see questions below).\n* The presentation of the paper could be improved in several places. For example, section 3.1 seemed to distract from the presentation of SaProt and would be perhaps better presented as additional analysis later in the paper. Using MLM loss across the three modeling approaches did not seem like a clear comparison, given the differences in model architectures and inputs. Additionally, the connection between these findings and the design choices of SaProt was not clear. Additionally, in section 3.3.2, it may be clearer to present just strategy 2 and then the ablation comparison with strategy 1 later. These recommendations would simplify section 3 and the exposition of SaProt.\n* With the availability of AlphaFoldDB and Foldseek, leveraging these resources to incorporate structural information into Transformer-based PLMs is a somewhat straightforward step, and prior work has done this, e.g. ProstT5. ProstT5 is a relatively recent preprint, but I'm glad the authors acknowledged this work. However, while experiments show that SaProt outperforms ProstT5, it didn't seem clear to dismiss this work as not a \"general-purpose PLM\". Regardless, it seems that the main contribution of this work is not in the novelty of approach, but in the empirical results."
