                "value": "This paper introduces a novel machine unlearning method, Stackelberg game (SG) unlearning, which integrates membership inference attack (MIA) into the unlearning algorithms. Specifically, the MIA strives to distinguish forget samples from test samples using outputs generated by the unlearned model. Conversely, the primary objective of the unlearned model is to confound the MIA's attempts to make such distinctions. Then, implicit function theorem is leveraged to solve the SG unlearning with gradient-based solution that fits into end-to-end pipelines. Experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 show the effectiveness of the proposed SG unlearning method.\n\nThe main contribution is that this work proposes to integrate MIA into the design of unlearning, offers a refreshing adversarial perspective to the realm of machine unlearning."

Do the stationarity conditions account fo $\\nabla V(\\tilde{D}_{\\theta_u}^{tr}; \\theta_a^{'})$? It would enhance comprehension if the complete equation for $f$ were explicitly presented.\n\n- The manuscript could benefit from more meticulous notation for clarity.\n    - In Eq.(4), should $D_{\\theta_u}$ actually be $D_{\\theta_u}^{val}$? Alternatively, is it meant to be $\\tilde{D}_{\\theta_u}^{tr}$?\n    - In Section 5, when referencing $n$ as indicative of size, is this referring to the size of the attack model parameters?\n    - For example, in Section 3, $i$ in $(x_i, y_i)$ denotes the indices, it might be more clear to use $(x_j^f, x_j^f)$ rather than $(x_f^j, x_f^j)$.\n\n- Missing details in the experiments and unconvincing results.\n    - All experiments only consider the setting where the forget set is randomly selected, accounting for 10% of the training data, and only employs ResNet-18. A broader set of conditions (e.g., 20% forget set, class-specific forgets, poisoned sample forgets, and varying network architectures) would have enriched the analysis.\n    -  What number of epochs is used for the retrained models? And what additional computational overhead does the MIA introduce? It would have been better if these could be provided to show the efficiency.\n    - How does the unscrubbed model perform? Also, results in tables for method like FF and IU fail to unlearn, how these methods perform with increased noise level?\n    - Considering the MIA is already integrated into the unlearning algorithm, KS and MIA metrics is quite related to the performance of MIA. Incorporating common metrics like Weight Distance [1], Activation Distance [2-3], Relearn Time [4] and Epistemic Uncertainty [5] might offer a more holistic performance view.\n    - Besides, it would be better if the loss/accuracy curve (from the retrained model and the proposed method) could be provided to show the convergence.\n    - The literature review appears to overlook some recent developments in the field (e.g., [5-8]). It would strengthen the paper's comparative analysis if at least one contemporary method were included for benchmarking.\n    - Minor: FT seems achieve the best test acc. in tables.\n\n[1] Tarun, Ayush K., et al. \"Fast yet effective machine unlearning.\" IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (2023).\n\n[2] Chundawat, Vikram S., et al. \"Can bad teaching induce forgetting? unlearning in deep networks using an incompetent teacher.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

This enables more efficient and effective optimization of unlearning, making it amenable to end-to-end pipelines."

This should goes back to the objective of machine unlearning. The objective of machine unlearning is to to negate a subset of data\u2019s influence on the model. The goal should be maintaining a high performance of the model while erasing the imprint of the data from the model. Hence, if I understand it correctly, the performance should be as high as possible regardless of the retraining performance as long as the effectiveness of the unlearning is acceptable.\n\n2. The authors consider the setting where the forget set is randomly sampled. First, It is not clear to me why this assumption will hold in real-world scenario when the machine unlearning is motivated by regulations in certain geographical regions. Second, if the forget set is randomly sampled, from a statistical point of view, the problem of machine unlearning becomes the problem of understanding how training dataset size can affect the model performance (the difference between the original performance and the retraining performance). \n\n3. In the empirical results, the authors only demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework. The missing piece is the effectiveness of the proposed gradient-based method. It seems that the paper is lack of demonstration on which point the gradient-based method is converging to. For example, how the utilities of both players evolve during the training process? And which solution concept the algorithm is converging to if it is converging?"
