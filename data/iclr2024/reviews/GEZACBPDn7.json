How do $d$ and $d\u2019$ as well as $d\u2019\u2019$ influence the classification accuracy?\n3. What are the numbers of layers in the two GNNs in the experiments? Does the depth matter?\n4. In Figure 2, the two post-processing methods for the global kernel matrix are compared. It seems that the one related to $c$ is better than the one related to $\\tau$. I wonder if the authors reported the results of the method related to $c$ in Tables 2, 3, and \n5. It is not clear why the authors did not include the results of larger labeling rates such as 30% or 50%.\n6. Are their any time cost comparison?\n7. In Table 4, it seems that the performance of graphlet sampling kernel is always the worst. I suggest the authors discuss the difference between graphlet sampling kernel and other kernels.\n8. It is necessary to compare the number of hyperperameters of the proposed method with those of the baselines. In the proposed method, one has to determine $c$ or $\\tau$, which affect the classification performance."
