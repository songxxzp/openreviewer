Traditional bandit algorithms lack prior knowledge and can be computationally intensive. Although transfer learning techniques, which utilize knowledge from related tasks, are applied, they often encounter the problem of biased learned strategies due to incomplete information transfer from experts to agents. To address these issues, the authors introduce novel causal bounds for TLPOCB tasks and develop algorithms that improve learning efficiency."

Further, it seems that table next Table 1 does not have a proper caption. Increase arraystretch to represent table better.\n- The organization near Eq 5 and 6 are awkward. \n- BTW, lines 1,3,4,6 could be one-liner and Fig 1 can be a lot smaller to afford more space\u2026 \n- There are many pointers to Appendix which somewhat distracts the flow.\n- I suggest Causal Bounds as a separate section and use subsection/paragraph properly. Causal bounds can be described irrelevant to the transfer learning problem. Current paragraphs \u201cCausal Bounds\u201d and \u201cSampling valid causal models\u201d as a whole can be in the section and can be restructured. \n- In Page 8 near at the end, I don\u2019t get the argument here about instrumental variables. If they rely on IV, you may argue that your method is free of IV requirement. It is a bit unnecessary to mention that finding IV is an open problem in academia (Economics?).  \n- adjust the two plots in Figure 2\n\nBy the way, this paper would be more like for AISTATS, CLeaR (causal conference), NeurIPS, ICML ... I wonder why the authors pick the ICLR as the 'best' revenue to present the results. I don't see any part 'representation learning' involved.
