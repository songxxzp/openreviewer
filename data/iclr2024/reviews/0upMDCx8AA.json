                "value": "This paper studies alleviation of spurious correlation caused by the bias in the data.\nIt proposes a fine-tuning framework to address such bias. Their approach leverages the idea of Influence Function (IF) to identify bias-conflicting samples. Specifically, by compute Self-Influence (SI), which measures a sample\u2019s influence on the accuracy of itself, the framework can reveal data that hinder model generalization. \n\nHowever, such a direct application of SI might not generate sufficient samples. Thus the paper further introduces bias-customized self-influence (BCSI), which effectively identifies bias-conflicting samples, with higher BCSI scores indicating pronounced conflicts with bias. They then create a pivotal subset that minimizes spurious correlations by considering BCSI scores of the training samples. Following this, fine-tuning of a biased model through a limited number of iterations is implemented using the selected subset of data, reducing injected bias. Experimental results show that the proposed method manifests effectiveness in low-bias scenarios."

                "value": "**1**.  Unclear definition in section 2.1: what is $s_y$ and $b_y$? \nDoes it indicate for a single class $y$, there can only be one relevant signal $s$, which is $s_y$, and only one irrelevant signal $b$, which is denoted as $b_y$? If yes, this seems to be the most extreme case of spurious correlation, i.e., the spurious correlation equals 1 for all class $y \\in [C]$.\nOr does it indicate that, for a single class, there can be one and only one spurious attribute? I.e., one class cannot be correlated with two spurious attributes?\n\n**2**. In Figure 1, are the reported accuracies the validation accuracy measured on a validation set? \n\n**3**. Figure 1(a), the pattern confused me. It seems that the precision is not monotonic w.r.t. The bias-conflicting sample ratio. Although the curve corresponding to 0.5% is at the top, the curve for 5% is above that of 1% and 2%. This makes me confused about the implication of this specific result and worried whether it is due to noise. It might be helpful to show the results averaged over multiple runs.\n\n**4**. When the paper validated the proposed BCSI, it mentioned \u201cIn Figure 1(b), our approach exhibits consistent detection precision compared to conventional SI\u201d. Could I ask why Figure 1(b) manifests \u201cconsistent detection\u201d? It seems to be a large variation of range across bias ratios. I am confused.\n\n**5**. From Figure 1e-1h, it seems that BCSI consistently outperformed others except for the extreme 0.5% case.\n\n**6**. Regarding the last two paragraphs of Section 3.2: the paper claims that a drawback of many existing methods is that they cannot handle the setting with a lack of biased samples. To address this concern, the proposed solution is to add a simple cross entropy loss to the final loss function. My concern is, I did not see how this is novel compared to the existing methods. First, why cannot the previous methods also add a CE loss when the biased samples are lacking? Second, I am not convinced why adding a CE loss helps. When the pivotal set is small, isn\u2019t it true that adding a randomly sample CE loss have close effect to ERM?"

Section 3.1 is supposed to explain why self influence does not work in biased data, but it is not clear first how it is applied in biased data, and then why it does not work and needs to be modified. As far as I can tell, Figure 1 only shows modified SI (which is not yet introduced in the paper till Section 3.1) outperforms SI but does not explain the fundamental reason of this outperformance. \n2. The novelty of the proposed algorithm with respect to self-influence functions is not well-explained. Why training five epochs using GCE (what is GCE by the way ? ) and then using self influence function works but fully trained model does not ?
