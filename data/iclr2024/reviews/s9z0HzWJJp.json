                "value": "This work tries to propose an open-ended lifelong learning environment designed for developing autonomous agents that can perform human-like and up-to-date analysis and decision-making on societal topics. To do so, the environment SocioDojo is structured to emulate the historical development of society using real-world texts and time series data. \n\nSpecifically, it 1) integrates a continuous stream of real-world texts and messages from various information sources, including news, social media, reports, and more. The information in the form of time-stamped messages, ensures that the agents are exposed to up-to-date societal developments, forcing them to analyze and respond to fresh data.\n2) incorporates a vast array of time series data spanning various societal aspects like finance, economics, politics, and social trends.\n3) incorporates multiple knowledge bases and tools, including books, journals,  encyclopedias, interfaces to search engines and knowledge graphs, etc.\n\nWith the environment, the task of the agent is called \"Hyperportfolio Task\". They are given an initial \"cash\" value and are tasked with making \"investments\" in different \"assets\" that correspond to various time series. The goal is to maximize their total assets over a specified period, just like investment and asset management in the real world.\n\nIn this work, the author also proposes the Analyst-Assistant-Actuator agent architecture to tackle the hyperportfolio task, and the Hypothesis and proof prompting technique for generating high-quality analysis, which achieves improvements of 32.4% and 30.4% in two experiment settings compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The ablation study results show 1)the importance of domain-specific analysis techniques and high-quality information sources. 2)The analyst is critical for the hyperportfolio task."

Such as the prohibition of \"day trading\"  ensures that agents don't exploit short-term fluctuations but instead focus on understanding and predicting more meaningful, long-term societal trends. \n\nOverall, I do believe the complexity of the hyperportfolio task could set a high bar for LLM-based agents, challenging the community to rise to the occasion."

These could serve as short-term goals or benchmarks, allowing researchers to run and evaluate their own model in a phased manner. It could also be useful for evaluating the information coverage level of the system.\n\nThe lower bound of the system is not clear. The complexity of SocioDojo might inadvertently obscure the foundational or simpler strategies that also be effective. For instance, SOTA time-series forecasting methods could be employed as a foundational strategy for investment within the SocioDojo environment. It could serve as a baseline or a lower bound against which more complex strategies can be compared.\n\nI also hope the author put more discussion on how the authors have addressed potential biases, screened sources, and ensured the diversity of data, it would bolster the paper's credibility and address potential concerns."

How is the final \u201creturn\u201d distributed across different time periods?\n4. For some of the time series, e.g. GDP as an economic time series, we would have existing forecasting beforehand. They might be part of the report, and the model can directly use these numbers, which are typically fairly accurate. In this case, how do you confirm that the agent utilizes the comprehensive information from different sources to make the \u201cinvestment\u201d instead of directly taking those numbers?\n5. Financial time series is typically the most noisy one compared with other time series, which should also be the least predictable. However, it is shown that the financial time series achieves the highest return. How do authors interpret such results?\n6. Typos: equation 3.1.2, Table 3.2.1 and Figure 3.2.1 are not pointing to the correct place and are not indexed correctly. Table 1 in the Knowledge Base part should be Table 2."
