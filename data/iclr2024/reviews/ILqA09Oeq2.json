Even though in the matrix case these two match, in random tensor problems there are different asymptotics for the two. It seems to me that authors are not dealing with info theoretical phase transitions but with numerical schemas: \"assume we do unfolding and apply the algorithm proposed, we find a solution in this regime\". Is this correct? \n\nIn a regime where SNR is high, authors mention that one can get good results with a simple tensor power iteration (no unfolding). What if we have a good enough guess for the initialization vector of the tensor power iteration? Are these two cases of any practical interest? \n\n\nWhile authors mention that coefficients c_i are positive and \"This models the fact that, in practice, we deal with large tensors whose dimensions have comparable sizes\", I wonder if it could help the paper to also highlight the (easier) cases where n_3 --> infty while others are constant etc. and provide intuitions on what each of these easier cases mean (many views of the problem makes it easy to identify signal). These simple cases may appear trivial from the viewpoint of the developed theory here, but some may be insightful / useful in practice to know about. \n\nFrom the plot it appears that the main bottleneck is the matrix SNR rho_M. Do we think that in practice (for the multiview clustering problem) it is relevant to consider the tensor formalism to get the bit of signal left in the tensor and get it back through unfolding?"
