            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The introduction section could benefit from further refinement to enhance clarity. It would be helpful if the central phenomenon driving the paper was elaborated upon more explicitly. For example, the relationship between Continual Learning as an inherently imbalanced problem and the role of Neural Collapse in addressing unbalanced data could be made clearer, especially in the context of new classes being biased towards the features of older classes. Specifically, the manuscript mentions: \u201cthe phenomenon in which the features of the new class become biased towards the features of the existing classes hinders fast convergence...\u201d It's commonly understood that this phenomenon might be observed even in the absence of a fixed simplex ETF classifier (and such forcing often results in forgetting). Could the authors clarify the unique aspects or potential novelty of their proposed solution in this context?\n\nThe reviewer appreciates the comprehensive coverage in the related work section. However, it might be more beneficial if the content closely aligns with the problem addressed in the paper. While the section provides a detailed list of papers on continual learning, drawing clearer connections to the main topic could enhance its relevance. For instance, the mention of 'task identity' appears to be introduced without prior context or its relationship to the paper's main theme. It might be helpful to either establish a connection with 'collapse' or consider refraining from introducing the 'task ID' without clear relevance.\n\nThe paper might benefit from considering additional related works to clarify its focus. Specifically, references regarding the fixed simplex ETF in continual learning could be further explored. For instance, a study introducing simplex fixed classifiers in Class Incremental Learning [2] found no significant improvement with respect to using  trainable classifiers. This has been further confirmed more recently in [8], and [3]. This result is also consistent with observations in [5, 4, 6, 7] regarding standard classification (i.e., no catastrophic forgetting). Some clarification in this regard on the key aspects that contribute to improving performance should be considered.\n\nThe section 4.1 asserting that Fixed Simplex ETF induces neural collapse may benefit from further elaboration, supplemented by relevant references or clear numerical evidence. Fixed Simplex ETF classifiers in unbalanced data regime are shown to prevent class prototypes from collapsing onto each other [9] but it doesn't necessarily lead to the neural collapse phenomenon as traditionally understood. The inspiration drawn from this observation should be more thoroughly verified.\n\nThe statement in the final paragraph of section 4.1 should be improved for clarity. The chain of implications is not clear: \u201ca maximum of d classifier vectors can be created for an ETF classifier\u201d. \u201cTherefore we define the ETF that does not require K\u201d. To the best understanding of the reviewer In a simplex ETF the number of class K and d seems to be related by K<=d+1. What does exactly mean that the ETF is not requiring K? Moreover is the simplex ETF a regular simplex o a simplex? It seems that near orthogonality. \n\nThe method of augmenting existing classes by rotating them into new classes is interesting. Further motivation might improve the novelty of this approach. It would be valuable for example to clarify the distinctions between this approach and the addition of a new dataset with its own labels.  Some further details about the relationship between rotation and neural collapse should be given. Furthermore, the section discussing the incremental preallocation of the simplex ETF would benefit from clearer referencing regarding its distinctions from [2].\n\nThe paper about residual correction should be discussed with respect to [1]. Additionally, an explanation for why this is expected to outperform the DNN model's direct predictions and the benefits of decoupling the contribution would be helpful.\n\nOverview: The proposed method encompasses several distinct components, giving it a somewhat fragmented impression. Additionally, some of the assertions made in the paper might benefit from more comprehensive evidence or explanations for clearer validation. It would also be advantageous to have a more thorough revision of the literature, ensuring that foundational works are adequately discussed and integrated.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Yu, Lu, et al. \"Semantic drift compensation for class-incremental learning.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2020.\n\n[2] Pernici, Federico, et al. \"Class-incremental learning with pre-allocated fixed classifiers.\" 2020 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR).
