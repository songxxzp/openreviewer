                "value": "1. The requirement of permutation invariance, as proposed by the authors, is questionable in time series analysis and may not be suitable for this domain. The authors argue that a density model should produce equivalent density values when the outputs are swapped, which is a reasonable expectation in the context of static generative models. However, in the time series setting, where the joint distribution of variables $y_1,...,y_K$ occurring at different time steps is considered, the presence of serial dependencies becomes crucial. Unfortunately, the permutation invariant requirement, which treats the order of data points as interchangeable, risks disrupting these vital temporal dependencies. In contrast, if the objective is to forecast the joint distribution of variables occurring at the same time step, the permutation invariant requirement might be deemed necessary. \n\n2. The rationale behind utilizing self-attention as the vector field in the proposed work is not clear. It seems redundant to introduce self-attention into the vector field, given that neural networks inherently possess permutation invariance properties with respect to the input. Therefore, a more explicit justification is needed to understand the motivation behind incorporating self-attention in this context. Moreover, it is worth noting that existing literature, such as [1], has already proposed the use of conditional normalizing flow models for forecasting the joint distribution of time series. Therefore, it is crucial to highlight the distinctions between the proposed work and the existing literature that necessitate the use of self-attention and the introduction of a more complex invertible self-attention mechanism.\n\n\n[1] Rasul, K., Sheikh, A.
