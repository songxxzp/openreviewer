Using this framework, the authors evaluate a wide range of different attribution methods on a variety of models and datasets, including CNNs and ViTs, as well as 2D, 3D, and point-cloud inputs. \n\nThe authors analyse and discuss their results and specifically aim to answer three questions they deem relevant in the context of attribution-based XAI methods, namely whether (1) attention-based attributions differ from 'classical' attribution methods, (2) whether the applicability of attribution methods depends on the modality, and (3) whether 'classical' methods still work for transformer models."

To achieve this, the authors adapt existing approaches and models to point-cloud and 3D volume inputs when necessary.\n\n**S2**: By making not only the code but various intermediate results publicly available (model weights, attribution maps, metric scores), the framework proposed by the authors allows for easily integrating additional evaluations, methods, and models. This is an important step to increase comparability and allow researchers to fairly test new XAI methods against existing approaches.\n\n**S3**: The experimental details are clearly described and code for reproducing the results has been made available."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the publicly available benchmark can surely prove useful to fellow researchers, I am hesitant to recommend the submission for acceptance for the following reasons.\n\n**W1**: In order to deal with the large number of metrics across multiple datasets, modalities, and models, the authors heavily summarise the results into the broad categories of _faithfulness_, _robustness_, and _complexity_. While this seemingly allows to 'zoom out', I am concerned that this effectively hides much of the complexity of the design choices involved and makes it difficult to understand what one can really deduce from the results. E.g., as the authors note, the _complexity_, which is supposed to be a proxy for the subjective 'human interpretability' of the attributions does not seem to actually coincide with the perceived complexity. What is the value of this measure then? How do we know that the same is not true for faithfulness (see also W2)?\n\n**W2**: For every subcategory, the authors essentially treat all metrics as being equally relevant and adequate for measuring, e.g. _faithfulness_. However, it is unclear to me whether it is meaningful to summarise these metrics into a single score, as each of them measure a different aspect of the models and define 'faithfulness' differently. This can also be observed in Fig. 9 in the appendix, as the different metrics for faithfulness do not seem to exhibit a reliable and general trend (compare, e.g., monotonicity and deletion). Further, they are sometimes based on assumptions that might not hold for a given model. E.g., models might be differently robust to pixel insertion or deletion and it is thus unclear whether these metrics measure aspects of the _underlying model_ or the _XAI method_. How stable are the findings when computing the ranks on different subsets of the metrics? If they are highly dependent on the chosen set of metrics, what do we really learn from the summary?\n\n**W2b**: The authors missed highly relevant studies that also extensively study a wide range of attribution methods according to different criteria (e.g., Hesse et al., 2023, Rao et al. 2022). A comparative discussion to such works seems necessary, especially as those works explicitly try to avoid the pitfalls raised in W2 (i.e., disentangling model behaviour from the attribution methods).\n\n**W3**: The implications and relevance of questions Q1-Q3 as well as their answers are not fully clear to me and I would appreciate if the authors could elaborate. \n\n**W4 (minor)**: The manuscript is very dense and not easy to read and I encourage the authors to place a particular focus on making the writing more accessible. For example, using non-standard abbreviations for the various methods makes it tedious to read the main text, as one needs to constantly look up what a particular abbreviation stands for (e.g., LI for LIME or LA for 'LRP Attention', etc.). Further, it is difficult to understand a given table or figure from figure + caption alone, which makes the results much less accessible (this is heavily aggravated by the non-standard abbreviations, see e.g., Fig. 3c). \n\n**W5 (minor)**: The relevance and implications of the discussion of Fig. 3a are unclear to me and the 'distinct clusters' that form seem to be an exaggeration of what is visible in the plots. Without the distinct colourings and the boxes drawn around some of the points, these points seem fairly uniformly distributed to me."

For each modality 3 different datasets were considered.\n\n- *Benchmarking Metrics:* The paper investigates 3 aspects of XAI methods faithfulness, robustness and complexity. While the paper does not introduce any metrics itself it investigates the performance of different XAI methods on 20 previously proposed metrics and groups them into the 3 aspects.\n\n Overall the LATEC consists of 7,560 different combinations that were tested, after running this benchmark the paper summarizes the takeaways as follows:\n- No XAI method ranks consistently high on all evaluation criteria. \n- The rankings of XAI methods generalize well over datasets from the same modality.\n- The complexity metrics proposed for CV tasks does not always have to match the perception of low complexity.\n\nThe paper then uses LATEC to answer 3 open XAI questions:\n\n - How does the performance of attention versus attribution methods differ in practice? They found a large difference in complexity (attention methods are more complex)  and a smaller difference in robustness  (attribution methods are more robust), while the difference in faithfulness is substantially insignificant. However, the paper does mention that the complexity methods are generally debatable since they favor methods that attribute to the smallest set of single pixels.\n\n- Does the efficacy of XAI methods vary across different computer vision modalities? The performance varies across different modalities. \n\n- With the ascendency of Transformer architectures, is there a potential misalignment with established attribution-based XAI methods?  The benchmark showed that the faithfulness of different attribution methods highly fluctuates for transformers and that attribution based methods are not necessarily a wrong choice when using a transformer architecture."

            "summary": {
                "value": "The authors developed a large-scale benchmark that critically evaluates 17 XAI methods using 20 distinct metrics, using three guiding questions of current interest. The authors perform non-trivial statistical analyses to compare different methods along 3 evaluation criteria (faithfulness, robustness, and complexity), with special attention to the specifics of each method/dataset, as well as the interplay between attribution and attention (as in Transformer models). The authors go the extra step by making all their data available, e.g., model weights and saliency maps, to further facilitate future work."

                "value": "**Presentation:**\n- Section 1:\n    - The citations on the first few sentences aren't directly tied to the citing text. Perhaps better references can be used, or the text can be modified slightly to better link to those cited article. Please clarify whether those articles provide supporting evidence, focused on subproblems or application domains, or whether their authors simply echoed similar opinions.\n    - Follow-up: it seems this discussion at the beginning is focused on saliency maps specifically. If so, please clarify the scope on the onset to be focused on XAI for computer vision models, with saliency methods as the primary approach being discussed. General statements about state-of-the-art in XAI would require an equally general selection of citations.\n    - Indeed, the authors seem to repeatedly use \"XAI research\" to solely mean works on computer vision.\n    - Please also clarify why saliency methods were chosen as the primary approach for this study, with a forward reference to a literature review highlighting other approaches.\n- Section 2:\n    - Please include a reference to Fig.1 in the main text.\n    - S2.1: it would help to include a brief description of each XAI method, e.g., in an appendix, together with references to recent surveys. (perhaps in a form similar to Appendix B.2)\n    - Figure 3/4: it seems the legend shows significance indicators that don't actually appear in the figures.\n\n**Nitpicking:**\n- Page 3: without adaptions -> adaptation? (I found 7 or so other occurrences)\n- S2.2: Due to the LATEC dataset -> Thanks to? Using?\n- S3.1: Transformer architecture inherit attention -> inherent?\n- Page 6: commendable more robustness"
