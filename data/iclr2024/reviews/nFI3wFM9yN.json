                "value": "The paper introduces Fed-GO-UCB, a federated bandit optimization algorithm designed for generic non-linear objective functions, addressing the limitations of existing methods that are confined to simplistic function classes. Federated optimization enables collaborative model estimation across decentralized datasets, ensuring data privacy and allowing large-scale computing. This is particularly beneficial for tasks requiring online interactions, such as next-word prediction in keyboard applications. Fed-GO-UCB operates under the coordination of a central server and multiple clients, ensuring data decentralization. The algorithm comprises two phases: uniform exploration and optimistic exploration, allowing clients to collaboratively minimize cumulative regret and make quality decisions during the learning process. The paper highlights the challenges in federated bandit optimization, particularly in constructing confidence sets for generic nonlinear functions and managing communication costs. Fed-GO-UCB addresses these issues through a novel confidence set construction and an efficient communication strategy. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the algorithm's superiority over existing federated bandit algorithms, particularly in approximating nonlinear functions. The paper also proves that Fed-GO-UCB achieves sub-linear rates for both cumulative regret and communication cost, making it a promising tool for decentralized machine learning applications involving sensitive data."

Novelty: Though the setting is new and the two-phase design is interesting, after the uniform exploration (phase 1), it seems to me that one can combine the techniques from centralized non-linear bandit optimization problem with the communication protocol from the federated linear bandits (Li & Wang, 2022a) and federated generalized linear bandits (Li & Wang, 2022b).\n2. Comparison with federated generalized linear bandits (Li & Wang, 2022b): From the algorithmic perspective, Li & Wang 2022b also uses some global updates (similar to uniform exploration) after the communication condition (line 6 of Algorithm 1) is satisfied, I am wondering if the current paper also uses this way to update $\\hat{w}_0$, will there be any difference or improvement in the regret analysis? Moreover, I find that Li & Wang, 2022b can only achieve $O(dN^2\\sqrt{T})$ communication. Since I suppose the current paper is more general and can cover Li & Wang 2022b, does this mean that the current paper can achieve a $O(\\sqrt{N})$ improvement because of the difference in the algorithm design?  \n3. Lower bound: I do not find any discussion about the lower bound result or any discussion about it. Without it, one cannot see how tight the results are in terms of $$N, T$$ and all other parameters. I hope the authors can discuss the tightness of their results during the rebuttal."

The theoretical guarantee of Fed-GO-UCB relies on several critical assumptions (Assumptions 1 to 3), and it may be challenging to establish whether these assumptions hold in common situations, such as neural networks with ReLU activation functions. Even if the assumptions hold, determining the values of the parameters in Fed-GO-UCB that depend on these assumptions can be a non-trivial task. It remains an open question how to calculate these constants and set the algorithm's parameters effectively in practical applications.\n\n2. The communication complexity, as indicated by Theorem 5, is stated as $O(\\sqrt{T})$, which is significantly higher than the communication complexity of $O(\\log T)$ achieved by previous works. Presenting this level of communication cost as efficient without providing lower bound results for communication complexity can be misleading. Furthermore, the experimental results in Figure 2 show a communication complexity of $10^7$ for round $T=500$, which seems highly inefficient in practice.\n\n3. In the context of federated learning, there is often a tradeoff between communication complexity and performance, specifically in terms of regret guarantee. It's a common observation that algorithms with higher communication complexity can potentially achieve better performance. To gain a clearer understanding of the algorithms' relative performances, it would be beneficial for the author to conduct experiments where the selected parameters makes different algorithms have similar communication complexity. This approach would enable a direct and fair comparison that isolates the impact of communication complexity from the approximation capabilities, providing more conclusive insights into the algorithm's efficiency and effectiveness in a practical federated learning setting."

In Figure 3, the observation that the communication complexity for several algorithms does not start from zero at time $T=0$ can be puzzling. It would be beneficial if the author could offer an explanation for this behavior.\n\n3. For the Theorem 5, is it possible to provide a corresponding lower bound to suggest that $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ communication is necessary. For instance, Min el al., 2023 [1] provide a lower bound showing\nthat a minimal $\\Omega(dM)$ communication complexity is required to improve the performance of linear bandit (or MDPs) through\ncollaboration. Insights into lower communication complexity bounds would strengthen the support for the Fed-GO-UCB algorithm and provide a more comprehensive understanding\n\n[1] Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Asynchronous Communication and Linear Function Approximation"
