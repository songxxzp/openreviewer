However, it is important to note that problem (5) does not necessarily entail the minimization of $F(x_0 + \\delta, y)$.\n2. This paper relies on the assumptions of RSC and RSS to provide a theoretical guarantee for the performance of Algorithm 1. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that this assumption may not necessarily hold, particularly in the context of adversarial attacks involving complex neural networks.\n3. The performance of Algorithm 1 is theoretically guaranteed by Theorem 2. However, the authors do not discuss the tightness of the bound. Notably, the right-hand side of the inequality established in Theorem 2 incorporates the variable $\\rho^T$. Consequently, if $\\rho>1$, the right-hand side of the inequality may diverge towards positive infinity as $T$ approaches infinity.\n\nAdditionally, minor comments:\n4. Clarity issues arise in certain parts of the text due to the identical formatting of vectors and scalars.\n5. The horizontal axis label in Figure 4 might require correction.\n6.

The optimization is solved using a natural evolution strategies algorithm. It also discusses the group overlapping separately. When G doesn\u2019t overlap, the author uses a closed-form solution for the first-order Taylor. When G overlaps, it adopts an approximate solution by using a greedy selection on G.

(4) does not seem to differ from the standard gradient estimation approach.\n- For computational cost and convergence, it only says high, medium and low. Are there any quantitative results to demonstrate it? \n- It is not clear how the algorithm performs region selection. In algorithm 1, how the delta^0 is initialised? What is the initial perturbation group set G? \n- Using the estimated gradient to perform black-box adversarial attacks is not new. Please refer to the SPSA attack [1].\n- In the experiment section. I am not sure if the comparison is fair, as different black-box attacks select different regions. Besides, the result shows that the proposed methods may actually require more queries as the median is significantly higher than other models. Also, the authors used a simple CNN for the CIFAR10 dataset. It would be more convincing to evaluate pre-trained models from PyTorch model zoo or other resources.\n- As the authors conducted a convergence analysis of the proposed attack. I am wondering if this can be further developed towards an adversarial verification method. Also, the robustness verification of adversarial patches has been done in [2]. I am also interested in the performance of the proposed attack on such a certified defence.\n\n[1] Uesato, Jonathan, et al. \"Adversarial risk and the dangers of evaluating against weak attacks.\"\u00a0ICML, 2018.\n\n[2] Salman, Hadi, et al. \"Certified patch robustness via smoothed vision transformers.\"\u00a0CVPR, 2022."
