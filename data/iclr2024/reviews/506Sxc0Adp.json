Besides, the proposed efficient also show that the current public pre-training datasets has relatively high diversity, which could explain why we can get good LLM trained on them."

                "value": "1) I understand that authors want to show the diversity coefficient can work by comparing real data diversity with theoretical lower and upper bound. However, if we treat lower bound as baseline, it is too weak to say the dataset having better diversity is really diverse?\n\n2) Since this approach requires finetuning LM, it is actually introducing some computational overhead. I understand this overhead is not large, but it should be stated in the limitation section.\n\n3) More recent data-centric related works should be added. Most related works listed are before 2022. Only two citations are after 2023, one is GPT-4, and the other is Palm 2, neither of which are references to Data Centric methods. To my knowledge, there is at least one paper about increasing data diversity from Meta AI in 2023.08. \u201cD4: Improving LLM Pretraining via Document De-Duplication and Diversification\u201d. Probably can add to the Related Work?\n\n4) Since the coding data is increasing important, authors should provides more insights about the diversity of code pre-training dataset.\n\n5) Some conclusions are not well-justified.  In appendix G, experiments conclude that \u2018higher data diversity leads to higher test performance\u2019, but fail to ablate the influence of dataset overlap. In fact, the Pile dataset itself contains both the USPTO and PubMed, so I think model trained on the \u2018USPTO+PubMed\u2019 is better than models trained on either of them cannot purely attribute to the diversity increase. It\u2019s possible that the high diversity is not the key factor, the actual factor is high diversity increase the overlap between train and test set, and therefore increase the test performance. In addition, the table in Appendix G should be further clarified. It\u2019s hard to get which dataset is the training dataset and which one is the eval set.\n\nIn general, I think this paper is good for me. Although there are some unclear statements, it is okay because this topic is very new and not well-defined. I can consider further increasing the score if the authors solve my concerns well."

Besides, I am kind of confusing about the dimension of vector\u2019s embedding. According to the formula I think the diagonal dimension should equal to the number of model\u2019s parameters. If that\u2019s true the vector will be extremely large\u2026\n\n2) The setting \u201cRandomly initialized GPT-2 without fine-tuning\u201d in Section 4 makes me confused. Does that mean you only reset the LM head or the whole model? My concern is different random initialization could lead to very different results. So it\u2019s not safe to conclude that \u2018using a random probe network (always)**underestimates** diversity\u2019.\n\n3) What\u2019s the relationship between the diversity efficient and the cross diversity efficient? What insight can we get by comparing them together?\n\n4) small typo, \u2018due\u2019 should be \u2018due to\u2019 in Sec 3.4\n\n5) In table 1, why concatenating C4 and Wikitext-103 decrease the Div Coeff? Any analysis on this exception?\n\n6) In table 1, what does the \u2018Combination of Five Datasets(MIX2)\u2019 mean? The explanation of MIX2 setting is not very clear to me. Why only five datasets? Why 0.77 vs 0.23?"

How does this affect the importance of your results in Section 4?\n\n2. **Task2Vec and Token Distribution: Confusion about Relevance to Data Quality**:\n    - In Section 2.2.4, token distribution is used as a metric for dataset diversity. Why then is it necessary to calculate Task2Vec diversity coefficients by fine-tuning the model? How is this relevant to data quality?\n    - Following from the above, Section 3.4 revisits the correlation between diversity coefficient and vocabulary size. Could you clarify why this aspect is repeatedly emphasized?\n\n### Additional Questions\n3. **Ambiguities in Section 2.1**:\n    1. You mentioned \"(partially) fine-tuning\" the final layer of a fixed neural network to solve the \"current task (or batch)\". Could you clarify what you mean by \"partially fine-tuning\"? Also, how do you define \"solving the current task (or batch)\" in this context?\n    2. The variable $t$ is used but not explicitly defined. Could you specify what $t$ represents and its range of possible values?\n    3. When discussing the expectation over both $t$ and $\\hat{x}_t$, could you elaborate on why and how this expectation is taken?\n\n4. **Minor Formatting Issues**: The in-text citation style appears to be inconsistent across the paper.\n\n5. **Potential Typo on Page 2**: In the contributions section, item 4 states, \"...the **high** diversity of public datasets for LLM pre-training is **high**...\" This appears to be a typo."
