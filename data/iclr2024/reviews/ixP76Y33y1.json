                "value": "This paper tackles the problem of measuring dataset complexity for predicting test-set generalization, showing that the trends in natural images don't match the trends in medical images. This work offers three main contributions, with theoretical results provided throughout. The first is a proposed metric they refer to as \"label sharpness\", which is meant to serve as a proxy for difficulty in generalizing by looking at the worst-case scenario between two data points where the images are very similar (by the L2 norm) but the labels are different. Second, they demonstrate that the sharpness of the dataset label distribution is negatively correlated with the adversarial robustness of a neural network. The third contribution is connecting their notion of d_data to d_repr, and showing how their scaling laws are related, with d_data serving as an approximate upper bound. The authors do this over a variety of both medical and natural image datasets and architectures."

I don't think that this is a widely held belief or has been consistently shown throughout the literature (to this the authors heavily cite a work from 2022, which shows that in some cases maybe the scaling laws are different).\n- The measure of data sharpness, in the context of medical imaging, in my opinion is not well grounded. For medical images, especially those where you need to identify minor changes or tumors to correct classify things, the majority of the image will be the same as healthy images because the anatomies will be aligned. \n- The results seem quite weak across models and datasets, and for some figures there are lines drawn in which don't represent proper trend lines (Figure 2 in particular). Additionally, in the adversarial setting, regression coefficients are computed across both medical/natural image datasets, even though it's clear that within the natural image datasets and medical image datasets that there is very little correlation (visually) (Figure 3, Figure 6).\n- A claim was that models trained on datasets with similar data and of the same size N tend to perform much worse if the data is medical images, but the architectures chosen stem from the natural image domain and were tuned to those datasets."

These seem like they would be important to draw trends with for scaling laws.\n- I am very confused why there is a theorem saying that d_data is an upper bound for d_repr, when clearly the experimental results show that this isn't the case. What are the issues that cause this mismatch?\n- Why is there not a clear trend with models that have trained on more data having lower test loss? (Figure 2)\n- Taking the L2 norm between two high-dimensional images can result in near-zero distance even if the images are very different, why not work with distances of embeddings from pre-trained models? It would be helpful if there were examples of two images that are very close (by their metric) but have different labels."

While the authors have made efforts to rule out alternatives, the medical datasets used may not directly correspond to the natural image classification tasks. For instance, the medical datasets tackle lesion detection where backgrounds are similar, likely making it more difficult than ImageNet classification. To better match ImageNet, the authors could also evaluate on RadImageNet by designing some easier tasks (e.g., CT/MRI/ultrasound discrimination). This also gives a benchmark on the scaling law when the training size is large.\n2. Image preprocessing. All images were resized to 224x224 in this study, though prior work suggests intrinsic dimension is insensitive to the resolution of natural images. The authors should verify this holds for medical images, where a minimum resolution is needed to capture lesions. Providing comparisons across multiple resolutions could reveal if label sharpness or intrinsic dimension changes substantially."

The authors should clarify the practical utility of K_F for data annotation planning, since this appears unfeasible without existing labeled data. Potentially K_F could be estimated using a small initial labeled sample, but further analysis is needed on the variability of K_F to small labeled subsets."

While this is a natural choice for natural image datasets, no practitioner would classify cancer or other abnormalities on such small images. However, the nearest-neighbor distance is dependent on $d_\\text{data}$ and $d_\\text{data}$ itself should also be dependent on $HW$. Couldn't this effect be the major explanation for the generalization error discrepancy we observe on real-world medical image data (also influencing $K_\\mathcal{F}$)? In the Supplementary the authors only investigate the effect of much smaller resolutions ($32\\times32$ px). I am not convinced this makes sense for medical imaging, and I doubt one could achieve above random accuracy on such small images ($d_\\text{repr}$ could be dependent on this).\n\n3. **Discrepancy between imaging domains** The analysis of the generalization discrepancies between imaging domains (Sec. 5.2) could be improved by computing the likelihood that the observed shift in Fig. 2 is indeed caused by Eq. 2 (similar for Fig. 5 and Eq. 4, respectively). In its current form it is hard to see that the derived law holds empirically. Particularly for Fig. 5, I doubt that this likelihood would be very high. Overall, I am not convinced that the conducted experiments support the theoretical results sufficiently. To some extent, the authors acknowledge this themselves, and openly discuss the fact that there are many (possibly much more contributing) other explanations for the observed discrepancy.\n\n4. **Adversarial robustness** I find the analysis on adversarial robustness somewhat limited.\n    - How does the scaling law behave w.r.t $K_\\mathcal{F}$ estimates in the feature space of the trained classifier?\n    - The chosen perturbation budgets $\\epsilon \\in \\{ 1/255, 2/255, 4/255, 8/255\\}$ have vastly different interpretations for medical and natural images because medical images are *always* represented using floating point numbers. For example for CT data a budget of $8/255$ on images rescaled to $[0,1]$ could alter the pixel values by several hundreds Houndsfield units (HU), a perturbation easily detectable due to the physical interpretation of HU.\n\n5. **Investigate different architectures and tasks** Not that much of a weakness as it is a suggestion for future work. The authors limit their analysis to standard CNNs and a binary classification task. I think it would be very interesting to consider newer architectures and multi-class classification or even segmentation (also briefly mentioned by the authors w.r.t. relation between $d_\\text{repr}$ and $d_\\text{data}$) tasks. In particular it would be very interesting to see whether we can use these insights to predict uncertainty of a classification given the $K_\\mathcal{F}$ between similar labels (e.g. types of metastasis).\n\n6. **Source Code** Unfortunately the authors did not provide the source code for their experiments in the Supplementary."
