                "value": "Before discussing the weaknesses, I have to admit I have more expertise in CS, and my knowledge in statistics is limited. I might ask some naive questions and please correct me if I am wrong.\n\nThe structure of the draft can be better organized for a better readability, the current version is a little confusing. The overall idea is applying an existing method from statistics, POT, to locate salient parameters. The main baseline is (Levin 2021) which also studies the parameter saliency. However, the motivation of this study is not well introduced. In the introduction and the related work, a list of studies in XAI and statistics are sequentially displayed without discussing what kind of problems this draft can solve. For instance, Sec.2 \"Related work\", Interpretability, this paragraph is more like a basic tutorial, which is not directly related to this study, neither it is complete. The second paragraph in Sec2 is more about the CAM-based, which is not in the parameter space. I would suggest only discuss the most related parameter saliency, and POT related studies.\n\nPreliminary 3.1 is re-introducing the study (Levin), which is not necessary. The most important part is missing in that section, whats the limitation in the previous solution(Levin) and how this solution can solve that. I can grab some scatter information from the draft, previous study assumes the gradient follows a normal distribution, and this assumption may not hold, as discussed in Motivation Sec 4.1. I cannot see a clear demonstration that POT can solve this problem or I might miss this. Prior to the solution, this draft didnot showcase the problem of the normal distribution assumption. I know most CS scientist naively assume normal distribution, because it is simple yet effective. If this assumption is problematic, they can simple assume a more specific distribution. Could the normal distribution be \"simple\" enough for the study now? From the view of the solution, Appendix C, EVT normally add more assumptions to catch more distributions, which means the solution could be either not necessary (the normal assumption is enough) or limited (could the combined EVD catch everything?) I might miss something in the paper, proposition 1 and appendix B also are based on normal distribution, can I ask why a simple normal distribution can be representative enough in this problem raised?\n\nWithout a clear problem introduction, the proposed method is not clear and convincing in enough at this moment. And the results in Figs 3 and 4 also show that the difference is tiny, which echos the question, do we really need a more complicated distribution for this purpose now?\n\nTiny suggestion, I know Figs 3 and 4 have different components, but it is better to use the same colour and the same name of the same thing, e.g., POT vs Levin, or (proposed vs baseline). I searched around the paper, has the term \"baseline\" been explained?"
