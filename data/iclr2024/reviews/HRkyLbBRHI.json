E.g. ReBRAC (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09836.pdf) which is the state-of-the-art algorithm from this family.\n\n* Could you please run experiments on AntMaze or Adroit domains or test your approach in offline-to-online setup?

The experiments and ablations are generally solid and thorough, across many relevant benchmarks."

It would be interesting to see the comparison between this approach (combined with CQL) and COMBO (if COMBO results can be reproduced), as COMBO also shows significantly less conservatism when used with CQL compared to CQL on its own. I wouldn't say that this is a big weakness, but I feel like from a high level it would be worth it to do this comparison.\n\nThere has also been work showing that even synthetic experience replay [2] from strong generative models is useful for RL -- might be worth citing or comparing against as well, but I may be wrong here. Again, not a huge weakness in my eyes but would be interesting to see the comparison.\n\n[1] Tianhe Yu, Aviral Kumar, Rafael Rafailov, Aravind Rajeswaran, Sergey Levine, Chelsea Finn; COMBO: Conservative Offline Model-based Policy Optimization (NeurIPS 2021)\n\n[2] Cong Lu, Philip J.

The proposed anchor-seeking policy, which utilizes reverse model rollouts, aims to identify these components from within the distribution seen during training, ensuring relevance and improving computational efficiency. The policy is complemented by a reverse dynamics model that diversifies the training data, allowing the model to generalize to new environments effectively. This novel method has been empirically shown to enhance the performance of several state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms."
