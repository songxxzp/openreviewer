The performance metrics used encompass recall and precision and matches that used in previous work. The comparisons seem solid for the most part. Overall, although these results do not consistently outperform the state of the art, they look comparable depending on the dataset.\n\n### Demonstrates that equivariant architectures are not strictly necessary for this problem\n\nThe authors also call attention to the fact that DPFs get comparable performance to Torsional Diffusion, and this shows that roto-translational equivariance may not be strictly required for conformer prediction (Torsional Diffusion is implemented using an SE(3) equivariant architecture, but the DPF in this manuscript directly generates 3D coordinates of atoms from molecular graphs. Although this is not a core contribution of the paper, it is useful to know nonetheless.\n\nAlso, I very much enjoyed and appreciated the quotations in \u201c\u2018simple\u2019 DDPM loss\u201d."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "### Limited novelty relative to DPF paper\n\nThe technical and empirical novelty is fairly limited in this paper. It is a direct application of DPFs (Zhuang et. al. 2023) to a molecular-conformer generation. The neural network also has an identical architecture, and the difference is solely to apply it to this different problem. The representation of atom/node \u201ccoordinates\u201d (i.e. the field domain) as Laplacian eigenvectors is also a direct application of Maskey, et. al. 2022.\n\n### Several claims are not very well substantiated; these claims should be reworded in the text\n\nBelow are a list of claims I found in the paper which I did not find to be well substantiated. The authors should either provide stronger evidence for these claims, or reword the claim to be more accurate.\n\n-  The paper claims that explicitly enforcing domain-specific inductive biases (e.g. periodic domain of possible torsional angles in Torsion Diff) comes at a cost, but what is the cost? Torsional Diffusion seems to be performing just as well as MCF (sometimes better).\n\n- The paper claims that MCF is more scalable than other methods (e.g. Torsional Diffusion). The architecture of MCF is quite large, however, and for a system of 100 atoms, there are 200 queries to the model (100 context pairs and 100 query pairs). Is it really more scalable than Torsional Diffusion?\n\n- The paper claims that the ablation study shows what factors are important for molecular-conformer generation, but this is a pretty grandiose claim. The ablation study only shows the impact of atom features and the size of the Laplacian eigenvectors, _specifically on MCF performance_. It does not lend insight into what factors are important for molecular-conformer generation in general.\n \n- The paper claims that explicitly enforcing roto-translation equivariance is not a strong requirement for generalization, and that equivariance is not particularly useful for molecular-conformer generation. Although the authors have shown similar and comparable performance between an equivariant and non-equivariant architecture, it is not yet clear whether or not equivariance really affects performance. For example, one could ask whether MCFs could outperform Torsional Diffusion if it had used a roto-translationally equivariant architecture (not just PerceiverIO).\n\n### Splitting of molecules into datasets may have leakage\n\nThe datasets seem to be split into training/validation/test uniformly at random, but this can lead to train/test leakage. Many molecules in the datasets share very similar scaffolds, and it is well known that prediction between similar scaffolds is much easier. To really assess the quality of the model, the datasets should be split into scaffold-aware subsets to avoid leakage.\n\nI understand this issue is almost certainly inherited from previous works (e.g. Torsional Diffusion), so I do not count this against the evaluation of this paper, but I highly recommend exploring better dataset splits so that we may all do better moving forward.\n\n### The continuity of MCF needs more exploration and explanation\n\nFigure 6 and the exploration of the continuity of MCFs does not seem very strong or insightful. The analysis only shows that the model learns to \u201cround\u201d coordinates toward atom centers. There is no indication that the model actually learns any information about molecular bonds (and not to put atom density on them). One could claim that the model will always output some set of atomic coordinates which are not too close to each other _regardless_ of the input, even if the network has no understanding of bonds.\n\nIt is also not clear what the benefit is to being able to predict on interpolated atom coordinates. Is the goal to be able to input the interpolated eigenvector halfway between two nodes and generate the 3D coordinate that is halfway between the two atoms? If so, then this analysis very much shows the opposite. Is the goal to be able to input the interpolated eigenvector halfway between two nodes and probabilistically generate the 3D atomic coordinate of either endpoint atom? If so, then this analysis does somewhat show that, but I don\u2019t see why this latter question is interesting or useful.\n\n### Some parts of the writing can be clearer\n\n- More background on DPF would be nice; this work is so dependent on DPFs, that it would be good to have more background on how they work\n\n- Limitations of this method should really go in the main text\n\n- It would be good to include the definitions of performance metrics like RMSD recall (in the supplement) instead of needing to refer to the Torsional Diffusion paper\n\n- Notation should be cleaner: if a molecule\u2019s conformer is a function $f: \\mathcal{G}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, this implies the function maps an entire molecular graph to a single 3D coordinate\n\n- \u201cequivairant\u201d in first paragraph of Section 2\n\n- \u201cIn contraposition\u201d should be \u201cIn contrast\u201d"

Is the RMSD cutoff $\\delta$ the same as previous works for precision/recall?\n\nIt is crucial that the dataset splits (and RMSD precision/recall $\\delta$ value) are the same here compared to prior works, because the performance numbers in the tables are directly copied from those papers.\n\n### What atom features are concatenated? How are bond features incorporated (e.g. double vs triple bonds)? \n\n### What is the purpose of predicting on the query set instead of context set in DPFs?\n\nThis question is more related to DPFs in general (and is not specific to MCFs), to make sure I understand the work. Why is there a separate query set and context set in DPFs? If we are adding noise to the signal of the context set, why not just predict the denoising of the context? Instead, we are taking another query set (with the same coordinates) and adding noise separately and predicting denoising of the query set."

                "value": "Inconsistency in Chemical Properties Experiment\nIn Section A.3.3, which pertains to the chemical properties experiment, this paper adopts experimental results from \"Torsional Diffusion.\" However, there's a discrepancy in the subsets used. Specifically, the paper does not use the identical subset as \"Torsional Diffusion,\" implying that they have selected different molecules. This raises concerns about the validity of their experimental comparison. For it to be persuasive, it should be more convincingly aligned.\n\nErrors in Previous Studies\nIn section 1, page 2, For example, the quality of conformers from GeoMol (Ganea et al., 2021) and Torsional Diffusion (Jing et al., 2022) depends on the local substructure prediction model which is not differentiable.\nIn section 2, page 2, In GeoMol (Ganea et al., 2021), the authors propose a regression objective coupled with an Optimal Transport loss to predict the torsional angles of bonds that assemble substructures of a molecule\n\nGeoMol's prediction of the local substructure is based on bond length, bond angle, and torsion angle. The definitions of torsion angle in GeoMol and Torsional Diffusion are different. For Torsional Diffusion, the torsion angle is based on rotatable bonds only.\n\nInsufficient Performance\nThe GEOM-DRUGS dataset is considered a more challenging metric in this field. The method proposed in this paper demonstrates enhanced performance only regarding recall. Recall measures the capability to locate ground-truth conformers within the generated ones, and this metric is susceptible to influences from the training data. Notably, Torsional Diffusion depends on the local generated by RDKit, utilizing only 30 normalized conformers for each molecule during training. Although both the proposed method and Torsional Diffusion use the same dataset and split, the mean count of conformers in the GEOM-DRUGS dataset is approximately 100. This suggests that the boost in recall could result from the proposed method being trained on over 300% more conformers and having double the training epochs rather than the inherent efficacy of the method.\n\nFurthermore, in terms of precision, the proposed method is worse than Torsional Diffusion, especially evident when Torsional Diffusion undergoes 50 denoising steps, as shown in [Table.9] of the supplemental, and MCF requires 1000 denoising steps.\n\nHigh Computation Cost\nThe training settings for the proposed method use 8*A100 with a batch size of 64 (or one A100 with a batch size of 8). In contrast, Torsional Diffusion is trained on a singular A6000 with a batch size of 32. Consequently, the computational expense for each denoising phase for the proposed method is at least four times that of Torsional Diffusion. Considering Torsional Diffusion necessitates only 20 denoising steps, whereas MCF demands 1000, the proposed method, with a computational cost over two hundred times more, should ideally yield superior results, especially with larger molecules.\n\nAbsence of Runtime Experimental Results and Lack Significance\nA pivotal metric for the conformer generation task is runtime. Even though some early deep-learning research might not have emphasized runtime, recent studies, such as GeoMol [Figure.7] and Torsional Diffusion [Table.2], regard it as a critical experimental metric. Historically, cheminformatics methods recognized runtime as a vital metric even before the advent of deep learning, as documented in [Conformation Generation: The State of the Art].\n\nFurthermore, CREST, a method based on in metadynamics, is used to generate GEOM-Drugs dataset. The computational cost of CREST in GEOM-DRUGS is about 90 CPU core-hours per drug-like molecule, as detailed in [Torsional Diffusion Section 2, Page 2]. In contrast, Torsional Diffusion requires roughly 5-CPU core seconds for a conformer, while MCF might need between 15 to 20 CPU core-minutes (considering the computational cost is over 200 times). \n\nGiven that the average number (N) of conformers per molecule is about 100, MCF might need a minimum of 60 CPU core-hours to generate conformers (2N) for a single molecule. This speed is comparable to the dataset's generation rate (90 CPU core-hours per molecule). Hence, the proposed method's significance is low, especially when weighed against its high computational demands.\n\nReferences: \nGanea, Octavian, et al.
