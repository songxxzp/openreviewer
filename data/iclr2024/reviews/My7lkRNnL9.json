                "value": "1. I think this paper requires a clearer definition of the considered \u201cforward-only\u201d algorithms. In the abstract, it is defined as \u201cavoiding a backward pass\u201d. However, PEPITA, different from local FF, indeed requires a direct global error feedback to inputs. If PEPITA is considered as \u201cforward-only\u201d, is DFA also \u201cforward-only\u201d, as it shares the similar form of direct global error feedback without layer-by-layer BP? In the sense of \u201cforward-only\u201d algorithms, I don\u2019t think PEPITA is parallel to FF with local learning.\n\n2. In Table 1, why the considered rule has a much worse performance? It is unclear why we should consider it as it does not introduce additional properties over several algorithms while being worse. Additionally, what\u2019s the detailed definition for \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cactivity freezing\u201d? For PEPITA, it requires global error feedback to inputs, and storage of activations of the first forward propagation until the second forward propagation ends. Why it is considered \u201clocal\u201d and solving \u201cactivity freezing\u201d? And why PEPITA outperforms DFA in these aspects?\n\n3. In Section 3.1, the similarity to DFA only holds for the first layer. It is unclear for other layers (Eq. (4)).\n\n4. In Section 4, the networks are still quite shallow and experimental results are quite poor. DFA can scale to large datasets and networks [1], and WM also scales to large-scale scenarios [2].\n\n5. Some derivations are not strict and may be contradictory. For example, in Section 3 and Section 5, it is assumed for several times that $Fe$ is much smaller than $x$ so it can be ignored. In Section 5, however, it is also assumed that the \u201cmodulated\u201d samples can be used for negative samples in the FF framework. If the modulation is small enough, why can it formulate a valid negative sample? This largely reduces the reliability of the connection between PEPITA and FF.\n\nOverall, I think there is no enough contribution in empirical or theoretical perspectives.\n\n[1] Direct feedback alignment scales to modern deep learning tasks and architectures.

Based on that, I have two questions:\n1. Would performance of both algorithms match if we reduce the learning rate of PEPITA-TL? Intuitively it should, since the anti-Hebbian error terms would match.\n2. Can we consider PEPITA-Hebbian temporally local since it's a long-term plasticity rule? Since the network is trained with two passes over the same input, the PEPITA-TL approximation adds the first Hebbian term immediately after the first forward pass, so 10s/100s of ms. This would be too short for long-term Hebbian changes (as far as I know), so in your model you can treat both parts of the update rule as if they happen for the same network state -- meaning that PEPITA-Hebbian would be temporally local. (I guess you can account for short-term plasticity as a result of the first forward pass (so non-Hebbian changes proportional to input activity only).)\n\nSmall comments:\n1. Tab1 should have PEPITA-Hebbian performance too.\n2. The appendix can be included in the main pdf in this conference."
