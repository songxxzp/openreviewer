                "value": "Given that the representations of isomorphic nodes are the same, their link that aggregates the representations cannot capture some structural representation like CN, and thus it is intractable to perform the link prediction task. Based on this observation, this paper investigates the widely-used MPNN and finds that MPNN is capable of capturing joint structural features theoretically and empirically. The solution is to inject orthogonality into input vectors. Equipped with the orthogonality of the input vectors, the authors propose MPLP to estimate link information and accomplish the link prediction task. The experiments show that MPLP promotes significantly in the link prediction on both attributed/non-attributed datasets."

As I understand, the previous work believes that GNNs/MPNNs cannot do this supposing that isomorphic nodes have the same representation. So, this paper exploits the orthogonality in the input vectors, which is reasonable and does not totally contradict the previous work. This paper is basically valuable for supplementing the link prediction capability of GNNs/MPNNs in both theorems and experiments.\n+ The authors propose a further discussion that some GNNs have the ability to perform link prediction tasks on attributed datasets due to the orthogonality of attributes. This is an interesting discussion that might contribute to the incense reason why GNNs/MPNNs can perform link prediction on attributed benchmarks. The empirical findings in Table 4 bring about the phenomenon and leave the issues that are worth discussing.\n+ The results demonstrate that MPLP outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on both attributed/non-attributed benchmarks."

Therefore, I think it is very interesting and important to study the connection between the message passing and the common neighbor heuristics. It is straightforward to establish a one-hot vector to encode the neighbor node information. I like the theoretical analysis in Theorem 2. However, I do not get how you derive the CN from the product operation and use them in the GNNs. I am trying to understand Figure 3, but there is no caption explaining what colors stand for. Also, in Theorem 3, you introduce a walk operation counting the number of length-l walks between nodes u and node v. I wonder how you conduct this operation in practice. I suspect this operation would be super time-consuming to enumerate all the possible walks. For the experiment section, I consider your method as a general method that can be applied to various GNNs. So, I expect the authors to compare their method with the baselines under the same GNN base such as GCN or SAGE. Another main issue is that the proposed method only gets marginal improvement (not significant improvement according to the mean and the std) compared to the baselines in many cases. Therefore, overall, I would like to give a weak rejection, but if the authors can answer my above questions or point out my misunderstanding part, I will be happy to raise my score."

MPLP does a fine job of this through it's problem formulation, equations, and theorems. It also takes care of tying in their motivations to numerous other relevant papers. \n- Quality: The spread of datasets captures a variety of domains and the experiments are structured in a ways that directly supports the author's claims.\n- Clarity: The principles for the theorems and experiments are well-founded, it respects the reader's background in understanding related GNN works and keeps the discussion about any innovation presented in the paper succinct.\n- Significance: The use of quasi-orthogonal vectors as a means of enhancing the message-passing capabilities of GNNs is entirely novel as far as I know, albeit it does extend principles from SOTA models. Future research could be inspired by a high-level approach that is similar to MPLP. MPLP's ability to estimate CN and DE is also a promising and significant improvement for GNN's ability to conduct link prediction. The non-attributed benchmark test, as shown in Table 1, is an interesting inclusion that speaks to the power of MPLP to handle non-standard link prediction scenarios.

This seems relevant for the subsequent evaluations of inference, dimensions, and batch sizes. But, is still limited since the current SOTA models run experiments with Hits@100, Hits@20, and MRR.\n- The test for the estimation capabilities seems limited by testing just GCN and SAGE.

The results from which would lend more credence to the claims made about expressiveness and the effects of implementing quasi-orthogonal vectors into link prediction models. \n- The node-label estimation of CN and DE is promising. However, it seems limited in scope since it approximates just CN or DE and does not extend further to DRNL or DE+.

However, when considering the expressiveness of MPLP with random features and it's ability to estimate triangles, why not include a provably expressive GNN to test like GIN?\n- What sort of limitations would integrating DRNL into GCN or SAGE pose?
