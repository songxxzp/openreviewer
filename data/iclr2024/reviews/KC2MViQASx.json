Technically the author(s) are proposing a GAN-like MI estimator, where an f-divergence-based function is optimized to learn the density ratio, then plug in that density ratio estimate into the MI definition to approximate the MI. This is similar in spirit to the DIM work [1], where the JSD objective (also an f-divergence) was used. Also, the idea of dropping the partition function to reduce estimation variance for MI has also been explored in the work of FLO [2], where similar Fenchel duality is applied to cast the log(partition) into a nested optimization problem. These closely related works should be discussed and compared. Also highly relevant is the work of RenyiCL [3], where skewed Renyi divergence is used as a more generic mutual information measure that enjoys bounded variance for numerical estimation. \n\n[1] R.

The author(s) only compared different estimators on the toy multi-dimensional Gaussian data, which is inadequate by today's standard.

The bias comes from Jensen's inequality, not Monte Carlo sampling. \n* The statement \"Although MINE provides a tighter bound $I_{MINE} \u2265 I_{NWJ}$, the NWJ estimator is unbiased.\" is also misleading. Both MINE and NWJ can be tight estimators. Note that MINE is an approximation to MI, while NWJ is a formal lower bound, so technically you can not compare the two with an inequality. \n* The notation of permutation function $\\sigma(y)$ is not common in the statistical literature and causes confusion."

Unfortunately, however, I cannot strongly recommend this paper as an ICLR 2024 accepted paper for the following reasons: (1) discrepancies between claims and content, (2) ambiguous presentation in the important theoretical analysis part, and (3) concerns about the validity of the experimental evaluation of the proposed method. The details are provided below. If there are any misunderstandings, I apologize, and I would appreciate it if you could explain them to me.\n\n## Discrepancies between claims and content\n- The authors claimed that their derangement training strategy achieves the unbounded MI estimation. However, I couldn't found out the theory and proof to justify this claim unless I'm misreading. I can only see that they only showed that the permutation bound is bounded by $\\log N$. I read the experimental part, but could not find anything to support this claim either. At this stage, the contributions mentioned in the introduction do not align with the content, and I am compelled to express concerns regarding the validity of this research paper.\n- Is it possible to overcome the $\\log N$ upper bound on the mutual information neural estimation through the maximization of the variational lower bound, perhaps by employing a simple technique such as derangements? The recent paper [1] has shown that, not just CPC, **any distribution-free high-confidence lower bound on mutual information estimated from $N$ samples cannot be larger than $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$**. When I first read the preface of this paper and found the claim that unbounded estimation had been achieved despite such serious statistical limitations, I was both surprised and hopeful. However, I am disappointed to discover that there is no theoretical basis or related discussion to support this assertion.\n\n## Ambiguous presentation in the important theoretical analysis part\n- The theoretical analysis in Sections 4 and 5 is the most crucial part of this paper as it provides strong support for the favorable properties of the method proposed in this paper. Nevertheless, the presentation in these sections introduces assumptions, notations, and proof sketches abruptly before delving into the discussion of the results obtained. This made it quite challenging to grasp the intent and content when I first read it. I believe that it would be challenging for readers to comprehend the content on first encounter if the section's opening does not provide an outline of what is to be demonstrated and the results obtained before sharing the proof's details.\n- Given that the primary purpose here is to present theoretical results, it would be advisable to organize them as theorems or proposition and provide formal proofs in the main text or in an appendix for clarity and thoroughness (Just to reiterate, I would like to declare that I understand that the proofs for Lemma 1, 2, and other such elements used in the explanatory proofs of each section are provided in the appendices.).\n- I believe that readability is a crucial element in effectively presenting the main theoretical claims. Currently, it is necessary to read the content multiple times to understand it to some extent, which can lead to the final intended message becoming unclear. Additionally, I'm concerned about important theoretical aspects being placed in the appendix. For instance, isn't Lemma 3 an important property of the proposed estimator?\n\n## Concerns about the validity of the experimental evaluation of the proposed method\n- I also have concerns regarding the validity of interpreting the experimental results.The authors claim that from the experimental results presented in Figure 1, their proposed f-DIME estimator achieves lower variance compared to conventional methods (MINE, NWJ, SMILE). However, at least to me, it doesn't seem like there is a significant difference. I've also examined the experimental results in Fig. 2-5 and the Appendix, but it appears that there are no results provided to substantiate this claim. Even when reviewing Table 1, which provides quantitative evaluations, it is clear that C PC consistently achieves good performance in terms of variance, which contradicts this claim entirely. I hope it's my misinterpretation, but it's quite challenging to accept this claim as valid.\n- The precision of the f-DIME estimator doesn't seem to be consistently good overall. However, there's no mention of this, and in fact, it's claimed to be robust to changes in data size and dimension. To me, it appears that NJEE and SMILES are rather stable. For instance, in Fig. 2, the accuracy of HD-DIME w./ separable in the cubic case seems to deteriorate compared to Fig. 1. It's challenging to confirm the proposed method's exceptional robustness based on these experimental results.\n- Is it correct to say that the estimator in the \"deranged\" setting (the green line) is the most crucial among the f-DIME estimators, such as GAN-DIME? It appears that its accuracy is inferior to other methods in many experiments. However, there is no discussion addressing this, which leaves questions about the claim in the introduction that the proposed approach is state-of-the-art.\n\n## MISC\n- I recommend adhering to the ICLR format. The authors seem to have mistakenly used a different font style from the original ICLR template. This is evident, for instance, in the title where the font appears distinct. Furthermore, there also seems to be a slightly wider character spacing throughout the document. This could be a candidate for a desk reject."

I would appreciate your responses.\n\n- I would greatly appreciate your response to the concerns outlined in the weakness section, with particular attention to the discrepancies between the claims of contributions and the interpretation of experimental results in contrast to the actual findings, as these are the most crucial issues requiring attention.\n- In [1], it has been demonstrated that estimation based on MI lower bounds using neural networks faces difficulties in surpassing the log(N) upper bound. Can the authors' proposed method truly overcome this limit? If it is possible, please provide a formal proof. Additionally, it would be valuable to hear the authors' thoughts on the relationship between this research and [1], while citing it in the process.\n\n## Citation\n(Note: I am not the author of the following papers)\n\n[1]: D.

I would like to extend my gratitude to the authors for their thorough and relevant discussion and rebuttal. I have revised the soundness and contribution scores, upgrading them from 2 to 3. Although the presentation still poses a challenge, I believe this paper is highly deserving of acceptance at ICLR. Therefore, I am raising the overall rating to 6."

Theoretically, authors show that the new estimator has smaller variance. Practically, authors evalute the performances of three different f-divergence MI estimators on benchmark synthetic data and sanity self-consistency tests."

Moreover, it seems there is no consistent winner for all f-divergence MI estimators that always performs better than others. \nFor example, when the true MI is large, KL\u2212DIME has a low variance but a high bias; whereas GAN-DIME has low bias but high variance.\nHence, it is hard to say which estimator really achieves a good bias-variance tradeoff; given that some other estimators also perform well, e.g., NJEE."
