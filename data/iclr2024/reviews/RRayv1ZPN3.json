The agent is trained on multiple tasks, one task at the time, and the objective is to learn the new tasks while retaining the performance in old tasks. TAIL algorithms update only a small set of parameters, inspired by parameter efficient training from language model space. The results show that TAIL combined with LoRA outperforms all tested alternatives, especially full finetuning (tuning the whole network) or other methods that fine-tune the whole network."

                "value": "### Quality & Contribution\nOne of the main weaknesses of this paper is the lack of comprehensive empirical analysis over multiple different benchmarks, especially those used by previous baseline methods. Particularly, **the conclusions and empirical insights were drawn only from a single dataset, with no results from any other public datasets**. As the main contribution, this paper shows that the LoRA-type integration of the adapter in continual imitation learning performs the best. The paper thus concludes that they \u201care contrary to many results from the vision and language model literature which show that full fine-tuning works better\u201d. However, these results are drawn based on LIBERO robotic manipulation continual learning benchmark ONLY. They have not been verified by any other datasets. It is thus unclear if and how the results and conclusions can be generalized to other robot control tasks, e.g., Franka-Kitchen. \n\nFurthermore, it is unclear if the baseline methods have been well tuned for the LIBERO benchmark. For example, the RoboAdapter method may need to tune the adapter locations and different pre-trained representations for its optimal performance. The paper, however, seems to take the default configs, even though those configs were originally proposed for other robot tasks. To have a fair comparison with RoboAdapter, the paper should consider some of datasets used by RoboAdapter paper, i.e., Metaworld, Franka-Kitchen, and RGB-Stacking task suites, replicate the reported performance of RoboAdapter and then demonstrates on at least one of those datasets that the TAIL performs better than RoboAdapter. \n\n### Originality & Significance\nThe originality of this paper can be limited and incremental. \n\n**In terms of technique**, the adapter idea has been well studied by the RoboAdapter paper, which introduces the adapter layer (Sequential Integration in this paper) to imitation learning and considers its application in robot controls. Though the paper proposes two other adapter mechanisms, LoRA & Prefix prompt tuning, both of them are taken directly from other papers, without any substantial modifications or creative combinations to the continual imitation learning or robot control tasks. \n\n**In terms of the empirical results**, they may not offer any in-depth understanding of using adapters in continual imitation learning and the significance can be limited. The paper mentions that TAIL with LoRA \u201cavoiding catastrophic forgetting and preserving adaptation plasticity\u201d. Avoiding catastrophic forgetting can be evident since the adapter weights are task-specific and not shared across different tasks. But the empirical results shed little light on the adaptation plasticity. It is unclear if and how the adaptation plasticity is preserved given that the empirical results focus only on the success rate, as in Figure 4."

Why all methods need to have a similar number of parameters? Even though the adapter integration mechanisms are different? Could this constraint on the number of parameters be biased towards to LoRA adapter? (since \u201cfiltering often requires a larger bottleneck size compared to that of LoRA, leading to more parameters\u201d)\n\n2. In the experiment Table 1, \u201cThe BWT for TAIL methods are all 0 (no catastrophic forgetting)\u201d. Is it self-evident? since the TAIL methods produce an ensemble of models (fixed pretrained weights + task-specific adapter weights), each of which aims to solve a dedicated task and is updated independently to each other. Then why do we need to use BWT as a performance indicator. \n\n3. The colours for Prefix Token & Frozen cannot be easily distinguished in Figure 2."

                "value": "This paper introduces a new architecture named TAIL for imitation learning, which effectively adapts large pretrained models to new tasks with limited demonstration data. The main contribution of this method is to effectively incorporate lightweight adapter modules into pretrained models using various integration techniques, including parallel integration (with LoRA weights), sequential integration (Bottleneck Adapter), and prefix token integration. \n\nThe paper provides a comprehensive comparison of these adaptation techniques on the LIBERO robotic manipulation continual learning benchmark. The results indicate that TAIL, particularly when utilizing LoRA integration, outperforms the compared methods in terms of both forward and backward transfer.\n\nOverall, while this paper may not introduce strong technical novelty, it offers a good empirical study of lightweight continual learning techniques for imitation learning of robot control tasks."

                "value": "1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n2. The paper includes sufficient experiments on the LIBERO benchmark, which can effectively demonstrate the advantages of employing TAIL in conjunction with the LoRA integration technique.\n3. The proposed TAIL-based methods greatly outperform the conventional fine-tuning method in both forward transfer results and adaptation efficiency."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. My primary concern is the technical novelty of this paper, although I acknowledge the significance of benchmarking and conducting an extensive empirical investigation of existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. The proposed TAIL framework, which incorporates lightweight adapters and task-specific heads, shares similarities with existing methods in continual learning and multi-task learning, as demonstrated in the paper from Rebuffi et al. (2017) titled 'Efficient Parametrization of Multi-Domain Deep Neural Networks.' Although TAIL introduces a new multi-modal, Transformer-based architecture, the core idea bears a strong resemblance to prior work.\n2. In Figure 4, the authors primarily compare various design choices within the TAIL framework when presenting forward adaptation results. It would be valuable if the authors could extend this analysis to include a comparison of TAIL's best performance with the state of the art in lifelong imitation learning. Furthermore, in Table 1, the comparison of TAIL's forward transfer performance with previous continual learning methods may not be fair enough. This is because EWC and ER primarily address catastrophic forgetting and may not contain task-specific model parameters. \n3. In Figure 5, a comparison between TAIL and EWC/ER may not be entirely equitable, considering that these prior methods do not assume known task IDs or retain task-specific model parameters. I would like to suggest the authors include a comparison with multi-task learning methods for a more comprehensive evaluation."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Is a separate adapter $\\omega_k$ trained for each task suite? My understanding is that when re-evaluating previous task suites $j$, the previously trained adapter $\\omega_j$ is reloaded instead of testing the previous task on the adapter $\\omega_k$ trained for the current task $k$. \n2. In Figure 4, it would be insightful to determine whether combining all integration techniques, including LoRA, Bottleneck Adapter, and Prefix Token, would yield further performance improvements."
