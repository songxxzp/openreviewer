Such assumptions rarely hold in practice; and in contrast to standard machine learning tasks where most methods remain useful even if such assumptions are violated (e.g. typical regression procedures continue to estimate the conditional expectation), for causal representation learning the utility of the proposed method is far less clear.\n\n2. The above concern mostly applies to the second stage of the procedure.  For the first stage it appears that the method only relies on the conditional expectation having the form of $E(y\\mid x) = w_t^\\top f(x)$ (plus bijectivity and task diversity), but in such cases I feel that the assumption is better stated just as in Lachapelle et al (2023), namely we can learn a feature extractor that is linearly equivalent to the ground truth.\n\n3. Regarding experiments, I think it would be more convincing if the authors could include comparisons to the recent works of Lachapelle et al (2023) and Fumero et al (2023), as they addressed the same problem and have been publicly available for 4-5 months.\n\n4. Finally, I find the feature-space linearity assumption $E(y\\mid x) = w_t^\\top f(x)$ somewhat unsettling for the use in causal representation learning.  While similar assumptions have appeared in stylized theoretical analyses for multi-task learning, designing a causal representation learning procedure based on such assumptions appears to be asking much more."

The spurious factor generation has similar issue with being not so general. Yet another assumptions is that of uninformative prior on the weights (but none on the covariances), which feels more like a technical trick that is required. From causal perspective, it feels limiting to assume a linear form for generating $y$ It is thus hard to see what is a naturally suitable application are for this model. Finally, assuming that there is a certain number of latent variables which then switch across tasks on whether they are spurious/causal seems again simplistic (but would love to hear if I'm wrong on this!). \n\n2. **Some of the claims with respect to identifiability results feel exaggerated**: \"*We emphasize that this is a stronger identifiability result than identifiability up to block permutations and scaling (i.e., strong identifiability) as in prior works*\", \"*We emphasize that this strictly strong identifiability class is stronger than the strong identifiability class as in prior works (Khemakhem et al., 2020a; Lu et al., 2022) which are only identifiable up to*\" -- Similarly strong identifiability results have been shown in a general setting in Halva et al. (2021), please see their Theorem 2 in particular and its proof that share similar ideas. Theorem 3, 4 in Halva and Hyvarinen (2020) show strong identifiability in a more specific case, with the similarity here being the exploitation of linear independence and Gaussianity. The authors have cited these works elsewhere and should therefore be also aware of their identifiability results. Further, Morioka et al. (Independent Innovation Analysis, 2021) shows similar identifiability results and proof in their Theorem 2 (though for a different model). Theorem 3.2. and the MTRN identifiability results appear to be essentially the same as those of iVAE (Khemakhem et al.) so I am having hard time understanding whether it has any novel contribution in itself or whether it only sets up the 'second part' with stronger identifiability. Further, the \n\nOther issues:\n- Would be nice to have some references/citations if you make strong statements like this \"This contrasts with current state-of-the-art approaches, whose assumptions also fit our assumed data generating process but which are difficult to train effectively and only identifiable up to block permutations and scaling.\" Which works are these? Why are they difficult to train, and where is that shown? And again last part about identifiability is not even true as shown above.\n- \"... Willetts & Paige (2021); Kivva et al. (2022) recently extend the results in unsupervised generative models to the case of models with mixture model priors.\" Not all these papers assume mixture model priors specifically\n- Given the following statement, you should have included them as baselines: \"concurrent work (Lachapelle et al., 2023; Fumero et al., 2023) has expanded this area of research to consider the multi-task and meta-learning settings.\"\n- Figure 2 appearing before Figure 1 is always confusing...\n- \"...existence of d independent ground-truth...\" please be careful of the word independent and how it's used\n- \"The marginal likelihood of $\\psi$ under MTLCM is given by\" imprecise language -- it's not the likelihood of $\\psi$ as they are not random variables."
