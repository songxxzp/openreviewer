The authors show how the CPE arises as a consequence of models under-fitting the data and demonstrate how this can be remedied precisely by lowering the temperature. They connect their findings with previously established theories surrounding the CPE and show that most such explanations can be unified within their framework."

The problem of the cold posterior effect has lead to a plethora of works aiming at understanding it and most of these explanations tackle very different aspects of this problem in very different ways. I think this work is a timely contribution as it tries to unify all these previous approaches in a single more \u201cglobal\u201d lens. The authors also show great knowledge of the related works, covering most of the contributions to this problem.\n2. I really find the result in Theorem 4 quite interesting and also somewhat surprising. I think this is actually the core result of this work although it is not really highlighted like that."

                "value": "1. I find the claims in this work somewhat misleading. The main contribution is the fact that if the posterior is not underfitting, then there is no cold posterior effect. But this statement is almost trivial as (almost) all that is to prove is already assumed in the statement. Underfitting, as defined by the authors, means \u201ca model having training and testing losses much higher than they could be i.e. there exists another model in the model class having simultaneously lower training and testing losses.\u201d Taking the opposite, no underfitting basically means that there is no model with better train and test loss, hence if the Bayesian posterior is not underfitting then of course there is no cold posterior effect. Am I missing something here? \u2028The authors then show that posteriors with smaller temperature having smaller training loss, which is not surprising since the effect of the prior is essentially down-weighted and the model concentrates more on the likelihood, which exactly guarantees a better fit. This, not very surprising fact does all the heavy-lifting here: If one now assumes CPE, then yes, there is a model with smaller temperature and better test loss, which also has smaller training loss but again, not much has been shown here. I also find all the mathematical notation more confusing than helpful here, it makes this relatively simple fact seem more complicated than it really is. I think my issues are somewhat addressed by Theorem 4 which seems to more strongly show the claims made **before** presenting it. I would really appreciate if the authors could clear up my confusion as to what is assumed when words like \u201cunderfitting\u201d are used, and what is proved rigorously. \n2. Theorem 4 is a very interesting result and I would have loved to see some empirical verification of it, i.e. if the posterior is optimal at $\\lambda = 1$, does the train loss really not change anymore if you add a new sample to the posterior (of course one would need to average over adding the sample)? Can you basically predict optimality of $\\lambda=1$ from this property alone? \n3. I think one important theoretical work in the literature regarding the origins of CPE in conjunction with data augmentation has not been treated in this work. While you cite [1] for re-scaling the prior, you don\u2019t discuss their results regarding data augmentation and how the correlations of errors, arising from assigning the same label to augmented samples, influences the resulting posterior. It is not obvious to me at first glance how those results can be casted within the under-fitting hypothesis of this work, especially the correlated nature of the data. Could you elaborate on the connection to your work?\n\n\n[1] Bachmann et al., How Tempering Fixes Data Augmentation in Bayesian Neural Networks"
