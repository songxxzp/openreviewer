Domain generalization is a machine learning technique designed to train models for effective performance on unfamiliar data originating from multiple domains or distributions. As such, it covers a broad and diverse research landscape, accommodating various scenarios and types of data shift. To enhance reader comprehension and provide a more thorough context, it would be beneficial for the authors to initiate with a comprehensive overview of domain generalization before delving into the specific scenario they focus on, which involves challenges such as label noise, spurious correlation, and subpopulation shifts. This approach can mitigate potential misunderstandings and offer a more holistic understanding for the readers.\n\nW2 -  The paper primarily presents an empirical analysis, and it is commendable that the authors have incorporated a diverse set of datasets, which enhances the generalizability of their findings. However, it's worth noting that the diversity observed in the choice of datasets is not reflected in the selection of Domain Generalization (DG) methods considered for the analysis. In order to strengthen the general statements proposed in the paper, it would be valuable to expand the range of DG algorithms under examination. This broader inclusion of methods can further validate and reinforce the claims made in the paper, offering a more comprehensive view of the research landscape.\n\nW3 - The experiments of the paper are limited to tasks related to image classification, with no inclusion of other types of data, such as tabular data.
