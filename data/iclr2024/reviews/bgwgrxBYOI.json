The main adaptation in the architecture is simply embedding a discretized Laplacian structure in the convolution filters in order to reduce the total number of parameters in the model. \n* The problem setting is too simplistic to demonstrate significance. The authors exclusively focus on the linear heat equation with nonhomogeneous unknown coefficients, which is nowhere near the complexity of the other problems referenced, including Navier-Stokes and weather/climate. The heat equation has linear dynamics and generally admits smooth solutions, which means errors do not accumulate over time in complicated ways and solution has very little small-scaled features (so that representing the solution/dynamics fields is relatively easy). The claim that it is \"complex enough\" (page 4 top) is too much of a stretch. It is certainly not evident that the same OOD generalization might be observed on, for example, turbulent flows.\n\nLess fundamental concerns:\n* Baselines: FCN should not be considered a valid baseline if the dynamics is known to be local. In addition, the both FCN and ConvN show signs of overfitting, which suggests the architecture/training is sub-optimal. Techniques such as layer/group normalizations and learning rate annealing should at least be considered."

Overall, the method in its current form lacks generality as a general subgrid method. This aspect could be improved, e.g., by considering a more general approach (or meta-method) that can build physics priors into more general kinds of equations.\n\nSoundness: the paper lacks comparison with some important baselines, e.g., Fourier Neural Operators and U-Net.
