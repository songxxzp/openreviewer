Moreover, GPT-4's capacity to follow up with the VLM for additional information or clarification further enhances the quality of the obtained responses. Second,  GPT-4 is prompted to generate robot task code that imitates the demonstrated actions. The approach is evaluated on the EPIC-Kitchens dataset, outperforming other methods. Key contributions include a new framework for transforming vision-language demonstrations into state-action sequences, annotated data for benchmarking, and superior performance in both state-action and code generation tasks."

The techniques the authors introduced over the Socratic Model, namely the way to structure and prompt the LLM / VLM interaction doesn't seem to constitute enough contribution to be an ICLR paper.\n\n- The evaluation itself relies on GPT, which is a bit weak despite the human annotation the authors provide. If the authors had proposed a structured output format like those used in VQA and have more annotations the evaluation would be much stronger. \n\n- There are also a few misleading claims. Throughout the paper, the authors talks about constructing \"state-action\" pairs, while in reality what they extract are some loose-form text predicates as well as loose-form text actions. Such abusive use of terms misleads the readers when they read the abstract.\n\nOverall, I think the current status of the paper lacks the significance an ICLR paper would need."

For instance, the reference code uses functions like \u201ccheck_if_dirty(object)\u201d, a level of abstraction for which we do not have good robot behaviors. In a sense, the method performs a kind of task-level planning. But the level of abstraction of this planning makes it impossible to test in a control setup. \n3. **Unclear motivation**: The authors claim that this work tries to ground videos into state actions and states for robot demos. Unfortunately, this is simply not true. They describe the state in videos using text and ground actions into pseudo-code. This far from the promise of a state-action demonstration. \n4. **No robotic evaluations**: The paper does not run any experiments on robots - neither in simulation nor on real robots. Therefore, I believe calling this a method to generate state-action demonstrations is an overclaim.\n5. **Extremely expensive to deploy on a robot**: The method requires making several calls per time step of execution to GPT-4 making this very very expensive."
