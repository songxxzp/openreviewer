Even if it has, the contribution will still be limited. \n2. Sec 5 only addresses the empirical understanding rather than theoretical."

                "value": "1. (For weakness 1) Why using energy score with trainable temperature for energy-score is better than the OOD score in generalized ODIN? Maybe following this idea? What determines the performance in energy score is mainly the logsumexp of the logits, rather than temperature. Thus, its analysis was mainly in the denominator of the softmax function and temperature does not play a major role there. Given this fact/approximation, I feel like the function $\\hat f_{y_i}(x_i; \\theta)$ (just below equ(1)) could be analyzed similarly. Taking the log of $\\hat f_{y_i}(x_i; \\theta)$, we will have two terms, one of which will be the AbeT score. \n2. Given the similarity between Generalized ODIN and energy score, it seems the really interesting result to me is it seems it does not need OOD samples during training.  (2.1) Can you confirm this? (2.2) If so, can you explain why the trained temperature only could change the OOD performance theoretically? If this explanation is convincing, it may be more important than the empirical perspectives of the methods."

Crucially, it proposes a simple adjustment to the way energy score is computed with temperature parameters, leading to empirically demonstrated gains. AbeT significantly reduces false positives in classification, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. It also offers insights into how it learns to distinguish ID and OOD samples. Moreover, AbeT demonstrates improved performance in object detection and semantic segmentation tasks, making it a valuable tool for model robustness in critical domains."
