The experimental results suggest that $a_{ij}^{g}$ is extracted from $m_i$, yet this section lacks explicit clarification.\n\n(2) It is unclear whether the two layer neural network $g$ should be trained or directly be used from other previous works. It is mentioned that weight vectors $w_r$ are learnable vectors. Are these weights and the neural network trained by the consistency loss?\n\n(3) The consistency loss implies that each head is trained on all the domains with different weights. This is similar to the case where each head is trained on all the domains with a weighted combination of the losses of all the domains. For the predictor $f^{(d)}$, the loss is in this form: $l(\\frac{\\sum_j^{N^{tr}} a_{dj} f^{(d)}(x^j)}{\\sum_j^{N_{tr}} a_{dj}})$. Would this loss also help the learning of domain-specific models?\n\n(4) Suppose that each head is trained on all the domains by the loss function (2). In this case, regardless of the values of $a_{ij}$, if both the supervised loss and consistency loss reach their minimum, then the learning of $a_{ij}$ would be useless. Does the proposed method face this issue?\n\n(5) In the experiment section, one baseline of the proposed method would be training each head on all the training domains by supervised loss and averaging the predictions of these heads as the test prediction."

Will the method perform as well as a domain-invariant approach? Is this what the consistency loss is for?\n* If domain information was unavailable, could a domain discovery method (e.g. clustering) be used to learn domains and domain relations from unlabeled data? In the limit, could the model architecture and inference algorithm be adapted to learn domains and domain relations end-to-end?\n* Could this method be used in data impoverished applications to improve performance? \n\nMinor typos:\n* Equations are referenced with \"Eqn. equation #\", maybe just \"(#)\" or \"Equation (#)\"?"

                "value": "This paper attempts to solve the multi-source multi-target domain generalization problem using domain relations. The authors claim that existing single domain-invariant or multiple domain-specific models that leverage equal weights on all domains fail to capture appropriate domain-specific correlations. To tackle this problem, the authors extract domain relations from domain meta-data and design a relation-aware consistency regularizer to weight the training domain-specific functions. The weighted functions on source domains are then transferred to predictions on target domains. A theoretical analysis is provided to prove that the proposed approach can perform better than the models using equal domain weights."

The authors provide a theoretical analysis that verifies that the proposed relation-aware consistency loss can achieve superior generalization performance compared to the approach of treating all training domains\nequally. \n\n3. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and thorough. An illustrative toy task is designed to examine the proposed methods and many tables and figures are presented to analyze the results."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The novelty of the proposed method may be somewhat limited as it bears similarities to ensemble methods, which also involve assigning varying weights to different domains. The essential distinctions between the proposed methods and ensemble methods should be clearly elucidated, and it is important to consider baseline models that incorporate ensemble methods for comparison.\n\n2. The evaluation metrics used in this paper are different from previous works conducted on the TPT-48, FMoW, and ChEMBL-STRING datasets. It is unclear whether the metrics used, such as MSE, are suitable and fair to be used to evaluate domain generalization models.\n\n3. As stated by the authors, the theoretical analysis of this paper relies on certain assumptions. It is questioning whether these assumptions reflect the real-world datasets. For example, the assumptions that the domain relations accurately capture the similarity between domains, and that they are determined solely by the distance between domain representations, may not always hold true in real-world datasets. In the proofs of the theorems, the authors only prove that the proposed estimator outperforms the equally weighted estimator in the minimax sense, but not a theoretically global superiority. Moreover, the theorems only reveal that uneven weights can be better than equal weights, which does not entirely support the key ideas of acquiring appropriate weights for different domains."
