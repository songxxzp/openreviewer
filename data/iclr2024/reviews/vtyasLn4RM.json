A diagram of the whole algorithm should be carefully introduced in this section, which can make the readers clearer to the proposed algorithm before diving into the details. It is difficult to understand the pipeline of CoReGD from Figure 2, e.g., h_1^1, h_1^l, h_1^{c+1}.\n* I find the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical optimization in Table 2 and Figure 6. However, the proposed positional rewiring, scale-invariant stress, and replay buffer do not make a significant impact on the stress metric from A.3 Table 3.\n* More graph drawing quality metrics can be reported, such as shape-based metrics and edge crossing."

Some of the features that offer high discriminability might be difficult/expensive to compute for large graphs (e.g. Laplacian PEs or beacons). \n\n- The random noise addition step in 3.2 is interesting: this would means the output drawing is stochastic, I guess.  How sensitive are output drawing configurations to the noise introduced here?  \n\n- Section 3's overview of Core-GD is quite hard to understand.  Some design choices aren't obvious to the reader: (i) why do we need two convolutions (Conv_E and Conv_R), (ii) what's the purpose of the rewiring module?  How exactly does the GRU fit in?  Structuring this section with equations which the reader can follow from inputs to position coordinates would have probably helped understand the sequence of operations\n\n- Table 1 suggests that Core-GD seems to achieve similar performance to DeepGD -- I'm not familiar with the differences with these methods, but some discussion regarding the speed advantages of CoreGD compared to DeepGD would be helpful to contextualize the added value of using the algorithm proposed by the authors.  \n\n- Being able to coarsen aggressively before initializing input features seems like a great advantage for large graphs -- I'm curious what the largest graph the authors were able to visualize with CoreGD is given this benefit.  The graphs in Table 1 seem to be mostly small -- are other graph drawing approaches (non-neural or neural) better able to support larger graphs?  In general, a runtime-stress curve which shows the relative performance of multiple methods would be really helpful to see where CoreGD lies on the frontier.\n\n---\n\nUpdated my score after reading the authors' responses."
