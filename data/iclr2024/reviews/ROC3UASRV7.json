This type of algorithm learns a classifier on the domain that predicts optimality, and alternates between updating that classifier and updating the best solution found so far. The paper has two main contributions: 1) a novel learning theoretical analysis and 2) a modification of an existing algorithm with better learning bounds achieved by shrinking the region where the best solution may be found so far. Experiments on DFO benchmarks and LLMs show that the proposed algorithm RACE-CARS improves over the modified algorithm SRACOS and CMA-ES (which is computationally expensive). Ablations of the hyperparameters are also done."

As a result, the term  $\\frac{1}{| \\Omega  _ {\\epsilon}  |}  $ in the complexity bound  equals to  $\\frac{1}{| \\Omega  _ {\\epsilon}  |} =  (\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})^n $, which grows exponentially for $\\epsilon < 1$. \n\n2. $\\textbf{Impractical Assumptions}$\n\n The Hypothesis-Target  $\\eta$-Shattering assumption in Definition 3.1 together with the $\\gamma$-Shrinking assumption in Definition 2.3 are too strong to be practical.  The Hypothesis-Target  $\\eta$-Shattering assumption requires the classifier prediction to have at least a $\\eta$ overlap with the true $\\epsilon$-solution domain $\\Omega  _ {\\epsilon}  $.   In the above example,  the size of $\\Omega  _ {\\epsilon}  $ decay exponentially w.r.t. the dimension $n$ , which requires the classifier to be very accurate or to have high positive prediction percentage ($h(x) =1$). \n\nIn addition, $\\gamma$-Shrinking assumption requires the region of the positive prediction to have a $\\gamma$-shrinking for all $t$.  As a result, the region of the positive prediction exponentially decays w.r.t. $t$,  i.e., $\\gamma^t$.  However, the  Hypothesis-Target  $\\eta$-Shattering assumption requires to have at least a $\\eta$ overlap with the true $\\epsilon$-solution domain $\\Omega  _ {\\epsilon}  $,  which requires a very strong classifier for high-dimensional problems. However, how to achieve a  strong classifier with limited training samples for high-dimensional problems is challenging.  \n\n3. $\\textbf{No Convergence Guarantee}$.\n\nThe complexity analysis can not guarantee convergence as $t$ tends to infinity.   In Theorem 3.3, the left-hand side of the inequality decays exponentially fast w.r.t $t$. However,  the RHS of the inequality can not guarantee an exponential decay. \n\n4. In the black-box tuning task, only the SST2 dataset is employed. The evaluation on a single dataset is not convincing enough to support the claim.  \n\n5. The paper is not well-organized. The experimental results are placed in the Appendix instead of the main paper."
