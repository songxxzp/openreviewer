            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- My main concern is I'm not sure what the utility of feature accentuation is. A good chunk of the experiments focuses on natural-looking images, but I'm slightly less concerned about that. It's certainly a desirable property -- to look more natural and less like hallucinations. However, I'm not sure how this helps us, concretely: Can this help us improve accuracy? Diagnose mistakes? (This is suggested in several of the figures) Suggest a path for fixing the model? (Maybe by pruning \"wrong\" nodes?) There's a preview of this in figures 9 and 10, but the utility isn't studied in the paper. [1] for example has several approaches for defining and quantifying interpretability/utility of a method.\n- Along the lines of the above, I'm not sure how to use the information these visualizations provide. For example, in figure 9, for \"bow\" vs. \"chainsaw\", I can certainly see that the \"chainsaw\" visualization is more chainsaw-like, but couldn't I just pull a random other word and visualize that? For example, I could feature accentuate \"matchsticks\" or \"juggler fire torches\", and I'm not sure how any of those visualizations would help me diagnose mistakes in the original model. Another way to put this would be: If I feature accentuate something clearly unrelated, eg.., \"snail\" for the \"bow\" image, it seems like this method would find *some way to insert a snail, but what does that tell me exactly, if I can insert any concept into the image? (One possibility is that natural looking insertions are \"valid\" explanations, and grotesque abstract art is unrelated? This would need some more fleshing out though, but that would be one way). On a side note, the main utility in figures 9 and 10 is ironically that it highlights some part of the original image, like saliency maps. (I'm not sure how important it is to be able to modify the image, per the above). A study would probably need to show that the image modification is helpful too.\n- Have you tried the sanity checks in [2]? I know [2] is actually cited in your related works. Although feature accentuation is not a saliency map per se, the randomized tests in that paper should still apply. It would help (partially) my concerns above if the method does pass sanity checks -- in that it shows there *is meaning.\n\n[1] Poursabzi-Sangdeh, et al.

A less positive view could be that this means the technique is finding local minima that will fail to generalize.\n- Figure 8: what are the smooth curves, and how were their hyperparameters chosen?
