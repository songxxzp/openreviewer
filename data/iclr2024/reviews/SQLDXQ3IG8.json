However, since the attack intensity $\\alpha$ needs to take a very small value, such an expansion does not have great technical difficulty and contribution.\n\n3: While the authors claim that the results in this paper are applicable to any width, for overparameterized networks which $m\\gg n, d$, the results presented may lack significance.\n\n4: The discussion of overfitting with adversarial training is unconvincing. Such a discussion can only show that the results of this paper are not inconsistent with the phenomenon in [3], but it still cannot provide a reasonable explanation for the phenomenon in [3]."
