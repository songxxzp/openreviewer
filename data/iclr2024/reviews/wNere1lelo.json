                "value": "### Originality\n\n**Q1: The claimed \"certified\" defense is essentially an exhaustive search of the original unperturbed prompt.**\n\nI am a bit concerned about the novelty of this paper, since the proposed \"certified\" defense is essentially an exhaustive search to recover the original unperturbed prompt. This notion is different from the compared randomized smoothing (Q7), which leverages random sampling and the Neyman-Pearson lemma to estimate the probabilistic certificate. While it is okay for the proposed certificate to be deterministic (since there are many deterministic certified defenses for vision models), its practical time complexity only comes from the two simplified attack settings (Q2-3). Given this, it is not very convincing that a simple exhaustive search would provide much novelty, unless there are other key contributions that I miss.\n\n### Quality\n\n**Q2: The defense assumes invalid knowledge of the attack's setting.**\n\nThis paper correctly defines three attack modes with increased generalizability, namely adversarial suffix, insertion, and infusion. However, the defense was incorrectly discussed and evaluated with the knowledge of which attack was defended against. For example, how would the defense ensure that the attacker injected an adversarial suffix rather than something else? Given an adversarial prompt, a reasonable certificate from this defense is that the prompt does not contain an adversarial suffix up to a certain length, but that guarantee is attack-specific, and hence the safety against other kinds of attacks is still unknown. Note that RS certifies against *any* perturbation produced by *any* attack within an L2 radius, or would this paper justify that the difference between suffix/insertion attacks is similar to that between L2/Linf attacks?\n\n**Q3: The combinational searching space is impractical.**\n\nThe general case incurs a combinational search space due to the defense's exhaustive search design. First, this is the exact case that a defense should focus on, as the defense does not know the attack's (easier) mode beforehand. Second, the authors did not report the original unperturbed prompt's length $n$ anywhere in the paper (if I did not miss it), which worsens the practicability. Assuming the original prompt has 100 tokens and 5 tokens are randomly injected, the search space would be ${100 \\choose 5}\\approx75M$ subsequences. I find it hard to justify the practicability of this search space.\n\n**Q4: The safety filter's FPR will escalate with the search space.**\n\nOne key metric not discussed in the paper is the safety filter's false positive rate, or the percentage of safe prompts classified as malicious by Llama 2. This is important because the FPR will likely escalate as the search space increases, especially given that the defense would determine the prompt as harmful when any one of the testing subsequences is predicted as harmful. For example, say the FPR is $p$, the overall FPR for $d$ safe subsequences (of one original safe prompt) would be $1 - (1-p)^d$, which grows exponentially in the number of subsequences. Even with an initial $p=0.01$, the final FPR for $d=20$ would be around 0.182.\n\nThis is more impractical when the search space is combinational (Q3). While this is justified in the paper, I do not think one could train a sufficiently precise classifier with some exponentially low FPR: the classifier cannot make *any* mistake in $\\mathcal{O}(n^d)$ subsequences.\n\n**Q5: Theorem 1 is based on \"is-harmful\", but the evaluation focused on \"not is-harmful.\"**\n\nBelow Theorem 1, it is claimed that \"to certify the performance ... on *harmful prompts*, we just need to evaluate the safety filter on *those prompts*.\" But all experiments (the green bars) evaluate the safety filter on *safe prompts*. It seems that the authors only evaluated 500 harmful prompts in one line and obtained 93% accuracy. On the accuracy side, this is apparent, as the exhaustive search will eventually recover the original prompt and make that much accuracy. But then the overall evaluation is more or less reduced to a benchmark of Llama-2. I wonder if the authors could evaluate the LHS of Theorem 1, which is the factual performance of this defense.\n\n**Q6: The adaptation of Randomized Smoothing is unfair and was only compared in suffix attacks.**\n\nThe design of RS is to sample around the given input and estimate a certifiable radius. For example, given an adversarial image, RS samples isotropic noisy points around the adversarial point, rather than constructively removing adversarial pixels from the image. Yet Section 4.2 adopts RS to drop a fixed set of tokens (rather than some more balanced or randomized sets) and apply majority vote. This adaptation (majority vote) is undoubtedly worse than the proposed \"veto\" strategy. It is thus suggested to discuss the validity of the current adaptation of RS in LLMs. For example, one direct adaptation of RS is to randomly drop/add tokens (as a way to sample the neighborhood) and apply majority vote.\n\n### Clarity\n\n**Q7: Missing a critical evaluation setting -- the prompt's length.**\n\nSee Q3.\n\n**Q8: Unclear soundnesses of the insight that \"subsequences of safe prompts are also safe\" due to FPR.**\n\nThe whole defense relies on the insight that \"subsequences of safe prompts are also safe.\" This is conceptually correct, but is unlikely the case, given there is no perfect classifier to realize the claim. In practice, subsequences of safe prompts are not always \"predicted as\" safe.\n\n### Significance\n\n**Q9: The defense's practicability and claimed guarantee is limited.**\n\nOverall, the provided guarantee is only over a small set of attacks, but the compared RS is for any attacks. This somewhat reduces the significance of this work, as the defender is not assured of safety against other kinds of attacks (with the same number of adversarial tokens). The claimed \"certifying\" concept is also different from the conventional concept in randomized smoothing and largely trivial due to the exhaustive search, which requires some justification."

While there are clear positives, such as the novelty of the approach and problem setting, the writing, the consideration of different threat models, and the idea of providing provable guarantees in this setting, there are a number of drawbacks.  These include shortcomings of the main property that motivates the method, confusion about the use of the word \"token\" and some weaknesses in the experiments.  Altogether, given these weaknesses, I'm leaning toward rejection, but I look forward to a discussion with the authors and the other reviewers."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**\"Fundamental property.\"**  The authors base their `erase-and-check` algorithm on the following observation:\n\n> \"Our procedure leverages a fundamental property of safe prompts: Subsequences of safe prompts are also safe. This property allows it to achieve strong certified safety guarantees on harmful prompts while maintaining good empirical performance on safe prompts.\"\n\nI'm not sure whether this \"fundamental property\" is true.  As an example, consider the following sentence: \"How did you make this pizza, it's the bomb!\"  This prompt is safe, and a subsequence of this prompt is \"How did you make the bomb,\" which is an unsafe prompt.  One way to clarify this issue would be to define what it means for a string to be \"safe.\"  \n\n**Tokens vs. characters.**  I was confused about what is meant by the word \"tokens\" in this paper.  Two definitions seem possible:\n\n1. *Tokens as strings.* One interpretation of the word \"token\" is that one token is equivalent to one character in an input prompt.  This seems to be the sense in which \"token\" is used in the paper, given the example at the top of page 2.  However, if this is the definition meant by the authors, then there is a slight mischaracterization of past work.  That is, the authors say that \"[The GCG] method achieves a high attack success rate, of up to 84%, even on black-box LLMs such as GPT-3.5 using adversarial sequences that are only 20 tokens long.\"  However, the GCG paper regards tokens as integers; an input string is mapped by a tokenizer to a list of integers.  Generally speaking, GCG attacks are optimized over 20 integer tokens, which are mapped to ~150-200 tokens by the decoder.  So if one token == one integer, then the GCG attack actually uses ~150-200 tokens, and given the query complexity of this method, one would imagine that scaling to such attacks would be challenging.\n2. *Tokens as integers.* If the authors use tokens to refer to integers, as is done in the GCG paper, then this filtering method is no longer black-box, since one needs access to the tokenization of input prompts to conduct the defense.  \n\nMy understanding is that point 1 is the sense meant by the authors.  In either case, it would be worth clarifying the definition of \"token.\"\n\n**What is meant by \"certified\" robustness?**  It's unclear to me what \"certification\" means in this paper.  The `erase-and-check` method depends on the `is-harmful` filter.  If this filter were deterministic, i.e., it returned True if and only if a prompt was harmful by some objective standard (assuming that this exists at all), then one would expect the `erase-and-check` method to filter all possible attacks.  However, as the authors are using Llama2 as the safety filter, the certification \"guarantee\" is only valid *with respect to Llama2*.  This contrasts with the meaning of \"certification\" in the adversarial robustness literature, wherein methods like randomized smoothing give a guarantee that *any* input perturbation of a particular size will not change the classification.  More generally, since there is no objective truth WRT what is safe/unsafe, it might be worth choosing words other than \"certified\" and \"guarantee,\" since the meaning of safety is somewhat subjective in this context.\n\n**Shortcomings of `erase-and-check`.**\n\n* *Knowledge of the attack.*  To run `erase-and-check`, one needs to know the threat model.  Specifically, one needs knowledge of how the attacker will perturb the input prompt, e.g., by adding a suffix, by infusing random characters, etc.  This information will not be known in practice, and therefore its unclear how one would go about using this method in practice.  One would also need to know $d$, the number of characters added to the input prompt.\n* *Query complexity.*  One shortcoming of the proposed method is its query complexity.  If one did have knowledge of the complete threat model (c.f., the above bullet point), then one would still need to check a potentially exponential list of suffixes, which seems especially large for the latter two threat models discussed in the paper.  \n* *`is-harmful` filter construction.*  Based on my understanding, it's unclear to me how the safety filter should be chosen.  The authors use Llama2, but other choices seem possible.  One could use a different LLM, or train a classifier, or use the string checking method used in the GCG paper.  It would be good to do an ablation here and to discuss why one might prefer one method over the others, or whether ensembling these models would be preferable.\n\n**Experiments.**\n\n* *How were the suffixes generated?*  The authors compare to the GCG attack throughout the paper.  However, as discussed above, the GCG attack produces suffixes that are often 200 characters long, and in the paper, the suffixes seem to be 20 characters long.  Did the authors (a) run GCG to obtain the suffixes or (b) generate the suffixes in some other way?  Point (b) seems to be supported by, \"We evaluated is-harmful on a randomly sampled set of 500 harmful prompts from AdvBench.\"  Is the randomness over the sampling of the prompts from AdvBench or over the sampling of the suffixes themselves?  If the suffixes were generated randomly, it would be necessary to see if these strings elicited objectionable responses when appended onto the AdvBench prompts and passed through an LLM.  My guess is that random generation will result in lower ASRs than the GCG attack, but that's just a hunch.\n* *Comparisons to past work.*  Since the authors imply a comparison to GCG (\"We evaluated is-harmful on the 500 harmful behavior instruction prompts created by Zou et al. (2023) as part of their AdvBench dataset and observed an accuracy of 93%. For comparison, an adversarial suffix of length 20 can make the accuracy on harmful prompts as low as 16% for GPT-3.5\"), it would be worth clarifying if they are referring to the same kind of attack.  In general, it's unclear to me how these figures of 93% ASR for GCG and 16% attack detection are comparable, especially if the suffixes in this paper were generated randomly.  Could the authors clarify this?\n* *Adaptive attacks.*  It would also be worth thinking about *adaptive attacks* for this method.  Adaptive attacks are common in the adversarial robustness literature, wherein one attacks a defended classifier.  Would it be possible to attack the `erase-and-check` method, particularly if a differentiable function like Llama2 is used in the `is-harmful` filter?  At the very least, it would be worth discussing adaptive attacks, if not adding some experiments to address this aspect.\n* *Evaluation metrics.*  It seemed like there could be more appropriate choices for the evaluation metrics. The authors compute accuracies for whether safe prompts are labeled safe and unsafe prompts are labeled unsafe.  But this seems like a situation in which something like the $F_1$ score would make more sense.  More generally, it would be good to look at the true/false positives/negatives to get a sense of the trade-offs encountered when using this method.  \n* *Attack detection.*  Most of the plots concern time-complexity and \"clean\" performance on safe prompts.  But the plots do not reflect the attack detection rate, which I would have thought would have been the main experiment.  It's not clear how the attack detection rate fluctuates with $d$ or between the different threat models.  Adding a discussion of this would strengthen the paper.\n* *Baseline algorithm.*  I'm not sure I understood the construction of the baseline.  Although it is called \"randomized smoothing,\" as the authors note, it is not random.  Indeed, one could view this method as averaging, whereas the `erase-and-check` method is using a max operator; it's the difference between a detection holding on average vs. a detection holding $\\forall$ inputs.  From this view, it seems definite that this baseline will *always* perform worse than `erase-and-check`, since it requires a strictly less granular filtering operation.\n\n**Minor points.**\n\n* I think that $n$ is defined on Section 3, but it is used throughout Section 2.\n* The notation switches in Section 5.

Recent work has shown that it can be relatively straightforward to bypass model alignment, where the language model generates obviously problematic completions. To my knowledge, this paper proposes the first method to certify that a harmful prompt is not misclassified as safe.  This makes the work a valuable contribution and potentially a good candidate for publication at ICLR.\n\nErase-and-check is a simple, intuitive method for achieving robustness. It applies standard ideas similar to other adversarial robustness, including for L0 robustness (e.g., [1]).  Simplicity is a strength, but overall the idea and theoretical results are rather straightforward.\n\n#### References\n\n[1] Huang et. al. \"RS-Del: Edit Distance Robustness Certificates for Sequence Classifiers via Randomized Deletion\" NeurIPS 2023 (to appear)."

                "value": "Potential weaknesses are also raised in the \"Questions\" section below.\n\nThe title of the paper, \"*Certifying LLM Safety against Adversarial Prompting*\". In my view, this title is too broad and implies the work achieves more than it does (i.e., overclaims).  The paper defends against a specific type of adversarial prompting -- token insertions.  For example, consider the \"*jailbreak via mismatched generalization*\" attack in Wei et al. [2].  Their attack is simple and effective; however, this paper's method would not be expected to work well against it.  For vision domains, there are standard conventions to define different types of robustness (e.g., $\\ell_2$. $\\ell_\\infty$).  To my knowledge, there is no such standard nomenclature for prompt robustness.  In the absence of that, the authors need to be especially explicit early on (e.g., in the abstract) about the robustness paradigms their defense considers and, more importantly, those that the defense does not.  The paper does not really discuss the types of attacks where the defense does not work.  \n\nThe authors use the open-source Llama 2 language model as their harmfulness detector.  I understand the choice, and agree it is reasonable because it is unlikely many can train their own harmfulness detector. However, using an open-source LM inherently poses a risk.  An adaptive attacker aware of the author(s)'s defense could craft prompts using Llama 2, reducing the empirical effectiveness of the defense in practice.  Unless the Zou et al. (2023) AdvBench dataset already tunes the attacks using Llama 2, the authors should add such an experiment to the paper. \n* To clarify, I recognize the guarantees would still hold, but I expect the actual *numerical performance* would decline, potentially substantially.\n\nOn page 2, the authors write,\n\n> *The safety certificate of our procedure guarantees that harmful prompts are not misclassified as safe under an adversarial attack.*\n\nI found this description of your method's guarantees well-written and clear.  In particular, I found this description a good deal clearer and more precise than the description in the abstract, where I found the intent of your method harder to parse and understand on a single read-through.  I recommend replacing the language in the abstract with the quote above.\n\n\nOn page 6, the authors write,\n\n> ...we tested our procedure on 200 safe prompts generated using ChatGPT for different values of the maximum erase length between 0 and 30.  \n\nThe paper should contain a short description detailing how the criteria used to generate these safe prompts.  Specifying that ChatGPT was used provides very little insight to the reader.  The authors should summarize the prompt generation criteria so readers do not need to read the clean prompts to build an intuition about their form.  \n* I appreciate the authors provided the clean prompts in their supplemental materials. I assume the authors will include these clean prompts if the paper is accepted for publication -- correct me if I am wrong.\n\n\n#### References\n\n[2] Alexander Wei, Nika Haghtalab, and Jacob Steinhardt.

                "value": "On page 2, you write, \n\n> *Our procedure leverages a fundamental property of safe prompts: Subsequences of safe prompts are also safe.*\n\nNote there is a similar statement in the conclusions.  I agree this property is *generally* true, though there are counterexamples where it isn't. For example, \"Do not write '[SomethingEvil]'\" is a safe prompt.  \"write '[SomethingEvil]'\" is a subsequence but is not safe.  Perhaps we have different definitions of what constitutes a \"**fundamental property**\" and whether such a property can be violated.  Nonetheless, this statement needs more precision as a less careful reader may not realize this property may not always hold.\n\nSubroutine `is-harmful` checks whether some (sub)prompt is harmful.  Am I correct in assuming that your method implicitly assumes that `is-harmful` is a deterministic function?  Reading your paper, I interpret the guarantees that your method provides as deterministic (as opposed to probabilistic).  If `is-harmful` is not deterministic, then it seems your guarantees would be probabilistic only -- correct me if I am wrong.  \n* The author(s)'s implementation uses Llama 2 for the `is-harmful` method.  Therefore, for their `is-harmful` to be deterministic, the LM's hyperparameters/settings must be set appropriately to ensure determinism.  \n* I do not recall the authors discussing this point generally or in the context of their empirical evaluation.\n\nI had some difficulty interpreting the results in Figure 3(b).  The caption specifies that the figure shows the running time of `erase-and-check` (i.e., the whole algorithm) in suffix mode on clean prompts.  I would have expected that the time needed to certify deleting 20 tokens would be roughly double the time needed to certify 10 tokens since suffix mode's complexity is $O(d)$.  However, the figure shows the certification time for 10, 20, or 30 tokens is nearly identical.  Does Figure 3(b) visualize `erase-and-check`'s whole running time or for just one of $O(d)$ prompts?\n* I am not sure what is wrong here, but the clarity needs to be improved.\n\nI do not believe I saw your `is_harmful` prompt in the supplement paper.  I spent a little time searching through your code but did not quickly find it.  Please specify this in the supplement so readers know if you are using zero-shot, few-shot, something else, etc."
