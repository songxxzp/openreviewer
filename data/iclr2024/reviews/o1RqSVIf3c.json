It may also be helpful to do some ablation studies and see how each level of approximation affects the overall performance.\n* How does sampling compare to the analytical solution?\n  * A comparison to sampling is missing from the experiments. This is important for validating the quality of the approximate analytical solution as well as the computational efficiency claims.\n* Complexity:\n  * It would be good to state the overall complexity of: pair choice, posterior update, and recourse generation\n  * Solving an optimization problem for each possible value of m (|m_{t-1}-d| values) seems expensive\n  * Comparing N^2 pairs each turn seems expensive\n  * Problem 7b is an integer linear program, which is NP-hard in general, so the statement about the solution being computationally efficient seem exaggerated (especially with no detailed complexity analysis). It should be at least possible to show empirically which problem sizes can be handled and at what cost.\n* Choice of x points:\n  * Does it make sense to consider negative-negative pairs? Or choosing unlabeled points for comparison? It would be good to justify the positive-positive choice.\n  * The graph-based approach of section 5  considers only transitions between points from the training data, but it may be possible to transition to new points not in the data (possibly unrealizable). Can such transitions be accommodated in your framework? If we have access to the classifier we can know the label of any point.\n  * What are typical path lengths in the experiments?\n* Section 6.1:\n  * What is the dimension d?\n  * The model seems rather small (90 neurons in 3 MLP layers)\n  * What is the justification for the choice \\tau\\kappa=1?\n\nMinor/Typos:\n==========\n* Eq (2): I could not find b\n* Eq (3): nit - missing \u201c(\u201c for R_ij\n* Why not define z_i and z_j earlier and simplify notation, for example in \\sigma_i and \\sigma_j, and in M_ij?\n* Showing validity results in Tables 1 and 2 (and 4 and 5) seems redundant since they are always 1. This can be stated once in the text. Also, x_r is chosen such that it returns a positive prediction, so it is not clear when that would not be the case.\n* Section 6.3: \u201cconsistent decrease as the number of questions increases\u201d is a bit overstated, it seems that in most plots the rank increases initially before decreasing."

The main message of the main theorem of this paper is hard to follow. In (2) of Theorem 3.2, I don't believe any author could easily figure out the asymptotic manner of this probability (either it's a constant, close to 0, or close to 1?). \n\n3. Following 2, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is unclear and there is no analysis on how many samples (how large $M$) are needed for the algorithm.\n\n4. It's not clear what is the difference between the proposed algorithm with FACE. Does FACE also use shortest path? If so, what's their cost?\n\n------------------------- For Experiments -------------------------\n\n1. I don't think the proposed algorithm is better than the baselines because it has almost the same cost as FACE if using $\\ell_1$ as the true cost. The improvement in Mahalanobis distance as the true cost is not compatible because this is the same distance used in the algorithm and to some extent, the algorithm cracks the ground truth.\n\n 2. Why the baselines are not compared in Section 6.3?\n\n3. (Minor) I suggest moving other baselines (Appendix D.2) to the main text.\n\n\n------------------------- For Theoretical Analysis -------------------------\n\n1.
