Notably, both Branch 1 and Branch 2 share an identical architecture, differing only in their input, which comprises the forcing term and the boundary condition.\n  - As illustrated in Figure 1, it seems that the encoding of boundary conditions is achieved using a shared transformer, while the forcing term employs two distinct MPNNs. Is this particular choice of architecture a necessary one?\n- Despite the acknowledged disadvantages of concatenating the boundary conditions alongside the other inputs, it is indeed surprising to see the catastrophic failure of recent advances, such as MP-PDE, as illustrated, especially in Figure 5. The authors have mentioned that the learning rate and the weight decay factor are fixed for all experiments through grid search, but it remains unclear with which model these hyperparameters are searched for. Furthermore, aligning optimization hyperparameters across all architectures may benefit certain models but harm the performance of others, and this aspect should be considered. Therefore, more justification should be issued to prove that other baselines do not work at all to support more concretely the claim of a performance gain.\n- From the visualization, it appears that there are visible artifacts aligned with boundaries. These artifacts may be introduced by including $(dx_i, dy_i)$ in the node embedding. This raises questions about the necessity of incorporating $(dx_i, dy_i)$, as the Transform already appears to serve in learning a representation of the boundary shape."

It appears to be more like an offset w.r.t the closest point on the boundary. If there are multiple closest points, how is the choice made?"

                "value": "The existing models for operator learning have struggled to handle complex domains and boundary conditions effectively. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the Boundary-Embedded Neural Operators (BENO) model. BENO focuses on elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) and employs separate graph neural networks for learning the source term inside the domain and the boundary values at the boundaries. It leverages message passing and transformers to learn the solution operator. Experimental results demonstrate that BENO offers more accurate predictions for areas with diverse boundaries compared to existing models.\n\n### Post-rebuttal\nI apologize for the delay in my response. Thank you for addressing most of my inquiries and concerns despite the limited time. I appreciate the swift inclusion of various experiments, which has alleviated my concerns. I hope that my questions and suggestions contribute to making the paper even better.\n\nHowever, I still have reservations about the generalization of this method. As observed in the current experiments, the domain handled is limited to rectangles with cut corners. I remain skeptical about its applicability to smoother circles or more complex domains, as I originally inquired. Instead of conducting experiments on similar domains, it would be beneficial to showcase its performance on entirely different shapes and more intricate domains. Although the authors mentioned this as future work in their response, it seems that further exploration in this direction is warranted. \n\nTherefore, based on my personal opinion, I will revise my score to a maximum of 5 points. I greatly appreciate your kind and diligent responses to my review."

Many existing neural operator models often disregard PDEs and neglect boundary conditions when working with data.

Moreover, the idea of using triangulation to locally partition complex domains is a promising approach to tackling these challenges."

                "value": "However, the paper's focus on elliptic PDEs seems somewhat restrictive, especially considering that it primarily deals with the simplest case of the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This might give the impression that the novelty of the paper is somewhat limited.\n\nFor example, can the proposed BENO method be applied to Poisson equations with Neumann boundary conditions or mixed Robin boundary conditions? The current model design appears to be tailored to the Dirichlet boundary conditions, which might be considered quite restrictive. To truly highlight the advantages of this approach, it would be beneficial to demonstrate its applicability to a wider range of PDEs, including parametric PDEs such as convection-diffusion equations or nonlinear Burgers' equations. Moreover, exploring its applicability to time-dependent parabolic PDEs could lead to a more generalized operator learning model.\n\nIn this context, the paper experimentally investigates a single type of operator, the one between (f, g) and the solution u. However, it's intriguing to consider whether other types of solution operators could also be learned (for instance, as seen in the FNO paper with Darcy flow, where the coefficient could be an input to the operator, or the initial condition of PDE can be an input).\n\nFurthermore, the experiments in complex domains appear to be limited to similar, complex domains, such as the \"5 different corner elliptic dataset.\" It would be interesting to explore whether the BENO method can be extended and applied to different scenarios, such as domains with circular holes in the center of a square or corners at non-right angles (or more simple, circle domain as in (Lotzsch et al., 2022)). By conducting experiments in more diverse domains and presenting results in a variety of scenarios, the paper could better showcase the novelty and versatility of the BENO method.\n\nTherefore, it would be beneficial to generalize the limitations of BENO, as described in this paper. For instance, in terms of boundary conditions, there are relevant discussions in [1], and graph-based methods have addressed complex domains and a variety of equations and boundary conditions, as seen in [2] and [3], which leveraged Finite Element Method (FEM). Referencing these works might provide valuable insights.\n\nFurthermore, there is some curiosity regarding whether the results of the baseline methods were adequately compared. It appears from Appendix F that the internal and boundary grids for the baseline methods are distinguished using one-hot encoding. It's worth considering if this method provides the fairest basis for comparison. As mentioned in the paper, FNO suggests the use of Fourier continuation for different boundary conditions and domains ('Non-uniform and Non-periodic Geometry' part in [4]). Therefore, it raises the question of whether the paper's approach is indeed the best for addressing complex scenarios. Additionally, there is a model for operator learning called DeepONet [5], which can be applied directly to challenging boundary conditions and complex domains. It would be interesting to know whether the paper conducted a comparison with this model.\n\n*[1] Horie, M., & Mitsume, N. (2022).

What does the red part signify, and what about the orange part? How do they differ?\n\n* Regarding Table 1, as mentioned in the Strengths section, is it impossible for FNO to handle 5.? Is it also impossible for GKN to handle 5.? Is there no prior research in the field of operator learning models that can handle 5.?\n\n* In the Problem Setup (2. Problem Setup), it is not clear whether BENO can be applied to 3D or higher-dimensional domains. While the use of graph neural networks suggests that it might be possible, further explanation would be helpful.\n\n* In the context of 3.1 Motivation, where branch1 is interpreted as the interior and branch2 as the exterior from a Green function perspective, it's important to know whether the output of Branch1 precisely reaches 0 at the boundary and whether the output of Branch2 reaches exactly \"g\" at the boundary. Is this a process of approximating \"g,\" or is the model capable of obtaining the exact boundary values of \"g\"?\n\n* In Section 3.2, a more detailed explanation of the definition of $\\mathcal{E}_{kn}$ would be appreciated. Furthermore, the part around this section involving attributes is somewhat challenging to comprehend in written form. It might be a good idea to exclude this part if it ultimately relates to the explanation in Section 3.3.2.\n\n* Are dx, dy, and dc in Section 3.3.1 uniquely determined for each node? Also, why is dc necessary?\n\n* On page 5, is \"B\" ultimately equal to \"B^1\"? It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of where \"t\" changes and what its range is.\n\n* The definition of MAE for Table 2 is present in the appendix but not in the main text.\n\n* In Section 4.3.2, the explanation of training at 32x32 and testing at 64x64, is this capability attributed to BENO's use of graph neural networks, or are there other features enabling this super-resolution? A more detailed explanation would be appreciated.\n\n* In Appendix K, when looking at Figure 6, it appears that the results for \"Ours\" are different from other solution profiles, forming square blocks with discontinuities.
