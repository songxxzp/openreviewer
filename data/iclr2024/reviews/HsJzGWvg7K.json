Experiment results look promising, and paper writing is clear to follow (plus a lovely title :)\nIn more details:\n\n-\tSparse Cocktail differs from other sparse co-training approaches in that it can produce multiple sparse subnetworks across a spectrum of sparsity patterns and ratios simultaneously, while previous approaches only focus on one or two types of sparsity patterns and/or with different sparsity ratios. \n-\tThe approach alternates between various sparsity pattern training phases, incrementally raising the sparsity ratio across these phases. Underlying the multi-phase training is a unified mask generation process that allows seamless phase transitions without performance breakdown. \n-\tThe authors also complement a dense pivot co-training strategy augmented with dynamic distillation, aligning the optimization trajectories of diverse sparse subnetworks. In the end, all sparse subnetworks share weights from the dense network, culminating in a \"cocktail\" of dense and sparse models, offering a highly storage-efficient ensemble. \n-\tThe paper shows that Sparse Cocktail achieves great parameter efficiency and comparable Pareto-optimal trade-off individually achieved by other sparse co-training methods. Sparse Cocktail achieves comparable or even better performance compared to the state-of-the-art sparse co-training methods that only focus on one sparsity pattern per model. Additionally, Sparse Cocktail avoids the need for co-training multiple dense/sparse network pairs, making it a more storage-efficient ensemble."

The results are shown on different sparse subnetworks obtained from multiple sparse masks. However, it is likely that the performance of these sparse subnetworks is stable merely because of the relatively low sparsity reported in the paper. In order to see the effectiveness of the method, I would like to see the performance of the subnetworks with higher sparsity (> 90%) especially for unstuctured sparsity patterns.\n\n2. The algorithm is not entirely clear from the Figure and methodology section. For example, how many sparsities is each sparse pattern trained for, what are the performances of each sparsity pattern and how does a subnetwork\u2019s performance improve after merging (if it does).\n\n3. The author\u2019s don\u2019t comment on the loss landscape of each of the subnetworks obtained during training. From previous work by Paul et al [1] I would expect each of the obtained subnetworks to lie in the same loss basin. In order to assess the effectiveness of the dynamic distillation step I would expect to look at the Hessian or the linear mode connectivity between the subnetworks obtained.\n\n4. Additionally, the performance of the proposed method on ImageNet is poorer than AC/DC (in Table 1) which is a well established method. \n\nOverall my primary concern is that the novelty of this paper is limited as the authors have put together multiple existing methods (AST, AC/DC) in order to obtain multiple subnetworks at once. \nHowever, the attained subnetworks themselves have not been confirmed to be effective at higher sparsities.\n\n[1] Paul, Mansheej, et al. \"Unmasking the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: What's Encoded in a Winning Ticket's Mask?.\" International Conference on Learning Representations 2022."
