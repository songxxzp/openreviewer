So there is no loss of information.\nBut what if the filters are not orthogonal to each other? Assume a worst-case scenario where all filters are equal. In that case, the proposed ESR will give us a wrong sampling rate. So, is the proposed ESR intended to replace the regular \u201csampling rate,\u201d or is it intended as a heuristic to select cutoff frequency? If it is the second, then the paper should clarify it.\n2. Section 3.2, \u201cMetrics for three errors.\u201d \u2014 I think the middle one should be the definition of MErr.\n3. \u201caligning with the observations in Figure 1 that false responses and merging mistakes predominantly exist in areas with relatively low aliasing scores.\u201d \u2014 could you clarify how we are associating aliasing scores with a region of an image? \n4. \u201cHowever, for deeper features at the second and third stages, the aliasing ratio decreases.\nThis decrease does not signify a reduction in aliasing; rather, it occurs because the earlier high level of aliasing results in severe degradation. Consequently, the features become \u2018hard pixels,\u2019 meaning that the following stage struggles to extract useful information and loses response to objects.\u201d \u2014 How can we confirm that it is caused by the side effect of aliasing? Applying significant noise can generate an out-of-distribution (OOD) sample of the internal layers, which can also lead to poor feature extraction."
