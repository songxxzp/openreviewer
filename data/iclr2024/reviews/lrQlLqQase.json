                "value": "The review will be contained to this section owing to the flow in which it was conducted.\n\n### Abstract\n\n- I think you are being a bit unfair to the research community with your first sentence; there is plenty of work which considers causal reasoning in time, it is a basic tenet of causality (see Hume). Or I may have misunderstood the claim. Please explain or re-write.\n\n### Introduction\n\n- \"If cause event A had not occurred, effect event B would not have occurred\" this sentence does not make grammatical sense.\n- \"However, these approaches can have severe limitations, especially when applied to dynamical systems\" - what are these limitations? Pearl has multiple works on dynamical plans, clearly then it is feasible to use his SCM for studying dynamics, hence please be more precise with your critique or shortcomings of his and Spirtes' approach.\n- \"Interventions are often infeasible in physical systems\" - why is that? There are plenty of works to the contrary.\n- \"Moreover, these approaches ignore the dynamics as well as the possibility of other interventions between events\" - but there's plenty of work in this area, see e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08784.pdf\n- \"Further, these frameworks assume knowledge of causal dependencies or structural information between various events in the system\" but that is the core assumption of causal inference (notwithstanding causal discovery) that the causal diagram is known and usually that causal sufficiency holds at that. How can that be a critique of causal modelling in a paper about: causal modelling? Again, please elucidate on what you mean in this context.\n- Very interesting third paragraph re: Salmon's work.\n- I do not follow, are you suggesting that the example 'smoking causes lung cancer' is a poorly understood cause-effect relationship? Or are you suggesting that there are other causes which are not modelled by that same model?\n- This seems like a contradiction wouldn't you agree: \"real-world experiments conducted on simulated data\". \n\n### Basics and problem formulation\n\n- \"Any dynamical system can be described from the state viewpoint\" this is categorically not true using Kalman's definition, for chaotic dynamics.\n- Your first paragraph is essentially a re-statement of Pearl's SCM.\n- What is a \"filtered probability space\" with emphasis on _filtered_?\n- \"More formally, under sufficient smoothness conditions\" - and what are these conditions?\n-  Why would limits (1) and (2) exist? Where do they come from? What is the reasoning? What's the deduction of their existence?\n- Under process-based causality, I feel that several references are amiss. Yes those axioms (I and II) are mostly true (though (i) appears not to be within the space of quantum dynamics but let's not go there) but they would do well to be referenced. Hume argued the temporal priority principle a couple of hundred years ago, so this is nothing new and hence should be placed within the literature. Where does (iii) come from?\n- You haven't specified what 'HP' stands for so 'HP settings' makes no sense.\n- \"central idea behind Lewis definition\" who is Lewis here? What's the reference to?\n- \"causes, by themselves, increase the probability of their effects\" that is nonsensical; are you arguing that if a cause exists then the effect _may_ happen?\n- \"as the role of intervention is to mechanically separate the impact of a variable from the collective impact\" what does that mean?\n- Typo: 'stochiastic process'\n- What is a \"sticky value\"?\n\n### Formal establishment of causation\n\n- The grammar is getting noticeably worse as the paper is progressing. Consider proof-reading it a few times before next revision. \n- So far I do not following the reasoning in this section, specifically though why would this be true \"This could prove useful in the context of causal discovery.\"?\n- Typo: \"Equation equation 10 shows\"\n- \"Wrongly identifying correlations as causal links is a core problem in formal reasoning\" I would argue that it is a core problem in all of science. \n- I suggest you pick anything but 'g-formula' as 'g-formula' is already a popular approach for estimating treatment or exposure effects from longitudinal data that are subject to time-varying confounding. Which is not what you are doing here and so because that name is already reserved it may be wise to select something more distinctive.\n\n### Experiments\n\n- \"Modeling dynamical systems as SCMs is computationally and memory intensive to a prohibitive degree, especially in systems with numerous variables\" this is not true and plenty of work do precisely this, here is a good review paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06208.pdf\n- I do not understand what we are looking at in figure 1. There is almost no explanation for what the axis metrics are, what the frames are, why they are chosen and what they are meant to represent. What is blue? What is red? How are we meant to understand the horizontal row of subplots for $g$? How is any of this explainable? Certainly you say that we do not need system equations and graphs for this method, but I am struggling to understand how this is at all more useful?\n- Finally I do not agree with this statement at all \"Consequently, existing methods are irrelevant for baseline comparisons\" - if they are truly inadequate, as you claim, for dynamical settings then empirically show us why and show us how much better this theory is in comparison. Right now, unfortunately, we have to take you at face value that this statement is in fact true even though, in this review alone, multiple sources have been provided which point to the contrary. I do not think this is a fair evaluation of this work, let alone other models of causation.\n- The captions for all the figures in this section are much much too short to describe the amount of detail that is happening not just in the whole figure but all the panels included therein. Regrettably the main text does a fairly poor job of providing the missing explanation as we ll."

A central idea is the one of grit: If A is the cause of B, the corresponding grit (minimum probability of occurrence of B under all possible policies) should increase. Based on this intuition, the paper provides a rigorous definition of the cause of a given event, as well as the computational tools to verify this. Finally, the benefits of the proposed framework are shown in two experiments."

I do not think that these approaches build upon a dynamic setting, but I still think that the paper would benefit from a section that relates these approaches.\n- Definition of cause/grit. I am wondering whether an event $A$ could be a cause of an event $B$ even though the expected grit of $B$ does not increase from before to after $A$. Imagine a medical setting, where a doctor prescribes treatment (event $A$), that only works in combination with another treatment (event $C$) to cure the patient (event ($B$). ($A$ -> $C$ -> $B$). Then $C$ would be a cause but $A$ would not be a cause because the grit would not increase from before to after $A$ (since the grit is the minimum probability of $B$ over all possible policies, also the one that does not administer $C$). However, intuitively both $A$ and $C$ should be causes. \n- No code is provided (this is minor as the contributions of the paper are mostly theoretical)"

The extension to MDPs takes the min over all actions that lead to the event. Given this notion of causality, they show that the key quantities, grit (the minimum probability that an event occurs from a given state), and reachability (the analogous maximum probability), can be computed by solving an appropriately designed reinforcement learning problem. This makes the framework generically applicable which they demonstrate with experiments from Atari's Pong (with pixel-level observations), and a diabetes simulation."
