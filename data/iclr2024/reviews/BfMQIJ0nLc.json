            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I have several major concerns about dataset collection and evaluation strategies.\n\n> **Dataset Collection and Quality**\n\nAs the major contribution of this paper is the new VQA benchmark, I find the paper did a **poor job in explaining how the samples are generated, collected, and verified**. For example, how did you select images from existing sources? How did the annotator come up with QA pairs based on the images? How did you verify the correctness/relevance of these samples? From the current paper it is really hard to gauge the data quality of the benchmark.\n\nAfter I downloaded the public dev set, I can easily find a lot of VQA samples across categories that can be **solved without looking at the images**. Here are some examples:\u2028\u2028\n\n>**Example 1**\n\nImage: a photo of an African elephant. \n\nQuestion: The African elephant is the () land animal in the world. \n\nOptions: (A) smallest, (B) largest. \n\nCategory: attribute_recognition.\n\n> **Example 2**\n\nImage: a photo of a snow rabbit. \n\nQuestion: Which animal\u2019s skin is also adapted for survival in cold places? \n\nOptions: (A) fantastic leaf-tailed gecko, (B) polar bear. \n\nCategory: physical_property_reasoning.\u2028\u2028\n\n> **Example 3**\n\nImage: a photo of the world map centered on Australia.\n\nQuestion: What direction is Indonesia in Australia?\n\nOptions: (A) northwest, (B) northeast, (C) southwest, (D) southeast.\n\nCategory: spatial_relationship\n\nEven though I cannot attach images to my review, it is clear that these questions can be answered by a human without looking at the images. This makes MMBench more like a QA instead of a VQA benchmark. The authors should discuss how MMBench is collected and why such problematic samples can leak into your dev set. Did you use crowd-sourced or expert annotators? This is an important question to answer especially if MMBench continues to expand -- how do you plan to ensure the quality of collected samples?\n\nFinally, the paper did not discuss the **licensing for collected Internet images**. I also find some images of MMBench containing **watermarks** from existing website such as zhihu.com.\n\n> **Evaluation Strategy**\n\nI am also concerned with the CircularEval strategy. In section 3.1, the paper says *\u201cCircularEval doesn\u2019t necessarily require N x inference cost\u201d* because if the VLM makes a wrong prediction in one pass, the following passes can be dropped. As such, the paper claims this strategy has *\u201can affordable cost\u201c* (Section 3). I find this to be a very misleading statement because the computation cost is indeed O(N) and a \u201cperfect\u201d model will still require N passes. \n\nCould you explain why not doing N passes then report the average accuracy? \n\nHuman performance on MMBench is currently missing. This is important to gauge the overall difficulty of this benchmark.\n\nFinally, answer extraction using LLMs is a standard practice in NLP [1], and thus it is hardly a novel contribution.\n\n> **References**\n\n[1] Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners.

The results are usually \u201cwinner takes all\u201d. As shown in the results in Tab-3, more powerful models are usually stronger in every evaluation dimension. It would be interesting to see more fine-grained analysis, e.g. some models are stronger in dimension A, while another is stronger in dimension B, etc.\n3. Bias analysis. Shortcut/bias has long been a problem in VQA, where language bias and visual context bias are entangled with each other, leading the models to take shortcuts to answer the questions without real understanding. Does this benchmark suffer from similar problems?
