The proposed LayerAct functions aim to provide layer-level activation, reducing noise fluctuations in activation outputs and achieving noise-robustness independently of the activation's saturation state. The authors present a comprehensive analysis and experimental results demonstrating the superiority of LayerAct functions over element-level activation functions in terms of noise-robustness. Additionally, they show that LayerAct functions perform exceptionally well in handling noisy datasets, outperforming element-level activation functions, while also achieving superior performance on clean datasets in most cases."

I'd like to know if the proposed method has the potential to be adapted to these advanced network structures.\n\n- I still don't quite understand the advantage of \"layer-direction\" activation over \"element-wise\" activation. Could the author please provide a concise explanation with simple examples or a summary?\n\n- Additionally, I'd be interested in understanding in which applications LayerAct might excel or not excel. For example, we have instance norm for tasks like style transfer, batch norm for CNN-based classification tasks, and layer norm for transformer-related tasks. Can LayerAct be analyzed and discussed in a similar manner, suggesting suitable application areas?\n\n- The author needs to clarify the above questions. If these issues are addressed, I will consider these clarifications along with feedback from other reviewers in deciding whether to raise my score.\n\n[1] Instance Enhancement Batch Normalization: An Adaptive Regulator of Batch Noise, AAAI\n\n[2] Differentiable Learning-to-Normalize via Switchable Normalization, ICLR"

                "value": "1. I think the technical contribution is overall low. The proposed LayerAct can be viewed as Layer Normalization combining the (general) sigmoid-linear-units. Both of them are good methods in improving the performance of neural network. It is not surprise the proposed method can improve the performance over the original activation functions. It is good that this paper addresses the robust of the proposed method, however I have concerns in the second point. \n\n2. I have concerns on the clarity of why LayerAct is noise-robust. The main claim is that the scale activation function is bounded (Eqn.8 and Eqn.9), thus the model is robust. But, bounding the activation function cannot bounding the $y_i$, which can still be not robust. This paper should well address this point. It is true the proposed LayerAct can obtain good empirical results on corruption datasets. However, this is not surprising, because the previous methods[1] have show that the combination of Batch-Free normalization (e.g., LayerNorm) and BatchNorm can be more robust for distribution shift (e.g., corruption). The main insights is that LayerNorm can alleviate the train-inference inconsistency problem of BatchNorm (I noted all experiments on noise-robust uses the networks with BatchNorm). I want to ask whether the proposed LayerAct can be noise-robust on the network without BatchNorm?\n\n3. I have concern on the title of this paper. The title addresses \u201cADVANCING CNNS WITH BATCHNORM THROUGH LAYER-DIRECTION NORMALIZATION\u201d. However, I find the description of the proposed LayerAct is independent to the BatchNorm (e.g, this paper doesnot say how LayerAct alleviates the problem of CNN with BatchNorm). I think this paper should well clarify it\n\n4. This paper has some imprecise descriptions:  \n(1)I have concerns on this \u201cSpecifically, we propose a novel layer-level activation (LayerAct) mechanism, along with two as sociated functions. This advancement combines batch-direction normalization with the effects of layer-direction normalization\u201d. How does LayerAct combines both? If yes, why the experiments run on the network with BatchNorm? How does the LayerAct works on the network without BatchNorm.  \n(2) This paper claims \u201cOne-sided saturation avoids the vanishing gradient problem while maintaining noise-robustness\u201d. Why the One-sided saturation avoids the vanishing gradient problem? Based on my understanding, the saturation state will cause no gradient.   \n(3)why \u201d the sum of activation scale $\\|s(n^{LN})\\|$ will be similar across all samples\u201d?  please clarify it in detail. \n\n\nOther minors:  \n\u201cpay cloase attention\u201d in page 1. \n\n \n**Ref:**  \n[1] Delving into the Estimation Shift of Batch Normalization in a Network.
