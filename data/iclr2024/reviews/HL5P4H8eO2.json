The main idea is to use differential policy optimization to find efficiently a sequence of actions for a fixed starting state, given current estimates of the parameters that parameterize the observation-to-state encoder and the reward function and system dynamics in learned state space. The policy gradient is used to improve the estimates of the parameters, and because the computation of the action sequence is differentiable with respect to the parameters, the policy gradient ends up being differentiable with respect to the parameters, too."

Another major strength, shared with the TD-MPC algorithm on which DiffTOP is based, is that model learning does not have to be done ahead of time, thus alleviating the model mismatch problem that is central to model-based reinforcement learning. A third strength of the paper is the very solid empirical verification of the approach on many control problems, both in the reinforcement and imitation learning setting."

In MBRL, the latent-space encoder, latent-space dynamics, and the reward function parameters are learned within DiffTOP. In IL, the output of DiffTOP is forced to match the provided actions and DiffTOP carries out efficient inverse RL. The authors show that the proposed policy class outperforms baselines such as diffusion policies and IBCs."

If the cost and dynamics was learned to formulate a convex trajectory optimization problem, this would not be a problem as the encoder is forced to learn a representation of that form. However the authors propose to use a fully nonlinear formulation and it's not clear how the training pipeline would be robust against finding bad local minima.\n\n2. The contribution in the IL seems a bit weaker compared to MBRL. In the setting of imitation learning, it seems that the authors are performing a version of inverse RL (which similarly does not assume access to rewards, but learns rewards and dynamics from demonstrations). Making connections to previous methods within inverse RL would be good.\n\n3. \"For DiffTOP, we always use a base policy to generate the action initialization for the trajectory optimization problem\" - this makes the comparison between other methods a bit unclear as other methods did not start with an informed initial guess. The experiment results make it seem like DiffTOP cannot be used as a standalone tool for IL, but rather a tool for the purposes of refinement; yet the method section is proposing a standalone IL algorithm."

                "value": "1. The introduction of CVAE to generate multimodal samples is reasonable, but there are many other routes that might potentially handle the multimodality problem. For instance, it seems cheaper and more efficient to consider a differentiable stochastic trajectory optimization framework where a small amount of noise can be added to the action at every step, which forces trajectory optimization itself to be a stochastic procedure that will generate multimodal actions. Have the authors considered this formulation?\n\n2. CVAEs tend to be harder to train compared to recent diffusion-based generative models. Is it possible to train a diffusion model instead of address the multimodality problem? Maybe it is difficult since the author's framework requires latent states?\n\n3. How does DiffTOP perform without informed initial guesses in the RoboMimic experiment?"

For example, the algorithm is still very unclear to me, which model parameters exist and are optimized together. It would be great if the authors could introduce their algorithm more slowly and rely on less knowledge from the TD-MPC paper. While mentioning the relation to TD-MPC is important, requiring excellent knowledge of TD-MPC to read the paper is very limiting.\n\nI am a bit torn on whether to score marginally above or below the acceptance threshold.

Learning the dynamics and reward model is a supervised learning problem while learning the q-function is not. Therefore, I would expect that the supervised learning problem is much easier and imagine that the additional information flowing through this additional PG loss is not that important. What is the intuition of the authors for the additional PG loss? For imitation learning, the motivation for the additional bc loss is much clearer."
