                "value": "The paper proposes a method to alleviate accuracy drops observed upon (structured) pruning a (complex multi-branched) network without finetuning / retraining. The main idea is a sample efficient way to reduce perturbations of intermediate layers before pruning via jointly minimizing the reconstruction errors of intermediate outputs and increasing regularization iteratively for channels that are to be pruned.  This ensures that representational capability of the channels to be pruned are not significantly hampered by transferring them to other unpruned channels during the reconstruction process.\n\nWhile not being completely sample-free, the method demonstrates superior performance to other weight reconstruction / calibration methods. Thus this work makes progress towards suggesting that complete finetuning may not be required at all in structured pruning pipelines if reconstruction based methodologies are able to recover the lost accuracies.\n\nThe idea of transferring representational capacity via increasing regularization is not entirely novel [a]. Nor is the idea of reducing the reconstruction errors of intermediate outputs [b, c, d]. However, their combination is quite interesting here.\n\n[a] Neural pruning via growing regularizaiton.

The method accomplishes this by adopting a 2 phase reconstruction strategy where the first step attempts to separate filters into 2 non-overlapping sets where 1 set contains the consolidated information of the original group of filters, with a large weight normalization, and another set that contains very little residual information, with a small weight normalization. After this decomposition a relatively straightforward second step prunes the newly formed filters with low weight normalization. The authors approach is predicated on the use of a small calibration dataset to perform the weight reconstruction during the first phase and another update during the pruning phase. The results provided demonstrate that the approach yields much better results compared to other competitive methods that are unable to scale favorably to large networks on large datasets. The results show much better performance on CIFAR10/100 and Imagenet datasets, in terms of model accuracy, while maintaining a structured pattern that may yield better performance compared to unstructured methods."

                "value": "Major:\n- While the connection between the input to equation (2) is the parameter set w the definition only uses the layer weights W and the accompanying activations X. Also the the indexing over i is described in the text but requires a bit of rereading for the reader to grasp what the authors are trying to convey with the equation. Overall the readability suffers and I would appreciate a bit more attention to the connectedness of the variables.\n- Connected to equation (2), the authors mention \"naive optimizing...induces imbalanced parameter updates...earlier layers being over-optimized\". I'm not sure I understand what imbalanced updates and over-optimization actually mean. Empirically the authors attempt to support this statement using Figure 6 to illustrate that earlier layers are updated more aggressively than later layers so the proposed update attempts to smooth out these updates. When earlier layers are optimized too much does this negatively impact the reconstruction loss in equation (2) because the pruned output activations are not and should not be closely correlated with the unpruned activations?\n- Similar notational issues exist in equation (4) as mentioned in equation (2).\n- \"...to mitigate the side effect of the sparse penalty...\" this sentence could use more explanation to ensure the reader understands what the authors are referring to as the side effect of the penalty.\n- Algorithm 1 needs to be updating to fix issues with the definition with respect to the defined inputs. Although the pretrained model is defined as an input it isn't used anywhere in the actual definition.\n- Table 2 in section 4.2 seems to be missing some information to delineate the first set of columns denoting the top-1, RP, and RF metrics from the second set.\n- PSP yields similar results to AdaPrune in terms of RP and RF factors in Table 2 but with much better accuracy. I think a natural question would be the effectiveness of the structural pruning compared to the application of the calibration updating steps. It's possible the increased accuracy is due to the post pruning calibration steps, do any of the other non-training methods perform any post pruning calibration steps?\n- In Figure 5 the results for ResNet18 on CIFAR100 seem to be particularly bad for \"w/o REC\" compared to the other graphs even for a small number of pruned parameters. Is there a reason for this sharp drop-off?\n\nMinor:\n- The writing and presentation of the formulas during the main text could use more polishing before publication.\n- Stylistically the font using for equation (1) and (2) is not consistent with the font used for W and X in the main text."
