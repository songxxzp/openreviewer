                "value": "This paper focuses on the generalization performance of Transformers across various levels of task complexity. The paper introduces a new synthetic task, C-PVR (conditional point-value retrieval) to evaluate this generalization capability. In C-PVR, the model is asked to find a value at a specific position indicated by a pointer. In contrast to the PVR task (Zhang et al., 2021), C-PVR requires the model to navigate through multiple pointers until it reaches the desired position. The authors define the task's complexity in C-PVR by quantifying the number of hops to find the target value. Based on this task, the authors observe that modularity and adaptivity across tasks of varying complexity are significant to achieve better generalization. To address this, they propose Hyper-UT, a model equipped with Hyper-Modules that contains both modularity and adaptivity.\nIn the experiments, the authors demonstrate that Hyper-UT exhibits better generalization performance and efficiency when compared to conventional Transformers. Additionally, it performs competitively on ImageNet-1k, a well-known System-1 task. Furthermore, they analyze the generalization performance of pre-trained language models like T5 on C-PVR and observe that the scratch-pad can enhance the chain-of-thought ability of these models."
