                "value": "This paper addresses the problem of learning a model from a dataset partitioned into non-overlapping 'bags' of equal size, given the average value of the response variable in each bag. The difference with respect to usual regression analysis is that the individual responses are not provided, and so we cannot calculate the usual loss function. This calls for the definition of a modified loss function that depends only on the aggregate response in each bag.\n\nThe present paper analyses two such modified loss functions : L_bag, which measures the distance between the aggregate responses and the aggregates of model predictions ; and L_ins, which measures the distance between the aggregate responses and the individual model predictions.\n\nWhile L_bag gives rise to an unbiased estimator, the estimator corresponding to L_ins has a lower variance, at the cost of introducing a bias. The author(s) interpret the difference L_ins - L_bag as a sort of regularization term.\n\nThe paper also studies a loss function L_int, depending on a parameter rho, that interpolates linearly between L_bag and L_ins. (This corresponds to tuning the strength of the regularization.) The choice of rho involves a trade-off between the bias and variance of the resulting estimator, and one can make this choice in order to minimize the 'prediction risk' of the estimator.\n\nThe paper illustrates the above ideas in the case of linear models, with a quadratic loss function. In a rather specific asymptotic regime, with the training data drawn from standard normal distributions and then assigned uniformly at random to the bags, the paper computes several quantities of interest, such as the bias and variance of the estimator corresponding to L_int (and, by specialization, of that corresponding to L_bag and L_int). The results support the qualitative conclusions mentioned above.\n\nThe paper also contains certain numerical experiments, verifying the theoretical results in the asymptotic regime mentioned above, and exploring in the case of the Boston Housing dataset the optimal value of rho as a function of bag size.\n\nFinally, the paper also shows that truncating and adding a Laplace noise to the original aggregate responses makes the dataset epsilon-label Differentially Private. The resulting estimator is also Differentially Private, and the paper studies the optimal bag size (in the aforementioned asymptotic regime) as a function of the optimal regularization parameter rho."

The submission, is as a result, largely self contained and has no technical gaps.\n     4. The literature review is thorough and the authors have gone the extra mile organizing the ideas and summarizing the current state of a rapidly evolving niche in ML research.\n\nB. Significance, Quality\n     1. The subject is topical since Privacy preserving ML is a burning issue and an active area of current research.\n     2. The results shed new light on the interplay between instance-level and bag-level loss. It is interesting to see that the interpolate improves generalization in a real world dataset. \n     3. The qualitative conclusions derived in the asymptotic regime are clarifying and may be useful in more \"hairy\" real world datasets.\n\nC. Originality\n     1. Mixed loss function: The idea of interpolating between the loss functions is interesting and the idea that this could result in better generalization for aggregates-based learning appears to be novel.\n     2. The authors go beyond showing empirical results and derive closed form expressions and provide compelling interpretations for them."

                "value": "1. This is a minor comment on terminology: regularizers in the ML context, to the best of this reviewer's knowledge, only depend on model parameters and not on the data (which includes the feature vectors). Shrinkage and variance-reduction are related but not identical, and regularization in ML refers to the former. If indeed this term is used more broadly it may be helpful to include a few clarifying sentences and/or references. \n\n2. The theoretical results are proved under the following\n      a. Random Bags\n      b. Equal Sized Bags\n      c. Non-Overlapping Bags\n\nThe introduction cites the Google(Privacy Sandbox) and Apple(SKAd) APIs as motivations for the problem but the assumptions (a),(b),(c) do not hold in this regimes. In fact, a critical feature of both (a) Google's Private Aggregation API and (b) Apple's SKAd Network is that the aggregation keys are configurable (eg. aggregate behavior of traffic from California, visiting sports content at a certain time of day) ie the bags are specified by the consumer of the API, not by random aggregations. This enables ML algorithms to effectively use these aggregates for prediction.\n\nThis is an essential part of the problem. For example, here is a quasi-technical [report published by Google](https://github.com/google/ads-privacy/blob/master/Combining%20the%20Event%20and%20Aggregate%20Summary%20Reports%20from%20the%20Privacy%20Sandbox%20Attribution%20Reporting%20API.pdf)\n\nIf there is indeed a connection/insight in the paper that this reviewer has missed, please respond to the question below."
