To understand these algorithms more deeply, there's a need to broaden the scope of noise-enabled SGD within the Basin Hopping framework. A central understanding is that during neural network training, the trajectory of optimization can be intricate, requiring a more comprehensive perspective than merely focusing on the converged or lowest-loss states.\n\nThe study introduces several novel algorithms, utilizing synthetic landscapes to rigorously evaluate the stationary distributions of various optimizers. Crucial findings reveal relationships between training loss, hold-out accuracy, and the performance of different optimizers, with some algorithms even matching the efficiency of flat-minima optimizers with half the gradient evaluations."

Then it can test whether the two groups come from the same population using various statistics such as t-test.  Besides this, it also comes up with a few new algorithms based on the Basin Hopping framework, and compare their performance with SGD, noise injected SGD (either through model or gradients), and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) on synthetic and real-world datasets."

Noise-in-model Metropolis Basin Hopping\n\nThese methods are each summarised before (and after) the benchmarks are described. Three synthetic objectives are considered: (I) Himmelblau, (II) Three Hump Camel, and (III) Six Hump Camel. Performance on these objectives is judged in terms of the stationary distribution: terminal values of the optimisation algorithms are binned into each region of the landscape. Noise-in-gradient gradient descent and SAM are observed to skew solutions towards flatter minima (as expected). All algorithms exhibit a lot of noise in the six hump camel example. Next, generalisation performance is examined for four real-world problems: CIFAR10, CIFAR100 (image datasets), and GoEmotion, TweetEval (NLP datasets). Mann-Whitney U tests are performed to test whether significant differences can be detected between generalisation and optimization metrics (they cannot). Median accuracies and standard deviations are reported across each dataset with each optimiser. Hypothesis tests are also performed to compare algorithms to each other to see if significant differences in accuracies can be detected (they cannot). Finally, learning curves are displayed, highlighting that SAM requires double the gradient evaluations per step."

Unless realisations are appropriately coupled together (i.e. common random numbers), I'm not sure this is a sensible conclusion. There is naturally a lot of variance in the optimisation procedure, but one optimiser may still perform consistently better than another, everything else equal. \n- Can you present the stationary distributions in terms of bar charts rather than as a table? It's really difficult to read as is.\n- How long is each optimisation algorithm run for? \n- Wouldn't correlation tests be a better idea to test for generalisation vs optimisation section?
