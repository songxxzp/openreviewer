The proposed PDF decouples the time series into distinct short-term and long-term series based on its periodicity. Following this, the dual variations modeling block (DVMB) is employed to extract both short-term and long-term variations. Finally, the variations aggregation block (VAB) aggregates the extracted variations for final predictions. Experimental results show that PDF achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational cost."
