Previous works model anomaly detection according to the familiarity hypothesis in which the absence of training features indicates anomalous input. The manuscript extends this line of work by complementing familiarity-based AD with novelty-based AD. Features are novel if they are unexplainable according to the observed data. In practice, explainability is captured by previously introduced B-cos networks, while familiarity is modelled using a memory bank of training features.\nThe resulting hybrid formulation yields fewer false-positive responses in different relevant experimental setups.\n\nThe manuscript claims the following contributions:\n\nC1.  Formal definition of familiar and novel features in the context of anomaly detection. \n\nC2. A hybrid model for AD that accounts for the lack of familiarity and\nthe presence of novelty in an input sample.\n\nC3. Strong experimental results with reduced incidence of false positive responses."

It would be better to randomly sample points to give a more unbiased picture of the effect of the novelty score. \n\nSection 5.2 is not well argued as it is not clear that this methodology has reduced the role of the background class, as there are no experiments that measure performance with and without training with the background class.

The familiarity branch detects anomalies by comparing test samples features with normal samples features, while the novelty branch relies on anomalies with different explanations with normal. I feel this is just transfer from the feature space to the B-cos network\u2019s explanations. \n\n2. Bad academic terminology: \u201cthe complementary set is the background B\u2026\u201d, it\u2019s weird to call anomalies as background set. In the defect detection (or sensory anomalies in paper), background generally refers to normal regions. Even for semantic anomaly, it\u2019s also weird to call anomalies as background. The description of familiar and novel features is also hard to follow.\n\n3. Evaluation on sensory anomaly dataset is not enough, only MVTec. Moreover, your method performs poorly on sensory anomalies and cannot compared with the anomaly localization methods. So, just focus on the semantic anomaly, your method visual inspectable explanations are not very valuable."

Moreover, anomaly appearances are usually different from normal, although the network don\u2019t generate representations in the familiar space, the network will generate representations that are different from normal. So, anomalies can also be determined through familiarity branch.\n\n2. Thus, I think you should demonstrate that kind of anomalies will be determined as false negatives by the familiarity branch, and the novelty branch can solve this. Although Figure 6 shows that the novelty branch can reduce false negative rate, this figure is likely unfair, as we don\u2019t know what the familiarity-based method specifically refers to. It needs to your familiarity branch to be fair.\n\n3. Figure 5 still cannot explain the effectiveness of your method. Adding novelty only increases the distance of anomalies that could be classified in the first figure, but the confusion regions in the first image still exists in the third figure."
