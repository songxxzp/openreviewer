The technical quality of the submission is high, the problem is of interest, and the benchmarking results demonstrate that existing methods struggle to solve the benchmark. I do have several suggestions for improvement which I hope the authors take. \n\n######## Arguments ########\n\nThe main technical contribution of the paper is the problem formulation of meta-referential games and a synthetic benchmark that studies the setting. The idea is that, given a sufficient number of systematic generalization training problems, the listener/speaker agents should be able to learn a compositional learning behavior, such that they can generalize compositionally _in a new systematic generalization problem_. One additional technical contribution is the SCS, which is a domain-agnostic representation of a symbolic space. Unlike one-hot encodings, whose size depends on the number of values that each dimension can take, the SCS has a fixed size given a chosen dimensionality. For the benchmark, this implies that the different \"tasks\" can use varying semantic structures and the agents should still be able to meta-learn a compositional behavior.\n\nI also appreciate the discussion of systematicity and disentanglement, though I have some comments/questions about that. \n\nI have a few suggestions for improvement, which I think are necessary in order for the paper to be a complete technical contribution, which I summarize below:\n\n- Details of the SCS\n    - It's unclear what the tuple (d(i))_i... means. The authors then say that the \"shape of a stimulus ... is a vector over [-1,+1]^N_dim\". Is the shape a vector or is the representation a vector? If the vector is over [-1,+1] on every input, where does the d(i) the tuples factor in? The authors themselves state that the shape doesn't depend on the d(i)'s. \n    - The later description says l(i) \\in [1; d(i)] -- what does [1; d(i)] mean? is it the same as [1, dim(i)]? It seems that the authors might be using the two notations interchangeably\n    - My understanding is that for every dimension i, l(i) picks an \"index\" from 1 to d(i), which is precisely the value of the stimulus at dimension i. Then, a Gaussian is sampled around that index with a small enough variance such that all samples fall near l(i) and are not confused with l(i)-1 or l(i)+1. If this is the case (which I think Fig. 3 confirms), the authors should attempt to make their textual description a bit clearer. As it stands, it is a bit convoluted. \n    - The authors should carefully incorporate the answers to these questions and a cleaner explanation of the SCS in text.\n- Evaluation protocol of the meta-RGs\n    - My understanding of the first few lines is that generating \"differently semantically structured\" spaces is akin to generating many SCAN datasets. So each generated space is 1 SCAN dataset, and our goal will be to meta-learn a strategy that enables solving the ZSCT of a new SCAN dataset?\n    - \"a meta-referential game is composed of two phases\" -- I'm confused by this. Isn't each RG itself composed of two phases, and the meta-RG a wrapping process that presents the two agents with many such RGs?\n    - The authors put considerable efforts toward explaining the overall evaluation/training process, but it still doesn't appear to come through clearly. There are RGs and meta-RGs, shots and episodes. Each shot is a series of RGs. It is unclear exactly how all these pieces interact. I think the manuscript would leverage from one algorithm block that summarizes the overall process. For example:\n```\nAlgo: Meta-RG evaluation process\n\n    Meta-training phase:\n    for episode in NumberOfEpsiodes // loop over tasks=episodes\n        draw semantic structure\n        for shot in NumberOfShots   // loop over ...\n            draw component values\n            for RG in ...\n                draw stimulus\n                ...\n    Meta-testing phase:\n    freeze speaker\n    ...\n```\n    - The textual description is just too complex to come across clearly. Having an algorithmic description (and relying on it by referencing it in the textual description) might make things a lot clearer. \n    - But overall, my understanding is that the agent faces a set of meta-training settings, each of which fixes one symbolic space and consists of many training RGs and zero-shot RGs. Then the agent faces meta-testing RGs, which presumably have little data?"

            "questions": {
                "value": "######## Additional feedback ########\n\nThe following points are provided as feedback to hopefully help better shape the submitted manuscript, but did not impact my recommendation in a major way.\n\nIntro\n- I'm not really sure I follow how the authors' view of online/offline relates to the RL view\n\nSec 2\n- Fig. 1 -- why does the receiver also observe the state? Is it just a \"noisy\" version of the state w distractor stimuli?\n- My understanding: the sender receives 1 input and communicates (potentially back-and-forth) with the listener, who additionally receives a set of inputs (potentially including the speaker's input or the same \"object\"). The task is for the receiver to determine, given messages from the sender, whether any of its observed stimuli match the speaker's. Some of this isn't explicitly stated, so it required looking at the figure. If there is such a 1-sentence explanation, I encourage the authors to include it at the beginning of their explanation before diving into the specific properties/variations. \n- This section is a perhaps too philosophical discussion of the relations between disentanglement and compositionality, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing\n\nSec 3\n- Authors state that in step N+2 the listener observes the input of the listener \"rather than an object-centric samples with the same semantic meaning\" --- but according to the definition, it's not _always_ the same semantic meaning, right? The game is to determine precisely whether the meaning is the same?\n- \"we propose a rule-based speaker\" -- At this point, it seems that the only learning agent is the listener. But then (in Sec 4) the authors apparently clarify that this is only an ablative test to see how well the listener can learn CLBs given a fixed (linguistically compositional) speaker. This should be either omitted from this section or stated more clearly\n\nSec 3.2\n- Vocabulary permutation: I wonder if it would be possible to construct a different stimulus representation that _doesn't_ require permutation to guarantee no cheating. Any insight from the authors on this? (In an ideal world, we would get a proof that no such representation exists, but an intuitive description of why that's difficult would also be valuable.)\n\nSec 4\n- The authors report only results of the test/zero-shot performance. While this is the metric of interest, I wonder if it's possible, because of the difficulty of RL/MARL training, that even training performance is low? That would conflate the standard RL issues witht he issues of CLB.\n\nSec 4.1\n- How is EoA measured? What about topsim/posdis/bosdis? What values should we expect for them? Is higher or lower better?\n- Generally, I would expect a discussion that goes beyond just the zero-shot accuracy\n\nTypos/style/grammar\n- Fig. 1 (and others): authors should use a vector version of the image, not PNG or JPEG -- the size is small and zooming in blurs all letters/symbols\n- Sec 2, \"Compositionality...\" -- \"...the work ofHupkes et al. (2019)\" --> missing space\n- Sec 2, \"Compositionality...\" -- \"... related contents\"(Fodor et al., 1988).\" --> missing space\n- Sec 2, \"Compositionality...\" -- topographic similarity (topsim) vs. posdis (positional disentanglement) -- maintain consistency of abbreviations and parentheses\n- Sec 2, \"Compositionality...\" -- I was initially confused by \"and interchangeably compositional behaviors and systematicity...\" because I thought you would use either of those two interchangeably with \"linguistic compositionality\". It would be clearer to write \"and compositional behaviors and systematicity interchangeably to ...\"\n- Once the authors define the RG acronym, they should avoid going back and forth between RG and referential game\n- Sec 3 -- \"Figure 4(left)\" --> missing space\n- Sec 3.1 -- \"relies on gaussian kernels\" --> capitalize Gaussian (throughout the manuscript)\n- Sec 3.1 -- \"Figure 4(right)\" --> missing space\n- Sec 3.2 -- \"an meta-referential game\" --> \"a meta...\"\n- \"we bring the readers attention on\" --> \"we bring the reader's attention to\""

What does this specifically mean in the context of this paper? Would be great if the authors can give a clear definition of this property.\n\n\n   ii) Can the authors provide more insights and explanations about why SCS is a domain-agnostic representation?\n\n\n   ii) What is the architecture used for the Recall task experiment in appendix C.1? Is it possible that the performance gap is caused by the choice of implementation of the agents? My concern is whether the proposed SCS is universally more effective than OHE in terms of BP, regardless of the network architectures. Is there any theoretical evidence of this claim?\n\n  iv) How does the shape invariance property of the SCS representation translate into the meta-referential games?\n\n   v) The description of the meta-referential games is a bit abstract to me. It's also unclear to me how the compositionality is examined through the games. It would be great if the authors can provide an algorithm table to summarize the game procedure and show some game instances to facilitate understanding."
