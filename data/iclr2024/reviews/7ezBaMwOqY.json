                "value": "## Question of Novelty\nThe manuscript's primary shortcoming lies in its novelty. As mentioned earlier, the foundational concept was presented in 1987 [1], and an enabling step for translating the molecular design task to gradient-based optimization was introduced in [2]. Despite references to many SOMO methods favoring linear scalarization for multi-objectivity, I think the reason they chose linear scalization is that the their emphasis is on the algorithm development while an extension to MOMO is relatively trivial. It might be more apt to redirect this focus towards application.\n\n## Concerns over Linear Scalarization Critique\nThe authors critique linear scalarization methods, arguing that they can't comprehensively traverse the Pareto solution merely by weight adjustments, as depicted in Figure 3(b). Contrarily, based on my experience, linear scalarization can navigate along the Pareto front toward both extremes, and with weight tuning and keeping all points visited during the processes, results comparable to PCI's can be achieved. It would be beneficial for the authors to record all points traversed during optimization and employ hypervolume as a performance metric.\n\n## Generalizability of the Method\nDST represents only a handful of cases that render the molecular design problem differentiable, enabling the application of gradient-based methods. The value of PCI is limited if it can not be adapted for broader molecular design techniques.\n\n## Lack of thorough investigation\nThe authors recurrently state that MOMO's aim is to scrutinize the Pareto front, yet they predominantly highlight a single value representing an average of the top-100 molecules. A comparison of the Pareto fronts analyzed by PCI and LS would bolster their claims.\n\n## No open-sourced code is available"

                "value": "For molecular optimization in drug discovery, it is essential to simultaneously optimize multiple properties that may either contradict or correlate with each other, such as efficacy, potency, safety, bioavailability, and ease of synthesis. This paper proposes a framework called Preference-Conditioned Inversion (PCI) for multi-objective molecular optimization in such discrete spaces, given a set of m objective properties with specified preferences. Firstly, a surrogate function that provides m objective function values for a given molecular graph is learned using the differential scaffolding tree (Fu et al, 2022). Then, within the convex hull of the gradient vectors of the m objective characteristics, the direction that most aligns with the given preference vector and moves towards the Pareto optimal solution is determined by solving a linear programming problem updating the differential scaffolding tree. After several iterations of this update, the discrete scaffolding tree is sampled and assembled into molecules, updating molecule x. By repeatedly updating in this manner, a Pareto optimal solution that aligns with the preference in the discrete molecular graph space is generated. When enumerating Pareto optimal solutions, they can be efficiently generated by systematically changing the preference. In the paper, the effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by first performing a sanity check on a synthetic task and then comprehensively comparing it with many baselines in an actual molecular optimization task."

In discrete optimization like molecular optimization, which is the subject of this paper, it is known that the solutions generated by this Linear Scalarization fail to capture trade-offs and produce biased solutions. This point is also illustrated in Figure 1. On the other hand, evolutionary computation and multi-objective Bayesian optimization have issues in terms of computational efficiency and alignment with the given preference vector. The proposed method addresses the demonstrated shortcomings of these existing methods, providing an algorithm that efficiently searches for Pareto optimal solutions that align well with the given preferences, making it a practically valuable contribution.\n\nFirstly, the paper learns m objective characteristics using differentiable methods and then freezes them. The idea of leveraging their differentiability to compute multiple gradient vectors and explicitly optimizing their convex combination with linear programming, and then sampling the locally optimal solutions to return to discrete optimization is technically very intriguing. The experimental results, which include comparisons with many methods including Linear scalarization on actual multi-objective molecular optimization benchmarks, show good performance."

The procedure for the non-dominating descent direction by linear programming, which is the core of the proposed algorithm, Eq.(9), is designed based on the non-uniformity criterion, eq.(3). But this metric would not be assumed in Linear Scalarization. While it seems natural that the score for eq.(3) is better than LS if we assumed this scoring, the practical significance of this is unclear.\n\n2. Although this method is proposed as a framework, it heavily relies on the \"differentiable scaffolding tree\" method (Fu et al, 2022). It's unclear if this specific method is essential, or if other surrogate methods could also be suitable. Moreover, especially the procedure in the inversion step, \"sample the discrete scaffolding tree\", is not clearly described. A more detailed comparison with the experimental results of I-LS and PCI would be appreciated for readers to interpret the comparisons between I-LS and PCI.\n\n3. This study seems to specialize insights from established multi-objective optimization research, specifically De \u0301side \u0301ri et al (2012) and Mahapatra & Rajan (2020), to multi-objective optimization in the discrete space of molecular optimization.

It is unclear whether PCI will provide any clear advantage over other SOMO schemes applied to MOMO tasks via linear scalarization - *IF* one has a specific preference condition to impose on the multiple properties to be optimized.\nIn such a case, would there be any advantage for PCI compared to MOMO method via SOMO+scalarization?\n\n2. Similarly, if one has not a single but still a \"small\" number of preference conditions the optimized molecules need to meet, what would be the advantage of using PCI compared to repeating MOMO via SOMO+scalarization for each of the preferences?\n\n3. However, when one desires to explore the overall Pareto front for a variety of preferences, it seems that the proposed PCI scheme may begin to provide distinct advantages over MOMO via SOMO+scalarization, since the pre trained surrogate oracle can be put to good use for a large number of different preferences - despite the initial cost (e.g., in terms of oracle calls) of training the surrogate.\nIt would be very helpful if the authors could discuss when PCI would have clear advantages over other simple extensions of SOMO methods.\n\n4. In Fig. 1(b), it is not very intuitive why linear scalarization would result in the optimization trajectories shown in the figure.\nPlease provide a detailed explanation of the LS optimization scheme that is illustrated in Fig. 1(b) and provide some insights as to why the scheme would prefer Pareto optimal solutions located near the end of the allowable preference regions.\nThis also applies to the results shown in Fig. 3(b).\n\n5. I-LS is defined as a scheme that uses \"the same inversion framework as PCI but adopts linear scalarization\".\nThis is somewhat ambiguous, and it would be helpful if the authors could refer to the PCI diagram in Fig. 2 and clearly explain which part is changed and how.\n\n6. I-LS seems to perform surprisingly well in the evaluations (e.g., Table 1 and Table 2), where PCI doesn't necessarily outperform I-LS by a significant margin for all performance metrics.\nThis again raises questions about the fundamental advantages of PCI over simpler scalarization-based approaches (e.g., comments #1-#3 above)."
