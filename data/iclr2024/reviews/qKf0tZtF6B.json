The claim on the interpretability presented in the abstract is not substantiated later on in the empirical experiments or results. It is not clear how the framework is interpretable especially for a system with larger number of degrees of freedom. \n\nW3. The experiments performed are on very (very) simple systems such as a damped spring and damped pendulum. The community has moved forward from these experiments. Please see the experiments in the references mentioned against W1. Especially, the experiments on simple one-degree of freedom toy examples are not enough to show the applicability of the approach to any realistic problems. For this some demonstration on larger systems with more degrees of freedom (~50-100) should be conducted. Note that realistic systems can have much higher degrees of freedom.\n\nW4.

This allows meaningful interpretation of the error in the learned dynamics. \n\nQ2. It is not clear what the authors mean by the claim that the framework is interpretable. Do they mean that the dissipative and non-dissipative terms are learned separately? This is not necessarily interpretable. There are interesting works on interpretability.

GPs are known to have issues with larger input features. Can the present approach be extended to such realistic systems?\n\nQ4. It is not clear how the input features will be employed for the present approach in a multi-degree of freedom system. Specifically, whether the approach is permutation invariant or not is not clear. That is, does the order in which the degrees of freedom are provided as the input matter or not? Authors should clarify."

                "value": "This manuscript proposes a Gaussian process regression model that incorporates the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition and a method for eliminating indeterminacy by incorporating knowledge of symmetry into it as a constraint on the model. Compared to the baseline models, the proposed method has not only improved the predictive performance but also allows for the construction of interpretable models."

            "strengths": {
                "value": "The strength of this manuscript lies in the fact that the interpretability of the nonparametric model, Gaussian process regression, was ensured by basing it on the Helmholtz Hodge decomposition, and that compensation was made for the identifiability of the estimated model in order to achieve a physical valid interpretation."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "A weakness of this manuscript is the lack of discussion of interpretability in the demonstration experiments, despite the authors' claim that the proposed method has a high interpretability.\nIn addition, when the proposed method is applied to complex phenomena that often require interpretation, the symmetries of the system are often considered to be unknown, and in this case, it is considered to be difficult to achieve identifiability by the proposed method.\nThis point is also considered to pose difficulties in terms of improving the prediction performance by the proposed method."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "It would be better to add a demonstration for more complex systems with larger degrees of freedom.\nIt would be better to describe the concept of applying the proposed method to cases where the symmetry of the system is unknown."
