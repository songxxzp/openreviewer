                "value": "Summary: The paper addresses the challenge of Query-Policy Misalignment in Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL). PbRL is a method where reinforcement learning (RL) agents align their behavior based on human preferences. However, the efficiency of these models is often restricted due to costly human feedback. The paper identifies that most existing PbRL methods aim to improve the reward model's quality by selecting queries but may not necessarily enhance the RL agent's performance. The authors introduce the concept of policy-aligned query and hybrid experience replay as a solution. These methods focus on improving the alignment between the queries chosen and the current interests of the RL agent, thereby enhancing feedback efficiency. This is done by simply sampling from recent trajectories."

As the Authors state in the paper, their sampling strategies require minor additions to the existing models\u2019 code, on the order of a couple dozen lines of code, so their approach is easy to implement.\n\nThe proposed approach has been tested on a variety of control tasks where it shows improvement in performance compared to the baseline models.\n\nOverall, I think this submission is a solid work with a clear message and thoroughly conducted experiments."

                "value": "I wasn\u2019t able to fully follow some of the logic regarding the justification of the sampling scheme design. Throughout Pages 5 and 6, I understood the equations describing the error bounds for the Q-functions and the rewards but I couldn\u2019t see the formal connection between these bounds and the proposed sampling schemes. If there *is* a formal connection, I suggest elaborating on it, e.g. in the statement in 5.1. that goes: \u201cBy assigning more observers feedback <\u2026> we aim to enhance the accuracy of the preference (reward) predictor <\u2026> This aligns with the intuition from the condition <\u2026> in Eq. (5).\u201d Similarly, in 5.2, the claim: \u201cThe proposed mechanism can provide assurance that the Q-function is updated adequately near $d^\\pi$\u201d may need further elaboration formally supporting it. If there *isn\u2019t* a formal connection between these claims and Eq. (5), I suggest removing Eq. (5) and the related references as, in the current standing, they may be confusing to a reader like myself.\n\nAt the same time, similar ideas have been explored in literature. The field of decision-aware model learning (or value equivariance model learning) used the idea that, in model-based RL, learning a model that\u2019s accurate everywhere might be unnecessary and, instead, learning a model that\u2019s only accurate in task-critical regions of the state space may offer a way of improving models\u2019 sample complexity. Although these approaches, to my knowledge, have not been applied to RLHF, they pursued similar goals (i.e. improving the sample complexity) by using similar methods (i.e. focusing on the prediction accuracy for task-relevant states and transitions). I suggest discussing these (and similar) lines of work and their relation to the proposed sampling approach in the paper."
