Further, the authors introduce the first GNN implementation of the proposed framework \u2013 ISDEA as a double equivariant model, and DEq-InGram as a distributionally-double equivariant version of InGram. Experimentally, the authors devise a handful of new datasets and run experiments on relation prediction $(i, ?, k)$ and node prediction $(i, r, ?)$ tasks."

This is highly relevant for modern graph learning tasks, especially in low-data regimes without input node features.\n\n**S2.** The experimental agenda is convincing - a handful of newly proposed datasets with relation prediction and entity prediction tasks. Perhaps the experimental section could have been even stronger if the evaluation was performed on all nodes/relations in the inference graph instead of 50 random negatives, but the authors acknowledge it is the scalability issues of the ISDEA model (not the framework in general) that are likely to be addressed in the future work."

                "value": "The following ones are not the critical weaknesses but rather several discussion points I\u2019d invite the authors to elaborate on: \n\n**W1.** The formalization in Section 2 assumes the existence of bijections (nodes-to-nodes, relations-to-relations) in training and test graphs. Basically, the framework posits the double equivariance only when training and test graphs have exactly the same number of nodes and edge types - which practically does not happen very often. On the other hand, the constructed datasets PediaTypes and WikiTopics all have different numbers of nodes and relations at training and test time (so there is no bijection possible). Could you please comment on the seeming discrepancy between the theory and what is measured in the experiments? \n\n**W2.** Section 5.2: \u201c_relatively easier task of node prediction_\u201d - I do not quite agree with this statement. The results might suggest the task is easier simply because you take 50 random negatives among _thousands_ of nodes in the inference graph, so those negatives are likely to be _easy_ negatives. On the other hand, the number of relations in the datasets is 50-150 in PediaTypes and <50 in WikiTopics, so the negative relation samples are likely to be harder. It was found that evaluation on small number of negative entities overestimates the performance, so I would hypothesize the numbers (and task impression) would change when the architecture would scale to ranking all nodes in the inference graph."

                "value": "**Q1.** What are the input features to standard GNN architectures reported in the experiments under GraphConv / GAT / GIN? Initialization of nodes with all ones or with random vectors? \n\n**Q2.** Since DEq-InGram is distributionally double equivariant (by means of averaging several runs with different random relation vectors initializations), would averaging NBFNet results across several runs with random relation initialization count as distributionally double equivariant as well?\n\n**Q3.** The distributionally double equivariant idea posits equivariance in expectation, of which the easiest implementation is averaging over several runs (if we talk about drawing samples of relation vectors). Drawing parallels to group-equivariant CNNs, it is possible to achieve equivariance via augmentations such as frame averaging. I wonder if any such \u201caugmentation\u201d or frame averaging is possible within the double equivariance framework. If so, it might be a good idea to clearly state in the paper that distributionally-double equivariance is different from frame averaging"

How does the logical description given in the beginning of page 3 in any way correspond to this figure?\n  - Multigraph: Authors seem to suggest a multigraph is more general than a knowledge graph. It is unclear to me what authors specifically mean by this? If they mean a directed, multi-relational graph then this is nothing more than a knowledge graph. Heterogenous networks are special instances with single relation types allowed between nodes etc.\n  - Doubly inductive: The naming is somewhat problematic, because the inductive prediction is either on the relation or on one of the entities at a time, but not both according to Def 1. \n   - Isomorphic triplets: The definition of multigraph isomorphism and triplet isomorphism is a very odd one. I have no idea why, e.g., (Hans, Grand $\\land$ Father, Bob) in train and (Hanna, Granny $\\land$ Mother) should be considered isomorphic (and at this point we still do not know the role of logical conjunction in defining the relations). This is essential because everything builds on this notion of \"isomorphism\" which is completely unjustified.\n  - The paper is very hard to parse in general: in many cases, the statements of the results appear ambiguous to me, including the ones in the appendix.\n\n- **New architectures**: The new architectures introduced in the paper appear to be somewhat incremental. IDSEA is a variant of DSS-GNN operating on relation-induced subgraphs, whereas DEq-InGram is a simple modification of InGram with bagging.\n\n- **Empirical findings**: IDSEA seems to perform consistently worse than DEq-InGram in the task node prediction on PediaTypes, which does not seem to match what the theory suggests and is not being discussed in the paper. \n\n- **Train and test distribution**: The paper predominantly focuses on scenarios where the train and test graphs share a similar distribution. However, there exists a range of tasks involving unseen nodes and relations where the distribution significantly differs between the training and testing phases.  Further experimental validation on these tasks is required."
