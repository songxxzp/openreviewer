For example, the tuning of its hyperparameters could be another optimization problem or the uncertainty provided by the BNNs could be inaccurate. However, these problems are not discussed in the paper. Furthermore, I don't understand why the proposed method only requires the epistemic uncertainty. There are no motivation, explanation, or insights about this choice and why it work.\n- The proposed acquisition function of optimizing both the prediction and the uncertainty and the usage of NSGA-II to optimize this acquisition function seems to be not too novel for me. The idea is very similar to UCB. There are no deep analysis regarding this proposed acquisition function and why it will work well.\n- The experimental evaluation is very limited. It doesn't compare against other baselines in the main paper. In Section 5.1, it is not convincing to choose the surrogate model (inference method) by using only 1 synthetic experimental result. \n- Related works should mention other types of surrogate models apart from GP and BNN, such as TPE and RF.
