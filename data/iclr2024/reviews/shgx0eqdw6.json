It achieves this by employing a reward mechanism that guides the text-generation process of a language model. The method consists of reward-guided scoring and token selection. The goal is to generate text that is both coherent and contextually relevant while satisfying specific alignment criteria or objectives. The method improves the average reward compared to standard decoding and demonstrates better lexical diversity without compromising contextual consistency. The experiments validate the effectiveness of ARGS in aligning the generated text with human preference."

However, there are some limitations: (1) ARGS will certainly achieve higher scores since the RM is integrated during the decoding process. Essentially, applying any RM constraints during the decoding stage will result in higher scores when being evaluated by that RM. (2) The calibration of RM remains unclear -- does a higher reward score certainly lead to a better response, especially the reward score difference is less than 1? \n\nOverall, I think it not very fair if the authors use the same RM in their methods and evaluation."
