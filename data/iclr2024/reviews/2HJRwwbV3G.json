                "value": "This work revisits the hypothesis that knowledge in pre-trained transformers may be limited to a few neurons. They do this by running two different model editing methods to identify neurons that are responsible for specific syntactic phenomena using the BLIMP minimal pairs dataset. While they do find a small number of mostly local knowledge neurons responsible for syntax, they find that intervening on these neurons is not enough to change model predictions in a robust way.\n\nThe paper also borrows from past work on factual editing, and along with their own results, conclude that the knowledge neuron thesis is flawed because intervening on these neurons is not sufficient to reliably change model behavior. Thus, they call for a more \"holistic\" approach that studies not individual neurons but entire layer structures and attention mechanisms as the motif for interpretability."

It further extends knowledge to include syntactic or formal knowledge, and similarly finds small number of neurons that can be ablated to suppress their respective represented knowledge, particularly distributed throughout the later layers. However, through previous and additionally proposed metrics, in particular emphasizing bi-directionality and synonym-agnosticism, the authors argue that the discovered knowledge neurons cannot be considered to contain anything like \u201cknowledge\u201d, but simply conserve token correlations found in the training text."

Lastly, the experiments seem comprehensive, and convincingly demonstrates the authors\u2019 two main claims: the existence of syntax-knowledge neurons in LLMs analogous to fact-knowledge neurons, and that neither sets of knowledge neurons can be considered to robustly represent \u201cknowledge\u201d."

In particular, I feel that such detailed investigations of LLMs on a more \u201ccognitive\u201d level, i.e., assigning individual neurons to be representing concepts / knowledge wholesale, is orthogonal to dissecting the computational mechanisms of attention-based LLMs, and is more suitable for a conference like ACL. This is not really the fault of this particular paper, but the literature they attempt to address (which are predominantly published in ACL), though ironically, this paper raises exactly the point that such \u201cknowledge neuron\u201d search in LLMs may be ill-advised, given that these models are simply token sequence autocomplete machines. \n\nNevertheless, given its current scope and that we are explicitly asked to assess significance of contribution to the field (of machine learning), I recommend borderline rejection for ICLR (but would otherwise strongly recommend acceptance for, e.g., ACL!). But I would be willing to convinced that it\u2019s within scope if the AC and other reviewers disagree."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- one of my major concerns is the neuron selection procedure, which a priori limits the number of knowledge neurons to be 2-5. As I understand it, this procedure was not proposed by the authors, but in my opinion this process alone excludes the possibility of distributed representation, a much more reasonable null-hypothesis, resulting in a seemingly important discovery of knowledge neurons but in fact represents very little of the actual computations in the model. This is very reminiscent of the \u201cgrandmother\u201d or \u201cJennifer Aniston\u201d neuron type of work in neuroscience, and narrows the scope of the investigation arbitrarily and prematurely. Some investigation of distributed representation would, in my opinion, increase the impact and reach of this work\n\n- the paper seems to be \u201con the fence\u201d and sometimes explicitly contradicting itself. For example, page 7 states \u201cLMs process and express the two types of knowledge using the same mechanism.\u201d while the high-level conclusion of the paper, iiuc, is that there is no \u201cknowledge neurons\u201d. I think it would improve readability if the authors can find a more consistent messaging.\n\n- the paper references a small number of previous works heavily, and without prior knowledge in the field, it\u2019s hard for me to assess how much of the contributions are novel. The assessment of syntactic knowledge and newly proposed metrics are clearly new contributions, but a small \u201ccontributions\u201d section explicitly and concisely summarizing this would be helpful.\n\n- most of the illustrative examples (Figs 2-6) are on the case of determiner-noun, and some successful examples of the other two cases (subject-verb, gender and number agreement) would be even more convincing. Apologies if I had missed this in the supplemental.\n\n- Formal and functional competence are referenced in the paragraph after figure 1, but without definitions, which can be confusing for a naive reader. The definition in the later paragraph was very helpful, and may be better if moved to be earlier."
