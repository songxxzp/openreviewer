In particular, the authors claim that the proposed environment is simpler and easier for people to learn RL. While the design of the proposed environment is supported by several reference literature articles, there is no comparison studies to demonstrate that the proposed environment is simpler, easier to learn, and overall better than other existing RL learning materials.\n\nIn addition, although the evaluation results show that EduGym improves learning outcomes, this is measured by self-reported survey. There is no other evaluative methods to assess learning, nor any kind of comparison (or A/B testing) to existing tools to benchmark the effectiveness of EduGym, without which it is difficult to understand the educational utility of the proposed environment.\n\nTo summarize, 1) this paper in my opinion is a good educational contribution rather than a technical contribution, which seems to me a unsuitable contribution for ICLR; 2) the paper lacks scientific rigor in terms of evaluating the utility of EduGym."
