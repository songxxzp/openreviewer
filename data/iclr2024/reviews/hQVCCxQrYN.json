However, the author believes that it is important for a robotic system to be capable of online improvement over at least low-level control policies at the same time. Otherwise, with the lack of a library for pre-trained skills in every other scenario, robots aren't able to learn very well. To this end, the paper proposes a framework, PLAN-SEQ-LEARN, that utilizes both LLM's ability to guide agent's planning and RL's ability for online improvement. The experiments show that not only did PSL's performance surpass SOTA visual-based RL methods through the help of LLM, but it also performed better than SayCan for its ability to improve with online learning."

Did not see how the method handles this situation.\n- What would the PSL react to the situation when the agent failed to reach the termination condition?\n- What would happen if there are more than enough terms for the LLM to choose from, for example, unlearnable skill terms that may confuse the LLM in choosing?\n\n\u200b\n**Related work**\n- Although Citing 'Inner Monologue' and 'Bootstrap Your Own Skills(BOSS)', they are not used for comparison or experiments, as these methods share many similarities. Therefore, it's a bit of a missed opportunity.\n\n\u200b\n**Experimental conclusions**\n- In section 4.3, the author noted that \"For E2E and RAPS, we provide the learner access to a single global fixed view observation from O^global for simplicity and speed of execution, as we did not find meaningful performance improvement in these baselines by incorporating additional camera views.\". However, this results in an unfair comparison because PSL has taken O^local as an additional input, and may cause some questionable issues. If performances are similar, I believe that adding O^local for E2E and RAPS would result in a more convincing conclusion that PSL performs better."
