It proposes a new text-image alignment assessment benchmark (TIA2) for evaluating the problem of reward designing. It shows that several existing reward-based models are not well-aligned with human assessment after evaluated on the benchmark. The authors propose a method TextNorm to induce confidence calibration in reward models. It shows the proposed score help reduce over-optimization in the human feedback tuning. Experiments are conducted with Stable Diffusion v2.1 and LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning."

Inorder to solve this issue, they propose two techniques namely textual normalization which better normalizes the reward using contrastive text description. Further they propose textual inconsistency score, which compares the distance between the textual description and the predicted reward . They find that both these objectives help improve the calliberation and alignment with the human reward."

I would expect the right way to evaluate would be to not do early stopping and see the tradeoffs with the proposed solutions. Also talk about the benefits of not doing early stopping.\n- Further AlignProp, says that they only need to do early stopping for the Aesthetics reward function, however not for HPS v2. I think it would be worth comparing againt the HPS v2 reward function and also discuss methods such as AlignProp or DDPO (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13301) and the tricks they use to prevent overoptimization.
