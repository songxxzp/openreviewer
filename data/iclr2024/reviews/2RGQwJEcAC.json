                "value": "The study introduces an innovative and streamlined transformer block named DCS-Transformer, which facilitates channel selection for both attention weights and attention outputs. The inspiration for this channel selection arises from the information bottleneck (IB) principle. This principle strives to diminish the mutual information between the transformer block's input and output, all the while maintaining the mutual information between the output and the task label. This is chiefly realized through the use of a Gumbel-softmax and a channel-pruning loss.\n\nThe overall framework mirrors the structure presented in the Neural Architecture Search (NAS), encompassing both a search phase and a training phase. In the quest for the optimal weights for channel selection, the authors put forth an IB-associated loss for the search process. The proficiency of the presented approach is corroborated by experimental findings on ImageNet-1k and COCO."

                "value": "1. The rationale for utilizing an Information Bottleneck loss appears to be somewhat rigid and unclear to me.\n- The authors explain that the reason for employing this loss is that\n\n\n> IB prompts the network to learn features that are more strongly correlated with class labels while decreasing their correlation with the input.\n\n\nHowever, it remains unclear to me why a traditional Softmax cross-entropy loss wouldn't be adequate to address this issue effectively.\n\n2. The primary contribution of this paper doesn't seem to be particularly effective.\n\nAs per Table 6 in the appendix, the implementation of the proposed IB loss results in only a 0.3% improvement when used on the same backbone. Such a minor improvement could also be attained simply by using a more favourable random seed, which might be too trivial to serve as the main contribution of a ICLR paper.\n\n3. Some of the ablation studies on hyper-parameter search are missing.\n\nI'm intrigued by the roles of the hyper-parameters $\\eta$ and $\\lambda$ in the suggested approach. It appears that if $\\eta$ is not set to a small value, the outcomes could be inferior to the baseline. Upon examining the code, I noticed that $\\eta$ is defaulted to 0.1, which contrasts with the paper's assertion that $\\eta$ is set to 50 for ImageNet. This discrepancy could potentially be confusing for many readers.\n\n4. The discussion on related works is not comprehensive enough.\n\nThis paper introduces some techniques, e.g. channel selection with Gumbel SoftMax, and entropy minimization for architecture search, that were first applied in the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and network pruning. However, the section of related work does not include a subsection in this direction, which is inappropriate from my point of view. Some seminal works like [1, 2, 3] should be included and carefully discussed.\n\n### Reference\n\n[1] Xie S, Zheng H, Liu C, et al.

The authors may consider focusing more on illustrating their motivation and ideas instead of explaining the technical details. For example, the usage of information bottleneck in the proposed method is not well-introduced. I was expecting to see how the information bottleneck theory is integrated into the proposed architecture and the rationale behind it, but only to fine detailed derivation of the variational upper bound for the IB loss.\n\n2. Is it possible that the propose module be applied to more classical architecture of ViT, e.g., the vanilla ViT or Swin? And what would be performance if DCS is used in semantic segmentation tasks. More experimental results would make the paper more convincing.\n\n3. It seems that the authors fail to compare their method to other pruning techniques, but only show that DCS is effective as it successfully reduce the number of parameters without sacrificing the performance. I also expect a comprehensive comparison against benchmark pruning methods in term of the overall computational cost.\n\nAfter rebuttal:\nI appreciate the detailed response provided by the authors, which have solved much of my concern and lead to the increase of overall rating. I would recommend the authors to integrate the supplementary results they provide in the rebuttal phase into their manuscript, so as to make it more intuitive and convincing."
