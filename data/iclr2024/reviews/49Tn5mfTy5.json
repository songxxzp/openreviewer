Specially, for OOD detection, the setting used in the paper is previously shown to be an insufficient indicator for generalization. \n\nThe methods used for comparison do not appear to be the most recent methods in the literature.\n\nLiterature review is weak.\n\n-------\n\nThe reported accuracy of the models appear way below the standards in the literature. In Table 3, the ultimate accuracy of the calibrated model appears to be around 93% percent. Is that a model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset? If yes, then this accuracy does not seem convincing. The testing accuracy of a standard ViT model on CIFAR-10 is around 98% -- with no extra computational procedure. The accuracy of the misclassification detection method by Zhu et al for WideResNet is +97%. Why would anyone use the authors\u2019 proposed method to ultimately achieve an accuracy of 93%? Could authors extend their experiments to models with better accuracies and demonstrate that their calibration method can improve the accuracy of those models? I would suggest downloading pretrained models from the literature, e.g., the models available on HuggingFace, PyTorch library, etc.\n\n-----\n\nThe paper below demonstrates the inadequacy of evaluating OOD detection methods on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN datasets. Specifically, this reference demonstrates that when broadening the range of datasets, most of the OOD detection methods fail to generalize. Based on this, I don\u2019t find the authors' OOD experiments convincing. I suggest authors expand their experiments to the setting used in the paper below and consider more datasets, e.g., iWildCam, BREEDS, etc.\n\n\u2013 Jaeger, P.F., L\u00fcth, C.T., Klein, L. and Bungert, T.J., 2022, September.

However, it would be necessary for the paper to demonstrate its capability in comparison to the most recent methods in the literature and on standard models with good accuracy, models that are freely available in the literature.\n\n-----\n\nI found the discussion under Limitations and Future Work frank and clear, and perhaps a better explanation of the contribution of the paper. The statement of \u201cThe main focus of this work is \u2026.\u201d seemed more on point to me than some of the early statements in the paper.
