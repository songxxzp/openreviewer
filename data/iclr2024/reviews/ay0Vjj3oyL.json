                "value": "The paper discusses the challenge of accurately estimating treatment outcomes over time based on observed historical data in various fields like medicine and e-commerce. While randomized controlled trials are the ideal method, they are often impractical. Therefore, using available data, such as electronic health records or sales history, has gained interest. Estimating treatment outcomes from time series data presents unique challenges due to complex dynamics and dependencies. Existing approaches use neural networks and different training strategies to account for time-dependent factors. However, they rely heavily on supervised learning, which limits their applicability in cases with limited or no testing data. The proposed solution, Self-supervised Counterfactual Transformer (SCOT), represents a shift from supervised to self-supervised training. SCOT uses an encoder architecture with temporal and feature-wise attention to capture dependencies in both time and features. It refines the contrastive loss in self-supervised learning, comparing the entire history and individual components of covariates, treatments, and outcomes. Additionally, the paper considers the counterfactual outcome estimation problem from an unsupervised domain adaptation perspective and provides a theoretical analysis of the error bound for such estimators based on self-supervised learning representations."

Rather than directly estimating the counterfactual outcome based on a structural model, the core idea is to learn high-quality representations of observed history sequences that are informative for counterfactual treatment outcome estimation. The idea of integrating self-supervised learning (SSL) with component-specific contrastive losses is novel, which could be used to learn more informative historical representations in the temporal counterfactual outcome estimation. The paper has also provided comprehensive empirical findings using both synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing the encouraging effectiveness of the proposed approach."

However, what sets the present approach apart is its use of a transformer architecture, a notably superior choice given that transformers have demonstrated better performance than recurrent neural networks in various machine learning tasks."

Applying existing random augmentations with the component-wise contrastive loss is quite straightforward while the main part of method seems to come from the work of [1].\n2. The motivation of substantial parts of the work is often not clear and could be improved. E.g., what are the exact improvements over [1] and why are these expected to work better. Also, the used terminology for describing the setting (\u201ccold-start\u201d, \u201czero-shot transfer\u201d, \u201csource/target domain\u201d) is a bit confusing and its not quite clear how this differs from basic potential outcomes evaluation (e.g., in-sample vs out-of-sample evaluation). Especially wrt to the analogy to unsupervised domain adaption it is important to describe the exact setting more specifically (in Sec. 2 as well as in Sec 3.4., e.g., distinguish between the domain shift between the distributions conditioned on the treatments induced by the confounding bias vs. the domain shift stemming from the unconditional feature distribution shifts in source and target domains). Hence, source and target domains should be clearly defined in the Problem Formulation Sec. 2.\n3. For reproducibility, the code for the experiments should be provided.\n\nThe paper contribution should be spelled out better. If 2. the authors claim their main contribution is around UDA, why not use a better experimental setting (and more common datasets that align with UDA-ts)? Why not review the UDA for time-series stream in the related work? Why build on SOTA methods for UDA-ts? If the authors say that their main contribution is around self training ,why not use a proper method that is more grounded in the causal graph (given that the methods for data augmentation are largely 1:1 copies from Woo et al)? \n\n[1] Melnychuk, Valentyn, Dennis Frauen, and Stefan Feuerriegel. \"Causal transformer for estimating counterfactual outcomes.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. In Figure 3, the representations trained only on the self-supervised objective seem already unpredictive of the treatment. This indicates that either the dataset does not contain a high-level of confounding by default or the self-supervised learning can already balance the representations. If the latter, possible (theoretical) intuition why this works would be interesting, especially to support the use of self-supervised learning in this setting.\n2. In general, the paper could adapt more to the terminology of counterfactual vs interventional distribution of the causal ladder of Pearl. E.g., in the Figure 1, the \u201ccold-start /UDA case\u201d is an interventional question (what will happen if treatment A will be prescribed) and not a counterfactual question (what would have happened if instead of treatment B  treatment A had been prescribed). \n3. I assume that in general, the rMSE is evaluated on unconfounded test data for the semi-synthetic datasets. In Sec 4.2., does the data in the target domain leveraged for fine-tuning still contain confounding bias s.t. that the final test dataset still has a distribution shift wrt. to confounding to this data or is the confounding bias removed, here, too?"

This does not hurt its novelty, but makes it less significant as this is claimed as the top 1 contribution. I would suggest the authors to emphasize less on this part because it brings little improvement. Instead, if you delve into table 3, you will see that the main contributors are actually the encoder design and the supervision loss.

For the outcome predictor, Ht already includes treatment sequences, what is the movitation and justification for remodeling it using 2 convolution blocks? Does it imply that the latent representation of Ht could not capture the treatment sequences well? If not, can you include this in the ablation study? \n\n4: I think the Assumption B.1 is too strong. Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe it removes uncertainty. However, when given a treatment, there is still probabilities, being either high or low, of different outcomes. In that sense, B.1 is much stronger than the no unmeasured counfounding that people usually use. \n\n5: Figure 3: Pretrained is worse than the rest in separation, but there is not much difference among the remaining, right?\n\n6: I think the reporting in table 3 sounds manipulated - in each dataset, you cherrypick the best-performing supervision strategy as \"SCOT\", and the worse-performing variants as \"ablation study\".

That will be more interesting. \n2: How do you deal with missingness in the time series? This is common in healthcare dataset. \n3: Since we talked about pretraining and transfer learning, instead of showing t-sne plots which hardly differentiates NCS, CS and Transfer, I would rather want to know the model performance of pretraining without finetuning. \n4: This is minior but in Table 3 fold 2, the best one for MIMIC is actually sq. inv."
