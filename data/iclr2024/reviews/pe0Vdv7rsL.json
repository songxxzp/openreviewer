However, in fact, Table 3 shows the performance differences between experiments with and without NAM, MNP, and GT are marginal. The confidence interval of the last row and the first row (the simplest version) even overlap. The simple linear model seems to already perform very well compared to GT. A better way of justifying the impact of pretraining can be directly using linear probing on the frozen pre-trained representation.\n\n- The power of pretraining seems to be limited by the size of the dataset (around 20K patients). Under this condition, pretraining a large model may not significantly outperform a simple linear model. It will be more exciting to apply the proposed method to a larger dataset."
