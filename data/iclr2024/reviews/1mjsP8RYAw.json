How does $L_{distill}$ work at the early iterations? This is an important prerequisite that should be clearly stated in the paper. \n\n2. Why does the paper only evaluate the effect of each loss on a smaller T5 model? Considering the best performance reported in the work is based on Transformer-XL, ablation studies based on it are desired.\n\n3. The annotation in the methodology section makes me really confused. For example but not limited to:\n\n    (1) In Section 3.1, what does the V and each $v_i$ mean? I cannot get it until I read through the whole methodology section. \n\n    (2) The use of subscript and superscript is messed up. I think embedding is presented as $X_F$ in Section 3.2, but it becomes $X^F$ in Section 3.3.\n    \n    (3) Some annotations are not really necessary, e.g., $N_i$ in Equation 3 are not used anywhere else in the paper.\n\n    I encourage the authors to make Section 3 more concise and clear by better formula presenting."

However, the fact-verification model reported in section 4 is supervised. The model uses SFAVEL for mapping fact / claim to vectors and then uses a classifier trained in a supervised learning manner. \n\nSecondly, it is unclear about what is the used \"linear probe\". Fig 4b shows that the linear probe takes top evidence as input. But then how can we verify the input claim if we use only evidence (and their scores)? E.g. how knowing \"Obama was born in Hawaii\" and \"Hawaii is in the US\"  can reject a claim without knowing what the claim is? \n\nThirdly, although the performance of the proposed model is remarkable, it is unclear why there's such a big gap between it and the existing models in the literature. What are cases that the proposed model can solve but the others can? Does the model find some crucial factors that the others miss? \n\nLast but not least, the proposed SFAVEL is for learning a knowledge model. But it is unclear whether that knowledge model is useful for other fact-verification cases (like on other FEVER dataset -- FEVER 2.0 for example). Also, whether that knowledge model is also useful for other downstream task requiring fact?"

                "value": "The paper motivates the necessity of fact-verification specifically in an unsupervised way. Given that the recent works have focused on NLIs, this work focuses on a pre-training objective that includes claim-fact distillation loss, intra-sample contrastive loss, and scoring loss. These losses are determined based on the positive and negative samples and their embeddings from the knowledge-base conditioned on the claim. The overall goal is to pre-train this model in the context of available knowledge base to verify facts. The results show that the model performs well on FEVER dataset. \n\nConcerns of this work: \n1. Size of the models: Given the aspect of large language models where the sizes are in billions, the evaluation is performed on smaller models. Is there some conclusion that can be made with these smaller models instead of just mentioning that the results are good?\n2. Datasets: The work has been evaluated only on one single dataset which begs the question of generalizability. Some works such as [1, 2] have evaluated on other datasets such as UKP and FEVER 2 etc. How does this work compare to those? This is particularly necessary because of the use of Wikidata5m knowledge-base that is used. If it is outside the context of Wikipedia, how can this approach work for other knowledge-bases?\n3. Comparisons to other approaches: The top-k fact retrieval seems to play an important role, given that the recall in number of facts is improved based on the ranking your approach has, is it a fair comparison to other approaches that work on probably the only retrieved fact? If K=1 then the dev numbers are not comparable to any of the approaches mentioned in the paper. \n4. Self-supervision: There is a strong assumption that there is availability of a knowledge base - Wikidata5m and since Fever is derived from it, the losses are carried between facts from Wikidata and Fever claims. Would be good to clarify why the authors think this is self-supervised? \n\n\n[1]: Incorporating External Knowledge for Evidence-based Fact Verification\n[2]: Retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive nlp tasks"

                "value": "This paper focused on unsupervised fact verification --- verifying a claim based on a trustworthy knowledge base without a requirement of direct supervision. The author proposed to train a scoring model on top of embeddings produced by a pre-trained language model to determine whether a given claim can be aligned to a fact from knowledgebase. The scoring model is trained by leveraging positive and negative examples constructed based on triples from a knowledge graph. The author conducted experimental evaluations on FEVER, and showed that their method can yield a significant improvement over SOTA."

                "value": "1. The author's idea of leveraging a knowledge graph to produce positive and negative examples of unlabeled claims to train a scoring model is creative. \n2. The paper is very well-structured, and easy to follow.\n3. The experiments presented promising results on FEVER (~8% improvement on accuracy), and the method can work on a broad set of language models."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The technique proposed in the paper does not seem to be generalizable. Specifically, the positive and negative examples constructed through triples from knowledge graph are too simple, which makes this method difficult to generalize to more complicated claims. Specifically, triples can only represent who did what, while in reality, a claim can be who did what at where on when for why.  Any wrong information about these factors can make a claim false. While it is not clear to me how the current method can learn a model that can be effectively aware of some more fine-grained factual differences.\n2. The experimental setup is limited. The evaluations are only based on FEVER, which is not convincing. FEVER is created through Wikipedia, and Wikipedia information is closer to triples, which is bias to author's method and training process. At least, an experiment to show the effectiveness of this method on other fact verification dataset would be very helpful.\n3. Ranking may not be the best problem formulation for fact verification. For claim verification, it is important to help people decide whether they should believe the claim or not. Now the author formulates this problem as a ranking problem, which is not very useful from a fact verification perspective. it is not clear what does it mean to the user that a claim can find a piece of evidence with 0.9 score."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. How this method is different from a ranking/retrieval problem? Is fact verification equivalent to ranking/retrieval?\n2. How would this method work on other datasets that are not created based on Wikipedia?"
