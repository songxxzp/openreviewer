It follows the basic framework of training representations on augmented views of give images, like in contrastive learning. The core components are 1) an online network that predicts the representation as a distribution rather than a deterministic vector; 2) a target network that can be seen as an mean teacher.  Learning is accomplished based on proper scoring rules."

Maybe the performance on in-domain and out-of-domain expereiments show the representation is better, but I cannot justify if or not this were because the collapse problem is mitigated. \nI believe this work would be definitely more technically sound If authors provide more qualititive or quantatitive results that can directly reflect the level of collapse,"

                "value": "1. There are some typos in the article, affecting the overall readability of the paper. \n- In Table 3, should \"PN\" be replaced with \"PL\"? The experimental setups in the first and last rows of Table 3 are exactly the same. Is this an error?\n- In the last sentence of the third paragraph in Chapter 4, should \"$\\mu $\" and \"$\\sigma $\" have the superscript \"i\"? As per my understanding, \"$\\mu $\" and \"$\\sigma $\" vary for each data point.\n- In the eighth line of the abstract, there is a semicolon. I believe using a comma would be more appropriate.\n\n2. The article uses a self-distillation mechanism for learning, but the description of the learning mechanism is not clear. The third paragraph of Chapter 5 contains a sentence that says, \"The target network has the same backbone and projection as the online network and it learns through self-distillation\". The target network is updated through the strategy of EMA, and I think the online network could be regarded as learning through self-distillation. Is there a mistake here, or is my understanding off? In addition, there are some mistakes in the descriptions of the distillation mechanism of DINO in the second paragraph of Chapter 2. The parameters of the teacher model, rather than the student model, are obtained through EMA.\n\n3. The association between the probabilistic method and the prevention of dimensional collapse still requires further elaboration and demonstration. In the second paragraph of Chapter 1, the authors give two possible causes for the dimensional collapse. Is the author's solution inspired by either of the two causes or did it address either of the two factors? I think this needs to be further explained. I suggest two additional experiments in the following areas:\n- Ablation experiments with the removal of \"$\\sigma $\" and the second term Equation 2. I think it is necessary to illustrate the effectiveness of the probabilistic approach.\n- Performance comparison with various baseline methods for the same feature dimensions. \n- In Figure 3d, the dimension of the largest embedding vector is 16000, which I think is not large enough and should be further increased for experiments. As far as I know, many self-supervised methods, such as Barlow Twins, are capable of not collapsing completely in a dimension of 16000. I suggest that the authors can show that their proposed method does not collapse completely in larger dimensions. It would be better if the authors could somehow demonstrate that their method improves the effective dimensions of the learned features."

Since your scoring function is a variation of $L_2$ loss between $z_i$ and $z_{\\xi}$, can you show that the variational encoding actually makes a difference by perturbing $t_\\theta$ by a Gaussian noise of $\\sigma = \\epsilon$\n3. The authors claim that their method is superior in terms of preventing the collapse of representation, can you provide an experiment specific to this to highlight that the representations learned by ProSMin mitigate this problem? This is important because the authors claim that strong augmentations distort the underlying distribution, hence promoting the collapse of the representations learned. If learning the representations via a parametric distribution that utilizes the resampling trick of sampling from a Gaussian distribution, is it not effectively an augmentation in the representation space?"
