That is, typical Riemannian manifolds such as the cone of SPD matrices or a Grassman manifold go largely un mentioned. The authors focus on specific manifolds which could be interesting such as the Stanford bunny, but I lack to see the importance/applicability of it.

To me, the difference of this work with [1] is only the different ways of representing points on the Riemannian manifold, where [1] directly use some coordinate since the manifolds we consider are always embedded, and this work uses the leading eigen-function of the LBO to approximate the points. It remains not very clear why and how LBO sign-functions outperforms a plain coordinate approach, or a local chart approach (since for every point on the manifold we have a local coordinate chart). Calculating eigen-functions of LBO potentially also consumes time. A more elaborative discussion of different approaches to do the embedding seems necessary.\n\n2. The authors choose the top k LBO eigen-functions to do the embedding. is there a guidance on how to determine k?\n\n3. Regarding Algorithm 2: First, what\u2019s $M_q$, which seems to exist in [1] but not here? Second why do we need a random subset $C_{t}$? I thought we just need the same context and query sets as in Algorithm 1.\n\n4. Regarding the numerical experiments, I\u2019m particularly interested in the ERA5 dataset, which seems to be the only natural instance of manifold-supported distributions. It would be interesting to see how the proposed algorithm performs in terms of COV and MMD for this dataset, comparing to other algorithms as DPF and GASP.\n\nReferences: \n[1] Zhuang, Peiye, et al. \"Diffusion probabilistic fields.\"\u00a0The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations. 2022."

This is supported by a sufficient amount of experimental evidence, which explores most practical questions about such a change in representation.\n\nInterestingly, the paper also shows the robustness of the model to rigid transformations on the manifold, having a much more appropriate behavior in this case than the model it is mostly based on."

Understandably, in many scenarios it is not possible to analytically solve this problem, but it is unclear how challenging it is to adapt the ideas presented here to scenarios where it is possible (or how beneficial that is). A simple fix to this issue, in my opinion, is to claim what is being extensively evaluated experimentally: graphs/meshes as an approximation of a manifold.\n\n**Update after rebuttal**\n\nThe authors have updated their paper to clarify their claims and point out the equivalence, at least in one experiment, of their use of graph Laplacians to the analytical LBO (Table 5 shows results of this case). After reading the comments of other reviewers and the rebuttals, I am increasing my score to 8."
