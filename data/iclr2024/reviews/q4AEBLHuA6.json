                "value": "The weaknesses of this submission are mostly presentational (with two exceptions that concern the experiments).\nI believe the following issues can _and should_ all be corrected before publication.\n\n\n1. The manuscript misses a range of closely related work about solving partial differential equations with Gaussian processes:\n\n    * Howhadi [1] discusses Bayesian numerical homogenisation (solving multi-scale PDEs with GPs), a central piece of related work that this paper should address prominently. \n    * Accessing the derivatives of the Gaussian process as a function of $\\vec{\\mathcal{U}}$ (the trick suggested in Equation (13)) is discussed in Section 2 and Section 3 in the paper by Kr\u00e4mer et al. [2].\n    * The related work section (Section 5) mentions the work on solving PDEs with GPs by Chen et al. (2021) and Long et al. (2022b) but completely misses all work that belongs to the field of probabilistic numerical algorithms (see, for instance, [1-3] below and the references therein).\n\n    I am aware that large parts of the ICLR community may be more familiar with physics-informed neural networks than with Gaussian-process-based differential-equation solvers and that taking this into account for the exposition therefore makes sense for an ICLR paper. However, the works mentioned above are closely related and must be discussed appropriately.\n\n2. I am surprised the submission never mentions traditional approaches to solving multi-scale problems, such as those based on numerical homogenisation (a starting point could be [4]). I know that the paper targets the ICLR community and that large parts of this community may be more interested in machine-learning-based PDE solvers than traditional PDE solvers. Still, existing approaches should be credited by (at least) mentioning their existence. (This relates to point 4. below)\n\n3. I am also surprised that the experiments only discuss the precision of the approximations rather than the work required to achieve this precision. The experiments in Appendix C suggest that the per-iteration runtime of the proposed algorithm is comparable to that of a physics-informed neural network. However, Figure 9 indicates that tens of thousands of iterations are needed. What is each algorithm's overall runtime (training time) to achieve the precisions in Tables 1 and 2?\n\n4. What would we find if we included a non-machine-learning-based solver in the experiments and compared the runtime to the accuracy of all these methods? I would like to see this comparison. I am not saying that the proposed method must outperform traditional solvers, which have been studied and optimised for a long time, but that the context is critical.\n\n\n5. This could be personal taste, but I think the paper might benefit from a slightly more rigorous notation surrounding Equation (14), for instance, by clarifying which joint probability density Equation (14) is the logarithm of. I am imagining something like mentioning $$\n\\mathcal{L} = \\log p(\\mathcal{U}, \\mathcal{H} \\mid \\Theta, \\tau_1, \\tau_2)$$ somewhere at the beginning of Section 4. Contextualising this term against the maximum-a-posteriori and maximum-likelihood loss for the same estimation problem would be even better. What do the authors think?\n\n\nI consider points 1 and 2 essential and 3 and 5 slightly less important to resolve before publication. \nI expect all four of those issues to be relatively straightforward to fix.\nPoint 4 would be optional, as incorporating it is non-trivial. However, I would like to see those results.\n\nI am open to revising my score once these issues have been addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Howhadi, Bayesian numerical homogenization.

I believe that the two differences are: (1) The use of student-t distribution and (2) using a Kronecker product grid to speed-up computations. In the current version, the title and abstract of the paper might be misleading to readers in the sense that this paper is not the first one to consider solving a PDE with GP.\n- I am very surprised by the Spectral method experiment performed by the authors. A quick experiment with Chebfun (https://www.chebfun.org/) allows me to solve the 1D Poisson equation to 10 digits accuracy in a fraction of a second.\n- The authors state at the end of Section 5 that their work is \"the first to [...] use the Kronecker product structure to efficiently solve PDEs\". I believe this sentence is erroneous. It is completely natural when using spectral methods to exploit the Kronecker product structure of the domain (see e.g. Fortunato & Townsend, 2019).\n- The authors offer very little conclusion and the main limitation section from the Appendix should appear in the main text. One of the key limitation of the method is that it is limited to simple geometry, where one can use a Kronecker product structure. However, this severely limits the applicability of the method and questions its advantages over spectral methods."

Quote from the Abstract (also mentioned in contributions): \"The covariance derived from the Gaussian mixture spectrum corresponds to the known spectral mixture kernel. We are the \ufb01rst to discover its rationale and effectiveness for PDE solving.\" In my opinion, this is incorrect. H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen et al. (2023) construct a specific kernel for linear PDEs, which as they write explicitly at the end of Section 4.1 recovers the spectral mixture kernel (Wilson et al. 2013) as a special case.\n2. \"By contrast, for PDE solving, it is natural to estimate the solution values on a grid, which opens the possibility of using Kronecker products for ef\ufb01cient computation. To our knowledge, our work is the \ufb01rst to realize this bene\ufb01t and use the Kronecker product structure to ef\ufb01ciently solve PDEs.\"I disagree with this being the first instance of Kronecker product structure being used to efficiently solved PDEs. First of all, Kronecker product structure (on regular grids) is being used to solve PDEs (either via preconditioners or via the connection of separation of variables and tensor numerical methods (e.g. Gavrilyuk et al. 2019)). Second, as the authors mention themselves in the manuscript, the computational efficiency of product kernels on regular grids is well-known for GPs (Saatci, 2012). Further, PDE solvers based on GPs which use tensor product kernels (specifically Matern) have also been proposed previously (e.g. Wang et al. 2021).\n\n## Quality of Presentation\nThe paper is generally well-written and easy to understand. The ideas were presented in a coherent way and accessible to readers outside the specific subfield. The plots were largely informative, but I would have preferred larger plots to make them more legible. \n\n## Theoretical Results\nThe theoretical results are mostly standard applications of known results and look correct to me, although I did not check every derivation in detail.\n\n## Experimental Evaluation\nThe experimental evaluation is largely well-done. I have some questions about the baselines that are compared against. Specifically, the vanilla GP baseline with a Matern kernel. Is this using a product kernel? The authors write in the paper that \"[...] it is extremely costly or practically infeasible for the existent GP solvers to incorporate massive collocation points, due to the huge covariance matrix.\". Why should one not be able to leverage the Kronecker product + Toeplitz structure (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of Wilson et al. 2015) of a product of Matern kernels for the vanilla GP case as well? If this was not done here, the baseline that is presented here seems rather weak. I can imagine that a scale mixture still outperforms a vanilla Matern kernel, but the performance gap in terms of time and memory should be significantly smaller I would expect.\n\n## Related Work\nThe paper discusses related work from the domain of PINNs well, but misses some of the work on Gaussian-process based PDE solvers. For example, the following papers used GPs to solve PDEs:\n\n- J. Cockayne, C. Oates, T. Sullivan, M.

                "value": "- What about the marginal uncertainty output by the Gaussian process? Does it capture the approximation error of the mean or is it miscalibrated? \n- What's the impact of the number of components of the mixture kernel on the approximated solution? An ablation such as a plot of number of components vs error would be informative. Also how does it affect the difficulty of the optimization problem? I could imagine choosing too many components makes the optimization problem significantly harder to solve in practice.\n- Do the kernel matrices you define have Toeplitz structure? Stationary kernels on a 1D grid would have. This could further accelerate the required computations (see Section 3.2. of Wilson et al. 2015)."
