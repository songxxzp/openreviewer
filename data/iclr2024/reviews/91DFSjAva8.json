I strongly suggest the authors proof-reading the paper thoroughly to make it a stronger submission. See detailed comments below.\n- From Fig. 1, it seems that CQL-SERA > Cal-QL-SERA > Cal-QL baseline > CQL baseline, which contradicts to the empirical findings in Fig. 4.\n- Is the unbiasedness of SERA theoretically guaranteed by replacing V function by Q function? If not, it is kind of over-claiming in Introduction.\n- Please conduct sufficient research investigation on offline-to-online RL.

Please discuss advantages of SERA over them.\n- In Section 3.1:\n\n(1) $d_\\mathcal{D}$ is not defined.\n\n(2) Should not J(Q) be a MSE loss?\n\n(3) In $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\pi}Q(s,a)$, the condition of the expectation is $s \\sim \\mathcal{D}$?\n\n(4) Eq.(1) seems incorrect. Check Eq. (3.1) in Cal-QL paper.\n\n(5) what is $s_i^{knn}$ in Eq.(2)?\n\n- In Section 3.2:\n\n(1) Eq.(4) seems incorrect. Please double-check.\n\n(2) Overall, I cannot follow details in Section 3.2. Please provide step-by-step instructions in Appendix to make it more clear.\n\n- In Section 4.1, Isn\u2019t SERA a generic offline-to-online RL algorithm? Why the training objective is constrained to the framework of CQL and Cal-QL?\n- Moreover, this paper claims to have an appendix pdf, but I cannot find the appendix in openreview.\n- Why experiments are only conducted on 8 selected tasks. In general, MuJoCo has random/medium/medium-replay/medium-expert/etc. datasets. Consider these settings.\n- It seems that there are only one random seed throughout the paper. Please repeat all the experiments with at least three different random seeds to control the randomness. Also, please report the mean and std value.\n- Please consider more sufficient comparison in Fig. 5. Besides, in ant-medium, where is TD3+BC? In ant, halfcheetah, and walker2d, IQL seems performs better than IQL-SERA. Could you provide more explanations?\n- Why only two tasks are selected in Fig. 6 (a)?\n- Why only IQL is selected in Fig. 6 (b) on only two tasks?\n- There are no sufficient ablation studies on each component of SERA. For example, you claim that condition on Q is better than V, thus, please derive some empirical findings to support this claim.\n- Some typos:\n\n(1) Reference format is not well-handled throughout the paper.

The exploration of the offline-to-online problem in this study holds great relevance and is imperative for practical implementations, aligning seamlessly with the demands of real-world situations.\n2. The fundamental idea at the core of this study is firmly grounded. While the concept presented in this paper is rather straightforward, involving the introduction of an exploration strategy during the online phase to enhance performance, the specific exploration technique employed is quite novel and has demonstrated favorable results in the experiments."

                "value": "1. In the experimental section, the author conducted experiments solely on the medium dataset in MuJoCo. However, according to the consensus in the field of offline-to-online research, it is generally recommended to perform experiments on at least three types of datasets: medium, medium-replay, and medium-expert, in order to validate the effectiveness of the method.\n2. The method proposed in this paper is primarily an extension of CQL and Cal-QL. However, in the context of the offline-to-online field, the actual compared baselines are limited to AWAC and Cal-QL. It is advisable for the authors to consider comparing their method with other more efficient algorithms such as Balanced Replay[1], PEX[2], and ENOTO[3].\n3. The SERA algorithm, proposed in this paper, primarily enhances online performance by designing intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. This concept has been mentioned in previous works such as O3F[4] and ENOTO, although SERA employs different exploration methods. While introducing exploration during the online phase can enhance performance, it may introduce another challenge: instability due to distribution shift, which can lead to performance degradation in the early stages of online learning. This issue has been discussed in many offline-to-online works and is a critical metric in this field. However, it might not be very evident on the medium dataset. Therefore, the authors should consider conducting additional experiments on the medium-replay and medium-expert datasets to verify whether performance degradation occurs.\n4. In Figure 4, the experimental results for the Antmaze environment are challenging to discern, as the curves for various algorithms are intertwined and unclear. The author should consider optimizing the representation of these experimental results for better clarity.\n5. In Table 1, only the mean values of the algorithm results are presented, with a lack of information regarding the errors or variances associated with these results.\n\n[1] Lee S, Seo Y, Lee K, et al.
