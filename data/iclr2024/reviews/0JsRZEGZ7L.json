DCM is designed to compute cell probabilities within the complex, thus enhancing downstream tasks. They show how to integrate DCM with cell complex message-passing network layers and train it in an end-to-end fashion, offering significant improvements, especially in cases where an input graph is not provided. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets."

Please reorganize it for readers to follow the description.\n- Notably, there is no dedicated \"Reproducibility Statement\" section in the paper, which hinders providing clear instructions for reproducing the results.

The following few questions might help the authors to refine the section.\n- In the paragraph above 'Remark 2', the layer normalization $\\mathcal{LN}$ is employed. If I understand correctly, $\\mathcal{LN}$ actually works on vectors of similarities. Thus is it really precise to call it as layer normalization?\n- In the same paragraph, the threshold of assigning an edge is set as $0$. Is there any ablation study on the selection of this threshold?\n- In the same paragraph, what is 'parameter $\\alpha$'? Is it mentioned before?\n- In Eqn. (5), how to get $\\mathcal{B}(\\sigma_i^1)$?\n- Similarly, in Eqn. (9),  how to get $\\mathcal{CB}(\\sigma_i^0)$?\n- As shown in Table 2, the performance of DCM is higher without an initial graph than with an initial graph. What could be the possible reason behind this observation?\n- How to modify the proposed method to make it work for directed complexes?\n\nI will raise my score if my concerns are correctly addressed."

Their method extends the Differentiable Graph Module (DGM) (Kazi 2022) to Diff. Cell Module (DCM). They also use $\\alpha$-maxent instead of gumball softmax. As I understand it, the procedure involves: \n1. Get auxiliary node features $x_{0,aux}= \\nu (x_{0,in})$ from inputs $x_{0,in}$, (via GNN, if a graph is given, or MLP otherwise).\n2. Use $\\alpha$-maxent to infer a graph (1-simplex). \n3. Build higher order cells (e.g. faces, volumes etc) using message passing (MP) on the inferred lower-order cells (e.g. edges) \n4. Do MP for inference using cell complex conv nets (CCCN). \n\nIn the paper, they mostly only discuss up to 2-simplexes, with the Polygon Inference Module (PIM), and not higher simplexes.  \n\nThey conduct a set of experiments on the usual graph benchmarks and show superior performance against a few baselines, including DGM. Most notably, they point out that most graph based methods (if the graph is similarity based) do not perform well on heterophilic datasets. They find that their method (using 2-simplexes) usually outperforms other methods."

For eq (6), is there a reasoning saying higher order correlations would be weaker, e.g. randomness of $x_{1,int}$? In principle, you could also consider any contraction, including products of all three $ x(i),x(j),x(v)$. \n3. Table 1, with graph, in about half of the cases GCN outperforms all higher order methods. Any intuition on why? When should we expect higher topology to matter?   \n4.
