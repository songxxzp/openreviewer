The results demonstrate consistent gains across tasks and benchmarks."

Furthermore, it is worth investigating whether the proposed method has already been considered in the distiller's search work, as exemplified by KD-Zero: Evolving Knowledge Distiller for Any Teacher-Student Pairs (NeurIPS-2023).\n\n- In addition, the paper should incorporate a thorough discussion of relevant KD-related studies, including Self-Regulated Feature Learning via Teacher-free Feature Distillation (ECCV2022), NORM: Knowledge Distillation via N-to-One Representation Matching (ICLR2023), Shadow Knowledge Distillation: Bridging Offline and Online Knowledge Transfer (NIPS2022), DisWOT: Student Architecture Search for Distillation Without Training (CVPR2023), and Automated Knowledge Distillation via Monte Carlo Tree Search (ICCV2023).
