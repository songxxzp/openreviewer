Specifically, under certain settings of PGMs and different ways to measure their complexity, the paper studies to what extent MPNNs can approximate node and edge marginals which are obtained from local minima of Bethe approximation. The analysis is also extended to other GNN variants. To equip GNNs with the power of estimating more complex node and edge marginals, phantom nodes and edges are proposed respectively, and experiments are conducted on several node and link prediction datasets to evaluate the proposed methods."

A more comprehensive discussion about the connection may mitigate the issue.\n2. Following the above point, the analysis does not take into account node features, whereas in many PGMs node and clique potentials are functions on node features. This further stresses the point that the setup might deviate from practice.\n3. The proposed method seems not scalable as it requires identifying maximum cliques that is exponentially complex, and even relaxing it to cliques with size k has super-quadratic complexity O(n^k) (please correct me if I am wrong). This limitation has not been discussed in the paper, and experiments only include small datasets.\n4. The experimental results are relatively weak. E.g. on PPI, best performance in most cases (4 out of 6 columns in the table) is achieved by GCNII+SPN. Improvement on synthetic dataset is also limited, and Planetoid dataset is outdated. Baselines are also limited. Particularly, many GNN variants are considered in the analysis but are not compared in experiments, and I wonder why? Moreover, the proposed methods are essentially based on data augmentation, but competitors in this category are missing.\n\nTypos: invalid reference in appendix A and E.2; \u201ca successful ? for minimizing\u201d in 3.2; repeated references Bergen et al. and Cai \nat al."

The paper challenges the prevailing notion that GNNs necessitate integration with graphical models to enhance their probabilistic inference capacity, asserting that GNNs intrinsically possess robust approximation capabilities for posterior distributions. The research introduces a new expressive power hierarchy using Markov Random Fields (MRFs) with increasingly complex distributions and inference targets, providing insights into various GNN variants, including MPNNs, higher-order GNNs, subgraph GNNs, and labeling tricks in the contexts of node classification and link prediction. Furthermore, the paper presents a systematic framework for extending the capabilities of GNNs in modeling complex distributions and inference targets, with a particular focus on phantom nodes and phantom edges, showcasing their empirical improvements in real-world applications of GNNs."

These works do not ignore dependency among the nodes, which is captured via multiple rounds of message passing similar to loopy belief propagation. I find the first paragraph could be phrased in a different way to make the distinctions accurate.\n1. The introduction of phantom nodes and edges is not a novel development and closely resembles the other methods like CIN. However, the problem of inefficiency remains in such methods i.e. the computational complexity of finding maximal cliques which can be used for phantom nodes to guarantee the inferential capacity.\n1. Certain related works are missing in the paper. Recent works on Factor Graph Neural Networks (FGNN) [1] are highly related works in establishing connections between PGMs and GNNs. A small discussion on the relevance would be pertinent. \n1. The experimental section could be more elaborate to study the effectiveness of GNNs in learning higher-order distributions. For example, comparison with Zhen et al.

                "value": "The authors report a slate of new theoretical results regarding the expressive power of a variety of GNNs w.r.t. MRFs. Utilizing this theoretical basis, they then propose a novel extension of MPNNs utilizing so-called \"phantom nodes/edges\". These proposed algorithms are tested using synthetic and real world data, comparing against state-of-the-art algorithms. \n\nIn node classification tasks, the phantom node lifting method improved state of the art when applied on GCN, and compared well to recent works when utilized with SAGE and GCNII methodologies. In link prediction, phantom edges proved to improve all compared results using standard datasets and metrics.\n\nIn summary, recasting GNN's expressibility via MRF, the authors were able to improve the understanding of MPNNs and used this probabilistic viewpoint to introduce a novel methodology that matches or outperforms the current state-of-the-art in standard tests."

                "value": "The paper makes two contributions: (1) improving the theoretical understanding of GNNs utilizing a probabilistic viewpoint to classify expressibility with respect to (and beyond) Weisfeiler-Lehman tests and (2) utilizing this probabilistic viewpoint to propose a novel methodology to lift the expressive power of MPNNs.\n\nRecasting the question of expressiveness from limited WL tests into a probabilistic frame is natural in the setting of ML, and as shown, lucrative."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the results are compelling - I find the exposition of the novel phantom node/edge methodology lacking. While proofs are given on their approximation power, and one can assume motivation from framed previous works, the paper would be strengthened with the motivation driving the methodology.\n\nFurther, after the long theoretical exposition, the analysis of the proposed method is brief, and restricted mainly to results. A longer discussion of the modified properties (and potential limitations) of the graph would allow more informed adoption."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Question: It seems that DropGNN (perhaps applied to a slightly modified graph) is closely related to the proposed PN method. How do the two compare in inference tasks?\n\n2. Suggestion: I find the paper would be strengthened by a more direct discussion of the origins of the methodology (i.e., how does this differ/extend from previous works? E.g. node labeling)"
