Their experiments suggest that (1) MBR/QE finetuning alone are worse than vanilla finetuning with human references using the same high-quality data; (2) self-MBR/QE finetuning can complement finetuning on a small dataset of high-quality human references; and (3) using MBR/QE data generated by a stronger teacher model further improves quality.

Reranking methods, in particular, rely on good quality estimation models that exist for MT but may not exist for other tasks. Of course, MBR finetuning can be applied to other NLG tasks (e.g., summarization) but this paper does not touch this problem. I think the authors should either revise the writing and make the scope more clear from the beginning, or perform experiments in other NLG tasks. The contribution is mainly empirical and only validated for MT. \n- The study is limited in terms of language coverage. They perform experiments on 2 language pairs only (mid & high resource), both for translation out of English. It\u2019s not clear if the findings hold for lower resource languages and when translating into English. In particular, I\u2019m expecting quality estimation models to be worse for low resource languages, which may end up affecting the quality of the translations produced with their method. Have you tried other languages? If so, what happens in that case?\n- The related work discusses other methods for training NMT models beyond MLE (e.g., RL methods) but none of them is used as a baseline."

                "value": "I left some questions in the weaknesses part. Other comments/questions: \n\n- MBR decoding uses BLEURT and is prohibitively expensive. Note, however, that more efficient alternatives exist. See implementation details discussed in [1], Section 4.3. Is there a reason to choose BLEURT? While efficiency at inference time is an advantage, MBR/QE finetuning is expensive at training time. It would be good to see some numbers to understand the training/inference time difference when compared to other existing approaches.\n- In the introduction you say that MBR decoding requires the generation of a large number of candidates. While this is true if you get unbiased samples from the model, it does not seem to be the case when you bias the distribution (e.g., using nucleus sampling). I suggest you see the discussions in [2] and [3] and comment. Also, see my comment above about [1]. \n- Results use COMET-20 instead of more recent versions already available online such as COMET-22. Is there a reason for using the 2020 version?\n- Human evaluation results are important and should not be in the appendix (Table 7). In fact, I think they should be more highlighted in the paper! It would also be interesting to see if they generalize for En-Ja. Can you explain the reasoning for using 9 professional translators for En-De instead of using fewer and evaluate En-Ja as well?\n- What happens if you decode with reranking techniques (QE/MBR) using a model trained with your method, instead of using beam/greedy search? Even though this would make the method very inefficient at inference time, it would be interesting to see if it further boosts the performance.\n- According to Table 3, both beam and greedy search work well. Does this mean that your method helps solve the beam search curse [4]? What happens when you increase the beam width?\n\n[1] Identifying Weaknesses in Machine Translation Metrics Through Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding: A Case Study for COMET (Amrhein & Sennrich, AACL-IJCNLP 2022)\n\n[2] Quality-Aware Decoding for Neural Machine Translation (Fernandes et al., NAACL 2022).\n\n[3] An Empirical Study of Translation Hypothesis Ensembling with Large Language Models (Farinhas et al., EMNLP 2023).\n\n[4] Six Challenges for Neural Machine Translation (Koehn & Knowles, NGT 2017)."
