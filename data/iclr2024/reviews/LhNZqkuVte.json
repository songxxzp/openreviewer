I understand that incremental architecture methods are no longer dominating this field of research but it does not mean that they can ignore regularization or representation based methods. For example, FeCAM [1] does not even need to know the task index and it still outperforms the author's method.\n- The amount of experimental result is severely insufficient. According to the paper, HyperMask is superior to other methods only in Split-Cifar100 and in my knowledge this is not the best one in continual learning. Please refer to [1].\n- Almost all techniques utilized in this paper are brought from previous works and I'm not sure if this is something new in CIL. Also if the authors were to mention about Lottery-ticket hypothesis, I think there should be something more than this. This method looks like a combination of HAT and PackNet to me.\n\n[1] Goswami, Dipam, et al. \"FeCAM: Exploiting the Heterogeneity of Class Distributions in Exemplar-Free Continual Learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.14062 (2023)."

HyperMask involves parameters such as \u03b2, \u03bb, and p, and while the authors mention the hyperparameter optimization process, they do not offer specific recommendations or insights on how to choose these hyperparameters effectively. \n4.
