Creation of fair baselines where a reasonable method for training binary networks should be combined with LT methods. Hence, the current comparisons provided are unfair and require improvement. Some approaches from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08562.pdf could be handy.\n\nMissing References: Recently some works have been proposed which use flatness in long-tail learning which can be used for learning quantized networks on LT data. See [R1, R2, R3].\n\nSetup: The pre-trained model used for distillation is trained on some other dataset, and hence doesn\u2019t posses the same LT distribution as on target dataset. Hence, it\u2019s unclear whether the LT classes in target dataset really constitute the long tail distribution or not.\n\n[R1]: Foret, Pierre, et al. \"Sharpness-aware minimization for efficiently improving generalization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.01412 (2020).\n\n[R2]: Na, Clara, Sanket Vaibhav Mehta, and Emma Strubell. \"Train flat, then compress: Sharpness-aware minimization learns more compressible models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.12694 (2022).\n\n[R3]: Rangwani, Harsh, Sumukh K.

One of the underlying motivations for addressing the long-tailed recognition problem stems from the inherent imbalances frequently encountered in natural datasets.\n- It is advisable to update the set of compared methods in the experimental evaluation, as the current selection appears somewhat outdated. A more comprehensive comparison with contemporary methodologies is suggested.\n- The mechanism by which the parameter $\\lambda_\\phi$ facilitates generalization across multiple data distributions remains unclear. In Figure 6, it is evident that, across all datasets, $\\lambda_\\phi$ consistently converges to a value of 1, indicating that towards the conclusion of the training process, improvements are predominantly focused on the classifier rather than the encoder.
