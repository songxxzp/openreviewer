It should be explained clearly why you need to use a neuroevolution technique instead of a more classical technique\n- 2) Maybe the naming is a bit confusing, if the method proposed is meant to distill the dataset only (and not train on it later), then it would be clearer to name the experiments as Method + HADES (whenever training a method on top of hallucinated dataset).\n- 3) If I understood correctly, one advantage of HADES is that it can distill behaviour by looking at some subpart of the episode (like 1/10th), and condense the gathered state-action pairs into much smaller dataset. However, from the rest of the paper, it's not clear whether they are some computational advantages of training on top of these condensed dataset. They should be made clearer. Indeed, by looking at the RL plots, in most of the cases, it's not clear if the red curve trains way faster than the green curve (apart from a few environments like humanoid and breakout-miniAtari"

                "value": "- 1) If I understand correctly, HADES first distills a dataset into a condensed state-action pair and then trains a classical policy on it (as in classical dataset distillation). What I don't understand is the link with the neuroevolution part. Is this part requires only for distillation or is it also required for training on top of the distilled dataset ? In the latter case, it would be interesting to see how other methods that do not use neuroevolution perform when trained on the condensed dataset.\n- 2) In the results plot of reinforcement learning, does the number of generation directly correlates to the training time ? Or are some generations quicker to run for methods trained on condensed dataset (that implies the inner loop would be faster I guess) ? I think the computational advantage of training on top of condensed dataset (if any) should be made clearer"

Then, synthetic (state, action) pairs are optimized by gradient ascent where  the gradient is estimated by evolution strategies (ES).

                "value": "While the authors creatively incorporate dataset distillation into RL setting, there are some weaknesses mainly lie on the motivation and experiments, which hurt the contribution of this manuscript. \n\n**Q1:** Sec. 1 states that this work is \"motivated by the challenge of behaviour distillation\", while this (challenge) is not a clear motivation for developing the behaviour distillation. What is the advantages of using the distilled dataset in RL except for fast training? In my opinion, the networks in RL are often small and do not require long time training. \n\n**Q2:** While I am not an expert in RL, I note that the authors employ different networks to run HaDES and the vanilla ES baseline due to \"memory constraints\" so that HaDES outperforms vanilla ES, while synthetic datasets often largely underperform the real data in dataset distillation. It will be more reasonable to compare HaDES and vanilla ES under the same experimental settings. Moreover, it will make this work more convincing to add the results of other RL methods instead of only ES.\n\n**Q3**: There lack of experiments investigating the influence of the distill budget (the size of the distlled dataset) on the final performance.\n\n**Q4**: It will make this work more comprehensive if there is an analysis of efficiency. In detail, the author can list the GPU time of behaviour distillation, training on distilled dataset, vanilla ES and other RL methods, which can further highlight the importance of behaviour distillation.\n\nBased on these observations, I think this manuscript is marginally below the acceptance, but I would like to increase my rating if the above questions are well addressed. Below are some minor questions and typos.\n\n---\n\nMinors and typos:\n1. The term Behavior Distillation has already been used in [1], which is borrowed from the concept of knowledge distillation instead of dataset distillation. The authors should discuss this to avoid ambiguity.\n\n2. The algorithm 1 should be placed in the main text for clear illustration.\n\n2.
