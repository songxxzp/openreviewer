The paper argue that their simulator is `lightweight and calibrated`, and `balance between speed and fidelity`, yet I did not get why this work make a better balance, can you make this statement more clear and highlight what is the difference of this work compared with previous ones in detail? \n\n6.

The lack of quantitative technical detail and contents. Overall, the paper was written in a qualitative way such that it requires many technical clarifications in RL settings, specific reward function, HVAC simulation model, notations, etc.\n\n2. No justification for simulation model simplification. Though the authors claim their simulator is lightweight, they need simplification on their simulation model. For example, their simulation is built on 2D finite-difference grid. Such a grid-based simulation can bring approximation error in the RL. How did the authors avoid that? Additionally, there is no heat transferred between floors. Is this assumption realistic? There should be heat transferred between floors typically. How to justify these conditions or assumptions in the simulation model?\n\n3. No baseline comparison in the experimental results. The authors did really mention some existing methods. But there is no baseline comparison in the work such that we have no idea whether the proposed method has superiority over them.\n\n4. Only one pilot building is not sufficient to validate the scheme. Also, as indicated in the title, the authors mentioned energy and emission. But the results are based on temperature, what is the connection? I didn't see the optimization in terms of energy and emissions. \n\n5. The main contents should be self-explained. The authors should present sufficient technical detail to make sure it is clear to readers.\n\n6. The authors need typo check to improve the writing.\n\nOverall, this paper is not technically solid and sound."
