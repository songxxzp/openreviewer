                "value": "The paper presents a solution to address the challenges of one-class anomaly detection and the outlier-exposure scenario, where labeled anomalies are scarce in the training dataset. The authors introduce a method that incorporates a memory module, employing Hopfield layers, which is integrated with contrastive learning techniques. The approach allows for the memorization of multi-scale normal class prototypes during training, but also facilitates the learning of informative representations. This innovation significantly enhances the model's ability to capture subtle features of normal data while adapting to varying levels of anomaly complexity."

                "value": "The paper demonstrates several areas where it could be improved. \n\n1. While the authors assert that their model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a wide range of anomalies, it is notable that the paper lacks evaluation on widely-accepted benchmark datasets such as MVTec [1] and VisA [2]. These datasets contain texture anomalies, which are crucial for a comprehensive evaluation. Although CIFAR-10/100 and CUB are important, their evaluation should be complemented by assessments on these texture-oriented datasets.\n\n2. The paper mentions superior performance over existing methods, but Table 2 reveals that AnoMem, at best, achieves comparable results in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. It's important to ensure that the claims made align with the empirical findings.\n\n3. While it may be justifiable not to compare with state-of-the-art pretrained approaches like [3], given their exposure to external datasets, it remains important to include these comparisons in the evaluation. CIFAR and CUB datasets share similarities with ImageNet-pretrained data, but the FPAD dataset exhibits a significant distribution shift, which calls for a comparative analysis. Additionally, it's worth noting that AnoMem's performance benefits significantly from exposure to anomaly types, which pretrained methods do not rely on.\n\n4. Several crucial components of the proposed method are not examined by the authors. For example, while the authors briefly mention the potential substitution of the NTX objective with alternative contrastive frameworks like Barlow-Twins, which are known for their efficiency and ability to operate effectively with smaller batch sizes, this proposition lacks empirical demonstration. The absence of a comparative analysis or experimental results to support this claim leaves a gap in the evaluation of the method's adaptability and robustness across different contrastive learning frameworks. \n\n[1] MVTec AD \u2014 A Comprehensive Real-World Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection, Bergmann et. al, CVPR 2019.\n\n[2] SPot-the-Difference Self-Supervised Pre-training for Anomaly Detection and Segmentation, Zou et. al, ECCV 2022.\n\n[3] Mean-shifted contrastive loss for anomaly detection, Reiss & Hoshen, AAAI 2023."

The explanation of the linear evaluation protocol, while briefly described, lacks depth. It would be valuable to have a more detailed elaboration on the rationale behind employing this protocol and why it is considered an important metric in the context of anomaly detection. Moreover, given that this protocol may not be standard within the AD community, it raises curiosity about how other existing methods perform under this evaluation criterion. Could the authors shed light on the performance of competing methods using this protocol for comparison and context? This information would further enrich the assessment of the proposed approach."

                "value": "- It is unclear how much difference it makes by bringing multi-scale learning into the memory learning-based anomaly detection approaches. No appropriate ablation study or empirical comparison is presented there. The baseline in table 4 may be changed to a memory learning method that involves multiple normal prototypes to serve this purpose.\n- As demonstrated in table 4, the multi-scale learning has very limited contribution to the overall detection performance.\n- It mentions at page 4 about the issue of overfitting in existing methods that use a pre-trained encoder on large-scale image datasets, but this issue should be easily fixed by tuning on the target normal data. I cannot find convincing reasons for not using such well pre-trained encoders, and not comparing with such methods. Additionally, in this work, there is the extensive fitting of the multi-scale memory units to the limited normal data in the target data, which could easily lead to overfitting to the normal data, and so the proposed method could perform poorly on datasets with distribution shift. I wonder whether the authors could perform experiments on datasets with distribution shift to justify their argument.\n- The clarity is bad in several aspects. **1)** The memory learning in eqs. 2-4 involves ground truth $y_k$ that could be either $0$ for anomaly or $1$ for normal sample, but in sec. 3.2 there is a one-class AD objective, i.e., eq. 6, where no training anomaly examples are supposed to be available, so I'm confused that how the one-class AD model can be trained together with eqs. 2-4. **2)** The concept of outlier exposure (OE) is defined and used in OOD detection for using external datasets as pseudo OOD examples to train OOD detection models, but in this work it seems it treats real anomaly examples as OE examples. This is very confusing. Rather than using the so-called AD-OE concept, it may be clearer to use semi-supervised AD or open-set AD as in *\"Deep semi-supervised anomaly detection. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.02694.\"*, *\"Catching both gray and black swans: Open-set supervised anomaly detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 7388-7398).\"*, or *\"Ubnormal: New benchmark for supervised open-set video anomaly detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 20143-20153).\"* **3)** It is also unclear why we need a method that works well for both anomaly detection and OOD detection, given the fact that the two tasks have quite different application settings.\n- Following up the above point, since anomaly examples are used in the training stage, recent SOTA semi-supervised/open-set anomaly detection methods should be used in the experiment comparison to justify the advantages the work has, e.g., see *\"Catching both gray and black swans: Open-set supervised anomaly detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 7388-7398).\"* for some of such methods.\n- Experiments on large-scale high-resolution image datasets, e.g., the popular setting that uses ImageNet-1k as the ID dataset, are missing for the OOD detection task."
