While the approach is general, the authors focus on the mitigation of demographic biases here, such as gender, racial, or age-related biases in generated depictions of different occupation types or sports activities. \n\nThe method consists of a supervised fine-tuning step for different model components, which minimizes (in addition to two regularization losses that aim to preserve image quality) a loss that penalizes deviations in the demographic distribution of the generated images from a prescribed target demographic distribution. \n\nThe authors demonstrate experimentally that naive autodifferentiation-based gradient descent on this loss fails to achieve successful optimization; they provide a theoretical explanation, backed by empirical experiments, for this behavior. They then proceed to propose a simple gradient adjustment mechanism that mitigates this problem and enables successful optimization of the proposed loss function. \n\nFinally, the authors perform extensive experiments (using Stable Diffusion as an example), an ablation study, and comparisons with previously proposed debiasing mechanisms. Throughout all experiments, the proposed method is highly successful in mitigating demographic biases for unseen prompts, especially also in regards to intersectional biases."

                "value": "### Questions\n- CLIP is not without its own issues; see e.g. Shtedritski et al., Wang et al., Wolfe et al., or Zhang and R\u00e9. Could the authors discuss how this might affect the efficacy of their proposed method?\n- How do the authors implement using different lambda values for different regions of the same image, as they describe at the end of section 4.1? (\"We use a smaller weight for the non-face region ... and the smallest weight for the face region.\") L_img is per image, not per pixel, no?\n- I was confused about the training of the gender and race classifiers for the evaluation. Were separate classifiers trained for the training and the evaluation stage? If yes, why? Or is this maybe some kind of unintended text duplication? (\"The gender and race classifiers used for the evaluation loss are trained on the CelebA and FairFace datasets. ... Evaluation. We train new gender and race classifiers using CelebA and FairFace.\")\n- It was unclear to me which of (soft prompt, text encoder, U-Net) were actually finetuned for all of the main experiments in section 5.1?\n- Can the authors think of (and comment on) any drawbacks of applying their method at scale and for many fairness-relevant properties simultaneously? Could there be any negative consequences (e.g., in terms of image quality or biases) when e.g. generating very different images (bears, tables, groups of people, ... )? Recent observations by Qi et al. could also be interesting to discuss in this regard.\n\n### Suggestions for improvement\n- The optimal transport approach in Eq. (4) was a bit confusing to me at first because it differs from the usual setting in which the optimal transport scheme between two *distributions* is considered. By contrast, the authors consider an expectation over the optimal transport schemes between two *vectors* here. I believe everything is actually described correctly, but maybe there is a way to make this section even easier / more intuitive for readers to grasp? (Sorry, possibly not very helpful.)\n- It is a little bit confusing that y denotes both the generated target labels (normal font) as well as the images generated by the frozen model (boldface). \n- What does it mean that CLIP-ViT-bigG-14 and DINOv2 vit-g/14 are \"more performative than the ones used in training\"?\n- The authors might want to consider citing Lester et al. regarding soft prompt tuning?\n\n### References\n- Lester et al., The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning,  https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08691\n- Qi et al., Fine-tuning Aligned Language Models Compromises Safety, Even When Users Do Not Intend To!, https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03693\n- Shtedritski et al., What does CLIP know about a red circle?
