                "value": "This paper presents a theoretical framework aimed at investigating the discrepancy or 'misspecification' between the assumed and actual behavioural models during the Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) process. Moreover, it explores how this misspecification impacts the reward obtained through the IRL algorithm.\n\nThis research primarily concentrates on the most prevalent behavioural models, namely optimality, Boltzmann-rationality, and causal entropy maximisation.\n\nIn the initial segment of the theoretical framework, it introduces a formal definition of 'misspecification robustness' and the 'STARC-metric'. This metric is used to measure the differences between a reward function that remains invariant to potential shaping, redistribution, and possibly rescaling. Leveraging these definitions, the paper outlines the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying the degree of robustness against misspecification between two behavioural models.\n\nThe second segment of the theoretical framework presumes a distance between the returns of behavioural models (policies). It examines the capability of the IRL algorithm to learn precise rewards under two conditions: 1) when the behavioural models are misspecified, and 2) when there is a gap in their returns. The findings suggest that no continuous behavioural model can maintain robustness against these two levels of misspecification.\n\nIn the final part of the theoretical framework, the paper delves into the scenarios where the parameters of behavioural models are misspecified. The research primarily focuses on the discount parameter, demonstrating that behavioural models are, in principle, highly sensitive to even minor misspecifications of two of their core parameters."

To achieve this, IRL needs to make an assumption on the underlying behavior model, which maps reward functions to policies and characterizes the relation between $R$ and $\\pi$. However, the behavior model could be misspecified and differs from the true one. This paper is to contribute towards a theoretical understanding on the robustness of IRL to misspecification. First, this paper characterizes the sufficient and necessary condition to ensure that IRL is robust to a general misspecification. Then this paper considers a specific type of misspecification: the behavior model is a perturbation of the true one, and provides the corresponding sufficient and necessary condition. Finally, this paper considers another type of misspecification on the parameters of behavior models and provides a negative result that IRL is often not robust to such misspecification."
