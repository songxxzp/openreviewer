Spatial knowledge represents the topological conformity, whereas the temporal knowledge accounts for the sequencing constraints. The paper does not deal with assembly mistakes occurring due to orientation or fastening, and also leaves out the perception problems that need to be addressed for this task. The method uses synthetic dataset to determine the efficacy of their pre-conditions with respect to the state of the art method Sohn et al. The mistake detection of this proposed approach is evaluated on the annotated toy assembly dataset - Assembly 101."

                "value": "Trivial task definition: Examining only the errors related to the ordering in assembling tasks using the ground truth annotated object names and action verbs seems trivial, unless the issues related to orientation or fastening and the uncertainties in the object detection, shape, size or pose estimation are taken into consideration. \nPerception is ignored : Perception is an essential component of this problem statement. The real-life applicability and deployment seems impractical, unless the method is evaluated properly with a perception module that addresses object detection, shape & pose estimation etc. The results shown in the paper using the TSM perception to predict only the action verbs - attach or detach, shows a drop in recall by 35.9% and precision by 16.1%, highlighting the significance of perception for this problem.\nLimitations in the approach : The proposed approach is based on pure logic, set theory and graph representation of the spatial and the temporal relations. The entire pipeline relies on hard-coded logic and does not employ any learning mechanisms, leading to re-initialisation and re-population of the spatial and temporal knowledge, along with the preconditions, each time this method needs to assess a new object assembly. On top of that further improvements in this deterministic pipeline needs to be manually accounted for, hence inclusion of this paper is of little importance to the learning community.  \nLimited evaluation : The Assembly 101 dataset has only 328 distinct action sequences to construct 101 different toys and out of this only 1 randomly selected sequence is used for testing for each toy and remaining are used to create the spatial & temporal knowledge and the preconditions. The complexity of sequence in assembling a toy is not an apt illustration of the difficulty in assembling an object with numerous parts, involving a large complex sequence, say an electronic gadget, automobile etc. In addition, this dataset is too small in size to effectively represent all the possible scenarios of ordering mistakes that occur in real-life large scale assembly, for example a factory. The criteria of the logic module appears to be tailor made for the toy assembly dataset. Therefore, its performance in a different assembly scenario, with more parts and complex sequences needs to be sufficiently evaluated to establish the generalizability.\nLimitations in the logic : In Tab. 1, the proposed method shows a significant improvement over Sohn et al. (2020), but that is likely because of the inclusion of an additional case (intransitive temporal error) in the logic module. Yet, the proposed approach is unable to achieve 100% accuracy, precision or recall, clearly showing gaps in their logic module to determine all the possible cases of preconditions. Similarly in Tab. 2,  the proposed approach performs better than the existing methods, but I am unable to contemplate a reason for its failure to achieve perfect accuracy and F1, except the possibility of missing out on certain scenarios in its logic criterion, despite being a hard coded algorithm.\nMinor Weaknesses : \nClumsy Notations : Too many redundant symbols and equations appear in the paper whose purpose could have been simply stated in words.\nClarity in Fig 3 : Edges for both transitive and intransitive graphs have the same color. Especially in the intransitive graph, the \u201cfinal mistake\u201d edge could have been highlighted differently.\nClarity in Fig 5 : Please state the numerical identity of the assembly parts clearly to make the figure more intelligible"

A real-time video demonstration showing the ordering mistake detection in the assembly task, using only the RGB frame, would be very intriguing. \nIs it not possible to create and evaluate this method and SOTA on a larger dataset with different objects, more complex sequences and more parts? If so, what are the difficulties? A larger dataset would alleviate the concerns of generalizability.\nIf perception is included in this pipeline and you are able to estimate the object pose, how difficult would it be to extend this method to detect orientation errors?"

Moreover, if the part-to-part annotations and the synthetic dataset are treated as contributions, then more information should be included in the main paper, rather than the supplementary material. Please add a couple examples of the synthetic sequences with mistakes.\n\n- In my understanding, the BeliefBuilder is creating an explicit rule graph that only applies to a specific object and its set of components. Aren't explicit knowledge grounded beliefs very limited in terms of generalization? Wouldn't it be more useful to learn a soft graph with latent representations that could potentially be applied to new objects?"
