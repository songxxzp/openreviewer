This operation allows them to compare the spans of the two matrices using an overlap Grassmannian metric. With the proposed method, the authors observe an above random overlap between the pruning mask and the hessian eigenspace, which is large initially and stabilizes during training.

The authors do not take into account the effect of different pruning criteria on the overlap similarity. I believe the pruning criteria itself might have an important role to play in determining the amount of overlap between the hessian eigenspace and the pruning masks. For example, are there above random overlaps for random pruning or using a iterative pruning using the SNIP criterion [1]. Such an experiment would also shed more light on the significance of the overlap.\n\n2. The authors only show empirical results on the MNIST datasets which I think is insufficient. In order to confirm the presence of such an overlap, the authors must consider multiple datasets. If the computation of the eigenvectors of the Hessian is computationally problematic for larger image datasets, they can consider smaller tabular/algorithmic datasets.\n\n3. At high sparsities, the overlap is not significant (Fig. 4 has lower overlap than the random baseline for pruning ratio < 0.2). The authors have not addressed this sufficiently in the paper.\n\n4. The authors claim that the overlap between the masks and hessian eigenspaces suggests that large weights correspond to large curvatures in the loss. But this claim is not verified. For example, for a pruning criteria that retains the smallest weights instead of the largest, does the overlap still hold. Is the overlap affected by a SAM [2] like regularizer? Such ablations would be essential to verify the connection between weight magnitude and loss landscapes. Moreover, for homogenous activations, parameters can be arbitrarily scaled without changing the function but only modifying the loss curvature. This can also potentially change the behaviour of magnitude pruning and hence the overlap.\n\n\n[1] Lee, Namhoon, Thalaiyasingam Ajanthan, and Philip Torr. \"SNIP: SINGLE-SHOT NETWORK PRUNING BASED ON CONNECTION SENSITIVITY.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2018.\n\n[2] Foret, Pierre, et al. \"Sharpness-aware Minimization for Efficiently Improving Generalization.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2020."

The distances proposed are not new but rather are various distances considered for the Grassmannian or manifold of $k$-dimensional linear subspaces.  Additional consideration is given to the fact that pruning masks occupy a subset of Grassmannian with the additional restriction that the subsapce be axis-aligned. Each metric is studied for randomly drawn matrices under two setups: (1) the overall dimension $D$ is fixed and the ratio of the subspace dimension $k$ to $D$ is varied and (2) the ratio $k/D$ is held constant and $D$ is increased.\n\nThe experiments with random matrices show that these metrics appear to converge as $D$ increases and can be sub-divided into \"shrinking\" metrics that go to 0 with increasing $D$ and \"proportional\" metrics which converge to a non-zero value.  In the setting of these experiments, the value the \"proportional\" metric converges to is determined by the ratio $k/D$.\n\nBased on these experiments, the authors argue for using the overlap metric to compare pruning masks and top $k$ Hessian subspaces and use the value these metrics converge to with increasing $D$ as a baseline for how close we should expect random subspaces to be.  Overall, I thought the steps taken in this first part of the paper were reasonable."

                "value": "(a) My primary concern about the paper is that while its claims about comparing subspaces are primarily empirical, results are only only shown for a small MLP (7030 parameters) on subsampled 16 x 16 MNIST.  The lottery ticket literature in particular shows that there are significant changes in behavior for large scale problems. [1], for example, shows that for larger problems (e.g. ResNet-50 on ImageNet) lottery tickets have to be found after a small amount of dense training rather than at random initialization.  Thus, my view is that supporting the paper's claims requires larger-scale experiments.\n\nNote that I understand that the justification for the set up used is that computing the Hessian eigenspectra for larger networks is expensive. However, there are now a number of software tools aimed at studying the Hessian in large-scale networks; see for example PyHessian [2].  Also, I think just studying the overlap in the early parts of training would be sufficient.\n\n(b) Next, I think the paper requires some clarification about the pruning mask that is being used in the experiment.  My understanding is at each step, the mask under consideration is some percentage of the largest magnitude weights in the current model. ($\\rho$ is defined to be the ratio of unpruned parameters so does $\\rho =0.2$ mean 80% of the weights are pruned?) This means that fundamentally the experiments compare how close the subspace of the $k$ highest magnitude weights is to the $k$ sharpest directions of the Hessian at each training iteration. Is this correct?\n\nTo make the comparison to the lottery ticket literature, the paper first needs a definition of how to determine whether a mask is a lottery ticket or not.  A standard definition would be that a mask is a lottery ticket if the associated subnetwork at initialization (or a few steps into dense training) is trainable to the same accuracy as the dense network.  Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) typically uses a masks constructed at the end of training, so I think it is important to confirm the masks under consideration meet this definition by including the accuracy achieved when retraining the sparse network (or whatever metric would confirm this is a lottery ticket in your definition).  Note this could be done for a subset of the training steps; the general trend over training is what is important. *If these masks do not achieve a reasonable accuracy when retrained then these experiments do not tell us much about lottery tickets.*\n\n\n(c) I found the applications the authors discussed beyond understanding the two phenomena to be unclear.  For example:\n\n```\nSince pruning masks can be obtained in linear time, our results suggest new ways for fast and effective low-rank Hessian approximations, with application to e.g. pruning and optimization methods as proposed by Hassibi et al.\n```\n\nCould the authors expand on this, i.e. give basic pseudocode for their idea?  Second, how could these results lead to \"novel pruning algorithms\" as described in the conclusion?\n\nMinor Notes:\n* Bottom of page 3: Reference to Pearlmutter (1994) should probably use citep rather than citet.\n* Bottom of page 4: $\\mathbb{B}^{D \\times k}$ is never explicitly defined.  In addition to being binary, I think you need the criteria that there is only one non-zero per column.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Jonathan Frankle, Gintare Karolina Dziugaite, Daniel Roy, Michael Carbin.  \"Linear Mode Connectivity and the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis.\" https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/frankle20a\n\n[2] Zhewei Yao, Amir Gholami, Kurt Keutzer, Michael Mahoney. \"PyHessian: Neural Networks Through the Lens of the Hessian.\" https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07145"
