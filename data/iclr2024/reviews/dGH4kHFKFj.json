Still, the technique is not well explained in detail, and the notation is often confusing. For example, the letter \"g\" is used both for the shape generator and for the mesh generator, and requires some back-and-forth to get used to it. I suggest revisiting the method explanation and clarifying the methodological details.\n- By my understanding, the method highly relies on the target shapes belonging to a given distribution that should not only bounded in terms of structure and class but in particular, should be possible to express by the registered template. Many methods rely on template registration, and it is not a weakness per se, but the proposed approach makes use of techniques that aim to be general and flexible (e.g., implicit representation, unsupervised learning), but the paper does not show any out-of-distribution results (and also, results only on shapes for which data are available and can be even generated synthetically). I also believe that the topological constraint given by the template limits the generality of the method. The limitations barely mention this, and it should be emphasized more.\n- Experiments are performed on a relatively small set of data. The datasets are outdated and do not deal with the literature's more recent and real challenges (e.g., partiality, noise, clutter, ...). In this sense, I suggest stressing the method further; I believe that they would be interesting to investigate the latent interpolation when the learned space represents more diverse shapes (i.e., I wonder if relying on implicit representation may help in the context of limited topological variation during the interpolation, or if the relying on a template do not let to generalize to these cases)"

I think would be important to understand the scalability of the method, and I assume that the method would require a significant computational effort. How does it compare with NeuroMorph?\n3) Would it be possible to test the method on a class for which a dense correspondence is not provided; for example, some classes of ShapeNet (e.g., cars, airplanes)?"

It is based on fitting the input shapes with a mesh generator that is constrained to preserve the local structure (conformal or isometric) of the shapes. Particularly, GenCorres first learns an implicit generator from the input shapes using a VA, which produces intermediate shapes between arbitrary pairs. The paper introduces a novel approach for computing correspondences between adjacent implicit surfaces, which is used to regularize the implicit generator. Second, synthetic shapes generated by the implicit generator guide the initial fittings (template-based deformations) for learning the mesh generator. Experimental results demonstrate that GenCorres outperforms state-of-the-art JSM techniques in collections of articulated body shapes."

Stage 1 learns an implicit generator from unorganized sets using a VAE, where local (ACAP) and cycle consistency is imposed between surfaces that are close along the embedding dimension, defining the geometric deformation and cycle-consistency regularization losses. Stage 2 learns the explicit mesh generator from the VAE encoder-decoder. Stage 3 refines and fits the mesh generator to the input set of meshes and enforces again local structure consistency with ACAP. The three stages are well constructed and contain novel contributions to this field, especially the regularization losses in Stage 1. The results in the paper reveal that the GenCorres' generative method produces high-quality meshes and the correspondences across the input set significantly improve the state-of-the-art.\nIn terms of the quality, the methodology is well described and motivated. The results offer enough evidence that GenCorres improves the state-of-the-art of JSM in collections of shapes describing articulated body shapes.
