Estimating the Lipschitz constant is useful for evaluating the robustness and generalizability of neural networks. Existing methods are either not tight enough or do not scale well to large CNNs. The core idea of DCP is to decompose a large CNN into smaller subnetworks using a joint layer and width-wise partition. The Lipschitz constant of the original network can then be bounded by the Lipschitz constants of the smaller networks. Experiments demonstrate improved scalability over baseline methods. Key factors affecting the accuracy vs scalability tradeoff are also analyzed, including the number and order of subnetworks and the choice of partition sizes."

Furthermore, to improve the scalability, the authors rely on the bounds of Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), which are known to be very loose. \n- The authors seem to have missed an important related work [1], which proposes a Lipschitz estimation for the CNN that is independent of the image size and only dependent on the channel size. \n- The experiments are performed\n\t- on random weights and not on trained networks: \"All network weights were generated according to the Kaiming distribution\".\n\t- on very small input sizes, more than twice smaller than MNIST: \"[...] by constructing a convolutional block with an input size of 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 1 [...]\". I understand that the authors want to evaluate their approach with different channel sizes: \"We increased the width by varying c from 1 to 14\", but an image size of 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 1 is too small to demonstrate scalability. \n\n[1] Gramlich et al.

(10). If $ \\ell \\times k > m_0, n_0$ where $k$ is the size of the kernel of these convolutions, then all $f_{i,j}$ should have domain $X^0$.  \nIt seems that this inaccuracy is repeated in the entire paper (e.g. in 4.1.2 Eq. (14)). However this idea may be exploited in order to better constraint the search space for the partitions.\n\nI think a discussion should precise these concerns. And what is the impact of the potential overlap between the layers on the computation time.\n\n**Experiments**\n\nAll neural networks considered have weights initialized with the Kaiming distribution, that aim at having gradients of magnitude O(1). We are in a regime that is most likely very different from a trained neural network. Overall I think the paper would be seriously improved if the author were to reproduce the experiments of Lip-SDP and benchmark them with the proposed DCP approach.\n\nFigure 2 (c) provides an interesting illustration of the tradeoff between computation time and the given upper-bound. This behaviour is intuitively expected from Eq (18) and I am surprised that a 5-fold time reduction only decrease the upper-bound by 20%. It would be very interesting to see if the proposed approach could tackle much bigger neural networks where vanilla Lip-SDP would fail.  \nI wonder if these curves could be derived analytically directly from Eq 18 with the assumptions than the weights follow Kaiming.\n\nThe only property of CNNs that this paper exploits is that their matrix representation may be sparse under appropriate assumptions. Can this work be generalized to a broader class of neural networks?"
