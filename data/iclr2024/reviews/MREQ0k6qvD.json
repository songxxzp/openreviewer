They note that existing methods often lack biological plausibility, primarily because they don't account for the influence of anatomical structures on functional neural interactions. To rectify this, the authors introduce a one-hot prior to the GLM model. The method was evaluated on one synthesized dataset and two real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results."

Drawing insights from neuroscience, the authors convincingly argue that anatomical structures influence dynamic functional neural interactions. Their approach to address this hypothesis is adeptly framed, straightforward, and effective. The evaluation is comprehensive, encompassing a broad spectrum of models related to the problem, and it's tested across varied datasets. The inclusion of the whisking dataset is particularly intriguing, and the visual illustrations enhance clarity. Overall, this paper is commendable and would be a valuable contribution to the ICML community, showcasing the intersections of machine learning and neuroscience research."

Does incorporating an increasing number of biological constraints into models always lead to better outcomes? Or are there potential trade-offs to be mindful of? Going forward, are the authors considering other factors that might influence interactions? For instance, within an E-I balanced network, given identical anatomical structures and brain states, interactions could vary based on the stage and phase of short-term synaptic depression. This suggests that intrinsic governing features could arise when adding more biological constraints or features. I'd appreciate the authors' perspective on this."

The latter goes beyond previous work with a specific factorization that involves a mixture factor over at the simplex, which at its extremes provides a one-hot encoding that determines the existence of a connection and its sign (excitatory or inhibitory), and the state-dependent weight magnitude. Estimation of the parameters of this model requires an expectation maximization algorithm, which is briefly described. Baseline models from the literature and additional novel baselines are constructed by involving various aspects of the proposed approach. Results are presented for a synthetic experiment and two real-world data sets, with known task/stimulus/environmental timing."

It is not clear to me how well it will work if the neurons are organized into groups with their own state dynamics (which evolve largely independently) and only rarely communicate. I.e. the topology of the network could be loose connections between tightly interconnected subnetworks. \n\nA principled approach for the selection of the number of states is not discussed. At one point the paper mentions that the log-likelihood is higher with additional states although these states are rare: \"there are many sessions with rarely occupied states, and the distinction\nbetween states becomes subtle\". This seems to be a flaw in the modeling if someone does not know how many true states. Should the reader be suggested to look at the distribution of states to decide? Perhaps a model selection criterion is needed. \n\nAlong similar lines, an analysis of the decoding of task information from the latent state would help understand in the real-world tasks the utility of the state estimate. \n\nQuestions of scaling could provide better significance:\n\nHow scalable is the model and/or the algorithm? New recording technology including optical calcium imaging can record from hundreds to close to thousands of neurons.  The number of neurons in the synthetic study could be ramped up to see this. \n\nIt is not clear how quickly can inference be performed after model fitting.
