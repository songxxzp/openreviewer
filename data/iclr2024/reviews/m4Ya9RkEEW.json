This formulation motivates an \"accelerated sampling\" approach, in which they skip to the transition points instead of processing timesteps without token changes (although I'm not convinced this is done correctly). This allows them to use a finite number of generation steps for the continuous limit of infinite forward process steps. They find that their approach outperforms the \"reparameterized diffusion model\" (RDM) of Zheng et al. (2023) in terms of BLEU score for machine translation, and outperforms vanilla multinomial diffusion in terms of perplexity for text8 and enwiki8."

                "value": "**[S1]** The alternative formulation of the forward process for multinomial diffusion and absorbing-state diffusion is interesting. This formulation, presented in Section 2.2, takes advantage of the fact that the noising distribution of these two types of discrete diffusion models is independent of the current state, e.g. the token at time $x_{t}$ is either exactly the same as $x_{t-1}$ or it is an independent draw from a noise distribution. This means you can construct a non-Markov process with the same conditional marginal distribution $q(x_t | x_0)$ by just picking a random time at which the token is replaced with a random token $w$, and then setting $x_t$ to either $w$ or $x_0$.\n\n**[S2]** The proposed DNDM method seems to outperform RDM and vanilla multinomial diffusion for a fixed time budget, by skipping over wasted computation in RDM for large numbers of generation steps.\n\n**[S3]** The paper is clearly written and easy to follow."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "~~**[W1]**~~ *(addressed in revision)* I'm not convinced that the accelerated sampling algorithm that the authors propose is actually correct from a probabilistic standpoint. The authors motivate it by proving (in Theorem 3.1) that the transition times in the forward process are independent and follow a particular distribution based on the noise schedule. However, this is only proven for the *forward process*. In order for the proposed sampling algorithm to make sense, this property would have to also be true for the *reverse process*: it must be the case that, after conditioning on the current value of $x_t$, the transition times remain independent and have a tractable distribution.\n\nThis doesn't seem obvious to me. Note that the values of the tokens get noise added independently during the forward process when you condition on $x_0$, but are NOT independent when you condition on their values in $x_t$. This is why discrete diffusion methods are typically justified using a variational ELBO argument; approximating the tokens as independent creates a bias that must be corrected for through iterative refinement. The same might be true of the transition times.\n\n**[W2]** *(mostly addressed in revision)* Overall, the proposed algorithm seems to rely on intuition and heuristics for some parts, and some important technical details about the probabilistic model are glossed over.\n\n- ~~(a)~~ *(addressed in revision)* The paper refers to the predictive model of $p_\\theta(x_{t-1} | \\hat{x}_0, x_t)$ as a \"score network\". For continuous diffusion, the \"score\" refers to the gradient of the marginal density with respect to the input. I don't think this is quite correct in the discrete case. Prior work on discrete diffusion models mostly doesn't seem to use \"score network\" terminology, or else uses it to refer to a very specific generalization of the continuous score (e.g. [Meng et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00802))\n- ~~(b)~~ *(addressed in revision)* The assumptions being made about the \"score network\" are not clearly stated, although the paper later mentions \"the possibility that WMT14 violates our assumption that the pre-trained score model is uniformly accurate for all time steps\" in the experiments section. This seems important because the predictive model $p_\\theta(x\\_{t-1} | \\hat{x}\\_0, x\\_t)$ is never perfectly accurate. In particular, in the standard diffusion model setup $p\\_\\theta$ makes independent predictions for all tokens, whereas those tokens may have a nontrivial joint distribution. Additionally it is only trained using a variational bound, so it seems likely to me that it would not be \"uniformly accurate for all time steps\".\n- ~~(c)~~ *(addressed in revision)* Although the proposed DNDM model has an identical forward process, the corresponding approximate reverse process distribution isn't clearly explained; the authors instead jump straight to a sampling algorithm, and it's not obvious that optimizing the training objective will make this sampling algorithm match the forward process.\n- (d) The authors note that their reverse sampler decodes predictions using \"different decoding strategies including greedy decoding, top-k decoding and temperature decoding\" and mentions that argmax decoding shows strong performance. I don't think this makes sense under a probabilistic view of the process; this feels just like a heuristic to improve results. *Edit: There's apparently some precent for this, since the RDM model also uses heuristic decoding methods.*\n\n**[W3]** The authors motivate their approach based on accelerating generation speed, but I'm not convinced the gains are actually significant when compared to just using an autoregressive model. The authors seem to focus on accelerating sampling when there are more denoising steps than there are tokens (e.g. the 1000-step and $\\infty$-step conditions for WMT, the 1000-step and 4000-step conditions for unconditional generation). But if you have more denoising steps than tokens, it seems like you may as well just use an ordinary autoregressive model. Indeed, in the \"$\\infty$-step\" diffusion, the continuous-time reverse sampler requires one network evaluation per token generated, which is the same number of computation steps as an autoregressive model would use.\n\nI expect that an autoregressive model would have a better tradeoff between generation time and quality than the method proposed here.\n\n~~**[W4]**~~ *(addressed in revision)* The baselines for the experiments seem fairly limited. The authors only compare against RDM and vanilla multinomial diffusion models, but seem to introduce additional heuristics into the decoding process to get better results for a fixed compute budget. It seems to me then that it would be fairer to compare to the much larger set of non-autoregressive generative models, for which similar heuristics are considered fair game and for which many ideas have already been proposed and evaluated.\n\nAs one example, I believe Mask-Predict [(Ghazvininejad et al. 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09324) achieves higher BLEU scores on WMT14 (relative to this work) using only 10 model evaluations, by using argmax decoding and other heuristics. Many other examples are discussed in a survey by [Xiao et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09269).\n\n**[W5]** Unconditional generation samples (in the appendix) remain unimpressive relative to autoregressive model generation quality. This applies to previous work as well, of course, but I don't think the improvements in Table 3 translate to a noticeable increase in overall sample quality.\n\n**[W6]** The proposed approach only applies to discrete diffusion models that have the form in Equation (1), but this is only a subset of the discrete diffusion models that have been considered in the literature. Austin et al. (2021) discusses a few alternatives that are not of this form (e.g. discreteized Gaussian, token-embedding-distance transitions, or hybrids of absorbing and other diffusion processes as discussed in the appendix). Another recent example is Blackout Diffusion [(Santos et al. 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11089)."

Also, how does your method do with a more realistic number of sampling steps (smaller than the sequence length), and how does it compare to an autoregressive model with the same compute budget?\n\nI'm not sure what is meant by \"full de-randomization\". The transition times and the sampled tokens are still random, are they not?\n\nSection 2.2 mentions \"the chain rule\" but it's not obvious to me what this is referring to.

Sampling is then done by sampling the transition times for each token (along with the prior tokens), and iterating over each step that has any transitions occurring in it. Since for large step counts, there may be some time steps with no transitions occurring at all, the proposed method accelerates sampling by skipping over them. The paper further goes to present an infinite-step limit, where each token gets a different transition time, providing a maximum to the time required for sampling. The paper goes on to showcase that the method achieves competitive results in machine translation compared to another method for accelerating discrete diffusion sampling, and also provides clear improvements over standard discrete diffusion models in unconditional text generation on small-scale data sets."

While technically true from the diffusion perspective, this also overlooks the fact that the relevant metrics are actually the amount of function evaluations (or the time taken for sampling). Similarly, comparisons with the same step counts to RDM in Table 1 & 2 seem suboptimal to me, and instead it should be (approximately) the same amount of function evaluations / wall clock time. \n- It would also be good to elaborate where exactly does the method provide an improvement over RDM, since they focused more on step counts <25, whereas the comparisons here are for step counts >25. In this sense, is the model even a direct competitor for RDM, or could the two methods be combined?\n- I think the paper may require more work on clarifying what are the new contributions of the proposed model and designing the experiments such that they clearly showcase these contributions (see also questions on ARDM).

                "value": "- It seems to me that there are quite a bit of (potentially subtle) similarities with the previous work [1], where the authors note a connection between absorbing diffusion models and order-agnostic autoregressive models. In particular, as pointed out in their Appendix C, the continuous-time limit of an absorbing diffusion model is effectively equivalent to to their order-agnostic ARDM, which seems to be also equivalent to the infinite-time limit for absorbing diffusion presented in this paper. Would the authors of the submission agree, or maybe are there differences that I have overlooked? I do see that in the non-infinite-time case, the models do not exactly match, and the model is formulated from a different point of view, potentially allowing more flexibility in designing the generative process. But it would be good to give more elaboration on the differences to ARDM and maybe also provide direct numerical comparisons in the paper. \n- One downside of the paper as of now is that a method to estimate the data likelihood is not included. Perhaps it would be possible to create a lower bound by not having having intermediate latents $x_t$ at all, and considering the transition times $\\tau$ as latent variables? For instance, setting the inference distribution to $q(\\tau^{1:D}) \\prod_k^D q(x_T^k | x_0^k)$, where $\\tau^k$ is distributed according to Uniform({1,\u2026,T}), and the corresponding generative process defined such that we first sample from the priors $p(x_T)$ and $p(\\tau)$, and then generate the different dimensions according to the ordering of $\\tau$. If I am not mistaken, this would be similar to what was done in the ARDM paper as well, and one could form an ELBO similar to theirs.\n- How is the evaluation with the BERT model done for the unconditional generation experiments, exactly?\n\nOverall, I think the idea is good, but if I am not mistaken on the points regarding novelty compared to ARDM, the paper requires more work on finding and clearly presenting the unique angle in which the new discrete diffusion formulation contributes to the community.

                "value": "Very interesting work. Assuming a diffusion process to exists several transition times ---when the process will be still after that time. Using this nice property can achieve acceleration of sampling steps. The authors study both the discrete process and the continuous process. The authors first point out that for each process there is a transition time. Then they prove that transition time are independently spread and follows a certain analytic density. Following this density, the authors design algorithms to jump at each transition time to achieve acceleration of diffusion sampling. Their method demonstrates efficiency in several scenarios using small NFEs."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "This paper is not complete. First of all, it lacks ablation studies to demonstrate the influence of distributions of the transition time. With respect, I do not agree with that, all instances of transition times are equal in effect.\n\nFollowing up on the above point, why not the author study which instantiation of the transition time is the best for sampling, in the sense of quality and speed? Stopping at the distribution stage is not a good thought, I believe.\n\nAnother thing is the visualization of transition times, the x_t at those times, and other related values. Letting me see that x_t gets still after the transition time will make me more convinced of your method and creativity.\n\nApart from that, the authors did not implement this work in image generation. I guess they may have a good reason for that, as diffusion is the dominating and most influential method in image generation. A method to improve diffusion sampling but not implemented on the image is strange. Are there anything barriers to the method to apply in images?\n\nAlso, I believe the authors also agree with, the proposed method does not outperform competitors in all shown cases. Sometimes the improvements are marginal. \n\nAs a theoretical work, I appreciate the idea a lot, but the theoretical analysis is not that deep so I can safely vote for acceptance with no objection from the other reviewers and the AC. Deeper theoretical analysis related to sampling NFEs, approximation error with the original process, and techniques to further improve it could be much more appreciated.\n\nI am not an expert in the language generation domain, if I have any mistakes, do please correct me.\n\nThe major problem of this paper to me, is the lack of enough empirical analysis, and results on image domains."
