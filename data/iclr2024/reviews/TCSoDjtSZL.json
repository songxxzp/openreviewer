The key insight of the approach is that 3D prior is helpful for generating consistent structures while 2D prior can improve details. Thus, an annealing strategy and CLIP-based switching mechanism are designed to blend the two phases together. Consistent123 is validated on the public available RealFusion15 and a customized C10 dataset."

To optimize novel views, it uses a two-stage case-aware optimization process. Stage 1 optimizes NeRF with only a 3D prior, i.e., the SDS loss of Zero 1-to-3 (Liu et al., 2023). An adaptive detection mechanism determines when to transition to Stage 2. Stage 2, like Magic123, brings in a 2D prior (the SDS of Stable Diffusion) for texture details, but with scheduling of the 3D-2D ratio over time. Evaluated on RealFusion15 (15 images) and a self-collected C10 dataset (100 images from 10 categories), Consistent123 seems to produce better results than Magic123."

This work basically finetunes the trader-off process with stage split and scheduling. It is not technically novel. \n2. Insufficient quantitative evaluation. No 3D evaluation is performed to show the overall structural quality. The paper could have rendered some synthetic and scanned 3D meshes for evaluation. PSNR and LPIPS only reflect how much the input/reference view is overfitted in the NeRF. For example, RealFusion cannot generate reasonable geometry but beats Magic123 by a large margin in these two metrics according to Table 1. \n3. Lack of comparisons to some related work. Shap-E (Jun et al., 2023) and One-2-3-45 (Liu et al., 2023) are two SOTA papers in image-to-3D, released earlier than Magic123. However, they are not cited and compared in this paper.\n4. Additional prior, unfair comparison: It also needs text prompts as inputs. The paper does not specify how text prompts are prepared for the experiments. But, according to Figure 3., \u201ctwo donuts\u201d as the text prompt is pretty specific and introduces important additional prior for the optimization. It leads to unfair comparisons with other methods.\n5. Potentially increased time cost. The paper does not report the expected time cost for the optimization.\n6. The pipeline is engineered to favor 3D prior at the beginning. It may bring some improvements on cherry-picked examples but might deteriorate in other cases."

Sec. 3.1 follows Make-it-3D and Magic123 to add the normalized negative Pearson correlation depth loss in addition to the common color and mask losses. But the off-the-shelf depth estimator seems changed.\n\n    b. Sec. 3.2 uses the loss of 3D prior (Eq. 4) proposed in Stable DreamFusion\u2019s implementation of Zero 1-to-3. Later, it is adopted in Magic123.\n\n    c. Sec. 3.3 uses the loss of 2D prior (Eq. 7) from DreamFusion. The combined loss (Eq. 8) is following Magic123 but change the coefficient to a timestep-based one.\n2. In the explanation of 3D prior (Eq. 4), the authors wrote that \u201c*R* and *T* mean the positional coordinate parameters of the camera.\u201d This is an unprofessional mistake. *R* determines the orientation of the camera, but not the location. \n3. Sec 1. Introduction: In fact, Magic123 cannot \u201cavoid the multi-face issues.\u201d There are even some multi-face shapes on its webpage, such as the multi-head dragon and the multi-beak bird.\n4.

If the methods can handle the cases, could you give some analysis or other evaluation to support them? Otherwise, please make the limitation more clear and show some failure cases, which are more important for the reader and the future direction of the field.\n- For equation 3, how to determine the weight of the different losses. The L_depth is not defined if the proposed methods use the depth as the supervision, please explain how to obtain the accurate depth.\n- For section 3.3, the name \u2018dynamic prior\u2019 is very confusing, I suggest changing it to the \u2018adaptive\u2019 prior since equation 8 passes the \u2018adaptive\u2019 meaning. For the novel point, I am very curious about the weight changes during the optimization, if there is a visualization, it will be better to understand section 3.3. BTW, what about the difference from the Magic123 for this point? It is very important if the rebuttal provides the explanations.\n- What about the running times for generation one 3D shape for stage 1 and stage 2?\n- For the ablation studies, depth supervision is also needed to evaluate, as well as the different weight combinations.\n- In the experiments, more datasets should be also evaluated, such as NeRF4(proposed in Magic123) and Objaverse(https://objaverse.allenai.org/). Just evaluating on two datasets is weak for the strong 3D generation methods."

                "value": "see weakness\n\nOverall, the paper proposed a novel framework to achieve consistent 3D shape generation with a two-stage optimization strategy. And the evaluation and validation are given more evidence to support the superiority of the proposed methods. However, there are still some unclear issues, weak novelty, and insufficient evaluations (list them as weaknesses). According to these issues, the major concern is the weak novelty (the dynamic prior is very similar to the Magic123), so I lean toward a borderline score for the submission and am looking forward to the response to the above question."
