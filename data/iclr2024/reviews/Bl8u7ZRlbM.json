The data is derived from anonymous user chat transcripts on HuggingFace, where the authors strategically deployed free chatbots in exchange for access to these interaction logs. The biggest advantange of the WildChat dataset is its significant volume of toxic content. This can greatly aid the community in analyzing toxic behavior and subsequently implementing robust models to detect such harmful content. However, it's crucial to rigorously review the toxic content prior to its release."

The potential applications of the WildChat dataset appear to be restricted. While this paper has presented the dataset's utility for toxic content classification, the broader applications of this dataset remain unclear to me.\n3. I understand the challenges associated with releasing the full dataset during a double-blind review process.

The performance superiority is not the thing to worry. Such benchmark results can help you better assess the coverage and diversity of the released WILDCHAT dataset.\n\n2. I suggest that the authors should find a taxonomy for analyzing the task coverage, i.e. Flan, of the proposed WILDCHAT.

The paper incorporates lexical diversity as a component of the diversity of user prompts. However, whether lexical diversity alone is sufficient to reflect the diversity of user prompts. More specifically, if unigram entropy is used to calculate lexical diversity, does a scenario where each word in the user prompts is distinct necessarily indicate superior user prompts?\n3. Could the toxic rate observed on Detoxify be potentially attributed to the selection of 0.1 as the threshold? This relatively low threshold might lead to false positives. Furthermore, how do the other four datasets perform on Detoxify?\n4. Given that Llama-2 Chat has traded performance for alignment with humans through RLHF, one might expect its capabilities on STEM and Extraction (on MT-bench) to be somewhat diminished. Why, then, does WildLlama still fall short of Llama-2 Chat in these two areas?\n5. In Table 8, WILDLLAMA still inferior to Llama-2 Chat."
