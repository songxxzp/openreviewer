If the sole purpose is to consider the class-label structure, perhaps some proofs (e.g., the proof to Theorem 3) could be simplified.\n\nI do not fully understand the image data experiments depicted in Fig 3(a) and (b) in section 5.2, and I would appreciate it if the authors could provide further explanation. From my understanding, the goal here is to identify an optimal transport (OT) map between two data distributions (e.g., the distribution of MNIST and KMNIST images) while preserving the class correspondence. To achieve this, one could visualize several source images from the same class in the source dataset and check if the corresponding target images are from the same class. However, Fig 3 appears to display only a single source image per class (top rows) along with a target image per class (2nd rows), making it unclear whether the class correspondence is preserved overall. \n\nAnother reason why Figures 3(a) and 3(b) are challenging to understand is the absence of a natural correspondence between the classes of MNIST -> KMNIST and FMNIST -> MNIST images. It is thus difficult to check the correspondence visually. To enhance visualization, would it be reasonable to use only a single dataset, such as MNIST, and establish the correspondence of images from class 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 to a permuted class order, such as 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 0? This approach would help to visualize the class correspondence."

The proposed algorithm block is very similar, with the only difference that it is written for a class-guided functional.       \n\n2 - As I was reading the paper, I found the motivation, the theoretical discussion, and the numerical examples a bit disconnected. If the main contribution of the paper is the OT with general cost functional, it is necessary to provide several examples of a general cost functional, rather than just focusing on class guided cases. If the main goal of the paper is to do the class guided transportation, it should be reflected in the title, there should be more motivation why this is useful in practice, and what are the existing approaches for this particular problem. \n\n3 - The comparison with the existing OT approaches does not seem fair as they do not optimize the same cost function as your apporach. A possible comparison is to use the existing OT algorithms to do to transportation for each class separately, resulting in 10 different maps (for the MNIST case) and discuss how your proposed method, which only trains one map, is computationally more efficient, while the loss in accuracy is not significant.\n\n[1] Alexander Korotin, Daniil Selikhanovych, and Evgeny Burnaev.

This is called general cost OT, because classical OT is a special case, taking $F(\\pi) = \\int c(x, y) d\\pi$.\nThe authors derive a max-min reformulation for the approach as $\\sup_{v}\\inf_{\\pi\\in \\Pi(P)} F(\\Pi) - \\int v d\\pi(y) + \\int v dQ(y)$, and then propose to parametrize the coupling $\\pi$ as samples from $[x, T(x, z)]$ where $x\\sim P$ , $z$ are samples from a Latent distribution like a Gaussian, and $T$ is a map that can itself be parameterized by a neural net. The potential $v$ is also parameterized by a NN.\nIn cases where the functional $F$ has a nice structure, the above max-min formulation can be estimated from random samples of $P, Q$ and $z$. \n\nThe authors then provide an error analysis for the method where $F$ is strongly convex.\n\nThe main application of the method discussed in the paper is to do optimal transport that is faithful to labels. Given two mixtures $P = \\sum \\alpha_n P_n$ and $Q = \\sum \\beta_n Q_n$, the authors want to estimate a transport plan between P and Q that should also map, as well as possible, each $P_n$ to $Q_n$. The corresponding cost function, a sum of energy distances between $T\\\\#P_n$ and $Q_n$, fits nicely into the proposed general cost framework, as it can be estimated from samples using a (costly) U-statistics, and is different from classical OT costs.\n\nThe experiments are on toy MNIST, KMNIST and fashion MNIST datasets, where the authors try to match each class. They compute the corresponding FID between mapped source and target dataset, and accuracy on the mapped set of a resnet trained on the target set."
