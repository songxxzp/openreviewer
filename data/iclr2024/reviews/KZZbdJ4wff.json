Specifically, PRO employs a combination of a pseudo-label based surrogate loss and a standard surrogate loss, with a regularization parameter, to guide the model's adaptation. Experimental results on 18 datasets demonstrate that PRO enhances the accuracy of the ViT-B-32 model by an average of 2.5% and up to 6.1%, showcasing its practical utility in addressing this challenge."
