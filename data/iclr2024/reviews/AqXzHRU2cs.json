Said activities are then analyzed through a sequin sequential model that is based on sensor embeddings that utilize modeling approaches that are known from the domain of language analysis. The claimed innovation lies in the replacement of ELMO embeddings as they had have been used in previous work with GPT embeddings, and the introduction of contextual, hierarchical activity analysis. The experimental evaluation is based on standard benchmarks, i.e., the CASAS datasets and results are presented in form of balanced accuracies and comparisons are drawn to previous methods that were ELMO based, and a deeper dive into the effectiveness of hierarchical modeling is presented."

Activity recognition in such environments is inherently challenging due to the unconstrained environment, the noise, ambiguities in both sensor readings and annotations, and many other factors. As such, much progress still needs to be made and I applaud the authors for tackling such an important problem. The paper sets off from a relevant baseline and works with relevant benchmark datasets \u2014 as such the presented work in itself is relevant and has the potential to push beyond the state of the art."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Despite the general importance of the problem domain that this paper tackles, there are a number of weaknesses with this paper. First, the technical innovation is rather limited. The authors essentially replace one established sensor embedding (ELMO) with another one (GPT). Even the latter one has already been used in previous work (as cited by the authors \u2014 Takeda et al. 2023). The authors claim some additional technical improvement, namely the introduction of temporal context and hierarchical processing. While the former seems problematic because, in my opinion, in substantially limits the generalizability of the resulting models (I believe they are vey likely to overfit, which, alas has not been evaluated in detail), the latter seems interesting. The authors are right in stating that flat activity recognition has issues \u2014 especially when it comes to the analysis of concurrent activities. Yet, I am not convinced that the presented hierarchical approach would actually alleviate this problem in general as, for example, the incorporation of timestamps into the encoding / representation again limits generalizability substantially. \nI am also concerned about the experimental evaluation \u2014 which needs to be described in more detail. From the description of the dataset splits I get the impression that at least some leakage is introduced during model training / hyper parameter tuning? Also: It is not clear to me what the basis for the evaluation is. The authors mention week-wise splits but are the actual continuous sensor readings processed or the pre-segmented activities? I suspect it is the latter (judging by the results on the CASAS datasets [I have substantial experience in working with these] \u2014 which is a problem because this would be a rather unrealistic evaluation.\nThere are also some issues with the presentation: For example it remains unclear what the authors mean by \u201crhythm of ADL\u201d (which they aim to unveil). \nFinally, I think the claim of causality in general is a bit of a stretch here. Yes, filling up an empty room requires the door to be opened and shut, but activities covered in CASAS do not generally follow this causality principle."

Are you using pre-segmented activities or are you operating in continuous sensor data streams. Please provide evidence.\n3. The improvements in recognition accuracy are barely significant \u2014 as per the table, and you only compare to one set of baseline methods. There are other models out there, why not comparing to them?\n4. Why using such a rather exotic evaluation measure (balance accuracy) and not the regular macro F1 scores that one should use for such imbalanced datasets?"
