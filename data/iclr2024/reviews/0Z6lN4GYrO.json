S4G maintains similar inductive biases induced by regular MPNN but has the sensitivity with a linear decay. In this way, the message bottleneck problem is largely alleviated. Unlike transformer-based architecture, S4G does not need positional encodings or positional structures, which usually require a heuristic design. Empirical study shows that S4G consistently has superior performance over long-range tasks, which also corroborates their theoretical claims."

The fundamental idea builds on two observations: (1) Graph neural networks have strong relational inductive bias, but they are subject to an exponential decay in information with increasing number of layers and (2) Graph transformers are subject to only constant decay in information but they typically lack appropriate graph inductive biases. The idea is to use \"structured state spaces\" to capture the hierarchical structure of rooted-trees from the source nodes, and to keep strong inductive bias while having only linear decay of information. Authors present experimental results on long-range and general graph benchmarks."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- **Scholarship**: The paper fails to present a good coverage of the related work which also makes the contributions questionable. This is particularly the case with the coverage of recent multi-hop approaches. Authors mention that multi-hop models do not help with e.g. over-squashing as they rely on taking the powers of the adjacency matrix which amplifies the over-squashing problem. This is true, but this is exactly the reason why other multi-hop approaches have been studied extensively, see e.g. [1], where the idea is to directly aggregate information from higher-order neighbours obtained using shortest path distances (a sensitivity analysis is also conducted). \n\n- **Novelty, Originality, and Significance**: To the best of my understanding, the proposed idea of this paper appears to be largely covered by [1], since rooted trees are essentially constructed in the exact same way and aggregation is over the respective neighbourhoods $N_1...N_k$ of a particular node. Moreover, the graphormer model [2] follows essentially a very similar path: it aggregates over the neighbors at different shortest path distances directly. I do not see a fundamentally new or novel aspect in the present work, and neither a significant contribution. I'm happy to re-evaluate if the authors could better frame their approach in the existing literature and can identify the differences and contributions.\n\n- **Experiments on Long Range Graph Benchmarks**: The empirical results do appear promising, but unfortunately, the benchmark of Dwiwedi et al has been criticised recently [3] and it turns out that the gap between GNNs and graph transformers either disappears or becomes insignificant after a systematic tuning of the GNN models. This is a very recent finding and the current paper cannot be held responsible, but given that this is one of the two experiments conducted, the validity of the proposal remains questionable. It is also unclear whether the above-mentioned approaches, i.e., graphormers, would match the presented results. \n\n- **Technical limitations**: There are many limitations of the sensitivity analysis of Topping et al (and other approaches are proposed recently see eg  [4]). It requires bounded derivatives (which may not hold in practice) and also a normalised adjacency matrix. It is easy to see that without the assumption on the latter the values will explode rather than vanishing. On the other hand, it is easy to show that simple tricks (such as a fully connected layer, or adding a virtual node) can theoretically \"maximize\" this bound, and a systematic evaluation is needed against these simple model variations to clearly identify the benefit of the proposed idea.\n\n[1] Aboud et al.

However, over-smoothing is caused by the lack of local neighborhood information. S4 aims to better capture distant information, which seems to be in the opposite direction of addressing over-smoothing. The experiments didn\u2019t touch over-smoothing either.\n- Lack of expressiveness analysis: By converting a neighborhood into a sequence, the model considers the shortest distance, but would inevitably lose other structural information. E.g., the model doesn\u2019t know the edges between hop $k-1$ and hop $k$, i.e., for a certain node at hop $k-1$ which nodes at hop $k$ are connected to it. This questions the expressiveness of the proposed model. Theoretical analysis is necessary to justify the expressiveness and support the empirical results, but it\u2019s missing.\n- According to the experiments, the performance of S4G itself is not good enough on several datasets, while S4G+, which contains an extra MPNN layer, can do significantly better.
