                "value": "The study introduces a groundbreaking training paradigm called ITIT, designed for vision-language generative models. ITIT capitalizes on cycle consistency to train on unpaired image and text datasets, thereby minimizing reliance on costly and extensive paired datasets. The architecture features a single encoder for both image and text data, along with distinct decoders for each. A minimal amount of paired data is employed for baseline training, while the bulk of the training leverages unpaired data, regulated by cycle consistency to maintain output fidelity. Experimental evaluations reveal that ITIT achieves performance levels similar to existing leading models but with a significantly reduced need for paired data. Furthermore, the study confirms the model's ability to effectively scale with unpaired data. ITIT paves the way for more efficient and economical training of vision-language models."

In addition, the paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed ITIT framework, demonstrating its efficacy in both image-to-text and text-to-image generation tasks with comprehensive experiments.\n\n3.

While the paper mentions techniques to reduce computational overhead by one-step back-propagation in the I2T2I cycle, it does not provide quantitative metrics to evaluate the efficiency of these techniques. For the pre-trained data used in the experiments, ITIT still uses 4M paired data and 398M unpaired data to compete with the method that uses 398M paired data. In that case, the overall computational overhead is larger than the traditional paired data training. Can you provide some analysis in comparing the training efficiency between the paired data training and the ITIT.\n\n2. The pseudo-synthesized data pairs could be noisy at the beginning of the training since the generator is not trained yet, I am wondering whether the pseudo-data pairs generated at the beginning will play negatively on the performance."

Specifically, regarding the method of reducing memory consumption, the core idea is that the author found that generating training data from 0 to 1 has too high a memory cost, so they first go from 0 to 1 (without calculating the gradient), then manually return to 0.9, and redo 0.9 to 1. From this point of view, the contribution is somewhat engineering-oriented. \n\nOther issues. There are a few other issues: \n1. The author only mentions a reduction in memory usage, but the time consumption should be quite large, which is a disadvantage. Any justification for this?\n2. The I2T2I method seems a bit unreasonable because the latter half of T2I can already generate many kinds of images, so why must reconstructing the image necessarily be correct? \n3. For visual-language cycle consistency, there are two papers already: 'Equivariant Similarity for Vision-Language Foundation Models' (ICCV 2023), and 'CyCLIP: Cyclic Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining' (NeurIPS 2022). In this submission, there is an image-text encoder, for which it\u2019s very straightforward to use the above two methods as a baseline (in the cycle consistency of embedding). So the reviewer is quite curious about how the cycle of embedding compares to the cycle of generating data."

In this case, I believe that generating pseudo-targets would be more powerful:  1) it is computationally efficient and 2) it could easily integrate with the recent pre-trained models such as BLIP v2, stable-diffusion, and so on. (since the generation process of pseudo-targets are model-agnostic)\n\n\n2. Given that ITIT employs synthetically generated captions or images during the training process, there is a reasonable expectation that numerous failure cases may occur. This concern is particularly pronounced with datasets like CC3M, which are known to consist of noisy image-text pairs, potentially leading to a higher frequency of failures.\n It would be grateful if authors could share the fair cases."

Is it possible to extend the method for using diffusion based model for the T2I?\n4.

Is there any other reason besides different numbers of parameters? Or maybe Shutterstock data is so similar that scaling data does not make a difference, but on more diverse datasets the Figure 4 claim will not hold?\n2. How does ITIT generalize to new/different domains without paired data in that domain (assuming unpaired domain specific text and image available)? One example readers might be interested in could be medical imaging where paired data is much more difficult to obtain.\n3. Unclear compatibility with other types of generative models such as diffusion/flow/consistency models as the I2T stage. How much does the ITIT framework depends on the unified architecture? Does ITIT work with any kind of T2I I2T model?\n4. ITIT essentially denoises training data by learning a better alignment as shown in Figure 6. Does it worth to study other methods that also cleans the data, e.g. simply CLIP filtering with high confidence as pseudo labels, i.e. semi-supervised discriminative learning? This might keep the \u201cblue\u201d information in Figure 6 as well?\n5. Runtime due to the pseudo pair generation stage. The appendix mentioned that the ITIT requires 2x training time compared with T2I and I2T non-cycle training, but how is it the case considering the 24 steps of decoding happening? How much of the time was spent on the online pseudo pair generation stage? Does it require careful batching or implementation for good TPU utilization?\n6. Although scaling data is left to future work, the value of this paper depends a lot on the promise of further scaling unpaired image and text data beyond the combination of all current paired datasets. Are we still able to collect 10x high quality images/texts but not paired? Do we still need more data in this domain? Unfortunately this has not been shown to a good extent."
