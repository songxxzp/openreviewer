                "value": "* **Limited Methodology contribution and novelty**. Firstly, the sketch is just one special statistical functionals equipped with a specified kernel function, which is typically less commonly used than quantiles or samples. Working on algorithms simply based on a new concept may not contribute to the real development of this research field. More importantly, feature mapping has already been implicitly considered in MMDDRL paper [1], where MMD naturally induces a feature map. Notably. [1] also shows that not all kernels will lead to a convergent distributional Bellman operator, about which this paper has not fully discussed. From the perspective of new algorithms, Sketch-DP or TD is not new to me and even straightforward. Its concrete version, e.g., in Proposition 4.4 is very similar to the categorical representation. The choice of different feature maps also has a strong correlation with the MMD equipped with different kernels. Based on my knowledge of RKHS, different kernel naturally induces a RHKS with a specific feature map. Therefore, I do not think the sketch framework has sufficient methodological contribution compared with existing works.\n\n* **Insufficient theoretical analysis**. The biggest issue in the theoretical part is the pre-specification of a metric $d$ such that it is $\\gamma^c$ contractive, which is a strong assumption. With a metric that can already guarantee the contraction, the approximation error is easy to show. Further, as mentioned in the first weakness, not all feature maps can guarantee the contraction. For example, [1] gave some counterexamples for the convergence when we use Gaussian kernels. Therefore, the current paper lacks a crucial theoretical part about what kinds of feature maps can guarantee the contraction and then bound the errors. Without this crucial part, I personally think the current theoretical results are insufficient.  \n\n* **Insignificant empirical improvements**. The viewpoint of limited methodological contribution is further demonstrated by the insignificant empirical improvements in Figure 5. Although I truly agree on the conclusion that the sketch framework slightly improves C51 and QRDQN, it performs worse than IQN. Hence, I only view the sketch paper as a feature map-based algorithm, which has already been implicitly investigated before, rather than a novel one with significant performance. The insignificant improvement also let me rethink what is the real motivation of the sketch framework. \n\n\n[1] Thanh Nguyen-Tang, Sunil Gupta, and Svetha Venkatesh.
