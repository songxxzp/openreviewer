This paper should be accepted in its current form. Addressing my concerns and questions would improve my score.\n\nThe paper introduces an efficient finetuning method, ELoRA, for pretrained language models, addressing the storage challenge when deploying numerous adapted models. ELoRA achieves a 10x reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA, while maintaining performance levels, as demonstrated on the GLUE benchmark. It leverages shared random low-rank matrices and small layer-wise trainable scaling vectors to reduce memory usage. This approach is ideal for scenarios requiring multiple finetuned models, such as cloud-based personalized AI services, by improving serving efficiency. The method's potential application in various domains and further optimizations like dynamic parameter allocation are areas for future research."

Although the ideas of the submission and that paper are quite different (also, the paper is quite recent), in my opinion, it would be great to mention LiDB (Lightweight DreamBooth) in the related work section to give the reader additional context.\n* My primary concern with respect to the experiments is that the instruction tuning evaluation is performed mostly through GPT-4 queries on a very small dataset. In my opinion, this approach suffers both from the lack of reproducibility (as we know, the model behind the GPT-4 API might change in the future) and a narrow coverage of possible contexts that might result in high variance of the metric. I think that using more established benchmarks (such as MMLU or BIG-Bench) would give a better picture of how instruction-finetuned models perform after PEFT.\n* Similarly, I think that broader evaluation of instruction tuning should include a larger set of models than just LLaMA-2. Personally, I would move Table 4 and Table 5 to the appendix (they take a lot of space and are not directly related to the topic of the paper) and replace that with additional experiments, ideally for models with higher parameter counts.\n\n[1] HyperDreamBooth: HyperNetworks for Fast Personalization of Text-to-Image Models.

I wonder if you have explored this idea in preliminary experiments? It is quite surprising to me that a single random structure is sufficient for PEFT across all layers in a Transformer model \u2014 perhaps there is something we can infer from that.\n* I think that the work would benefit from a bit more analysis behind the reasons of why random projections work that well in the context of parameter-efficient finetuning. At the very least, it might be interesting to compare the structure of the learned weights for LoRA and ELoRA trained with a single rank: intuitively, the latter should approximate the former, but is that true in practice?"
