The tracks have been identified after a significant amount of preprocessing, including temporal interpolation of the satellite image sequences. Based on this dataset, the authors have posed two problems: localization of the cyclone's position, and estimation of its intensity. Based on intensity, each even has been categorized as deep depression, sever cyclonic storm etc. They can be solved using Deep Learning models, similar to the object detection techniques like YOLO, RCNN etc which the authors have tested as benchmarks on this dataset."

However, these are standard general-purpose object detection models. There has been significant research in recent years, using more advanced DL models for cyclone track prediction. Admittedly, those track predictions are not necessarily based on IR satellite imagery which the authors have done. However, to provide the context, the authors should have discussed those regarding the benchmarking. Furthermore, computer vision also has significant research on object tracking in videos, which is more suitable to this application than image-by-image detection as done by YOLO or RCNN. The authors have not used those for benchmarking, making the paper rather weak for ICLR. \n\nFor example, some important references can be:\n1) Deepti: Deep-Learning-Based Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation System by Maskey et al, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 2020.\n2) A Center Location Algorithm for Tropical Cyclone in Satellite Infrared Image by Wang et al, EEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 2020.\n3) MGTCF: Multi-Generator Tropical Cyclone Forecasting with Heterogeneous Meteorological Data by Huang et al, AAAI 2023"

Cyclones are very complex structures, and developing new representations for them through Neural features from IR Satellite imagery for detection, tracking and intensity estimation would have made a solid contribution. I encourage the authors to work on this."

However, it is not compared to the experiments. Hence, it is not clear if any of the tested models is applicable or an improvement in this field. I believe this would be a good/reasonable paper for a remote sensing or application-specific conference or journal. However, the value for ICLR is not clear.\n\nThere are also several points in the text that hint towards a lack of care in this submission.\n* The introduction makes several high-level statements without citations. E.g., \"In literature, there have been some well-documented datasets for cyclone intensity estimation\". However, none are cited.\n* citations are stated twice, such as \"Maskey et al. Maskey et al. (2023)\" throughout the entire paper.\n* the paper is a half-page over length.\n\nThis lack of quality is surprising given that this paper is a resubmission and was previously rejected. However, to my knowledge, little or no feedback or input from previous reviews has been implemented. It appears to me that the authors resubmitted the identical text without re-reading the compiled PDF, checking the citations, or modifying the length."
