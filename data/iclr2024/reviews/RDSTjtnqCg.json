                "value": "This paper investigates modern deep learning systems' ability to identify out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. It critically analyzes the extremely simple activation shaping (ASH) method, finding that activation pruning hinders, while activation scaling improves OOD detection. The authors propose two methods: SCALE, a post-training enhancement that boosts OOD detection without affecting in-distribution accuracy, and Intermediate Tensor SHaping (ISH), a training-time method for enhancing OOD detection. These methods show significant performance improvements on the OpenOOD v1.5 ImageNet-1K benchmark."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Incorrect Motivation: The author seems to have not conducted sufficient research in the field of OOD detection. Generally, OOD detection requires the model to identify OOD data without affecting the accuracy of ID classification. Hence, there should not be a trade-off between ID classification accuracy and OOD detection performance. Post-hoc OOD detection refers to performing OOD detection through post-processing algorithms without altering the model parameters. Consequently, React, Dice, and ASH  utilize the original classifier for ID classification tasks and a modified classifier for OOD detection tasks, introducing a very minimal computational overhead. Therefore, I believe there is a problem with the motivation presented in the introduction section of the paper.\n2. Limited Novelty: SCALE and ISH are incremental works of ASH. Thus, I attribute the commendable performance of ISH and SCALE mainly to the superior performance of ASH. The performance improvement over ASH is quite minimal.\n3. Unsubstantiated Claim on React: The author claims that React \u201chinders the OOD detection process.\u201d However, this analysis is solely theoretical and lacks experimental validation. I think the results from SCALE+React or ISH+React could potentially validate this point.\n4. Minimal Performance Gain: As observed from Table 5, the performance improvement brought by combining ISH and SCALE compared to using SCALE alone is extremely minimal. I am curious to know if combining ISH with other OOD detectors (e.g., ISH+MSP/ODIN/Energy/React/ASH) could yield any performance improvement.\n5. Lack of Ablation Study: The paper is missing an ablation study related to the placement of SCALE, specifically, how its performance varies when placed after different stages of ResNet50."

                "value": "This work studies the problem of OOD detection. It starts by analyzing a recent SOTA method, ASH, where the analysis successfully disentangles the effect of ASH's two building components, namely pruning and scaling. Surprisingly, it is found that while scaling benefits the separation of ID and OOD score, pruning actually adversely hurts it. Based on this analysis, a new post-hoc method named SCALE is proposed. Furthermore, a training-time regularization that echoes the working mechanism of SCALE is also proposed (ISH). Both SCALE and ISH achieves improvements over closely-related and competitive baselines on multiple benchmarks."

                "value": "1. The written and presentation quality of this manuscript is good. Easy to follow, and the logic is smooth and sound.\n2. The analysis of ASH and the insights originate from the analysis are valuable for two reasons. First, ASH indeed leads to superior performance (a recent SOTA), and thus understanding why it works is of course important. Second, the finding that scaling actually benefits OOD detection the most is surprising. In a bigger picture, I think this finding contradicts the common belief that pruning / rectifying is the (only) right direction (this can be evidenced by that many methods, e.g., ReAct, DICE, ASH, adopt such general design idea).\n3. The analysis is backed up by both theoretical investigation (Proposition 3.1) and empirical evidences (Table 1 and Figure 2 - 4).\n4. The developed method is motivated by the analysis, making it sound and valid.\n5. The empirical improvement on OpenOOD ImageNet-1K benchmark is convincing. In the first place, I also like it that the authors consider a unified benchmark for evaluation, which many works failed to do. This will definitely encourage follow-up works to continue making fair and straight comparison, which would benefits the whole OOD detection community."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I have two minor comments.\n\n1. For CIFAR experiments, I strongly encourage the authors to refrain from using LSUN-Crop and LSUN-Resize as OOD datasets, if they are directly taken from the ODIN paper. LSUN-Resize has been shown to exhibit obvious resizing artifacts [1], which make the detection trivially easy. LSUN-Crop is 32x32 crops from images with larger resolution, and arguably the resulting samples will have unnaturally different distribution compared to CIFAR's 32x32 natural images, which again makes the evaluation less meaningful.\n\n2. The \"Comparison with OOD traning methods.\" subtitle in Sec. 4.3 has a typo (\"traning\" -> \"training\"), and should be placed in the same line as the leading sentence of the next paragraph. There also should be a blank space in \"LogitNorm(Wei et al., 2022)\". I would suggest a proof-reading to further improve the quality.\n \n[1] CSI: Novelty Detection via Contrastive Learning on Distributionally Shifted Instances"
