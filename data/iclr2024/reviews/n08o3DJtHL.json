            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- From the perspective of the system, the major technical contribution proposed in this paper, i.e. NF-ICP, is used as a post-processing component in the system. More concretely, the previous pipeline would be LVD (Corona et al. 2022) -> template fitting -> refinement; with NF-ICP added, the pipeline becomes LVD -> NF-ICP -> template fitting -> refinement. While LVD provides the most important initialization, the effect of NF-ICP is relatively incremental. The significance of the contribution in terms of scope seems to be on the minor side.\n\n- From the methodology point of view, the current formulation of NF-ICP evaluates the correspondences and offset only at the target scan points. However, the neural field does not guarantee consistent prediction over different points in the space. Since the vertices are initialized at (0, 0, 0), having an ICP error over the target scan does not guarantee the correctness of offset for points far from the scan surface.\n\n- Since this NF-ICP is a add-on post-processing step, I believe that the central question to discuss is the necessity of NF-ICP in the LVD -> template fitting -> refinement pipeline. Essentially the question here is how much benefit does the additional NF-ICP step brings in comparison with directly using SMPL for the template fitting & ICP, which is the traditional model fitting approach with LVD initialization. On the one hand, the paper gives some quantitative evidence of this by comparing \"LVD + R\" with \"Ours + R\" in Table 4 (1.11 -> 1.06, 2.48 -> 2.26) and 6 (6.27 -> 6.13), and Table 3 (3.26 -> 3.08) in the supplementary document, where the improvement seems to be relatively minor.\n\n- On the other hand, some qualitative results are presented beside Table 6, and in Figure 2 & 3 of the supplementary material. However, these examples show that the SMPL model-fitting is under-regularized in the experimental setup of the paper. SMPL encodes a strong prior of human body shape and pose. A well-regularized model fitting process should prevent many of the artifacts from happening. In addition, it is possible to use the LVD initialization together with ICP, instead of completely relying on the LVD correspondences. For such reasons, I believe that the some of the artifacts presented by LVD + R may not necessarily happen under a proper implementation of classical SMPL model fitting."

                "value": "- Since my major concern is about the necessity of NF-ICP in a registration pipeline, my central questions for the author is whether more evidence of the advantage of Ours + R over LVD + R can be provided. Here LVD + R should have proper regularization, for example shape regularization by penalizing beta and pose regularization by setting proper prior weight, and balancing between LVD initialization term and ICP term.\n\n- In the FAUST experiment, why is there a setting where input shape is the registration (FaustR)? What is the purpose of this setting?\n\n- Why does this method use 690 vertices instead of 6890 vertices in the original LVD experiment?\n\n- In the LVD paper, their Eq (1) wrote that the neural field g maps a point $\\mathbf v_i \\in \\mathbb R^3$ to $\\Delta \\mathbf v_i \\in \\mathbb R^3$, while in their implementation it is actually predicting offset of all the vertices as in this paper (maps $\\mathbf v_i \\in \\mathbb R^3$ to $\\Delta \\mathbf v \\in \\mathbb R^{6890 \\times 3}$). Although it is more of a fault of the LVD paper, maybe a footnote can be added in this submission to clarify this to avoid confusion for the audience."

Does the proposed algorithm work with just a single output head? \n- The results show shapes after SMPL fitting. This raises the question how much important this last step is? How do results look before this fitting? Are the error metrics computed only on the 690 sample points or on all points of the SMPL shapes?\n- What happens if the shape segmentation fails? \n- Supplementary, Fig 3: While many of the red points are outlying, the set of points used for optimization might not be same as outlying. Which of the red points have been selected for optimization? How susceptible is the algorithm to outliers?"
