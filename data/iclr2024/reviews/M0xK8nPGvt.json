                "value": "This work proposes a posterior sampling algorithm to address the reinforcement learning problem given a partial causal graph. The method utilizes the knowledge of a partial causal graph to construct a set of plausible factored MDPs (FMDPs). Then, it is framed as a hierarchical Bayesian model, with a prior over the factorization (equivalently, the complete causal graph) at a higher level and priors over the transitions and rewards at a lower level (given the factorization). The proposed posterior sampling C-PSRL algorithm proceeds by first sampling a factorization from the posterior, then sampling the MDP's parameters from the posterior given the factorization, and computing the optimal policy given the sampled FMDP. The paper proves that the Bayesian regret of the proposed C-PSRL algorithm is sublinear in the number of episodes and shows that C-PSRL can identify a super-graph of the true causal graph."
