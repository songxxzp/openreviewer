                "value": "The paper proposes a method for realistic one-shot 3D talking face generation driven by videos and audio. Given an input source image, the method first reconstructs a canonical 3D face in the tri-plane representation with an Image-to-Plane (I2P) model. The I2P comprises 1. a ViT branch with a stack of SegFormer blocks to handle the canonicalization and a VGG branch to capture the high-frequency appearance features. The driving motion is represented by the projected normalized coordinate code (PNCC) [Zhu et al. 2016]. Instead of using the deformation field to animate as in previous papers, the method proposes to have a motion adapter composed of a shallow SegFormer to output the residual motion diff-plane given the PNCC. The sum of the canonical tri-plane and the motion diff-plane are volume-rendered and upsampled by a super-resolution module to end up with the source image driven by the given motion. Lastly, the background and the torso are composited with the Head-Torso-Background supersampling model. The driving PNCC can come from audio using an audio-to-motion model using a flow-enhanced VAE or video by fitting 3DMM to the reference video. The method is compared against Face-vid2vid [Wang et al. 2021], OT-Avatar [Ma et al. 2023], HiDe-NeRF [Li et al. 2023a] for the video-driven animation, and MakeItTalk [Zhou et al. 2020], PC-AVS [Zhou et al. 2021], and RAD-NeRF [Tang et al. 2022] for the audio-driven animation."

                "value": "Can authors clarify which 3DMM they use? Is it BFM2009 as referred from section 3.4, or is it [Blanz and Vetter 1999] as referred from B.2? Note that while they both use PCA, their bases are not compatible because they are computed from different data.\n\n(Related to my question above)\nIn 3.4, authors say:\n> 3DMM basis is a nonhomogeneous linear equation and has multiple solutions (e.g., BFM2009)...\n\nAt least for PCA-based 3DMMs like BFM2009 and [Blanz and Vetter 1999], this is incorrect. Because PCA bases are orthogonal, a unique least squares solution can be found by simply multiplying the principal components and the data (target 3D mesh vertex positions in this case). Because of this misunderstanding, the paper may have an over-complex setup in its audio-to-motion model.\n\nHow does the I2P model handle an input image with a non-neutral face? I.e., if the model is given an image with an extreme facial expression as the source image, what happens? Have authors thought about canonicalization in this respect? I believe a concurrent work, \"Generalizable One-shot Neural Head Avatar,\" canonicalizes the input expression as well. Perhaps this should be clarified as a limitation.\n\nCan authors actually show results if the deformation field is used instead of the residual motion diff-plane? The paper just says \"bad quality,\" but this is never properly compared. The comparison video says the main issue with HiDe-NeRF (which uses the deformation field) is the temporal jittering. However, the temporal jittering is mitigated in this paper by the temporal Laplacian loss, not by the residual motion diff-plane.\n\nCan authors provide results from multiple views to show how good the 3D reconstruction is?\n\nCan authors consider comparisons to Next3D [Sun et al. 2023]? I understand that Next3D is an animatable 3D GAN model requiring a GAN inversion to reproduce an identity. A discussion on a concurrent work, \"Generalizable One-shot Neural Head Avatar,\" is not required but much appreciated to understand the novelty of this work.\n\n(minor typo)\n3.1 Network Design\n> comprises a stack of SegFormer bock\n\nbock -> block"

Differently from prior work the proposed method provides a solution for both video and audio driven animation of the face and also provides a super-resolution module for correctly morphing the torso and in-filling the exposed background regions.

As the authors correctly point out animation in 3D versus 2D results is more correct handling of large head poses and less warping artifacts. So this is an important problem to address towards enabling large head pose facial talking head generation. \n\nIn comparison to the existing works on the topic, this work introduces a joint framework for both video and audio driven animation of 3D facial representations by encoding the audio signal into a PNCC representation. It also does a nice job of proposing to handle the torso and the background as a part of the overall solution thus enabling a more production-ready complete end-to-end framework. This is an often neglected detail in many works that treat the head in isolation from the backgrounds in which it exists requiring additional pre and post processing steps to deal with the torso and background."

This is because the PNCC code is derived purely from the target driving video/audio's expression and hence cannot contain the information to erase/neutralize the source image's facial expression. I think the proposed method achieves this canonicalization during the fine-tuning phase with the Celeb-V-HQ video dataset. However, in my experience without any further stronger constraints, the proposed method cannot fully remove the source image's original facial expression. Can the author show examples of these canonicalized 3D face reconstructions of the input images without applying the target expression? Related to this is the question of how robust is the proposed method to the presence of large facial expressions in the source image. Does it work for expressions where the source image has a wide open mouth and lowered jaw or nearly closed eyes, for example?\n\n2. Overall the proposed methods is an obvious combination of several existing ideas from prior works on the topic to culminate in a successful large engineered end-to-end solution. For example, the idea of using I2P was previously proposed in LP3D; the idea of using rendered target expression images from a 3DMM was proposed in Li et al., 2023b, the audio to PNCC code predictor is borrowed from prior work; and the torso warping module is also borrowed from Wang et al., 2021. While the proposed combination of existing ideas results in an effective solution, from the research perspective the overall solution is light on significant novel or surprising insights.\n\n3. The authors don't specify the dataset/protocol that they used for evaluation.\n\n4. Comparisons of the proposed method to several of the newer (than Face-Vid2Vid) and better performing video-driven 2D facial animation methods are missing.
