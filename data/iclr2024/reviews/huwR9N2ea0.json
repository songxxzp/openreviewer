I am not convinced that the proposed method ProUD is a useful method.\n- Some minor weaknesses. (1) The proposed methods need domain labels for domain-aware prototypes. This will restrict the methods when applied to the application. It would be good to consider whether there is a way to generalize the method to be domain label-free. (2) The methods are simple and trivial. In my understanding, PML loss (Equation 8) is pretty similar to SupCon [5].

The algorithm combines different ideas, some are new, and some are an adaptation from previous work, to provide an accurate solution to this problem. Most of the important techniques involve pseudo-labeling to provide labels to the unlabeled data, and a method called Domain mix that tries to control and manage the contribution for very uncertain pseudo-labeling (very important in the first steps of the algorithm, where the pseudo-labels are not going to be precise).\n\nThe authors run extensive different experiments on real datasets, comparing their method to a wide range of baselines in the literature.

Although there may be domain-invariant features that we can learn from multiple sources, different features may provide different information depending on the domain.\nAs an example assume that there are two features f_A and f_B,  domain A may get a very good classification from a feature f_A (and not f_B), and domain B may get a very good classification from a feature f_B (and not f_A). In this case, it would make more sense to build different models that can exploit different features across the different domains. In your algorithm, this means that we keep the feature extractor g equal, but we build a function h for each different domain (similar strategies are also applied in ZSL).\n\nIn the data inequality model, some data sources may have a different number of examples. In particular, it could be that we have access to comparatively fewer data points for a given unlabeled domain. It looks to me that your model gives the same weight to each sample from each domain. In this case, if an unlabeled domain t is unrepresented (we have less data  N_t from it), then your model would still suffer from a data inequality issue, as the loss would be less influenced by the fewer samples on this unlabeled domain.\n\n\nOn the experiments:\n- Is it the accuracy with respect to a held-out dataset? Or is the model evaluated on the same unlabeled data that is also used during training?\n- Why is the accuracy averaged over the last 5 train epochs rather than only on the last epoch?\n- I cannot find an explanation on how the hyper-parameters are chosen for your algorithms (is there a validation step?), and how the hyper-parameters are chosen for the baseline algorithms. I think this is important when evaluating methods on a new dataset (without overfitting due to the choice of the hyper-parameters).\n- I believe that the standard deviation for the average accuracy is not reported. In particular, you obtain an average accuracy over 3 runs (with 3 different seeds), but it is not clear what is the variance of this value, which is important for comparison with other methods. (The reported STD is across the domain combinations rather than on the 3 seeded runs)."

Why do you learn a single model for each domain, and how do you handle the case when an unlabeled domain is under-represented (it has fewer samples than other unlabeled domains)?\n\n------------\n\n\n\nA couple of suggestions:\n- \"dist is a function to measure the cosine distance\" -> \"dist is the cosine distance\". \n- It would be useful for the reader to get some intuitions behind some equations (in simple words), such as (1) and (3).\n- I would add a very synthetic explanation of what a \"prototype\" is for clarity.\n- I would briefly clarify that the shift that you are considering is only on the distribution of the features (unless I am missing something), but the classification problem is the same across all tasks.\n- There are other settings that are \"similar\" to this that would maybe be worth discussing in the introduction / related work as further motivation. One setting is Zero-shot Learning (ZSL), where we do not have access to unlabeled data for the other domains (and the classification may change, and one is provided with a description of the classes). Another setting is (programmatic) weak supervision, where the goal is to design simple rules to label an unlabeled domain, and pseudo-labeling and noise-aware losses are also used (e.g., see [A]).\n\n[A]: Ratner, Alexander, et al. \"Snorkel: Rapid training data creation with weak supervision.\" Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment.
