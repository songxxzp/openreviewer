It is argued that responses generated in this way are more distinguishable, producing a better signal-to-noise ratio. The produced rankings between pairs are then used for training a preference model, and subsequently, RLHF. Experiments are conducted on three alignment tasks, showing better performance than RLAIF and context distillation baselines."

The analysis on the preference model shows that the preference model produced by RLCD is, while better than the baseline, still not very good, especially on the harmlessness attribute (Tab. 5). It is not clear how this slight advantage over chance (2.4%~5.9%) translates into a much better downstream performance after RLHF.\n2. As shown in Appendix C, RLAIF-Few-30B produces both a better preference model and a better-aligned language model than RLCD-30B on the harmlessness benchmark, which is attributed to few-shot prompting by the authors. It seems that this technique can also be integrated into RLCD to enable a fairer comparison.\n3. The advantage of RLCD over RLAIF shrinks going from 7B to 30B (Tab. 2). It remains to be seen whether RLCD (or RLCD-Rescore) can scale to yet larger language models that are arguably better at differentiating responses near the decision boundary."

This method creates clearer preference pairs for training a preference model, which is then used to improve a base unaligned language model via reinforcement learning.

Similarly for the human evaluation in Table 2.\nAnd in the Helpfulness and Outlining tasks, the baseline RLAIF-30B scored higher than the proposed RLCD-30B). I have a few questions on this:\n- Why does the proposed RLCD algorithm gain a bigger advantage on the smaller LlaMA model when compared with its baselines? Is it due to the poor performance of RLAIF with smaller models?\n- For the helpfulness and outlining tasks, the baseline RLAIF-30B outperformed the proposed RLCD. What is the cause of this result and should we generally adopt RLAIF when a larger LLM is available?\n- The human evaluation always preferred RLCD compared with RLAIF, in contrast to GPT 4's preference on RLCD-30B. Can the authors please provide some insights into the cause of the difference in the GPT4 vs. human evaluation?\n\nThe downstream fine-tuning is using PPO. Although not the main contribution of the paper, can the authors please provide the details of the downstream fine-tuning procedures? For example, what are input and output of the RL model, what is the reward used by PPO derived from the upstream preference generation? And the overall process of the RL fine-tuning? This information would be useful for a general audience who would like to use the proposed RLCD method."

                "value": "- How did you decide on the prompt affix pairs?\n- Why is having more than one prompt affix pair important? \n- Given that you automatically assume $o_{+}$ is preferred - how often does $o_{+}$ have a lower reward with respect to a held-out reward function?\n- Why would training examples far away from the boundary be better than training examples close to the boundary? I would assume that the points far away could be easy to classify.\n- Could you elaborate on how you performed your GPT-4 evaluation? What prompt did you use? How did you shuffle the data? Etc?\n- Could you provide other quantitative metrics for all algorithms considered in your experiments? (e.g., RM-score, perplexity, output-perplexity, etc.)\n - Did you perform GPT-4 evaluation using comparisons from the algorithms-generated output and human-generated data for a given prompt?\n- Could you provide other diversity metrics on the outputs of the text generated? (e.g., the ratio of distinct n-grams (Distinct-1, Distinct-2), average length of sentences, or count of n-grams in the generated text [1]). The text in Table 4 implies that RLCD generations are much longer than the base model sentences.\n- Could you elaborate on the RLCD-Resouce model setup? In particular, what does it mean to re-label the same scoring prompts as in RLAIF?\n- For RLAIF, did you run an experiment where you sample two outputs from the $p_{+}$ positive affix prompts? This provides RLAIF algorithms with modified prompts similar to RLCD and would reduce the advantage that RLCD has to strictly have the altered $p_{-}$ prompts.\n\n[1] A diversity-promoting objective function for neural conversation models by Li et al. 2015"
