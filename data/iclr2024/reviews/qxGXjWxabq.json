The authors introduce several approximations that lead to significant speed-ups, making Canonpipe capable of data error discovery that is as effective as existing Monte Carlo baselines, and in some cases even outperform them. Overall, Canonpipe is a solution to the fundamental concern of discovering the data examples that are the most likely culprits for poor-quality ML models."

So it would be better if the authors could clarify this.\n+ The overall experiments seem not to be comprehensive since the authors only evaluate their methods on simple dataset, e.g., FashinoMNIST, with simple models, such as KNN model. It would be great if the authors could demonstrate that their proposed method can handle large-scale datasets such as the ImageNet dataset\n+ Although the authors refer to the earlier work on approximately evaluating Shapley values with KNN surrogate model, it is unclear to the readers how that can work, it would be better if the authors could briefly discuss this prior work, in particular what kind of correctness guarantee that can be obtained by approximately evaluating Shapley values with KNN surrogate models. This can make this paper more self-contained.\n+ Also, the overall presentation could be improved. Although the authors mentioned that the PTIME computation time can be achieved with ADD. all the discussions of ADD are included in the appendix along with the main algorithm. Since this is the main contribution of this paper, it would be better if the authors could put some of these core technical parts in the main paper and briefly discuss them there."

Then, this work proposes the concept of \u201ccanonical\u201d pipelines which allow directly relating inputs and outputs. By approximating pipelines as canonical, the proposed methods may achieve significant speed-ups for the Monte Carlo approach. Also, by combining canonical pipelines with the K-nearest neighbor as a proxy model, the proposed  PTIME Shapley computation algorithms allow applying KNN Shapley as a special case applicable to map pipelines.

However, one challenge of data valuation before pre-processing is that there may be different pre-processing pipelines between training and validation. For example, we can consider random data augmentation techniques used in training, but not for testing. Does this methodology handle different pre-processing pipelines, or for example, a validation pipeline that is a subset of the training pipeline?\n- Near Section 3.2/3.3 (or a detailed version in the Appendix), it would be useful to have a detailed dictionary of common pipelines / components and how they fit into Map, Fork, Join, or can be approximated by Map-reduce. This could be a table for example similar to Table 1. A table such as this would make the significance of the proposed work more clear in terms of how an ML practitioner can think of pre-processing steps in these pipelines.\n- If I understand the experiments correctly, the baselines are performing data importance on the raw data before pre-preprocessing. Furthermore, existing KNN Shapley methods cannot accurately model the combinatorial explosion in subsets obtained from a data pipeline, making them conceptually unattractive. However, one baseline in data repair may be to perform valuation on data points after pre-processing, and then simply invert the pipeline manually to determine the relevant raw data points. How would existing methods including KNN Shapley perform on label repair in terms of accuracy improvement and compute time? More generally, what is the practical significance of identifying data points for repair with a method that captures the pre-processing operations versus simply identifying potential points for repair after pre-processing and then inverting the preprocessing pipeline to determine affected raw data points?\n- The experiment protocol is not thoroughly explained and relies on referencing prior work (e.g., noise injection, measuring labor cost). It would be useful to include this discussion perhaps in Appendix.\n- There is some minor writing improvements to be made, for example, In page 2, set S is used without definition"

The paper claims that this condition holds for the following three pipelines: map, fork, and one-to-many join.\nThe second efficiency problem that the paper addresses is related to the performance of the ML model and the utility metric used to measure the quality of the model. In this case, the paper suggests to use KNN algorithm and requires that the model quality metric is additive.
