The question here is what actions should be taken by the execution devices when the latest inference result has not arrive yet. The algorithm involves planning a sequence of future actions instead of a single action and learning a latent representation for lists of future actions in an unsupervised manner. Then an RL policy is trained to solve the task with the action space being the latent representation. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of using latent representations as action spaces in both simulation environments and the real world."

                "value": "The paper proposes a method for solving real-time control tasks where the delay or the loss of the network packets may lead to fragmentary interaction. Specifically, this could happen when the remote controller fails to receive the observation on time and thus can not issue a new command to the robot. Without receiving correct commands at the correct timestep, the robot may standstill by doing nothing or repeating the last action. Both may induce a failure in task completion.\n\nTo address this, the paper proposes to generate an action sequence instead of a single action step when making decisions. Thus when the remote controller can not produce the new action sequence due to failing to receive the new observation, the robot can still realize what to do according to the remaining commands in the action sequence received last time. This is a bit like how traditional planning algorithms such as MPC work.\n\nTo achieve this, a modified VAE is trained to construct a latent action space, which serves as the action space for RL methods like TD3. Every time the actor-network chooses an action from the latent action space, the latent variable will be converted to a robot command sequence through the decoder. \n\nIn the experiments, several Mujoco environments are constructed to simulate the fragment interaction situation. The results show that the proposed method can overcome this problem and compete with the agents trained and deployed in an ideal environment. Besides, a robot snake experiments are conducted to show it can be applied to real robots."

As the main motivation of the method is to address a practical issue in the real-world robot learning environment, a comprehensive real-world evaluation should be conducted on a platform where the fragmentary interaction problem indeed exists and is critical to the robot's performance. \n\nThe paper only contains a short section about the snake robot experiment with simple proprioceptive observations. In this setting, the delay or the loss of the network packets rarely happens as the bandwidth should be enough for transmitting the small amount of data consisting of only 54-dimensional vectors without any high-dimensional images and lidar results. Also, if the snake fails to receive any commands, simply stopping by doing nothing and waiting for the new commands is acceptable. It is not like a legged robot, which may easily fall down if it can not receive a stable command stream. \n\nIn a word, my main concern is that it is not verified on robot platforms that indeed suffer from this problem like quadrupedal robots with multi-modal perception. Otherwise, I cannot believe the proposed method can solve the claimed problem."

The communication between the action executor and agent in reinforcement learning may be affected by packet loss and latency, potentially impacting the effectiveness of policy execution. In contrast to previous methods that directly generate multi-step action sequences, this paper proposes using sc-VAE to generate an intermediate representation in place of an action sequence. During actual execution, this intermediate representation is used to generate the corresponding action sequence. The paper introduces additional regularization for the influence of actions on the environment within the generated intermediate representation.\n\nThe proposed method's performance is tested in various Mujoco task environments and a real-world snake robot control task. The results indicate that MARS outperforms the advanced decision method that directly generates action sequences and a simple frame-skip method which makes decisions with lower frequency. Further ablation studies confirm that the proposed method can consider the influence of the environment when generating intermediate representations."

In the random FIMDP tasks mentioned in the paper, is the number of decision steps fixed within one trial or randomly decided during execution? As shown in Figure 11, a larger interval leads to lower performance, how will the method perform if trained with longer action sequences but executed with a shorter interval, compared with training with shorter action sequences?\n\n3. The paper mentions that MARS has better stationarity, but it doesn't provide relevant explanations and proofs. Additionally, in a real-time RL setting, where it's not guaranteed that the actions actually executed by the executor strictly match the policy's output, do the collected trajectory samples inherently lack stationarity? (you can regard the trajectory as being sampled from a rapidly changing environment transition probability)\n\n4. I noticed some interesting results. Why does it appear that MARS has a more pronounced advantage over frame-skips in simpler tasks than in more complex tasks?\n\n5. The application form of the method needs further clarification. Does the decoder need to be run on the execution device? If so, does this mean that latent representations will also be lost?\n\n6. Should the \"Musar\" method in Fig.5 and 6 be referred to as \"MARS\"?"
