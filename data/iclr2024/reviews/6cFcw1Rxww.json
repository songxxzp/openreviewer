The paper also mentions building on top of Shen et al., 2023 which introduces prioritized replay training (PRT) to GFNs, but this method doesn\u2019t appear as a baseline \u2014 so how much of the improvements are due to PRT and how much is due to the local search?\n- In addition to the hyper-parameter $I$ (number of revisions with local searches), I wished the number of backtracking steps and the acceptance rate were also studied \u2014 how much tuning did they require in order to get these good results?\n- Wall-clock time is never mentioned \u2014 how much overhead does the refining process of LS-GFNs incur? How about in terms of sampled states (instead of training rounds)?\n- One baseline I wished were included: given a first trajectory, resample the last K steps and only keeping the best candidate. This is akin to beam search in LLMs or go-explore in RL. Other nice-to-have baselines include top-p and top-k sampling."

A more intuitive name could be \u201cbacktrack\u201d, \u201crewind\u201d, or anything that doesn\u2019t suggest destruction.\n- The top plots in Figure 5 are strange: it looks like some curves go beyond 100% accuracy. Could you either fix them so we can still see the curves on the plot, or explain what is happening?\n- How can LS-GFNs recover from a biased backward policy? In other words, assume the forward policy is fine but the backward policy always backtracks to states which yield the same (high reward) candidate objects \u2014 how can LS-GFNs overcome this lack of exploration?\n- Please confirm that lines 7 and 8 in Algorithm 1 aren\u2019t swapped. If they aren\u2019t (which partially addresses my question above), wouldn\u2019t swapping them and extending $\\mathcal{D}$ with $\\tau_m$ further improve exploitation? Maybe this should be added as an ablation as well."
