Although I still feel the conclusions are a bit counter-intuitive, I'd like to raise my rating to 6, before seeing more cross validation from the community.\n\n====== original comments ======\n\n1. I'm not totally convinced that semantics in padding tokens have so much impact. My own empirical experience is that the padding tokens usually have very small attention scores (=> close to 0 attention probabilities) compared to meaningful tokens, and thus their semantics, if any, add little to the image features. Though, due to the large number of padding tokens, it might accumulate to somewhat significant impact, esp. when the prompt is short. This needs more systematic experiments to confirm, e.g. a diagram of the padding token impact w.r.t. the prompt length, where the prompts are randomly drawn from a pool.\n2. All the padding tokens are derived from the same input word embedding, and only differ in the positional encoding added to the word embedding. If you want to extract the main semantic component, why not take a simple mean of the padding embeddings? Why using SVD is advantageous?"

Firstly, after conducting an analysis on text embeddings post text encoder encoding, it is concluded that EOT is low-rank and contains a large volume of prior information. Therefore, it also includes the information desired to be suppressed during the image editing process. Consequently, the first improvement proposed is to suppress the negative information in the text embedding to restrain its expression during the generation process. The second enhancement optimizes the attention map during the inference process to be as close as possible to the information to be preserved, while distancing from the unwanted information. Judging by the results, optimal outcomes were achieved on most datasets."

In the first phase, this method uses coefficients to adjust the size of the negative information matrix to suppress the expression of negative information. If the singular value decomposition method is not employed, but instead, the entire matrix is multiplied by an attenuation factor, how would that affect the image editing results?\n3. From Table 3, it seems that 'the negative target prompt suppression loss' plays the most significant role.
