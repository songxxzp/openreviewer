Motivated by this proof of concept they propose, a sanity check to make sure that feature visualizations generated by a method are indeed processed by a model in the same way as the natural images used for its training, as well as, a theoretical framework regarding the reliability of feature visualizations. Finally, the theoretical framework points out toward simpler models as more likely to be interpretable with the help of feature visualization and they offer preliminary evidence backing up that hypothesis."

Do the authors have intuition about the limitation of the sanity check, i.e., how could the sanity check be fooled? \n- While the experiments proposed are indeed not model-specific, half seem to be done using an Inception and the other half a ResNet50, is there a reason for this inconsistency?\n- Regarding the sanity check I would be very curious to see the results from other baseline to further explore the causes that could explain the difference. \n\t- (a) Is it simply a question of the ood-ness of the feature visualization as pointed out by Figure 3? In that case, I would be curious to see as extra baselines such as natural images vs natural images of the same class from another dataset (e.g., [1]) and natural images vs natural images of different classes from another dataset. \n\t- (b) Is it a question of the naturalness of the feature visualization as they look quite different from natural images or simply a problem of the fact that the visualization is optimized? In that case, I would be curious to see the results from methods that enforce more natural-looking images either by making use of a generative model ([2-3]) or that simply use specific regularization for that ([4]).\n- Not putting this in weakness, but I am not sure what to make of the theoretical section. Even though feature visualizations have been shown, at times ([4-5-6-7]), to offer insights about the network's unit activation, the main takeaway of this section, for now, is to caution that there is no guarantee that this is a general trend or that the insights are not only at a coarse level, which is important to keep in mind but it does not invalidate the empirical results previously cited. That being said, if one of the conclusions of this section is that alternatives to the current paradigm of activation maximization should be seriously considered by the community, it would be insightful if the authors could suggest possible alternatives that would overcome some of the limitations pointed out in this work.\n- With regard to softening the claims (and w.r.t the previous point), one concrete suggestion is, in the conclusion: \": Given that our theory proves that visualizing black-box systems via feature visualizations based on activation maximization (i.e., the current dominant paradigm) is impossible -> \"Given that our theory proves that there is no guarantee that ... is possible\"\n\n\n[1] Bitterwolf, Julian, Maximilian M\u00fcller, and Matthias Hein. \"In or Out?
