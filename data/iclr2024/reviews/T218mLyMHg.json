Then directly placing them on the methodology part will more or less limit the novelty of this paper. I think placing them on the Section 2 will be better and the authors can add more explanation of rationality of the proposed method.\n\n3.

                "value": "1. Although the multi-view graph fusion problem is interesting, the method to tackle this problem is somewhat straightforward. It directly contruct the graph for each attribute view and transfer the problem to the conventional multiple graph fusion setting. Therefore, the proposed method is still a multiple graph fusion method essentially and do not provide any deeper insight to the multi-view graph fusion problem. After constructing the Laplacian matrix for each attribute view, the method only uses the Laplacian without the attribute view, and thus the rich information behind the attribute view is abandoned. However, I think it is the information in the multiple attribute view that is the key difference between the multi-view graph learning and the conventional multiple graph learning.\n\n2. Since the method uses multiple Laplacian, whose size is n-by-n, for fusion. The space complexity should also be provided. In the experiments, the authors use the MAG data set, which is a large scale data set. Intuitively, the proposed method may suffer from the out-of-memoty problem on this data set, but the experimental results show that the proposed one can run a result. It would be better to explain why and how the proposed method can handle this large scale data set. Could you report the memory consumed by the proposed method?\n\n3. The optimization is a two-step method, i.e., it first optimize the eigengap objective and then it optimizes the connectivity objective. I think it is a suboptimal and need to be justified. For example, in the second step, when optimizing the eigengap objective, it is very probably that the eigengap objective will increase a lot. How to balance these two objectives?\n\n4. It would be better to provide the time complexity of the COBYLA algorithm in Lines 4 and 5 in Algorithm 1."

SMGF approximates the connections between entities by aggregating view-specific graph structures and constructs a multi-view Laplacian matrix from normalized Laplacian matrices representing all views. View weights are determined through the optimization of two objectives based on the spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix, leveraging eigenvalue gap and connectivity enhancement. The paper presents comprehensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets, demonstrating that SMGF outperforms existing methods in terms of node embedding, clustering results, efficiency, and scalability."

Currently, the explanation and performance of existing approaches are quite satisfactory. The motivation stated in this paper, \"Existing approaches often lack efficacy, efficiency, and the ability to explicitly control view contributions,\" is not valid. There are various methods for weighting different views and plenty of adaptive weighting techniques. The algorithms also exhibit linear time complexity. Therefore, I find this motivation less convincing.\n\n2. The second concern is the use of spectral properties based on spectral clustering, which doesn't appear to be a novel contribution. The method section mainly revolves around basic concepts, and I believe the essence of the graph fusion process is not adequately explained. It remains unclear why a particular view dominates, and the approach based on \"eigengap and connectivity objectives\" appears rather ordinary.\n\n3. The third issue is the mediocre performance of the algorithm. It seems that the improvement in algorithm performance is minimal, and the paper lacks statistical analysis to support the claimed enhancements. Additionally, there is no significant analysis demonstrating the effectiveness. Moreover, the algorithm's performance on the IMDB dataset is considerably worse compared to URAMN."
