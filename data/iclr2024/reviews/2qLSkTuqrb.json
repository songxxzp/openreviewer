IIUC, the hope is that the neural model may possibly guide neurobiological investigations, while the statistical model can be fit to real-world data and provide explanatory power.\n\nAs a demonstration, they fit the statistical model to data from both simulated and real-world data, including, apparently, a completely new dataset. The model seems able to capture and differentiate underlying structure in the agent's behaviors."

More pressingly, it seems impossible to replicate the proposed method from the inadequate description provided in the paper.\n\n- Simply understanding what the authors try to do exactly is a challenge, because the explanation of the various parts of the method are split into multiple parts (and the Appendix), The authors don't explain what they call a \"cognitive\", \"neural\" or \"statistical model\" until page 4, in the Results.\n\n- The introduction and discussion are very lengthy and philosophical, while the figures are absurdly small and the description of the methods either inadequate or just plain missing. The most basic explanation of what is actually going on is largely pushed to the Appendix. Even then, the explanation is not sufficient to reproduce the method. See Questions, below."

Monotonic?\n\n- The successor representation is described as \"Discounted expected occupancy\" - but this is notoriously policy-dependent. Instead, the authors actually base theiur successor representation M on the iterated transition matrix (action-independent, IIUC). so it's really a distance function! (it might be understood as \"occupancy under random policy\")\n\n- In the neural model, is M specified by hand or is it learned ? Appendix A.1 seems to indirectly imply that it is learned (whereas it is fixed for the statistical model) - but how?\n\n- The statistical model is only described in the Appendix (and even so inadequately, see below). Before seeing the appendix, we have no idea what predictors are being used, what coefficients are, etc. Yet these are constantly referred to in the rest of the text, and indeed constitute the main target quantities in the experiments! This is clearly not workable.\n\n- At no point is the statistical model clearly explained, with a clear description of all the predictors and coefficients and of what, exactly, is fit to the data as opposed to being hand-provided.\n\n- The authors simulate \"hungry, follower and random\" birds. How? (It's briefly discussed in the Appendix, which is not referred to in the main text).\n\n- As another example of the inadequate description, it is impossible to get a clear picture of what the proximity function (which is fundamental to the method)  actually looks like. How are the two sine waves and the exponential combined?\n\n- In 2.2.2, where the estimated values of certain parameters are reported, it doesn't tell us what is the true value of the parameters! The results show 0 effect of \"food trace\" in the communicators' case, and 0 for proximity in the non-communicators. Is that true in the simulation? That is not mentioned in the text.\n\n- What is a \"maximum projection of thermal images\"? \n\n- Figure 4 shows that various values of the preferred proximity parameter give rise to different fitted estimations for the proximity coefficient. This seems to be a very cumbersome way to approximately recover the true underlying proximity-preference function, which could probably better be done with a different parametrization (E.g. a polynomial times decaying exponential, which would allow the model to fit both the peaks and troughs of the proximity function with only a few more additional parameters?)\n\n- Generally, in the figures: \"Top\", \"Bottom\", \"Left\", \"Right\" is not sufficient (especially in combination). Label individual subplots with letters and reference these in the caption."

While foraging has been an objective of studies since the 70s, recently its focus has moved from lab experiments to (more) naturalistic behaviors of (groups of) animals interacting in the wild (or almost wild) conditions. In that regard, a computational framework to analyze data from such experiments is timely.\n\nThe Authors in this paper aimed to build a unified framework spanning several levels of analysis (i.e., cognitive, network, and algorithmic levels), which, I think, is especially important in the field of foraging because conventionally different levels of analysis were treated separately in the field.\n\nThe paper describes a new dataset and lays out the plans to collect more data using an even better technology. This is doubly valuable because new data will allow these and other researchers to test their models of foraging, and also, should additional data be needed to test new hypotheses, the Authors do have a set up framework in place to record such data.\n\nThe research is perfectly structured starting with the framework that unifies different levels of analysis, then using synthetic data to validate the framework, later applying the framework to existing data and reproducing the findings in a principled manner, and, finally, introducing new data and obtaining new knowledge off of it."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I have three small concerns/suggestions. They are intended to suggest some additional analyses, either for the time of the rebuttal (time permitting) or for future research.\n\nFirst, while the network level of analysis proposed here is indeed biologically plausible, there are no direct links to or mapping onto the brain at this point. An interesting future analysis may involve trying to establish such a mapping (although I do acknowledge that it\u2019s an extremely difficult task if one would like to go beyond high-level similarity). Some prior works have proposed models of how RL models may map onto the brain structure (e.g. see https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(12)00071-9 and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608002000473 ). It would be interesting to see how the weight matrices proposed in the current work would map onto these previous models and/or onto the brain in general).\n\nSecond, the study uses handcrafted features (\u201cproximity\u201d, \u201ctrace\u201d) to classify behaviors into handcrafted classes (\u201crandom\u201d, \u201chungry\u201d, \u201cfollower\u201d). While both the features and the classes considered here do make sense and are rooted in existing literature, they may mismatch the features and behavioral classes used by the animals and may end up being not expressive enough to describe the observed behavior. A possible way to account for that on the behavioral side is to build a low-dimensional representation of (all available) behavioral readouts and to run any (unsupervised) clustering algorithm on it (e.g. see https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(17)31604-4.pdf and references therein). On the feature side, a possible strategy is to train an RL model on all available inputs (and/or history thereof), then distill/deduce the relevant (parsimonious) variables (e.g. see https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/da97f65bd113e490a5fab20c4a69f586-Abstract.html )\n\nThird, and maybe that\u2019s something I\u2019ve overlooked, but, to my understanding, in the proposed model, as it currently stands, the communication between animals is modeled as a scalar spanning the range from 0 (no communication) to 1 (full reliance on communication). At the same time, animals may transmit signals of different content (e.g. food location vs food quantity); their reliance on the signals of different content may vary (e.g. paying attention to the food location but not to the quantity), and such reliance may be different across species. It looks like this is something that can be analyzed within the existing data and may strengthen the results by discovering the content of the messages passed and received by different species.\n\nWhile I think that the paper in its current standing is interesting and relevant, updates along the directions outlined above may further expand the scope of the results and strengthen this work."

It would be interesting to see how rodent foraging is different from avian foraging. Hopefully, these differences, combined with the overall knowledge of the conditions that the respective species are exposed to, would provide us additional information on the ways the environment shapes foraging strategies."

I did not completely get this from the section but according to the abstract, it seems that Bayesian inference is applied.\nFor example the sentence \"However, some birds also update their expected reward vector at the locations of other birds [...]\" could be interpreted in multiple ways, and it's not clear if some birds are modeled differently or if this behavior emerges from uniformly modeled birds. I think the paper would benefit from stating more clearly what was done and what the message of the paper is.\n\nI would also be very careful with formulations such as \"When animals decide what action to take, they sample their local environment\" or \"An animal at state S perceives not only the current state [...]\". While these models are often employed in the study of animals, it is unclear whether they represent the actual mechanisms at play in real animals."

                "value": "1. What is the primary contribution of the paper? Is it the introduction of different models, the exploration of their interrelations, or the approach to parameter inference? Do the experiments effectively validate this contribution?\n\n2. For the real-world dataset, has the accuracy of your model been measured? It would be beneficial to see a comparison between the simulated behavior and actual data. While inferring different proximity preferences among species is interesting, it doesn't provide insight into how well the model fits the data.\n\n3. When computing posterior distributions of the parameters, the model requires a stochastic component. How is the stochasticity of the agents modeled, particularly when the policy in the model appears deterministic?"
