                "value": "Neuroanatomical studies of populations often perform analyses on the cortical surface of the brain (imaged by MRI), with the brain represented by a mesh (or a mesh-inflated-to-a-sphere) enabling the study of local cortical shape thickness. Submission 6817 presents a framework for the fast extraction of cortical surfaces using supervised learning to match the performance of a conventional solver. \n\nIn current literature, a popular approach is to train a supervised UNet-style network output multiple deformation fields that iteratively warp a template mesh into the desired ground truth cortical surface (with the ground truth obtained by FreeSurfer or similar). Submission 6817 follows this approach but instead uses a recurrent UNet instead of an unrolled UNet. Experimentally, it focuses on supervised infant cortical surface extraction using data from the Baby Connectome Project."

                "value": "### No methodological or implementation details provided:\nAs presented, this paper is unreproducible and hard to evaluate as no implementation and low-level modeling details are provided. For example, there\u2019s no network architecture, no code, no details regarding dataset preprocessing (crucial to CSR), no details about data augmentation, how baselines were tuned, etc. The short implementation subsection lists learning rates, number of iterations, and loss weights, but spends the other half of its space describing instance normalization. \n\n**Suggestion:** As the submitted paper doesn\u2019t make it to the ICLR page limit (and there\u2019s unbounded supplementary space), please actually describe the framework and its details and also share code if possible.\n\n### ODE and iterative deformation contributions presented as novel:\nSection 3.2 presents the proposed ODE-based deformation formulation which is framed as a contribution. However, this appears to be the same formulation as used in most previous work on CSR (e.g., CortexODE, CortexFlow, etc.) with the only distinction being that a recurrent UNet is used instead of an unrolled UNet. \n\n**Suggestion:** Please detail how this specific contribution is non-trivially different from previous work and describe any specific innovations.\n\n### Baseline performance does not match trends reported in previous work:\nThe experiments show the proposed method widely outperforming well-established baseline methods such as Vox2Cortex and CorticalFlow++. However, these experimental trends are highly unexpected as previous work also on infant data show that the differences between methods are in the order of 0.01 mm whereas this paper reports differences of 1mm or more (for example, see table 1 in CoTAN, MICCAI\u201923 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11870.pdf). \n\nHow were these baselines implemented? Were their hyperparameters tuned on validation data ? If so, please add supplementary plots supporting this. Crucially, several of these methods start from an initial template cortical surface and not a sphere as in this method - were proper initial templates when these methods were run, or was a sphere used? If the latter, published hyperparameters for these methods will no longer transfer to the setting of this paper and need significant reworking for fair comparison. \n\n**Suggestion:** Please clarify these experimental differences w.r.t. other published work and describe in detail how the baselines were implemented and tuned.\n\n### Only a single dataset\nThe paper presents itself in the context of infant brain surface extraction which does not have many public datasets associated with it. However, none of the proposed methods in the submission are specific in any way to infants and could be directly applied to adults (in datasets such as HCP or ADNI) or neonates (e.g., the dHCP dataset). To actually evaluate the generalizability of the method, please include experiments on atleast one more dataset as is common in most papers in the subfield. \n\n**Suggestion:** If experimenting on another dataset is not possible, please explain why the method is specific to infants in the 0-8 mo. age range.\n\n### Overstretched claims\nThe paper makes some claims that are not well supported. For a few examples,\n- The introduction (para. 3) claims that papers based on graph convolutions such as Hoopes, et al and Bongratz, et al. do not generate topologically valid surfaces and require topology correction. This is untrue as both methods perform the same topologically-valid approach as the submission (deforming a template to a target) and do not require correction. \n- The paper claims that infant brain myelination (\u201ctissue contrast changes\u201d) poses a significant challenge to cortical surface reconstruction because of poor segmentation. However, this is only true in the unsupervised setting (e.g., using EM-style methods). As the paper trains its segmentor in a fully supervised manner, tissue segmentation is no more challenging than it is in adult brains as evidenced by all the work using the iSeg dataset.\n\n**Suggestion:** Please temper these claims."

This work is an incremental work based on the previous CSR methods, like CortexODE, Vox2Cortex, etc. Instead, this work utilized a more general sphere template, while other methods get the template from a mean shape or topology correction. Even though the author mentions that the sphere template is beneficial for spherical mapping, for the cortex reconstruction task, I don't see the advantage of using a sphere template for CSR. \n2. The recurrent framework is not novel, as it has been applied to medical image registration for a long time. Even though it might be the first time introduced into the CSR, it is not novel enough for ICLR. \n3. The proposed framework: template -> white surface -> pial surface, is pretty similar to CortexODE, with the change of using a sphere template and multiple-step surface reconstruction."
