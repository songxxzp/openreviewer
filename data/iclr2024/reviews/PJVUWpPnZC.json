Consider changing to \"In nature, the behavior\"\n- (Abstract) \"Automatically distilling these equations from limited data is cast as a symbolic regression (SR)\". This sentence is confusing. Symbolic Regression **is** the task of distilling equations from data. The sentence gives the impression that SR is something else and that the authors are using SR to solve that something else. Please clarify.\n- (Abstract) \"The discrete search space tends toward infinity\". This statement is not mathematically rigorous. The search space in SR (with variable length expressions) is always infinite. Do the authors mean the complexity of the search space? How do they measure it? Please clarify.\n- (Introduction) \"The early process of fitting expressions involves\". What do the authors mean by \"early process\"? Are they taking a historical perspective of the field? If so, please clarify.\n- (Introduction) \" By incorporating double Q- learning into MCTS, we effectively address issues of overfitting and generate new expressions\". How does Q-learning address overfitting? Please clarify. What do the authors mean with \"generate new expressions\"? Any other SR method is \"generating new expressions\" as well.\n- (Method) \" we introduce an interpolation method (e.g., data pre-processing)\". What do the authors mean by \"interpolation method\" and how is \"data pre-processing\" related to it? Please clarify.\n- (Method) \"the MSDB examines whether the few expressions that perform well adhere to a specific form. For instance, if both $\\exp(x) \u2212 x$ and $\\exp(x) + x$ yield favorable results, the expression can be confirmed as $\\exp(x) \u2212 f(x)$, thereby allowing us to focus on finding $f(x)$\" How do the authors determine what \"perform well\" means? I can understand the intuition of the authors: if both $\\exp(x) \u2212 x$ and $\\exp(x) + x$ yield favorable results, then the expression must be close to the middle of both expressions, i.e., $\\exp(x)$. However, it seems to me that how to determine the threshold in the fitting error to determine what \"perform well\" means is not clear. Is this threshold the same for all datasets? If not how is it determined? Please clarify.\n- (Method) \"This approach effectively reduces the difficulty associated with specific equations.\" This statement is not clear. Please clarify.\n- (Expression Tree) \"The underlying objective of SR is to transform the given task into the generation of an optimal expression tree\". This statement is not clear. Which task is SR transforming into the generation of an optimal expression tree? Please clarify.\n- (Modulated sub-tree discovery) \"This search form focuses on identifying expressions of the form like ex \u2212 x and ex + x.\" What do the authors mean by \"search form\"? Please clarify.\n- (Modulated sub-tree discovery) \"In this search form, we obtain good expressions such as 1.57ex and 1.56ex + x,\". The concept of \"search form\" and the use of \"..in this search form\" is not clear. Is search form a synonym of \"search space\"? Please clarify.\n- (Modulared sub-tree discovery) \"The complete from-discovery algorithm, \". There is a typo in \"from-discovery\". Please fix.\n- (Results) How many expressions were evaluated in each algorithm? Is this the same number for all algorithms? This is very important to assess the computational complexity of the algorithm proposed. Please clarify."
