                "value": "This paper is inspired by recent work on the \"dormant ratio\", a measure of how many neurons are inactive in a deep RL agent's neural net. Previous work (Sokar et al., 2023) showed that a high dormant ratio is detrimental to learning, but this paper flips things around by considering the converse, interpreting a declining dormant ratio as a proxy for learning progress. The authors propose three adaptive hyperparameter scheduling mechanisms based on this idea. They evaluate the resultant algorithm, named DrM, in three visual continuous control domains, where it performs more stably and achieves better asymptotic performance than three other recent methods."

DrM is the clear winner on *all* of the tasks reported on in the paper, and in some domains (particularly Adroit) it achieves a step change improvement. I like that the authors have considered three separate domains (DeepMind Control Suite, MetaWorld and Adroit), with multiple tasks from each.\n\nThe main idea of treating the dormant ratio as a progress proxy, and hence using it as the basis for adaptive hyperparameter scheduling, makes intuitive sense. While I have some minor qualms about the writing (see below), the paper was clear and easy-to-read overall. Lastly, the coverage of the huge amount of related work from the last 2-3 years is about as thorough as possible."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My biggests concerns with the paper are its limited novelty a lack of proper ablations.\n\nNovelty:\n\nNone of the three mechanisms introduced by DrM are novel in-and-of themselves.\n- As noted in the paper, \"dormant-ratio-guided perturbation\" follows the previous work of (D'Oro et al., 2023; Ash & Adams, 2020).\n- Similarly, \"dormant-ratio-guided exploitation\" is based on the work of Ji et al. (2023).\n- The idea of scheduling the exploration rate goes back a very long way, pre-dating deep RL. Some recent approaches, e.g., Agent57 (Badia et al.), also use a form of adaptive exploration.\n\nWhat *is* new is the idea of using the dormant ratio to schedule the hyperparameters of these methods. I don't disagree that this is novel; however, it's rather limited novelty in my opinion.\n\nAblations:\n\nWhile Figure 10 contains some ablations, the three mechanisms are each ablated in their entirety. I'd prefer it if only the adaptive scheduling component were ablated for each method, since this is the novel part. In other words, for a fair comparison, DrM ought to be compared against DrQ + perturbation resets (with fixed $\\alpha$) + \"Blended Exploration and Exploitation operator\" (with fixed $\\lambda$).\n\nMoreover, the ablations only consider one domain (Adroit) and the results are aggregated across all Adroit tasks. I'd prefer to see more ablations in greater granularity. For me, they're the most important part of the experiments, since without them it's very hard to understand *why* the improvements work. (The argument that DrM lowers the dormant ratio and hence improves performance seems very \"chicken-egg\" to me; it's unclear which is the cause and which is the effect. Only the dormant-ratio-guided perturbations seem to directly target the dormant ratio.)\n\nMinor things:\n- Section 3.1 is too unscientific, e.g., the claim \"This suggests that the dormant ratio acts as an intrinsic metric, influenced more by the diversity and relevance of the agent's behaviors than by its received rewards\". This is all based on one example, and the claim that RL agents learn relevant behaviours before their returns improve sounds dubious to me. Another too-bold claim is: \"As the dormant ratio captures the intrinsic characteristics of an agent's policy network, all the hyperparameters in this approach are robust to tasks and domains.\" This is never established, and in fact Table 1 in the Appendix suggests that some parameters of DrM require domain-specific tuning.\n- The claim in the abstract that DrM has \"no broken seeds (76 seeds in total)\" is a little vague (what constitutes \"broken\"?) and it's never really returned to in the main body of the paper."

                "value": "- The design choices going into the main method proposed by the paper are not given sufficient motivation, and I am concerned that although the algorith does indeed improve performance, it does not do so for the reasons claimed. In particular:\n        - Why is the method using shrink and perturb rather than directly resetting inactive units? Is it possible that S&P is introducing additional exploration due to the noisy updates to the parameters, similarly to the \"noisy nets\" strategy of Fortunato et al.?\n        - The exploration strategy appears to actually introduce *more* noise after the network is \"activated\" than it used before activation due to the max operator. However, the motivation for this noise adaptation is to introduce more noise early in training when the network's behaviours are less interesting. I agree that this should have the effect of increasing exploratory behaviour throughout training compared to using a schedule, but not in the way claimed by the paper.\n        - What motivates the modelling assumption that the network only becomes \"activated\" once in its training trajectory? Why is it assumed that the number of inactive units will not drop repeatedly?\n        - The use of expectiles introduces a large benefit in training based on the ablation study, but the optimal expectile seems to depend on the environment. Is there additional justification for using expectiles beyond the empirical benefit and the additional knob to tune in the training algorithm?\n- I have some concerns about the fairness of the comparisons employed in this work:\n        - Each of the components of the method seem to increase exploratory behaviour. However, the baselines compared against do not incorporate any particularly sophisticated exploration strategies (DrQv2 uses a linear scheduler and it doesn't look like A-LIX or TACO improve upon this). \n        - The proposed algorithm has a number of hyperparameters which have different optimal values for different environments. As a result, I'm not sure how much of the performance gain observed in the paper is due to finetuning of these additional hyperparameters vs the fundamental benefits of the method.\n        - Given the different optimal values of the expectile and perturbation scale for different environments, the robustness of the method to its hyperparameters is a major concern to me. How much worse is performance if the optimal hyperparameters for one domain are used in another?\n- While I appreciate the pseudocode provided in the appendix, there are some issues with clarity. For example, algorithm 2 says that one creates a deep copy of the network and stores this in the variable new_net, but then the next line randomly initializes the weights of new_net. What did the copy step do? Algorithm 1 lines 6-7 are also extremely vague and should be clarified with an equation.\n- Related to my concerns about design choices, there are many aspects of the algorithm that seem unnecessarily complicated -- for example, one could simply use an exploration noise value equal to the sigmoid of the dormant unit fraction discussed, or use a maximal exploration noise until the awakened threshold is met and then start the noise decay. I would appreciate ablations which illustrate the importance of these design choices.\n- The use of the term \"exploitation\" seems inaccurate to me. Exploitation is usually used to refer to greedy behaviour with respect to the network's predictions. In this case, exploitation refers more to optimistic Q-target updates which bias towards higher expectiles, encouraging the network to visit states which have occasionally yielded high rewards in the past. This approach would presumably lead to overestimation of Q-values in noisy environments and potentially result in suboptimal policies where the agent is attracted to high-variance, low-expectation states. I think the paper would benefit from a clearer discussion of what precisely this component of the method is doing, and potentially also a rebrand to characterize it more as a \"risk-seeking\" parameter rather than an \"exploitation\" parameter."

For example, why the method perturbs all units rather than resetting dead ones, why exploration noise is potentially greater later in training than earlier due to the max operator, and why the expectile method which is described as *exploiting* past success should have the effect of prioritizing high-variance states and thus correspond to greater *exploratory* behaviour?\n- How robust is the algorithm to the trajectory of dead units in networks trained on a particular environment? For example, if we considered a different architecture or set of tasks (perhaps ProcGen or Atari), would the strategies employed by the proposed method still provide the same benefit, or would they need to be re-tuned?"

                "value": "- The insight is derived from seemingly unrelated but recent work on Neuron\n  Dormancy, which explains how the phenomenon can impact learning in neural\n  networks through a potential plasticity mechanism. This paper seems to\n  provides a novel lens for the phenomenon, showing that neural activity can be\n  correlated with exploration, and that explicitly minimizing dormancy,\n  reinforcement algorithms can be improved in their ability to both explore and\n  'exploit'.\n- The paper is overall well written. The empirical analysis is good and,\n  although the statistical power is low due to a small sample size, the\n  improvements seem statistically significant. I particularly like that the\n  dormancy ratio is in-fact minimized, because the algorithm seems to be doing\n  this implicitly. The algorithm does seem to achieve SOTA on a few challenging\n  continuous control problems with relevant baselines. Overall, the\n  contributions are convincing."

                "value": "- The foundational motivation for dormancy ratio minimization is not entirely\n  convincing. It is not clear why high neuron dormancy should necessarily lead\n  to a decrease in exploration, even if this was empirically observed. It is\n  also not that clear why a lower neuron dormancy may lead to more exploration.\n  I think the paper would benefit from a more careful treatment of this finding,\n  either with further experiment, a toy model/study, theory or merely some text\n  describing why this should be expected.\n- There are a few aspects of the proposed algorithm that are mildly worrying.\n  First is the exploitation mechanism. I do not understand how exploitation is\n  determined by a hyperparameter controlling a value update towards a\n  state-value or an action-value. \n- The second thing is that the algorithm\n  proposes three mechansism, each with a hyperparmeter that governs a schedule.\n  This provides several degrees of freedom to improve upon the base algorithm,\n  and no hyperparameter study is conducted. This is not good empirical science,\n  but the empirical demonstration of success on hard problems does at least hold\n  promise for further work. \n\nOverall, I think the first and second weakness are both more pressing and addressable within a rebuttal period."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Section 3 (Language surrounding Dormant Ratio, specifically beginning of 3.2): While you demonstrate the empirial obervation that low neuron dormancy is correlated with meanginful high-level behavior, it is overclaiming to say that it is essential. I can imagine an approach to construct a neural network with an arbitrarily high dormancy ratio by encapsulating any policy within a much larger but inactive network. Thus, it is not necessarily the case that high dormancy ratio translates to less meaningful behavior, but that it can be correlated with it during training.\n- Section 3 (Expectile Regression and Exploitation): This section seems to build off recent work, and I am not familiar with \"blended exploitation and exploration\". However, I do not see how the proposed method has anything to do with exploitation. Exploitation and exploration are fundamentally about control and action, but this section is primarily about the target of a temporal difference method. But even putting that aside, I do not see why placing higher weight on the state value function should empahsize exploitation, or why placing higher weight on the action value function should emphasize exploration.\n- Section 3 (Hyperparameters): The method involves three components, each with at least one hyperparameter. This gives your proposed algorithm a number of additional degrees of freedom over the base algorithm and the other baselines. Looking at the experiments, there is an ablation study for each individual component but no results on the sensitivity to the various hyperparameters. It would have been good to explore this, at least in one of the simpler environments.\n- Section 4 (Dormant ratio analysis): Validating the fact that the dormancy ratio is indeed minimized vs the base algorithm is interesting. One thing that would strengthen these results further is to show that the other baselines (A-LIX, TACO) are similar to DrQ-v2 in that they do not minimize the dormancy ratio on at least some problem. It would also be interesting to investigate why there is some periodicity in the dormancy ratio such as in humanoid run and manipulator.\n- Section 4 (Ablation study): I appreciate the effort to ablate your algorithm in Adroit, a relatively complex environment. One thing that would help is to show whether each component of DrM is faithful to its motivation. For example, the exploration mechanism could be shown to have a large influence on performance in environments that require exploration and less influence on environments that do not require as much exploration. This would also serve as an opportunity to further elaborate on what the exploitation mechanism accomplishes.\n\n# Minor\n- Section 2 (visual RL): Is it necessarily the case that your setting is POMDP and that the observations provided to the agent lack some information? While this can be true in some settings, the environment is usually constructed so that the observatiosn do include all necessary information (e.g. concatenation of frames in Atari).\n- Section 2 (Dormant Ratio): You use the term \"Linear layer\" in both definitions, but I am not sure whether this is required in the definition or what it is that you mean. Does it mean the last layer that usually maps the penultimate activations to the output?"
