                "value": "The paper proposes an approach (GraphPulse) for learning on Discrete Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDGs). GraphPulse relies on the mapper method (a Topological Data Analysis technique used to compress high dimensional data in a small and comprehensible graphical representation) to extract latent topological properties of each graph snapshot. More in detail, provided a sequence of graphs (G_1, G_2, \u2026, G_N), for each graph G_i, the authors extract a finite set of \u201csnapshot\u201d features describing the general properties of G_i (i.e. the\nnumber of nodes, the number of edges, and the average value of edge weights). They then proceed at computing for G_i a compact graphical representation using the mapper method, and from the obtained graph they extract 5 new \u201cmapper\u201d features (the number of nodes, the number of edges, the maximum cluster size, the average cluster size, and the average value of edge weights). The snapshot and mapper features of each graph are then fed in input to a sequential model (LSTM+GRU), which outputs a prediction for the sequence of graphs. To evaluate their method, the authors defined a network growth problem where they aim at predicting whether a given network in a future interval will show more edges than in the past or not."

                "value": "While I found the manuscript rather interesting and generally well presented, in some parts I had some difficulties completely understanding the paper. For instance, in Section 3, the clustering method is not really introduced in the mapper method and I found it difficult at first to understand the role that this would have in the overall approach. Similarly, in the experimental section I did not find details on what clustering algorithm or lens function the authors used for computing the Mapper Network (edge weights for the mapper network and mapper hyperparameters in Section 6 are also not defined in the paper). I would greatly appreciate it if the authors could provide some details in their rebuttal on this to clarify my understanding of their paper (and in general improve readability).\n\nFor what concerns the experimental evaluation, the results look promising, however I wonder if using a GIN as a static GNN baseline might not be fair. The goal of the model is to predict whether in a future window of time there will be more edges in the graph than in the past. As such, being able to understand whether the network is growing in size (or not) over time seems a priori a meaningful feature for the model. This information can however not be captured with a GIN, as the only features this has access to are: Outgoing EdgeWeight Sum, Incoming EdgeWeight Sum, Outgoing Edge Count, and Incoming Edge Count; which do not describe such evolution. For this reason I wonder if decorating edge features with the timestamp associated to the time when an edge appears and using an architecture able to compute graph embeddings based on edge features (e.g. a MPNN) could be a better baseline for the given prediction task."

            "questions": {
                "value": "I found it interesting that the authors handcrafted a feature descriptor for both a snapshot and the mapper network. While reading the paper I was expecting to see a GNN for extrapolating graph-wise features that would have then been used in input to the recurrent model. This would have provided (ignoring the construction of the mapper network with a fixed lens function) an end-to-end learnable approach that would have indeed suited a generic classification problem. I wonder if the authors have experimented with such a solution in their experiments and whether this could provide a further boost in performance."

In my opinion, the overall structure and the connections between nodes are more crucial and directly effective in the process of learning dynamic graphs. I would suggest the authors to incorporate the connection information into the model.\n\nW2. The current assessment of the graph property focuses on determining whether there is a rise or decline in the number of edges, resulting in a fairly limited perspective. I would suggest the authors utilize more comprehensive graph properties to evaluate model capabilities on temporal graphs, such as changing node counts, density, diameter, degree distribution, and the number of triangles. Additionally, rather than binary classification, predicting the specific number of increased/decreased edges would test a finer-grained understanding of edge dynamics."
