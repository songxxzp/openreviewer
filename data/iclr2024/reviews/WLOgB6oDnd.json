They start by training a \"teacher\" model, which learns to make predictions using both the free-text explanations and task inputs. This helps the teacher model absorb the knowledge from the free-text explanations into its hidden state. Next, they build a \"student\" model and make sure its hidden state aligns with the teacher's, all without directly using the free-text explanations. They then put their models to the test on two question-answering tasks, comparing them to various baseline models with different fine-tuning and initialization approaches. Impressively, their models outperform these baselines. Additionally, they carry out an ablation study to understand how different parts of their model contribute to its success."

How does this approach compare favorably to \"retrieve-augmented-generation,\" a method that initially retrieves relevant knowledge, such as free-text rationales, and then enhances the input with this retrieved knowledge?\n3. Why does incorporating the free-text rationale during the teacher model's fine-tuning enhance the student model's performance? It's possible that the improvement shown in Figure 3(a) is due to the extra knowledge contained in the free-text rationale, which could be beneficial for the downstream tasks. This improvement, while not substantial, might not generalize well to scenarios with less overlap in knowledge or when using larger free-text rationales for teacher model fine-tuning. This raises questions about the broader applicability of this approach."

Then, the hidden states of the encoder and output prediction distribution are used in knowledge distillation, transferring knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. Experimental results indicate that KNIFE is effective compared to the fine-tuning variants thanks to the knowledge distillation of both hidden states and output distribution."

                "value": "- **Limited Contribution;** While I acknowledge the novelty and design of the prospoed method aimed at distilling reasoning knowledge from free-text rationales in encoder-decoder LMs, its contribution appears limited for several reasons:\n    - The efficacy of the proposed method, KNIFE, seems marginal as the improvements are not statistically significant based on some results in Table 1. For instance, in the StrategyQA dataset, KNIFE\u2019s performance is comparable to FT (I\u2192RO), suggesting that simple fine-tuning of the language model with FTR and using the answer as the target yields results similar to KNIFE. Additionally, the experimental results suggest that distilling from T5-Large to T5-Base is less effective than from T5-Base to T5-base, which is weird.\n    - The application scope of the proposed method is restricted both in task type and language model architecture. It\u2019s only suitable for multi-choice QA tasks when free-text rationales are available and is exclusive to LMs with encoder-decoder architecture like T5, making it unsuitable for decoder-only models like Llama.\n    - The individual contributions of each component in the proposed method remain ambiguous. In Tables 8 and 9, KNIFE with either KD-in loss only or KD-out loss only occasionally outperforms KNIFE with both objectives combined. This raises the question: is employing both objectives truly advantageous?\n- **Limited significance of the Problem;** Lately, there have been significant works [1,2,3] into distilling the reasoning ability of large LMs (e.g., Llama-2 or GPT-3.5-turbo) into smaller LMs. Given this context, how does the proposed method compare to existing approaches? In Appendix A.1., the authors posit that their method is advantageous when large-scale LMs lack reasoning abilities, a premise that seems out of sync with current trends in large language models.\n\n[1] Ho et al., Large language models are reasoning teachers, ACL 2023 \n\n[2] Magister et al., Teaching small language models to reason, ACL 2023\n\n[3] Fu et al., Specializing smaller language models towards multi-step reasoning, ICML 2023"
