In general, I would think this assumption may not necessarily be true in several settings. For example, it has been widely proved that deep learning models are poorly calibrated. Based on this, I would suggest (1) additional experiments on the calibration error on current IN-distribution test data (2) additional limitation section about this point. \n- About gradient norm detection. Using gradient norm as a detector can be novel in OOD detection. While this might not be sufficiently novel in border distribution shift related papers. For example, paper [1-3] discussed the role of gradient norm/flow in meta-learning, algorithmic fairness and domain adaptation. It can be great if additional discussion is done in border distribution shift related topics. \n- About the pseudo labels in the test data. I agree this is generally a non-trivial task because we never know the calibration property of deep neural-network. I was wondering two alternative scenarios (1) if we use random labels (2) we compute the average on all labels. \n- Based on the assumption it seems a scoring detector is a sufficient estimator. I.e, a higher gradient score should be OOD and not vice versa (because it depends on the data variance, in your toy example). What do you think about sufficient and necessary conditions in estimating OOD errors? \n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Generalization Bounds For Meta-Learning: An Information-Theoretic Analysis.

Inspired by the relationship between the gradient information and the generalization ability within the deep neural network, the authors proposed a novel approach to solve the OOD error estimation problem by leveraging the magnitude of the gradient. Specifically, by analyzing the fine-tuning process of a pre-trained model on the new test data, the authors showed that the gradient information is crucial for OOD error prediction. Then, a novel statistic, named GRDNORM Score, was proposed by calculating the vector norm of the gradient of the last layer through one-step backpropagation, under a confidence-based pseudo-labeling policy. With the empirical evaluations on different datasets, network architectures, and distribution shifts, the proposed method showed its effectiveness and efficiency for OOD error prediction."

This work provides another viewpoint to build the relationship between the OOD performance and test data, under a data-centric perspective. The proposed method also showed the advantage of the computational overhead.\n3. The motivation is clear and reasonable.

                "value": "1. Discussion about the pseudo-label generation process. In Eq. (5), the authors proposed to apply a threshold $\\tau$ to control the confidence-based label generation process. In my understanding, if we set too small values for this hyperparameter, it seems we will assign a determined pseudo-label even for less confident samples. In contrast, using too large values for $\\tau$ can be viewed as discarding more information in this process. Here are my questions:\n\n    - 1.1. How did the authors choose a proper threshold $\\tau$ in this process? I did not find any discussion or analysis for this in the main body or the appendix. But I believe the choice of this threshold does matter for the final performance.\n\n    - 1.2 About the low-confidence case. In Eq.(5), if the maximum probability predicted by the model is still lower than a threshold $\\tau$, the authors proposed to assign a random label from the label space. Is this process reasonable and can it be replaced by other methods? For example, if we set $\\tau=0.5$ and a sample is predicted with  $f_{\\theta} (\\mathbf{x}_{i})=[0.1,0.4,0.35,0.15]$  in a four-way classification scenario. If we adopt the label-generation strategy in this paper, we should randomly generate pseudo-label from the label space $\\mathcal{Y}=${0,1,2,3}. \n\nHowever, even though the maximum probability $0.4< \\tau=0.5$, we can still observe that the model tends to predict $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ into Class {1,2} with higher probabilities. Thus, will we discard too much information if we naively select a random label within the whole label space? And I guess there are other ways to deal with low-confidence samples. For example:\n\n(a) randomly generate pseudo labels from the top-$K$ largest confidences, e.g., generating from $\\mathcal{Y}^{\\prime}=${1,2} rather than the full label space $\\mathcal{Y}=${0,1,2,3}; \n\n(b) directly adopt the pseudo label $[0.1,0.4,0.35,0.15]$ for this low-confident sample. \n\n2. It seems that a recent work [1] was missed in the comparisons between the proposed method and the baselines. In that work, the confidence and the disperity of the prediction matrix on the test dataset were considered for OOD error estimation and the nuclear norm was adopted to predict the OOD error. Could the authors provide comparisons between the proposed method and this work, both in terms of estimation performance and computational efficiency?\n\n3. Some typos. For example:\n- After Equation (2),  $\\mathbf{s}_{k}$ should be  $\\mathbf{s}_{w}^{k}$ be for a consistent expression;\n- Before Equation (3), $\\mathcal{D}_{test}=\\{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\}_{i=1}^{m}$ should be $\\mathcal{D}_{test}=\\{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}_{i}}\\}_{i=1}^{m}$\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Deng et al.
