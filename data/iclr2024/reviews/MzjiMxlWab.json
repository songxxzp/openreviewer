This work is based on an existing work that learns prototypical representation of items and users that seperate items into different groups. This work further incorporates disentangled representation learning to explore item representations of various aspects of items, which has been also considered in previous works[1]. \nThe main difference appears to be  the combination of these various aspects.\n2. Figure 2 is confusing because it takes explicit user-item interaction in an rating form. However, the paper is designed based on implicit user-item interaction. This misleads the reader on the output form and training strategy of the proposed method. \n3. Would it be better to include item attribute information in prototype learning as auxiliary information? Without low-level attributes as input, the so-called low-level user interest about a facet might also be a composite feature of some facets. This could result in the difference in meaning between the two levels of interests not being clear.\n4.  More qualitative analysis and case studies about on how learned latent representations corresponds to different aspects of characteristics may help to better evaluate the interpretability of the model. For example, more details on how the \"latent interest\" corresponds to explicit interests 1, 2, and 3 in Table 4 would be appreciated.\n\n[1] Learning Disentangled Representations for Recommendation"
