Is it for a single layer or multiple layers?\n\n\"We assume that a node i on a layer /alpha can be connected to at most one node j on another layer /beta, i.e., the two nodes represent the same unit of the system\" do the authors mean node i and node j is the same node?\n\n\"N1 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+ NL = N\" N_i and N_j may have overlapping nodes, right?\n\nDoes horizontal network for multiple edge types for a set to nodes and vertical network is a set of cross edges among different layers. I have research experience on the graph construction but I am almost lost by the description. It's recommended to illustrate the abstract definition with a toy graph or from a real-would example. For example two people can build relationships via multiple social media, e.g. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok... Then explain where are the horizontal and vertical subnetworks in the example.\n\n\nD2. \"Equations 1 use the convolutional layer as described in the GAT model\" (Page 3)? Does the convolutional layer refer to the unit block in GCN? One of the main difference between GCN and GAT is the aggregation mechanism (auto-weighted vs unweighed). Can GAT layer be considered as a convolutional layer? Any reference?\n\n\nD3. An interesting question is that how many MPXGAT-H layers needed before forwarding node embedding to MPXGAT-V, and vice versa. The authors seems not mention the detail. Is the default as 1 MPXGAT-H -> 1 layer MPXGAT-V -> 1 layer MPXGAT-H...? Then how many rounds of H-V block needed? \n\nD4. A simple baseline is applying a single-layer graph embedding method (e.g., DeepWalk, Node2vec, LINE, GCN, GAT, and etc) and concate them via multiple graph layers to do link prediction\n\nD5. It's easy to observe that GATNE performs clearly better for intra-layer task than others (including the proposed one). But why? The authors doesn't analyze the reason\n\n========================\n\nI acknowledge that I have read the authors response. I appreciate the authors effort. But it didn't address my concerns.

Does predicting inter-layer connections in multiplex networks mean alignment of entities and so equivalent to graph alignment problem? Why link prediction in heterogeneous graphs cannot be used for predicting the inter-layer connections? That is, one can consider a multiplex network as a special case of heterogeneous graphs and then apply link prediction methods in heterogeneous graphs, which can both predict inter-layer and intra-layer links. \n\n2. There is a lack of discussion with many important and relevant studies. For example [1, 2, 3] also use attention modules to learn the node encodings in multiplex graphs. How this GAT-based approach is different from these attention modules and how it can be compared with them? It would be better if the authors could provide a detailed discussion on this. In addition to these methods, as mentioned above, it would be better if the authors could discuss heterogeneous graph-learning methods [4, 5].\n\n3.  The model design is a simple application of GAT on multiplex networks, and I believe the contribution to the model design is not novel and somehow incremental. \n\n4.  The experiments show that GATNE, which is not state-of-the-art for link prediction in heterogeneous graphs, can outperform the proposed method in intra-layer link prediction. Based on this result, it seems that the only application of the proposed method is inter-layer link prediction, which has unclear motivation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ $ \n$ $\n\n1.
