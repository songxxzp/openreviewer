The authors, first noted the various \u201cmoving parts\u201d of modern reverse process solver and then applied an evolution-based search technique to explore these while keeping track of FID under an NFE budget. Authors argued and validated that a non-uniform combination of these design choices in different timesteps is the key to reach optimal \u201csolver schedule\u201d. A lot of experiments are conducted to search through this space of solver schedules. In fact, they also proposes a special evolutionary search method S3 that does it more efficiently."

While I agree that figuring out good FID numbers for existing benchmarks is pretty good, it is not usually preffered to lock the contribution to very specific models/dataset/solver. If a new dataset/model/solver comes out in future, one need to perform the entire search again.\n- The USF isn\u2019t really something new. It is just a \u201cdumb\u201d aggregation of a bunch of design options. It is only based on empirical evidence \u2014 but I wonder if it can be theoretically justified."

Is the paper supposed to be about the \u201csearch algorithm S3\u201d or an empirical AutoML report ?\n- If your focus is S3, there is surprisingly little written about it in the main paper. Almost all details are in supplementary. So that indicates it to be just an AutoML experimental report \u2014 is it ?\n- Outright confession: I am not at all experienced in AutoML. So, is this S3 something novel or it is a usual practice in AutoML ? I don\u2019t see any proper citation in case this has been adopted from existing literature/libraries.\n- What exactly the paper \u201cconcludes\u201d at the end the day \u2014 did you find any \u201cpattern\u201d in the optimal solver schedules that may motivate further work? I don\u2019t see the exact configuration of the optimal solver schedules (found by S3) \u2014 are they written anywhere? You can certainly report the ones with low NFE. This is important for verifying them later on by others.\n\nCouple of high-level points are unclear to me; so I am now going with a \u201cbelow threshold\u201d rating. I am open to increasing it depending on authors response, if satisfactory."

Under the framework, these methods can be represented with different options on some strategies and hyperparameters.\nThis paper shows the phenomenon that different solver strategies at different timesteps may yield different performances. This paper is inspired to design a schedule between different solving strategies during the sampling based on the unified framework. In this paper, the predicator-based method is proposed to schedule the solvers, which outperforms the SOTA solvers on several conditional datasets."

USF: This paper unifies the existing DPM solvers under a framework with detailed derivations and analysis, which provides a new perspective to review the DPM solvers and improve their performance in real applications.\n2. $S^3$: This paper proposes the $S^3$ method which uses light predictors to search the solver schedule which demonstrates good performance on unconditional datasets with limited NEF.\n3. Empirical Results: This paper has plentiful empirical studies. It demonstrates the situation that there is no single best solver under different timesteps. It also shows good performance compared with baselines and ablation studies on the consumption of generated images."

The proposed method paper may lack motivation.\n2. This paper may lack novelty and contributions in the sense that it does not provide a further understanding of why suitable solvers are different on different timesteps. \n3. On empirical results, this paper may lack the results when the NFE is larger than 10. The gap between the baselines and the proposed method may decrease with larger NFE."

Since the search method also has the time consumption, can you provide some experiment results on it?\n3. Can you give a brief explanation of the meaning and effect of multi-stage in Algorithm 2?\n4. Since the USF can include the method DEIS in the domain $t$, why do you not include this method as a baseline in experiments?\n\nHere are some typos in App. D. In analyzing the current solvers, the index of $\\tilde{x}_{i-1}$ may be incorrect.\n\nThey should be $t_{i-1}$ in DPM-Solver-2, DPM-Solver++(2S) and DPM-Solver++(2M). \n\nWhen using the Assumption in the Appendix, it may not be Thm A.1, A.2 etc."
