Without proper explanation and discussion, it is hard to claim that \u201cThis is the general case of real-world OOD graphs.\u201d\n- What does the superscript $e$ means in $A^e$? How environment changes could affect the generation of X?\n- Moreover, the failure proofs seem to heavily rely on the assumption that \u201cGNNs that are sufficiently deep (deeper than the number of layers of the causal pattern of a node) are typically used.\u201d. Is it really true? \n\n2. The novelty of the proposed method is limited and some related works have not been fairly discussed. \n- The proposed method is a simple modification of Mahajan et al. (2021). How does the modification work to make up the environment information? \n- If it\u2019s only for the collapse issue, as already demonstrated in Figure 1, properly tuning the hyperparameter $\\lambda$ already solves the problem well. How the $\\lambda$ is tuned for CIA? \n- What\u2019s the relation between LoRe-CIA and CIA? Does CIA serve as a upper bound for LoRe-CIA? Why not incorporating LoRe into CIA with environments directly to resolve the collapse issue?\n- What is the exact implementation of LoRe-CIA?\n- The failures of IRM and VRex, and the success of intra-class contrastive learning are not surprising, as they are already shown by Chen et al., (2022). It is desirable to properly discuss the distinctions of the work with respect to previous works, thus the readers could better understand the place of the work in the literature.\n\n3.

                "value": "1.  The setting in 3.1 assumes $L > 2k$ and GNNs are sufficiently deep, which is doubtful. Typically graph tasks would not use very deep GNNs due to the well-known fact that deep GNNs have over-smoothing issues and compromise performances. Therefore this assumption may not hold. Moreover, there's no validation for the number of layers of the causal pattern of a node in any real-world dataset, thus no conclusion whether this $L > 2k$ setting is applicable for any graph tasks.\n\n2. From my understanding, CIA's major superiority over other methods using environment labels like VREx roots in its consideration of both class and environment label information at the same time. However, LoRe-CIA does not use environment labels. According to [1], learning invariant/spurious features without environment partition is fundamentally impossible if not given further inductive biases or information. Thus, there appears to be no guarantee that LoRe-CIA can learn the information supporting CIA, i.e., LoRe-CIA might not be able to identify node pairs with significant differences in spurious features and small differences in causal features.\n\n3. Sec 4.2 assumes 1. change rate of node\u2019s spurious features w.r.t spatial location is faster than that of the causal feature; 2. label distribution of node's different-class neighbors reflects the distribution of spurious features. This assumption is quite strong and seems not applicable widely. There are graphs exhibiting various behavior, such as heterogeneous/homogeneous graphs. Further discussions on when these assumptions hold should be included.\n\n\n[1] ZIN: When and How to Learn Invariance Without Environment Partition?"

For instance, in Figures 1 and 2, the shapes representing labels are hard to tell at the first sight. In Section 4.2, the statement \"the rate of change of a node\u2019s spurious features with respect to spatial location on the graph is faster than that of the causal feature\" could benefit from a more specific explanation of what \"rate\" means in this context. Additionally, while the content is generally clear, the writing could be further refined.\n\n- **Real-world graph datasets**: Since CBAS is a synthetic dataset, its weight in the study may be smaller than the other two datasets.
