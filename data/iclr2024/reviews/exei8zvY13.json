The methodological contribution is an alternative to conventional patching in training, where the authors first separated the cerebellum from the entire brain. Next, they generate patches from the complete brain volume, selecting half of them at random. Concurrently, patches were produced from the cerebellum dataset until their count equaled that of the whole brain volume patches. Finally, patches from both sources were combined in a random manner. These steps are repeated at each epoch. \n\nIn experiments, the authors show improved results on the cerebellum."

Results indicate that the CNN and GAN based models used can still work with a lower resolution image it is typically trained on, and balancing the patch portions can increase the accuracy in the cerebellum with small effect on the cerebrum."

While they claim that using 6.25% of the k-space is closer to real life low resolution images, they do not provide any evidence to prove their claim. They also aim to argue the generalizability of the model on a lower resolution than previous works. However, for this to be investigated, various scales of k-space should be considered and experimented on. The effect of removing a portion of the k-space should also be discussed, since the lower the resolution, the model has to synthesize more information, which could be critical when dealing with detailed, or subject varying structures.\n\nRegarding solving the imbalance of patches, if patches are created after extracting the cerebellum through segmentation, there will be a complete loss of patches that has an overlap between the cerebrum and the cerebellum. There should be some explanation or discussion on this issue. Also, even though they did mention that there should be more investigation than using just a 50-50 balancing scheme, such work should be included in the main work. Since this is an analysis on how to create the patches, an analysis/investigation on the size of patches should be included as well. Since we have the previous question, how the resolution of the inputs affect this experiment should be looked into.\n\nFinally, even though the introduction and related work section clearly mentions transformer based models, there is no analysis on such models or any explanation of why only CNN and GAN based models were used for analysis.\n\nOverall, while both topics investigated by the authors are important, both analysis are incomplete and lack reasoning behind several factors used/effected in the experiments."

It is well known in the machine learning community that increasing under-represented samples results in improved performance for those categories. This shortcoming can not be fixed within the review period.\n- The authors took out-of-the-box super-resolution architecture and only experimented with the sample augmentation strategy, which does not suffice for ICLR publication.\n- My suggestion to the authors is to polish the manuscript by clearly emphasizing the importance of cerebellum super-resolution and showing its use case in clinical application. It could be an interesting publication in a medical venue such as Medical Image Analysis, MELBA, or similar other journals.\n- It is not clear why row one of Table 1 has HR & LR and the other rows have HR & SR. Also, what is the Baseline model? Zero filling in k-space?\n- Figure 4. seems to have a major bug. The HR and SR image columns look identical. Authors should check that with care."
