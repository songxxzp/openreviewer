They propose Simple Data Sharing (SDS) which can provably solve CGO problems by utilizing (1) an unsupervised dataset of transitions and (2) a dataset which additionally includes context-goal pairs. SDS first defines an action-augmented MDP which resolves the inconsistent dynamics in the two datasets and where the optimal policies are also optimal in the original CGO. Then, they propose a data augmentation technique for integrating the two datasets in a principled manner, where this process can be used as a preprocessing step before running offline RL algorithms. Their approach is evaluated on AntMaze."

While I appreciate that the authors were open about the limited experiments, I think comprehensive experiments are something necessary to establish the strength of SDS rather than it being a \u201cinteresting future direction\u201d As a comparison, MAHALO considers more settings on MuJoCo (D4RL datasets) as well as MetaWorld.\n2. While it is true that unsupervised datasets such as task-agnostic play data can be easier to obtain than supervised datasets, SDS requires the dynamics of the dataset to cover goal-reaching trajectories. This is essentially suggesting that SDS always requires optimal trajectories, since we can just add a goal-reaching indicator at the last step of that trajectory even if it is unsupervised initially. This assumption may not scale to more complex GCRL problems if the goals are harder to reach and only near-optimal agents can achieve that goal.\n3. The introduction motivates SDS by claiming that Offline GCRL algorithms such as GoFar (Ma et, al. 2022) \u201ccan fail when the predicted goal is not reachable from the initial state.\u201d However, this claim is also not evaluated in the experiments. Overall, there are a lack of baselines which were included in the related work section but not compared in the experiments. \n4. Similarly, MAHALO was not considered as a baseline for the experiments although it was compared to SDS in the theoretical results.\n5. While the theoretical results in Theorem 3.1 are nice,  it is not immediately clear what the novel contributions are. While I am not too familiar with the literature on statistical RL and I may be missing something, I think the authors should be explicit about what novel techniques are used to extend theorems from previous work, especially if the theoretical results are the main contribution of the paper.\n6.

I doubt the coexistence of separate unsupervised data and context-goal data might not be so difficult to combine. For example, in the navigation setting mentioned by the authors, it is easy to derive a goal position from the actual state and vice versa. With a predefined context distribution, we can label a state accomplishing a given context as the goal state with ease.\n2. In Section 3.1, the authors see the key problem that \"some $s\\in G_c$ in the $D_\\text{goal}$ dataset is also observed in the dynamics dataset.\" However, I speculate that the process of Algorithm 1 cannot tackle this issue as the transition of a goal state $x$ to $x'$ where $x' \\neq x^+$ will still remain. The problem can only be alleviated with the mentioned apporach of \"equally balancing the samples $\\bar{D}_\\text{dyn}$ and $\\bar{D}_\\text{goal}$\" (in section 3.2). \n3. A confusing point is that the authors provide theoretical analysis on SDS+PSPI but do not use this variant for experiments (they use SDS+IQL instead).\n\nSome minor issues:\n\n1. In Line 7 of Algorithm 1, should the created transition here be incorperated with $a$ rather than $a^+$? Otherwise I do not observe any usage of $a$ from unsupervised data.\n2. In the \"data assumption\" part of Section 2, the definitions between $\\mu_\\text{dyn}(s, a, s')$ and $\\mu_\\text{dyn}(s' \\mid s, a)$, and between $\\mu_\\text{goal}(s, c)$ and $\\mu_\\text{goal}(s \\mid c)$ seem to be abused."

What is the applicable domain of CGO problems? As mentioned in the weaknesses, why can't we relabel the unsupervised data for a targeted task as the context can be usually derived from the state, since the context $c$ in this setting remains unchanged? I may foresee an issue that this derivation may not be easy for language instructions. However, texts as contexts are not involved in the experiments. The authors also mention that they can use \"an oracle function to tell whether a state is within the goal set\" (in Section 4.1).\n3. Why do the experiments replace 0/1 rewards with -1/0 rewards? Are they intrinsically different or empirically different?\n4. Why not use the theoretically sound SDS+PSPI method for experiments?\n5. I'm confusing about the reward prediction approach adopted to the baselines. How can we train a reward model with only using postive data (from $D_\\text{goal}$)? For the usage of the reward model, can you ellaborate the meaning of \"choosing the percentile as 5% in the reward distribution evaluated by the context-goal set as the threshold to label goals\" in Appendix C.1?\n6. In Section 4.3, what is the reason for the observation that \"for PDS, we can observe that the reward distribution for positive and negative samples are better separated in the large one than the medium one?\"\n7. What are main differences among the three experimental settings (from Section 4.3 to 4.5)?

                "value": "**MAJOR**\n\n1- **Theory**:\n\n  - The theoretical assumptions seem imprecise or incorrect. For example, the authors say that the state, action, and context spaces can be continuous. If they are continuous (say $|\\mathcal{A}|=|\\mathcal{S}|=|\\mathbb{R}|$), then $|\\Pi|$ is extremely large (e.g contains $|\\mathcal{A}|^{|\\mathcal{S}|}=\\aleph_1^{\\aleph_1}$ deterministic policies). In this case $\\epsilon_{dyn}$ will be extremely large, making the RHS of the bound in Theorem 3.1 extremely large.\n\n  - If I understand Theorem 3.1 correctly, then the right-hand side of the bound is almost always greater than $V_{max}=\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$ (since the rewards are only non-zero at goal states and are 1 otherwise). Since this would make the bound useless, I am probably misunderstanding the meaning of each term on the RHS. It would have been helpful if the authors explained step-by-step each term of the bound and how that leads to a small regret with high probability (maybe using an example domain)\n\n  - The motivation for why Algorithm 1 is expected to work is not given, which makes it hard to get an intuition for its general applicability. In fact, the algorithm looks like it shouldn't work, since it gives zero rewards for all states in $D_{dyn}$, potentially including goal states that were given rewards of 1 in $D_{goal}$. It is not clear why this reward scheme makes sense.\n\n  - The presentation of the theoretical results is very poor (mainly Section 3.3). \n\n    - There is barely any explanation of what the Theorem, Assumptions, and Definitions are saying. For example, Definition 3.4 defines \"generalized concentrability\" out of the blue and does not explain what it is saying and how it is relevant. It is also not clear why it uses the same symbols that were defined for just \"concentrability\" in Theorem 3.1.\n\n    - Some symbols or functions like $a^+$, $g$, $\\mathcal{F}$, and $\\mathcal{G}$ are defined but not explained. What are they supposed to represent? For example, I am assuming $a^+$ represents a terminating action similar in behavior to terminating sets in Options. For another example, Theorem 3.1 suggests $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{G}$ are sets of value functions, but Assumption 3.2 suggests $\\mathcal{G}$ is a set of reward functions. It is also not clear what $R$ in this assumption is (I am just assuming it is a reward function). It is also unclear what MDP $Q^\\pi$ and $R$ are defined for in this assumption. \n\n    - There is a general sense of scattered explanations that makes the paper hard to read. For example, Section 3.3 jumps straight into Theorem 3.1 which is about SDS + PSPI without even explaining PSPI. Only after is PSPI explained in Section 3.3.1.  \n\n\n2- **Experiments**:\n\n  - All the experiments are in a single domain (the D4RL AntMaze). While the 3 variations in goal distributions are useful, comparisons with baselines in other domains (e.g another D4RL domain) would have helped get a better sense of the general applicability of the proposed approach \n\n  - The paper reports means and standard deviations over only 5 seeds. These are not enough to support the strong empirical claims of the paper.\n\n3- **Related Works**:\n\n  - There is no related works section in the main paper. I think moving the related works to the appendix is going a bit too far. The related works section is important to contextualise the contributions of this work in relevant literature properly. At least a brief related works section could have been included in the main paper (leaving the expanded version for the appendix).\n\n3- **Limitations**:\n  \n  - The proposed approach is only applicable to goal-conditioned tasks with rewards of 1 only at goal states and zero rewards otherwise.\n\n  - The paper makes very strong assumptions about the offline dataset. Mainly, they assume that the goals dataset ($D_{goal}$) contains all the goals the agent will encounter and that the trajectories dataset ($D_{dyn}) contains trajectories leading to those goals.\n\n\n**MINOR**\n\n- What is the meaning of \"the goal sets can overlap but their intersection is empty'\n- Figure 1.c is unclear. What are the overlapping goals?\n- \"Medium-play and large-play datasets\" are never explained. A brief explanation would have helped with readability.\n- Page 7 \"different ...\""
