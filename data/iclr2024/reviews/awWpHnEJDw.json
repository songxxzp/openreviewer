There also exists earlier/concurrent work that conducts image decomposition using text-diffusion models, so its worth discussing pros and cons but may not need comparison if works are concurrent.\n- most of concepts shown in the paper are mainly objects, thus its ability to learn abstract concepts is not clear.

Though, I tend to think that the model is rather limited in understanding complex concepts other than objects.\n- The method essentially utilizes arithmetic with word embeddings which have been widely used in the past, so it doesn't seem to be novel enough.

Can the authors elaborate a little bit on how Conceptor can be used for a particular downstream application (e.g., bias mitigation given that Conceptor can detect biases?)\n- Can the authors elaborate if the concept decomposition is an artifact of the particular CLIP text-encoder in Stable-Diffusion? Will one get similar concept-decomposition patterns if a different text-encoder is used (e.g., T5 like in DeepFloyd)? I would imagine this to be a positive answer, but might expect different patterns, so I believe it\u2019s important to use Conceptor to understand this phenomenon.\n- I am a little curious about how much the diffusion objective plays a role in concept-decomposition. For e.g., given the objective of reconstruction, I will expect the faithfulness metric of Conceptor to be better than other methods (e.g., PEZ). However, if you use the same idea with CLIP loss (replacing the reconstruction loss in Eq. (6) with L_clip), will you get similar decomposition? And will those decompositions transfer to diffusion models?  In fact, if you use CLIP's representation for a particular token as a ground-truth with optimizing for Eq.(3), you should get a reasonable reconstruction still, which can be a cheap baseline. Did the authors run this ablation?\n- How can you extend your framework to more complex concept-decomposition? The current framework generates images corresponding to single concepts, but images are usually consisting of multiple concepts. In this scenario, how can one use Conceptor to understand sub-concepts? I think this is one experiment, the paper is lacking."

I've verified and indeed in the CLIP text space, the triangular similarity relationships are very noisy and seem not reflect true semantic similarity. Therefore I'd raise my rating to 6. As a relevant piece of observation, my original comments on the CLIP triangular relationships are kept as below.\n\n====== original comment ======\n\nMy biggest concern is that it's unnecessary to use image reconstruction as a proxy to find the combination weights (Eq.3). This method can totally work in the CLIP text space only. I've tried to compute the textual similarity of the words presented in Figure 2:\n\nTriplet: 'camel' and 'giraffe'  'cashmere'\n- 'camel' vs 'giraffe': 0.834\n- 'camel' vs 'cashmere': 0.774\n- 'camel' vs 'giraffe' + 'cashmere': 0.872\n\nTriplet: 'snail' and 'ladybug'  'winding'\n- 'snail' vs 'ladybug': 0.768\n- 'snail' vs 'winding': 0.816\n- 'snail' vs 'ladybug' + 'winding': 0.855\n\nTriplet: 'dietitian' and 'pharmacist'   'nutritious'\n- 'dietitian' vs 'pharmacist': 0.878\n- 'dietitian' vs 'nutritious': 0.874\n- 'dietitian' vs 'pharmacist' + 'nutritious': 0.915\n\nTriplet: 'snake' and 'twisted'  'gecko'\n- 'snake' vs 'twisted': 0.869\n- 'snake' vs 'gecko': 0.848\n- 'snake' vs 'twisted' + 'gecko': 0.913\n\nTriplet: 'reflections of earth' and 'sphere'    'civilization'\n- 'reflections of earth' vs 'sphere': 0.761\n- 'reflections of earth' vs 'civilization': 0.804\n- 'reflections of earth' vs 'sphere' + 'civilization': 0.831\n\nTriplet: 'fear' and 'scream'    'wolf'\n- 'fear' vs 'scream': 0.892\n- 'fear' vs 'wolf': 0.875\n- 'fear' vs 'scream' + 'wolf': 0.926\n\nWe can see that for a triplet A,B,C, the similarity of A vs. (B+C) is always higher than A vs B or A vs C. That means similar semantic correlations already exist in the CLIP text embedding space. Intuitively, since CLIP text embeddings are to be aligned with image features, such similarities in the image features will propagate to the text embedding space.\n\nTherefore, doing image reconstruction with T2I diffusion model is unnecessary. If we only mine such triplets from the CLIP text embedding space, then the contribution of this paper becomes quite small. Therefore, I suggest rejection."
