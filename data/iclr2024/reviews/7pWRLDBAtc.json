The paper is motivated by a discussion of the challenges of data heterogeneity; however, it would be more clear if the authors in the beginning of the paper would include a clear definition of the type of heterogeneity that is addressed, and which personalized settings the developed methods apply to. Statements such as \"To solve the data heterogeneity problem...\" seem to indicate that heterogenous data is a kind of external obstacle, rather than an inherent property of the problem PFL is aiming to solve. \n\nIn the related works section, there is the following statement: \"However, the existing approaches have primarily focused on addressing heterogeneity related to class distributions, system resources, and model architecture. The issue of feature distributional shifts in PFL remains under-explored.\" While it may be true that the issue is underexplored, it would be great with a clear delineage of which existing works address this issue, and which of the related methods could reasonably expected to work under covariate shift.\n\n\"In FL, each client will update the local model using the global update after each communication\nround.\" While this is not wrong per se, there are many ways local and global updates are carried out in different algorithms, depending on the problem setup and assumptions behind the particular algorithm.\n\nIt is not clear if the results are a fair comparison, i.e. whether or not each algorithm is independently optimized sufficiently well.\n\nThe section on the convergence analysis seems a bit disintegrated with the rest of the paper.\n\nSimple experiments that highlight the applicability of the method are not included. I would have appreciated a clear demonstration, e.g. in comparison with fixed local-global ratios.\n\nAn empirical demonstration of proposition 1 would have been a strong argument for the specific choices made for the mixing ratio.\n\nMinor issues\nparamters -> parameters\nfootnote -> subscript\ntr should be roman in eq. 7"

It is my understanding that the objective of these methods is to learn a global model, so they are designed for another purpose than PFL.\n\nAre the methods described only applicable in the context of stochastic gradient descent? It would be beneficial to have a clear definition of the problem setup in which the proposed methods apply.\n\nIn sec. 3.1 both covariate shift and concept drift are mentioned. Is this method applicable to both scenarios? This should preferably be clear from the introduction.\n\nAre there any previous papers that consider the update strategy in eq. 3, or is this an idea that has not yet been explored?\n\nIt is not always clear to me if w_c and u denote models or model weights?\n\nWhere does eq. 4 come from? There is no details regarding its derivation or any clear reference.\n\nIs proposition 1 a novel result, and if so in which sense?\n\nIt is uncler to me if the mixing ratio in eq. 5 is optimal in some sense? Intuitively, the global and local model might both have different error and different convergence properties, so should the model error not also be taken into account?\n\nDoes it make a big difference that you only consider the last layer in the approximation of the Gram matrix? Can the arguments be supported empirically or theoretically?\n\nWhat exactly is meant by this statement: \"since the data is distributed and not directly accessible, we propose employing features from local data in conjunction with the global model u\"? Do you employ the representation (first layers) of the local model?\n\nIs it correctly understood that you use a fixed learning rate for all experiments, which is not optimized?\n\nWhat are the practical implications of the convergence analysis in sec. 4? How is the theorem and proof different form exising convergence results?\n\nI do not understand the arguments in the paragraph titled \"Feature value distribution by our personalized model\". What results is the statement \"If a model learns confident representations, then the related neurons should be highly activated...\" based on?\n\nIf instead we used a fixed (optimized) ratio of local and global updates, does your method have a clear advantage?"

If so, I think a storage comparison among baselines is required to comprehensively compare the efficiency.\n2. The authors should provide the training wall-clock time required to compare the practical efficiency. \n3. The motivation is to select the faster convergence to match the local or global model. So I think it is necessary to introduce the loss curve or gradient norm to illustrate its improvements. This paper does not analyze the improvements in the test error and generalization performance. Under the specific convergence analysis, how does the proposed method match the convergence analysis? And does the training loss or gradient norm decrease faster?"
