While this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of various MTSAD methods in terms of accuracy metrics, it would significantly benefit from an evaluation of efficiency and scalability aspects. This is crucial given the large-scale nature of the datasets and the potential real-world deployment of these methods.\n\nW2. **Robustness of Methods:** \nIn addition to the primary evaluation metrics, it is essential to consider the robustness of the MTS anomaly detection methods. Variability in results due to factors such as random seed settings for methods like IForest or initial weight configurations for deep learning methods can significantly impact the reliability of the method in real-world scenarios.\n\nW3. **Statistical Test**: \nFor a benchmark endeavor, a comprehensive statistical test might be necessary. The authors could add a statistical test on multiple methods based on all datasets used for each metric. This will provide a clear yet insightful view of the rank of different methods and differences among various metrics. For example, the SMD can be divided into 28 subsets, so the authors could treat them as separate datasets, just as treating different instances in AIOps as different datasets.\n\nW4. **Inclusion of Advanced Methods:** \nWhile the paper provides an extensive list of methods evaluated, it seems to miss out on some of the advanced methods. For example, they have experimented with the PSM dataset but appear to have omitted the RANSynCoders method, which is intrinsically linked with this dataset. RANSynCoders, given its relevance to the PSM dataset, could provide insightful results and comparisons.\n\n* Abdulaal, Ahmed, Zhuanghua Liu, and Tomer Lancewicki. \"Practical approach to asynchronous multivariate time series anomaly detection and localization.\" In Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGKDD conference on knowledge discovery & data mining, pp. 2485-2494. 2021.\n\nW5. **Parameter Settings:** \nThe paper might benefit from a clearer explanation of certain methodological choices, such as parameter settings for various algorithms.\n\nW6. **Justification of  AIOps Datasets:** \nThe authors have rigorously introduced the limitations of the existing datasets and proposed a new large-scale dataset along with its background and collection mechanism. However, they could provide more justifications (e.g., using some case study) on why such datasets are able to alleviate the aforementioned issues in the existing ones."

This would not only give insights into the efficiency of each method but also highlight any potential trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.\n\nQ2. Can the authors analyze how the running time of each method changes with respect to the number of dimensions (#dims) and the number of timestamps (#timestamps)? This can reveal potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in certain methods and provide guidance on which methods are more suitable for specific types of datasets.\n\nQ3. Given the emphasis on large-scale real-world datasets, can they show how each method scales with increasing data size? This will provide crucial insights for practitioners considering deploying these methods in real-world scenarios where data scales can be massive.\n\nRegarding W2:\n\nQ4: To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of robustness, it would be beneficial if the authors conducted multiple runs of each method with varied configurations (e.g., different random seeds and initial weight settings). Then, the authors could report the standard deviations of the results for each method. This would provide insights into the variability or consistency of the method's performance across different runs or configurations. \n\nRegarding W4:\n\nQ5: Can the authors consider adding RANSynCoders to their benchmarking methods, especially when using the PSM dataset? This will not only enhance the paper's credibility but also provide a more holistic view of how different methods perform on this specific dataset."
