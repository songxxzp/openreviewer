To deal with anomalies in the labels, authors propose to use Learn with Noisy Labels (LNL) framework and present analysis of LNL in the regression setting. They also introduce a heuristic approach to deal with anomalies in the input data by discarding samples where anomalies appear towards the end of an input sample. They combine both techniques in RobustTSF algorithm and compare it on two datasets with existing state-of-the-art approaches."

However, this sections misses a comparison of RobustTSF to other approaches on the test set with anomalies. It would be very relevant for practical applications if this evaluation is expanded.\n* Ablation study section: what is presented is not an ablation study, but rather a hyperparameter tuning on the test dataset. An ablation study would, for example, consider the effect of LNL and sample selection separately, i.e. what happens when one applies only LNL or only sample selection. \n* Parameter \\tau seems to be scale dependent and while appendix mentions that the time series are normalized, the main text omits this detail."

                "value": "The paper introduces a method that combines the learning with noisy labels (LNL) technique and time series forecasting with anomalies (TSFA). The key distinction is that LNL deals with label noise in the target variable Y, while TSFA handles noise in both the input variable X and the target variable Y, making TSFA more complex than LNL. The authors categorize anomalies into three types: constant, missing, and Gaussian type anomalies. They analyze the loss robustness when anomalies affect Y and the sample robustness when anomalies affect X.\nThe authors propose a method called RobustTSF that integrates LNL and TSFA. Specifically, they provide a method for selecting time series with minimal anomalies. The process involves computing the trend of a given time series, denoted as S, and constructing a triplet D = (X, S, Y). An anomaly score A is defined as the difference between X and S, with an associated weight w. After calculating the anomaly scores for all samples, the authors design the final loss function for RobustTSF, employing the mean absolute error (MAE) as a more robust loss function. They utilize the anomaly score to measure the degree of anomalies in the time series data and perform appropriate filtering.\nImportantly, this method does not rely on any specific deep learning model and can be compatible with any DNN model for time series forecasting."

Its explanation is spread across several pages, and one has to wait until the 6th page to get an idea of how the algorithm will work, even though the idea itself is rather simple: identifying anomalies in the signal and applying very weak penalties to the cost in the corresponding region. It would be much easier to read the article if even a brief description were introduced very early on to understand the relevance of the different theorems formulated.\n\n* Regarding novelty, the main theorems seem to be adapted quite directly from other works, so there isn't much novelty there. Furthermore, the idea of filtering and training on robust windows is not very new either, and the filtering method is also pre-existing. Apart from adapting the framework for anomalies to time series, there isn't a significant novelty.\n\n* Regarding Section 5, which analyzes the effect of the position of anomalies on forecasting, it seems quite normal that anomalies near the end of the signal disrupt the prediction more than anomalies at the beginning. The system's state is disrupted, making forecasting more challenging. In contrast, if the anomalies are at the beginning, the model has time to stabilize on the 'correct' values.\n\n* However, the biggest weakness of the article lies in the experiments, which do not include any modern time series forecasting baselines (such as PatchTST, DLinear, Autoformer, ...). From a few quick experiments I conducted using the authors' code, DLinear seems to easily outperform the proposed model on the noisy data. This raises the question of the method's relevance if state-of-the-art models do not struggle with the anomalies considered by the authors. Of course, I may be mistaken, but in any case, it would be helpful to have the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms on this kind of problem to understand the challenges posed by the envisaged anomalies."
