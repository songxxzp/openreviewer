I wonder if it is proper to say the performance as the new state-of-the-art results as mentioned in the abstract. The FCD for QM9 and NSPDK for ZINC do not seem to be state-of-the-art results. Also, as the authors adapted DiGress, the performance comparison with DiGress can be meaningful.\n3. Lack of detailed analysis on the sample quality-time trade-off.

The goal of combining autoregressive method and one-shot generation is to combine their strength together while eliminate their shortcomings. However I think the proposed method is not ideal for this goal. For example, one-shot diffusion is a permutation equivariant generation model that is invariant to node permutation, here the designed model becomes ordering sensitive, which needs a careful ablation over node removing process. And autoregressive method has the problem of being hard to parallel during training, hence the designed model will be even slower in training comparing with one-shot generation. Last, the reported experimental result doesn't show a significant benefit of adapting sequential generation to one-shot diffusion. \n3. The experimental result is kind of weak at current stage. First, for both QM9 and ZINC, the result doesn't beat the baseline like CDGS in many perspective. Second, for generic graph generation in Appendix, the designed method is significantly worse than the baseline. This questions whether the designed method, while being combination of autoregressive and one-shot, may suffers from the shortcoming of both sides instead of combining their strengths. Also, the designed method may suffer from the randomness of block removing process. \n4. I suggest the author also discuss the training cost instead of just the test runtime and memory cost."

Specifically, at each step, the Insertion Model chooses how many new nodes to generate, the Filler Model fills the new nodes\u2019 labels, features, and connections, and the Halt Model chooses if the generation needs to terminate. The training of the IFH framework uses the denoising diffusion model to develop a reversed node removal process, which destroys a given graph through many steps. Experimental results demonstrate the sample quality-time trade-off across a range of molecular and generic graphs datasets."
