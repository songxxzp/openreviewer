                "value": "This paper proposes a multi-instance framework for WSI classification that incorporates the spatial context of patch instances into the architecture of the model via a combination of transformer and neighbor-constrained attention with constrastive learning. The input images are preprocessed into features using a model trained with self-supervised contrastive learning (SimCLR) on pathology images with an ImageNet-pre-trained ResNet18. The transformer module follows the NystroFormer architecture. The attention module is the main contribution of this paper and trains an feature-similarity-weighted adjacency matrix. Experiments are performed on two well-known pathology datasets (CAMELYon-16 and TCGA-NSCLC) for a binary classification task (cancer/non-cancer). SOTA accuracy and AUC are reported for both datasets. An ablation study examines the separate effects of the Nystroformer and the attention module, showing the attention module to provide the largest improvement."

However, it remains unclear how well this method generalizes to datasets beyond the particular choices of dataset and task focuses on in this paper.\n\n2. Currently the neighbor-contrained idea is operationalized by masking the attention matrix (from self-attention) using the neighborhood mask. However, the attention scores from self-attention typically represent how much a tile attends to other tiles, not necessarily how much the slide-level prediction attends to that specific tile. It is not clear how directly masking on this attention matrix relates to the intuition above.\n\n3. Feature extractor backbone is an important factor for final performance.
