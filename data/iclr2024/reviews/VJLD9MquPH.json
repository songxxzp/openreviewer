For example, the authors could experiment on some simulation/real datasets to see if this assumption is satisfied.\n2. The advantage of applying quantized optimization is not clearly stated. It would be better if clear motivation of using quantized method, or its computational or analytical benefits are claimed to convince readers.\n3. The key point of this paper is somewhat ambiguous. If the major contribution lies in theoretical analysis, the authors should emphasize it and conduct simulation experiments to validate the stochastic approximation and convergence results, rather than merely performing real data experiments; if the contribution lies in experimental results, models like CNN and ResNet may seem to be too simple. Larger datasets and model structures should be tested to verify the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.\n4.

Consequently, between the injected additive noise (easy to implement) and the quantized algorithms (hard to implement), it is hard to tell which one is better as they are supposed to improve the performance in the same way.
