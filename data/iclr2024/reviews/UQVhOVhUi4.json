I don't understand the arguments there, or if they are attempting to make one. x0-parameterization of DDPM (e.g. Vignac 2023) by definition predicts the destination. Does it capture topology? In fact, every generative model predicts destination in one way or another (VAE, GAN, and $\\epsilon$-parameterized diffusion models are equivalent to x0-parameterization). Do they capture topology? \"Loss-Guided Diffusion Models for Plug-and-Play Controllable Generation\", for example, attempts to generate a destination \"distribution\" by doing MC on top of an x0-parameterization.\n - The paper assumes that the audience has prior knowledge on bridge processes. The only explanation offered is that they are \"processes conditioned to an endpoint,\" which I find unhelpful. The writing can be improved in this regard.\n - The paper is without a discussion about the graph data structure in use; the omission is made explicit at the end of Sec 3. For this I find the writing difficult to follow at times. How does one take the weighted mean of discrete graphs and molecules? They are finally discussed in appendix B.3, but only in reference to other papers. \n - The main paper can really use an \\Algorithm block from appendix B.2 (although not sure what to remove), to help the readers follow the sampling procedure."

The main weakness in the paper is the lack of clarity about the argument behind the central claim that destination prediction facilitates more effective modeling of graph topological data. While the experimental results clearly show that this is the case, I failed to understand why this would be the case as I read the paper. The methodology described in Section 3 is completely agnostic to the fact that we are considering graph data, and while I can understand why it might be in general advantageous to predict the destination of diffusion, I'm not sure why this is particularly the case for graphs. The authors claim that destination prediction explicitly learns graph structure, but it is not clear to me why this is the case. Maybe this can be explained more clearly early in the text, towards the beginning of section 3.\n2. The sampling procedure does not seem to be explained in the main text. Figure 1 (b) demonstrates the diffusion process at sampling time, but since this is not explained in the text, it is a bit confusing to see how to connect the learned ${\\bf s}_\\theta$ to the sampling procedure. It would be better to include Algorithms 1 and 2 in the main body of the text, including a brief explanation of Algorithm 2.\n\nDespite my concerns above, I think this paper outlines a novel, effective procedure for graph generation. I believe some clarity in the text regarding the main claim and the sampling procedure would greatly enhance the clarity of the contribution."

How does this approach compare to denoising-diffusion-type models in non-graph settings? While I understand this is not the focus of the paper, I think conducting a small experiment or at least commenting on this would make it clear why destination prediction is well-suited to graph data. As in the previous question, it is not clear to me why destination prediction is connected to the topology of the data."
