As shown by [2], most prior defense GNN methods can be easily broken by adaptive attacks, which are aware of the given defense method during attacking. Thus, it is very important to adaptively attack PROSPECT to demonstrate its true robustness.\n- The heterophilous datasets used in this work (e.g. Chameleon) are known to have some critical issues (e.g., train-test data leakage) [3]. Hence, the experimental results would be more compelling if authors could evaluate on the datasets from [3,4].\n- Missing detailed hyperparameter settings for baselines.

It is unclear whether authors put in enough efforts on tuning those baselines.\n- Claim 3 is too strong.

While Theorem 1 might imply robustness on cSBMs, it is merely conjectured that this robustness extrapolates to real-world graphs.\n1. Poisoning defense heavily uses the restricted threat model to solely perturb the graph structure and not the node features. It is one thing to follow the many other works in this simplifying assumption that focuses on the distinct characteristics of the robustness of GNNs; however, exploiting the clean node features seems highly questionable. The authors should discuss this and evaluate w.r.t., e.g., a joint attack on the graph structure and node features.\n1. The empirical evaluation is insufficient: The authors solely evaluate using a non-adaptive transfer attack. As pointed out previously, it is vital to assess neural networks with adaptive attacks [C, D] to get a proper estimate of the model's robustness.\n1. The authors claim scalability. Thus, they should compare to other works using large graphs [A, B]\n1. Just because an MLP is robust w.r.t. structure perturbations does not imply it is useful. Moreover, there might be an interaction between the GNN and MLP. If the authors make a claim about evasion (e.g. second last line of page 3), they should also verify that empirically.\n1.
