However, the key contribution of the paper is that the solving strategy is learnt by a reinforcement learning (RL) system. The RL system has access to a set of rules/actions, that can be iteratively composed to solve the linear equation. The authors propose a novel strategy, whereby parts of equations and additional constant coefficients can be stored in a stack, from where they can be called or acted upon with a possible set of actions, to solve the linear equation."

This is not completely a criticism, as it could be exciting to extend CASs with RL for efficiency. But I am not sure this paper provides many novel ideas in that direction. I believe the paper can be a stepping stone to a real proof-of-concept for RL applications to CAS, but in its present form it is too limited."

The authors then train a deep reinforcement learning agent, using double deep Q-learning, to operate this stack machine, with the objective of reducing given algebraic expressions to a canonical (\"solved\") form.\n\nThe authors show that, with an appropriate curriculum, the agent can indeed learn to operate this machine to achieve the goal of solving the equations. Further, they show that by introducing a second RL agent in an adversarial generator-solver arrangement with the first, that they can reduce the need to hand-craft a curriculum - although they do find that it is still useful to craft a simpler curriculum for maximum performance."

                "value": "I think there are two main weaknesses with this paper: that it doesn't support its main claim; and that the domain it is applied to is too simple to really get a sense for whether the approach is useful or interesting.\n\nThe paper claims in the introduction that \"humans must implement the discovered rules as computer programs\" in traditional computer algebra systems and that \"this process could benefit greatly from techniques that enable computers to discover and implement transformation rules on their own.\" In the conclusion the authors claim that their work \"can be seen as a first step towards the general goal of creating a machine-learned computer algebra system in which the fundamental laws of mathematical reasoning and deduction are discovered autonomously by an AI.\" I do not think this claim is supported by the work presented. When the authors introduce their representation of the algebraic equations, and the operations of the stack machine, they implicitly encode all of the \"fundamental laws of mathematical reasoning and deduction\" that are necessary for this domain. These are fully sufficient for this domain, and so in that sense also all the \"fundamental laws\" that this system will ever contain. More specifically, their assumptions immediately partition the space of expressions into equivalence classes that encode the notion of semantic equality in this domain. The act of \"solving\" the equations can be thought of as the act of finding a canonical exemplar (or, at least, an exemplar from a canonical subset as the authors' definition of \"solved\" admits multiple solutions). So what the RL algorithm has found is a search algorithm within an equivalence class that finds a canonical example. This is an interesting and useful thing to do, but I would argue that is does not in any sense enable their system to discover any fundamental laws of mathematics - these were all in there right from the start when the authors defined their system. So I don't think the main claim of the paper is supported by the developments presented.\n\nThe second weakness is that the domain in which the authors work is exceedingly simple: that of simple algebraic equalities. Viewed through the lens described above - that what the authors' RL algorithm really does is discover effective search procedures for canonical exemplars in the domain, then I think a valid question is \"how complex would it be to develop such an algorithm another way?\" And the answer is \"essentially trivial\". Many straightforward algorithms exist for doing this search, including the ones routinely taught to schoolchildren and those implemented in standard linear system solvers. So from my perspective showing that an RL agent can discover such an algorithm isn't really a convincing result. It would be interesting if an RL algorithm could find search algorithms that are not known to existing computer algebra systems (or even schoolchildren) but that hasn't been demonstrated in this paper. So my feeling here is that the authors would really have to show that their system can discover non-trivial search algorithms for it to be a notable result."

            "questions": {
                "value": "The opening analogy is confusing: while there's only one correct solution to the equation in some sense, there are usually multiple structural forms for that solution (x = 2 - c, x = -c + 2), and there are many sequences of manipulations that would lead to those goal states. So it seems like the situation is not that different from chess, in the sense that one is trying to find a sequence of moves to get to a subset of states that have some particular property."
