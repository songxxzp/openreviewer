Let $T$ be a collection of some desirable probability distributions (i.e. probability of the true label $p(y|\\tilde x)$ satisfies some lower and upper bound constraints). Let reward $\\delta$ be some notion of distance between $p(y|\\tilde x)$ and the target set $T$. The authors propose a formulation to strike a balance between $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$ as opposed to simply using classical methods in either counterfactual research or adversarial examples. \n\nOne key novelty is the verification stage in which they train a classifier $f(x, x')$ that predicts if $x$ and $x'$ have the same label. The authors argue that this verification helps in identifying examples that more faithfully reflect changes in the underlying true class, as opposed to the surrogate classifier (like in adversarial examples). \n\nThe authors refer to these modifications as \"amicable perturbations.\" They argue that these can be useful, for instance, when the goal is not related to machine learning per se (e.g. for interpretability or robustness research), but, rather, to offer some guidance on how to change the instance such that it belongs to a desired set of classes (e.g. do a minimal change to a given resume in order to increase the probability of landing interviews)."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The primary weakness is the lack of distinction between correlation and causation. The idea of altering an instance $x$ to $\\tilde x$ does not really mean that $p(y|\\tilde x)$ can be estimated based on the original joint distribution $p(y, x)$. In fact, this is precisely the type of questions the literature in causal analysis focuses on. Amicable perturbation corresponds to what is commonly referred to as do-queries; see for instance Pearl's introduction to causal analysis (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20305706/). The main takeaway is that $p(y|\\tilde x)$ (post-intervention) is not necessarily the same distribution as pre-intervention.\n\nBut, the main argument in the paper is the claim that one can estimate $p(y| do(x))$ based on the original joint distribution $p(y, x)$, which is wrong. This can even be seen in one of the examples the authors mention in Section 4, in which their approach suggests that an individual should move from the Far West to the Great Lakes in order to improve their chances of passing the BAR exam. In my own opinion, unless this is addressed, the motivation behind the work is questionable.\n\nSecond, while the authors distance themselves from counterfactual and adversarial examples, their formulation seems to be an extension of those methods. The authors extend those methods to handle the tradeoff between effort and reward. Compare for example Equations 5, 6, and 7. This by itself is not a major limitation. However, I mention it here because the narrative of the paper suggests that amicable perturbations are quite different, when they aren't. In Figure 4, for instance, counterfactuals lie *along* the Pareto curve for amicable perturbations. \n\nThird, one key novelty in this work is the idea of verification. But, I don't think this is well justified. When a model is trained on pairs of examples $(x, x')$ from the same distribution $\\mathcal{D}$, why should the model work well on examples from a different distribution (e.g. $x$ and its perturbation $\\tilde x$)? If it could work, then the OOD problem would be solved. There is no empirical evidence that it works in the present paper, aside from the fact that it has some effect.\n\nA few comments about the presentation:\n- It would improve readability if $\\mathcal{Y}$ is defined from the beginning as a collection of probability distributions. This becomes clear only later in the analysis, which can be confusing.\n- Page 2: Missing space in \"no greater than q.Then\".\n- Equation 5: Missing outer parentheses or at least a space should be added after argmin. Currently, the equation reads as if the minimization is applied to the first term only.\n- Page 4: typo in \"but they but\"\n- Page 6: typo in \"ensure that out solution\"\n- Page 6: Missing space in \"coherent.To solve\"\n- Page 6: typo in \"In Section 2, discussed\"\n- Page 7: typo in \"not be be\"\n- Page 7: typo in \"differentiable and and cannot\""

It should contain over 48,000 examples.\n- How is distance $d(x, \\tilde x)$ defined in each dataset?

Unlike adversarial examples, these perturbations are designed to impact the true class of a data point. The authors introduce a novel method to verify the impact of amicable perturbations on the true class probabilities.\n\n\nMost importantly, the paper's definition of amicable perturbations is akin to \"improving counterfactual explanations\" [1]. This problem has originally been identified theoretically in [2] and was conceptualized in [3]. Hence, the claim that \"amicable perturbations\" are a new concept is probably overstated and unfortunately limits the novelty of the paper's contribution to the field. That being said, the suggested Verifier is still an interesting concept. However, the paper falls short of a more detailed analysis regarding its efficacy and how it theoretically affects the recourse problem. I would evaluate the paper more favourably if the authors instead focused on the analysis of the recourse problem + verifier. For example, the authors could analyze the recourse performance wrt to ground truth label flips and understand the conditions (on the data generating process, classifier performance, etc.) under which successful identification of an \"improving counterfactual explanation\" that effectively alters the true class of an individual is possible.\n\n\n----- \nReferences\n\n[1] Freiesleben (2021), \"The Intriguing Relation Between Counterfactual Explanations and Adversarial Examples\", Minds and Machines\n\n[2] Pawelczyk et al (2022), \u201cExploring Counterfactual Explanations Through the Lens of Adversarial Examples: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis\u201d, Proceedings of The 25th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS)\n\n[3] Freiesleben et al (2023), \u201cImprovement-Focused Causal Recourse (ICR)\u201d, Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)"

Moreover, exploring the feasibility of an end-to-end optimization that uses the Verifier as constraint in the optimization could potentially enhance the study's robustness and applicability. \n\nAs a side note: The verifier is differentiable (or can be made differentiable) as far as I see.

Note that the idea of adversarially robust recourse has been explored in several prior work [2, 3] which the authors have not referenced.\n\n3. The scenario of what to do when the verifier rejects a candidate perturbation is underexplored in the paper. The authors propose some actions at end of Section 3, but I don't believe these were used in the experiments. I would be particularly interested to see whether action (2) can help in raising the success rate.\n\n4.

                "value": "The paper proposes a novel type of input perturbations termed amicable perturbations whose goal is to find the most efficient changes to an input in order to achieve a more favorable classification outcome in the real world. The efficiency of input changes is quantified using a cost or distance function that could be domain (dataset) dependent, and the changes are constrained to be realistic/meaningful. They clearly contrast amicable perturbations from counterfactual and adversarial inputs, and provide a number of real-world examples to motivate it. Different from adversarial inputs, amicable perturbations seek to modify the true class of an input. \n\nThe paper then defines the idea of an $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ amicable perturbation, where $\\epsilon$ corresponds to the cost of making the change from $x$ to $\\tilde{x}$ and $\\delta$ corresponds to how closely we want the true class of $\\tilde{x}$ to approach the target desirable set. They propose a closed-form solution for the statistical distance to the target set for a family of f-divergence based distances (Theorem 1), which is an interesting result. Based on this, they propose a constrained optimization algorithm to find amicable perturbations for neural network classifiers on tabular datasets."

Clearly discusses and contrasts amicable perturbations with counterfactual inputs and adversarial perturbations.\n\nThe changes suggested by amicable perturbations offer useful insights (advice) that can help people or products in real world situations. This is discussed with many examples and also shown in the experiments. Therefore, the intended use case of amicable perturbations is for enabling social improvement.\n\nThe development of the formalism in terms of the actionable set, effort/cost function, and the desired goal is very principled. The analysis of the statistical distance to the target set in terms of f-divergence and deriving its closed form solution as a piecewise linear function, which is continuously differentiable (Theorem 1) is a neat contribution.\n\nOverall, the paper presents an interesting and novel contribution, which could spur a new line of research similar to adversarial examples."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**1.** The proposed amicable perturbations are mainly suitable for tabular datasets, with well-defined input features. It is not clear how they can be applied to image and text datasets. A discussion on this would be useful. \n\n**2.** The method supports only differentiable models such as deep neural networks, but cannot be applied to non-differentiable models such gradient-boosted decision trees or random forest. However, the latter models are widely used for tabular data since they often have better performance. The ability to handle such models would provide more flexibility to their proposed method. \n\n**3.** Some of the details in Algorithm 1 are not clear. For instance, how is the projection function to satisfy coherency $cond(\\tilde{x})$ defined? Since the features of the tabular datasets are often categorical or binary, it seems like using gradient descent is not the best approach to optimizing the perturbation. They have to introduce penalty terms to remain in the actional set $\\mathcal{A}(x)$, and a projection function $cond(x)$ to satisfy coherency. There is not enough discussion on how effective this approach is and its limitations. I would suggest including a paragraph on the limitations and future work (scope for improvement) covering these aspects.\n\n**4.** The paper applies the Carlini-Wagner $\\ell_2$ attack to generate adversarial inputs. However, it does not seem appropriate to apply this attack for these tabular datasets where some of the features are categorical or binary. It is likely to find adversarial inputs that are easily detectable by the verification function.  \n\n**5.**  Minor: needs some proof-reading for language and typos. Some details about the algorithm are missing and could be included. Please see my suggestions in the `Questions` section."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "**1)** The citation format of references is not correct. There should be a parentheses around citations; e.g. (Leo et al., 2019) instead of Leo et al., 2019.\n\n**2)** The paper needs some proofreading for language issues and typos. For instance, in the last paragraph of page 2, it should be: \n> \u201cIn Section 2, we define an amicable perturbation as well as contrast it with related work.\u201d \n\n**3)** The paper needs to define $k$ as the number of classes and $m$ as the input dimension at the start of Section 2. Sometimes these two symbols are interchanged leading to confusion. A few instances are listed below:\n- In Eqn 28, it should be $m$ instead of $k$ denoting the number of features.\n- In the proof of theorem 1 (Appendix 5.1), the number of classes is denoted by $m$ instead of $k$. \n- On page 6, under `Solving Step 1`, the projection function should be defined as $\\text{cond} : \\mathrm{R}^m \\mapsto \\mathcal{X}$. \n\n### 4) Section 2, Problem setting and goals\nThe notations could be more clear. Rather than saying $(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{Y}) \\sim \\mathcal{D}$, it would be better to say $(x, y) \\sim \\mathcal{D}$, where $x \\in \\mathcal{X} \\subset \\mathrm{R}^m$ and $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$. Here, $\\mathcal{Y}$ is the $k$ probability simplex. \n\nAlso, different from conventional notation where $y$ is an integer, here it is the true (conditional) probability distribution over the set of classes. Therefore, it would be clearer to define a class random variable $C \\in \\\\{1, \\cdots, k\\\\}$ and $y := [P(C=1 | x), \\cdots, P(C=k | x)]$, i.e. the true class posterior probabilities. Of course, this could specialize to a one-hot coded label.  \n\nWith this definition, it is clear that an amicable perturbation $\\tilde{x}$ aims to change the true class of an input to a desired $\\tilde{y} := [P(C=1 | \\tilde{x}), \\cdots, P(C=k | \\tilde{x})]$.    \n\nIn the definition of the difference training data (before Eqn 3), used to train $V(x, \\tilde{x})$, it should not include pairs $(i, j)$ where $i = j$. If the architecture of $V$ does not depend on the order of inputs, then it should only include pairs where $j > i$.\n\nIn Eqn (3), it would be simpler to define $z^{(i,j)} = \\mathrm{1}[y^{(i)} = y^{(j)}]$, i.e. using the indicator function. \n\n### 5) On training the verification function (page 4)\nThe verification function $V$ is actually estimating the conditional probability that the true class corresponding to $x$ and $\\tilde{x}$ are equal given the inputs. Let $C$ and $\\tilde{C}$ denote the true class corresponding to $x$ and $\\tilde{x}$. The verification function estimates the probability $P(C = \\tilde{C} | x, \\tilde{x})$. Another way to estimate this probability is using the classifier $M(x)$, assuming conditional independence of $C$ and $\\tilde{C}$ given $(x, \\tilde{x})$, as follows: \n$\\hat{P}(C = \\tilde{C} | x, \\tilde{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^k M_i(x) M_i(\\tilde{x})$\n\n**6)** For solving step 2 (page 6), it is mentioned that a large random sample of input pairs from the test set which have different labels are used to set the threshold $\\gamma$. Is it appropriate to use the labeled test set for deciding the verification threshold without introducing bias? \n\n### 7) Regarding Algorithm 1\nWould suggest defining the penalty terms $b(\\tilde{x})$, $p(\\tilde{x})$ and the projection function $cond(x)$. Is it possible to provide a general form for different scenarios? It would be good to provide pointers in the main paper to the penalty terms defined in Appendix 5.2.1. \n\nIn the step where the gradient $\\textbf{g}$ is calculated, please show that the gradient is over all the terms by including parentheses around the terms.\n\nIn practice, is it sufficient to use a fixed learning rate $\\alpha$ for the gradient descent? Have the authors explored adaptive learning rate schemes?\n\nPlease add comments for some of the lines in the algorithm for clarity. For example, can add a comment like \u201c// Projection to ensure coherancy\u201d to the line $\\tilde{x} = cond(\\tilde{x})$.\n\nIt would help to provide a precise method (recipe) to adjust $\\lambda$ and the problem parameters. What is the method used in your implementation?\n\n**8)** It would be interesting to explore non-gradient based optimization methods for finding the amicable perturbations. This would allow us to extend the method to non-differentiable models such as gradient-boosted decision trees. \n\n**9)** In the experimental setup (Section 4), the cost function for each dataset should be $d_{\\mathcal{X}}$, not $d_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Same comment for Figure 3. \n\n**10)** In Section 4, the cost functions $d_{\\mathcal{X}}$ defined for the datasets are somewhat vague. Could the authors describe them more precisely in an appendix?\n\n**11)** For the plots in Figure 4, how do we interpret the scale of $\\epsilon$ values on the x-axis? In the discussion in the text for the Law School dataset, it is mentioned that a short move from the Far West to the Great Lakes region and a mild increase in grades can result in a 11% increase. It is hard to understand how to translate these changes into the $\\epsilon$ (effort) values. Similar comment for the other examples.  \n\n**12)** The following lines under `Other Methods` in Section 4 is not clear.\n> The counterfactuals will belong to the same actionable set as the amicable perturbations, but the adversarial examples not be be in the actionable set or even to be coherent. This is significant because our verifier procedure should be able to recognize that these adversarial examples are not effective real world solutions.\n\n**13)**  More details on the neural networks used for each dataset in the appendix would be useful. How are they made suitable for handling categorical inputs?\n\n**14)**  Minor: the quality of math symbols in the figures can be improved. \n\n**15)**  A discussion of limitations and societal impacts of amicable perturbations would be useful. Can include points such as the computational cost of generating amicable perturbations, which may not be so bad in the real world because it is not usually time sensitive. The verification method for detecting inputs could potentially be improved to reduce the false rejection of amicable perturbations as adversarial. \n\n**16)**  Is it possible to effectively apply amicable perturbations to domains such as image and text? Could you discuss some potential use cases?"
