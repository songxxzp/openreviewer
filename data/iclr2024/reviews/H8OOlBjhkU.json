The authors introduce a IHT algorithm for optimizing over such sets, which uses a novel two step projection (TSP) procedure. By deriving an extension of the three point lemma for this setting, convergence guarantees are derived for this algorithm, assuming the objective satisfies the RSC and RSS conditions. The algorithm is extended to the stochastic and zeroth order settings where similar guarantees are derived."

In Algorithm 2, I am a bit confused about the notation $\\mathcal{S}$. Shouldn't the index set $\\mathcal{S}_t$ be a subset of $[n]$? Also in the summation index, it should be $i_t$ instead of $i$?\n\n4. The convergence results pertain to the objective value, but can something be said for the convergence of the iterates to the global minimum? (provided there is a unique global minimum of course)"

                "value": "Technically, there are hidden constraints to the main results that could significantly limit the strength of the proposed results. For example, Theorem 1 and the remarks that follow imply that the proposed two-step projection guarantees the convergence to the global minimum if the minimizer is sparse, which is not true in the most generic case (e.g., when k=1). However, the proof was made possible due to the requirement of $k\\geq \\frac{4(1-\\rho)^2 L_s^2}{\\rho^2 \\nu_s^2} \\overline{k}$, which in fact requires the sparsity constrain has to be weak, i.e., lower bounded by the square of the condition number for the non-trivial case of $\\overline{k}\\neq 0$. So, no guarantee is provided for the important case of fixed sparsity $k$, even if we allow k to be an arbitrarily large constant. \n\nSome other minor comments and suggestions:\n\n1. The main results are rather hard to read due to the fact that many needed notations are defined informally inline in different sections, for example, H_k in Theorem 1. Possible ways of improvement include either defining the notations formally in a definition environment or naming the notation so they can be easily searched. \n\n2. Interpretation of  $\\rho$ in the main result: We are generally interested in the achievable result of $R(w_t)$ and the inequality presented in Theorem 1 seems to be a more intermediate result where the role of parameter $\\rho$ could be unclear to the readers. For readability, the reviewer suggests that Remarks 3 and 4 should be summarized as a main theorem, then Theorem 1 is presented as a technical result for proving them."
