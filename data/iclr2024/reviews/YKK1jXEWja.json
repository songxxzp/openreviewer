Prospector comprises two parts: Self-Asking, which enables the LLM agent to generate questions and answer them itself, leading to improved intermediate steps in the decision making process, and Trajectory Ranking, where an LLM critic is used to predict the rewards of different trajectories. Compared to prior LLM agents for the ALFWorld and Webshop tasks that only use ICL methods, Prospector is able to achieve higher success rates."

This can maybe be clarified with further experimentation: \n\n-  It\u2019s not clear how much of the overall performance improvement is just due to giving the LLM multiple attempts at a single question with the trajectory ranking process. Further experiments disentangling this would be helpful: for example, if we used the same LLM critics and trajectory ranking process with the ReAct prompt, would it perform on par with Prospector (these experiments seem to be present for ALFWorld but not WebShop)? Would majority voting at every step, which also allows multiple trajectory attempts but without an explicit LLM critic, be less useful than using the LLM-based critic as in Prospector? \n\n- The AskAct process is does not seem like a novel contribution in and of itself, as it was proposed in Measuring and Narrowing the Compositionality Gap in Language Models (Press et al., 2022). While the authors note that that Self-Ask work was developed for QA tasks specifically, applying the same general technique of prompting the LLM to ask itself a limited set of questions to reason is a limited contribution. In particular, it seems like AskAct was not applied to the ALFWorld benchmark for the Prospector agent, and only tested in WebShop as a single fixed question that asks \"which observed object is most proper to select\" (shown in Figure 2 and Table 13 and 16). Further experiments eliciting different types of self-asked questions across all the tasks would strengthen this contribution."

Is most of the juice coming the critic-based trajectory ranking?\n- It would also be interesting to see if the few-shot critic performance improves with intermediate chain-of-thought reasoning steps in the critic prompt, rather than just having the critic immediately output a response as success/failure. \n- It would help to add a clarifying caption to Figure 2. It\u2019s not immediately clear why the AskAct reasoning is correct (the second highlighted think[] sentence on the right seems to just reiterate the query, similar to the first highlighted think[] sentence on the left). The item observations from the search don\u2019t seem to indicate which option matches the query (they both are <40 dollars and have mn4 as an option)."

The authors introduce the concepts of Self-Asking, involving asking the model to ponder the task and options at hand, and trajectory ranking, which considers multiple rollouts from the language models and compares them using a \"critic\", which is a different LLM call, to find the best possible response.\n\nThe paper is organized as following: first, the interactive decision making tasks is introduced on which the rest of the paper is based on. Then, the authors introduce the two new components in this paper, namely self-asking, where the agent asks and answers a question about the task at hand, and trajectory ranking, where multiple natural language interactions are rolled out, and then the best trajectory is picked out by an LLM critic. The authors present a variety of experiments based on these premises, such as how different language models perform as the action model, and how well different critics (fine tuned vs. few shot prompted) perform against each other. The authors show that while it may not be very important to fine tune the actor, fine tuning the critic leads to clear improvements. The necessary ablations (such as: how well does each of these components perform by themselves?) are not marked separately, but included in the primary reported results tables."

The method of self-asking itself does not seem significant enough in and of itself without the trajectory ranking, and is quite similar to many different previous methods such as thinking step by step. Trajectory ranking is definitely the more interesting of the two components, but I am not sure it is a novel and significant enough contribution to merit a place in this venue.\n2. Following up on this, the work is beset by the fact that the new methods are only evaluated in two benchmarks only. While they perform well on the benchmarks, the question of how easy they will be to scale to a variety of other tasks remain unanswered from the paper itself.\n3. While there is a comprehensive study run on LLM critic and which language model is best for that task, it does not extend to the LLM actor itself. Rather, only two models of incredibly large sizes are used, which keeps the evaluation quite one-sided.\n\nOverall, this paper shows promise in a few direction, but does not make a noteworthy contribution in any of the directions in my opinion. However, given my limited experience in such works, I am happy to reconsider my take at the word of the area chair."

Broader baselines: I liked the authors ablations and comparison with React and its variants given the closeness of the approach (prospector) to react.  These were helpful in understanding how prospector's individual components improve performance. However, it would have been also useful to see how prospector's performance compares to other llm planning approaches e.g., the ones that combine llms + tree search/classical planning approaches such as https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08962.pdf to see how far does prospector push the performance. Lastly, given that prospector does some training for critics using example trajectories, I am wondering how the performance of prospector would compare to finetuned LLM planner/policy e.g., with LIMA (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206) which can be used to finetune LLM with limited data. Without these, right now, it is unclear whether prospector should be the goto planning approach for interactive decision making problems or is it really just a better version of react?"

I\u2019d encourage  the authors to do this for the sake of completeness. Likewise, it would be good to see prospector with react + trajectory ranking on webshop (table 7).\n- Table 5,8: Why is few-shot reward prediction accuracy of LLM critic lower with more shots (3-shot vs. 2-shot)?\n- It seems that Prospector would be slower than React or reflexion because of additional reasoning that it does using more LLM calls. For real world interactive decision making tasks, it might be useful for the authors to also report compute time needed to decide the next action during the task execution. To that end, it would be great to also add a limitation section.\n- What is the advantage of the LLM critic over a \u201clearnt\u201d critic which can take a policy rollout and provide a corresponding reward? Given that prospector is evaluated only in sim environment, why not use sim to learn such a critic? \n- The authors dont seem to cite or mention self-refine: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17651.pdf but that seemed very similar to self-asking in prospector too IMO. \n- Opensourcing plans?
