More importantly, the used layer-by-layer training scheme makes such three-layer neural network degenerate to a composition of two kernel methods (random features). With weight decay, the loss function under two stages is strongly convex and smooth. Both problem setting and algorithm are totally far away from true three-layer neural networks or even two-layer neural networks.\n\n- The results cannot handle the over-parameterized regime, i.e., the results require the width $m_1 << n$. The derived results set $m_1$ and $n_1$ depending on $d$, and $m_1$ and $n$ should have different orders of $d$. Otherwise the bound will become vacuous.

The main technical tool is that using the special structure assumed for the polynomials $p$ (Assumption 4), the paper provides an approximate version of Stein's Lemma (see Lemma 2), which can be used to show Item (i) from the above technical results.

It is unclear how this paper contributes in terms of novel ideas in that direction.\n- Overall, the architecture choice and algorithm makes the analysis straightforward. It reduces the problem to sequentially fitting two linear random feature models, which is by now quite well understood. See for example [Generalization error of random feature and kernel methods: Hypercontractivity and kernel matrix concentration, Mei et al., 2022] which gives the sample size and network width $\\Theta(d^k)$ to learn any degree-$k$ polynomials (for spherical data). The main technical innovation is Lemma 2, which relies on the specific construction of assumption 4. \n- For these reasons, I wonder how much this analysis can be generalized to other settings. Especially, in more realistic settings, we expect a non-linear evolution of the parameters, which this paper avoids using their specific architecture. In contrast, while [Nichani et al., 23] only considers one step size (so ultimately also a linear model step), they use a more standard architecture (but get a worse sample complexity dependency)."
