Therefore, how can authors justify that this figure is practical and can be trusted? This is important since all analysis is based on this basic assumption.\n2. I admire the effort to combine targeted augmentation with CR. But I do not think targeted augmentation is algorithmically novel since this is not general and hard to generalize to other datasets, given the wide popularity of DG in different applications. Therefore, the introduction of targeted augmentation is not efficient or general. This makes LAM deeply rely on the effectiveness of TA. I would like to know how can LAM be applied to other new domains where targeted augmentation is not realistic.\n3.

This paper proposes using consistency regularization on top of data augmentation; that is, enforcing similarities (at the logit, output, embedding level) on pairs of unaugmented and augmented samples. The paper provides a theoretical result stating that a model that is causal invariant (E.g. $\\hat{P}(Y | x) = \\hat{P}(Y | \\tilde{x})$) and minimizes loss in-distribution will also minimize out-of-distribution loss. The paper finally proposes a new form of consistency regularization, called logit attribution matching (LAM), which encourages feature matching on features that are strongly associated with the true label; this is more granular than previous approaches. The performance of consistency regularization on top of targeted data augmentation is compared to using standard data augmentation to expand the training dataset, and LAM is compared against other consistency regularization methods."

This model indicates that DG adheres to the concept of causal-invariant prediction, wherein the predicted labels for a semantic sharing pair remain consistent with diverse non-core factors, as long as the core factors remain unchanged. They then introduce a theorem of Conditions for Optimal DG and unveil consistency regularization as a potential optimal solution for DG, subject to certain assumptions. Existing methods, such as probability matching, logit matching, and feature matching, can all be treated as special cases of this optimal solution. The authors then develop the Logit Attribution Matching (LAM) regularizer, building upon the feature matching method. This approach introduces weights on each dimension of the features, corresponding to each label y. It is hoped that this design allows the model to pay more attention to core factors than non-core factors and improve OOD performance."

The theorem does not serve as a supporting foundation for the proposed logit attribution matching method. It seems that the theorem and the techniques are divided and tell two different stories. Concretely, the theorem just reveals that consistency regularization can be an optimal solution for DG. It is not connected to why logit attribution matching is needed to deal with core and non-core factors. Before this paper can be accepted, it is necessary that it undergoes revision to ensure a clear and concise explanation of how the theorem serves as a driving force behind the techniques employed."
