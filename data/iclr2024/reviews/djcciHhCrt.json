The authors should explain why they think it is feasible to stick to this setting. This is important given the fact that significant randomness during adversarial image training is observed.\n\n- The authors motivate the design of separate losses for response utility and tool invocation (i.e., Equation 2) based on the argument \u201cIn real-world conversational systems...we reduce the contribution of the loss term...\u201d First of all, there are comparisons validating the superiority of using such separate losses to the integrated loss (i.e., Equation 1). More specifically, the ablation studies clearly show using a large $\\lambda$, i.e. 1, works better, which conflicts with the argument about \u201creducing the contribution...\u201d.\n\n- It is said that \u201cthe l2 norm is computed with regard to each color channel separately\u201d. However, to the best knowledge of the reviewer, in the literature of adversarial examples, it is indeed computed not separately. Could the authors explain why they chose this unusual setting? \n\n- Considering that the threat model follows the typical prompt injection, it seems unnecessary to highlight its differences from \u201cjailbreaking\u201d. Therefore, the authors are encouraged to tune down some related claims. \n\n- The fact that only three images are tested should be mentioned in the main text rather than only in the appendix."

I suggest the authors also consider other VLMs like Minigpt-4 [1], Instruct-Blip [2], and LLaVA [3]. This can make the evaluation more convincing. \n\n2. **Lack of case studies on real LLM-integrated applications.**  The paper mentioned that LangChain and Guidance facilitate the development of such integrations. But, the paper did not provide a single instance of this to illustrate the practical risks of the proposed attack. In the whole paper, what the attack did was just to induce the generation of something like <function.delete_email which=\"all\"> in a purely textual form, which is essentially nothing different from previous NLP attacks that induced certain targeted generations. In my opinion, the novelty of this paper only comes from the illustration of the \"practical risks\" of such attacks --- because the resources controlled by LLMs can now also be missed to induce broader harms. However the paper did not provide a real example of this. The whole evaluation is still in a purely textual form, judging whether things like <function.delete_email which=\"all\"> are generated... In practice, the LLMs integrated systems may be more complicated than this conceptual form. The paper did not go deep into this. \n\n3. **Inaccurate Literature Review.** There is a factual error in the literature review. Qi et. al. [4] did not show transferability to closed-source models. On the other hand, Carlini et. al. [5] along with Qi et. al. [4] are earlier works showing the usage of visual adversarial examples to hack VLM, which may also need to be noted.\n\n\n\n[1] Zhu, D., Chen, J., Shen, X., Li, X. and Elhoseiny, M., 2023.
