However, they are either inconsistent or not explicitly defined. For example,\n    - Stereotypical keys vs. stereotyped keys\n    - Gender value vs. gendered value\n    - Also, what is grammatical gender?\n- About Equation 2, I have several questions\n    - What is z? Why do we need a $\\ell_2$ item on it?\n    - Missing a \u201c)\u201d somewhere in equation 2\n    - What is $P(o\u2019|X\u2019)$? The first two items in equations look similar to variational inference. In that case, $P(o\u2019|X\u2019)$ should be something similar to a prior distribution. However, I could not find its definition.\n- What is gender values metrics?  What is the relation between these V metrics and U?\n- Why $P$ in equation 5 is defined in that way, and how should we use it? I think it was explained in the paragraph right after equation 5, but I am not sure I understand it.\n- Figure 3 (b) seems to indicate that to reduce the bias, the cost is to get a much worse language model (based on the perplexity score), which is not exactly claimed in the paper.\n\nIn addition to my clarification question, one concern is about the technical novelty specifically the causal tracing idea is from prior work, and the linear project seems to be a straightforward idea in debiasing literature, so I am wondering what is the technical novelty of this work."

For WinoBias and SteroSet gender, I interpret the results as being still pretty gender biased even after applying DAMA. And for Bias in LM, for larger models, the a_s and a_f are still far from complete removal. It would help greatly to provide other gender bias removal methods as baselines to better assess how well DAMA did.\n2. I think the study on the effects of downstream is great. However, its negative effect on reasoning tasks such as ARC can be concerning for a practical user. Is there any hypothesis on why it doesn't fare well with reasoning type of tasks?"

It is currently unclear how much this is based on previous work and what exactly is the novel contribution. Please clarify this.\n\nIt is unclear why a linear model is fitted across the two gender scores in order to investigate the extent of bias. If the two scores are correlated (which they likely are) then the coefficients of such a linear model might not give accurate indications of the different biases. Measuring correlation with the gender scores seems like a much more straightforward method.\n\nAgain, for the method of updating weights, please clarify the difference of the proposed method to previous work, including Rafvogel et al 2022.\n\nA major selling point of the method seems to be that the proposed DAMA still achieves good performance on downstream tasks. However, the baseline MEMIT actually seems to get better results on most of this metrics. This finding somewhat weakens this claim and should be addressed in the paper."
