The approach eliminates the reliance on initial prompts and instead generates high-quality prompts from random noise using a conditional diffusion model. The authors conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and compare it to other prompt-tuning techniques. The results show that the Prompt Diffuser outperforms other methods regarding sample efficiency and generalization performance."

There appears to be a discrepancy in this viewpoint, as the subsequent sections of the paper emphasize the **accuracy** of generating prompts within the existing prompt distribution.
