                "value": "This paper address Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) by utilizing pseudo labels (PLs) from pretrained vision and language models (VLMs). Authors claim there are two main two challenges of using self-training in OVD: noisy PLs from VLMs and frequent distribution changes of PLs. Two key components: a split-and-fusion (SAF) head and a periodic update strategy are proposed for these challenges. The split-and-fusion (SAF) head splits a standard detection into an open-branch and a closed-branch, and the open-branch only supervised by classification loss without noisy bounding box. The periodic update strategy decrease the number of updates to the teacher, thereby decreasing the frequency of changes in PL distributions, which stabilizes the training process. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed modules."

However, it is not confirmed by any analysis. The periodic update strategy and the SAF head are indeed effective, but it does not mean that they work because they reduce the noise in pseudo labels. \n2. The ablation study does not reveal the entangled effects between components. For example, what if the baseline uses SAF head but does not use external RPN ((6) in Table 3 with (1))?\n3. The external region proposal network seems to be an empirical modification that is tried during experiments without specific motivations and analysis. This appears to be vital to make the framework (brings 6.0 AP of novel categories) but makes it unfair and not so elegant in comparison with previous works. Can the paper provide more analysis about it?"

Both semi-supervised object detection and source-free domain adaptive object detection belong to the field of self-training. This work didnot provide an in-depth discussion about the relation between the proposed methods and the existing self-training methods.

I believe the main issues with this paper are as follows:\n* Teacher-student self-training is a classic framework in semi-supervised object detection. However, the proposed periodic update strategy in this paper actually only modifies the frequency of teacher network updates, which lacks any innovation. In addition, the author claims that reducing the frequency of teacher network updates can decrease the frequency of changes in PL distributions, thereby stabilizing the training process. This is curious because this issue also exists in semi-supervised object detection, yet it does not have a similar effect in the ssod field. There is a lack of quantitative analysis here, and I believe this design deviates from the theme of open vocabulary object detection.\n\n* The overall framework appears particularly complex, making the paper difficult to understand.\n\n* In Figure 2b, open concepts enter the clip encoder through prompts, but how are these prompts designed? The paper does not provide a detailed explanation.\n\n* The paper details the use of an external RPN in the method section, which yields better results than F-VLM. However, the paper does not provide a detailed explanation of how the specific RPN is trained, whether it uses additional training data, and whether the RPN is within the main contributions of this paper. However, the paper spends a considerable amount of space introducing external RPN, which is confusing.\n\nBased on the aforementioned reasons, I believe that this paper requires improvement in terms of writing, experimentation, and organization to be accepted by ICLR. The current quality of the paper clearly does not meet the acceptance level of ICLR."
