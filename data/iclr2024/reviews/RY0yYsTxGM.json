Why can you give such definitions? Where are the learnable parameters of the graph transformer? If you have seen similar definitions, please give citations. Worse, you have given the equations (3) and (5), where are the necessities of Eq.(6)?  For Figure 5, it doesn't need to take up so much space.\n4. There is only one downstream task to evaluate your proposed pre-training model, Phi-former, and only 16,493 compound-protein pairs for training. Could you evaluate Phi-former on more tasks? Besides, in Table 1, point estimation is often random and inaccurate; could you give std values? \n5. The most incredible thing is in Section 4.2 Analysis, the authors say Phi-former demonstrates strong performance in both metrics, suggesting its effectiveness in the field of computer science English writing for the given task. What does this mean? Phi-former is proposed for COMPOUND-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS PREDICTION, and Table is the task related to binding affinity prediction. Why is it effective in the field of computer science English writing? \n6. From the descriptions in Appendix A.1, the node feature matrix X is obtained from the node embedding from the pre-trained Uni-Mol model [1]. X  is from a pre-trained model, and Phi-former is more like a fine-tuning model. Which dataset does the Phi-former pre-train? Why say it is a pre-training model?
