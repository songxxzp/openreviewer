This allows for a parametrically and computationally efficient alternative to ensembles. The experiments report improved performance over single deterministic networks and DDU on a range of in- and out-of-distribution uncertainty estimation tasks on various vision classification datasets.\n\nOverall, while the work achieves its aim of introducing a computationally efficient method, the paper does not compare to any competitive baselines despite a range of comparable methods having been introduced in recent years. In conjunction with no new technical material being introduced, I think the paper should be rejected."

DDU underperforms even the single net baseline on all non-MNIST benchmarks, on some of them by a large margin (CIFAR100 in Table 2, bottom panel of Fig 4). I don't know if DDU hasn't been tuned properly or simply isn't suited to tasks with a large number of classes, but in either case there are plenty of alternatives available in the literature that have reported good results in this setting, e.g. (Liu et al., Simple and Principled Uncertainty Estimation with Deterministic Deep Learning via Distance Awareness, Neurips 2020) or (Kristiadi et al., Posterior Refinement Improves Sample Efficiency in Bayesian Neural Networks, 2022).\n- the paper is a bit light on ablations. In particular the use of the spectral normalization is not justified empirically. From a theoretical standpoint, as far as I am aware, prior work has justified its need based on the network being distance preserving being necessary for the use of a distance aware output head, however I do not see the proposed method relying on this property, so I would like to see a baseline without spectral normalization. Similarly, the structure of the ensemble heads appears as a magic hyperparameter without justification. I realize that a linear head without hidden layers will probably underperform due to the categorical log likelihood being a convex/unimodal objective w.r.t. the weights of the linear output layer, but this should be justified explicitly and sensitivity of the method w.r.t. this hyperparameter evaluated.\n- the paper does not introduce any new technical material. This is in itself of course not grounds for rejection, combining prior work can be valuable, however I don't see any technical or theoretical contributions that would make up for the lacking empirical evaluation."

I have reservations below about some details of the model.\n- The idea makes sense, to increase diversity of ensemble heads by treating the like particles that repel to each other and explore different parts of the parameter/function space, this seems to be applied to ensembles and now the authors propose to use a ensemble with a shared representation network, which lowers the computation costs for inference time. This is important due to researchers and practitioners not using uncertainty estimation methods because of increased computational costs.\n- The selection of baselines seems to be appropriate, even as I make suggestions for better baselines in the minor comments. The paper compares against DDU and ensembles, DDU is a good and recent baseline for lightweight uncertainty estimation (using a single model), while ensembles is the state of the art for simple ways to obtain high quality uncertainty estimation.\n- The evaluation seems to be correct, the paper uses Dirty MNIST and CIFAR10/100 vs several out of distribution datasets, including out of distribution classification of incorrect predictions, and evaluates appropriate metrics: accuracy, expected calibration error, and AUROC for OOD detection.\n- Results indicate that the propsed method MH-POVI and MH-f-POVI performs closely to a ensemble and sometimes it outperforms DDU (also a single model) in terms of accuracy, calibration error, and out of distribution performance, often coming in 2nd place behind ensembles. I believe these results show that particle optimization for shared network ensembling is a viable strategy.\n- There is a good set of ablation results, varying the selection of context points (three) for the functional variant of MH-POVI, showing the effect of this parameter on performance, and also OOD detection on corrupted versions of CIFAR10 and 100, showing that MH-POVI and functional variant are closer to ensembles in performance loss than it is to DDU (which performs worse)."

I believe a fairer comparison is to equalize the number of ensemble networks and particles, or to evaluate both methods with a variable number of particles and ensemble members, which also would provide information about how both methods scale with the number of particles.\n- To me it is not clear what is the form of the loss function that is used to train the model. Equation 2 provides the update rule in the function space, and the paper argues that function particles are represented as neural networks, but then Equation 2 seems to use Equation 1 (in particular the v(f^i) ), but Equation 1 is for parameter-space, and to me it is not clear how to generalize the update rule to function space.\n\nMinor Comments\n- About multi-head architectures for uncertainty, there is also the concept of a sub-ensemble, which is very similar to the proposed method in this paper minus the particle optimization, it is meant to be an approximation to a deep ensemble, here I do not suggest a comparison but just integration into the literature for multi-head network architectures.\n\nValdenegro-Toro, M., 2023. Sub-Ensembles for Fast Uncertainty Estimation in Neural Networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 4119-4127).\n\n- In disentangled classification uncertainty, the authors use a decomposition of predictive entropy using the softmax entropy (aleatoric) and the mutual information (epistemic), could you include information or clarify, how the mutual information is computed for the ensemble heads?\n- Another suggestion for baselines, is to compare against more lightweight uncertainty quantification methods (currently only DDU), for example DUQ, Evidential Deep Learning, etc.\n- In Figure 3, I believe the paper has to say how to interpret these plots, that in the OOD setting ideally aleatoric uncertainty should be low and epistemic uncertainty should be high, while the in-distribution setting it is the opposite (epistemic low and aleatoric variable depending on samples).\n- In Section 3, please explain what is negative data augmentation, this term is not clear from the context of the paper and no citation for further information is provided."

                "value": "The authors propose a functional uncertainty quantification technique for neural networks based on particle representations which has the following core innovation: it attempts to share a backbone architecture and replace heads per particle.\n\nTaking things from the top, the authors embrace the particle-based VI literature in a functional view and combine it with spectral normalization to obtain smooth \"head\" representations and capture densities better.\n\nThey largely follow the path forged by D'Angelo and Fortuin, with minor modifications int he shared backbone and addition of spectral normalization which was explored heavily in DDU and other works that they attribute correctly.\n\nIn practice, the functional view trades off parameters for memory and data-constraints and becomes quasi-semi-parametric, so the authors also consider ways to generate useful \"context points\" to evaluate their functions so that the function-space kernel works correctly.\n\nThe performance of the technique seems fine evaluated over a variety of tasks where authors capture accuracy, in-distribution, and out-of-distribution metrics combined with parameter count."

            "strengths": {
                "value": "The paper proposes a combination of known techniques and architecture changes that ultimately works.\n\nThe idea of sharing backbones is sound and has been applied to ensembles before, and combining their heads with spectral normalization to create better density models is also a reasonable step aligned with many successful papers.\n\nFinally, the experiments indicate that their setup works well quantitatively with less parameters than other techniques that are as performant, and while not quite matching ensembles is oftentimes stronger than single-network uncertainty techniques."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I have a few concerns with this paper.\n\nFirst:\nThe proposed model is extremely close to D'Angelo and Fortuin . Pairing this with shared backbones and spectral normalization is sound, but also not particularly impressive as an addition to the exploration space here.\n\nSecond:\nThe authors do not show enough ablations of the role of each part of their model.\nHow would they compare against combinations of their individual variations with baselines?\nMore importantly: what does spectral normalization really buy here?\nHow much is the backbone the key thing?\n\nThird:\nThe authors evaluate a few different choices for their context dataset, but to my liking this is insufficient.\nIn their particle-based representation, parametric complexity is exchanged with evaluating context data, I will just call this a semi-parametric representation. As such, how much data is used for that semi-parametric representation and how that interacts with fidelity would be an important gradient to show here.\nHow stable is the model to varying that?\nWhich types of perturbations not heir images buy how much performance?\nMore importantly: the authors are proud of having reduced parameter count, but now require a battery of context data for each gradient step of their models. As such, evaluating how this interacts with memory requirements here is key.\n\nIn short: given that this paper jumps on the idea of representing BNNs functionally in a semi-parametric way, talking about the memory requirements for each type of computation and how that Pareto front varies seems as important as reporting the final parameter counts.\n\nThis might also help the authors justify their shared backbone more throughly: possibly the functional representation necessitates techniques to reduce memory footprint like shared backbones to more efficiently use GPU memory since the representation of f_backbone(context) is shared and as such does not incur memory overhead."
