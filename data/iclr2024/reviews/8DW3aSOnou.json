In Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, we see more details in the proposed method than in the compared methods. What is causing this to happen? \n\nI would be interesting to how the method performs if the basis functions were not used, but instead KPN is used like it is generally without any restrictions. Such an experiment would help determine the usefulness of using the high pass filters as basis.\n\nThe proposed method is not video-specific. The idea and solution both are more single image/ burst imaging specific. The authors are applying the idea in video deblurring domain, but the proposed method is not specific to this. Is there a reason this method applied specifically for video deblurring?"

In the third paragraph of Section 1, the authors state that integrating spatial and temporal gradients into a neural network for video deblurring leads to an improvement of 0.39dB. Where does the result come from?\n3. The authors mention several times that they utilize a set of predefined high-pass building kernels. How are these kernels predefined?  Are they the simple kernels defined in \u201cBuilding kernels\u201d? They are too simple to extract sufficient high-frequency information. What about learning these kernels?\n4. In the experiments, please add the comparisons with more recent methods, e.g.,\n[b] Li et al., A Simple Baseline for Video Restoration with Grouped Spatial-temporal Shift, CVPR 2023.\n[c] Liang et al., Recurrent Video Restoration Transformer with Guided Deformable Attention, NeurIPS 2022.\n5. Compared to the recent video deblurring methods, e.g., [b] and [c], the proposed method does not achieve the state-of-the-art performance, i.e., at least 1.97dB worse than [b] on the dataset ofGoPro and 1.11dB worse than [c] on the dataset of DVD.\n6.
