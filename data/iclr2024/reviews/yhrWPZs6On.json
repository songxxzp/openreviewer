                "value": "This paper proposes an approach to few-shot learning (FSL) called Hybrid Granularity Distribution Estimation (HGDE), which aims to improve the diversity and representativeness of training data for novel categories. While distribution estimation (DE) has proven effective in FSL by leveraging transferred statistics from similar base categories, it is limited by its coarse-grained estimation at the category level, which may lead to non-representative samples. HGDE addresses this issue by estimating distributions at both category and fine-grained instance levels. It incorporates fine-grained instance statistics from nearest base samples to provide a more representative description of novel categories, ultimately fusing statistics from different granularity levels using linear interpolation. Empirical studies on four FSL benchmarks demonstrate that HGDE significantly enhances the recognition accuracy of novel categories and has the potential to improve classification performance in other FSL methods."

This approach ensures that the generated additional samples for novel categories are not only diverse but also representative. This is crucial in FSL, where data availability for novel categories is limited.\n2.\tThe introduction of refinement techniques, such as weighted sum and eigendecomposition, enhances the accuracy of distribution statistics. This refinement process contributes to a more precise estimation of the mean and covariance statistics, which can lead to better model performance. \n3.\tThe paper highlights that HGDE can be applied to various FSL methods, indicating its flexibility and compatibility with existing FSL approaches."

In my opinion, this is affected by at least two factors, including the optimization of backbone in the pretraining stage and data distribution itself. In the experiments, I appreciate the authors choose to use figures to demonstrate the fidelity of generated features. However, I think it would be better to include some metric-based results on the whole dataset to measure the fidelity of generated features of the proposed method. I think the author needs to design some baselines to show that the proposed method is reasonable, e.g., distribution estimation based all samples in the datasets or random-selected samples.\n\n- The performance gain on recent work SMKT is not significant, why? Also, why the variance of your method is so big?\n\n- What are the extra computation and parameter costs of HGDE over DE?\n\n- Does this method can be applied into recent visual prompt methods?\n\n- I notice that the proposed method has a larger variance compared to the meta-baseline. It would be better to include some clarification."

Also, the category estimation has been explored in the community, and this degrades the contribution and novelty of this paper.\n\n3. In section 3.2.2, the top k most similar base samples are selected based on cosine distance, if the selected samples belong to the same class as the support prototypes, is it still reasonable for learning of the distribution, or even counterproductive?\n\n4. What are the pre-trained datasets of the chosen feature-extracting networks? Also, the increased time consumption for similarity calculation is not shown. It seems the proposed method does not need training, thus the title of Sec. 3.3 should be amended accordingly."
