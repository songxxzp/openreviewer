It also identifies specific \"space neurons\" and \"time neurons\" within these models, indicating that LLMs form structured knowledge about space and time.

The identification of specific \"space neurons\" and \"time neurons\" within these models is an innovative aspect to understand LLMs.\n3.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. One of the paper's limitations is its potential overlap with findings already established in the word embedding literature. Earlier works in this area, such as those by Mikolov et al. (2013), have demonstrated that simpler word embedding models can capture relational information and regularities in a linear fashion. This raises the question of whether the findings in this paper are genuinely novel or simply an extension of what is already known about linear representations in language models. The paper could strengthen its contribution by more directly addressing how its findings with large language models (LLMs) differ significantly from those with simpler models, and by delving deeper into the implications of these differences for the field.\n2. The assertion that LLMs learn literal 'world models' may be overstated. The concept of a 'world model' in the context of AI and cognitive science typically refers to a comprehensive and dynamic representation of the external world, including an understanding of causal relationships and the ability to predict future states. The paper's findings, while impressive, primarily demonstrate that LLMs can encode spatial and temporal information linearly. This is a far cry from the richer and more dynamic conception of a world model. A more accurate claim might be that LLMs are capable of forming structured and useful representations of spatial and temporal information, but these do not necessarily constitute comprehensive world models. Further exploration into how these representations are utilized by LLMs in real-world tasks, and how they compare to human cognitive processes, could provide a more nuanced understanding of their nature and limitations.\n3. Though the analysis experiments are useful and abundant within the given datasets and LLMs, the scope of data and experiments is limited. In particular, the datasets used, while diverse, primarily represent well-known entities and locations. This could limit the generalizability of the findings to less common or more ambiguous entities. The study largely focuses on data in English and from a Western perspective. Exploring how these models represent space and time in other languages and cultural contexts could provide valuable insights into their versatility and limitations. Also, the study is conducted on the Llama-2 model family. Testing the findings across different models and architectures would strengthen the argument that these capabilities are inherent to LLMs in general, rather than specific to a particular model."

It would be helpful if the authors can explain more about why they think that the LLM learning these properties is a sign of learning a world model.\n\nW3. Only results from probing experiments are provided as evidence, and only when either the entity is given directly to the model as input or when a prompt that agrees with the task is appended to the context (\"What is the location of..\"). It would be informative to present the accuracy of the model under those prompts (e.g. is the probing needed to answer the question of whether the model has this information?), and also to show whether the representation of time and space is still decodable even if the task the model is asked to perform is not related to the time/location or is even adversarially related."
