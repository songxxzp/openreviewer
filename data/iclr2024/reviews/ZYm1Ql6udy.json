The inference is performed by MCMC with the Polya-Gamma technique. In the experiments, the authors evaluate their method on both simulated data and neural recordings."

A theoretical proof of the model identifiability along with all necessary conditions seems important here, given the vast number of parameters.\n2. The MCMC algorithm has incorporated all the most modern efficient MCMC techniques, including the Polya-Gamma augmentation, Miller&Harrison sampler for mixture of finite mixtures, FFBS for state space models, etc. The effort here is worth being recognized. However, for both the simulation and application, the MCMC sampler is run for only 1000 iterations. I am concerned of whether the MCMC sampler has really converged given its complexity and the vast amount of model parameters. If it has indeed converged, it would be nice to present trace plots of parameters and also conduct MCMC convergence diagnosis (e.g. using Gelman-Rubin or Geweke statistics).\n3. There are some typos in the paper and some terms undefined, e.g. \n    - the distribution \\mathcal{S} in equation (4) is only given in the appendix\n    - in the first paragraph of Sec 2.1, where \\log\\mu_{i, t} = d_i + \\tilde{c}' \\tilde{x}_t^{(z_i)} has missing subscript i in \\tilde{c}.\n\nThe general idea of this paper and the designed MCMC sampler are both quite nice. I would be willing to raise the rating by one or two levels if the points 1 and/or 2 can be fully addressed."

The simulation study is a little bit too simple, with only one parameter setting, and there are no comparisons to the state-of-the-art methods.   I would suggest investigating three things: (1) the sensitivity of the bin sizes; (2) how the estimation performances change when the number of nodes and the Time length increases; (3) compared to some existing methods in terms of the predictive performances (one may consider using cross-validations.)\n\n3. In the real data analysis, the authors argue that it is necessary to use the biclustering algorithm. However, no comparison to any existing method is given.  Similar to the simulation studies, I suggest comparing the predictive performance of the proposed algorithm to some existing methods.\n\n4. In the simulation study, there is no histogram in Figure 3(c). Could you please clarify?\n\n[1] Xu, H., & Zha, H. (2017). A dirichlet mixture model of hawkes processes for event sequence clustering.
