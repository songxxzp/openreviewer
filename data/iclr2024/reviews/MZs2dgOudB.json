In section 3.2, the paper proposes to use penultimate layer of the initialization neural net as the features for active context selection, but this important detail is only mentioned midway through that section. \n\nThe choice of Gaussian Mixture Selection is not adequately explained, and the paper fails to discuss its advantages compared to other clustering algorithms."

The paper starts with an analysis of where in the meta-learning process active learning can be applied, along with a concise review of meta-learning and active learning methods. Empirical evidence is presented to demonstrate that actively selecting context points during meta-training does not significantly impact meta-learning but does prove beneficial during meta-testing. In this context, the authors propose a Gaussian Mixture Model-based acquisition function, which stands as the primary technical contribution of this paper. In essence, this method employs meta-trained features to model a mixture of k Gaussian distributions, with k equating to the label budget, often referred to as batch size in active learning. The empirical results, based on experiments conducted across four few-shot image datasets, indicate that the proposed GMM-based acquisition strategy outperforms other acquisition strategies when integrated into meta-testing."
