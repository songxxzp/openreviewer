                "value": "This paper introduces Constrained MCTS (C-MCTS), an MCTS-based novel approach for solving CMDP decision-making tasks. This approach avoids constraint violations by pre-training a safety critic before agent deployment with TD learning using simulator data. The pre-trained safety critic eliminates the need for tuning a Lagrange multiplier online. The experiments in two environments, Rocksample and Safe Gridworld, show that C-MCTS outperforms existing approaches. It prunes unsafe branches of the search tree during deployment, achieving higher rewards while ensuring safety. Most importantly, it is less susceptible under the model mismatch between the simulator and the real-world environment."

In the expansion of C-MCTS, the safety critic is used to evaluate all actions. This greatly increases the computing resources when applying in the large action space domains or using more MCTS simulations. In addition, considering C-MCTS uses additional resources to tune a Lagrange multiplier, the comparison between C-MCTS and CC-MCP is unfair. The authors should provide the detailed time complexity for C-MCTS, and the time for the pre-training phase for comparison.\n\nSecond, the experimental environments are quite simple, so it is hard to convincingly evaluate the out-of-distribution scenarios where states are completely unseen during deployment. The author should add experiments on more complex environments, e.g., the MuJoCo physics simulator."

Furthermore, CC-MCP searches deeper than C-MCTS in Rocksample(11, 11).\n\nThe experiments themselves also do not seem. Maybe I'm missing something but it seems, that C-MCTS gets extra computations.
