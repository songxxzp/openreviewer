Although the paper extends the approach proposed by Menon & Vondrick (2022), the core novelty primarily stems from a change in the prompt to acquire more distinctive category descriptions. While this change is interesting, it also brings a substantial increase in computational complexity, transitioning from a linear to a quadratic scale. Despite the proposed scheme to mitigate this complexity, the fundamental nature of the method remains computationally more demanding, which may limit its scalability."

How is the number of attributes determined? Is it dynamic or fixed?\n- More ablation experiments are needed. The paper directly uses pairwise description contrasting for some coarse label datasets. For other datasets, how effective is the simple pairwise description contrasting? Is it necessary to use attributes?\n- The paper contains some minor errors:\n    - Inconsistent descriptions. For instance, \"remove {attribute_name}\"(the second to last paragraph on page 8) does not correspond to the description in Table 4.\n    - The layout of figures.

Given the limited extent of the performance improvements, it is advisable for the author to delve further into the analysis. Similar to [1], the author should consider including instances of failure cases generated by LLM. This addition would offer valuable insights for a more thorough understanding of the method's strengths and limitations.\n\n[1] Sachit Menon and Carl Vondrick.
