It suggests a strategy for balancing accuracy and coverage by abstaining from predictions in situations where errors can be costly. The proposed approach involves creating a concept bottleneck model, enabling the front-end model to use soft concepts and improving coverage and performance through concept confirmation. The paper presents techniques for handling uncertainty and pinpointing concepts for confirmation."

In the introduction, the authors emphasize the significance of interpretability and the challenges it poses in achieving high accuracy. By including these vital points in the abstract, the paper can provide a more comprehensive overview of its content and contributions.\n\n2. Regarding the abstention process, it appears to be based on a prediction probability threshold, where if the probability is lower than the threshold, the prediction is abstained? How does it different from a decision threshold used by the models? Can authors clarify that?\n\n3. In the results and discussion section, there's limited exploration and commentary on the impact of the solution on system accuracy, as seen in Table 2. Notably, the confirmation budget appears to have a limited effect on datasets like \"noisyconcepts25\" and \"warbler\" compared to others. The paper can delve into the reasons behind this discrepancy.\n\n4. In real-world applications of this solution, questions about the ease of concept approval and handling conflicting user feedback arise. While these aspects may be considered out of scope, addressing them would be beneficial for evaluating the practicality of implementing this approach in real-world scenarios. This is particularly important when considering the potential challenges of user feedback and conflicting inputs in such applications.\n\nMinor things:\nPage 4, confirm. we \u2014> replace . with comma\nSection 4.2, Table Table 2 \u2014> Table 2\nShouldn\u2019t Table 2 rather be labelled as Figure 2?"

The conceptual bottleneck approach trains a classification model for each concept identified in the training data. The end-model is a classifier that uses the presence or absence of concepts to make the target classification. The abstain mechanism allows the end-model to abstain from prediction.  When the model is uncertain about the presence of a concept, it may query the user for confirmation, thereby increasing trust and performance. Concept uncertainies are propagated through the end-model by using concept identification model scores as probabilities and sampling over potential concept vectors. This also improves performance."
