Unlike previous data-driven methods, EATS presents itself as an optimization-based method, where it encourage all neurons within an existing SISR framework to actively collaborate in solving the generalization problem by randomly perturbing response of inhibited neurons and maximize their contributions to prediction. EATS consists of two steps: (1) **Erasing step**, where it randomly samples a disruptor filter $n_l^{dis}$ and applies it towards a randomly selected erased filter $n_l^{ear}$ in the network's $l^{th}$ layer and assess performance before-and-after the erasure ($f_{\\theta}$ and $f_{\\theta'}$), and (2) **Awakening step**, where an awakening regularization term $\\mathcal{L}\\_{awa}$ is employed to close the gap between predicted high-resolution image and the low-resolution image from the disrupted network $f_{\\theta'}$. Besides providing theoretical proof to show the effectiveness of EATS in improving the Shapley value of the network, experiments on multi-degradation settings within various unseen datasets have demonstrated that plugging EATS into SISR algorithms such as SRResNet and RRDBNet results in quantitatively and qualitatively better images than baselines."
