Through Koopman theory, time series of different distributions can be sent to Koopman space through an appropriate measurement function, and this Koopman space can be expressed as linear Koopman operators. Considering Koopman's linearity and Koopman operator, different time series distributions can be converted to Koopman operators. It can be decomposed into linear combinations. This is called the meta-koopman operator. In particular, it is said that the TDS problem can be eliminated because it linearly combines meta Koopman operators for time series modeling in different distributions."
