However, the code that is currently available (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cod-bench-7525) is lacking a basic README with minimal guidelines for a user interested in using the package. It will be beneficial to accompany the code with proper documentation as well as detailed examples as common for many scientific code packages (see next point). \n2. Related work: it would be beneficial for the authors to relate to existing code alternatives and or attempts to study data-driven models. For example, DeepXDE (lu et al. 2021) is a code package that contains most of the components of CoDBench and further allows more flexibility in terms of data construction. \n3. Overall contribution: the authors present as major contributions the analysis of Super-resolution as well as out-of-distribution tasks (stress and strain) however both are presented in earlier works for studying data-driven models and benchmarked against baselines (e.g. Fanaskov et al. 2022 and Rashid et al. 2022). Hence while it is beneficial to analyze these at a broader scale over all 11 models the scope of this contribution is limited. Following this, the key insight, limitations, and future work suggested appear minimal in terms of scope and practicality.\n4. Minor: Figure 1 is never referenced. It will be beneficial to change the coloring of optimal values in tables and or underline the second best to have better discrimination between second and third."

Can the authors comment on the limitation of their study for the ood evaluation. PDEs solution can exhibit very different behavior with the same equation varying the initial condition, notably for fluid dynamics data. Such a test could strengthen the analysis proposed by the authors.\n\n3. The error in the super resolution settings seems to explode. Can the authors comment on the results they report in the paper ?\n\n4. While it is very difficult to be exhaustive in such a study, testing all the literature is unfeasible, I strongly encourage the authors to include an extensive discussion on why they chose the selected models or at least why they chose not to select other models.
