The analysis is based on the XM3600 dataset, and a collection of recently proposed models including LLaVA, BLIP2, GIT, and the Google Vertex API. Each of these models is used to generate image captions in seven languages, after which the original non-English output is translated into English using GPT-4. The analysis is broken down into looking at the complexity of the scene graph, representational diversity, linguistic diversity, and ground-truth coverage. The main claim, across all of these analyses, is that multilingual captions -- translated into English -- increase the diversity of the objects, relations, and linguistic complexity, compared to English-only captions."

There is no explanation of possibly failed attempts to use non-English parsers or text embedding. Given the lack of meaningful discussion on this part, it is unclear whether this could infact work using the non-English languages directly. \n\nThe main claims of the paper are about how different languages can be shown to express things differently. However, the only example of the differences between English and non-English text, shown in Table 16 in the Appendix, has two dubious examples of the type of diversity found in translated versions of other languages. From these examples and the comments, it looks like the non-English captions include entities that are synonymous with other English entities (see Question 2.)\n\nThe related work section neglects to discuss many years of prior work in multilingual multimodal research, including but not limited to Wang et al.

In Section 3.1, you write \"we require the consistent application of linguistic tools, such as parsers, which are more mature for English than other languages\".\n2. What are the main types of differences driving the differences in different non-English translated text? What types of objects or entities are being created? The examples in Table 16 are not so convincing to me: \"alleyway\" can be synonymous with \"street\", while \"screen\" can be synonymous with \"monitor\".\n3. Why did you use the GPT-4 API instead of a dedicate machine translation model, such as M2M-100 or NLLB? I could not find any justification for not using a translation model in the paper.\n4. Why are the final conclusions reliable when you have used a machine translation tool to convert the non-English text into English text?\n5. What are the actual benefits of the Google Vertex API? The paper describes that the \"outputs reflect established standards and have gone through quality checks\" but I don't understand what that is supposed to mean.\n6. How much money was spent on API calls? This would be useful for future researchers to know in attempting to reproduce your results."

Utilising these metrics, they conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various existing datasets, including those generated by models and commercial API image descriptions.\n\nThe results suggest the significant impact of language and culture on image description, revealing that individuals from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds tend to highlight distinct semantic content within images. Additionally, models trained on monolingual datasets demonstrate optimal results when tested in the same language, whereas those trained on multilingual data consistently exhibit robust performance across a diverse range of test sets. This phenomenon underscores the extent to which linguistic differences in image descriptions are internalised and reproduced by the models."

Given this potential limitation, a more cautious and nuanced articulation of these conclusions might be more suitable.\n\n- Some segments of the research are founded on datasets of relatively modest size. For instance, the dataset analysis is based on 30 descriptions across two languages (English & Japanese), contributed by 10 individuals per language. This sample size may not fully encapsulate the breadth of diversity and nuance inherent to linguistic expression, potentially limiting the representativeness of the findings."

Even though you've included a step for canonicalization, can you confirm whether this process accurately aligns 100% of identical concepts? Is it possible that some concepts from multilingual sources, once translated to English, are interpreted as slightly different, leading to inflated diversity scores?\n\n* On a related note, I tend to think that translation inherently introduces linguistic diversity, as it's rarely perfectly accurate. For instance, back translation is a popular method for data augmentation, despite the expectation that the core semantic content should remain consistent. Could you address the possibility that the observed differences in your study are simply artifacts of the translation process? I understand that human evaluation was conducted for GPT-4 translations, but subtle nuances may still have been overlooked."
