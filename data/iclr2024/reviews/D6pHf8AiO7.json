They claim that the best-performing pruning techniques use second-order methods for importance estimation. However, due to the size of modern neural networks, these methods are computationally too expensive. To address this limitation, the authors introduce FishLeg surgeon (FLS). The core idea is to leverage an accumulation of the gradients instead of storing them individually. This is achieved through tensor decomposition for an effective approximation. The authors mainly evaluate the proposed method on ResNet 50 trained on ImageNet."

For example, if the proposed importance metric (Eq. 4) is indeed superior than that from a competing method, e.g. OBC, then it is necessary to show the disagreement between them with a concrete example, e.g. a specific layer in Resnet50, where the optimal solutions in one is suboptimal in the other, but the current solution leads to lower loss change."
