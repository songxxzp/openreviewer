For the outliers, SpQR preserves them in FP16 with an unstructured format using an indices matrix. SpQR provides details on the implementation of both encoding and decoding algorithms. Experimental results show competitive performance on next-token generation tasks in language modeling, such as Wikitext2, C4, PTB with Falcon, and LLaMA. Notably, the provided GPU inference algorithm exhibits faster latency compared to 16-bit baselines while maintaining similar accuracy."

                "value": "1. *Evaluation Benchmarks:* While the authors have acknowledged this in their limitations, the absence of performance evaluations on trendy benchmarks for generative models (such as MMLU, mathematical reasoning performance like GSM8K, or coding abilities such as humaneval) represents a weakness. Evaluating at least one of these benchmarks is crucial to better ascertain the proposed algorithm's effectiveness.  \n2. *Quantization Baselines:* SpQR demonstrates good accuracy using a very small group size. Therefore, I kindly suggest comparing it with baselines like RTN, GPTQ [1] and AWQ [2] by applying a group size. While it's important to compare accuracy at identical bit-width levels, it's equally crucial to evaluate inference latency at the same accuracy level. In this context, SpQR might offer reduced memory usage. Since SpQR introduces a new representation by combining dual quantization with sparse outliers, it's essential to provide a presentation that underscores the advantages of SpQR in relation to conventional methodologies.\n3. *Inference Time:* SpQR employs a two-stage quantization process to utilize a very small group size, allowing for fine-grained representation and enhancing accuracy through the use of sparse representation for outliers. While it is evident that this proposed method will yield very positive results in terms of accuracy, there is a growing concern that the associated latency overhead needs to be better managed. In other words, the method presents a well-analyzed problem statement combined with easily understandable techniques that have high accuracy. However, it seems to have a weakness in the latency overhead of the two-stage quantization with such a small group size and the latency overhead for the sparse representation of outliers. Therefore, it would have been more beneficial if there had been a more varied presentation of the latency results, which arise from combining sparse matrix multiplication with quantization matrix multiplication. Specifically, in the \"Inference Time\" section and paragraph, the speed of the end-to-end proposed algorithm is measured. However, it would have been a better presentation if the latencies without sparse outliers and with sparse outliers were both disclosed, allowing readers to recognize the performance trade-off easily. To delve into more specifics, when sparse outliers are excluded, there should be a new baseline (such as existing prior kernels [1, 2] for weight-only quantization) comparing the latency of the quantized model where the proposed two-stage quantization has been applied. Furthermore, discussing the additional overhead when introducing sparse outliers after such a comparison would have been an excellent addition.  \n\nIdeally, to assess the performance of SpQR, it would enhance clarity if the author could specify the difference in accuracy when comparing the proposed SpQR to 4-bit group-wise methods like RTN, GPTQ [1], and AWQ [2]. At the same time, understanding the inference latency of SpQR, especially given its very small group size in comparison to these 4-bit group-wise weight-only quantization methods, would be beneficial. Lastly, highlighting its memory efficiency would further improve the clarity.  \n\n[1] Frantar, Elias, et al. \"OPTQ: Accurate quantization for generative pre-trained transformers.\" The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations. 2022.  \n[2] Lin, Ji, et al. \"AWQ: Activation-aware Weight Quantization for LLM Compression and Acceleration.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978 (2023)."
