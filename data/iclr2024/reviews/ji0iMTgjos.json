                "value": "This paper intends to give novel insights for Micro-AUC optimization in multi-label classification. To this end, three types of surrogate losses are theoretically analyzed: (1) a classical univariate loss commonly used in MLC, (2) a pairwise loss commonly used in AUC optimization, and (3) a reweighted univariate loss that is in accordance with oversampling the minority class. \n\nThe authors derive generalization bounds for the three types of loss functions. To this end, a new quantity is introduced: the matrix-wise class imbalance of an MLC dataset. The results show that the traditional univariate loss is inferior to the other two losses. The last two losses are competitive, so each of them could be good choices to train an MLC classifier. In addition, the authors also present some experimental results that confirm the theoretical results."

                "value": "I didn't spot any big weaknesses in this paper. However, I have to admit that I am not a \"bound prover\", so I was unable to check the correctness of the proofs. \n\nSome aspects in which the paper could be further improved are:\n1. The key findings look very similar to the following paper: W. Kotlowski et al. Bipartite Ranking through Minimization of Univariate Loss, ICML 2011. That paper is not discussed. What's novel compared to the findings in that paper?\n\n2. There are three ways of doing averaging for AUC and other multivariate loss functions: micro-averaging, macro-averaging and instance-wise averaging. Of those three, I have always felt that micro-averaging is the least important in applications. Are there actually applications where this form of averaging is relevant? I cannot think of such an application. \n\n3. Are the results immediately extendable to the other types of averaging? \n\n4. Micro-, macro and instance-wise averaging are also used in other multi-target prediction settings, such as dyadic prediction and matrix completion. Are the results immediately extendable to such settings?\n\n5. Is a similar type of analysis possible for other multivariate loss functions, such as F-measure, PR-AUC, Jaccard, etc.? \n\nI do understand that the authors cannot answer all these questions in a single paper, but extending the related work section in that direction would be useful. \n\nSmall remark on the notation: The definition of the sets S^+, S^-, S^+_i, S^-,i looks a bit awkward. I think that you can simply write S^+ = {(p,i) | y_pi = 1} etc."

Micro-AUC. This paper identifies the matrix-wise class imbalance and shows that the commonly-used univariate loss-based algorithm has a worse learning guarantee than the ones with the proposed pairwise and reweighting univariate loss theoretically. Moreover, the experiments are consistent with their theory."

This paper proposes two new surrogate losses, but the natural surrogate pairwise loss takes too much time to converge from the experiments. The reweighted univariate loss is also based on the widely-used ordinary univariate loss.\n2. The Related Work is the 6th session, which is not common. I am wondering if there is any specific reason for putting Related Work there."
