However, their performance in many-shot retrieval problems, where abundant training data is available, such as extreme multi-label classification (XMC), has received limited attention. Existing evidence indicates that dual-encoder methods tend to underperform compared to state-of-the-art extreme classification methods that scale the number of learnable parameters linearly with the number of classes in such tasks. Some recent extreme classification techniques combine dual-encoders with a learnable classification head for each class to excel in these scenarios. This paper explores the potential of \"pure\" dual-encoder models in XMC tasks and provides insights for XMC."

In previous work using softmax loss functions, the presence of other positive classes decreases the negative loss that can be gained from a training example. This work considers decoupled softmax, in which the negative loss gained for each positive class is independent of other positive classes. The motivation for this new loss function is that some classes may \"obviously\" apply, which should lead to confident predictions for those \"obvious\" cases. In experiment with synthetic dataset where one of the samples is very obviously marked, both softmax and decoupled softmax methods latch on this obvious annotations early on, but standard softmax approaches then entice the model to give the same score to all positive samples, obvious or not, thus decreasing the model's confidence in the obvious case. In non-synthetic settings, decoupled softmax reduces the variance in gradient feedback.\n\nDirectly training with the full decoupled softmax loss is challenging when there are many labels: appendix presents how to do this training with the full loss in a memory-efficient way. Still, for higher number of labels (e.g., documents retrieval), there is a need to approximate this full loss, and some preliminary results are given in this direction. A natural extension is presented for SoftTop-k.\n\nThe Appendices were not considered as part of this review."

However, there could be multiple such documents that contain the desired answer: this retrieval task can be understood as a particularly extreme case of XMC.

Here's my own crude attempt at it: please complement it, clarify any disagreements, and propose edits to the manuscript.\n\n- 1(a) There are a large number of classes, and many of them can apply to the same sample. The models being considered are DE where the representations from each encoder will be converted to a score using an inner product.\n- 1(b) OvA-BCE won't train; InfoNCE disincentivizes confident predictions.\n- 1(c) Decoupled softmax both trains and allows for confident predictions.\n\n\n### 2\nThe bulk of the manuscript presumes the optimization of the the \"full\" loss function over all positive and negative classes. Is this standard practice in the XMC community? Some experiments sampling hard negatives are presented in Section 5.4, but there is no real discussions besides \"more is better\". Do you have any insights to add? Could those be added to the manuscript?\n\n\n*The remaining points are more minor*\n\n### 3\nFigure 1: why express the x axis in millions, instead of replacing the $10^2$ and $10^3$ ticks by $10^8$ and $10^9$?\n\n### 4\nPlease avoid notations such as \"O(100)\", \"O(million)\" and \"O(billion)\".\n\n### 5\nFigure 2: \"Precision@1\" here has a special meaning. There are 5 samples that are marked as positives, but one of them is \"more positive\", and \"Precision@1\" here means \"the more positive sample must be in first position\". This special setting is relatively clear in the text, but looking quickly at Figure 2 and its caption can be misleading. Please consider inventing a different term/notation.\n\n### 6\nThere are multiple missing punctuations after mathematical expressions. For example, a period should be added at the end of the first paragraph of Section 3, and another one should be added after the equation at the bottom of page 4. As a side note, I would personally add a lot of commas to the English text, but I understand that this may be more a matter of style.\n\n### 7\nThe text appears to use \\cite or \\citep everywhere, but many should actually be \\citet. For example, in the second paragraph of Section 4.2, \"similar to (Xiong et al., 2021)\" should become \"similar to Xiong et al. (2021)\", and \"in (Lindgren et al., 2021)\" should be \"in Lindgren et al. (2021)\".\n\n### 8\nThe style of the stackexchange citation in the paragraph following Equation (6) should be revised. Personally, I would have expected something like \"... on a proposal by Ahle (2022).\"\n\n### 9\nSome variables are overloaded; for example $d$ is used both for documents and dimensions. I thought that there were more cases, but I can't find them anymore, so I may be confused with another paper. Please check."
