                "value": "**Limited novelty**\n- It is noted that the primary focus of this paper is to interpret score distillation sampling using the Stein identity and to reduce variance through the incorporation of monocular depth estimation. However, Kim et al [1] have already discussed a similar interpretation of the Stein identity and the importance of baseline function selection for convergence and efficiency. Although the specific focus of Kim et al. is different (visual editing), the core inspiration appears to be similar. Therefore, it is recommended for the authors to acknowledge and discuss the already incorporated findings of Kim et al. In this context, while the inclusion of monocular depth estimation for efficient text-to-3D synthesis is intriguing, the novelty of the proposed method may be considered weak. Thus, given the similarities in findings and interpretation, the distinguishing factor appears to be only the choice of baseline functions for specific tasks, the adoption of a monocular depth estimator as the control variate. \n\n**Lack of Quantitative Evaluation**\n- To support their claims of qualitative improvement over Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and Variational Score Distillation (VSD), the authors should provide a quantitative evaluation. Although the video demonstration provided by the authors indicates some improvement, issues such as the \"Janus problem\" in the dog statue are still present. While Figure 5 does demonstrate a reduction in variance compared to other methods, it does not necessarily guarantee improved quality. Figure 5 suggests that SSD reduces variance during training when compared to other methods, which may lead to fewer artifacts at similar training iterations, especially in comparison to ProlificDreamer. However, quality improvements are not guaranteed after fully training ProlificDreamer until convergence, as fine-tuning the diffusion model may require more computational time. Hence, it is recommended that the authors claim that the proposed method effectively reduces variance during training, which ensures better quality at an \u201cearly stage\u201d not overall quality improvements. This concept is also supported by Figure 7 (although additional figures may be necessary for validation, just one example is severely not enough), clearly indicating that the reduced variance achieved by the proposed method results in faster convergence rather than overall quality improvement.\n- Additionally, the comparison in the paper appears to be based on a limited number of samples. It is beneficial to conduct experiments with a broader range of prompts to assess the robustness of the proposed method in reducing variance.\n\n[1] Kim et al., Collaborative Score Distillation for Consistent Visual Editing.
