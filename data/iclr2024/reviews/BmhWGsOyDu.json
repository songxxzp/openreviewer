The learning objective is to find a universal policy $u(t)$ for a massive number of agents, where each agent is characterized by a type parameter $\\beta \\in \\varOmega$ that follows a known distribution, and the dynamics of an agent with type may be dependent on its type $\\beta$. To solve the proposed problem, the paper proposes a hierarchical algorithm that leverages a novel moment kernel representation for group systems, with convergence guarantee and detailed simulation results in a specific LQR system."

What is the motivation for considering such a special setting?\n    * It's hard to consider a setting where there are a massive number of agents, each follows a (potentially different) *type-dependent dynamics*, yet all of them share a common policy $u(t)$ that is *type-independent*.\n    * The paper fails to sufficiently motivate the new setting. Though it seems that the authors are willing to provide an example in Section 2.2, the link is dead and nor can the reviewer find it in the appendix.\n    * The agent type follows a uniform distribution over $\\varOmega$, which hardly makes any sense. For large-scale systems at least a known distribution $\\mu$ over $\\varOmega$ should be considered. Will this make the results significantly different (better or worse)?\n2. Why is this referred to as RL?\n    * Terminology-wise, RL specifically refers to the learning-based solutions to MDPs or Markov games. Not all sequential decision-making problems with rewards fall into the category of RL.\n    * There is no learning involved in the proposed setting. All components are known, including the system dynamics, the agent types (in this case, the distribution of types) and rewards. The formulation can be regarded as a planning problem at best.\n    * To qualify the algorithm as \"learning\", at least some component should be initially unknown, and inferred from data collected along the trajectory. \n3. Why is the hierarchical moment-kernel-based algorithm necessary?\n    * The introduction of the moment kernel technique is not motivated. What's the fundamental challenge of the problem? Why the moment kernel technique helps to settle it? Now it appears to the reviewer that the authors just randomly select a fancy approach.\n    * Even for the moment kernel, the usage of Chebyshev polynomials in the exemplary setting is not motivated as well. Can other moment kernels be used in place of it? How does it impact the performance?\n    * It is unclear why the algorithm needs to be hierarchical. Is it a simple binary-lifting technique to find a truncation that yields an error below threshold? It is even not clear which part of the algorithm is \"hierarchical\", and in what sense.\n4. Why bother to include a detailed analysis of a specific system?\n    * It is not convincing enough to show the correctness and performance of the proposed algorithm via an analysis of *one* specific artificially-designed system.\n    * If the paper is application-oriented, please include the modelling of a real-world use case and show the end-to-end performance.\n    * If the paper is theory-oriented, please include theoretical guarantees of the algorithm under mild assumptions (e.g., regret bounds, sample complexity, etc.).\n5. The paper does not include sufficient literature review and discussion about the results to let the reviewer see the significance of the results."

This approach allows for RL problems to be framed in a functional setting, making it applicable to massive-scale populations of agents, regardless of their size.\n\n2. The authors use a moment kernel representation for group systems. This representation provides a new way to understand and analyze the behavior of these populations, enhancing the modeling and control of large agent populations.\n\n3. The paper presents a hierarchical RL algorithm for group systems. The hierarchy here is different from, say, goal-based reinforcement learning settings. The moment sequence can be truncated at a given order, and the truncated sequences are called \"hierarchy\". This is more like an approximation algorithm.\n\nIn summary, the paper addresses the challenge of coordinating massive populations of intelligent agents and offers a comprehensive framework for RL in group systems, including a moment kernel representation and an approximation algorithm."

                "value": "1. (Major) While the paper presents an intriguing framework for reinforcement learning in the context of coordinating large populations of intelligent agents, several aspects related to its applicability warrant critical examination. The reviewer has concerns about the representational power of the moment kernel introduced.  Its limitations and practical applicability to real-world scenarios remain unclear. Furthermore, the focus of the experimental evaluation is on Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR). While LQR is undoubtedly a valuable benchmark problem in control theory, it does not reflect the diverse range of applications for which this framework is purportedly designed. The absence of experiments on scenarios and the limited scope of the study on LQR raise questions about the broader applicability and versatility of the proposed hierarchical algorithm.\n\n1.1 Can the authors show an example where the motivating examples presented in the introduction, such as neural stimulation and quantum control, are represented by the moment kernel?\n\n1.2 Can the authors provide experimental results on more scenarios?\n\n2. Some related works are worth discussing, like [1].\n\n3. About baselines. Why the authors choose value iteration as the baseline RL algorithm? How value iteration is carried out on a continuous state space? There are more powerful multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms designed for large populations (include but not limited to mean-field methods). Comparing with these algorithms would significantly improve the soundness of the proposed method.\n\n4. (Major) Please help the reviewer understand why a hierarchical framework is necessary. Why can't we start directly from a long, truncated sequence? What are the advantages of beginning with a relatively short sequence?\n\n### Minor problems\n1. Where is the example demonstrating that it is generally impossible to simultaneously minimize the (discounted) future rewards for all the agents by a universal policy?\n\n2. In the paragraph below equation (2), what does the notation $u_{[t,\\infty)]}$ mean?\n\n[1] Zheng, L., Yang, J., Cai, H., Zhou, M., Zhang, W., Wang, J. and Yu, Y., 2018, April.
