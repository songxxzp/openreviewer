Therefore, EWoK reserves the ability to scale to high-dimensional inputs by learning a policy using existing reinforcement learning algorithms. \n\n- The experiment section has enough runs (40 and 10 seeds in different environments) to provide relatively reliable average and confidence intervals.\n\n- The experiment section provides ablation studies for two introduced parameters ($\\kappa$ and $N$)."

As the paper indicates in the conclusion section, EWoK assumes the environment is able to sample from the same state and action pair multiple times. This requirement is easy to achieve when using simulators or when there exists a perfect model, but is unrealistic in real environments. In the real world, it is almost impossible to reset the environment to the previous state and apply the same action multiple times. Given that the paper defines EWoK as an online method for realistic domains, I think this assumption contradicts the scenario which EWoK is supposed to work with. It might be more accurate if the paper reduces the scope to high-dimensional domains.\n\n- At the end of the experiments section, the paper mentions a larger number of next-state samples does not affect the wall clock time a lot. It is nice to notice and discuss the running time of a method, but  I would like to point out that this happens in simulators because simulators react fast. In real-world scenarios, the environment could be much slower for sampling one next state. It would be nice to also check a case in robotics, or some other environments taking relatively long time to respond.\n\n- It might be worth checking a more difficult experiment setting, such as the one single trajectory case. \n\nSome related works:\n\nZhou, Zhengqing, et al. \"Finite-sample regret bound for distributionally robust offline tabular reinforcement learning.\" International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics.
