The main components consist of two part: 1) Image-editing model that generates future subgoals given the current state and task description in language. This model is first pre-trained with Internet-scale data and fine-tuned with in-domain robotic data. This guides low-level policy by specifying near future subgoals. 2) Low-level goal-conditioned policy that accomplishes generated subgoals. The method is evaluated on simulated (CALVIN) and real-world environments, where the proposed method shows better performance in generalization ability that deals with solving novel tasks, objects and environments."

While robotic manipulation datasets have expanded, they can never encompass every potential object or context a robot might encounter. To address this, the paper proposes integrating semantic knowledge into language-guided robotic control by leveraging pre-trained vision and language models.\n\nIn essence, the proposed approach, SuSIE, decomposes the robotic control problem into two phases. In the first phase, an image-editing model is fine-tuned on robot data, allowing it to generate hypothetical future subgoals based on the robot's current observation and a natural language command. These subgoals serve as intermediate objectives that guide the robot towards accomplishing the user-specified task. Importantly, the image-editing model doesn't need to understand how to achieve these subgoals; it only generates them based on semantics. In the second phase, a low-level goal-reaching policy is employed to help the robot reach these hypothetical subgoals. This policy focuses on inferring visuo-motor relationships for correct actuation but doesn't require a deep understanding of semantics. By breaking down the task into smaller, semantically guided subgoals, the overall problem becomes more manageable. SuSIE is compared against a diverse set of approaches, and shown to achieve comparable or sometimes better performance."

In essence, how do you select/optimize for the feasible/relevant subgoals?\n- Table 1 uses some success rates from another paper (Ge et al., 2023). However, the approach proposed in this cited paper achieves higher success rates (see 'Ours' row in Table 2 of Ge et al.) than the ones reported on this paper. Why did you omit this result? Ge et al. seem to also address out-of-distribution generalization. Other than 1-step chain case (theirs 72% vs. SuSIE 75%), the longer chains achieve better results than SuSIE.\n-\tIt was mentioned that Scene C should be a more difficult task than Scene B, however the results in 5.3 show that both MOO, RT-2-X and SuSIE perform significantly better on scene C than on B. Can you explain what the reason might be? Is it related to the VLM or the low-level control policy?\n-\tThe model is illustrated to depict sub-goals nicely as it is able to distinguish between particular objects to orient the gripper towards. But there are non-visual properties of these objects that low-level controllers need to consider to perform pick and place tasks, such as weight and friction. This model however seems to rely on visual properties only. Would the robot in this pipeline be able to pick up such challenging objects, such as a heavy and slippery object, even after a few tries?\n-\tInstructPix2Pix is not capable of performing viewpoint changes, how would this challenge be reflected in a real-life or research scenario where there are often multiple or moving cameras present?\n-\tOften, the gripper may be obscured in the camera view due to other objects, such as the rest of the robot. The first phase may output these subgoals as a suggestion of pre-grasp or grasp pose. However, due to decoupling, the low-level controller would have no way of knowing this is the case. In the image of the scene, any pose of the gripper would look the same. How would the scene play out, would the robot be able to recover or get stuck?\n-\tCan you elaborate on the role/effect of the conditional policy (Section 4.2)? It seems to enforce the robot to follow the trajectory sampled in the dataset when it encounters a similar state and subgoal. What happens when it encounters, say, a similar current state but a different subgoal (that was not in the dataset) during test time?\n-\tDoes your robot dataset consist of only completely successful trajectories? If not, could a subgoal be generated for failure (e.g., robot holds the desired object in the current state, but subgoal generates a state where it is dropped? If so, how do you handle such cases?\n-\tThere is a minor error in the table references. In Section 5.3 and A2.2.2, you mentioned \"Table 5.3,\" which refers to \"Table 1.\""

The tasks are defined by a starting and end states, provided as visual observations. The goal is then to control a robotic arm to reach the goal state from the start state.\n\nAuthors propose to leverage large pre-trained language-guided image editing diffusion models to hallucinate the next subgoal or waypoint to reach to complete a given task. The diffusion model is thus used as a high-level planner whose goal is to output a close next sub-goal to find. A low-level policy is also trained to reach a sub-goal given its current state.\n\nThe diffusion model is fine-tuned on robotic data to learn to predict a waypoint given a language intersection, while the low-level policy is trained with behavior cloning on a dataset of trajectories.\n\nThe main claim of the paper is that the knowledge coming from Internet-scale pre-training of diffusion models allows a broader generalization to new scenarios and that such models are able to provide physically realistic new sub-goals. As all high-level planning is done by the generative model, the policy only has to perform low-level short-term control to reach a close waypoint, leading to more precise manipulation.\n\nExperiments are conducted both in simulation and on a real-world robotic platform, and the introduced method is compared against diverse relevant baselines."

They claim that the predicted sub-goal images are physically plausible and of higher quality when leveraging the *InstructPix2Pix* pre-training. I find it hard to assess the quality of the generated images only from looking at these examples. This leads to 2 concerns:\n    * **W1.1**: Is the pre-training improving the downstream policy performance? The paper only presents a qualitative comparison of predicted sub-goals. Authors should report quantitative results, controlling the low-level policy to reach subgoals generated by the 2 models (with and without InstructPix2Pix pre-training) to show that the Internet-scale pre-training brings a boost in performance.\n    * **W1.2**: Are the predicted subgoals really physically plausible, and is it a pre-requisite for the low-level policy to succeed in controlling the robotic arm? By looking at Figure 3, it is not easy to verify that sub-goals are physically plausible. Further experiments should be conducted to verify this quantitatively. Moreover, authors should conduct experiments to show that having physically plausible sub-goals improves the performance of the low-level policy. A possible scenario might be that sub-goals are not always physically plausible, but through its training, the low-level policy has learned to come as close as possible to sub-goals while avoiding ending up in any undesirable state.\n\n* **W2**: **[Major]** How are findings from Figure 4 generalizable? It shows qualitative rollouts from the proposed method and RT-2-X which seem to indicate that RT-2-X manipulates objects with less precision. However, quantitative results in Table 2 show that RT-2-X outperforms the introduced method in certain tasks, showing it might be more precise in some cases.\n\n* **W3**: **[Major]** RT-2-X outperforms the method on certain tasks. However, as mentioned by the authors, RT-2-X was trained on a large robotics dataset and the proposed method still showcases promising performance on most tasks. I thus believe this smaller performance compared with RT-2-X on scene C does not outweigh the interesting contributions of this work.\n\n* **W4**: **[Minor]** To the best of my knowledge, the policy action space is not described in the main paper.

                "value": "SuSIE uses a pre-trained image editing diffusion model as a high-level planner, along with a low-level goal-conditioned policy trained to achieve these subgoals.\nThe approach successfully solves real robot control tasks that involve new objects, distractions, and environments.\nThe method is compared to existing approaches in terms of incorporating semantic information from pre-trained models.\nThe paper is well-written and easy-to-read."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The diffusion model and low-level policy are trained separately, meaning the diffusion model is unaware of the low-level policy's capabilities.\nThere is no discussion on how to handle the situation if the generated subgoal is incorrect, nor are there any mechanisms for error detection and recover.\nMost of the tasks presented in the paper appear to be easily solvable using pre-trained perception modules and traditional planning methods.\nThe core of the method InstructPix2Pix can only infer from visual information and cannot infer any physical properties of the scene that certain tasks require.\nReal-world evaluation is conducted in just three scenes, which may not fully capture the complexity and variability of actual manipulation tasks."

                "value": "1. In Algorithm 1\nI was wondering how to determine the key frames that cannot be described in a single instruction. You mentioned sampling a new subgoal every K steps. How do you choose the goal sampling interval K to ensure the subgoals are plausible enough?  \n2. In 5.2 you mention \"an understanding of dynamics to predict how to move and rotate the gripper to grasp it.\"\nHow can you determine the plausibility of the prediction in terms of dynamics, given that the generating subgoals and learning low-level control policies are separate?  \n3. It seems that an extremely accurate pose of the end effectors is needed. I am somewhat concerned that the precision of the genarated subgoal frame may not be sufficient to achieve it."
