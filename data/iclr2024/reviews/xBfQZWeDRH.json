The main novelty lies in GeoDiffusion is that it encodes not only the bounding boxes but also extra geometric conditions such as camera views in selfdriving scenes.\nTo embed the bounding box locations, it discretizes the continuous coordinates by dividing the image into a grid of location bins, creates unique location tokens, and inserts the  to the text encoder vocabulary. To embed other conditions along with bounding boxes, it uses a prompt template \u201cAn image of {view} camera with {boxes}\u201d. To enforce the model focus on foreground and balance the bounding boxes of different sizes during training, it proposes an area re-weighting method to dynamically assign higher weights to smaller boxes.\nIt is claimed that GeoDiffusion outperforms previous L2I methods while maintaining faster training time."

The claimed improvement in the introduction (+21.85 FID and +27.1 mAP) is questionable and misleading as they are obtained by comparing with old GAN-based methods.\n2. Related to 1), Stable Diffusion is not a good option for comparison of layout-based inpainting in Figure 5 as Stable Diffusion does not consume bounding box explicitly. I suggest to replace it with ControlNet and GLIGEN for a fair comparison.\n3. Related to 1), the importance of camera views is not clearly due to the missing baselines. Furthermore, there are no qualitative illustration of the effect of camera views except a single example in Figure 1."

Given the fact that recent diffusion-based methods such as ControlNet, ReCo, and GLIGEN can also do Layout-to-Image tasks, the authors should include them in Table 2 (Comparison of generation fidelity on NuImages) and Table 3 (Comparison of generation trainability on NuImages). Current comparisons in Tables 2 and 3 are not up-to-date.\n2. The proposed camera-dependent conditioning prompt is very similar to the view-dependent prompting in DreamFusion. The authors need to ablate more on why their method is novel compared to the one proposed in DreamFusion.\n3. The idea of using synthetic images generated from the model to augment training object detectors is reasonable. However, the authors need to ablate how much data is needed to train GeoDiffusion (in the Trainability section), since if the number of real data (and box annotations) required to train GeoDiffusion is significantly larger than the numbers needed to train an object detector, the application of this paper is not realistic.\n4.  The method is sensitive to the image size and aspect ratio of each dataset. In other words, the number of bins is different across datasets, therefore, greatly affecting the transferability of the proposed approach when trained on a dataset and tested on another dataset. In contrast, other baselines such as Copy and Paste Synthesis can use Stable Diffusion to generate the object of interest better in this situation.\n5. Lack of experiments of long-tail (rare) object detection datasets such as LVIS and domain adaptation such as GTAV to Cityscapes or Cityscapes to Foggy Cityscapes. In these settings, the importance of synthetic data is more significant than in the domain where real images and box annotations are largely available. \n6. Among these two contributions, which one is more important?\n7. It would be better to move the ablation study from supp (table 9, 10) to the main paper."

Another interesting question is can the model generate more samples of rare classes on a long-tailed dataset (LVIS).\n3. In Table 2 (Comparison of generation fidelity on NuImages), there is a version of GeoDiffusion with an input resolution of 800x456, how is this obtainable while Stable Diffusion input is 512x512?\n4. How do the location bins resolutions affect generation in testing? For instance, if the location bins are trained at 256x256, can the model generate a prompt with a 512x512 grid in test time?"
