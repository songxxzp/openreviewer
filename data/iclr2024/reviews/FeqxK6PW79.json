The authors show that the studied architectures share similar ID and MAPC profiles for a few different datasets. Additionally, the authors showed that the final ID is positively correlated with performance; and presented how the geometry profiles change along with the training process."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Major weakness:\n- **Lack of insights to timeseries.** The presented work, although bridges the gap of using manifold learning analysis to study TSF models, lacks insights to timeseries datasets. Specifically, timeseries datasets have their unique properties and challenges, e.g. sampling rate of the timeseries; tokenization layer (specifically, if the token is the aggregation of timeseries across different channels, as the channel-independence property studied in [1, 2, 3]; what is the proper length of the token as mentioned in [1]). The studied group of model architecture, which is transformer, is also not representative enough for timeseries applications, as many linear models [4] and previously, CNN-based models [5] has good performance on the studied task. Overall, this has limited the contribution of the proposed work.\n- **Lack of studied architectures.** The selected architectures Autoformer and Fedformer are out-of-dated and contain specific components. E.g. Fedformer uses frequency-analysis to decompose the frequency information (or seasonal trends) in timeseries. The Informer mentioned in appendix helps with this lack of architectures, yet I am not sure about the `Transformer\u2019 mentioned in appendix. What are the specs of this transformer architecture? One important aspect of timeseries study is the spatiotemporal relationship in sequences (that are fed into the transformer); as well as the input dimension of the tokenization layer. How are those selected and how the analyzed properties differ across such choices?\n- **Over-claimed contributions.** In conclusion section: \u201cOur results indicate a fundamental difference between classification and regression models: while the former networks shrink the ID significantly to extract a meaningful representation that is amenable for linear separation, regression models behave differently\u201d this contribution seems overclaimed. It is unclear if the behaviour (ID's correlation w performance) is unique to timeseries forecasting or if it is general to all regression/generative tasks. It is also unclear if the reason of such behaviour is due to that the task is a regression task (specifically, it is possible that all timeseries tasks e.g. classification also gives such behaviour). A related question would be that: Does that mean e.g. a generative model in vision also gives better performance when the ID is higher? This contribution should not be claimed if the authors do not fundamentally reveal/prove this correlation.\n\n[1] Nie, Yuqi, Nam H.

The main observations are: 1) the dimensionality and curvature of the representation manifold either drop or stay fixed in the encoder layers, but then increase significantly in the decoder layers. This phenomenon is consistent across different models, datasets, and forecast horizons; 2) The intrinsic dimension in the final layer is correlated with the model performance; 3) Compared to the untrained models, the ID and MAPC of the representation manifolds change significantly during training, but converge quickly."

They are not even based on the standard auto-regressive decoder. Given the complexity of these models, it is hard to tell whether the observations are specific to these models due to their design choices or generalizable to other deep transformer models. I am not convinced that the observations are generalizable because of the high complexity of the chosen models.\n\n- Given the high dimensionality of the latent representations, I am not sure whether the estimated intrinsic dimension and curvature information are reliable. The authors should provide some justification for the reliability of the estimates. For example, why is the estimated intrinsic dimension of the first layer close to 1 for Autoformer in Figure 3?
