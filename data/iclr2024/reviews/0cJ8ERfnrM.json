As this work is proposing a benchmark on an important problem which may greatly affect the direction of the community, it is necessary to prove the fidelity of the synthetic labels. More analysis should be incorporated to prove that the computed labels are well aligned with wet-lab validations. For example, the authors can validate the accuracy of the synthetic labels on a dataset with known binding affinity and with a similar distribution to the generated sequences used in the benchmark. However, the best and most direct way might still be sampling a small subset in the benchmark and validate them with wet-lab experiments.\n2. Adequate interpretation on the experimental results with respect to the proposed hypothesis is missing. In section 3.1, the authors propose the hypothesis that the causal features might be physico-chemical and geometric properties at the binding interface. However, no further analysis or interpretations on whether the tested DG algorithms have learnt this invariance are provided. Also, in Table 2 and Table 3, vanilla ERM beats most DG methods. Does this mean most of the DG methods can not learn the hypothesized invariance at all?"

To this end, the paper compiles a sequence of synthetic datasets where the antigen targets and the antibody candidates are shifted and the binary label of binding affinity is computed using a physics-based computational method.

There is no validation of the quality of these labels either experimentally or against other computational methods. Given this, it's unclear whether or not good performance on this dataset is actually meaningful.\n\n2. The composition of the benchmark dataset seems to be somewhat arbitrary. The different environments have seemingly randomly chosen compositions of antigens and generative model parameters. There is no justification behind the choice of generative model parameters beyond the statement that changing this parameter varies the similarity between samples and starting seeds.\n\n3.

The applicability goes potentially beyond the application presented here.\n\n2) The methods presented to improve DG are not rocket science which does caveat the level of contribution here but also means that implementing the solutions presented by the authors is trivial and therefore industrial applications flow directly from the paper.

Some eminent professors in the field of AI have pointed out the somewhat misguiding nature of the term. In a scientific paper, it might be warranted to explain what exactly the authors mean by this term. Do we just mean here a model with good generalization, fine-tuning and zero-shot abilities? Can we give more details as to why the architecture considered here and the data set the model was trained on are a good fit. This is not self-evident IMO.\n\n2) The authors only consider one baseline to compare ESM2 against without really motivating its design. I hate to be the reviewer asking for more baselines but, as such, the conclusion that using foundational models improves solving DG is tenuous based on the evidence given in the paper. More comparisons are needed I believe. At the very least, the level of confidence of the conclusion should be lowered and doubt made explicit.\n\n3) The other conclusions, namely that resembling helps baseline models and that choosing a good validation set is important are really not surprising and do not constitute a substantial contribution. \n\n4) I think that Figure 6 needs to be a bit more explained in appendix to novices in the field of protein design.

While one can expect such a result, since we are entirely relying on experimental comparisons with baselines here, it is very hard to give credence to the claim with just a baseline which looks a bit arbitrarily chosen (I do agree that the design makes intuitive sense but there are other families of models that readers may want to see considered here such as simple RNN, attention models, and combinations of these approaches with CNNs)."

The dataset is fully synthetic, which the authors explain as necessary due to the high cost of antibody tests in a laboratory setting (and, I imagine, their inability to disclose actual laboratory datasets from ongoing or past projects due to competitive risks).  Although one would hope that the particular distribution shift captures an important mode of the distribution shifts observed during laboratory antibody design, it is not clear if the selection process used here ends up being educational for applications in real world settings.  Perhaps the authors have anecdotal or unpublished evidence supporting such a claim, however, this conclusion is not clear from the writing itself. It does not help that the presented characterization has jargon specialized to the field and terms like MMD (maximal mean discrepancy?) and saliency visualization that are not clarified and have scales that are illegible in the axis labels of Fig 4 and 6.\n\nAlthough I don't mind people selling their own work as well as they can, I do take issue with one particular statement in page 5 that reads: \"Being much larger than small molecules, they are arguably more complex and more challenging to characterize.\"  This statement is misleading.  Empirically, antibody design in drug discovery settings is dramatically easier than small molecule design as evidenced by the shorter average timescale of the research pipelines prior to reaching development candidates, despite the potentially much more convenient modality of a small molecule therapy if it was comparably complex to design.  The pipelines for dealing with antibodies are well established and antibody production is almost like a printing press compared to those of small molecules, for which some particular designs might take months to years to get right. I agree, however, with the sentiment of the paragraph, namely proteins present unique design challenges and it is thus useful to have an additional benchmark."

The specific construction of the inputs to the different environments basically differ in the seed sequences used in the sampling to generate new sequences that would progress to the next level.  Could it be that the authors always create a perfect setting for ensemble models and simple moving averages?  If showing this conclusion was the main purpose of the paper, are there simpler or additional datasets that could support it?\n\nThe particular 8M-parameter ESM2 model that the authors used sounds incredibly small.  It is not clear if that is a necessity (and if so, why), or if it turns out to somehow be sufficient and as good as the next level ESM2 model.\n\nThe authors (I believe) presented a closely related work at an ICML symposium this summer.
