The Kalman Temporal Difference (KTD) framework in RL treats the value function as a random variable, aiming to track the policy learning process by formulating RL as a state space model. However, KTD-based techniques employing linearization methods become inefficient with high-dimensional models.\n\nTo improve the computational efficiency in deep RL, this paper reformulates RL with a new state space model, and adopts Langevinized ensemble Kalman filter (LEnKF) algorithm to ensure that the empirical distribution of the parameters in value function will converge to the desired target distribution. This reformulation enhances robustness by including prior information in the state evolution equation, robustifying performance, and handling large-scale neural network approximations. The proposed algorithm introduces computational efficiency, directly handling nonlinear functions without requiring linearization. It achieves memory efficiency by replacing the storage for the covariance matrix with particles, showcasing scalability for large-scale neural network approximations.\n\nProviding the convergence guarantee in deep RL while incorporating approximate Bayesian inference can be challenging. This paper establishes promising performance guarantees in this regime."

Although the above methods do not adopt MCMC methods as approximate sampling scheme, could authors compare the proposed method with the existing Bayesian RL methods, not just restricted to the Kalman TD context?\n\n2. Though the authors provide a clear comparison to the existing Kalman TD frameworks,  it is desirable to see a more thorough related work study in Bayesian RL / uncertainty quantification in deep RL, which would be beneficial.\n\n3. The proposed method requires a proper prior distribution to achieve the performance guarantee in LEnKF. It is unclear how the quality of the prior affects the performance through the current theorems. Is it possible to capture such quantity in the upper bounds provided in Theorem 1 or Theorem 2?\n\n4. The experiment environments are relatively simple, especially for the control tasks. It is suggested authors consider more complicated locomotion tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n5. The proofs of Theorem 1 and 2 rely on a significant number of assumptions. It is suggested authors comment on whether those assumptions are imposed in order to achieve the convergence guarantee in sampling schemes, and how such assumptions can be satisfied in practice."
