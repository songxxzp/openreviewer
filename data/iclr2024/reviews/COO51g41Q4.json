Simply composing two existing metrics, as the core novelty of the paper, does not deserve a good contribution, in my opinion.\n  - The proposed STAR is not the first work to capture the cross-layer importance and enables different compression ratios among different layers. For example, DiffRate[3] can also automatically learn different compression rates across layers. The lack of thorough comparisons with these previous approaches also harms the contribution and novelty of this paper.\n- Method\n  - The proposed STAR introduces an extra procedure for pre-computing average cosine similarity as a metric, while other token compression method does not. It is unclear how much extra time this procedure will cost and how the size of the dataset used for pre-computing will affect the model performance.\n- Experiments\n  - Some important baselines are missing. For example, DiffRate[3] mentioned above.\n  - The setting of comparison experiments is unfair. STAR uses an extra distillation to enhance the after-pruning performance, while some compared methods, such as ToMe[4], do not use it. Experimental results without distillation should also be reported to achieve a fair comparison.\n  - Some ablation studies are missing. For example, the impact of the dataset size used for pre-computing metrics on model performance. Besides, it would be better if there were zero-shot experiments to investigate how well these pre-computed metrics perform on out-of-distribution datasets (e.g., ImageNet-R[5]).\n  - Experimental results at different compression ratios on the same model are missing. For each model, there is only one compression ratio used, and different compression ratios on the same model are needed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed STAR under higher and lower compression ratios.\n  - Experiments on different architectures are insufficient. The experiments are only conducted on DeiT and LV-ViT, and it would be better to also have experimental results on other branches of the ViT family, for example, Swin Transformer[6] and CSWin Transformer[7], which adopt window attentions.\n\nReferences  \n[1] EViT: Expediting Vision Transformers Via Token Reorganizations.  \n[2] Transformer interpretability beyond attention visualization.  \n[3] DiffRate: Differentiable Compression Rate for Efficient Vision Transformers.  \n[4] Token merging: Your vit but faster.  \n[5] The many faces of robustness: A critical analysis of out-of-distribution generalization.  \n[6] Swin transformer: Hierarchical vision transformer using shifted windows.  \n[7] CSWin Transformer: A General Vision Transformer Backbone With Cross-Shaped Windows."
