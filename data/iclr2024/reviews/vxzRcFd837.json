The authors try to justify this point by some empirical studies, which I think is not convincing. It would be better if the authors can reveal the intrinsic reason from the aspect of complementary label generation which is related to groundtruth label, namely starting from p(\\bar{Y}=\\bar{y}|Y=y, X=x). For example, the authors found that the sparser complementary label distribution will appear under IDCLL. But why? Maybe it is related to the label generation probability. In other words, I think the authors should make more insightful investigations on this setting.\n2.\tAlthough the proposed loss function is new for CLL, it is actually a very straightforward adaptation from (Ishida et al., 2017). Considering that there have been intensive researches on instance-dependent settings in other problems (e.g., label noise, semi-supervised learning, PU learning, etc.), and similar loss has been developed. I think the proposed loss in this paper is not that interesting nor sufficiently novel.  \n3.\tThe writing of this paper needs improvement. For example, in abstract, I cannot fully understand \u201ccapacity to share complementary labels\u201d. Why sharing complementary labels? Who will share these labels? with whom?\n4.\tThe experiments are only conducted on some synthetic datasets. It would be better if the authors can find some benchmark datasets that naturally follow the setting of IDCLL."
