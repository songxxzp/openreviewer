Through comprehensive experiments on ten real-world graph datasets, the authors provide insights into the benefits and drawbacks of using GNNs and propose a guide for practitioners in choosing appropriate graph representation learning models under different scenarios. The paper aims to provide a broader perspective on graph learning and to recalibrate the academic perspective on the effectiveness of GNNs compared to conventional shallow embedding methods."

Classic methods have similar embeddings for nodes located close to each other in the graph. Under the homophily assumption, such nodes often have the same label.\n\nQ3. The fact that GNNs strongly rely on node features and removing them leads to decreased performance is very natural. Can this problem be solved by augmenting node features with structural graph-based features? Or maybe even with random features? Both options can also increase the representation effective dimension.\n\nQ4. Can small representation effective dimension be explained just by the dimension of the initial feature set? This would also explain Figure 5(b) since increased rank bound cannot solve this issue.\n\nQ5. The concatenation experiment is conducted only on one dataset (DBLPFull). Are the results on other datasets consistent with this?\n\nQ6.
