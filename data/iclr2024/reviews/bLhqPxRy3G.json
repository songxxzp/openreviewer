There needs more discussion on the upper bound $\\bar{\\eta}$ on the step size, and the linear rate $\\rho$ in Theorem 3.4, specifically their dependence on 1) the underlying LP problem $(A,b,c)$, and its scale (# of decision variables, #of constraints, etc.); 2) the initialization $u_0$. For example, if either $A$ is ill-conditioned, or the initialization is close to the origin, then I believe $\\rho$ should be close to one. Merely showing that GD converges linearly does not make a significant contribution if what authors propose is to implement this GD algorithm for solving real LP problems. \n2. Theorem 3.5 only shows that the GD converges to some $x^\\infty$ that is close to the desired solution to the LP, but the result is weak in the sense that it doesn't suggest an upper bound on the # of GD iterations for achieving certain accuracy. Specifically, the convergence result one expects is that given some $\\epsilon>0$, the GD with some step size $\\eta(\\epsilon)$ takes $T(\\epsilon)$ iterations to achieve either 1) $\\|x^T-x^*\\|\\leq \\epsilon$, where $x^*$ is the true optimal solution; 2) or the optimality gap is less than $\\epsilon$. \n3. Another concern I have is that I don't find, from the discussions and experiments in this paper, any evidence that the proposed algorithm has advantages in solving certain LPs, compared to existing methods."
