                "value": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a widely used technique in recommender systems, and some researchers have tried to improve it using message passing in graph neural networks. However, the reasons for the improvement remain unclear. This study investigates the effects of message passing on CF from various perspectives and finds that it primarily improves CF performance through information passed from neighbors and typically benefits low-degree nodes more than high-degree ones. Based on these findings, the authors propose a test-time augmentation framework called TAG-CF, which performs message passing only once at inference time and can be used as a plug-and-play module. Tested on five datasets, TAG-CF achieves similar or better results than existing graph-based CF methods with significantly less training time. The study also shows that test-time aggregation in TAG-CF improves recommendation performance similarly to training-time aggregation, validating the findings on why message passing improves CF."

However, it does not mean that low-degree users will benefit more from message passing. Actually it the same conclusion for low-degree users. The difference of experimental evidences may be due to underfitting of low-degree users.\n3.

The experimental results of the proposed framework are not significant and the scope of application is narrow. (1) Although the proposed TAG-CF can improve the CF methods by using messaging in the test phase, it does not work well compared to GNN-based models, such as the mentioned SGL and LightGCL. (2) And from the design philosophy of using message passing only for testing, this framework can only be used on non-GNN-based models. However, as there are many works that modify the message passing for CF with great performance rather than being limited to LightGCN, it is difficult to bridge the gap in the benefits of training with it. (3) In terms of time efficiency, there is no significant advantage over the relatively light GNN-based models recently. You can find some more recent models to compare the efficiency to show the benefits in this regard.\n\n3. The arrangement of Table 2 is not very reasonable.

                "value": "Weaknesses:\n\n1. The conclusions drawn from the experiments on LightGCN are well-known and lack a deeper theoretical foundation.\n\nIn Section 3.1 of the paper, the conclusions drawn are not groundbreaking; instead, they represent widely accepted knowledge, lacking innovation. Moreover, the article fails to provide theoretical underpinnings for the hypotheses and conclusions presented, making it challenging to extend these findings to collaborative filtering algorithms beyond LightGCN. The research solely relies on the LightGCN model in experiments conducted on three datasets with relatively high sparsity, which may introduce bias. The experimental results indicate two key points: 1. Message passing and gradient updates have practical significance for collaborative filtering recommendation systems, and 2. Message passing primarily contributes to performance improvements in collaborative filtering. It's worth noting that since the article exclusively investigates the LightGCN model, the conclusion predominantly emphasizes the role of message passing in enhancing LightGCN's performance. While this conclusion holds for LightGCN, it may not necessarily apply to other models, warranting further exploration.\n\nIndeed, further theoretical exploration may be necessary.\n\n2. The setup of the exploratory experiments is problematic, and this experimental design lacks fairness and equity.\n\nFurthermore, in the exploratory experiments of Section 3.1, the experimental design lacks the necessary rigor to effectively validate the author's hypotheses. In the case of (LightGCNw/o neigh. info), a message passing mechanism is employed during training but not during inference. During training, embedding representations are improved through message passing to obtain new user and item embeddings, which are then used to compute BPR loss. The optimization objective of message passing is to enhance the similarity and dissimilarity between embedding features after message passing. However, in the inference phase, the experiments omit message passing and use the original features as embeddings for users and items. This results in inconsistent optimization objectives between training and inference, with inference embeddings notably lacking in similarity and collaborative signals. Consequently, the (LightGCNw/o neigh. info) model's performance unavoidably becomes suboptimal. These experimental results, therefore, cannot effectively prove that message passing is the most critical factor.\n\n3. Applying TAG-CF solely to MF and ENMF is insufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG-CF, and in some experiments, the results show non-statistically significant improvements.\n\nThe proposed TAG-CF essentially involves deactivating message passing during model training and enabling it during inference. In the primary experiment, only ENMF and MF had an additional message passing step during inference to validate its effectiveness. However, these experiments are considered insufficiently comprehensive. It might be necessary to apply TAG-CF to a broader range of classic Graph-based recommendation models to thoroughly confirm its effectiveness. Limiting the application to the simplest ENMF and MF models alone may not be sufficient to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG-CF. The comparative models solely comprise classic NGCF and LightGCN; thus, it might be necessary to include more recent models in the experiments. Additionally, on some datasets, the improvement is less than 2%, which is not statistically significant.\n\n4. The choice of datasets in this study is limited to a single type.\n\nAdditionally, the choice of datasets in this study is confined to a single type. The paper's model primarily focuses on node degrees, but the datasets used in the experiments all have relatively high sparsity. It would be beneficial to include datasets with lower sparsity, such as Movielens-1M, to ensure a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.\n\n5. Despite the computational complexity, the improvements achieved with TAG-CF+ are not significantly greater than those of TAG-CF.\n\nTAG-CF+ involves exclusively passing messages to nodes with lower degrees. However, the computation of node degrees, selection of low-degree nodes, and the search for neighbors of low-degree nodes represent computationally complex tasks."

The analysis is initially driven by the assumption that, even though message passing in graph collaborative filtering is applied exactly as it appears in other graph learning tasks, evidence (in terms of recommendation performance) demonstrates that message passing in graph collaborative filtering may be working in a different manner. On one side, through a simple reformulation of the message passing (in the case of LightGCN) the authors show that it inherently comes with the usual user-item similarity score (as in MF) plus additional inductive biases accounting for other more refined interactions between users and/or items. This suggests that the message passing could improve MF-like approaches in two ways, namely: 1) neighborhood aggregation and 2) the additional gradient updates. An empirical analysis demonstrates that it is the neighborhood aggregation to provide the highest contribution to the improved performance. On another side, the authors empirically and mathematically prove that, differently from what happens in graph learning, high degree nodes seem to benefit from message passing more than low degree ones. In the light of above, the authors propose TAG-CF, short for Test-time Aggregation for Collaborative Filtering, a simple but effective model agnostic solution which performs message passing on top of any MF-like recommender system only at inference time. Extensive experimental analyses confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach over several baselines and on popular recommendation datasets. The evaluation is complemented through ablation studies and a computational time assessment."
