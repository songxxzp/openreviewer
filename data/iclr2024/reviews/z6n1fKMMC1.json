                "value": "In this paper, the authors give the first computationally efficient tester-learner for learning halfspaces where the target distribution is the d-variate Gaussian and the label noise is Massart or adversarial. The tester-learner framework was recently proposed as a generation to the distribution-specific learning setting where the algorithm needs to accept a dataset whenever it comes from a target distribution and needs to achieve the agnostic learning guarantee (error = $opt + \\varepsilon$) whenever it accepts. Previous work only gave a sample-optimal tester learner for the same problem which was not computationally efficient. The main technical novelty in this work is tester that looks at the labels as opposed to the label-oblivious testers previously designed. For the adversarial noise setting, the authors achieve the suboptimal risk $O(opt) + \\varepsilon$.\n\nThe authors build on the non-convex optimization approach of [DKTZ] which uses the a smoothed version of the ramp loss as a surrogate to the zero one loss. Although this is a non-convex function, it was shown that the stationary points are good solution which can be recovered by projected SGD as the first step under the Gaussianity assumption. In the testing-learning framework, we need to additionally check the following assumption: the probability masses of certain regions are proportional to their geometric measures. The tester checks local properties of the distribution in regions described by the stationary points using moment matching techniques. Naively, such a check could only guarantee the empirical mass is additively close to the true mass. However, using a refined moment test conditioned on a band based on the stationary vector (similar to the existing localization-based refinement techniques of Awasti et al. 2017) they could get the stronger multiplicative guarantee. This allows them to argue that if the test passes, the stationary points will indeed be close to the true weight vector in angular distance. This in turn means the returned vectors are good solutions using properties of Gaussian. The later step results in a larger error for the adversarial noise setting as opposed to the Massart noise setting."
