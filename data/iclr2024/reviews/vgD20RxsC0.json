There are no clear definitions of the mathematical notations, which makes it impossible to follow the meaning of the mathematical models. On a probably minor point, formulas are poorly presented in a chaotic way. For example, a formula should be interpreted as a part of the sentence, which means that there should be a comma or period after it if the sentence is to be finished.\n\n3. The experimental results seem to be unreliable. The authors only select a few benchmark algorithms without explaining the reasons and without proper citations and conduct them on merely two datasets (no clear sources or citations again). As I understand, the second dataset is constructed by the authors based on the first one, implying that there may be only ONE underlying dataset for evaluation. There are even missing parts in the experiment results in the appendix. The paper should be taken more seriously to meet the caliber of a top conference."
