An extrapolation network to predict the embedding of a time period based on optimal embedding from previous time periods. Then, the embedding is adjusted individually for each sample before using a decoder to generate the model parameters. The authors tested their methods on 6 datasets and compared them to several relevant continue learning baselines. An ablation study was done to show their impact on the performances. The authors also open sourced 3 datasets.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not familiar with the continuing learning for forecasting literatures, and I would need to count on others to comment on the related works.\n\n==== After reading the authors revision and response ===\nI raised my score to 5 but I don't think the paper is good enough to be accepted at ICLR."

Without it, the proposed method (which is quite complex) will not champion the others. This is not too surprising as the model is adjusted per-sample. But it comes with more computational cost and there is no address on this aspect in the paper.\n\nFollowing from the above, the paper used many ideas and I think many of them, if studied thoroughly, can be a paper itself. For example, how effective learning is in the embedding space than in the original parameter space? How well one could predict parameters of the model in the new period, compared to parameters trained in the new period? What is the impact of just having per-sample adjusted parameters? How efficient is the adjustment? Is it generally applicable for other models? I would think the paper needs simplification, rather than complication."

This can be very in-efficient. \n\nWhat is STOPGRAD in eq(7)? Does H_P in eq(7) mean the prediction after adjustment or the base embedding?\n\nIn Figure 3(b), I thought the L_{surrogate} is used to find the sample specific embedding, which is the adjustment. But then why before L_{surrogate}, there is a red-block of adjustment?\n\nWhy not take the model trained in the previous period as a baseline? This should be a good sanity check for all continue learning methods."

Particularly, the authors utilize embedding learned from LSTMs over a time window that are adjusted with a sample-specific surrogate loss to account for micro-drifts. The two functions are jointly learned from data, and embedding are updated over time. The empirical results comparing the proposed LEAF approach to other competing methods over well known datasets and the newly introduced electric load datasets shows that the proposed approach generally performs well, resulting in lower error. Furthermore, the ablation study conducted by the authors demonstrate the rationale behind the two stage optimization procedure proposed in the paper."

IEEE, 2016. and Wang, Zhuoyi, et al. \"Metric learning based framework for streaming classification with concept evolution.\" 2019 international joint conference on neural networks (IJCNN). IEEE, 2019.\n2. While the paper conceptually explains the optimization function employed, it is not clear how the actual network architecture is constructed. The authors mention in the implementation details that MLPs were used for implementing decoder. However, lack of additional information significantly reduces the ability to reproduce provided results in the paper.\n3. One of the key elements of a data classification/time series prediction mechanism over a data stream is space and time complexity. This is completely missing in the paper. While the authors claim that LEAF's performance improvements over competing methods are significantly better, it is not clear if this is due to higher cost in computation and/or time. It would be better for the authors to provide a computational complexity analysis and comparison."

They should also experiment on this model to demonstrate the effectiveness of LEAF, in addition to the vanilla TCN.\n\nBesides, Non-stationary Transformer also claims that it can handle the non-stationary time series, which should also be included in discussion and comparison.\n\n[1] TimesNet: Temporal 2D-Variation Modeling for General Time Series Analysis, ICLR 2023\n\n[2] Non-stationary Transformers: Rethinking the Stationarity in Time Series Forecasting, NeurIPS 2023\n\nOne simple baseline for online learning is to retrain the model with new-coming data. How about this protocol? For example, suppose that the first training adopts 70% data, you can also train a new model when you receive 90% new data.\n\n3.\tThe Na\u00efve setting could be wrong. \n\nWhy not train the model with both warm-up and meta-train data? Since LEAF also adopts the meta-train data for model training, a fair comparison is to adopt the same training data for all baselines. Correct me if I misunderstood.\n\n4.\tAbout the \"model agnostic\" claim.\n\nIt is interesting to generate forecasting model parameters. I suggest listing the generated parameter size for each model, since the transformer-based models are quite big. How to directly decode such big model parameter with MLPs? Or you just change part of the model. This point should be made clearer. If you only adjust the final linear layer, it is hard to claim model agnostic, giving that there are a lot of models do not contain the final linear layer."

The authors propose a unified meta-learning framework called LEAF (Learning to Extrapolate and Adjust for Forecasting) which divides the concept drift into macro-drift corresponding to stable and long-term changes and micro-drift referring to sudden or short-term changes. An extrapolation module is first meta-learnt to track the dynamics of the prediction model in latent space and extrapolate to the future considering macro-drift. Then an adjustment module incorporates meta-learnable surrogate loss to capture sample-specific micro-drift\npatterns. Extensive experiments are conducted."

                "value": "The paper proposes a two-stage meta-learning framework to address the concept drift issue for time-series forecasting. The authors identify and address the two types of drift namely macro-drift and micro-drift. Drifts in time series that occur over a longer time period are referred to as macro-drifts whereas drifts that occur (and perhaps disappear) within short windows of time are referred to as micro-drifts. Macro-drifts are modeled using an LSTM network that learns the evolution of an embedding space corresponding to macro-drift parameters. The LSTM returns a macro-drift-adjusted embedding which is then used further. Micro-drifts are addressed using meta-learning framework that evaluates the difference between current training data (which is supposed to have micro-drifts) and historical training data using a relation network and returns micro-drift adjusted model parameters.\n\nThe entire framework can learn in an online manner, meaning the model parameters are updated as more data is made available. Initial parameters are learned in an offline phase (warmup) which are then used as initial parameters for online learning phase.\n\nAuthors show comparison of their framework across various time series forecasting architectures (such as PatchTST) and other frameworks that address the concept drift in time series on benchmark datasets."

(significance) The proposed framework is more suitable for online-learnning which is a more practical setup and more accurately depicts the real-world scenario in which ML models are deployed.\n2.

                "value": "1. Authors employ an LSTM network to model the evolution of latent space for addressing the macro-drift. However, using an LSTM to model the evolution of latent space has been significantly explored in the past. I suggest authors to refer to the paper (and its citations): Deep State Space Models for Time Series Forecasting\n\nThe empirical success of LSTM-based evolution is well-known, hence I believe that the solution to the macro-drift issue is short of novelty. The proposed solution can act as a strong baseline for a more novel solution. I suggest authors explore more aggressive approaches for extrapolation than only using a vanilla LSTM for predicting the evolution of parameters.\n\n2. More details on the solution proposed for modeling micro-drifts are needed. Perhaps a more detailed description of the relation network (R) and embedding function (g) is required. What are the alternative ways to implement them and why proposed implementations work the best should also be addressed. I also suspect any off-the-shelf MLP used for the relation network is at the risk of overfitting. I would like to know authors' comments on that, whether they saw any overfitting isses? If possible, please provide the necessary ablations."

Are there any external features and time-related features used in the models? If so, how does their presence affect the overall meta-learning process? Knowing this can also help in evaluating the quality of the proposed framework against external signals which are much easier to learn from."
