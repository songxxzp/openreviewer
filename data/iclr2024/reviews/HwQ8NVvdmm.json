                "value": "This paper try to deal with two important subjects in deep learning field at the same time. - Quantization and Continual learning.\nQuantization is a promising way to reduce costs of deep neural networks inference. Furthermore, there is a way to reduce training cost that is much more huge than inference cost by using low bit numerical formats, which is called FQT (Fully Quantized Training). CL (Continual learning) is a research field that try to handle a realistic scenario; the number of categories are not fixed and new categories and data can be added while previous ones aren\u2019t available. \n\nHowever, FQT and training under CL scenarios are both harmful to the performance of networks. Thus, it is obvious that executing FQT under CL scenarios leads to unacceptable performance degradation. That\u2019s why it is hard to find a trial to deal with both subjects simultaneously, even though these two topics are much important in practice.\n\nTo solve this problem, the paper introduces Hadamard transform, which is an inexpensive operation, in the training process. By applying Hadamard transform and stochastic rounding to the backward pass of training process, the proposed method make FQT possible under CL scenarios, with little to no sacrifice in performance."

Moreover, there should be a comparison with previous methods when training from scratch, not just during continual learning.\n* The method proposed in the paper would be difficult to implement due to the requirement for stochastic rounding, which cannot be easily implemented in hardware, integer-based or otherwise.

Additionally, the paper does not explain any distinctive aspects compared to chunk-based accumulation proposed in other existing FQT methods [2].\n- There is a lack of detailed analysis regarding the overhead incurred by Hadamard transformations in the training process. Furthermore, in [1], Hadamard transformation was used effectively to manage outliers occurring in specific channels of the Transformer model. However, this paper lacks a clear explanation of why the Hadamard transformation is particularly necessary for CIL. In Section 3, the direct relevance of being 'more efficient in using available quantization levels' to performance is not well-established.\n- The rationale behind using stochastic rounding is unclear. In Figure 2 (right), the sensitivity of activation and gradient quantization in the backward pass to unbiased quantizers lacks a clear bridge of explanation. There is a lack of description regarding which factors among bias and variance make gradient and activation quantization in the backward pass challenging.\n- The hardware comparison is unfair. While this paper emphasizes the retention of performance with fewer accumulation bits compared to other FQT methods, the hardware evaluation is conducted against hardware using 16-bit activation/accumulation. This makes it difficult to intuitively understand how reducing the accumulation of bits benefits the hardware.\n\n[1] Xi et al., Training Transformers with 4-bit Integers\n[2] Wang et al., Training Deep Neural Networks with 8-bit Floating Point Numbers"
