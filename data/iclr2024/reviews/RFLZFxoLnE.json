Then, the authors additionally assume that the conditional distribution of the network output is isotropic Gaussian so that the Fisher matrix can be diagonalized by the same orthogonal transformation appearing in Jacobian SVD. Overall, this allows to analytically solve NGD dynamics. Then, the authors take the final network prediction at $t=\\infty$ from the obtained solution and derive an upper bound (eq.

In the case of a distribution shift between train and test data, it seems there is a potential in the proposed approach to improve generalization by comparing Fisher matrices calculated on train and validation data. In this regard, are there some intersections between your approach and paper [Canatar et al.,  2021](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/691dcb1d65f31967a874d18383b9da75-Paper.pdf)?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Overall, the paper feels rushed, with several typos in different places. This is not critical, but there are more conceptual concerns.\n\n**The role of NGD.** When focusing on the main goal of the paper, as given by the title, the authors analyze the generalization performance of the final predictor $f_{\\theta_\\infty}$ given by (21) with modification $\\varphi$ given within the class described by eq. (7) and (12). However, such a predictor simply corresponds to a complete fit of training residual $\\alpha(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{Y})$ projected on a set of eigenspaces selected according to criterion $c$. From this perspective, Modified NGD seems to be only one of many possibilities (and a fairly complicated one) for obtaining such a predictor. For example, first projecting the residual on the selected eigenspaces and then training basic Gradient descent till convergence would produce the same predictor. This raises a question of the actual role of NGD in the analysis and results provided in the paper.\n\n**Implication of final training dataset size.** The authors treat quite lightly the difference between quantities related to finite training size and those related to (presumably) infinite population distribution. For example, the equality (24) seems to be impossible to hold. As can be seen from its other form in eq. (50), the left-hand side can have only $N$ non-zero entries, while all entries of the right-hand side are presumably non-zero. This is just one implication of the broader issue of learning population quantities from finite number of observations, which is one of the main technical difficulties in references [8,10,17,26] provided in the manuscript and in some other works studying generalization error of kernel methods. \n\n**The upper bound.** Theorem 2 presents the modification $\\varphi$ that improves not the true error but its upper bound (54) derived in the appendix. In this regard, it would be reasonable to discuss this upper bound in the main text so there is more understanding of what is actually minimized. For example, I am not able to tell whether this bound based on the equivalence of norms in finite-dimensional spaces is typical in analysis of generalization error, and the authors do not give any references or comments about it. Also, I did not understand the transition from the first to the second line in eq. (54) - I would expect an additional term with the contribution from components of $\\xi^\\star$ orthogonal to directions with non-zero singular values of $\\mathbf{J}$.   \n\n**Differences between theoretical and experimental settings.** The experimental and theoretical settings are quite different. Most importantly, in theoretical settings, the network is in NTK regime with constant Jacobian, while the experiments are performed with realistic finite networks with Jacobian evolving through training. Because of this, the authors regularly update Fisher during training. This aspect, often termed Feature Learning, is one of the main challenges to NTK theory, and it would be good to address it more clearly in the experiment design to make the relation to the theory more transparent.  \n\nSmaller remarks and typos which do not significantly affect the quality of the paper\n- $1/N$ factor is missing in eq. (35). This is the reason for the not-very natural $N$ factor in the exponent $e^{-\\eta N \\sigma_0^2 t}$ in eq. (20).\n- It seems strange that predictor $f$ (not the conditional probability $\\widetilde{p}(y|x)$) depends on output $y$ in the definition of the Fisher matrix (just below eq. (5)).\n- Theorem 1 gives the solution for (continuous) gradient flow algorithm, but formula (8) describes (discrete) gradient descent. It would be better to explicitly mention that the theorem is for gradient flow."

There are also a few smaller questions.\n\nTheory related questions:\n- Assumptions 2 and 3 are similar and differ in whether the width is infinite or just very large. Is this distinction important at some point of the paper?\n- For the true data distribution $p_\\mathrm{data}(x,y)$, are outputs $y$ deterministic when conditioned on an input $x$? Proof of theorem 2 assumes it - see eq. (42) - but it seems to be not mentioned in the text of the main paper or appendix.\n\nExperiment related questions:\n- In Figure 5, Modified and basic NGD start from significantly different accuracy values. But should not they have the same starting point, with the difference being only in the gradient updates?  \n- Is it possible to extend plots in figures 1. and 3a.? Otherwise, from the current plots it looks like almost no dynamics is happening.\n- Is it possible to provide some baseline method for modification of Fisher matrix, so it will be possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the method proposed in the paper?"
