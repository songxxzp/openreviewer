Interpolation has been used and demonstrated for a long time [1, 2], the latent traversal has also been discovered before [3]. Despite this paper strikes the point that it focuses on diffusion models, but the authors should still consider proper comparisons or acknowledgments.\n\n* Given this problem has been studied before, especially interpolation, the technical contribution of this paper is very limited. Another major contribution claimed in the paper (learning a semantics-guided autoencoding diffusion model) has also been proposed in [4]. The formulation looks exactly the same.\n\n* It is not surprising that linear interpolation could lead to improved properties as studied widely in images and some in molecules (e.g. [3]), but the experimental details need to be included for a fair comparison and evaluation.\n\n* The template-based manipulation seems an interesting setup, but a more realistic one should be specifying a specific molecule and then manipulate that molecule, given the stochastic forward process of diffusion model, maybe it is not possible. The name of \"template-based\" manipulation seems referring to manipulate any given molecule rather than a randomly sampled molecule.\n\n* [Minor] The explanation of stability and validity seems to be different from the literature, see e.g. [5].\n\n[1] G\u00f3mez-Bombarelli, R., Wei, J.N., Duvenaud, D., Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato, J.M., S\u00e1nchez-Lengeling, B., Sheberla, D., Aguilera-Iparraguirre, J., Hirzel, T.D., Adams, R.P. and Aspuru-Guzik, A., 2018.

GEOM mol stability metrics are not given (only atom stability).\n- The property manipulation does not seem to meaningfully alter the template, but mostly move atoms around and break/form some bonds. As a result, the results of property manipulation do not appear to be in equilibrium, but arbitrary conformations. Energies and atomic forces need to be carefully checked, since the optimized molecular properties are only meaningful in equilibrium. Beyond that, as far as I can tell, the property models have been trained on equilibirum molecules, i.e. they might be out of their domain of applicability at arbitrary conformations.\n- In Table 3, \"retrieval\" baseline yields similar results to egDiffAE, in some properties even performing better.

However, the way it has been proposed seems ad-hoc to me. It is unclear what the \u201csemantic encoding\u201d is learning if the only loss is MMD with Gaussian.\n- The metrics used on the experiments are not very convincing. The authors only use validity and atom stability\u2014metrics that are known to be not very informative of the quality of the samples. I would recommend the authors to use the MiDi metrics (Vignac et al, 23) at a minimum. It is also not clear to me that the \u201csmootheness\u201d metric used is very informative. The results shown on Table 2 (mean +- std for both \u201csmootheness mean\u201d and \u201csmootheness std\u201d are not clear).\n- The authors do not compute any measure of uniqueness/diversity of the generated molecules. It would be nice to see how diverse are the generated samples in this setting (since it is very important to generate diverse molecules in practice).

For `smoothness` and `midpoint similarity`, how are the similarity scores calculated? Do you use cosine similarity on embeddings?
