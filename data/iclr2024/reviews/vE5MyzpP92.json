While image retrieval mostly uses metrics like mAP or Recall@k, face verification relies heavily on thresholds and uses metrics like TAR@FAR. The introduced method appears more suited for face verification than image retrieval.\n\n- The paper suggests that high accuracy doesn't always mean high threshold consistency. However, in face verification tasks, consistency in threshold often translates to high accuracy. This amplifies the sense that the paper might be focusing on an unrelated task.\n\n- The paper mentions related works like Liu et al. (2022) and OneFace, but experiments comparing the proposed method to these in the realm of face recognition are missing. Such comparisons are necessary to understand the proposed method's improvements in threshold consistency.\n\n- The paper needs to update state-of-the-art results on the CUB and Cars-196 datasets [1].\n[1] Kim et al., HIER: Metric Learning Beyond Class Labels via Hierarchical Regularization, CVPR 23"

Existing DML methods often result in uneven representation structures within and between classes, leading to significant variations in performance across different test classes and data distributions, measured by false accept rate (FAR) and false reject rate (FRR). To tackle this issue, the authors propose a novel variance-based metric called Operating-Point-Inconsistency-Score (OPIS) to quantify the inconsistency in threshold performance across classes. They observe a trade-off between accuracy and threshold consistency, where improving accuracy can negatively impact threshold consistency. To mitigate this trade-off, they introduce the Threshold-Consistent Margin (TCM) loss, a simple yet effective regularization technique that penalizes difficult sample pairs to encourage uniform representation structures across classes. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that TCM enhances threshold consistency while maintaining or even improving accuracy, simplifying the threshold selection process in practical DML applications. The key contributions of the paper include the introduction of the OPIS metric, the identification of the accuracy-threshold consistency trade-off, and the proposal of the TCM loss as a solution to improve threshold consistency in DML. The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various large-scale image retrieval benchmarks, achieving significant improvements in threshold consistency."
