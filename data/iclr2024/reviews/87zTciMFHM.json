This needs to be empirically demonstrated. In the related work section, it is noted \u201c.. they (DeepProbLog, Scallop, SLASH) may result in biased learning.\u201d. If the proposed method can overcome this limitation empirically, outperforming the existing ones, it would strengthen the paper\u2019s claim. Otherwise, it isn't easy to see how the proposed framework is superior to these existing ones.\n\n### Lack of experiments on more challenging datasets/tasks.\nMoreover, the experiments are conducted on synthetic datasets and MNIST-addition datasets, which are relatively simple. Empirical results on more complex/large datasets would be needed to support the main claim of the paper, i.e. the proposed method is scalable. Visual Question Answering with Reasoning  (VQAR) task has been proposed and addressed by Scallop. How would the proposed method scale to such a more challenging task? Would they gain advantages compared to existing methods such as Scallop and SLASH?\n\n\nTo this end, unfortunately, I found the paper somewhat not easy to follow. \n- Many concepts are introduced and defined without clear specification of their motivations. Before/after introducing new formal concepts, explaining why we need them or providing more concrete examples would help readers understand the paper clearly.\n- Some undefined terms are used. In definition 1, it is noted \u201crules in R are violated\u201d, but the term\u201cviolated\u201d is not defined. \n- Some definitions of first-order logic are unclear. In Section 2, Herbrand base is explained as the set of all atoms, but Herbrand base usually refers to a set of *ground* atoms. Does $\\mathcal{H}$ contain atoms with variables or only ground atoms?\n- In Section 5.2, the proposed method is compared to different baselines, but no description of baselines is available in the main text. There are no references to the corresponding papers. The experimental setup needs to be clarified more to be self-contained.\n\nI list some minor comments:\n- In section 3.3, in the first line, the summation has $j$ as the index, but it is not used in the log-likelihood.\n- $\\nu$ seems dependent on ruleset R, i.e. when $\\nu$ appears, a ruleset is assumed. Clarifying this more would help readers to understand.\n- Providing some examples after definitions would be helpful."

Overall, it could be a very nice paper presenting some interesting ideas, but it needs a bit more work. \n\nBelow, more detailed comments can be found:\n\n- The main claim of the paper is that this recipe helps in making NeSy models more scalable. However, there is no computational complexity analysis, nor there is an experiment that shows the gains in terms of memory/computational time with respect to other state-of-the-art models. Could you add something along these lines?\n\n- The paper states that their goal is to address the scalability issues typical of Nesy learning. However, all their framework is based on ProbLog and its extensions. While ProbLog and DeepProbLog represent vital milestones for the NeSy community, conflating these models with all NeSy models is an overstatement. The title should probably then something about making ProbLog scalable, not all Nesy models. Similarly, the intro should be rewritten in this light. \n\n- why did you define the weights $w_{x,f}$ such that $\\sum_{f \\in \\Omega_q} w_{x,f}=1$? Does it have some probabilistic interpretation? If so, couldn't their sum be different from 1?\n\n- when you give the definition of rules, you specify that the body is made of literals, what about $a$? (I guess it must always be positive, but it should be stated that it is an atom)\n\n- the definition of explained seems the same as supported in logic programs. Why don't you draw a parallel between the two concepts?\n\n- in definition 5 you suddenly start talking about clauses instead of rules. Why didn't you just stick to rules? Also, introducing clausing generates the problem that they have multiple rewritings (e.g., $\\neg A \\vee B$ can be rewritten both as $A \\to B$ and $\\neg B \\to A$).\n\n- Afterwards, you write that this is similar to the concept of stratification. How is it similar and how is it different? The definition of stratification revolves around the negative atoms appearing in the body of the rules, while in definition 5 the negation is not mentioned.\n\n- in algorithm 1 there is the function \"unit propagate\" that I don't see explained anywhere (as this is an ML conference I think it should be explained). Again, in algorithm 1 there is written \"smallest clause in $\\phi$\" according to $\\le_q$. However, if I understand correctly, $\\le_q$ defines a partial order. Hence, how do you define the \"smallest clause\"? If my understanding is correct, you might have multiple orders all valid, does picking different orders have an impact on the final explanation?\n\n- as the paper seems to rely a lot on GFLowNets I would recommend the addition of a small paragraph where they are explained and the relevant theory is added\n\n- why there is in caption of Table 1 written \"EXL is our EXAL method without the AGREE step.\"? EXL is not mentioned anywhere else\n\n- the authors state \"EXAL is competitive with A-NeSI and provides state-of-the-art performance, with the desired reference accuracy always within margin of error\".
