                "value": "From what I gathered, the solution the authors provided is to reduce the number of parameters from PFRNN by avoiding the convolutional encoding of the environment factors. The authors argued about that PFRNN\u2019s parameters are proportional to the environment size, however this is true only because PFRNN has a flatten layer which flattens the environment into a long vector. Such a \u201cflatten\u201d approach greatly inflates the number of parameters and have been abandoned in the deep learning community since the inception of ResNet in 2015. Hence, I think this approach ought to make a baseline comparison to the global average pooling approach that has been adopted since ResNet, if not newer transformer-based approaches. If one uses global average pooling instead of flatten, then PFRNN\u2019s # of parameters won\u2019t scale with environment size, and we would have a much more fair comparison between the baseline and the proposed approach.\n\nThere are some confusing parts in the comparison to PFRNN too. In eq. (12), the authors presented their approach of encoding the x and y as being novel, however I don\u2019t see a significant difference between that and the paragraph after eq. (9), where we also see PFRNN encoding x and y after 2 linear layers as n and m. Is there a significant difference between this and eq. (12) besides the fact that concatenation is done at a slightly different place?\n\nBesides, there are some other differences such as multiplying some state feature vectors instead of concatenating them, which I don\u2019t think was discussed in enough detail about the motivation and the performance gains it provides. \n\nAlso, I am not convinced, from the standard deviation numbers the authors provided, that this approach is truly better than the baselines. The standard deviations are routinely 3-4 times of the mean, which I believe would lead to any statistical tests to indicate most of the differences shown in the tables to be statistically insignificant.\n\nOther issues:\n\nI don\u2019t agree calling eq. (8) \u201cperturbation with random noise\u201d that seems to be misleading. What eq. (8) really does is just a resampling of the particles with replacement. It would be better to clarify the terminology.\n\nThe font size of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are too small to be legible. Besides, the presentation approach of showing huge sets of equations with changes of variable names (between e.g. eq. (11) and eq. (13) and just hoping that the readers will figure out what is different is not a great practice. It would be much easier if the authors delineate clearly what are the differences between eq. (11) and eq. (13).\n\nOverall: \n\nIn general, the authors have not shown sufficient evidence to convince me that this algorithm they proposed is novel enough, or it significantly reduces the number of parameters and the model size, or whether it improves the results or not. I also do not believe this work is well-presented, because of its resolution on having readers to read through long equations. Hence, I cannot argue for this paper\u2019s acceptance at this stage."

I feel this could be a simple model variant rather than a novel technical contribution that warrants a separate publication.\n- The method is evaluated in quite simple grid world environments, in a narrow setting with beacons placed in the environment.

By integrating the classical particle filter with the gated recurrent unit (GRU) RNN framework, the researchers have developed a memory-efficient particle filter RNN model (mePFRNN). Notably, the mePFRNN boasts an invariant parameter count regardless of the environment size, marking a substantial improvement in memory efficiency over its predecessor, the PFRNN model. The model's effectiveness was evaluated in symmetrical and noisy conditions, where traditional filtering algorithms typically struggle. The findings indicate that the mePFRNN outperforms existing models in accuracy while also requiring fewer parameters to be trained, highlighting its potential for more efficient and precise object localization tasks."
