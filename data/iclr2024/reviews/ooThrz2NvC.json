The absence of comprehensive ablation studies is a notable weakness. The paper would greatly benefit from detailed analyses that demonstrate the specific contributions and impact of the proposed mask-based prediction methodology. \n3. The explanation of key methodologies, especially the evidence retrieval module, is vague. Given its critical role in enhancing ICD coding performance, a more in-depth discussion of its design and functionality is essential for readers to fully understand and replicate the study. \n4. Certain claims appear unsubstantiated, creating potential confusion. For instance, the assertion regarding the brevity of diagnoses in Chinese EMRs contradicts common characteristics seen in datasets like MIMIC. This discrepancy necessitates clarification to maintain the paper's credibility. \n5. The paper exhibits limited novelty when viewed against the backdrop of existing studies like [1]. The underdeveloped evidence retrieval module further diminishes the perceived innovativeness of the CICD-Coder framework. A more thorough exploration of these elements could help underline the unique contributions of the current study. \n\n[1] Yang Z, Wang S, Rawat B P S, et al.

Unless there is a strong reason and explanation for using only two baselines, the authors could consider using more.\n3. In 2.2.1, the author says that **We have prior information about the likely appearance location of the supporting evidence in the medical record by professional ICD coders**. In the last sentence, they say that this prior information makes the process **fast and efficient**. Given that the paper is application-oriented, I wonder what would happen when practitioners do not have this prior information. It seems to be that having such prior information is a strong assumption.\n4.

I am not sure whether those two principles are specific to Chinese EMRs. It seems to me that those two principles could broadly apply to EMRs in most countries. Thus, it is debatable whether the design of the principles is specific to Chinese EMR, which makes those two design principles seem a bit too general. I wonder whether the authors have any idea about the specific design of the principles."

To enhance the precision of their predictions, the authors propose incorporating additional evidence after the initial ICD prediction. They accomplish this by training a retrieval model designed to retrieve the relevant evidence corresponding to a given diagnosis. Their findings suggest an improvement in ICD coding accuracy on Chinese datasets, albeit with limited exploration. Nevertheless, the paper is deemed in need of substantial revision, and in my opinion, it is not yet ready for publication."
