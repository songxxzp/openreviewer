It is true that many existing methods handle evaluation pipelines themselves, and inconsistencies in the evaluation pipelines make the comparison of different methods unreliable. For example, as the authors pointed out, LocalRetro measured a relaxed notion of accuracy where a prediction can be deemed correct even if its stereochemistry is different from the dataset, while the baseline methods do not. This makes the comparison of LocalRetro and baseline methods unfair and unreliable. The contribution is significant since the community indeed needs a well-established evaluation pipeline for a fair evaluation. \n\n2. The authors examined the previous retrosynthesis works carefully and pointed out the shortcomings of different methods in this practice. They also suggest the best evaluation practices via the Python package SYNTHESEUS which supports consistent evaluation of single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis algorithms, with best practices enforced by default.\n\n3.  The authors further re-evaluate existing methods, both single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis, with the proposed SYNTHESEUS pipeline and show the real effectiveness of different methods."

Suggest careful considerations on the suggested post-processing procedures. Is it true the best practice should be to only consider valid molecules when computing top-k accuracy? I agree with the authors that invalid molecules can be removed easily. However, the ability to generate valid molecules is also important. Otherwise, the model might need to generate multiple invalid molecules before a valid molecule, which consumes more time compared to the case where the first generated molecule is valid.
