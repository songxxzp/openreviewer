The authors propose to build knowledge graphs for medical concepts in EHR datasets. They first extract relations for every medical concept and then apply node/edge clustering based on word embeddings. Finally, they design a node-level and visit-level attention method to predict medical events. Experimental results show that the proposed method can largely enhance the event prediction performance."
