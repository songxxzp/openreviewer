The authors first demonstrate the drawback of existing dataset condensation methods in this area and analyze the inefficiency of a naive solution that involves solving nested optimization. Then, through theoretical analysis, they propose a hyperparameter-calibrated dataset condensation method. The basic idea is to learn a synthetic validation dataset such that hypergradients on hyperparameters can be matched. They also apply effective approximation to further reduce the complexity so that the final algorithm is a first-order one. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both image and graph datasets."

To better demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the proposed method, experiments on larger datasets like ImageNet, at least subsets of ImageNet or TinyImageNet, are encouraged.\n2. Limited Analysis. The authors only focus on the performance on several datasets. The analysis on the algorithm itself is insufficient. Specifically, how does the algorithm compare to the naive solution in Eq. 3 in terms of both performance and efficiency. The authors may consider using a toy dataset for this analysis. After all, the proposed method is an efficient approximation of directly using original datasets. Where the approximation comes from and how much it is are important in a scientific view.\n3. I am curious about the details of the method to deal with discrete hyperparameters. The descriptions in Sec. 5.2 and Appendix H are confusing to me. An algorithmic flow is encouraged for better presentation. In addition, are other approaches like Gumbel Softmax applicable?\n4. Eq. IFT is an efficient approximation of the hypergradients. It would be better to make this clear in the description. And \"=\" should not be used in Eq. IFT.\n5. Minor: some confusing expersions:\n   * \"this limitation\" in the second paragraph of Introduction: the contents in the previous paragraph is not actually a limitation. And this sentence is incoherent to the last sentence of the previous paragraph.\n   * The last two lines in Page 5.\n   * Page 6: \"For generating $S^{train}$, We ...\", \"W\" here should be lowercase."
