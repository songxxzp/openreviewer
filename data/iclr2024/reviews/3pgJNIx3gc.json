The extra compute resources costs are significant in this plan, including both the distillation and the extra cost in evaluating / backpropagating L_sc. No justification of these extra computational costs is presented.\n\nW2. A generated sequence with high plDDT generally means that it is *conservative* (easy to be predicted), but this is not an indicator that it corresponds to the target structure. Therefore, using plDDTs intuitively encourage \"sequence stability\" instead of \"structural consistency\". Two concepts are confused in this paper.\n\nW3. Paper needs proofreading.\n\nW4. In the evaluation part, the authors confused pTMs from AFD as TM. This metric lacks commonsense and is misleading, because it is totally irrelevant with the target structure. Under such evaluation, the elevation in so-called self consistency is trivial. The real TM between a structure prediction and the target structure should be reported."
