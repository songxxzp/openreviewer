At each step in the episode, the system gets to observe the current state and proposed a ranked list of items and the environment provides a click on one of the items according to the cascading click model. For this problem, the paper provides a method for computing the optimal offline strategy when all distributions are known and an introduces the CascadingVI algorithm along with a regret bound of $O(H\\sqrt{HSNK})$, where $H$ is the episode length, $S$ is the number of states, $K$ the number of episodes and $N$ is the number of individual items available to rank. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared numerically with a baseline algorithm produced by adapting an existing algorithm to the combinatorial space, referred to here as AdaptRM."

I believe we have well-known recipes for how such algorithms can be formulated since the papers on Cascading Bandits from 2015 (Kveton et. al, Combes et al.). Providing a solution scaling with the number of items is expected in my opinion and not a surprising contribution (we know that estimating individual CTRs is enough to construct optimal rankings, we don't need to keep statistics on each individual ranking). This also leads me to believe the baseline used in the numerical experiments is weak. \n- The contribution related to the generalization to MDPs is not opening a significant amount of new doors. In my opinion, this generalization does not provide further theoretical insights and has limited additional practical relevance.\n- The experimental section use a setting that is too simplistic (very few items and states) and a weak baseline, in my opinion, thus not being representative enough of what we can expect from this algorithm in practice."

How does your proposed algorithm navigate this difficulty? \n\nI would also like to see more intuition regarding the exploration bonus $b^{k, pV}(s, a)$, in particular: how is the optimism of $\\overline{V}^k_h(s)$ connected to the uncertainty in the estimates of state transition probabilities $p$? The algorithm is already fairly convoluted and it is hard to see how we can construct optimistic estimates of the value functions in light of estimation noise in the state transition probabilities. I believe it is very valuable to clearly articulate such insights in the main body of the paper."

Do you think that this is realistic in practice?  \n\n- It would be great if you could go into a bit more detail in your related work section and more clearly highlight the differences to prior models. For example, in contrast to the classical cascading bandits, the order of items also matters in your case as you usually would like the item with largest reward in state s to be clicked. \n\nMinor things: \n- In the 4th contribution, I found the statement about \"$\\varepsilon$ sufficiently large\" slightly confusing.

They also introduced two RL algorithms: CascadingVI for regret minimization and CascadingBPI for sample complexity, both of which utilize BestPerm to achieve polynomial regret and sample complexity.\n\nCascadingVI achieves near-optimal regret matching a known lower bound. CascadingBPI offers efficient computation and sample complexity, reaching near-optimal performance.\n\nIn summary, the paper contributes a new cascading RL framework that efficiently handles the computational and sample complexity challenges of stateful item selection, supported by theoretical guarantees and demonstrated effectiveness through experiments."
