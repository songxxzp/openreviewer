CSA utilizes Sinkhorn\u2019s algorithm to assign labels to only the data samples with high confidence scores, eliminating the need to predefine the heuristic thresholds used in existing pseudo-labeling methods. In terms of theory,this paper study the pseudo-labelling process when training on labeled set and predicting unlabeled data using a PAC-Bayes generalization bound. CSA specifies the frequency of assigned labels including the lower bound and upper bound per class as well as the fraction of data points to be assigned. Then, the optimal transport will automatically perform row and column scalings. Additionally, this paper proposes to use the Integral Probability Metrics to extend and improve the existing PAC-Bayes bound which relies on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence."

More number of unlabeled data is useful for a good estimation. Less number of classes and less number of input dimensions will make the estimation easier. The analysis takes a step further to show that both aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty can reduce the probability of obtaining a good estimation.\n\nIn the experiment, all models use the same backbone network, and the settings of the models are described in comparison to it. Experimental verification shows that optimal transport cannot be achieved simply by changing the threshold value.The paper also conducts other empirical analysis which can be sensitive to the performance."

This work proposes a Pseudo-Labeling algorithm based on a confident score derived from ensemble models.  Firstly, a mathematical proof is presented to elucidate the impact of uncertainty in classifiers. Welch\u2019s T-test is employed to ascertain whether the most likely class holds statistically greater significance than the second-most likely class. This serves to diminish uncertainty in the estimated classifiers. Subsequently, the label allocation process is transferred to the optimization of the optimal transport problem, and the Sinkhorn Algorithm is employed to swiftly approximate the solution. Moreover, this study establishes PAC-Bayes results using Integral Probability Metrics, which provides a guarantee of generalization performance. Additionally, comprehensive experiments are devised to facilitate a comparative evaluation with other relevant works in the field."

In Algorithm 1, Confident Sinkhorn Label Allocation (simplified), the derivation of b_{-} and b_{+} when setting marginal distributions is not explicitly stated. Based on the content, it is inferred that they are empirically estimated from the class label frequency in the training data or from prior knowledge.

Are there alternative, more dependable methods for comparing the most probable class with the second most probable class? (Except those compared in the appendix) \n2. In the appendix, it is noted that the computational time of XGBoost increases with each iteration. Could this escalation in computational time become substantial when applied on a larger scale, potentially resulting in inefficiencies that outweigh its benefits?\n3. I've noted that in the algorithm when \u03c1 equals 1, it indicates full allocation. Additionally, I observed a limited elucidation regarding this parameter. In the appendix, \u03c1 is configured to allocate more data points in the earlier iterations and fewer in the later ones. I am intrigued by the potential impact of varying \u03c1. While this obviates the necessity to predefine a suitable threshold \u03b3, it introduces a new variable, \u03c1, necessitating a predefined value. Is the outcome sensitive to the choice of \u03c1? Is there a universally applicable \u03c1 that ensures the algorithm's effectiveness across diverse tasks? The role of \u03c1 in the algorithm appears somewhat ambiguous, and I am particularly keen on gaining a deeper understanding of it."

Secondly, the expression for the probabilistic classifiers, specifically $f_k(x_i)$, is stated to produce a scalar value indicating the likelihood of $x_i$ being labeled as $k$. However, the provided formulation $f_k(x_i):=\\mathcal{N}(x_i|\\hat\\theta_k,\\Lambda)$ suggests it's a function mapping to a normal distribution parameterized by $x_i\\vert\\hat\\theta_k$ and $\\Lambda$.\n5.
