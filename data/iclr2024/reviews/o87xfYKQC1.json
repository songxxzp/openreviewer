I believe there are some pieces of missing information:\n    1. coefficient matrices $A$ and $B$ capture channel-wise relationship.\n    2. The pattern and correlation encoded in the channel are related to the positional information. \n    3. the coefficient matrices $A$ and $B$ (indirectly) capture the relationship between each position.\nMaybe it is trivial for some readers but it is not for me.\n\n2. There are some of the questions about PDE.\n    1. (page 4) \u201cThey represent a theoretical extension of FINOLA from a discrete grid to continuous coordinates.\u201c This is not intuitive to me. As far as I understand, the proposed method in this paper is also using the discrete grid. Assuming that the extension to continuous coordinates is to get a better theoretical understanding, what is the insight and take away from the fact that Eq. 1 becomes the formulation of PDE in Eq. 4?\n    2. (page 4) \u201cEstablishing their theoretical validity poses a substantial challenge.\u201d  What is the substantial challenge?\n3. The specific method of the block-wise Masked FINOLA is unclear. For example, if we see the Corner case, let\u2019s say an input coordinate is (3,2) and it is used for predicting {(11,10), (11,2), (3,10)}. I guess for obtaining (11,2), for instance, the function $\\phi^8(z(3,2))$ is applied, which means (4,2) is predicted first and it is used as an input for predicting (5,2) and so forth. My question is, considering that we already have a ground truth within (0,2),(1,2) \u2026, (7,2), why not use the ground truth information?\n4. How is the Gaussian curvature related to capturing semantics? Could you add more detailed descriptions of how it is computed?\n5. (Table 4 (a)) Even though Stable Diffusion is a Generative Model, I believe it should have better PSNR than FINOLA for the image reconstruction task. How did you implement the image reconstruction task for Stable Diffusion?\n6. How fast is the parallel implementation (Fig. 3) compared to the regular AR setting?\n7. Is this method fast enough to use as a feature extractor for the downstream task?"
