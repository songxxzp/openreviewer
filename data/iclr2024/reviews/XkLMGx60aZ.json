For this task, they discuss a genetic algorithm based approach to identify the optimal distribution. A neural network (U-Net) is used to estimate the impact of placement of each tree on aggregate MRT. This U-Net is used to approximate a process-based model that estimates point-wise MRT based on meteorological and vegetation features. A counterfactual-based analysis is also carried out, where optimal placement of even existing trees are considered in addition to new ones."

As far as I know, ERA5 data is only available on 30m resolution; how do you get to 1m resolution? Where do your digital elevation and surface models, your land cover, wall aspects and height, and sky view factor maps come from?\n2. Benchmarking traditional physical model would be highly appreciated to understand the performance of your U-Net in terms of accuracy. That is, does your method incur a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and, in particular, how accurate is your U-Net to approximate $T_{mrt}$?\n3. Is SOLVEIG a traditional model and do you benchmark this? Please help readers by clarifying this more thoroughly. What does an `L1 error of 1.93K` mean, is it computed between U-Net output and ground truth, or between U-Net output and SOLVEIG output?\n5. Given that the solar incoming radiation $I_g$ has the biggest impact, how does the tree position make a difference? An ablation comparing the effect on $T_{mrt}$ caused by number of trees vs. the positioning of the trees would be interesting. Also, seing Figure 4, I do not quite agree that the number of trees saturates (although it certainly will at some point). In short: Does the number of trees or their position contribute more to a better $T_{mrt}$? (I have seen your comment `Notably, the improvement by relocation of existing trees is significantly larger than the effect of 50 added trees [...]`, but I could not quite understand the quantitative effect of each treatment, i.e., #trees vs position)."

To what kind of tree does $t_g$ used in your experiments relate?\n4. Why does your algorithm suggest to populate east-to-west passages more densely? Wouldn't this prevent wind to transport hot air out of the city in summer?

Furthermore, the estimation is performed in an aggregated fashion, which can yield substantial speed-ups while sacrificing an acceptable amount of accuracy. \n\nThe authors pair this estimation of the objective with a heuristic local search technique comprising several components. The method is applied to the optimization of tree placements within a city, and shows improved performance over either component in isolation. Furthermore, there are interesting insights regarding the impact of tree cover on temperature as a function of time, the diminishing impact of additional trees, and the \"what-if\" scenario concerning the impact of an alternative, optimized placement over the one that currently exists."

In my opinion, the methodological contributions of the paper are thin, and essentially boil down to 1) estimating the aggregated radiant temperatures directly instead of individually and 2) integrating this estimation in a standard local search procedure. These are both fairly straightforward. The \"theoretical analysis\" in Section 3.1 is extremely tenuous and, in my opinion, should not be branded as such.\n\n**W2**. The evaluation does not include error bars and confidence intervals, which are a must for drawing reliable conclusions from the results, given the stochasticity of the methods (bar greedy search which is deterministic; but given the estimation itself is learned, one could consider an experimental design where the \"seed\" for the estimation varies in a paired fashion).\n\n**W3**. There is a potential fundamental limitation in the considered objective, which does not include any measure of population density, traffic, or footfall for the areas. \n\n- In my opinion, this is potentially problematic as the optimization procedure may find solutions where trees are placed in places that yield good deltas in the temperature metric, and yet are comparatively less (or not at all) populated. \n- Hence, the placements may trivially not lead to decreases in thermal comfort experienced by individuals, given that an area is not actually frequented by people. \n- This is potentially alluded to in the text (bottom of page 8) and acknowledged in Section 5, but I think it deserves to be addressed in more depth. \n- For example, it may be that the density is sufficiently uniform in the considered grid that this is not an issue. Evidence that the approach does not \"game\" the objective would also counteract this point."
