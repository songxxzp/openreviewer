In particular, given a masked image, the proposed method iteratively inpaints masked pixels by a GAN model, as well as the variance of the generated pixel. By keeping the low variance pixels the masked area is reduced. Then this step is repeated until the entire masked area is filled. \n\nThe authors did comprehensive evaluations with other methods and showed that the proposed method achieves the best performance and is more computationally efficient."

Also, since at each iteration, the entire image is generated, the whole process is scalable to high-resolution and large-hole inpainting problems. The experiments show strong numerical evidence of the performance of the method. Overall the paper is well-written and solid."
