The  original detailed balance equation represents the reversibility of the Markov chain; the proposed method, in contrast, does not satisfy such condition as it is seemingly assymetrical with backwards flow. One possible way would be to consider the right hand side a factorisation of the transition function $\\tilde{P}_B(s | s\u2019, y) = P_B (s | s\u2019, y) R(x|y)$ but that won\u2019t give $\\int \\tilde{P}_B(s | s\u2019, y) ds = 1$. One can interpret it that it works as a regularisation of the loss function in Eq (5). Another related question relates to the transition between Eq 14 and Eq 15 in the Appendix related to the proof of this statement. It is not clear where did $R(x|y)$ disappear in between  Eq. (14) and (15). In the standard case of the detailed balance equation, that would have been a valid transition, but why is it valid for the non-1 R(x|y)?\n\nQ2: Not sure I completely understand how the number of discovered modes (normalised and unnormalised) is calculated  (see Figures 10 and 11)?\n\nQ3: \u201cA remarkable aspect of GFlowNets is the ability to demonstrate the reasoning potential in generating a task-specific policy.\u201c Not sure the word reasoning would be the right way to describe it as I am not sure it is objective; despite not necessarily agreeing with the wording, I do think the meaning behind it, i.e. transferring to the task without re-training (Section 4.2), is a valuable aspect."

Since this involves the computation of an intractable sum, they amortize it with a learned predictor.\n- The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their fine-tuned OC-GFNs on toy (GridWorld & BitSequence) and real-world biology problems (DNA binding, RNA generation, AMP generation), with some ablations on the toy problems."

While the pretraining solution is not particularly novel, it\u2019s a neat application of goal-condition RL to an amortized sampling problem. The authors also figured out how to make it work on a wide range of problems, and provide several ablations in the main text and the appendix.\n- The insight that a new sampling policy can be readily obtained from an outcome-conditioned flow is neat and, as far as I can tell, novel.

Namely, that transfer is only possible when the reward function changes but not if the action-space or the state-space change. Moreover, the goal-conditioning requires a well specified set of outcomes Y \u2014 presumably not all states s are terminal states \u2014 which makes the proposed method not truly unsupervised. These limitations (together with the applicability mentioned at the end of A.2) could be stated explicitly in the main text, and left to future work.\n- While there are enough benchmarks, I believe none include continuous action/state spaces. Moreover, the experiments only one GFN variant \u2014 the detailed-balance one, which is also used for OC-GFN. It would help validate the generality of OC if we had experiments showing it worked on these different settings. Moreover, I\u2019d be curious to know how other pretrained amortized sampling baselines (eg, VAEs, normalizing flows) fare against OC-GFN \u2014\u00a0and what about pretraining a GFN on task A (without OC) and fine-tuning it on task B?\n- (minor) The second and fourth paragraphs of Section 4.2 mention the \u201creasoning potential\u201d of GFNs, and that intractable marginalization leads to \u201cslow thinking\u201d. Are these anthropomorphisms really needed for this paper?\n- (minor) I wished the preliminaries (Section 2) included a training objective like Eq. 5 & 9, and that these more clearly specified which are the optimization variables.\n- Some typos, there maybe more:\n    - p. 3: multi-objective what?\n    - p. 4: \u201cgiven a reward R a posterior as a function\u201d\n    - p. 4: autotelicly \u2192 autotelically?\n    - p. 5: \u201cin log-scale obtained from Eq.
