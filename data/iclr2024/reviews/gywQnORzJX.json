This matrix can be sparsified by magnitude clipping and also by omitting classes with low probability. Given the Fisher matrices for many examples, the \u201ccomponents\u201d are extracted by approximately factorizing the Fisher matrix in a fashion close to non-negative matrix factorization. The authors also shows how the extracted matrices can be used to relate changes in model parameters to changes in the outputs. Experimentally the authors considers two settings: image classification with Resnets and NLP tasks with a finetuned BERT model. In Figure 1 and 2 the authors visualize some found components, in figure 3 they also show that the model is sensitive in the directions uncovered by NPEFF. Additionally, a comparison with toy data with known ground truth components is done, some ablation experiments are included and a comparison to a previous interpretability strategy is conducted."

While the first half of the papers reads fine and I'm able to follow, the motivation for the experiments, their setup, and the very results themselves are quite unclear to me. For example, the authors claim all \"directions\" unveiled by their method encodes some \"concept\" used by Tracr for manually performing the tasks discussed therein. It is entirely unclear though what a \"concept\" means---is it mere addition, a Tracr primitive, a composition of primitives, etc.? Such lack of clarity generally left me confused throughout the paper, such that I was not certain what the implication of any of the experiments was. This made it hard for me to judge the paper.\n\nPracticality: While the authors conduct experiments on a BERT model, the proposed method requires at least linear in number of parameters memory. I'm uncertain of the scalability of this approach, therefore. Of course several methods suffer from this problem, but it will be worth discussing this in the paper.\n\n**Post rebuttals comment:** I appreciate the authors' comments. Having gone through the updated paper, other reviewers' comments, and the rebuttals to them, I do think the paper has improved. I still found the writing unclear at times (e.g., while I get what \"tunings\" are, I don't understand why the term is suddenly informally defined and then casually used thereafter, making the paper confusing to me at points). I'm increasing my score to 5 however, given the updates and responses."
