Regarding BraTS dataset: In general, I'm not a big fan of BraTS dataset, since its real-valued images. Therefore, one big problem is that if you perform Fourier Transform, the k-space is conjugate symmetric, and the undersampling factor is not what it is. For example, ACR = 8 effectively represents ACR = 4, this can be miss leading. Please refer and consider citing the paper: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2117203119 Implicit data crimes: Machine learning bias arising from misuse of public data, that discussed this problem. I won't against using BraTS (its a great dataset), but should mention this issue.\n\nMeanwhile, I would appreciate more results on FastMRI dataset, I only see one visual example - Figure 5, without the undersampling pattern, and much descriptions.\n\n3. From results in Figure 2, I am amazed but also confused on the third column ACR=24, despite the effective undersampling rate, with only a few lines, I don't expect the model accurately predicting the tumor. Could you please elaborate on this results? I would like to learn more on what you think?\n\nMinor problems:\n\n1. The figures are not of high-resolution and some of them are compressed. For example, Figure 5, I can actually see jpeg artifacts in all images, which is not acceptable for imaging related papers. Please fix this problem. Also the knee orientation is up-side-down, please fix it.\n\n2.

The only \"theoretical\" grounding is proposition 3.1 which to me amounts a bit to mathiness given its simplicity. Another example is the introduction of the discrepancy gradient which is not discussed.\n- **Results**: given how good the results are, it's important to question why the improvement is so big. If I focus on knee MRI reconstruction, there is a +4dB improvement in PSNR: this is absolutely huge but it isn't discussed. In particular, it should be viewed in comparison with fully supervised methods like the ones presented in the 2019 fastmri challenge which are nowhere near the performance reported here. \n- **Code**: while some code is provided, the README has not been updated from the Wang et al. repo, which makes it difficult to know how to look at the relevant code, i.e. where the new sampling method is introduced.\n\n\nNitpicks:\nThe paper is 10 page-long rather than 9, but it's just due to a figure that slipped into the 10th page."

To this end, a model named Meta-Guided Diffusion Model (MGDM) is introduced to address the challenge of guiding unconditional predictions to align with measurement information through a bi-level guidance strategy (an outer level and an inner level ). The outer level optimizes for measurement consistency, while the inner level approximates the measurement-conditioned posterior mean as the initial prediction. Empirical results on medical datasets in MRI and CT demonstrate that MGDM outperforms existing methods by generating high-fidelity medical images that closely match measurements and reduce the occurrence of hallucinatory images."
