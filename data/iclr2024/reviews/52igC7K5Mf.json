In the equation 12 loss function, the right-hand side of the equation contains the time index $t$ and time series index $i$, and there is no summation regarding $t$ and $i$. Does this mean the loss function is computed for each time series $i$ at a specific time $t$? Personally, I do not think the loss function is linked to each $t$, but equation 12 seems to suggest otherwise.\n2. What is the value of the threshold $\\epsilon$ in equation 13 in the experiment, and how to determine it? Could you help me locate the place if you have stated it already in the paper?\n3. It is advisable to cite the related work in the first paragraph in section 2.3 regarding the existing approach?\n4. Can you clarify how you compute the True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR)? Do these metrics calculate from the F-norm of $W_{j,k}^n$? In other words, do they not only assess whether time series $j$ Granger-causes time series $i$ but also consider whether the lag is accurate? For instance, if the true lags are $1,2,3$, would lag $4$ from time series $j$ to $i$ be regarded as a False Positive?\n5. Given that the loss function is computed for each time series $i$, does this mean the whole algorithm will run $p$ times for $p$-variate time series?\n6. Table 3 shows that the cMLP algorithm outperforms the proposed algorithm. Since no other nonlinear experiment has been provided, does this imply that the proposed algorithm performs worse than the baselines in the nonlinear cases? Personally, I recommend conducting further nonlinear experiments to thoroughly examine the performance of the proposed algorithm in nonlinear cases.\n7. Can additional nonlinear experiments be conducted in section 3.3 on automatic lag selection, given that the Lorenz-96 dataset does not involve time lag? Since the proposed method did not yield the best performance in the Lorenz-96 dataset, might this also be the case in the time lag selection stage? Additional results would provide valuable insights.\n8. Can you offer more details regarding the procedure for generating the time series in section 3.4 on time-varying Granger causality inference? If, in the four scenarios, two sets of time series with different configurations are merged together with equal lengths, would this potentially favor the proposed algorithm? Considering that the multilevel fine-tuning algorithm separates input time series into $2^{i-1}$ segments, such a configuration might be advantageous. Furthermore, could you provide the information about the value of $i$ when the algorithm stops in the time-varying experiment?\n9. Still in section 3.4, how to do manual splitting? Does it utilize additional information about the true time series?\n10. Could you briefly explain why the algorithms mentioned in section A.2 have not been applied as baselines, though they ask to select the time lag manually?\n11.

It is therefore worthwhile to pursue alternative approaches like this one, which leverage alternative network architectures. On top of that, it's important to explore solutions for detecting time-varying Granger causal relationships."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Several questions and concerns:\n\n- It was difficult to follow the description of the mixer architecture, which is one of the main contributions of this work. If I understand correctly, it seems like the second projection in the mixer block, shown in eq. 8, actually mixes information between all the time series. If that's true, wouldn't it mean that every prediction depends on every time series? That should make it difficult to identify which predictors are important, because every forecast automatically depends on every input time series.\n\n- Again, it was hard to follow the description of the network architecture, but it seems like the predictions are ultimately based on an element-wise multiplication between the inputs and the output of the mixer block (this is then fed to a MLP). Would it be fair to interpret these as attention weights? It might be a helpful analogy, because similar notions of soft attention have been used in transparent deep learning.\n\n- I'll temporarily assume, following my question above, that the $W^{(n)}$ values can be viewed as attention weights. When we pass the attention-weighted inputs $M$ into the MLPs $g_i$, do we use separate attention weights for each $g_i$? Otherwise, it would seem that we're forced to make one set of selections for all predictions, whereas we should instead select the relevant inputs for the prediction corresponding to each output series. Either I'm missing something in the notation, or this seems like a restrictive choice.\n\n- It seems inconvenient that the weights $W^{(n)}$ determine the Granger causality relationships, but that they vary for every time point. Compared to the cMLP/cLSTM, it means that an input can be deemed non-causal only if it has small weights for all time points. Is that correct? \n\n- The authors claim that they cannot make the $W^{(n)}$ weights exactly equal to zero, even with the group lasso penalty. This seems correct, because the weights are the output of the mixer block. However, it is untrue that the cMLP/cLSTM share this issue: they regularize parameters of the network, and the parameters can reach zero exactly due to optimization with proximal updates. \n\n- The authors state that they applied the hierarchical penalty to all models tested here, including GC-Mixer, cMLP and cLSTM. However, the cLSTM only has an explicit dependence on one past timepoint, so it's not possible to apply the hierarchical penalty. Indeed, Tank et al discussed that penalty only in the context of the cMLP. Can the authors explain what they mean about using the hierarchical penalty with the cLSTM, because this sounds like a mistake.\n\n- The methods for splitting the time series to discover time-varying dynamics seems reasonable. However, the experiment that tests it seems quite simplistic, and I wonder if the authors could design an experiment that is either more challenging or more realistic. Also, I'm not certain about this, but it seems like the algorithm has no specific relationship with GC-Mixer: it is perhaps unfair to only use it with GC-Mixer in Table 4 and not apply it with cMLP or cLSTM?\n\n- The results with VAR data are encouraging, but this is not the type of data where GC-Mixer should be most valuable. Indeed, we would expect that traditional linear methods would perform far better with this data. On the Lorenz dataset that's actually nonlinear, GC-Mixer underperforms both cMLP and cLSTM.\n\n- The results in Figure 4 look like they did not involve tuning the penalty strength for cMLP. Can the authors describe what they did here and whether it's providing a fair comparison?\n\n- The final architecture is quite complicated, and I wonder if the authors performed any ablations to understand what aspects are important for it to work. For example, could they try with different numbers of blocks? Or removing batch normalization? Currently, it is hard to understand why this type of autoregressive model should enable better GC discovery than a MLP or LSTM - it's a different parameterization, but not obviously better. (And as mentioned above, the empirical results are not convincing on their own.)\n\n- Could the authors provide more details about how they generated AUROC curves? For example, did they keep epsilon fixed and train with different lambda values? Or did they train with one lambda value and sweep epsilon? It would be important to know whether there are any differences compared to previous methods.\n\n- For the title of Section 2.1.2, the \"non-autoregressive\" model looks like it actually is autoregressive, in that it predicts the future using the past. Perhaps what the authors meant to say is that it's nonlinear? This should be corrected.\n\n- Typo in Section 2.2.3: GULE -> GELU"
