Then, authors say, \u201cHowever, the right hand side of Inequality (3) should decrease gradually as both ${\\delta _{aug}}$ and ${\\delta _{{y^ - }}}$ increase, so the negative center similarity would be more likely to be lower.\u201c This is problematic because a smaller lower bound does not tell us whether the left side of equation 3 is smaller.\n2. The authors say, \"Initially, as the dropout rate increases, positive center similarity may decrease sometimes, but downstream performance could be enhanced as negative center similarity decreases much faster.\" This is problematic. From Figure 1, we can observe that, except for the second subgraph, the performance of the model is basically positively correlated with positive center similarity. The result of the second subgraph may be due to the randomness of the dataset selection, and I suggest that the authors give the average of the results of many different experiments.\n3. In Theorem 2.5, the related equation is a form of infimum. Then, the authors say, \"So better generalization correlates with worse positive center similarity.\" This is problematic because a smaller lower bound does not tell us whether the left side of the equation is smaller.\n4. From Theorem 2.5, I think we cannot determine why, as the augmentation becomes stronger, negative center similarity decreases while positive center similarity remains unpredictable.  First, when minimizing the NCE loss, the numerator is also changing. So, It's not reasonable to substitute $1 - {\\delta _{aug}}$ directly directly for $f{(v_i^1)^T}f(v_i^2)$. Second, even if the right-hand side of the related equation is equal to 0, that doesn't mean the left-hand side of the related equation is equal to 0. Because the right side of the related equation is the lower bound of the left.\n5. In Corollary 3.1, the related equation is also a form of infimum. So, even if the right-hand side of equation 4 is equal to 0, that doesn't mean the left-hand side of equation 4 is equal to 0. Because the right side of equation 4 is the lower bound of the left.\n6. The improvement in performance is negligible.\n7. My personal understanding of the two methods proposed in this paper is as follows: (1) From the perspective of information theory, the traditional GCL is based on learning, so that the mutual information between positive samples is as large as possible. This paper proposes that the mutual information between positive samples can be increased directly by data augmentation. (2) From the perspective of spectrum, the traditional GCL smoothen the spectrum through regularization, while this paper proposes that the mutual information between positive samples can be increased directly through data augmentation. Therefore, the motivation presented in this paper is not convincing."

Inspired by this relationship, the author proposes a simple method to find an appropriate amount of data augmentation on a dataset. \n\nIn section 2 of the paper, the authors propose that a strong data augmentation can help lower the negative center similarity, which will increase the intra-class divergence. However, it is hard to say that the positive center similarity will increase as expected. Therefore, the lower negative similarity helps more in contrastive learning.  It is crucial to find better augmentation to help the model better generalize on downstream tasks rather than find a perfect alignment. \n\nIn section 3 of the paper, the authors propose methods to find the amount of data augmentation from two inspectives. From an information perspective, inspired by the previous methods, the gradient can used to determine the importance of the node. The important nodes should be changed less than other nodes. And unimportance nodes are free to mask. From a graph spectrum perspective, the linear combination of eigenvalues of adjacency matrix q can be considered as a signal. If q decreases, the change in spectrum is too much."

But this is almost always expected regardless of theorem 2.5). This does not mean that pulling closer the augmentations is completely harmful, as there is potentially a sweet point between pulling closer inner class samples and pushing away inter class samples that is optimal to the optimization, which is also (intuitively) dependent on the dimension of the features. I guess maybe the conclusion can be made more interesting and more surprising if it addresses where that sweet point is (if perfect alignment is not the sweet point).  It is even better if this sweet point is connected to the value of the threshold $\\epsilon$. Currently, $\\epsilon $ seems to be a heuristic and is not associated with the positive negative balance problem.

                "value": "**W1.** Lack of related work. I note that you positioned the related work in the appendix. However, given that you mentioned other works (like Wang et al. 2022b, Saunshi et al. 2022) many times in the paper, an explicit and focused discussion on the differences between your work and others is expected.\n\n**W2.** Some definitions are unclear, resulting in harder understanding. For example, \n\n1) *augmentation overlap.* You give an intuitive explanation as \u201csupport overlap between different intra-class samples\u201d.  However, it is a specific term based on the analysis tool *augmentation graph*, first proposed by Wang et al 2022b. I think a formal definition is needed. The same is true for *perfect alignment*.\n\n2) $\\delta_{aug}$. I notice that it first occurs in Assumption 2.1 without any explanation. Considering it plays a key role in the following analysis, I think at least an intuitive explanation is needed here. Likelywise, the $\\omega_y$ in $L_{CE}$ and $M$ in $L_{NCE}$.\n\n**W3.** Lack of novelty for proposed augmentations. For the information-theory augmentation, it is quite similar with that proposed in Wei et al. 2023 (GCS). Similarly, the graph-spectrum augmentation is somewhat based on Liu et al. 2022 (GAME). However, both GCS and GAME are not chosen as a baseline in the experiments. As claimed, \u201cthis algorithm is primarily intended for theoretical verification\u201d, I think the contribution is more like explaining existing augmentations by theory. \n\n**W4.** I have a concern that label-consistency is more hard to guarantee on graphs (unlike images that can be judged manually). Therefore. it is difficult to figure out what kind of graph augmentations is strong enough while not perturbs the labels (i.e. satisfying the basis Assumption 2.1). Considering that, maybe experiments on images are more convincing."

                "value": "**Q1.** In Para3 of Introduction, you said \u201cBut it works the same in other fields.\u201d Given that $L_{NCE}$ and theorems in the paper are all based on graph nodes, I wonder if they can generate to other domains like images. It is worth mentioning that graph contrastive learning and vision contrastive learning can not be confused with each other, see [1].\n\n**Q2.** Questions about Figure 1.\n\n1) According to Theorem 2.3 and your statement \u201cTherefore, from Inequality (2), \u2026, to be lower.\u201d, it seems like the tendencies of positive and negative center similarity are different, but i did not see such phenomenon in Figure 1.\n\n2) The tendencies are not consistent across 4 datasets. For examples, accuracy tendencies on only 2/4 datasets (Cora, DBLP) are similar, i.e. increasing first and then decreasing. Considering the diversity of graph benchmarks, can you show more evidence on other benchmarks besides citation networks?\n\n3) More experimental details are needed, including the backbone, data splitting. Especially, no current GCL methods under widely-adopted settings can reach nearly 100% accuracy on these citation benchmarks, as far as I know.\n\n**Q3.** According to Corollary 3.1, you said \u201cthe best augmentation would be one that maximize the mutual information and positive pair difference\u201d. It seems to be contrary to the InfoMin principle [2], which claims that good views should minimize $I(v_1,v_2)$ while keep the label unchanged (i.e. $I(v_1,y)=I(v_2,y)=I(x,y)$). Can you give some explanations for the difference?\n\n**Q4.** Minors.  In section 2.3, \u201cTheorem 2.5 explains why as the augmentation becomes stronger, negative center similarity decreases\u201d. Maybe it should be Theorem 2.3.\n\n[1]. Guo et al. Architecture Matters: Uncovering Implicit Mechanisms in Graph Contrastive Learning. NeurIPS 2023.\n\n[2]. Tian el al.
