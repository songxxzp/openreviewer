                "value": "This paper proposes BCDP, a method for offline imitation learning with low-quality behavior data from which good policy cannot be directly extracted. The idea is simple: mimic expert on expert state, and reach expert state as frequently as possible when the agent is off the expert trajectory. Inspired by TD3+BC, BCDP designs an auxiliary reward that is 1 on expert state and 0 on non-expert state, and maximize a weighted sum of log likelihood on the expert dataset and auxiliary reward over the union of expert and non-expert dataset. On several testbeds with low-quality (e.g. random) auxiliary dataset, BCDP outperforms many offline imitation learning methods."

                "value": "**1. The reward design seems to be too strict.** Currently, judging from section 3.2, the reward for a state-action pair is 1 if and only if the state-action pair belongs to the expert dataset. However, with continuous state/action space and low quality auxiliary dataset, it is very likely that none of the state-action pairs in $D^O$ has a reward of 1 - and with pertubation in the continuous environment, it is even likely that every state appear in $D^O\\cup D^E$ is unique and no state in the auxiliary dataset $D^O$ lead to any reward. In such case, the optimization relies on the smoothing effect of the critic network. Thus, I suggest to add an ablation on replacing the current, identical reward with the discriminator used in prior work such as DWBC, ORIL or DemoDICE. \n\n**2. The hyperparameter is not specified, and some auxiliary plots are missing.** Currently, the value of some important hyperparameters are missing, e.g., weight for maximizing Q in the objective, network architecture, learning rate, number of steps to update, frequency of updating with policy gradient from critic. Also, the paper does not include learning curves. \n\n3. I encourage the authors to include discussion on the **limitation of the current work.**\n\n\n\nOther Minor errors:\n\n1.Typos:\n\na) in \"background and formulation\", \"... which is much cheap to obtain\" should be \"... which is much **cheaper** to obtain\";\n\nb) in the figure 2, \"How to achieve a expert-observed state\" should be \"How to achieve **an** expert-observed state\";\n\nc) in Algorithm 1, \"calcualte\" should be \"calculate\", \"datset\" should be \"dataset\";\n\nd) In the second line of section 4, \"relatuve\" should be \"relative\".\n\n2.

It might be hard to extract useful policy from low-quality behavior data, but those data could be useful for building up dynamic models, and thus help model-based methods.    \n\n2.

                "value": "* **Motivation:** While the paper aims to leverage low-quality data samples, its motivation for the same is unclear. Instead of highlighting the algorithmic design choices, authors focus on the split of datasets. This corresponds to implementing offline RL on only a subset of data samples. For instance, Section 1 and Figure 1 do not motivate the need for an expert-specific dataset split. Moreover, it is unclear as to what conclusions can be drawn from Figure 1. Authors should explain the task definition, complexity of task completion, number of trajectories, number of samples in each trajectory for the BC expert and the ratio of expert to non-expert data split.\n* **Practical Implementation:** While the work combines offline IL with DP, it leads to the well-established and pre-existing paradigm of offline RL. Practical implementation of BCDP presented in Section 3.2 is akin to applying offline RL on a different dataset split. As the authors note, BCDP is a special case of TD3+BC. However, its differences from TD3+BC or other offline RL algorithms remain unclear.\n* **Choice of Baselines:** While the authors state that their approach is similar to TD3+BC and offline RL, BCDP is not compared to these methods. Authors claim that \"they have selected TD3+BC as our most similar offline RL algorithm, which allows it to be considered as an ablation study for our approach\". However, an abaltion study of TD3+BC with BCDP is missing. It would be worthwile to compare BCDP with TD3+BC or a conservative algorithm such as CQL. This would help evaluate the utility of BCDP with established offline RL methods.\n* **OOD Evaluation:** The requirement and intuition behind DRG metric is unclear. From my understanding, DRG is a state occupancy measure based on agent's visitation towards particular states. Hence, it does not quantify the policy's performance at test time (as per Q3). A positive DRG does not indicate how the agent performed on unobserved states. It only indicates that the agent successfully evaded unobserved states. This leaves Q3 unanswered. In order to evaluate OOD performance, authors could use standard methods/metrics. For instance, BCDP could be evaluated on a set of heldout states or initialized in a new state (or random seed). Similarly, authors could measure the confidence of agent by assessing the probability of actions taken in unobserved states.\n* **Writing and Presentation:** In general, writing and presentation should be refined. Sentences and verbs could be made complete and grammatical errors could be reduced. Authors should also provide the missing ablations of TD3+BC and clearly explain what they wish to observe from Q3.\n\n### Minors\n* methods has achieved $\\rightarrow$ methods have achieved\n* data with uncertain $\\rightarrow$ data of uncertain\n* suboptimal polices $\\rightarrow$ suboptimal policies\n* which optimize the $\\rightarrow$ which optimizes the\n* learning provide a $\\rightarrow$ learning provides a\n* an action could $\\rightarrow$ an action that could\n* relatuve $\\rightarrow$ relative"

The authors propose a method that uses transition information from offline data to guide the policy towards states observed by experts, especially when reward signals are absent. They introduce an algorithm called Behavioral Cloning with Dynamic Programming (BCDP) that applies behavioral cloning to expert data and dynamic programming to unlabeled offline data.

Not only does the paper identify the challenge with low-quality auxiliary data, but it also offers a robust solution in the form of the BCDP algorithm. The empirical validation, where BCDP achieves state-of-the-art results on the D4RL benchmark across 14 tasks, attests to the method's efficacy and the overall quality of the research.\n\nThe paper lucidly articulates the challenges associated with offline imitation learning and the potential of low-quality data. The proposed BCDP algorithm is presented with clarity, making its methodology and implications easily understandable.\n\nThe research holds significant importance in the domain of imitation learning. By demonstrating that low-quality behavior data can be effectively leveraged, the paper breaks away from the traditional behavior quality assumption of auxiliary data, broadening the horizons of offline imitation learning. The potential extensions of BCDP, such as integrating it with model-based methods and addressing the existing imitation gap, highlight the paper's foundational contribution and its potential to pave the way for future advancements in the field."
