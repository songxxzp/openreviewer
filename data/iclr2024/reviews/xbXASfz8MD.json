Why is that? Is it related to the choice of the regularization? Can the model learn other symmetries in practice?

To do so the paper focuses on non-linear group actions and attempts to discover linear representations in a latent space of an autoencoder. The overall method is termed Latent LieGAN and comes with a theory that attempts to show that the learned symmetry group is actually valid. In practical tests, LaLiGAN was able to recognize the inherent symmetry in high-dimensional data, creating a structured space that can be used for other tasks. The paper also showcases how LaLiGAN can be used to enhance equation discovery and make long-term predictions for different dynamic systems."

Since then, there has been a large body of work studying automatic symmetry discovery with various results. This paper adds to this body of work by using an adversarial approach which is easy to follow in this context. Unfortunately, I have a negative view of the originality and significance of this work as I outline in the next section but I will say the paper is generally well presented and shows a high degree of polish. The experimental results are quite toy and concocted but they make for good visuals and suggest there is merit in this approach to low dimensional problems."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I have several concerns regarding this paper to the point I am confused and question the validity of the entire endeavor. These might be my misunderstanding so I hope they can be clarified in the rebuttal. But as it stands I cannot endorse this paper for the following reasons.\n\n1.) There is a strong emphasis on the non-linear group action aspect in this paper, but I believe this is a bit misguided. This is because the hallmark result of representation theory of Lie groups is that the Lie algebra connects the group to the vector space. Moreover, this can be described by matrices---hence linear representation---and you do not generally need non-linear representations. In practice, however, you can codify non-linear actions (e.g. rotations of 3D objects in a 2D image) and this is where you might want to learn a non-linear action. But I find the emphasis on the non-linear action exaggerated because LaLieGan learns a linear rep in the latent space anyways. I would suggest toning down these claims.\n\n2.) Prop 4.1 seems to not apply to the setup that the authors consider. This is because the encoder and decoder map to a latent space of an autoencoder. This means that the latent dimension can be **lower** than the observation dimension. As a result, $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ cannot ever be inverses---i.e. bijective---because the information is lost. Thus, I have strong doubts about the value of the proposition. Moreover, many symmetry discovery methods already assume an autoencoder setup. The main difference is that they do not take an adversarial approach so this limits the novelty of the method. Finally, the paper learns approximate inverses anyways so there is no reason to guarantee that the learned representation is an exact Lie group.\n\n3.) One of my biggest concerns is that the approach and results in this paper go against a relatively known result in Linear Symmetry Based Disentanglement by (Caselles-Dupr\u00e9 et. al 2019) who prove that symmetry discovery is impossible without interaction with the environment. This result is a symmetry-based analog to the result by Locatello et. al 2019. Thus I fear that the results in this paper are generally not true, and going beyond the toy datasets considered here might be impossible.\n\n4.) I am confused as to why the authors do not compare with more standard baselines for symmetry discovery. Granted these works often assume knowledge of the group apriori but why this is not the correct test bed? For example $SO(N)$ is done in Fig 2 and 4 of Quessard et al 2020 (you even cite this paper) as well as the main experiment of Caselles-Dupr\u00e9 et. al 2019. Moreover, there has been a lot of development in Deep Delay auto-encoders that extend SINDy. In particular Deep Delay Autoencoders Bakkarji et. al 2023 is an appropriate baseline for the non-linear dynamical system discovery experiments. I encourage the authors to include this baseline as well.\n\n**References**\n\nCaselles-Dupr\u00e9, Hugo, Michael Garcia Ortiz, and David Filliat. \"Symmetry-based disentangled representation learning requires interaction with environments.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 32 (2019).\n\nLocatello, Francesco, et al. \"Challenging common assumptions in the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations.\" international conference on machine learning.

How to choose the number of matrices L to be used in the method? I suppose the number of Lie algebra elements you parametrize will significantly affect the flexibility of the method in the latent space\n- If I understood correctly, the proposed method works for compact groups only. The experiments demonstrate that the method can learn trajectories that are isomorphic to circles. How will the method behave on the data which has translation symmetry only? Will it fail? If so, the set of admissible symmetries seems more limited and should be highlighted\n- in Proposition 4.1 you mention that $\\psi$ and $\\phi$ are inverse of each other. It is not correct, these functions are inverse to each other only on the input dataset. It raises the following question, how robust is the inverse property when you move away from the training dataset? How robust is the detected symmetry, when you move away from the training dataset?
