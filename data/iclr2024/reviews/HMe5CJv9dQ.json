They provide both theoretical and empirical results on their findings, and show that they improve on the state-of-the-art solutions for these problems.\n\nTheir algorithm for the $\\ell_1$ distance function involves reduction to a series of one-dimensional decompositions. They work with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) queries (for kernels, such as Gaussian, Exponential, and Cauchy), they use their new dimensionality reduction results that adapt the well-known JL matrices for their use-case. For the case of smooth kernels, they use functional approximation theory.\n\nSome of their experiments are performed on the CIFAR-10 dataset."

In particular, the authors consider f to be distance functions such as $\\ell_p$ for $p = 1, 2,\\ldots,$  and also Kernel density estimates such as gaussian, exponential and Cauchy kernels. The approximation obtained is $\\alpha$-relative and also has an additive factor.\n\nIn comparison to prior work, for the case where f is the $\\ell_p$ norm, the relative error produced in this paper seems higher (from a relative approximation standpoint) but lower in terms of the additive error. For the KDE queries, the errors are similar to before but the parameters d and \\alpha in the query time of this result are decoupled. Finally, at least some of the results in this paper seems relatively simple leading to an implementation."
