My major concern is the adaptive noise proposed in this paper does not produce worst-case DP guarantee: local sensitivity is not equivalent to the global sensitivity and that is why existing works need to do gradient clipping to ensure this bound. Though such clipping is artificial, it is the only known way to give the sensitivity bound of general DP-(decentralized) SGD. Therefore, all the experiments with comparisons to prior works are not fair. I can only take the empirical results as a technical report to study the distribution of practical gradient/local update norm.\n\n2. The theoretical results on both the convergence rate and the utility-privacy tradeoff seem weak, which do not provide too much new insights (largely the analysis of noisy decentralized SGD) and do not improve the prior results.\n\n3. In the experiments, only the relationship between loss/test accuracy and noise scale is plotted while the corresponding (epsilon, delta) guarantee is not mentioned. Even under such a weak privacy guarantee (not DP), the comparison with state-of-the-art deep learning results on CIFAR10 with DP-SGD is not provided."

In Figure 2(bcef), it empirically looks like smaller C is better. This leads to an interesting but missing comparison to infinitely small C, i.e. gradient normalization (clipping every gradient to the same value). See \"Automatic Clipping: Differentially Private Deep Learning Made Easier and Stronger\" for the centralized setting and \"DP-NormFedAvg: Normalizing Client Updates for Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning\" for the decentralized one. Would it outperform AdaD2P?\n\n3. The models and datasets are too toy-like. I would at least expect to see CIFAR100, which is of the same size as CIFAR10 but more difficult. It would be desirable to see also ResNet 34 or 50 (more compute, but managable by your machines), and ViT-tiny or small (similar compute as ResNet 18).
