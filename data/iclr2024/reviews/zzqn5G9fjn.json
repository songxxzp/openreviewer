There is no novelty, such as modification or adjustment to the method that may have give a better results. In other words, people with an objective to do federated learning for privacy purpose can easily come up with prompt tuning as a solution to reduce costs.\n- Though it may have implicitly inferred by the concept of FL, the paper did not mention why and how federated learning helps with privacy and in which case one should use FL for their application.\n- The purpose of the task of multilingual finetuning in this case, is not warranted use case of privacy preservation.\n- There is no reported evidence that privacy is actually preserved. Such as whether the final model memorize the local data.\n- There are better parameter-efficient finetuning methods, such as LORA/QLora, that the authors should conduct experiments on and do comparision with prompt tuning.\n- The results show prompt tuning are much worse than full-federated tuning, thus casting doubt if the cost-saving is worth it.\n- Other generative and knowledge-based tasks, such as QA, translations and summarizations should be performed.\n\n**I have read the author responses and I advocate for a strong reject, below are reasons:**\n\n* I mentioned the paper has fundamental problems with originality, novelty, where the paper uses an unrelated existing and non-novel method designed for a different problem (fed-learning) to solve a low-resource \"privacy\" problem that does not make sense or exist yet, in which the method itself much worse than standard training. \n* Instead of addressing the scientific issue, the authors distracted away by pressing that they are helping the low-resource communities, or improving inequality as a societal issue. These multiple responses are lengthy, wordy, unnecessary, and filled with many \"politically correct\" (I don't know better word) things to avoid the scientific issue. Agree that we should help those under-represented communities, but after reading these, I shouldn't feel like rejecting the paper is an action against those communities.\n* The problem of \"a low-resource community who wants to shut down their internet and border\" is unfounded. We train LLM on public data we can find. If they wants to protect their secret data, they can download a public pre-trained model and fine-tune on their own. \n* The real problem is how to improve low-resource with the limited data we have, which the paper fails to suggest a better solution than trivial.\n* Less communication doens't mean more privacy, because we transfer model weights, not the data. And less parameters doesn't mean less private information be leaked. This misconception leads to wrong approach.\n* The author claims to be the first to target the low-resource problem and many other things, but there have been many works in previous years about this. Please be careful with this kind of \"we are first\" statements.\n* Overall, none of the responses has helped resolve the issues stated in the review."
