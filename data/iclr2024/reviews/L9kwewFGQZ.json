Once the first one is solved, the problem can be treated as a Task-Incremental, as the predicted task-id is already available. The authors suggest using task-specific projections to condition the feature vector. This conditioned vector passes through a task-specific module: task prediction and feature importance. During inference, the output of each module is concatenated to obtain the prediction. The authors demonstrate good performance in both task and class incremental scenarios."

In fact, there is a probability that working the problem in this way helps the model lose generalization in the representations it generates, and the only reason why this does not happen in the proposed solution is that they use a buffer to store previous tasks.\n    - Even so it is a problem that is not widely attacked, but that can be a good option in many cases, especially if it's motivated by the idea of GWT.\n- The approach comprises many different components that have a good synergy between them.
