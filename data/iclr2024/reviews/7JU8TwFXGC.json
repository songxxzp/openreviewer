Hybrid Search Algorithm Accelerates Search Time: The Hybrid-Search algorithm (HS-NAS) presented in the paper demonstrates significant advantages in accelerating search time for Neural Architecture Search (NAS). It reduces search hours by approximately 50% and offers potential improvements in latency, GFLOPs, and model size. This can be a substantial advantage for practitioners looking to optimize their deep learning models.\n\n4.

The authors need to recognize the limitations when dealing with less conventional models, datasets, translation directions, metrics, and other tasks and discuss these in the paper. For instance:\n\n- What would occur if training and testing were done on WMT'22 data?\n- What if the testing were on a low-resource language, say, Wolof?\n- What would be the outcome when examining the results of COMET-22, or the recently released [COMET-kiwi-10B](https://huggingface.co/Unbabel/wmt23-cometkiwi-da-xxl) model, which GPT-4 lacks knowledge about?\n- What if the chosen model were the [CNN-based embedding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14280.pdf) for machine translation, where GPT-4 has limited familiarity?\n\nIt's very likely that GPT has already encountered the architecture selection and results for your model, data, and metric settings since they have been prevalent in recent years. It is very possible that the author is **testing the model that it had been trained on the test dataset**. However, the author didn't explicitly address the performance in less conventional settings in the paper, rendering the study meaningless."

                "value": "Overall, I am concerned that the paper is a bit too narrow in a few parts.\n\n**Comparison to other methods.** The authors use three baselines, all of which are supernetwork-based performance predictors. The authors also make the statement, \u201cThe SOTA approach for building performance predictors (f_T ) is to train a weight-sharing supernet model on the task T.\u201d It is highly unclear that this sentence is true. There are many different types of performance predictors, such as zero-cost proxies and learning curve extrapolation, each with different tradeoffs for runtime and accuracy. Furthermore, the performance of weight-sharing methods has been debated (e.g., the papers referenced here https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/07/17/in-defense-of-weight-sharing-for-nas/).\n\nI would have a better opinion of the experimental methodology if the authors compared to performance prediction methods beyond just supernetworks. Here are a few references:\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03064\n- https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/file/2130eb640e0a272898a51da41363542d-Paper.pdf\n- https://proceedings.mlr.press/v188/laube22a/laube22a.pdf\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08134\n\nI would especially point out that recently, the extremely simple baseline, \"number of parameters\" [has been found](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03064) to be a surprisingly strong baseline for performance prediction, so this would be great to add as a baseline e.g. in Table 1.\n\nOther than extending the set of baselines, I think the paper could be more impactful in other ways as well. For example, the authors only test their performance predictor on a single NAS framework; the one from HAT. There are other NAS frameworks too, for example, [Bayesian optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10423) or BOHB.\n\nFinally, the paper could also be more impactful if it tested search spaces / tasks beyond machine translation. For example, some of the above links use datasets based on computer vision, other NLP tasks, and speech recognition (like [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08134)).\n\nIt is surprising that LLM-Distill-PP performs better than LLM-PP. The authors give a few explanations. I think the paper would be stronger if the authors gave more insight and experiments into explaining this observation.\n\nThe authors mention that they share their code, but I couldn't find it. Can the authors share their code, e.g. with https://anonymous.4open.science/?"
