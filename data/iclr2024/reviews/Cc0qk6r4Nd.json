Defining these ideas earlier and more concisely would allow the reader to contextualize the problem domain and understand how the solution being proposed fits within its scope.\n- While the paper discusses the relationship between gradient similarity and performance/accuracy, and gradient similarity with smoother gradients, the key justifications for choosing to use smoother gradients are (a)  lack of a shared database, (b) Features would increase communication overheads, and (c) correlation between similarity of gradients and smoothness. Are there stronger correlations between the level of similarity (actual value) to the peak density or other statistics of the gradients?\n- There doesn't seem to be a an explicit definition of \"deep\" vs. \"shallow\" layers. Implicitly, within each stage there seem to be shallow and deep layers (Pg. 3, Cross-environment similarity). In general, there are certain experimental settings necessary to fully understand the figures plotted through the course of the manuscript that seem to be missing.\n- Given the specific model heterogeneity settings under which InCo Aggregation is applicable, a discussion on how and where it isn't applicable (e.g., Complete model heterogeneity, where models are restricted to be within the same family of backbones) would be useful."

Drawing a parallels to behavior across Stages would be helpful in establishing the consistency of the observations on smoother gradients and how they relate to similarity values.\n- Could the authors provide an explicit definition of which layers can be considered deep vs.shallow? If the nomenclature implicitly defined in \"Cross-environment Similarity\" is to be maintained, could the authors provide an explanation of whether this pattern carries over to ViTs as well?\n- Could the authors discuss further about similarity patterns in ViT's and how this impact the observations and InCo aggregation as a whole?\n- Could the authors provide more detail explanations for the exact setups used to generate Fig. 1, 2, and 3?\n- Could the authors provide more insight into how Fig. 3 would vary when tested across multiple trials? This could help remove the uncertainty caused by SGD noise.\n- Could the authors provide the standard deviation values for InCo-based methods?\n- Given the variation in performances in Table 3 and the original values cited under FedROLEX, ScaleFL, etc., could the authors provide a detailed breakdown of how the experimental settings differ from the original works?\n- A discussion on how and where it isn't applicable (e.g., Complete model heterogeneity, where models are restricted to be within the same family of backbones or in cases where weight matrices do no align) is critical to understand and apply the proposed method."
