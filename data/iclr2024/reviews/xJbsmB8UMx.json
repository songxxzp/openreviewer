The current prevailing method for LLM alignment is Reinforcement Learning with Human Preferences (RLHF), and it mainly consists of three phases: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on human demonstration data, (2) reward mode (RM) training on human preference data, and (3) RL fine-tuning with human-guided RM. Unlike RLHF, SALMON consists of (1) few-shot in-context learning (ICL), (2) RM training on AI preference data, and (3) RL fine-tuning with AI-guided RM. Since SALMON is based on RLAIF, it can be more efficient and scalable than RLHF. More specifically, SALMON based on Llama-2-70B only uses 6 demonstration annotations and zero preference annotations to achieve 7.4 MT-Bench score. In contrast, Llama-2-Chat based on SFT and RLHF uses about 27K demonstration annotations and about 1.4M preference annotations to achieve 6.9 MT-Bench."

But, the system laid down is distinct enough to warrant interest from the community.\n\n- The paper claims that using principles to avoid reward hacking. Perhaps, the work \u201creward hacking\u201d is a bit overloaded, but I don\u2019t see any reason that SALMON rewards cannot be hacked to give degenerative responses or undesirable responses, if trained long enough using RL.\n\n- What I do not completely understand is why train a separate reward model at all? The SFT-Model acting as a judge can already be used as a reward model. The scores for SFT-model can be aggregated for many principles as well (it might require multiple passes, but they can be batched potentially).\n\nOverall, it seems that the final reward model ends up using several \u201chacks\u201d which somewhat go against the main message of the paper:\n- The reward model training claims to bypass human preference collection, but ends up pre-training on Anthropic HH-RLHF and SHP preference. Importantly, HH-RLHF and SHP contribute ~320k preference pairs to pre-training, while the SALMON reward uses only ~9.8k prompts (unclear how many preference pairs that yields, given that it can be combined with a large number of principles). How well does SALMON do without without the Preference Model Pre-training?\n- Prior works deem the tendency of RLHF to produce lengthier responses as a negative. It is somewhat unfortunate that such a length bonus needs to be explicitly included as a symbolic reward. Can you also elaborate how this reward is included?\n\nWhile I appreciate the performance of Dromedary-2-70b, the paper lacks several experiments and ablations that give more insight into why the method works. Some quantitative experiments that show how well the SFT model labels the preference in accordance to the principle are severely needed, and ablations of training the model without the \u201chacks\u201d, and only with the \u201chacks\u201d would show the importance of SALMON technique."

What is the size of the final preference dataset that is generated by the Self-aligned SFT model?\n- Moreover, since the preference is computed based on the difference between logprobs, it would make sense to look at log probability of semantically equivalent answers [1]. The highest log probability can be misleading by itself.\n- Why is the preference label decided by the principle with the most pronounced difference? Why not use the sum of scores, for example?\n- Can you quantitatively evaluate the preferences generated by the SFT-Model, especially conditioned on the principles? How sensitive is the SFT model to the principle? For example, does using the negative principle flip the preference?\n- How does the model perform when using just the SALMON reward without the symbolic bonuses, especially without the length bonus?\n- A discussion on more recent works on alignment from scratch can be added such DPO, ReST SliC-HF etc\n\n[1] Surface Form Competition: Why the Highest Probability Answer Isn't Always Right.
