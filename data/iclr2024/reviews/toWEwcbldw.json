Similarly, the argument that CL techniques are superior to naively retraining (i.e., fine-tuning) is not crucial. In current methods, fine-tuning already involves weighted adjustments, even exclusively on the head. Equation 17 oversimplifies the problem.\n3. Continual learning typically involves multiple rounds of weight updates, but in this article, it is only divided into two categories: head and tail classes. Would better performance be achieved by designing more categories or exploring techniques that require only an additional training round?\n4. The article lacks an ablation study. For example, how does the proportion of divisions affect the results? What performance can be achieved with more categories, as suggested in W3? These aspects are worth exploring."

The proofs do not address the most critical issues, hence the given rating. I am unsure if this rating is overly strict, and I will also consider the opinions of other reviewers to adjust my score. Overall, I believe this perspective is worth exploring, but when theory cannot cover everything, conducting more experiments or proposing a new design approach may be a better endeavor."

Typically, this is considered an upper bound in continual learning. For me, it is not clear why not to exploit this possibility. And within that setup, it is not so clear what anti-fogetting mechanisms would be needed. \n\n- I would have preferred a bit more analysis where the authors zoom in on particular methods and change the amount of anti-forgetting (continual learning techniques) that are applied. For example, for EWC one can change the lambda parameter and more from FT (full plasticity) to a very high lambda (max. stability); showing the accuracy as a function of the lambda would be very insightful. And for me, more convincing that CL methods could be a tool to improve LTR. (the same holds for other methods, like LwF).\n\n- In general, backward transfer is not common in CL. I am somewhat surprised about the results in Figure 4. Normally, backward and forward transfer are defined for task-aware incremental learning (TIL). I understand here that the results are class-incremental (CIL). How are forward and backward transfer computed ?"
