The proposed method, GeneOH Diffusion, uses a novel approach that includes a contact-centric HOI representation named GeneOH and a new domain-generalizable denoising scheme. The contact-centric representation GeneOH parameterizes the HOI process, facilitating enhanced generalization across various HOI scenarios. The new denoising scheme consists of a canonical denoising model trained to project noisy data samples from a whitened noise space to a clean data manifold and a denoising via diffusion. The experiments on four benchmarks show the superior effectiveness of the proposed method."

The experiments show that the method outperforms others in various tests, suggesting its potential for a wide range of applications."

However, the majority of the experiments focus on adding known distribution noise to clean ground truth (GT) data and subsequently denoising it. This approach falls short in adequately analyzing the distinction between noise in real hand-object interaction trajectories and artificial noise, as well as evaluating the model's performance in real-world \"in-the-wild\" scenarios."

However, there is a significant degradation observed in HO Motion Consistency. The reviewer requests an explanation from the authors regarding this phenomenon.\n- Please consider citing: \"H2O: Two Hands Manipulating Objects for First Person Interaction Recognition\" in ICCV2021."
