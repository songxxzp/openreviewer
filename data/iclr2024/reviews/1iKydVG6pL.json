                "value": "The formatting of the submission makes it hard to read. There is not sufficient space between the paragraphs. There is clearly content that can be cut from the submission to make it easier to read. For example, the four phases of MCTS do not need to be enumerated in the introduction.\n\nThe structure and contextualization of the submission is poor. The submission is essentially applying AlphaZero to a new setting with problem-specific tweaks. However, the submission is written as if the AlphaZero methodology is largely original to the submission: AlphaGo Zero is cited one time for the definition of a running action value and AlphaZero is not cited at all. This lack of proper attribution is alone enough to disqualify the submission from acceptance. The appropriate way to structure the submission would be to include AlphaZero in a background section and describe problem specific tweaks in a methodology section.\n\nThere are also some strange deviations from AlphaZero that make me skeptical of whether the results should be taken seriously. For example, in equation (4), the submission seems to suggest that it uses the normalized logarithm of the visit counts as the policy (though it gives contradictory information elsewhere in the submission). If it is true that the submission is using the logarithm of the visit counts, it ought to better justify this modification (though I am skeptical that a justification exists). Also, it adds an entropy penalty to the loss function that is not typically present. The submission does ablations which seem to suggest that this entropy penalty is helpful. But these lead me to wonder whether this penalty is only necessary because of other unusual choices made by the submission. Overall, it is certainly possible that the submission's deviations from AlphaZero are necessary to achieve good performance, but the submission's poor presentation leaves the reader with the feeling that these deviations are haphazard rather than the product of careful study."
