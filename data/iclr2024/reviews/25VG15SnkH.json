                "value": "Authors propose a self-supervised pre-training method for time-series data encompassing various domains and temporal dynamics and show that it leads to significant performance gains for finetuning on small datasets. The problem is well-motivated as time-series occurs in domains such as traffic, weather, finance, etc and in many cases labelled data is limited.\n\nGiven a time-series $x \\in R^T$ authors propose to encode it as a sequence $z \\in R^{K \\times d}$ via a simple convnet. For this, authors collect various labelled and unlabelled time-series datasets (>75) and pretrain on all of them. Pretraining consists of various objectives from prior works and some novel components. At a high level, the encoder is trained to predict $z_K$ from the context $z[<K]$. During finetuning $z_K$ is used to classify $x$. For better generalization, during pretrianing, a different time-series $y$ is chosen from the batch and a convex combination $\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda)y$ is used for learning a continuous latent space between samples from various datasets. Training losses are designed to learn representations that are robust to augmentations such as magnitude scaling, permutation and jitter.\n\nAuthors demonstrate the utility of the method on a large collection of timeseries datasets over various modalities."

In Table 1 the experiments are performed on a limited number of datasets and data, and it seems that including the SICC loss helps. In contrast, Table 2 and Figure 6 suggets that finetuning on all available data, excluding the SICC loss (essentially resulting in the TS-TCC model from prior work) doesnt hurt the performance significantly.\n\n3. The TS-TCC framework is itself not intuitive to begin with - what exactly is the need for such data augmentations and contrived losses derived from these? Why to only use the last vector $z_K$ to be predicted from context $c$ - why not predict $z_t$ from $z_{t-1}$ for every $t$? How is $c$ formed? Not clear if this pipeline cannot be replaced with a much simpler training pipeline assuming more data is available."

Could the authors experimentally demonstrate why it is infeasible to use TS-TCC (and TF-C) for pre-training on multiple datasets?\n2. **Experimentation:** I like how the authors have structure their experimentation in terms of research questions. However, I feel that the results are not convincing due to several reasons: (1) Multiple baselines including recent works such as TS2Vec [1], older techniques such as T-Loss [2] and TST [3], and statistical methods such as Dynamic Time Warping-based Nearest Neighbors (see [1]) were missing. (2) The experiment framework differs from some prior work, where the representations are used to train a downstream classifier such as SVM for classification (see [1] and [2] for example). I wonder whether, how and why is the fine-tuning and subsequent evaluation different from that of prior work, including the metrics used to compare the methods (i.e. accuracy). Also see section on Clarity below. (3) The ablation results in Table 2 seem insignificant since the variances of the models are overlapping. I would be interested in seeing a critical difference diagram to see if the differences between the proposed method and ablations are indeed significant. \n3. **Clarity:** Some important details in experimentation were missing, for example, how were the models fine-tuned? I see from the appendix that cross-entropy loss was used, but it is unclear what was the structure of the model. \n\nReferences:\n[1] Yue, Zhihan, et al. \"Ts2vec: Towards universal representation of time series.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
