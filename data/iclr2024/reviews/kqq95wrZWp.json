There are numerous aspects of the experiments that should be reviewed:\na) The proposed method can achieve superior performance in FID but PSNR results seem to be not good. For colourization tasks, I think the FID value can represent some critical factors of image quality, while for SR and deblurring, the PSNR and LPIPS (measured on each sample) might be more convincing.\nb) Some GAN/Diffusion-based zero-shot restoration methods should be also compared:\n[1] Xingang Pan, Xiaohang Zhan, Bo Dai, Dahua Lin, Chen Change Loy, and Ping Luo. \"Exploiting Deep Generative Prior for Versatile Image Restoration and Manipulation,\" ECCV, 2020.\n[2] Fei, Ben, Zhaoyang Lyu, Liang Pan, Junzhe Zhang, Weidong Yang, Tian-jian Luo, Bo Zhang, and Bo Dai, \"Generative Diffusion Prior for Unified Image Restoration and Enhancement,\" CVPR, 2023.\n\n2. For the visual result comparisons, it is hard to say which method is better. For example, in Fig. 4, for the dog case, DPS's result is obviously much superior to the proposed one.\n\n3. SSD relies on an accurate estimation of degraded operators. For example, \"due to SSD relies on an accurate estimation of degraded operators\" should be \"due to SSD's reliance relies on an accurate estimation of degraded operators."

The paper is overall well written but some of its confusion math notations made it even harder for me to assess the technical correctness.\n\n- I did not really understand the reason behind Eq. 10. Did this come from a prior work ? Why a $\\beta_{t+1}$ appeared suddenly ? There is virtually no explanation (conceptual or mathematical) around Eq.10. Authors said \u201cwe can define a similar form ..\u201d which is not a very solid reasoning.\n- Even though there is no reference to supplementary, but it seems the relevant part of the explanation for Eq.10 is in appendix C. The derivation and reasoning in app.C is also questionable. What I could understand from app.C is that the authors derived Eq.33 from the **forward process** and tried to conclude the DA inversion equation (Eq. 10) should look similar. Is this even theoretically reasonable ?\n- It seems to me that the authors are trying to compare with noise $\\epsilon$ with noise-estimate $\\epsilon_{\\theta^*}(x_t, t)$, which is not sometimes one can do. A trained model $\\epsilon_{\\theta^*}$ can have very different statistics than $\\mathcal{N}(0, I)$. Do the authors agree ?\n\nNotations issues:\n\n- 3rd paragraph of intro: Can you please properly define $z$ before using it ? Generally in inverse problems, posterior is shown as $p(x|y)$ and it is confusing what $z$ is and how to interpret it. If $z$ is just prior (i.e. $\\mathcal{N}(0, I)$), then the notation $p(z|y)$ looks very strange !\n- Just after Eq. 1, write discrete sequences as $[x_t]\\_{t=0}^T$ and not ${x_t}_{t=0}^T$. Same for $\\beta_t$.\n- The notation $\\epsilon$ and $\\bar\\epsilon$ are very confusing. I am not sure what means whats. Sometimes they are defined as just gaussian noise (also same as $\\epsilon$), sometimes as \u201cnoise added until ..\u201d. (this definition only appears in supplementary). What exactly does that mean ? It is never mathematically defined or explained.\n- Eq. 10 and Eq. 12: $z$ has two different definition. Where did $(\\mu, \\sigma)$ come from in Eq. 12 ?\n- No definition for $H^{\\dagger}$ where it\u2019s first defined."
