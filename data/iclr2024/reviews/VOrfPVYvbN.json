In each iteration, they generate images based on the text embedding of one node and then utilize CLIP Interrogator to remap images into textual descriptions. The description with the highest relevance is selected. The authors conducted multiple experiments to demonstrate that their method could generate more detailed descriptions."

This would help elevate it beyond its current format, which resembles a technical report. For example, Sec 4.1.2 could have been made as an algorithmic procedure. \n\n- The effectiveness of the proposed method doesn't seem entirely convincing. Tables 1 and 2 show only marginal improvements over the original class labels, with some cases being identical. The evaluation could benefit from additional qualitative results to provide a more comprehensive assessment. Furthermore, it's unclear how the corpus baselines are implemented, and proper citation and referencing would be helpful in this regard.\n\n- In Sec 6.3, the concept of model cloning is introduced without proper context. If the purpose of model cloning is to create a generative process that replicates the original dataset, the evaluation in Table 3 appears insufficient, as it only measures generation quality but not diversity. Metrics for distribution shift should be included, and the choice of the four scenarios should also be justified (e.g., it's unclear how scenario 1 serves in evaluating the proposed method).\n\n- Table 4 indicates that the proposed method exhibits a strong bias in generating correlated attributes that are unrelated to the source labels. While the use of the proposed method to uncover implicit bias in target models is intriguing, it appears independent of the problem the method aims to address, and Table 4 does not seem to provide conclusive evidence to support this claim."
