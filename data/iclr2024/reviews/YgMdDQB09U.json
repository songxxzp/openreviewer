At first, the authors point out the limitations of existing NT-Xent objectives (i.e., performance is heavily influenced by batch size). Then, the authors theoretically analyze why SimCLR loss is sensitive to batch size from the gradient perspective. Finally, the author provides the theoretical analysis to demonstrate the convergence guarantee of AUC-CL. Although the relative performance is significant, the absolute accuracy is not competitive. Besides, the reasons why AUC-CL is batch-size robust are not clear, which seems to be an important property."

Some of them have better performance than the contrastive learning methods. Although this paper focuses on improving contrastive representation learning, it is still necessary to compare with non-contrastive representation learning methods. \n\n- Some contrastive learning methods which do not need negative samples, e.g. BYOL and DINO, also shows some robustness to batch size. I think it is necessary to list their performance with smaller batch size (e.g., 256, the same as the proposed method) in Table 1.\n\n- Why does the paper use ViT-S on ImageNet in the experiment? As far as I aware, most of the representation learning methods use ViT-B or ViT-L for ImageNet evaluation. Also, do all methods converge at 400 epochs for ResNet-50 and 300 epochs for ViT-S? If the baseline methods can reach the same performance as the proposed method with longer epochs and larger architecture, then I don't think the paper can claim the outperformance over them.\n\n[1] He et al.

Could you explain why there appears to be a conflict between these two results?\n\n3. As shown in Figure 3, the accuracy advantage of the proposed method gradually disappear as training proceeds, so it actually just converges faster at early training stage.
