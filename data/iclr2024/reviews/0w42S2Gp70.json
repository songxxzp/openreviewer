One of the important shortcomings of neural Networks is their vulnerability to adversarial examples.\nThus it makes sense to design adversarially robust nn-based perceptual metrics. They show that the DreamSim metric is not robust to adversarial examples. They then propose a robust perceptual\nsimilarity metric called LipSim (Lipschitz Similarity Metric) with provable guarantees."

Can you compare your method agains some of those m\nMetrics? Is DISTS in Fig. 3.a NN-based?\n\nQ: Other datasets than Nights dataset? What is the guarantee that these results will also generalize to other datasets?\n\n\nQ: In 5.1, you are stating \u201cCan adversarial attacks against SOTA metrics cause: (1) misalignment with human perception?\u201d. \nIn section 4.1, you mention \u201cQ: Please mention why we need robust perceptual metrics??!!! In real world. In other words, how much impact such work has in real world and why it actually matters? An example may help here. Alternatively, shouldn\u2019t two image differ significantly when perturbation is high? Have you considered what happens at high perturbations?\nShouldn\u2019t a good perceptual metric match human judgements regardless of perturbation magnitude?\n\n\nQ: Table 2 shows the certified scores. However, the scores for perturbation 72/255 and beyond are still pretty low. How do humans behave in those perturbations?"

A 1-Lipschitz function can bound a network's output to prevent it from changing excessively in response to slight input changes. Another key focus is the DreamSim perceptual distance metric, which utilizes cosine distance on combined feature vectors derived from various representation learning techniques. Furthermore, a new metric, LipSim, is introduced, aiming to be robust against adversarial disturbances. LipSim's design employs a two-step training process that first uses DreamSim as a guiding model on the ImageNet dataset, followed by fine-tuning on the NIGHT dataset to enhance its robustness."

This dual proficiency ensures that the metric's performance is not only observed in experimental conditions but also certified under specific robustness criteria."
