They also derive the asymptotic Bayesian optimal error. These results are both expressed as a function of low-dimensional quantities.

The authors could have addressed the issue of estimation.\n\n3- The results derived by the authors seem non-rigorous, although several attempts in the literature have made them fairly rigorous. It would be interesting to discuss the reasons why it is not possible to derive rigorous results and, above all, to explain why it is not possible to derive rigorous results.

However, in the definition of the model there is more mention of contamination on the covariates, which obviously indirectly induces contamination on the responses. But written this way, we would expect additional contamination on the regression noise.\n\n2- Given the complexity of the expressions, it is important to simplify the notations as much as possible and to avoid defining unnecessary quantities and also to clearly define those which are used. Unless I'm mistaken, this is not always the case. For example in the result 2.4,  $\\xi \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I_d)$ and $z$ seem to be defined but never used. Likewise, the integration variables $\\eta$ and $\\tau$ are not properly defined. The notation $\\partial_w$ and $\\partial_\\mu$ are not clear since we do not know what $w$ and $\\mu$ refer to.\n\n3- The results depend on the real parameter $\\beta_\\star$, which limits the application of the bound on real data. Can the authors comment on when to estimate asymptotic performance to carry out, for example, model selection, ...\n\n\n4- Section 4 could have been reorganized differently to provide more detailed explanation and experiments. In substance the result is, with the exception of one or two notations, the same as that of the main result. It is therefore in my opinion unnecessary to present it again. It can be put in an appendix by highlighting in the main paper what are the differences with the main result and deriving the main complementary intuitions.\n\n5- The lack of rigor of the results still remains one of the weaknesses but it is very little discussed. What else prevents you from having rigorous results? What are the blocking passages?\n\nAfter rebuttal, I read the answer of the authors. The authors promise to enhance the readability of the paper by providing notations section, by illustrating and discussion specific particular cases. I think this will allow to reach a wider audience. But I still think there are more to do in this sense. I will advise authors to progressively help the reader to grasp all the cumbersome notation by explaining before the theorem each main variables and giving intuitive explanation. How they behave in the asymptotic case (p fixed and n large)? What are the effects of the large dimensional corrections, and to particularly discuss notations that are specific to the heavy tailed analysis and that don't appear in the non heavy tailed analysis by raising some limiting cases. I think the problem of estimation of the signal to noise ratio limits the practical application of the paper and even though the authors claim it s a standard problem for regression problem, I think it is important to make the nice theoretical analysis practical even by providing some guidelines from the theory or from the analysis."

                "value": "1) I couldn't fully understand Result 2.4, I think this is too abstract. Result 2.5. is clear, but I couldn't understand what you get if you use Huber loss for $\\eta_i$ with infinite variance. Could you say what happens in this case? (You can use the same distribution of $\\eta_i$ that you used for experiments, or any other meaningful distribution with infinite variance, I just want to understand the result and compare it with 2.5). I'm also fine with a simplified answer that is not very precise and ignores a factor bounded by a universal constant.\n\nI also suggest you to explicitly write a separate general result for unbounded variance noise (and Huber loss) somewhere in the main part of the paper (again, maybe simplifying the formulas and making the bounds worse by a constant factor). To do this, you should fix some general property of $\\eta$. As you observed at the end of page 19, one may assume wlog that the symmetry assumption (Assumption B.2) is satisfied in this case. In addition, I think you need to fix the scale of the noise. For this you may use some assumptions from prior works, e.g. the classical assumption from [Pol91] that $\\eta$ has some positive density at zero. Or perhaps you already used something similar somewhere in the paper but I missed it? \n\n2) I think some discussion related to Result 2.5 and the state of the art would be good to add. In particular, if you normalize $X$ so that $X^\\top X = I$ and then do ridge regression, then the parameter error is well-known, and then you can go back to the old basis by dividing the error by the smallest singular value of $X^\\top X$. Can you compare this simple approach with your result, is your result strictly better?\n\n3) Does the following simple approach provide results comparable to yours: First we use half of the covariates to learn the median norm of $x_i$, and then we only take samples from the second half that are less than this median norm. Then the covariates should be not so bad and it might be possible to use known results for squared or Huber loss. Is it strictly worse than your result? It would be good to add a comparison to the paper.\n\n4) What do you mean by \"non-rigorous\" when you discuss Results 2.4 and 2.6 on page 5? \n\nLess important:\n\n5) For the unbounded variance noise (e.g. the one that you consider in the experiments, or, again, any other meaningful noise), does the ($\\ell_2$-penalized) LAD estimator have similar guarantees as Huber loss, or are they asymptotically different here?\n\n[Pol91] David Pollard, Asymptotics for least absolute deviation regression estimators, Econometric Theory 1991"
