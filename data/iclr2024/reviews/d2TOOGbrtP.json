But if it is the case, by variational inference, \\theta is a function of $\\omega$ determined by the model (e.g., a neural network); then, how to understand $q(\\omega|\\theta_i)$.

What constitutes the samples of the posterior after the training of the Bayesian neural net converges\u2014model parameters, latent features, or something else entirely? Furthermore, clarity is needed on the dimensionality of the samples from the proposed posterior.\n\n2. There is no need to present p(w|D^{c}) = E_{p(D^{v})}(p(w|D^{c}, D^{v})) as a theorem; it is a standard statistical technique known as marginalization. Routine operations in statistics, like this, do not necessitate proof.\n\n3. I could not identify any specific contributions made by the authors in this paper. It reads more like a review of Bayesian methods in domain generalization. The claimed theorem appears to be about the marginalization of conditional distributions. I am interested in the authors' elaboration on this during the rebuttal.\n\n4. I'm sensing a concern about the assumption that \\mathcal{D}_{c} \u200b remains constant across the entire dataset \\mathcal{D}, especially given the notation \\mathcal{D}_{i}^{N} \u200b mentioned by the authors. It seems the authors are questioning whether there can be a subset of data within one dataset that is fully domain-specific or domain-invariant, as opposed to only certain features (latent encoded outputs) being domain-invariant. Consequently, I find the motivation behind the proposed work to be lacking. Let us break it down. The authors seem to suggest that \\mathcal{D}_{c} remains consistent throughout \\mathcal{D}, where \\mathcal{D}_{i}^{N} \u200b represents subsets of data within the dataset. The authors point out that there is a subset of samples that are domain-specific or invariant rather than there is part of feature elements within entire data samples that are domain-specific or invariant (e.g., In the conventional understanding, we acknowledge that images of dogs often exhibit diverse background information, which can be seen as domain-specific. Simultaneously, the outlines or features of dogs themselves are considered domain-invariant. However, the authors introduce the idea that within the broader category of dogs, there should be a subset of images that are specifically tied to a domain or completely domain-invariant. This assertion does not seem to align with the typical variability observed in dog images, and I find it challenging to envision such a subset existing within this category). This leads to a potential misalignment in the assumption. If the proposed work relies on the idea that certain data samples are entirely domain-specific within a dataset, it might not be well-grounded. It might be more accurate to frame the motivation around features being domain-invariant rather than assuming entire data samples share this characteristic. In essence, it appears there's room for clarification or adjustment in the assumption to better reflect the reality of domain invariance within datasets. This refinement would strengthen the motivation behind the proposed approach.\n\n5. The literature compared in this study appears to be somewhat outdated, with the highlighted method, SOTA CORAL, dating back to 2017. Given that the proposed method relies on an existing domain generalization (DG) method for initialization, it becomes crucial to benchmark against more recent approaches. It would be particularly insightful to demonstrate how the proposed method not only aligns with but also enhances the state-of-the-art frameworks in domain generalization. Please consider conducting comparisons with the latest methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of your proposed approach in the context of contemporary DG frameworks.\n\n## Minors:\n\n1. The authors should perform an ablation study to assess the performance of the proposed PTG without relying on other domain generalization (DG) methods for initialization. For instance, evaluating PTG using only the pre-trained ResNet-18 as the initialization for model training on each domain would provide insights into its standalone effectiveness.\n\n2. Correct the grammatical errors, for example, on page 4, section 3.2, the proof should be \"shown\" instead of \"show.\"\n\n### Reference\n\n[1] Zhang, X., He, Y., Xu, R., Yu, H., Shen, Z. and Cui, P., 2023.

                "value": "1. The authors in section 3.3 suggest initializing the BNN on each domain with a uniformly well-generalized model, such as a BNN trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). The confusion arises regarding the connection between initializing the model on each domain and selecting the best model through ERM. To clarify, the authors advocate training a BNN using ERM on a specific dataset before initializing it on different domains. The dataset used for this ERM training is not explicitly mentioned in this section, but it is the dataset that provides the well-generalized model used as the starting point for initialization across various domains. In essence, the ERM-trained BNN serves as a kind of starting point. It is trained on a particular dataset that captures general patterns. My understanding is that this well-generalized model is then employed as the initial configuration for the BNN when dealing with different domains. The emphasis is on using a model that has already demonstrated good generalization capabilities through ERM, ensuring a solid starting point for adaptation to diverse domains.\n\n2. The terminologies used in the paper are confusing. In the introduction, the authors equate domain-invariant features to domain-invariant parameters. In typical deep-learning contexts, parameters refer to learnable model weights and biases, while features denote the encoder's output. To prevent potential misinterpretations, it would be helpful if the authors could offer clear definitions for parameters and features within the scope of their work.\n\n3. Could you provide clarity on the definition of the prior model in the proposed work? Is it initialized from the pretraining of ResNet, or is it initialized from the pretraining of another domain generalization (DG) method? Please elaborate on this aspect.\n\n4. Could you specify the space in which domain-invariant and domain-specific information is defined? Is it in the input space, latent space, or output probability space? If it's in the input space, how does \\mathcal{D} change? If it's in the latent and output spaces, how does p(\\mathcal{D}^{c}) remain constant? Clarification on this aspect would enhance understanding.\n\n5. In Algorithm 1, when the authors mention updating the model parameters with a Gaussian distribution, are they referring to sampling the model parameters from the Gaussian distribution outlined in Equation (4)? If so, could you provide clarification on the method used for this sampling process? Is it achieved through random sampling? Please provide additional details.\n\n6. In Figure 2, the authors mention extracting domain-invariant information from domain-specific features (Z^V). Given that these features reside in the encoded space (the output space of ResNet-18) if the training of ResNet-18 is indeed effective in extracting domain-invariant features, it raises a question: How can domain-invariant information also be present within features specifically identified as domain-specific? The term \"information\" is used without a clear definition from the authors. This ambiguity, coupled with an unclear definition of \\mathcal{D}, restricts readers from fully grasping the paper's content. Could the authors provide more clarity on interpreting \"information\" and a more explicit definition of \\mathcal{D}? My understanding is that the authors are trying to claim that the feature map might not effectively capture the domain-invariant information from the data. If my understanding is correct, then the claim is very ambiguous. The authors should at least provide some ways to quantify or visualize it. In the current version of the paper, this claim is not supported theoretically or empirically."

Therefore, the authors propose some ad-hoc solutions in Section 3.3 such as neural networks for different domains should be initialized from the same point, the parameters of the last layer should be shared between neural networks, and the learning rate should be carefully decayed. These solutions are not well-motivated and do not guarantee that the posteriors of parameters are well-aligned and aggregated properly.\n- The authors propose PTG-Lite, which is a lite version of the main method. Due to the difficulty of employing Bayesian treatment to the neural network\u2019s parameters, PTG-Lite just uses maximum-a-posteriori MAP solutions. We can see from Table 1 that PTG-Lite performs comparably with PTG. This somehow downgrades the main narrative of the paper which is to propose a Bayesian framework for aggregating posteriors on domains and inferring domain invariant posteriors.\n- One of the main contributions is the Theorem 3.1. However, it is trivial. Although the authors claim in the abstract that this theorem relies on relaxed assumptions. However, the assumption of full independence between the domain invariant and domain-specific information is quite strong.\n- The authors should experimentally compare with other approaches using Bayesian neural networks such as Xiao et al. (2021) and follow-up works.\n- The writing should be improved. There are some citation and grammar typos and sentences that need further clarification. For example, in the second row from the bottom of page 3, what are the parameters?\n\nReferences\n\nXiao et al. A Bit More Bayesian: Domain-Invariant Learning with Uncertainty. ICML 2021."
