Shouldn\u2019t fig1 show starting from single x, fanning out, and reducing all mask down to single y?\n- What does t ~ U(0,\u2026,T-1) mean in eq 7? Seems very odd\u2026 Why doesn\u2019t it go to the end T? Why do we have multiple values?\n- What happens to the last timestep in eq 7? This seems to be a Dirac, which probably poses problems.

How do you evaluate the final prediction z_T?\n- What is p(z|x,y)?\n- What is p(z_t+1 |\u00a0z_0, z_T)? Where does this go? Why do we talk about this? Does this have something do with p(zt | z0, y)?"
