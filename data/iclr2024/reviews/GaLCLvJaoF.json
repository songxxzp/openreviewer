In control theory, using a switching law is independent of whether the system is non-linear or affine.\n2. An affine model can be tuned to be a close approximation to a non-linear model.\n3. A well-tuned affine model can be compatible with the underlying MBRL algorithm.\n\nThe text around eq. 10-11 is standard control theory: we tune an affine model for a set of operating conditions, and have a switching function that switches to the best-approximation affine model as appropriate.\n\nIt is confusing to try to follow the logic of p. 5, starting with \"Although using the above naive control-affine model can be convenient, it must trade in the capabilities of the underlying MBRL algorithm.\"\n\nThere are many overblown claims. such as: \n\n  (i) \"Classical control tools rely on extensively modeled dynamics that are gain scheduled, linear, and/or true up to parametric uncertainties. An example is prohibitively expensive wind-tunnel modeling for designing flight control systems (Neal et al., 2004; Nichols et al., 1993).\"\n\nThis is not true. Many modern approaches use nonlinear methods. Your example makes no sense.\n\n  (ii) \"MBRL algorithms often use highly nonlinear models (often NNs) that do not have true parameters corresponding to the ground truth dynamics, only optimal from a predictive sense, which makes consolidating MBRL with control theoretic tools challenging.\"\n\nThe following is over 10 years old and covers many topics in (ii):\n\nWang, X., & Hovakimyan, N. (2012). L1 adaptive controller for nonlinear time-varying reference systems.
