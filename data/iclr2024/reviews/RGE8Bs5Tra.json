The time variable is inferred from the predicted class id, since classes are learnt incrementally (and thus the predicted class ids reflect the order in which they were learnt).\n\nThe authors focus on class-incremental learning, and present an experimental validation on three benchmarks, pairwise MNIST, permuted-MNIST, and CIFAR-100 (10 tasks)."

The authors mention 10 tasks, but it is not clear whether that refers to 10 random permutations (each with its 10 digits), or to a single permutation (with the tasks being the individual digits). If the benchmark is used in a task-incremental way (10 permutations each with the full 10 digits available for the same permutation), then the EWC result with an accuracy of just 27% is puzzling, since the original paper -in that setting- achieves over 97-98% accuracy.\n    - Same for CIFAR-100; it is not clear what the 10 tasks refer to.

With a generated vector should be unlikely to replicate sensitive information.\n- Assuming that generative-based methods can be used in some scenarios where memory-based methods can not. The limitations on the dataset that can be represented with generative methods limit them to particular problems.\n    - I recommend finding an application, example or scenario where generating the input can help to present a more stimulating idea.\n- Figure 1 needs to be clarified.
