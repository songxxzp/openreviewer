The promise of the paper is that it will ground the thinking steps with LLMs in some objective framework that has been well-accepted in psychology/philosophy. What happens in the paper is that the coupling between Kant's theory and the UPAR framework is loose at best (compare figures 2 and 3). Now, the paper is unclear whether UPAR is: A) only inspired by this theory or B) claims to be supported by this theory (which is a much stronger claim). \n\nIf A) is the claim, then a loose coupling would be fine, but this would undermine many of the novelty claims (which are anyway difficult to follow), like \"often concentrate exclusively on local and specific reasoning processes, neglecting the intrinsic human cognitive structures underpinning language\", \"these tools are products of human thought, not the foundation of thinking\", and \"these tools are the creations of human intellect rather than the basis of human reliable thinking\".  \n\nIf B) is what the paper claims, then the authors really need to justify why Kant's theory is taken as the golden standard of \"human reliable thinking\" and how the UPAR framework aligns seriously with Kant's framework.\n\nW2) While the paper emphasizes the need for a model to receive the full complexity of UPAR thinking, in fact, the main UPAR variant being emphasized is its \"simple\" variant, which replaces the understanding aspects of Kant's framework with other ones (entities and relations) that are indeed intuitively more useful for the tasks at hand. Surprisingly, the authors do not comment on this finding and what this means for the overall premise of the work.\n\nW3) The paper makes claims that using reasoning would reduce \"illusions\", which is a nice and compelling statement. However, it is unclear whether UPAR indeed results in less illusions. In general, it is unclear what the qualitative improvement brought by UPAR is; but the improvement does not seem to be some emergent/qualitative jump, but rather a little better overall score while still producing judgments that are as unreliable as the baseline model (as far as I can see, there is no way to guarantee reliability of the reasoning in UPAR)."

Sections 3.2\u20133.4 just discuss the philosophical side and motivation without saying how the model is actually prompted. That seems to me like the most important thing to communicate in the paper. Please include it, like you did with \"Understand\". Also, please be more specific even in the \"Understand\" section about how your prompting approach works. Do you prompt it four separate times, once for each question? How do you instruct the model outside of just asking it the question?\n  b. Does it work only on instruction-tuned or RLHF models, or is it designed to work with pretrained LMs as well? Can you use few-shot examples? Where would they come from? Is there some set of tasks on which it doesn't work? What changes besides the simplification in UPAR-S might be necessary to make it work in other cases?\n2. The results are not very promising. It does yield improvements over zero-shot CoT with GPT-4, but only very small ones, and it's unclear whether they are statistically significant (how big are the test sets? What's the total n being tested on?). The only case of a large gap with GPT-4 zero-shot was on a subset of GSM8k _filtered to examples which zero-shot CoT with GPT-4 got wrong_ \u2014 not a fair comparison.\n3. It's not totally clear to me how deep the relationship goes between the prompting approach and the philosophical backdrop. Especially given the lack of detail in the paper, one can imagine many possible ways of implementing the same idea. Why this way in particular? For example, the assignment of questions to the pure categories of understanding seemed like a little bit of a stretch from its philosophical source material. If the whole point of the paper is that this framework follows from Kant, especially as the results are weak, I think it's important to make that case rock solid."
