This prevents us from discerning whether it really is the out-of-distribution attributes that increase the scores, or simply the difference between the generated images and the normal ones.\n1.2 \u2013 In 5.2, the authors intend to highlight the need of PaD over SaD. However, they do not actually compare them, with no results for SaD to be found in this section.\n1.3 \u2013 The approach would be, by nature, sensitive to the quality of the attribute detector, and only attributes that are consistently visually detectable should be used, since the metrics would be a mixture of the quality of the generator and that of the detector.\n2- The paper needs to be improved in terms of writing and structure.\n2.1 \u2013 With respect to the writing, there are many sentences that need some improvement. Just some examples:\n- \u201c They provide which attributes the models struggle.\u201d\n- \u201call SaD top-rank attributes have negative mean differences that mean SDs tend to omit some objects\u201d\n- \u201cWe infer that the color-related attributes are the inferiority of DMs\u201d\n2.2 \u2013 The mean difference (Eq 7), seems to be an element of the methodology but appears in the experiments section.\n2.3 \u2013 Many of the figures (like Fig 4a) display text that is impossible to read to to its size (and when zooming in it actually becomes pixelated).\n3 \u2013 Some of the comparisons could be more comprehensive. For instance, Table 4 shows no other metrics than the proposed ones."

Do humans agree that the attributes identified by SaD and PaD are indeed misrepresented in the generations of the model?\n\n\n[1] Thomas Unterthiner, Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Karol Kurach, Rapha\u00ebl Marinier, Marcin Michalski, Sylvain Gelly, FVD: A new Metric for Video Generation, ICLRW 2019"
