How would we treat an image with more channels, or a color image  represented via hue-saturation-value using quaternions? The point I'm trying to make is that I don't see a real connection between a color image and quaternions beyond a superficial coincidence of the number of channels with imaginary units. I'd be interested to hear if I'm missing something here.\n\n- I would welcome a more detailed development of the quaternionic DFT for orientation sequences -- specifically, does the fact that orientation quaternions have unit norm have any significance in this context?"

I do not consider norm/eigenvalue estimation to be an application problem, it is also particular to the choice of using QFT.\n - The presentation of the paper also fails to make clear the challenges or benefits of quaternions throughout, in particular,\n   * Quaternion representations are not introduced in the main body mathematically, and the difficulties of quaternion convolution are only discussed by reference to prior work.\n   * In contrast, the main body and the appendices largely restate standard algebraic derivations for DFT matrix properties and convolution. Analogous properties to the complex case are derived for quaternions with no motivation for why they are relevant to the contributions of the paper or nontrivial.\n - DFT/FFT correspondence for quaternion convolution has already been established in prior work, the paper seems to provide limited novelty, beyond establishing eigenvalue bounds (which are not motivated).\n    \n\nOverall, the paper seems to contain very incremental results for quaternion linear algebra that follow from existing work. The experimental comparisons do not consider alternative methods or previously existing works. The main theoretical results and applications considered in the paper are basic properties of quaternion convolution and DFT and basic linear algebra. I do not see specific relevance of the work to machine learning and I had difficulty gaining insight about the benefits or challenges of using quaternion convolution/DFT from both the body and the appendices of the paper.\n\nEDIT: I expanded and modified my review as I had previously failed to notice the proofs in Appendix F due to the page break on page 20."

However, I don't see why non-commutativity, two-sided convolution, versions of a convolution theorem, definition of determinant and the fact that $\\mu = -1$ has infinite solutions are problems. If these issues are to be avoided, then why not go back to the real domain? Isn't the desired structure of quaternions what precisely results in these _difficulties_?\n\n- Second, it is not clear how the machinery developed in Sec 3 impacts the machine/representation learning communities. I acknowledge the representation power of quaternions, however, this paper does not exploit this representation in the context of learning. I feel that this work lacks a clearer connection between the stated contributions and the learning task, possibly by showing examples where this representation makes a difference wrt standard (non-quaternion) methods. I also acknowledge the application in Sec 4, however, the body of results presented in Sec 3 is far more general than that particular application.\n\n- There are a few typos, for instance: the _extend_ on which ...\n\n- Lastly, what do the authors mean by _[treating] signals in a holistic manner_?"
