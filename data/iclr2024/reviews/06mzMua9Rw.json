                "value": "- First, a general comment about so-called \u201ctrust region\u201d methods in RL: upon reading a standard text on nonlinear programming (e.g., Nocedal and Wright, or Bertsekas), I am increasingly dissatisfied with how the RL community seems to neglect some of the key ideas and defining characteristics of trust region methods. I am not trying to pin blame anywhere, but rather suggest that the authors might do well to try and exploit some of these classical ideas in RL. A few examples:\n    - Trust region methods sequentially optimize a model of the true objective built around a nominal point, and at every step, constrain the feasible set to a ball centered at that point. In this paper, the objective in (2) does not appear to be a local approximation to the true objective at current iterate $\\theta_k$. Perhaps there is room for improvement here?\n    - Likewise, a key idea in the design of good trust region methods is that the size of the feasible set changes at each iteration to reflect how closely the previous \u201cmodel\u201d matched the true objective. How is $\\epsilon_k$ varied across iterations? Does it try to capture this kind of model-mismatch? Perhaps this could be a good direction for improvement.\n- nit: this kind of work really reminds me of [1]. While I understand the methods are quite different, the basic problem is the same. I encourage the authors to investigate this literature and discuss connections. (I am not an author of this paper, by the way)\n- In 3.1 (first paragraph), the subscript notation on $\\mathbb{E}$ could be explained more carefully. This leads to ambiguities later on, e.g., in (1) where my best guess is that s and aanare drawn from distributions d, \\pi respectively. But clearly these variables are dependent upon one another, and that dependence is not really very clearly expressed in the notation. One could, for example, imagine that (1) is trying to say that we should sample independent copies of the state and action from their marginal distributions. What is really going on here could be easily clarified by being more precise with notation earlier on.\n- Similarly, the role of b_P^\\pi is not really made clear when it is first introduced or used in (1), and the reader is left to infer what it is from context and use.\n- It seems like a key problem the method will have is the estimation of $d_{P_t}^{\\pi_\\theta}$ from only a few target domain trajectories. Kernel density estimation is known to be data inefficient, and I am quite skeptical about how the IL methods are going to scale here while remaining accurate. Some discussion here would be good, ideally accompanied by experimental results which highlight performance as a function of the amount of target domain data.\n- nit: it is a bit odd that the Nachum 2019 paper is mentioned as coming chronologically after (\u201cthen used\u2026\u201d) Touati 2020.\n- I do not follow the brief discussion in the sentences above section 4.2.\n- Proposition 4.1 does not make much sense to me, although the proof steps are indeed straightforward. What I mean is this:\n    - First off, so far as I see, the variable J is never defined anywhere.\n    - Relatedly, it is unclear if this result is intended to apply at each iteration of the proposed approach, or to its final result, or even if it has any relationship to the proposed approach (i.e., is it just a general result about sim-to-real?). Relatedly, I suspect (but could not point to a specific paper) that this result is known in the literature since it does not clearly pertain to the proposed algorithm. Perhaps I am just confused. Help me to understand.\n    - There is no mention of \\epsilon anywhere in the result. Surely the size of the feasible set should influence performance of the proposed algorithm.\n- nit: in the caption for table 1, I do not see how one can \u201cminimize the state(-action) visitation distribution\u201d itself. One can minimize a metric of that distribution, but not the distribution itself, right?\n- In the experimental protocol paragraph, the bit about removing trajectories that perform poorly in the real environment confuses me. Isn\u2019t that phenomenon exactly what the proposed method is trying to fix? Wouldn\u2019t seeing state transitions that result in poor performance be essential?\n    - OR, as I suspect, what is going on here is really that the \u201ctrust-region\u201d constraint/regularizer is effectively saying that the simulation has to visit the same states/actions as the real environment (regardless of how much reward they accrued). Something seems strange about this. Comment would be appreciated.\n- Dividing the stddev by two in plots is a good indication that results are insignificant\u2026 It is also totally statistically useless when computed from 4 random seeds. Why not just show the min and max of all runs? These kinds of statistics are misleading at best -  this kind of thing is common in the literature, and I think it is high time that the community fix such mistakes.\n- The discussion below Fig. 1 is confusing to me, and not particularly convincing. For example, how could \u201ca high value induce the agent to replicate real environment trajectories\u201d result in \u201cbehavior close to RL_sim?\u201d What am I missing here? More generally, I really don\u2019t see much of a pattern in the figures - it seems like everything is very environment dependent, and as above, I would not draw statistical conclusions from such little data.\n- Last, I feel it is a bit unfortunate that a paper on \u201csim-to-real\u201d did not actually test anything in the real \u201creal world.\u201d Why not try something on a real robot or other setup and put things to the test? I certainly understand that such a test means a lot of work, but it would also go a long way to illustrating the practicality of the proposed method. For instance, there is precious little discussion of the real-world data complexity of the method!\n\n[1] Marco, Alonso, et al. \"Virtual vs. real: Trading off simulations and physical experiments in reinforcement learning with Bayesian optimization.\" 2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

To fix the Sim2Real problem in robotics, domain randomization is an important approach and generally helps improve the robustness of policy trained from the simulator. Is it possible to add this baseline? Logically speaking, if the domain randomization is strong enough to cover the dynamics in the real world, this baseline can perform really well in the evaluation.  I noticed this paper assumes the simulator is a black box. Is this the reason that domain randomization should not be used as a baseline? Why do we need to be constrained by this assumption?\n\n3.

The text also mentions that \"FOOD, DARC, and ANE are trained for 5000 epochs in the simulated environment\" but does not mention CQL. This leads me to believe that CQL is only trained on the limited real data, but not on simulated data. In that case, I am not clear on what regularization is used. I would think the most obvious way to implement a CQL baseline is to train on simulated data primarily, and use the real data to reguarlize the Q value. This can be done with online Q learning in the simulated enviornment. I apologize if I am misunderstanding here. \n* In a similar vein, simple baselines like TD3+BC can be used, where TD3 is done in simulated environment with BC regularization from real data."
