Evaluations of LLM and non-LLM agents show that the common-sense reasoning in LLMs is beneficial, but they lack ability to react to dynamic environment changes."

This seems like a scenario of practical relevance for search-and-rescue applications.\n\nThe physics of the fire / flood / wind, albeit simplistic, seem sufficient for meaningful yet systematic changes to occur in the environments. The visual rendering of the effects is sufficiently realistic judging from the photos provided.\n\nIt is nice that the benchmark supports language-based descriptions and interaction out of the box to facilitate research on higher level reasoning systems while removing the burden of low-level control and perception if not desired.\n\nFurther, the procedural environment generation allows for the creation and evaluation of diverse scenes, so that overfitting to a few environments is prevented."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While I like the text-based interface, it also seems like a weakness of the benchmark that it seems primarily designed to evaluate the high-level reasoning capabilities of agents, rather than the potentially more challenging low-level manipulation aspects of these tasks. To put differently, would there be any difference if the benchmark wasn't implemented with a nice graphics pipeline but instead as a fully text-based game a la nethack? My understanding is that at least the main LLM planner method would work without change.\n\nI do acknowledge that the authors try to provide versions of the benchmark that require visual perception of the environment. It would be nice though if a similar array of different options was provided on the action representation side. The current benchmark only supports very high-level actions. It is further unclear whether the RL policy that the authors compare to has all the same privileged observation and action primitive access that the LLM planner has. A fair comparison would be good here.\n\nThere is some information that is missing from the paper (see questions below). The paper does provide some videos on their website, but the videos \"with agent\" did not load for me, which makes it hard to judge how fast the environment changes with respect to the speed of the agent, and thus how challenging the tasks are.\n\nWhile the current split of train:test is reasonable, it would be nice to investigate certain axis of generalization for the different agents more systematically. E.g. one could specifically test generalization to larger rooms or to new objects etc.\n\nFinally, as acknowledged by the authors, the agent currently has no way of *influencing* the dynamics of the environment, e.g. by putting out the fires instead of working around them. It would be good to add such capabilities to more holistically evaluate disaster responses, but I acknowledge that this is challenging and the lack thereof does not invalidate the contributions of this submission."

I appreciate the adaptations to the benchmark, in particular taking environment effects on the agent into account and supporting generalization evaluations.\nOverall, I support acceptance of the paper. I also skimmed through the other reviews and the rebuttal seems to at least in part address the concerns of the reviewer that voted \"marginally below acceptance\", so I will increase my score to accept."
