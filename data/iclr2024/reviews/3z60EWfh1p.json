Assuming that the latent vectors of the model lie on a smooth Riemannian manifold, the paper suggests that for effective transfer learning, source and target tasks need to be mapped to regions with large overlap. The paper describes how diffeomorphisms between pairs of tasks can be learned using parametric encoders and decoders, such that individual data points are confined to a locally flat frame in the overlap region. This is a local Euclidean approximation that helps simplify distance calculation when only small perturbations are concerned.\n\nThe proposed method (GATE) adds 3 losses to the regression loss: an auto-encoder loss for the choice of diffeomorphism modeling, a consistency loss that pivots points on the overlapping region, a mapping loss that enforces predictions to be preserved through the transforms, and a distance loss that forces distances between pivot points and perturbations to be equal across tasks. The distance loss can be viewed as a regularizer.\n\nThe proposed method is evaluated on a transfer learning task for molecular property prediction and is shown to outperform alternatives in a majority of the transfer tasks considered. The overall RMSE is also significantly lower than the baseline methods."

This significantly cuts into the impact of the paper as the results cannot (in good faith) be extrapolated to a completely different domain of tasks.\n\nWith a single model architecture for molecular property prediction as the only domain, a more detailed description is missing from the main body of the paper (e.g. input/output/latent dimensions, range of values, SMILES format, DMPNN layers, etc.). The paper is not self-contained when it comes to model components.\n\nThe paper is hard to follow in parts, as the overall picture takes more than 4 pages to be completely laid out. I think an overview of all the losses can be included earlier in the paper to help with the flow and clarity of the paper.\n\nSince the heavy machinery of Riemannian geometry is not really used in the paper (apart from freedom for choice of local coordinates and the overall smoothness assumptions), IMO the elaborate dive into the nuances of dealing with geodesics in an arbitrary metric space is unnecessary, if not needlessly confusing. There is no point introducing the Christoffel symbol just to scare off a reader that might think a nice closed-form solution is possible in the generic case. I\u2019d suggest removing derivations and definitions that do not contribute to the flow of the paper."
