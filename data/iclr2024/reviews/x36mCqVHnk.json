The paper notes that it is the first work to achieve this type of optimality. The paper is based on Q-learning, where its main novelty is in introducing a variance reduction technique for single-player reinforcement learning. However, because the games does not exhibit monotonicity the way single-player systems do, the authors introduce the use of two estimates of value functions: optimistic value functions and pessimistic value functions. The general framework they use comes from the Nash Q-learning framework, but that framework does not provide optimality bounds with respect to the horizon which is the subject of the current work."

The lower bound for two-player zero-sum Markov games is Omega(H^3S(A+B)/eps^2) . The work of \"Near-Optimal Reinforcement Learning with Self-Play\" gives bounds that are O(H^5SABi/eps^2). The present work gives a bound O(H^3SAB/eps^2), which is a large improvement when the horizon is very large. Another strength is the novelty of the proof technique. The proof technique draws upon a variance reduction technique in single player settings. In order to adequately incorporate the variance reduction technique, the authors store optimistic and pessimistic estimates of the optimal value function, rather than only optimistic which is used in the single player setting. Doing this allows the authors to obtain convergence guarantees."

This is because the algorithm is largely inspired by their algorithm. Additionally, both algorithms use upper and lower bounds for the value function (I'm not sure if I'm using the term here in the right way), which is one of the crucial pieces that allows the algorithm of the current work to get the optimality in H bound. In this way, the key novelty would be clearer. \nI also think that because the algorithm builds upon another algorithm and modifies the bound to make the dependence on H stronger by a factor of H^2, it may be useful to incorporate more than one theorem to show extensions such as incorporating the use of function approximation etc. Or perhaps the authors could look at an extension where the agents play against each other."

I understand that there is a monotonicity assumption that is required to be overcome in order for single player reinforcement learning settings to be applied to multi-agent reinforcement learning. Prior works have used various properties to overcome this monotonicity assumption (see the work of https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09716 for example). However, to me it is not immediately clear how simply storing reference values of optimistic and pessimistic value functions overcomes the monotonicity assumption. This is because when there is no noise, i.e., perfect estimates of the value functions, then that would mean that there would be no need for an optimistic or pessimistic bound and only one bound would be needed. But if that is the case, when the monotonicity issue still would not go away, since the monotonicity issue inevitably arises in games versus single player settings. So then I'm confused what is the exact role of the optimistic and pessimistic estimates of the optimal value function. \nAnother question I have is what is the difference between your proof techniques and those in \"Near-Optimal Reinforcement Learning with Self-Play\". This is because they also use optimistic and pessimistic estimates of the optimal value function. However, their bounds are clearly less tight than yours since they are of order H^3. Could you please provide a comparison to that work or point me to where you discuss it in the paper?"

Does it refers to $\\Delta(s,h)$ which is the minimum gap over all episodes and this ensures monotonicity?\n2) You say that using the techniques of [40] for single agent RL is challenging due to the fact the upper bounds are no longer monotonic. It is unclear way this is needed. More precisely, the last two paragraphs on page 4 are really hard to read and do not convey clearly neither the challenges nor the contributions.\n3) Algorithm 1 gives too many unnecessary details, and simplifying it would help the reader understand better its workings. In particular, I think lines 9 to 13 are never commented and could be written with $O$ notation or something alike.\n4) In algorithm 1 the actions played come from a correlated strategy (line 6)? Can the learning be decoupled by marginalising $\\pi$ or the marginalisation has to happen only at the end of the learning procedure?\n5) On page 5 the authors refer to a \"standard update\". What is this standard update and what is \"bonus\"?\n6) It is never explained what CCE has to do with the problem of computing Nash equilibrium. After some tome I arrived at the conclusion that it is the \"collapse\" idea first introduced in \"Cai, Yang, et al. \"Zero-sum polymatrix games: A generalization of minmax.\" Mathematics of Operations Research (2016)\" in which the CCE of a $\\epsilon$-perturbed zero sum game is an $\\epsilon$-CCE of the zero sum games which marginalisation is in turn a $O(\\epsilon)$ of the Nash of the zero sum game. I get that this idea was already presented in [36] but the authors should at least presented at a high level this idea.\n7) I think you are missing to discuss the decentralised model-free algorithm of \"On improving model-free algorithms for decentralised multi-agent reinforcement learning\", but there's no issue there as it obtains a $O(H^5)$ sample complexity, although the dependency on $A$ is optimal"
