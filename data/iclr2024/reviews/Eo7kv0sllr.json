Given a smaller pre-trained model $\\pi_{ref}^{M}$, its fine-tuned counterpart $\\pi^{M}$, and a larger pre-trained model $\\pi_{ref}^{N}$, EFT emulate the effect of combining the pre-trained knowledge in $\\pi_{ref}^{N}$ and the knowledge learned by $\\pi^{M}$ by simply computing \n$\\log \\pi_{ref}^{N}(y|x) + (   \\log \\pi^{M}(y|x)     - log  \\pi_{ref}^{M}(y|x) )$.\n\nUsing EFT, they show that scaling pre-training (model size) mostly improves factuality, and scaling fine-tuning (model size) mostly improves helpfulness. \nThey also propose a special case of EFT that uses a large pre-trained model and two small models (one pre-trained and the other fine-tuned) called up-scaling, which can emulate the case when fine-tuning the large model without actually fine-tuning the large model.\nThey show that EFT can also be combined with speculative decoding to speed up the inference speed, and they use top-p truncation to improve the performance of up-scaling."

Still, the inference time can be reduced by speculative decoding. This makes me doubt the practical value of EFT and upscaling. \n- It is unclear how much up-scaling recovers the performance of fine-tuning the large model. The paper only reports the improvement of the up-scaled model compared with the pre-trained large model, but I think it is also important to report the performance of the fine-tuned large model. This way we can understand if up-scaling can close the gap of fine-tuning the large model, or if the performance still largely lags behind the fine-tuned large model. This is an important information for practical use cases. Still, I want to emphasize that this paper's contribution to proposing the EFT framework is ample contribution, and even if there are several drawbacks in practical usage, I still consider this paper a good paper.\n- The math in Section 3 is kind of confusing. I will elaborate on them in the question part.\n- Some minor presentation issues. The paper might need proofreading.\n   -  Section 3.1:  ` we view the result of fine-tuning is the solution to` $\\to$ `we view the result of fine-tuning **as** the solution to`.\n   -  Section 3.1: `Crucially, while the EFT framework is justified with an RL interpretation is applicable to any fine-tuned model` $\\to$ `Crucially, while the EFT framework is justified with an RL interpretation, **it** is applicable to any fine-tuned model`\n   - Page 6: `with on` $\\to$ `with`\n   - Section 4: `While prompts in the HH dataset are more everyday and conversational, asking for movie recommendations or instructions or home maintanence tasks.` $\\to$ This is not a complete sentence.\n    - Section 4.3 and 4.4: I think you should first introduce the method and then refer to the experiment results in the tables."

The paper mainly focuses on generation tasks related to factuality and helpfulness/harmlessness. I wonder does EFL, or precisely, up-scaling, also show improvement in multiple-choice datasets like MMLU?"
