I list them below by category.\n\n**Risks of model release**: Authors base their studies on safety-tuned models and present approaches that revert the safety mechanisms (e.g., RLHF). However, from a practical viewpoint, a raw pretrained model can likely be more easily adapted to produce harmful content than a safety-tuned model. Given that raw pretrained models are typically released along with safety-tuned variants (e.g., Llama2 / Llama2-Chat), it's worthwhile to measure how fine-tuning approaches work there. How much easier is it to adapt a raw pretrained model to produce harmful content compared to a safety-tuned one? \n\n**Economic incentives**: The cost of performing these adversarial adaptations is likely low, considering the main method is LoRA fine-tuning on a small batch of examples. However, it's still useful to elucidate the cost of these attacks to make the analysis complete. How much does it cost ($) to adapt one model? How much time does it take? How many GPUs would you need? \n\n**Clarity on harmful content**: Authors use the generic umbrella term \"harmful\" as the inverse term of \"value-aligned\". However, it is worthwhile to clarify the types of harmful content being studied. Is it primarily hate speech and toxicity? Or is it misinformation or something else?\n\nI read the author comments and updated my score. The submission remains a borderline one given its limited novelty."

                "value": "- For GPT-4 evaluation, what quality control measures have the authors adopted? To what extent are the numbers trustworthy? \n- MMLU is a useful proxy for measuring general model capability. But it is not a good proxy for assessing models' helpfulness in following instructions. Have the authors attempted other datasets for helpfulness evaluation? E.g., Anthropic's HH dataset or AlpacaEval?\n- The title is misleading for two reasons:\n  - \"Open-source\" is a very specific term which doesn't accurately describe the settings for which these attacks may be applied. For \n  instance, the supervised fine-tuning attack can be applied to API models (OpenAI fine-tuning API). In addition, certain models have \n  released weights but are not open-source -- the famous llama model is released under restricted licenses and thus doesn't count as\nopen-source. But the model itself can be called an open model. \n  - Despite the drawbacks studied in the paper, open-source also has its benefits. For instance, this research is made possible with open models with weight releases. Thus, saying \"open-source is dangerous\" conveys a limited and inadequate view."

Even though they also evaluate its performance on other datasets, the fine-tuning dataset has contained all kinds of harmful scenarios, thus it is hard to demonstrate its universality on unseen harmful instructions.\n\n3.
