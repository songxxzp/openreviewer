The main contribution of the framework is a multi-view cycle consistency loss where low-res features are matched to its upsampled and downsampled ones. Two instantiations are presented. One is inspired by joint bilateral upsampling, and a fast CUDA implementation is provided. The other is inspired by NeRF where upsampled features are optimized per image. The authors have demonstrated good visualizations of the upsampled feature maps and show that the presented upsampling framework can preserve good semantic smoothness and boundary sharpness. The effectiveness of the framework is validated on a number of tasks."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While I generally like the idea of the cycle-consistent training, I have a number of major concerns on the specific operators used/proposed and the results presented.\n- **The focus of the paper seems unclear**. Being a feature upsampling framework, the framework should be agnostic to the specific downsampling or upsampling operator chosen. Yet, the current approach leaves me an impression that the framework only works on the proposed learned downsamplers and upsamplers. If the framework matters, some additional existing downsampler-upsampler pairs should be demonstrated to demonstrate its generality; If the proposed operators matter, the contributions and the title may need to be revised.\n\n- Following my previous comment, I think the problem is that the authors attempt to combine many seemingly related techniques together. For instance, the JBU and its fast CUDA implementation look standalone to me. It is unclear to me what the role of the JBU is in the framework, particularly when it is claimed as a contribution. Please explain why JBU is essential to the FeatUp framework. In addition, applying JBU to feature upsampling is not new. \"Fast End to End Trainable Guided Filter\" CVPR18 and \"Superpixel Convolutional Networks using Bilateral Inceptions\" ECCV16 are two example works, which is also missing in the related work.\n\n- **The ablation study of the paper is poor**. It is unclear to me what exactly leads to the good feature quality. Aside from the loss, there are a number of tricky designs in the downsampler and upsampler used. For example, why a blur kernel must be used in downsampling? And why introducing the saliency map and how it works? Why a simple 1x1 convolution is sufficient to present the saliency map? Would it be precise enough? Also, the implicit FeatUp produces significantly better visualizations according to Fig. 5. Is it because of the per-image optimization. A thorough ablation study is required.\n\n- **The method may be justified in an inappropriate setting**. According to Table 1, FeatUp (Implicit) has reported significant performance improvements on the transfer learning setting. Yet, this setting is rarely used in feature upsampling literature. Why choosing this setting? I wonder how the parameters of comparing upsamplers are updated in this setting. In addition, the comparison between the implicit variant and other upsamplers seems unfair, because other upsamplers do not optimize the per-image upsampling quality. This also leads to the next issue.\n\n- **The practicality of the implicit FeatUp seems poor**. In reality, the per-image optimization of upsampling is unrealistic, it is not likely that the implicit variant is used as a plug-in in existing networks (the experimental setting in Table 2 also confirms my opinion). But I think this approach can somehow indicate an upper bound of upsampling quality.\n\n- The performance of baseline approaches does not align with the number reported in the corresponding papers and is significantly lower. For example, SAPA reports 44.4 mIoU but the table in Table 2 only reports 41.6. Please check."

                "value": "Please see the weaknesses for my major concerns. I have also some other suggestions:\n\nIs it appropriate to indicate augmented low-res features as different views? In 3D, different views often imply different view points.\n\nIn addition, the organization of related work does not make sense to me. \n- First, the paper does not conduct experiments on image super-resolution. This sub-section seems redundant. \n- Second, the references in general-purpose feature upsampling are weird. Both Amir et al. (2021) and Tumanyan et al. (2022) do not study feature upsampling at all. Why are the two papers cited? In my opinion, most references discussed in the section of image-adaptive feature upsampling should be discussed in this section. As far as I know, CARAFE is one of the first paper studying general-purpose feature upsampling. \n- In addition, some closely related approaches compared in experiments are not discussed/compared in related work such as FADE and SAPA.\n\nPlease address my major concerns in the rebuttal. I would re-evaluaute the paper conditioned on the response."

For example, in the context of any-resolution upsampling of feature map, Learning implicit feature alignment function for semantic segmentation (ECCV 2022) seems to be related, does the proposed method show advantages over the prior work?\n2. How does the computation cost (in FLOPS) compare to prior works in main tables? Since the proposed method is a new upsampler, it would better demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method by comparing the computation cost.\n3. In practice, why the reconstruction of features at any-resolution is important? Typically, the encoder takes a fixed-resolution input, the task is more likely to be fixed-resolution rather than any-resolution.
