In addition to the method presented in this paper, the existence of low-dimensional structures, such as low-rankness [1] and matrix product operators [2], offers another avenue for decreasing the number of necessary repeated measurements.

The main reason for concern here is the reported performance of the method vs. number of samples (Figure 5 and left panel of Figure 3), where the fidelity seems to degrade as the algorithm is given access to more measurement outcomes. The explanation for this strange behavior provided in the text (\"As the sample size is increased, the fidelity drops due to the overfitting of the data\") seems highly unlikely, as overfitting typically becomes _less_ of an issue as more training data is provided. In the similar work of [Perlin et al. (2021)] for example, the fidelity increases monotonically with sample count for every tomographic method tested, converging to a fidelity of 1 in the large sample limit for each case (see Fig. 5 of that work). In light of this, the fact that the authors' results doesn't show any meaningful improvement with greater access to samples is concerning.\n\n* The experiments supporting this method are fairly weak, in that they only consider a single simple type of quantum circuit. Although the authors compare the findings of this experiment to those of [Perlin et al. (2021)] (\"their reconstruction procedure requires 1 million samples whereas we attain the same fidelity with only 100 samples\"), this comparison is misleading, as the prior work tested their method against families of random circuits, clearly a more difficult task. I would encourage the authors to at least generalize their single GHZ example to a family of random quantum states, for example by adding random SU(2) rotations in the middle of the GHZ preparation circuit.\n\n* Having a direct comparison between the proposed method and past tomographic methods on the same quantum circuits would be helpful for assessing the performance of this method, as no comparison is offered to prior work that actually used this same family of quantum circuits."
