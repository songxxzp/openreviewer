The experimental validation of the proposed model focuses on Scan-to-CAD (S2C) \u2014 a sub-task of reconstructing indoor environments, including point cloud registration, retrieval, and completion \u2014 and provides a considerable improvement over the baseline models."

However, the method section is missing the crucial part of the equivariance discussion, which is instead placed in the Appendix.\n\nW3. A more detailed complexity analysis is required (see the Questions), as the brief mention in the conclusion does not suffice."
