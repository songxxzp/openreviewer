The proposed FIAT combines the advantages of ICL and PEFT. On the one hand, it can leverage the knowledge from the most capable LLMs, and on the other hand, it utilizes PEFT from the modestly-sized LLM with training data from the downstream task. The experiments demonstrate that FIAT indeed benefits from these two aspects and achieves performance improvement.\n2. FIAT seems to be somewhat similar to the previous neural network distillation: obtaining soft labels from a large model to improve the performance of a small model. In this work, the large model provides CoT explanations as few-shot demonstrations for the small model. This utilization method appears to be clever and consistent with the idea of providing demonstrations for downstream tasks as ICL does. The authors also show through experiments that utilizing CoT explanations in the manner of ICL is superior to using them as multitask outputs."

Personally, this might be a bit of an overclaim for the contribution of this work. Although this work combines the in-context inference of large models and the parameter-efficient fine-tuning of medium models, it primarily holds true for limited computation costs. Under limited compute cost, for large models like the PaLM L model, we can only use ICL to adapt the model to specific downstream tasks and can not perform PEFT. On the other hand, from the perspective of combining the ICL and PEFT paradigms, it is worth noting that the models used in this paper are not the same. A more appropriate expression could be: combining the ICL of a large model and the PEFT of a medium model.\n\nMiscellaneous:\n1. In the knowledge transfer paragraph of Section 5: \u201cMore recently, the latter has approach has been extended\u201d.\n2. There is overlap in the subfigures of Figure 6."

Adding CoT explanations in ICL may reduce the length of instruction that can be provided. In practice, how to control the length of CoT explanation, that is, how to take the balance between the $I_\\tau$ and $\\hat{y}_\\beta$? \n2. Taking more additional data into the PEFT could help the LLM adapt to the specific downstream task. This is relatively easy to understand. What is the role of adding the CoT explanations in the Instruction for performance improvement? Besides its high-level help of taking the capacity from a larger LLM, does it have any further impact? Does FIAT potentially assume that the LLM ($\\theta_\\beta$) performs well for the current task in order to obtain meaningful explanations instead of providing misleading ones?"

The proposed method provides little novel contribution, the basic idea is to use an expert LLM to generate data to improve downstream models has already been explored in very similar scenarios. For example, [1] an expert LLM to generate possible continuations that are then filtered (to improve quality) and used for subsequent fine-tuning to get the final downstream model. Retrieval Augmented Generation methods (e.g. [2]) follow the same idea but, rather than generating new samples form an expert LLM, they leverage an external source of information to fill the model context before generation. Furthermore, [3] follows a similar trajectory, where, continuations of language only GPT-4 are directly used as supervised data for instruction tuning of Visual Language Models. \nOverall, the idea proposed in this paper can be seen as a form of automatic data augmentation/synthetic data generation, as such it is very close to previously proposed methods both in NLP and in the intersection between Vision and Language.\n2. **(Clarity)** The paper is quite hard to read and often unfocused jumping between different methods while adding a lot of repetitions. See for example Section 2.3. And, it is quite hard to find a clear scientific hypothesis that the authors want to test/validate. \n3. **(Soundness)** While augmenting the context of LLM with tokens from other expert (strong models) or even humans is not new and has been proven to work well in practice multiple times. I am a bit puzzled by some claims in the paper. LLMs are know to often hallucinate irrelevant content or just provide answers containing many repetitions (especially when greedy decoding is used as in the first stage of generation proposed here). So, how did authors make sure that the CoT explanation is of high quality? And in the worst case, i.e. when some bad explanations are given, how does the smaller LLM recover from the misleading context? In the current manuscript no intuitions are given nor algorithmic solutions are attempted to ameliorate this problem.\n\n\n[1] Yizhong W. et al., \"SELF-INSTRUCT: Aligning Language Models with Self-Generated Instructions\"\n\n[2] Aleksandra P. et al.,\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks\"\n\n[3] Haotian L. et al., \"LLaVA: Large Language and Vision Assistant\""
