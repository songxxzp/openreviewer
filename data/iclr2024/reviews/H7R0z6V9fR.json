                "value": "Main Contribution and Ablation Study\n\nAs the authors point out, closely related ideas to those one proposed here have been around for a while (see e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02236 for Koopman operators, or, as the authors point out, in a very similar form in Huang et al. 2020).\nTo my understanding, the main contribution is a slight reformulation of the consistency loss from Huang et al. 2020, Eq.11, so that the consistency is computed between forward and backward generated trajectories (as a form of self-consistency) and not between the predicted forward-and backward trajectories and the ground-truth data. They argue that when performing the comparison to ground-truth data, \u201csuch implicit regularization does not force time-reversal symmetry, but introduce more noise\u201d.\nThe comparison of their approach with the alternative of the time reversal symmetry loss (gt-rev in Table 1) are not as convincing to me as the authors claim, since they appear quite close to their own results. Without provided statistics, it's challenging to gauge the robustness of this effect, especially given the unexpected four-digit precision in a stochastic optimization setting.\n\nThe whole paragraph explaining the ablation study (\u201cFinally, we conduct two ablation by changing the implementation\u201d) I found a little confusing, also given there are several grammatical inconsistencies here. Since this reformulation is highlighted as the main contribution, it would benefit from further elaboration and clarity.\n\nChoice of comparisons:\n\nComparing to single-agent models on benchmarks that seem tailored to favor the inductive bias of multi-agent systems may not be particularly enlightening. Given the contribution is about improving performance with a specific formulation of a time reversal symmetry loss, investigating this for other dynamical systems and models, and e.g. comparing performance for several types of ODE models both with and without this time reversal symmetry loss, would make more sense in my opinion.\n\nLimited Application:\n\nThe proposal in this paper, focusing on time reversal symmetry, isn't exclusive to latent graph ODEs or multi-agent dynamical systems, and has been studied in other contexts. As the authors mention, time reversal symmetry is a universal physical principle, and its incorporation through a time-reversal-sensitive loss is potentially more far-reaching. Merely extending it to a pre-existing architecture (GraphODEs) doesn't, in itself, signify a substantial contribution. The real value of the present study to my mind lies in the exploration of different forms of this time reversal consistency loss. This exploration could be more valuable if taken beyond the confines of multi-agent GraphODEs. Discussions about its applicability to other dynamical system architectures and other, e.g. single-agent systems, would make sense in this context. An investigation into Theorem 1's implications for the loss in Eq. 5 might also be interesting, since I'd suspect the scaling with sequence length T is different here. The conclusion could also discuss the potential of this loss in various contexts.\n\nWhile there are interesting first steps taken in this paper, there is still room to extend these ideas to a wider, more generally applicable framework and theoretical investigation. Otherwise the contribution is quite limited and the experimental underpinning not fully convincing. If these concerns are addressed I am happy to adjust my score."

                "value": "**1. Reversing operator**\n\nFirst, I would appreciate clarification on the precise calculation of the reversing operator $R$ for TANGO. While the reversing operator holds a significant role in addressing time-reversal symmetry, the current version of the paper lacks a detailed description and computation method for it (if this information is located in the appendix, I apologize; however, I would recommend including it in the main text of the revised version for clarity). Considering that the reversing operator is typically defined in the phase space $(q, p)$, as mentioned in footnote 3, it remains unclear how it can be computed within the latent space $z$. At first glance, I think there are possible approaches, although they are all have some concerns:\n\nThe first approach involves splitting $z$ into two components, $(z_0, z_1)$, with $z_0$ serving as a pseudo $q$ and $z_1$ as a pseudo $p$, defining $R: (z_0, z_1, t) \\to (z_0, -z_1, -t)$. However, questions arise regarding the effectiveness of such a straightforward separation, as constraints similar to those found in variational Hamiltonian Monte Carlo literature might need to be imposed on $z_1$.\n\nSecondly, one might consider reversing the observations $y = (q, p)$ directly, i.e., $\\hat{R}: (q, p, t) \\to (q, -p, -t)$, and then assume $R \\circ z = f_{dec}(\\hat{R} \\circ y)$. However, in this case, the reversing operation $R$ within the latent dynamics might not be an involution.\n\nLastly, a simple identity operation, i.e., $z$, where $R: (z, t) \\to (z, -t)$ might be employed. Currently, it appears that this operation is used in the paper. However, assuming the use of $R: (z, t) \\to (z, -t)$ raises a new question, which I will discuss in the following section.\n\n**2. Time-reversal symmetry or time-reversibility?**\n\nSince there is no explicit definition of the reversing operator, I will assume that it solely reverses the dynamics in the context of the time direction, as described in equation (8) (i.e., solving the latent ODE in $-t$ direction). In this case, I have reservations about whether equation (9), as implemented in the paper, indeed enforces time-reversal symmetry regularization for the learned dynamics. It appears to me that equation (9) may promote time-reversibility (invertibility) rather than time-reversal symmetry. I believe it is crucial to rigorously differentiate between these two concepts within this work.\n\nTime-reversal symmetry implies that forward and backward time dynamics are indistinguishable. In contrast, time reversibility implies that these two dynamics can be distinguished but are one-to-one mappings of each other (i.e., the dynamics have a unique solution over a given time interval). For instance, an ideal oscillator would remain indistinguishable whether it evolves with forward or reverse time dynamics, thereby clearly exhibiting time-reversal symmetry. Conversely, a damped oscillator can be distinguished in this context. The forward time evolution reduces amplitude over time, while the backward time evolution increases it. This system lacks time-reversal symmetry but still poses time-reversibility (invertibility) because when a video of a damped oscillator is played in reverse, it returns to the initial frame due to the existence of a unique solution, i.e., well-defined dynamics.\n\nTaking this into account, equation (9) appears to be a loss function designed to promote time reversibility, as evident from the lower middle figure in Figure 2. It is worth noting that many deterministic ODEs, including those governing physical systems, are theoretically guaranteed to exhibit invertibility (uniqueness of solutions) according to the Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem. However, in practice, the actual solutions computed by numerical solvers like RK45 may not always be perfectly invertible, especially in the case of chaotic systems and homoclinic orbits. It is conceivable that the proposed regularization of TANGO compensates for such deviations from the limited precision of numerical solvers or sensitivity on initial conditions for chaotic systems (does this align with the findings of Theorem 1? I haven't verified the appendix). Alternatively, TANGO might learn smoother and more noise-resistant dynamics thanks to matching the forward and inverse trajectories.\n\nI do not intend to argue that TANGO lacks technical validity; it is reasonable to expect that TANGO's predictive performance can be improved by introducing the proposed regularization, regardless of whether the target dynamics are conservative, non-conservative, T-symmetric, or T-asymmetric. However, I find it challenging to assert that the added regularization arises from time-reversal symmetry based on the current presentation of the paper. Therefore, I remain somewhat unconvinced by the argument presented in this paper."

Alternatively, does it promote time-reversibility (= invertibility, solution uniqueness, reduction of numerical divergence, ...), as previously mentioned?\"\n\n- It would be valuable to explore the influence of the solver choice, particularly for LGODE, TANGO, TANGO (gt-rev), and TANGO (rev2) models, through ablation studies. For instance, what would be the outcome when employing a higher-order solver in lieu of the conventional RK45? Or, how would lower-order solvers like Euler impact the results? How about Leapfrog? Assuming that the proposed loss function indeed promotes time-reversibility (invertiblity), it is plausible that the effectiveness of TANGO could diminish as the solver's precision increases.\n\n- In Figure 5, it is noticeable that HODEN, a model known for strict energy conservation, exhibits energy divergence in the damped spring system. What could be the reason for this occurrence?\n\n- Some minor typos, for example, page 3: real *worldsystems*, page 4: $\\tau_1,\\tau_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^\\textit{4}$, Theorem 1: The *reversal* loss $\\mathcal{L}_{pred}$, ..."

                "value": "The paper puts forward an interesting motivation when it claims that engaging with Hamiltonian-type neural models might pose too stringent requirements, both on energy preservation as well as on the learning model. The idea of focusing on symmetry/reversibility properties rather than on strict energy preservation requirements is interesting. Even more so if this can be coupled with an approach that is fairly general and computationally efficient to achieve (as it seems reasonable to assume with the proposed approach). The empirical results seems to confirm the claim (though with the limitation described in the weaknesses below)."

                "value": "W1) As highlighted in the \u201cStrengths\u201d part, the motivation of the work is compelling and the idea of addressing reversibility through a simple regularization term is interesting. Unfortunately these are not novel contributions of this paper. Rather they are adapted from Huh et al, NeurIPS 2020, essentially adding the graph NN dimension (which is straightforward extension) and the simplified reversibility regularization with associated theoretical analysis (which is a less straightforward one). Hence my issue here is that the work is perhaps a bit too incremental. \n\nW2) Related with reversibility, I am under the impression that the paper is missing to position the work adequately with respect to some quite relevant related literature on the topic. The topic of reversible neural architectures has a good standing in some quite consolidated works which explicitly study the relationship with stability and non-dissipative diffusion [A]. At the same time, reversible graph flows are discussed when considering generative neural models [B]. More recently, few groups have been studying bracket-based dynamics as way to induce learning models (also on graphs) that mix reversible and irreversible behaviours  [C,D]. These are very relevant related works which deserve to be cited and confronted with both theoretically and empirically, especially as they take a different perspective of inducing provable reversibility as compared to \u201cencouraged reversibility\u201d as in this paper.\n\nW3) The empirical analysis lacks sufficient details for reproducibility. I am missing in the main body (as well as in the appendices) a clear indication of the presence of a validation set, on which for instance one needs to identify the proper \\alpha regularization weight. The empirical analysis itself is not very compelling as it is limited to few simple simulated physical systems. While this is somewhat consistent with some published earlier literature, in more recent works there is the tendency to validate models on more compelling and complex setups, e.g. involving simulation of MuJoCo dynamics or CMU human trajectory data.\n\n[A] Bo Chang et al., Reversible Architectures for Arbitrarily Deep Residual Neural Networks, AAA 2018\n\n[B] Jenny Liu et al, Graph Normalizing Flows, NeurIPS 2019\n\n[C] K.
