Super-resolution tasks not only seek visual improvement but also place great importance on fidelity. Compared methods have better fidelity.

It is vital to find the rule of how BCs affect the results and to propose a method to get a better BC.\n2. The analysis of the paper is mathematically complete. The paper proposes the concept of optimal BC and proves that such an optimal BC is common to different LR images. The conclusion is seemingly solid.\n3. The experiments are sufficient enough to support the theory. The paper claims that the method of obtaining the approximately optimal BS is not related to the degradation model. Experiments on the tasks of bicubic-SR and real-SR demonstrate the assertion. Further ablation studies show the influence of reference set and the set of BCs."

The authors should give more discussions.\n2. The paper assumes that the model is well-trained. However, even a \u201cwell-trained\u201d model cannot fit the real data distribution precisely. Thus, does such an assumption cause potential inaccuracy of the conclusion?\n3. The paper claims that p_\u03b8 (y|h_\u03b8 (x_T,\u03d5)) is approximately uniform. However, what ensures that the model does not have biases when leveraging the \u201cblank token\u201d, which is essentially a placeholder token (that doesn't actually exist)?\n4.

Do the authors think that the method can be leveraged in more general generation tasks such like text-to-image generation?\n2. It seems that the improvement on StableSR (in the task of real-SR) is less than the improvement on SR3 (in the task of bicubic-SR). Could the authors discuss the reasons for this phenomenon?"
