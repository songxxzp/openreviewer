In [1], only one linear layer shows better performance than all existing models in long-term time-series forecasting.

What's the reason? This could provide insight into where the proposed method can provide maximum improvement (and why).\n\n3: The paper mentions that deterministic methods generally don't help with uncertainty quantification, that sets the reader up to seeing uncertainty quantification being addressed by the paper, but it doesn't seem like it has been addressed in text or in experiments.\n\nI'll be happy to revisit my score if the above points are meaningfully addressed."

The model's encoder block consists of a sequence of \"time-freq blocks\" (TFB). Within a single TFB, convolutional and MLP layers act on both the original input in the time domain, as well as the concatenated real and imaginary parts of a Fourier transform of those inputs. TFB are connected with residual connections. The decoder block consists of a series of convolutional layers followed by MLP layers. Model estimation was done via maximum likelihood by minimizing a measure of divergence between observed data samples and samples generated from the model -- though I will say that I am not familiar with the specific estimation methods used, and did not read them carefully. Experiments with forecasting and imputation tasks indicate that the model has performance that is generally comparable to or better than several recently published methods. An ablation study demonstrates that both the time and frequency features are useful."

I do not possess sufficient knowledge of the related literature to fully assess the significance of this contribution, but it has the feeling of an interesting idea that is worth being published.

                "value": "1. I found equations 6 and 7 to be helpful, but they did not seem to align precisely with Figure 1 and did not completely fill out all details of the model. A few specific questions are below:\n\n    a) The text just above Eq 6 defines the operator $g = MLP(SiLU(Conv1D(\\cdot)))$, while Figure 1 and earlier text indicate that Dilated Conv and Conv1d layers were used. Am I understanding correctly that the Dilated Conv and Conv layers in the figure represent the $g$ operator? If so, can this inconsistency be resolved? Otherwise, can the figure or text be amended to address this point of confusion?\n\n    b) I find the layout of the sub-blocks within the TFB on the left side of Figure 1 confusing. The inputs to the DC -> SiLU -> Conv1D block are the time feats or frequency feats, right? This is not apparent to me from the organization of the figure, which has arrows pointing from the DC -> SiLU -> Conv1D block to the time/freq feat modules. And why is there an arrow pointing up from the Conv1D block?\n\n    c) I believe from the figure that $y^l = y^{(l-1)} + TFB(y^{(l-1)} = y^{(l-1)} + f^l_{freq} + f^l_{time}$, but I am not fully confident in this and didn't see a clear statement of this in the text. It would be helpful to add a line to Eq 6 clearly stating how the output of a TFB is calculated.\n\n2. How were missing data values (e.g., as in imputation settings) handled in computation of the FFT?\n\n3. I don't understand the motivation for using a probabilistic score CRPS for a distributional forecast in the short-term forecasting problem, and the MAE/MSE for a point prediction in the long-term forecasting and imputation problems. It seems to me that it would be valuable to examine measures of point forecast skill and distributional forecast skill in both forecasting settings. This is particularly salient since the second sentence of the abstract reads, \"However, existing models primarily focus on deterministic point forecasts, neglecting generative long-term probabilistic forecasting and pre-training models across diverse time series analytic tasks, which are essential for uncertainty quantification and computational efficiency.\" The abstract states that long-term probabilistic forecasting is an important problem, but we do not see CRPS results for the long-term forecasting example. Could a more complete suite of results be added?\n\n4. The ablation study looking at the contribution of time and frequency extraction only looks at a subset of the data sets. I think it would be interesting to provide results for all data sets used in the paper, and to provide some examination to indicate settings in which it is more or less helpful to use both feature sets.  For example, could columns be added to Table 6 giving something like the lag 1 autocorrelation of the series and the power of the first few dominant frequencies? With the hypothesis being that the relative value of using both feature groups may depend on characteristics of the timer series being modeled?"

                "value": "This paper proposed a time-frequency fused parameterization of EBM for long-term time series modeling. The EBM defines a bottom-up mapping which is a encoder architecture as mentioned in this paper. The design of this encoder can be tricky. The author(s) leveraged a novel residual time-frequency block fuse information from time and frequency domain and hence got pretty good results in several benchmarks."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper got good results in several benchmarks but lack of novelty in two ways. If the author claims to improve EBM based learning method in time series, the author should discuss more results about MCMC sampling results, e.g. the chain mixing problem. MCMC chain mixing is a well-known issue in non-sequential signals, it could be worse in time series. If the author claim the novel parameterization of EBM and specially designed fusion block (i.e. the important inductive bias for time series), I would suggest add more insightful ablation studies. There are many design choices for fusion. The author should clarify the benefits of current design choice.\n\nMeanwhile, the author missed some pioneering literature about basic EBM, such as,\n\n[1] \"A theory of generative convnet.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2016.\n\n[2] \"Implicit generation and modeling with energy based models.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 32 (2019).\n\n[3] \"Cooperative training of descriptor and generator networks.\" IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence 42.1 (2018): 27-45.\n\nFor short-run Langevin dynamics learning of EBM, [4] is also an important work.\n\n[4] \"A tale of two flows: Cooperative learning of langevin flow and normalizing flow toward energy-based model.\" ICLR (2022)."
