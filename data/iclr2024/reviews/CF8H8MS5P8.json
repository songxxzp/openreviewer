I am glad to see the authors studying this behaviour. In that sense, the conceptual underpinnings of the paper hold value for the broader ML community. \n\nFurther, I believe that the LLM results are especially compelling. Figure 2 is a nice empirical demonstration of the Paradox. In fact, I was particularly interested in Figure 10 in the Appendix; it is interesting what factors lead human raters to prefer GPT responses over humans. I\u2019d encourage the others to move these findings up to the main text."

                "value": "While I admire the authors\u2019 motivation and their language-centric experiments, I believe that the results for the vision domain are fundamentally flawed. The Paradox hypothesis that the authors raise in Hyp 1 refers to the **same model** being equivalent in generative performance but worse in discriminative performance relative to humans; therefore, I think it is not experimentally sound to have **different** vision models for understanding vs. generation. An adequate investigation into the hypothesis requires having the same model (like the authors did in the language task; e.g., GPT tested on generative and discriminative tasks) rather than one model for generative and (more than one, but different) for discriminative. This discrepancy, I believe, invalidates any of the vision domain results. \n\nHowever, I do not think that this weakness is fatal. I would encourage the authors to focus just on the language domain, unless they procure a vision (or language+vision?) model for which they can study generative and discriminative performance jointly in the same system. If the authors instead focus on just language, I would encourage them to move Fig 10 to the main text (per my note above). At this time, such a chance would be quite major, so I unfortunately recommend rejecting the work. Though, I think the core idea of this paradox, and the language results, warrant further study. \n\nA smaller weakness: the authors are perhaps a bit too flippant about the use of the word \u201cunderstanding\u201d and \u201cintelligence\u201d from a human cognition perspective. I encourage the authors to look into Gardner\u2019s Theory of Multiple Intelligences in particular. This weakness pales in comparison though to the urgency and weight of the first weakness raised.\n\nMore details on the human data used are needed as well (see below)."

Figure 1 doesn't quite capture the difference between the two cases in my opinion.  \nC2.

Adjusting the plot to use alpha values would allow these points to be seen and strengthen the claims supported by the plot. Similar for Figure 8 in the appendix.  \nC3. A handful of concrete outputs would provide further contextualisation for the kind of errors the models are making, as well as give further clarity to the structure of experiments. Figure 1 provides some examples, but additional outputs would be beneficial. Figures 12 to 15 help with this, but the questions/outputs are the same as used in Figure 1.  \n\n**Significance**  \nS1.
