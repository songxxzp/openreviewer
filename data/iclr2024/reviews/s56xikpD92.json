                "value": "This paper proposed a backdoor defence method called BaDExpert. The main motivation is that normal data can be quickly forgotten with finetuning on inconsistent labels, while backdoor data does not. Based on this characteristic, the proposed method can extract a backdoor functionality of the model, which can only correctly classify backdoor data. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively detect and defend against backdoor attacks."

It could be more comprehensive to compare with recent defence methods such as ABL [1], and detection methods [2,3]. \n- The method mainly focuses on the detection of backdoor samples (end of section 3).

                "value": "1 Admitting the effectiveness of the proposed method, I think the practicality of Badexpert is limited. As shown in Appendix A, the optimal learning rate could vary across datasets: ($\\eta=10^{-4}$ for CIFAR-10 and $\\eta=2.5\\cdot10^{-5}$ for GTSRB). Even for the same dataset,  the optimal $\\eta$ could be different across different architectures:   $\\eta=10^{-4}$ for ResNet18 and  $\\eta=10^{-6}$ for pretrained vit_b_16. Considering the tremendous hyperparameter required for Badexpert, I think the overall guidlines for how to choose hyperparameter are needed to help Badexpert better defend against  potential risks.\n\n2 BadExpert depends on the stong mapping from the trigger to the pre-defined behaviour. I firmly believe, as long as the backdoor attack is weak enough (decreasing the poison rate/ the size of trigger/ the blend rate), will potentially leads to the Badexpert unsuccessful.  Sincerely, I hope to further discuss with the authors when encountering the above situations. Table 10 shows parts of the results, but not enough from my view. In addition, I think ASR and CA is a more appropriate metric to indicate the performance of BaDExpert instead of AUROC: Combing Table 1 and Table 2, BaDExpert obtains 11.4% ASR against blend attack. However, the AUROC is 99.2% which is quite close to 100%.\n\n3 The chosen of hyperparemter $\\eta'$ could also be unpractical in real world. In reality, only the small subset of clean images is available for defenders. Therefore, they have little knowledge about which $\\eta'$will meets the requirement of Badexpert: the CA of the finetuned model's CA first drops to ~ $0\\%$ and recovers to a significant value in the following epochs. The defender dooesn't exactly know what the CA of current model is. Therefore, the requirement of Badexpert may be too ideal.\n\n4 Some of the baselines are missing. For example, AWM [1] and ABL [2]."
