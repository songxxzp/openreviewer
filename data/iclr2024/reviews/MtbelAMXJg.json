                "value": "The paper proposes a pruning framework called Invariance Unveiling Neural Networks (IUNET) that automatically discovers invariance-preserving subnetworks from deep and dense supernetworks. The framework combines pruning with a novel invariance learning objective to improve the network's inductive bias. In particular, the training objective minimizes the distance between representations of inputs under invariant perturbations for the supernetwork such that the pruned subnetwork architecture captures the invariance. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms existing methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness on both vision and tabular datasets."

This work only emphasizes on the architecture, but there are no discussions on weights. I am doubtful of the claim (hypothesis) that the subnetwork after retraining \"preserves desired invariances and hence improves the inductive bias\" and I wonder if this is empirically the case. \n\n- There lacks a justification or analysis on how pruning of architecture is able to achieve for certain transformation groups. The mechanisms of transformations on the values of input tensors (e.g. colour) should apparently be different from the transformations on the domain (e.g. translation and rotation).\n\n- Rotation, as one of the most explored transformation in the literature of invariant/equivariant deep learning, is however not included in the study of this work.\n\n- A couple of details in the experimental setup are not clear enough, and those will highly affect understanding the effectiveness of the proposed method.

And if re-trained is ILO or augmentation used in training? As I mentioned, the inductive bias of invariance / equivariance does not only exist in the architecture but also in the shared weights. So if the IUNet weights are re-initialised then the results are too good to be true, otherwise an unfair comparison.\n\n- Also in table 3 and 4, what transformations are used?\n\n- In table 4, what if data augmentation is applied to all models, no matter with and without ILO? I wonder how ILO can improve over simple augmentation (especially with a pruned model trained without ILO)\n\n- Why in fig2(e) ILO is better than IUNet?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Here are my main concerns.\n\n1. The authors try to find the invariance-preserving network \"via network pruning\", but the proposed ILO could also be applied to just desne networks without network pruning. In this sense, there seems to be a lack of motivation as to why network pruning is necessary for obtaining an invariance-preserving network. Additionally, with magnitude-based one-shot pruning, a method simply based on parameter magnitude will be very sensitive to initialization. To alleviate this, more robust methods for initialization, such as SNIP and GraSP, have been proposed, but in this paper, there is no discussion or experiment on how sensitive to initialization.\n\n2. It seems that many presentations of the paper should be revised. For example, in Section 3.2, the explanation for relations of parameters of supernetwork and subnetwork are quite confusing. Since $\\theta_P^{(0)}$ and $\\theta_M^{(T)}$ are parameter \"vectors\", hence the set inclusion operation is not suitable. Also, the expression $|\\theta_P^{(0)}| < |\\theta_M^{(T)}|$ does not imply that $\\theta_P^{(0)}$ is more sparse than $\\theta_M^{(T)}$, which does not give any information about the network capacity. Rather, the authors should express the sparsity or network capacity via $\\ell_0$-norm (number of non-zeros, nnz). In the same sense, in Section 3.2.1, it seems difficult to say that the higher weight value of criterion (3) is a criterion of network capacity. Even if the parameter value is small, if it is non-zero, it will eventually be counted in the FLOPs calculation, so (for example) the number of non-zeros should be used rather than weight magnitude.\n\n3. In the case of proactive initialization (PI), it is as if only the parameter size was simply adjusted, but looking at the results in Figure 3, the parameters were initialized small with $\\kappa = 0.125$. It is natural that the result of $\\kappa = 0.125$ has many weights with smaller values. There needs to be some mathematical evidence or experimental results for proactive initialization that can further demonstrate motivation and reasoning about it.\n\n4. It is true that IUNet shows good performance in various experimental results, but it is difficult to interpret Figure 4 that the weights have any pattern. In this sense, I recommend that the authors consider a slightly larger size network parameter or describe more details about which parts are different between the first row and the second row in Figure 4."
