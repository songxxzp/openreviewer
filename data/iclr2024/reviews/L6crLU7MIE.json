The problem arises as these scores reflect collective outcomes, making it difficult to ascertain individual agents' contributions, especially in real-world scenarios with fixed group sizes, incomplete datasets, and fully anonymized data.\n\n### Main Contributions\nThe key contributions include\n1. The introduction of \"Exchange Values\" (EVs) to quantify an individual agent's contribution to collective desirability.\n2. The proposal of \"EV-Clustering\" to estimate these values from incomplete datasets\n3. The development of \"Exchange Value based Behavior Cloning\" (EV2BC), a method that selectively imitates agents with high EVs estimated from anonymized data, thus aligning learned policies with desired characteristics, outperforming relevant baselines.\n\n### Methodology\nThe authors propose \"Exchange Values\", a modification to Shapley value computation that compares the Desired Value Function values between agent groups of the same size, making it amenable to games that have group size constraints. Based on the Exchange Values, clustering of agents can be done by maximizing inter-cluster EV variance, which is particularly useful for fully-anonymized data. Behavior cloning (BC) can be then confined to only mimicking agents with high Exchange Values.\n\n### Experiments\nTwo environments are used to evaluate the methods, namely the \"Tragedy of Commons\" and \"Overcooked\". Both synthesized and human generated data are used. The experiments show that the estimated EV values are meaningful and superior BC performance is attained with the guidance of EV for selecting trajectories to imitate."

It would be interesting to see analysis of Exchange Values with respect to these properties.\n\n### Lack of interpretation of EV\nMore detailed analysis can be added to the main text with respect to how different EV values can be connected to various behavior patterns. In particular, I think the $\\lambda$ values in both \"Tragedy of Commons\" and \"Overcooked\" can be linked to the estimated EVs to validate the method.\n\n### Lack of baseline\nI understand that this is the first work tackling this specific problem setup, but I'm interested to see whether Shapley values could be similarly useful for guiding imitation learning in multi-agent dataset when the group size constraint is absent (which should be possible in many cases, e.g. the Tragedy of the Commons).\n\n### Writing\nAlthough I in general enjoyed reading the paper, I still find many sentences throughout the article a bit repetitive and convoluted."

                "value": "The paper \"Who to Imitate: Imitating Desired Behavior from Diverse Multi-Agent Datasets\" proposes a novel imitation learning framework. It enables AI agents to learn desirable behaviors from large, mixed-quality multi-agent datasets by using a metric called Exchange Value (EV) to evaluate and imitate only those agents contributing positively to collective outcomes. The technique involves EV-Clustering to handle incomplete data and an Exchange Value based Behavior Cloning (EV2BC) method for learning policies aligned with desired outcomes. The approach is shown to outperform baselines and has applications in aligning AI behavior with human values in complex environments."

                "value": "Innovative Metric for Agent Evaluation: The introduction of Exchange Values (EVs) as a metric to compute individual agents' contributions to a collective value function is a significant contribution. EVs offer a method for identifying and imitating desirable behaviors within multi-agent systems, providing a novel way to approach imitation learning.\n\nEffective Handling of Incomplete Data: The paper presents EV-Clustering, a method that estimates contributions from incomplete datasets. This addresses a common challenge in real-world scenarios where datasets are rarely comprehensive, enabling more accurate modeling of agent behavior.\n\nAlignment with Desirable Outcomes: Through Exchange Value based Behavior Cloning (EV2BC), the paper proposes a mechanism to align the learning process with a Desired Value Function (DVF). This ensures that the learned policies reflect desirable outcomes, which is crucial for the practical application of AI systems trained on human data."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. **Quantification of Desirability**: The process of quantifying the desired value function (DVF) is a complex task and an active area of research. The paper's methods depend on the DVF to guide the imitation learning process, so any limitations in accurately defining this function could impact the effectiveness of the approach.\n\n2. **Assumption of Consistent Agent Behavior**: The framework assumes that individual agents behave similarly across multiple trajectories. This assumption may not always hold true in complex, dynamic environments where agent behavior can vary significantly based on context.\n\n3. **Utilization of Undesired Behavior Data**: The paper points out that further research could explore how to utilize data on undesired behavior more effectively, such as developing policies that are explicitly constrained to avoid undesirable actions."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Given that the quantification of what is considered desirable behavior is central to the proposed framework, can the authors provide additional insights into how the Desired Value Function (DVF) is defined and quantified across different environments and datasets?\n\n2. The paper assumes consistent behavior from individual agents across multiple trajectories. Could the authors discuss the potential implications of this assumption in environments where agent behavior is more dynamic and context-dependent?\n\n3. The paper suggests the potential for utilizing data on undesired behavior more effectively. Could the authors elaborate on possible approaches for leveraging this type of data to enhance the imitation learning process?\n\n4. How does the framework adapt to different environments, and what are the limitations when applying the proposed EV-Clustering and EV2BC methods to datasets that significantly differ from the ones used in the experiments?"
