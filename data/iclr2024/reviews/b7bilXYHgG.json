The paper claims that existing works that rely on inferring latent variables may hurt prediction performance by introducing bias, and it argues the proposed method can mitigate such an issue. However, learning counterfactual distribution is often more challenging than generating counterfactual samples, and it can also be hard to stabilize the training of GAN. Although the paper empirically shows on synthetic data that the proposed method can attain a better utility-fairness trade-off than baselines, it is unclear how it performs in more complicated settings."

The goal is to insure for any individual that the outcome would be the same if the individual has a different value of a sentifive attribute (e.g., gender). As many attributes of the individual can be influenced by the sensitive, it implies to build a mechanism to imagine how the individual would look like for the other - counterfactual - sensitive value. Authors of the paper propose to build on a GAN architecture, which has already been employed for that purpose, but in a different way where the approach was to generate causal and interventional data, from which counterfactual fairness could be achieved. The proposed approach is more simple, proposing to generating a counterfactual representation of individual more directly, with a specific min max objective."

Authors should at least mention that most cited approaches (e.g. Grari et al.2023) have regularizers that seek at removing these correlations. I cannot see why the proposed approach would be really better on that point, as I feel the discriminator makes some similar job as, for instance, VAE with adversarial loss that seek at reducing mutual information between the latent and the sensitive of these approaches. \n\n2. One mentioned limitation of VAE is \"It is commonly assumed that the prior distribution of latent variables follows a standard Gaussian in VAEs\", that would hinder the prediction ability. While I agree that VAE is more constrained than GAN since there is a need for choosing a distribution family that strongly affects the results if is does not well fit the data, this problem is about the decoding distribution, not the encoding one, as having a latent space structured using a gaussian is something usually desirable. Note that GAN also use a  sampling from a standard gaussian in the latent space... What do you think ?   \n\n3. CFGAN: In appendix B3, authors point out than one of the main difference with CFGAN is that this approach only achieves interventional fairness, not counterfactual. From my point of view this is not true since, as explained in their section 3.5 counterfactual samples are generated by 1) generating samples from the causal model  2) selecting the z that led to the generation of a given class of the sensitive and finally 3) generate a new sample for each selected z, by interventioning on the sensitive, to get a counterfactual sample for each of them. Thus, a predictor can be learned on that data, with a regularization that ensures that both versions of individual lead to similar outputs. It is countefactual fairness as every varariables depending on the sensitive can be impacted. That is not only P(Y|X,do(A=a))=P(Y|X,do(A=a') since X and Y are regenerated after intervention (using the same z in factual and interventional world allows to follow the counterfactual fairness objective that is mentioned in the paper).          \n\nSoundness of the objectives\n\n1. Authors consider a causal graph where X->A, but suggest in fig1 that there can exist some correlations between X and A, implying some cofounder that causes both. If there are in the data distribution for instance more old women than old men, and assuming Y is lower for women than for men, then I suspect that the regularization term in (7) cannot have any strong impact on that bias. X remains the same for factual and counterfactual, only M changes, which can be ignored by h if most of the information for outputting Y is in X. Please discuss that remark. \n\n2. I am surprised to see that the proposed adversarial objective is greatly asymmetric, as it never considers counterfactuals produced for individuals from the A=1 class. The adversarial loss is indeed weighted by A for the factual part and 1-A for the counterfactual one (which is 0 in the case A=1). Denoting as M_{i,j} the output of the generator for an individual from class i and intervention using j as the sensitive value, we M_1,1 steered toward M from Lf and far from M from Ladv; M_0,1   steered toward M from Ladv; M_1,0   steered toward M from Lf; and M_1,0 is totally free... Isn't it a problem ? I suspect that it can report most of the fairness effort on the A=0 class. Also, I am not sure if this does correspond to a well-defined optimization problem since there may exist many equivalent optima, no ? having M_1,1 = M   looks very likely at the end of the optimization (with G  outputting a very different value for M_1,0 which is unconstrained).  \n\n\nExperiments\n\n1. Comparative experiments are performed on semi-synthetic datasets, where we can get both factual and counterfactual versions of the data. However, I feel that the generative process that are considered are too easy to fully analyze, as 1) there is not correlation between X and A (which can be unfair regarding the previous remarks above) and 2) M is deterministically deduced from X and A, which appears as a really easy setting : First,  authors show in table 1 that counterfactual M can be generated accurately from their generator. However, this is not fully convincing (and does not reassure me about the asymmetry issue mentioned above), as it is easy to fully understand the relation between (X,A) and M only from samples from the 0 class (A=0). M_A' is well generated for the class A=1 thanks to this, but I am really not sure that is would applied in more difficult settings. Second, for such a setting we could design a very simpler approach that learn h(X,A) to be close to Y while limiting the distance between h(X,A) and h(X,A'), which would be at least as effective. \n\n2. Comparison with competitors only performed on semi-synthetic- not fully convincing - datasets. I know that countefactual fairness is difficult to fully evaluate, but wouldn't it be possible to conduct some analysis on the results of some competitors also, to see if there is impact of the improvements observed on synthetic data ? \n\n3. To be fully self-contained and reproducible, as every competitor has many variants inside their paper, with sometimes non trivial application for the considered setting, it would be nice to have in appendix the pseudo-code of each of the considered approach, at least ADVAE and CFGAN.      \n\nMinor : the \",\" should be replaced by a \"-\" in every regularization (7) or metric (9) formulations."
