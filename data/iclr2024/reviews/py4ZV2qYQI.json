                "value": "The paper addresses federated learning with hybrid tabular data, where data from different parties may differ both in the features\nand samples. The common framework for this kind of settings is federated learning using gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT). However, existing solutions suffer from high communication and computation overhead. The paper introduces HybridTree, a GBDT-based approach with some clever design. The higher layers of a HybridTree follows a standard GBDT design, exploring host features. The lower layers of the HybridTree are distributed among the guests. This is a form of bagging where each guest contributes one tree to the bag, utilising only the local data of the guest. At each HybridTree training iteration, there are $k$ bags corresponding to $k$ endpoints of the host (sub)tree.\nExperiments on simulated and natural hybrid federated datasets show that the HybridTree can be up to 8 times faster than existing approaches, while maintaining the level of accuracy close to when all data are not protected by privacy and low communication overhead."

The first part of the paper consists of a demonstration of the existence and abundance of meta rules in federated learning using GBDT, which provides clues about where to improve upon existing approaches, and the theoretical contribution, i.e. theorem 2 and 3, albeit being rather simple and straightforward from the mathematical point of view, provides an interesting view on how the following HybridTree algorithm tackles the inefficiency of existing approaches.\n\nThe second part of the paper, the introduction of the HybridTree algorithm, in my view is a clever and efficient use of boosting and bagging under the context of privacy preserving of federated learning. HybridTree is like 2D boosting with 1 dimension resembling GBDT addressing global (host) data, and with the other dimension spanning across local (guest) data, eliminating guest-guest communications and mitigating guest-host communications.\n\nExperiments on both simulated and hybrid federated datasets are appear adequate for the problem that the paper addresses, with results favouring HybridTree with reasonable gaps over existing approaches."

                "value": "I only have a few minor complaints about presentation, which makes it difficult to follow in the first read:\n\n1. Definition 1 needs revising. At the beginning $S$ is defined as an intersection of split conditions but at the end you have split conditions not in $S$. It is intuitively understandable but it is mathematically incorrect.\n\n2. In Figure 2b, you could have mentioned that $(L'_1, L'_2, L'_3, L'_4)$ can be $(L_1, L_2, L_1, L_3)$ as an example, and the audience would understand Theorem 2 better.\n\n3. I did not understand theorem 3 at first. How does a meta rule that \"ended by $F_g$ differ from a meta rule where $F_g$ is the last layer? Aren't they the same thing? Does the intersection operator here suggest ordering as well? After reading the proof of theorem 3, I understood what the author(s) meant. In any path from the root node to a leaf node, there is a possibility that a guest split condition stays above a host split condition, you just want transform the tree so that such possibility does not exist, is that right? If so, I suggest to restate theorem 3 in a way that is more understandable.\n\n4. What has caught me a surprise is that theorem 3 is not used in a conventional way. Instead of using theorem 3 to improve upon a given tree, the authors redesign a new tree where guest split conditions are always below host split conditions. This is a good point that appears to have been presented somewhat lightly in the paper.\n\n5. In my view, the flow of the paper could better if the authors presented the HybridTree inference before presenting the HybridTree training. Once the audience knows how inference works, the training components make much more sense."

First of all,  it is unclear in the hybrid setting considered, what are the relative relations of the guest parties? In the introduction, it appears that they share the same feature space but have different sample IDs, however, in 3.1 they appear to have different dimensions and unclear alignment. It is suggested that the paper properly define the problem setting. A figure on how data is partitioned by different parties would also help.  Secondly, the algorithm is very messy with many undefined variables and notations, making it also hard to process. It is also not clear how features from different guests are used in a collaborative manner in the approach due to the above issues on presentation. \n\n2. The experimental results are biased. 1) The paper compares its model performance using data from multiple guests against FedTree and Pivot using data from one guest, therefore the model performance gap is largely due to the utilization of additional data parties, not to the benefits of the algorithm. To be fair, the paper should compare them under the same settings, that is, multiple guests and host. 2) Important baselines such as Secureboost[1] is missing.  3) the model performance of the proposed methods still appear to be \na little inferior to the centralized setting, not exactly \"comparable\" as claimed. It is important to understand whether the proposed method is \"lossless\" or \"lossy\" and why. I think more detailed examinations and explanations are needed here. \n\n[1] Cheng, Tao Fan, Yilun Jin, Yang Liu, Tianjian Chen, Dimitrios Papadopoulos, and Qiang Yang.
