            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "An important point I see with this submission is that it does not seem to be aware of the wide array of papers that use Helmholtz and curl constructions from the fields of deep learning and from the computer graphics. As the paper already targets CG-like flows, and cites several works from this area, I have trouble understanding why the authors have omitted all the classic works from this area.\n\nHowever, most important of course are directly relevant DL papers, that have used very similar constructs. The classic \"Accelerating eulerian fluid simulation with convolutional networks\" Tompson et al. ICML 2017 uses it in the loss,  and \"Deep fluids: A generative network for parameterized fluid simulations\" Kim et al. 2019 use it for inferring flow solutions, very closely related to the paper here. \n\nMany newer papers likewise use curl constructions, e.g. \"Curl-Flow: Pointwise Incompressible Velocity Interpolation forGrid-Based Fluids\" Chang et al. 2021, and \"Discovering Hidden Physics Behind Transport Dynamics\" Liu et al. 2021. Also closely related, just last year at ICLR 3D flows were synthesized using a multi-scale architecture with curl: \"Learning to Estimate Single-View Volumetric Flow Motions without 3D Supervision\"  Franz et al. 2023. None of these papers are cited, or compared to. This is a big omission, and leaves many questions open. Most importantly, whether there are any gains from the proposed approach over these already published works.\n\nIn addition, I would recommend citing and acknowledging the classic CG papers: Bridson's curl-noise paper, and derivatives such as \"Stream function solver for liquid simulations\" Ando et. al 2015. Beyond this, the related work in terms of works from the DL field focusing on fluids also looks like it could be broadened and improved.\n\nBeyond the unclear advantages, I was also surprised that the paper focuses on extremely short prediction horizons. 10 steps do not seem like a state of the art for current DL-based simulators. I think it will be important to target much longer roll-outs in order to keep up with existing works. (I would expect the higher order time integration methods to relatively quickly cause trouble in these cases.)\n\nIn general, the appendix is quite sparse w.r.t. additional details. I think future revisions of the submission could also be improved by providing further ablations and details here."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "It is not intuitive to me why the Helmholtz decomposition should be enforced throughout the network, and on multiple scales. In the end, only the final output should adhere to this, and I would expect it to overly constrain the inner latent spaces of a network. Have the authors tried adding only a single layer at the end?\n\nIt's crucial for a fair comparison to keep the number of network parameters similar. Why have the authors chosen to vary them so widely? There's a factor of 20x between smallest and largest in Table 9. Along those lines, 10m for a 64x64 flow seem huge. I would recommend to add an ablation for different sizes.\n\n---\n\nPost-rebuttal comments:\n\nI want to thank the authors for the updates and their replies. However, I really cant understand why the authors are trying to argue that their \"task\" is not the simulation of a fluid, but rather an inverse problem of inferring velocities from some observed state. To quote the abstract \"we propose the HelmSim toward an accurate and interpretable simulator for fluid\" , and the main body continues like this. If the goal of the paper is really _not_ the simulation of fluids, but some derived inverse task, I would recommend to reflect this in introduction and the presentation of the method and rewrite them accordingly. However, if the goal is simulating fluids after all, I think it's important how the method fares for actual simulation tasks using velocities and central input output quantity (instead of only focusing on velocity estimation tasks). \n\nI do evaluate this paper based on its currently stated objectives, i.e. simulating fluids, and for this 10 steps are clearly not sufficient. Current learning-based methods typically focus on hundreds or thousands of steps. As such, I will keep my score. I don't think this paper should be published at ICLR in its current form, but would require some fundamental revisions that should be carefully checked by reviewers.\n\nTable 12 also contains the stream only / curl only versions. I think future versions of the paper should make clear that \"curl only\" is widely used in the DL community already. Being very close to the full version, this seems to give the majority of the gains."

Why would HelmSim be at the lower end of the spectrum then? Especially since it's the second slowest model in runtime. \n6. The number of parameters is different between each model, it would make sense to make a fair comparison where the same number of parameters was provided for each model. In this particular case, FNO was provided roughly 9x less parameters to train on. The number of parameters should ideally also be mentioned in the main text.\n7.

Is this interpretation correct?\n3. In the experimental results, the authors mention that the blurry predictions from U-Net \"impede its practicability\". In what application areas will these models be applied? \n4. The argument for why directly estimating the velocity will overwhelm the model in the ablation study is not very convincing.

                "value": "- Source of Improvement and Ablation Study:\n  - Given the presence of various complex architectural choices, it's difficult to determine whether the Helmholtz decomposition is the primary source of the observed performance improvement. Notably, the absence of the multi-head mechanism leads to a performance drop (0.1261 -> 0.1344) for the 64x64 Navier-Stokes, which is somewhat comparable to the performance decrease resulting from the ablation of the Helmholtz decomposition (0.1261 -> 0.1412). These results raise questions about the model's overall performance gain compared to the baseline models when the multi-head trick is absent. Additionally, the ablation studies need to be explained more comprehensively with sufficient details, as the current presentation makes it difficult to understand the methodology and outcomes.\n  - The paper claims that Vortex (Deng et al., 2023) cannot be tested on other datasets, which seems unusual, as they are the same type of task and data that are disconnected from the choice of dynamics modeling itself. It should be further clarified why Vortex cannot be applied to other datasets.\n- Interpretability Claim:\n  - The paper's claim about interpretability is not well-explained. If the interpretability claim is based on the model's prediction of an explicit term of velocity, it needs further comparison and a more comprehensive explanation. Does the Helmholtz decomposition significantly improve interpretability compared to baseline models, such as Vortex (Deng et al., 2023)?\n  - In Figure 4, it appears that the model predicts incoherent velocity fields around the circle boundary, even with non-zero velocity outside the boundary, while baseline models do not exhibit such artifacts. This weakens the interpretability claim.\n- Multiscale modeling: \n  - The aggregation operation after \"Integration\" needs further clarification. Please provide more details in the main paper, and if you refer to other architectures, acknowledge their structure properly.\n- Regarding some missing experimental results with cited baselines, it's crucial to include and report all baseline results to ensure transparency, even if the outcomes are considered inferior.\n- Minor issues: \n  - Ensure proper citation format for baseline models (Authors, Year).\n  - Make sure that symbols are well-defined with clear reference to their definitions. For example, in Equation (4), the undefined operator $\\mathbb{I}_{\\vec r\\in\\mathbb{S}}$ needs clarification.

The error map looks similar except for a narrow region. What is the L2 error with and without the Helmholtz dynamics? What is the computational overhead for training with Helmholtz dynamics? Moreover, the error map looks the same for including and not including the boundary condition terms, making it hard to understand the benefits of including the boundary terms.  Can you also include the ablation study for the multihead, multiscale structure of your proposed model to demonstrate their effects?\n\n5. The author mentioned that 3D fluid field is hard to observe, so they focus on the 2D cases, which is a false statement. There are many advanced techniques to observe the 3D fluid fields like PIV. It is more like the limitation of the current method that only works on 2D cases."
