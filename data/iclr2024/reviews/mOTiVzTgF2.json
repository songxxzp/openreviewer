                "value": "The paper proposes a novel Transformer architecture named ResiDual to explore the optimal way implementing residual connections in Transformer. There are two widely used methods in the literature: Post-Layer-Normalization (Post-LN) and Pre-Layer-Normalization (Pre-LN). However, they suffer from either the gradient vanishing issue or the collapse issue. The paper combines the two LN ideas and designs an architecture with Pre-Post-Layer-Normalization. Basically, the new proposed architecture has two parallel lines, one for Post-LN and the other for Pre-LN. The two lines share the same self-attention block. The authors claim that this architecture can avoid the aforementioned limitations. They first give a theoretical analysis, and then conduct experiments on several data sets. They show that the new architecture can outperform baseline methods on benchmarks, like IWSLT-14, WMT, and OPUS-100."

Their derivations of theorem 3.1 ignore the impact of non-linearity on the gradient of the transformer MLP layer, instead assuming it to be a single FC. \n1. The derivation also ignores back-propagated gradient through the Query - while Keys will not back-propagate any gradient as Query is zero-initialized, Query will have non-zero gradient back-propagating.\n1. As the improvements can sometimes be small (For eg. 27.65 vs 27.3 in Table 3), some measure of statistical significance of the improvements is required.\n1. Discussion of prior work is somewhat lacking - while the authors reference prior works throughout the text, a dedicated section for more detailed discussion is missing.\n1. The discussion of Adam condition number assumes very very small values of gradient, which is not observed realistically. This discussion should be contextualized given realistic values of the gradient."

See details below on the exact code I used. The plot I observed does not look anything like what Equation(2) would suggest - it seems perhaps exponential for shallow layers, but definitely not logarithmic.\n2. For experiments in Table 2, 3, and 4, did the authors only run a single run, or were the experiments repeated multiple times with varying hyper-parameters? How was this hyper-parameter search performed? The dropout and LR (from Table 9,10, 11) are different for these tables.\n    1. So if a hyper-parameter search was performed, was the same search performed for all the baselines?\n3. Figure 3 in the appendix shows the condition number upto $\\sigma_g$ upto $10^{-7}$ - what is the realistic range of $\\sigma_g$? On experimenting with standard BERT-large model, I found $\\sigma_g$ at initialization was < $10^{-4}$ for 0.3% of params, and even < $10^{-3}$ for 4% of params. How is the Adam condition number at these (somewhat more-realistic) lower values of  $\\sigma_g$, and how does Figure 3(left) change?\n\n\n\nCode for gradient norm of Pre-LN - \nUsing a sample LM code from huggingface from [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.31.0/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_clm_no_trainer.py), I added ` config.n_layer = 48` at line 390 to increase the number of layers.

Compare the ResiDual model not only with standard Transformer variants but also with recent SOTA models that address similar issues."
