Such implementation approach is pretty standard when deploying ML solutions in practice, and is tackling the software development portion of the application stack, not ML. Also, from the software implementation perspective the contribution is not very innovative, as other deployments usually use pipelined approached with model ensembles, loops and gating mechanisms when deciding what models to invoke.\n2) The evaluation section is not comprehensive enough. The method should be compared with other techniques and not pipelined systems to justify the claims. Also, the abstract specifies that the inference time and mAP were improved, but it's not presented anywhere in the results section."

One research direction could be creating edge-efficient ML architectures. Besides that, there are various techniques for making networks more suitable for edge devices, like quantization. I believe that contributing to that would be more impactful for the community like ICLR."

To make your claims stronger, you should add some references on the statements being valid in Section 1. \n4. You used very generalized words in section 1 that you will be using an AI based pipeline.

Section 2: Please add more research works. \n7. I see a mixture of past and present tense in the sentences (For instance, in Section 1, 2). Also I saw using comma instead of full-stop in numbers (as decimals) (For instance, in Section 2). I would suggest you proofread the paper again.\n8.

Weakness #5: You should add a few samples of the data.\n10. \u201cThe goal for firearm detection was to achieve a mean average precision of (mAP) of at least 80 %.\u201d - Is there any specific reason behind the number 80%? If yes, please mention it in paper.\n11. It is not mentioned how much computational power is actually being taken by each YOLO model, in the device, and why you choose one specifically.        \n12.
