                "value": "This paper achieves high-quality object-level image editing through a simple yet effective method. Authors find that the editing for different parts requires different noising levels used to inverse the given image to latent space. As such, they search for optimal inversion steps for different parts based on a search metric for both the edited and non-edited regions respectively. In order to produce a natural final result, the results of different parts are seamlessly blended, which yields a harmonic and globally coherent editing output. Albeit its simplicity, the proposed method outperforms competitive works when editing real images and shows promise in real usage."

Both the quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the advantage over strong prior works. \n\n- Since the denoising process of different image parts is disentangled, the proposed method supports fine-grained multiple object editing, which is not featured in prior works.  \n\n- The parallel denoising strategy effectively reduces the search speed."

Moreover, in the paper, it is suggested to report the image editing speed for different methods since some other baselines, like prompt-to-prompt, can edit images in a feed-forward manner. \n\n- Some writing parts can be improved for better clarity. For example, what's the detailed formulation of min-max normalization? It is suggested to better rephrase the term \"concept mismatch\".\n\n- Since the re-inversion step is always set to 20% of the total steps, the non-edit regions will inevitably be affected.

The search process can be very time consuming. as it requires denoising from each inversion step, plus a metric calculation step. The overall amount of computation for a single image editing task can thus be very large.\n\n2. It relies on SAM to do fine-grained segmentation of the input image to localize the object, and then do localized editing followed by resembling. However, it has some limitations. For example, the segmentation may not work well for small object. In addition, using SAM constrained the edit to object-level, while the applicability of more global change is questionable (e.g., change the style of an image from spring to winter, change the background to Mars, etc.). It may not be able to change the location of an object. \n\n3. Related to above point, the competitive method, such as null-text inversion, does not involve segmentation and localization, therefore it is a bit unfair to compare with them, as in principle they can only benefit from the segmentation and localization. This is independent from the main innovation of this paper, which is searching for optimal inversion step.\n\n4. Overall, it is a method that combines multiple existing component, with significant increase in compute. Therefore, the contribution and significance of the method is limited."

Additionally, it is observed that neglecting the varying difficulty levels of different editing pairs in multi-object editing tasks results in the problems of concept mismatch and poor editing. To address these issues, the paper introduces a novel training-free image editing approach called OIR. This method follows the approach of assembly first and then reassembly. 1) In the assembly strategy, the paper introduces a novel search metric. This metric automatically identifies the optimal inversion step for different editing pairs, enabling automatic control of editing difficulty. This approach allows different editing pairs to undergo separate denoising, preventing concept mismatch issues. Moreover, employing the search metric to find the optimal result represents a new paradigm in single-object editing. 2) In the reassembly strategy, the article suggests merging the editing regions and non-editing region during the reassembly step. This operation takes place in the denoise latent space. The reassembly process incorporates a re-inversion strategy, enhancing the image editing's edge smoothness, improving image editability, and enabling interaction across regions. 3) To assess OIR's capabilities, the authors collect two datasets, which are employed to evaluate both the single-object editing proficiency of the search metric and the multi-object editing capability of OIR. Numerous experimental results indicate that the search metric performs on par with existing state-of-the-art editing methods in single-object editing tasks. Moreover, in multi-object editing tasks, OIR demonstrates strong performance, outperforming the previous SOTA methods"
