Intuitively, if you have a perfect teacher model, you can use it directly to calculate graph embeddings. Is it necessary to design such complicated contrastive learning losses to distill from the teacher model? The teacher-student model is originally designed to distill knowledge from large models and inject into small models, however, in this paper, the purpose of teacher-student is not to reduce the model size.\n\n2. The performance of the student model is theoretically bounded by the teacher model. I'm curious why the propose model TGCL-DSLA can perform better than the teacher DSLA and GraphLoG?\n\n3. For graph classification task, the datasets are all on molecule properties, which is quite limited. It is better to add more types of graph classification tasks to see how the proposed model performs on various type of graphs.\n\n4. From Table 1, most experimental results do not show significant improvement over baselines.\n\n4. According to Figure 4, why the proposed TGCL-DSLA learns the best graph embedding? It is hard to see the difference between (a) and (c)."

                "value": "**Concern 1. Why can the student model trained by TGCL outperform the teacher model on the downstream tasks?**\n\nTGCL primarily relies on the semantic similarity (soft label) provided by the teacher model in a knowledge distillation manner. In general distillation settings (e.g. model compression via distillation), the performance (or generalization capacity) of the student model is usually upper bounded by the teacher model. \n\nThus, I wonder why TGCL-student outperforms the teacher model? Which part of the algorithm contributes to the performance / information gain over the teacher model? \n\n\n\n**Concern 2. Is TGCL sensitive to the pretraining method of the teacher model?**\n\nAs shown in Table 1, TGCL-analogues do not consistently reach the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Does TGCL exclusively apply to teacher models trained using specific pretraining methods, such as GraphLog and D-SLA?\n\nIf TGCL can enhance teacher models trained by any algorithm, could it serve as an iterative evolutionary paradigm? For instance, a teacher model undergoes k epochs of pretraining, followed by k epochs of TGCL updates, and this process repeats until convergence.\n\n\n\n**Concern 3: Does TGCL's performance depend on the quality of the teacher model?**\n\nAs TGCL heavily relies on the semantic similarity of teacher embeddings, I wonder to what extent the performance of TGCL relies on the representation quality of the teacher model\n\nIntuitively, obtaining a proficient teacher model is as challenging as achieving high-quality unsupervised representations. If TGCL only works with a well-trained teacher models, it may not address unsupervised representation learning directly. Instead,  it serves as an incremental improvement to existing effective unsupervised pretraining methods.\n\n\n\n**Concern 4: Does TGCL work when the teacher model overfits to the pretraining domain?**\n\nIf the teacher model fits the pretraining dataset well (or, \u2018overfits the pretraining distribution\u2019), it may encode domain-specific biases that hinder out-of-domain generalization. In this scenario, does it harm the downstream performance of the student model? What aspect of TGCL can help mitigate pretraining bias and enhance downstream generalization?"
