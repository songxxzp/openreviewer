                "value": "Sinkhorn is a popular algorithm for calculating entropic-regularised OT distances. However, before applying the Sinkhorn algorithm to the discrete probability measures, one should first draw a large stream of data from the probability distributions. This situation has been improved by online Sinkhorn method, which continuously samples data from two probability distributions in batches and iteratively computes the results. This paper revisits the recently introduced online Sinkhorn algorithm of $Mensch\\ \\& \\ Peyre \\ (2020)$ and rises two improvements. \n\n1. This work presents a new convergence rate for the the online Sinkhorn algorithm, which is faster than the previous rate under certain parameter choices.\n\n2. Under two new assumptions, the authors propose the compressed online Sinkhorn algorithm which combines measure compression techniques with the online Sinkhorn algorithm. Under certain parameter values, the new algorithm theoretically has a faster speed and smaller error than the previous online Sinkhorn algorithm.\n\nThe authors also provide experimental results to show the numerical gains of these two improvements."

Real-world data often has a high dimensionality (such as datasets of images and amino acid sequences), but the authors do not discuss cases where $d > 5$. In \\textbf{section A.5.2}, for data of dimension $d$, the compression error is $O(\\frac{|\\log m|^{d}}{m})$, which may too large in high-dimensional situations (i.e., assumption 4 with a large coefficient for $O(m_t^{-\\zeta})$). In fact, in the experimental part,  Figure 2(c), when d=5, the online Sinkhorn algorithm already has lower error than the new compressed online Sinkhorn algorithm.\n\n2. The Algorithm 2 proposed by the author improves the speed compared to the original online Sinkhorn algorithm by using measure compression technique to compress $u_t$ and $v_t$ from $n$ atoms to $m$. However, there is a trade-off between accuracy and speed. According to assumption 4, the smaller the value of $m$, the faster the algorithm but the larger the error. The article seems to lack a detailed discussion on this matter, such as how to choose an appropriate batch size $m_t$ when solving actual OT problems.\n\n3. The experimental sections lack the application of the algorithm on real-world data and more complex distributions."

However, the paper lacks an explanation on how to choose specific values for parameters $a$, $b$, and $\\zeta$, which makes the experiments in this paper somewhat less persuasive.

Traditionally, one draws samples from the continuous distribution and then computes these distances between discrete distribution by constructing an $n^2$ sized cost matrix. However, the focus has shifted on finding the distances between continuous distributions directly. The challenge in doing so is that how one can compactly represent the continuous dual functions in a discrete manner. Mensch and Peyre introduced the online Sinkhorn where they primarily showed how to execute the Sinkhorn algorithm by representing the continuous duals compactly and showed how the dual functions converge to the optimal ones. \n\nThere are two main contributions of this paper. First, the authors provide an updated convergence rate for the online Sinkhorn algorithm (after correcting an existing inaccuracy in the work of Mensch and Peyre). They also conduct experiments to suggest that their bound may be tight for certain distributions.\n\nSecond, the sample size grows polynomially as the algorithm progresses. To make it more space efficient, they provide a compression mechanism to represent the distributions leading to certain gains in experiments."
