Different from previous works that adopt a uniform exploration policy for all users, this paper proposes a user-oriented exploration policy to learn different exploration strategies for different types of users. Specifically, this paper applies the risk-averse distributional reinforcement learning to maximize $CVaR_{\\alpha}$. Moreover, the authors divide users into different groups based on the quantile score of expected returns and utilize population-based reinforcement learning to learn separate agents to optimize $CVaR_{\\alpha}$ with different quantile scores $\\alpha$. Experiments are conducted on the recommender simulator based on three real-world datasets."

According to Eq. (1), there is a nested relation between these five user groups. For example, the user group with $\\alpha = 0.4$ contains the users in the user group with $\\alpha = 0.2$. This definition is problematic and will result in a redundancy in policy optimization for different user groups.\n2.\tThe motivation of this paper is to design a separate user-oriented exploration policy for different user groups. However, to my understanding, there is no explicit exploration strategy design for different user groups, and only the optimization objective $CVaR_{\\alpha}$ varies for different user groups, which does not necessarily promote user exploration for different groups.\n3.\tThe used evaluation metrics (total reward and Depth) do not validate the effectiveness of exploration. Other exploration-related evaluation metrics such as diversity and coverage are necessary to demonstrate the exploration performance."

Although the user argues \"user behaviors with different activity levels require varying intensity of exploration, while previous studies often overlook this aspect and apply a uniform exploration strategy to all users\", this is not true.\n\nExploration for different user activity levels (especially designing exploration strategies for new/cold-start/low-engagement users) are very common projects for industrial recommenders with a lot of existing strategies. In the domain of active learning, there are also a lot of previous works that proposed similar ideas to conduct user-side active learning based on criteria like activity level, popularity, prediction uncertainty etc. These existing works make the core technical contribution of this paper become more incremental.\n\n2. In this paper, \"the framework essentially learns multiple actors where each actor predicts for a specific user group with a predefined level of activity\", this essentially leads to an increase of effective model size(multiple-actors instead of single actor). How much of the gain comes from a larger model size and how much is coming from a more effective exploration strategy?\n\n\n3. In the introduction session, the quantile of CTR was used to illustrate the user's activity level. Is this reasonable? For example, in an extreme case, a new user with 1 impression and 1 click will lead to a 100% CTR but the system still knows little about him and needs more intensive exploration. Shouldn't metrics like total number of clicks etc be more suitable in this case?"
