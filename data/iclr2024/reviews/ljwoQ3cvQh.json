                "value": "It is well-established that neural networks are miscalibrated and overconfident on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. At the same time, it is also known that classifiers tend to be less confident on OOD compared to In-Distribution data [1]. \nIn this paper, the authors investigate the reasons why neural networks are less confident on OOD data, and propose the \u201creversion to the OCS\u201d hypothesis as a possible explanation of this behavior. The Optimal Constant Solution (OCS) is a constant output to which neural networks converge when diverging from ID data. In the case of a classifier, the OCS corresponds to the uniform distribution over the target classes.\n\n**Contributions**\nIn relation to the OCS hypothesis, the paper's contributions are the following:\n- Empirical validation that the learned feature representations on OOD data have smaller norms (Fig. 4). This leads to the fact that the output of OOD is mostly driven by the input-independent components of the model (biases). Accordingly, the OCS is then mostly identified by the biases of the network (Fig. 4). Lastly, the role of the feature norms and network biases on OOD data was investigated theoretically in the restricted setting of Deep ReLU networks (Section 4.2).\n- Empirical validation that as data deviates further from ID data, the output converges to the OCS (Fig. 3).\n- In Section 5, the OCS hypothesis was leveraged as a tool for risk-sensitive decision-making. More in detail, we can define a classifier with a rejection option such that the OCS corresponds to preferring rejection to guessing one class. In this way, following the \u201creversion to the OCS\u201d hypothesis, the further the classifier with rejection is from ID data, the more is prone to prefer the rejection option.\n\n**Limitations**\nThe authors also addressed the limitations of the OCS hypothesis in the appendix, by showing that the hypothesis does not hold for adversarial examples (Fig. 8) and for specific types of noise (Fig. 9).\n\n**References**\n1.

This paper shows a result, that, in my opinion, might have been overlooked by the existing literature: while some OOD inputs might have high confidence, the more an input is far from ID data, the more the output *should* converge to some constant value.\n- Existing OOD detectors, among the many, have exploited the norm of the learned features [1,2] and the confidence of the output [3] to detect OODs. This paper connects the two methodologies through the OCS hypothesis, by showing that OOD are less confident and detectable thanks to the lower feature norms and the reliance to the bias terms.\n\n**References**\n1.

Although I understand that the results on the OCS hypothesis are still preliminary, I would like some additional remarks on when it might fail (as you showed in the appendix, but also as shown in works such as [1]). I suggest to briefly address this aspect in the introduction (see also Questions).\n- I don't understand the conclusions drawn from the decision-making scenario. Ideas contained in the Hendrycks baselines paper ([1] in the summary) implicitly assume the OCS: if we choose an abstain threshold on the output confidence of a standard classifier, we already expect a non-zero abstain ratio on OOD data.  In general, anomaly detectors on neural networks based on the output confidence are based on these ideas. Could you explain better the intuitions provided by section 5 on exploiting the OCS? How does the OCS hypothesis possibly change the way in which we define safer AI models with rejection options, compared to simple threshold-based ones?\n\n**Typos**:\n- Page 1: \"Therefore, the our hypothesis...\"\n\n**Concluding remarks**\nOverall, I liked the paper thanks to its clarity and valid contributions, but I have some doubts on section 5 and the connections to related works.

In other works, do you expect that high-confidence OODs have to be constructed (e.g. adversarial examples), while the other ones will mostly respect the OCS hypothesis?\n- In the OCS hypothesis, you clearly stated the assumption that OODs are high-dimensional. Is the OCS not valid on low-dimensional toy examples? \n- In Figure 6, the OfficeHome dataset is the only one that has lower abstain ratio for the oracle compared to the predicted rewards. Is this because of the high number of target classes, compared to the other dataset, that makes it easier to achieve low confidence outputs?"

It formulates a hypothesis that neural networks tend to move towards a constant value as the distribution shift on the input data increases. The first empirical observation exhibits that the norm of the feature representations decreases when the data are OOD and not sampled from ID. Then, the paper argues that this translates into the input-independent parts of the network (e.g. bias vectors) to dominate the output representation, thus explaining the more uniform prediction. The paper further argues that this constant value is close to the optimal constant solution (OCS). Then the paper focuses on why the OOD predictions have this tendency to move towards the OCS; the paper associates this behavior with the low-rank assumption on the learnt subspaces. The paper conducts a series of experiments with standard neural networks (e.g. resnet) to verify this hypothesis empirically. An application in high-risk decision making is also presented to exhibit the usefulness of this observation."

The paper first demonstrates the strong (negative) correlation between the distance to OCS and the OOD score (estimated by separately trained low-capacity models) over 8 image & text datasets using ResNet, VGG and DistilBERT (Fig 3), then shows the reason is that OOD inputs tend to have smaller projected feature norms $||Wh||$ (Fig 4), which could be theoretically explained within homogeneous DNNs with ReLU activations (Thm 4.1). Finally the paper presents an OCS-based selective classification algorithm using MSE loss, and validates its performance (abstain ratio, reward) against the standard (CE) classification and an oracle (with access to evaluation data) on 4 CV datasets (Fig 6 & 7)."
