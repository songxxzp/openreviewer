This is achieved with a link between time-conditioned diffeomorphisms and Lagrangian solution maps for the continuity equation. Two application settings were considered, where in one setting the user has sparse data on both density and velocity, and in another setting, the user has no data but knows the equations. Low-dimensional experiments are done to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed parameterization."

What is the advantage/disadvantage compared to e.g. RealNVP [2]?\n* The experiments section is weak in my opinion, and weaker than that in [Richter-Powell 2022]. If I understand correctly, all experiments are in 2D. How would the parameterization fare in higher dimensions? Higher dimensional experiments are done in [Richter-Powell 2022]. In [1] it is found that TIPF does not work well in dimension >= 10. I suspect the same behavior occurs here, due to the reason that invertible pushforward networks might not be expressive (or might be hard to train).\n\n[1] Li, Lingxiao, Samuel Hurault, and Justin Solomon. \"Self-consistent velocity matching of probability flows.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.13737 (2023).\n\n[2] Dinh, Laurent, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, and Samy Bengio. \"Density estimation using real nvp.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.08803 (2016)."

At the bottom of the first page, it reads \"in setting (ii) we measure only the density of the fluid but we know additional equations defining the velocity.\" If density is already known for all time, then isn't it already enough to reconstruct the velocity without needing to know any additional equations, by simply solving the continuity equation?\n2. In the evaluation in Section 5.2, the gold standard of $W_2^2$ is computed using discrete estimates (and then averaged). However, the discrete estimate of W2 is known to be biased. How can one be sure that the red bars on the right of Figure 3 are accurate? Would the bar shift if more samples were used?\n3. In (15), how is the double integral computed in practice? It looks like it requires uniform samples from the domain $\\Omega$, which could be very ineffective if the flow only concentrates on a small portion of the domain."
