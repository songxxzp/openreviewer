Clarification on that from the authors could substantially change my assessment.\n\u00a0\nThe paper presents only an incremental improvement on SOTA methods, and in many ways the main Theorem (3.2) is really no more than a simple Corollary from prior work with a simple affine transformation on the variables (which would usually be done anyway in dealing with non-image data with very different means and scales in each data dimension).\n\nThe main issues, written in questions to the authors, concern (a) the presentation of the comparison with isotropic SOTA, and (b) the validity of the input-dependent noise (the method introduced in section 4.3). This latter is also used as the basis for the main results in section 5.3. Hence my rating for the paper could be improved significantly in light of any author response/clarification to my questions.\n\nSome more minor comments here though:\n- The binary case rather than multi-class is used for Cohen. This gives poorer results, of course. Not an issue, as it is done consistently for the proposed and SOTA methods. But it should be at least clarified as the statement of Theorem 3.2 suggests that the p_B value will be used, but then in Table 1 it is not (ie it is replaced by p_B = 1 \u2013 p_A)\n- The definition of Acc in the Metrics section has it defined as a function of V\u2019_S. And yet V\u2019_S does not appear on the RHS!! (instead you have replaced it with the dth root of the product of the sigmas times R)\n- At small radii, the SOTA methods are better (on the graphs) than the proposed method. Some discussion would be welcome on this.\n- In section 5.1, it is mentioned that Cohen gives a tight radius. Again, as per above, this is really only in the non-binary form."

That said, the results in section 5.3 apparently include a certified accuracy wrt radius. It is not clear if this may be an answer to my query as it is not clear exactly what is being reported here.\n\nRe section 4.3, I am a bit confused. This input-dependent proposal would give an x-dependent sigma, and hence an x-dependent classifier (ie x-dependent noise, over and above the obvious dependence on x). Theorem 3.2 holds assuming the noise is constant in the ball around x. This proposal in 4.3 violates that surely. Hence it is no longer true that Theorem 3.2 guarantees that the classifier gives an unchanged output in the region claimed, and so the proposed classifier is not certified robust in the claimed reghion around x. I may have misunderstood. Clarification/explanation is welcome.\nPlease see aeXiv paper 2110.05365 for an example of work done with input-dependent noise."

Please at least briefly mention them and why they are stringent.\n2. Definition 3.1 does not really appear to be a \"definition\" in mathematical terms. It looks more like you are re-stating the certified radius theorems for general distributions and norms. So, this should probably be labeled as a \"theorem\".\n3. Please move the definition/review of alternative Lebesgue measure to Section 3.1, where Table 1 appears with Alt. Lebesgue Measure as a column.\n4. In Section 4.2, the loss function is solely a function of the NPG parameters $\\theta_g$, correct? If so, it would be good to explicitly write $\\mathcal{L}(\\theta_g)$ to emphasize to the reader what you are optimizing over. Furthermore, $\\sigma$ and $\\mu$ would be functions of this parameter $\\theta_g$, right? If so, it would also be good to write $\\sigma(\\theta_g)$ and $\\mu(\\theta_g)$ in the smoothing loss expression.\n5. MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM: Your highest performing approach, using input-dependent anisotropic smoothing parameters that are optimized per-input, breaks the robustness certificates. Namely, randomized smoothing robustness certificates intimately rely on the same model being used to predict at the nominal point $x$ and all perturbed versions $x+\\delta$ in the certified ball around $x$. However, if you optimize $\\mu,\\sigma$ at $x$, then the smoothing-based certificate only says that $x+\\delta$ will yield the same prediction if you also use the same parameters $\\mu,\\sigma$ to define the prediction at $x+\\delta$. But, according to your scheme, you actually re-optimize $\\mu,\\sigma$ at the perturbed test input $x+\\delta$ to generate the prediction at $x+\\delta$, meaning you are using a different model than what smoothing certifies at $x$. This mathematical breakdown of certified robustness for input-dependent smoothing has been noted before in past works, and is the reason why works like Eiras et al. (2022) augment their input-dependent scheme with \"memory.\" In order for your input-dependent smoothing scheme to work, you would also need to appeal to some \"fix\" like this memory method, which comes with its own issues (e.g., relating to dependency on input order, and increased memory overhead costs). Either you should fix this issue (and hopefully your certificates still provide substantial improvement over state-of-the-art), or you should remove this input-dependent part of the paper (which, in my opinion, would significantly reduce the contributions of the paper)."

                "value": "My issues with this paper stem from two different directions, which I find to be significant hurdles to my ability to recommend this paper for publication.\n\nThe first is the fact that the contribution in constructing the anistropic noise measures (the core conceit of the paper) is essentially just a basic modification to extant techniques, with no other modifications being made. However, this is not in and of itself a reason for rejection - simple modifications can lead to impactful contributions. \n\nMy primary concern relates to the alignment of the chosen area of investigation to the broader problem space. Specifically, I do not think that there is any framework (either in the literature or suggested in the framework) that would case about the area of the region of certification. From the certifiers perspective, what information about the security of a model is gained by knowledge of the Lebesgue measure of the noise region (or any other measure of the area of certification)? The primary measure of risk is the nearest extant adversarial example - this is well established in the literature as a measure of the adversarial risk (see Gilmer's \"Motivating the Rules of the Game for Adversarial Example Research\", 2018), because this measures the effort required for an adversary to identify an adversarial example. Any other risk measure would need to be well justified and well posed, and this is not the case within this work. \n\nGiven that the certified distances to the nearest possible adversarial example are unchanged by your work, I do not see how this leads to an improved understanding of adversarial risk. I would argue that rather than significantly improving upon SOTA, you're introducing a new metric to mask the fact that you do not appear to produce any level of outperformance. \n\nFor a few minor issues:\n-The use of lambda as the scale parameter, and $\\sigma_i$ as the modification of the scale parameter. But $\\lambda$ is typically proportional to the standard deviation, so using $\\sigma_i$ as part of the notation is not as clear as it could be. \n- A secondary minor issue is that Table 1, I believe the Lee et. al PDF should be proportional to $||z||_{\\infty}$, rather than $||z / \\lambda||$.\n- The idea of including a headline figure of an 182.6% improvement over SOTA - anyone reading this who was not familiar with this field would assume that this would be an apples-to-apples comparison, but it's not. There's no SOTA for certification that cares about area driven measures of certification, and so claiming a comparison to these prior techniques is not reasonable or well justified."

If I am not misunderstanding, the evaluation criterion is based on scaled radius, which has different weight in each dimension.\n\nI believe this is true because I am surprised to the evaluation results provided in Table 3 that the $l_2$ certification on CIFAR-10 reach over 70% even under radius 1.75. By simple calculation, for commonly-used $L_{\\infty}$ norm with budget 8/255, it achieves at most $\\sqrt{3072 \\times (\\frac{8}{255})^2} \\approx 1.74$, that means in your UCAN it achieves at least 70% robust accuracy for 8/255 $l_{\\infty}$ attacks. This result is unbelievable, because existing SOTA performance of CIFAR-10 robustness may only achieve about 60% if no further data augmentations are conducted (like diffusion model), let alone UCAN is only a certified method based on $l_2$ norm. Therefore, although the paper said they evaluate certified accuracy w.r.t radius, I am doubtful of this claim and I think the authors only consider scaled radius robustness.\n\nHowever, scaled radius certification seems not a fair criterion for certified robustness. It is reasonable that in some dimensions, the image is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, e.g., contour of an image. Reversely, in some dimension images are intrinsically robust to perturbations like background of the image. Therefore, I believe the corresponding variance $\\sigma$ is small when UCAN performs on these vulnerable dimensions, and gain robustness back in some ``unimportant\u2019\u2019 dimensions.\n\nOverall, the evaluation setting of this paper seems differently from existing RS methods. It is a consensus that using $l_p$ norm as constraint for images, the authors should provide corresponding evaluation on standard $l_p$ norm, or at least, provide the explanations or practical scenario on why using scaled radius as the evaluation criterion.\n\n2.\tIn Theorem 3.2, your certification using the p-norm of $\\frac{\\delta_i}{\\sigma_i},$ but it seems that $\\frac{\\delta_i}{\\sigma_i}$, is a one-dimension scalar as $\\delta_i$ is the i-th dimension of perturbation $\\delta$. Furthermore, this theorem is seemingly a direct corollary from Theorem 3.1, because your certification divides the variance $\\simga_i$ for each $\\delta_i$ (not anisotropic anymore?).\n\n3.\tThere might be missing of some baselines for $l_1$ [a] and $l_{\\infty}$ [b, c] certified robustness. It will be better to compare the UCAN with existing certified $l_1$ and $l_{\\infty}$ methods.\n\n[a] Levine et al. Improved, deterministic smoothing for L_1 certified robustness.

I believe the two losses are optimized alternately but not simultaneously.\n3.\tThe authors said that randomized smoothing achieved great success for certified adversarial robustness. Could RS really make classifier robust? Can you provide comparison of RS based model to the SOTA methods for achieving robustness?"
