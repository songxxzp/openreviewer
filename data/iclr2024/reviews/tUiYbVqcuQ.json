The algorithmic idea is very simple and straightforward and fails to discuss many important practical considerations. For example, if the agents do not share their actor models, the benefits that federated learning can expedite training by aggregating the agents\u2019 policies no longer exist. This paper also does not discuss synchronous vs. asynchronous parameter sharing and its related issues, which in my opinion are also important topics when designing federated learning algorithms. \n\nThe simulation results are rather small scale: The authors only conducted simulations on one simple traffic signal control and compared with two baselines. In general, I would expect to see more comprehensive evaluations on diverse MARL benchmarks and comparisons with popular state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. From the numerical results, the improvement over existing methods is also marginal. In addition, the related work section is also far from comprehensive, and no proper reference is given in the majority part of the paper."

The motivation behind the method is to address the potential privacy issues with previous federated learning-based MARL methods where an agent must share their model information with other agents during training. At the same time, A2FC is also designed to enable federated learning in cases where agents in the multiagent system have different action spaces. A2FC achieves this by designing each agent to have its separate policy and critic network that are individually trained, while the critic network of different agents is also periodically aggregated to combine the knowledge and experience of different agents. \n\nA2FC is finally tested in an environment that simulates a traffic signal control problem. A2FC's performance across different metrics is specifically compared against multiagent A2C and independent A2C. The authors argue that their experiments indicate their method produces superior performance against compared methods across the different evaluated metrics."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**(Major Weakness - Soundness - Mistaken claims about MARL methods)**\n\nThis research is motivated by incorrect claims regarding MARL algorithms (and especially MAA2C). In both Section 1 and Section 3.1, the authors **claimed that MARL methods require agents to either (i) share their policy parameters or (ii) communicate to deal with partial observability**. However, while they require agents to share observation and action information, Centralized Training Decentralized Execution MARL methods can operate during execution time without having to share policy parameters or communicate. At the same time, it is incorrect that existing MARL methods require agents to be homogenous by having the same action space. A MARL benchmarking work from Papoudakis et al. (2021) did an extensive study on the effects of training different policy networks for agents not sharing a common action space. \n\n**(Major Weakness - Soundness - Lack of Demonstrations Regarding The Need for Federated Learning)**\n\nAnother issue is the simplicity of the ATSC environment which does not adequately show the need for federated learning. In environments based on simple simulations like ATSC, all agents' policies, the centralized critic, and the simulation should fit in a single machine. In that case, we can leverage CTDE methods that operate on observations and train all the methods in the same machine without having to concern ourselves with privacy issues. During execution, the decentralized methods should then operate without having the need for any communication or information sharing, enabling the trained policies to work in different machines.\n\nI believe to better show the need for federated learning, the authors have to use environments where centralized training is not possible either because of (i) models or (ii) simulations with large sizes that cannot fit within a single machine. In these environments, training requires real communication between machines and federated learning should be crucial. However, the simple ATSC environment used in this work seems too simple to show this need for federated learning.\n\n**(Major Weakness - Soundness - Missing Baseline)**\n\nThere are potential baselines that can also (i) minimize exchanged information between an actor & centralized server and (ii) deal with heterogeneous agents. For instance, MAA2C (Papoudakis et al., 2021) where agents have separate policy networks and a shared centralized critic saved in the centralized server could also achieve this goal. Without having to exchange the parameters of the actor and centralized critic network, an agent can still learn if it sends:\n\n1. Its achieved rewards,\n2. Its selected action,\n3. Its observation,\n\nto the centralized critic in the centralized server. In turn, the centralized critic can update itself and return an advantage function that each agent can use to update their respective policy networks.\n\nArguably, the above MAA2C method would be preferable since agents will not have to send neural network parameters, which (i) usually use more communication bandwidth compared to the agent's individual rewards, actions, or observations. At the same time, sending these rewards, actions, and observations could better preserve privacy by disclosing less information about each agent's decision-making process.\n\nSince this modification of MAA2C is suitable for the problems addressed in this work, it should have been included as a baseline.\n\n**(Minor Weakness - Soundness - Problem Formulation)**\n\nThe choice of using MDPs to model the interaction between agents in the MARL problem is also questionable. In the case of MARL where teammates continuously change their policy as a result of learning, an MDP's Markov assumption will not hold and MDPs will not be adequate models of agent interaction. A better choice would be to use Decentralized POMDPs  (Oliehoek et al., 2012) or Stochastic Games as the problem formulation.\n\n**(Major Weakness - Soundness - Missing Citations on Existing Deep MARL Methods)**\n\nThe paper is also missing lots of citations to existing Deep MARL methods. I would highly recommend the authors at least read the methods compared in the benchmarking paper from Papoudakis et al. (2021). The authors should then see that a lot of CTDE methods (aside from MAA2C) can actually address the problem tackled by their work.\n\n**(Major Weakness - Soundness - Environment Selection)**\n\nThe current version of the work only has experiments on the A2FC environment. Compared with existing MARL methods that use at least three different environments for evaluation, I believe limiting the experiments to the A2FC algorithm will weaken the potential significance of the results, even if it is inherently positive. Further experiments need to be done in other environments to better illustrate the generality of the method.\n\n**(Major Weakness - Soundness - Significance Testing)**\n\nThere is also a severe lack of significance testing in the analysis section. The authors only provided average returns resulting from their method without demonstrating whether those differences are significant or not. I would refer the authors to the work of Agarwal et al. (2021) for example statistical tests when comparing different RL methods' performances.\n\n**(Major Weakness - Clarity - Inadequate Description of Motivation Behind Research)**\n\nRather than explaining the differences between RL methods as in the first few paragraphs of the introduction, Section 1 could have been used to better motivate the importance of solving problems encountered in this work. For instance, this can be done by showing a diagram that outlines the exchanged information between agents and the central server. Furthermore, the authors could better argue why this information exchange is undesirable. There could also be some descriptions of why previous methods are not desirable or exhibit problems that the work wants to solve.\n\n**(Major Weakness - Clarity - Description of MARL Problem being solved)**\n\nThe description of the type of MARL problems solved is quite confusing. Early in Section 1, it does seem that the paper addresses fully cooperative environments. Meanwhile, in the rest of the document, there are instances (for example in the problem formulation) where it seems agents can have differing reward functions. I would expect some consistency in detailing this important information.\n\nCitations:\nPapoudakis, Georgios, et al. \"Benchmarking Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in Cooperative Tasks\".
