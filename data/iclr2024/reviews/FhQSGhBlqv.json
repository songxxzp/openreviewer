                "value": "1. I am not convinced about the claim on page 1 that, for algorithms like FCI, \"the research relies on the assumption that all hidden variables are independent of each other\". Could you perhaps point to where that assumption is made? As far as I know and have checked, any maximal ancestral graph (MAG) is learnable from conditional independence using FCI, and a MAG is also valid if obtained from marginalizing over dependent latent variables.\n2. By \"latent ones\" do you mean latent variables? If so, I would say latent variables instead, because it is not immediately clear what \"ones\" refers to.\n3. In Theorem 7, what is the distinction between $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{X}_\\mathcal{G}$?\n4. Why is it so important to have a unified causal discovery framework, in the sense that rank constraints are used for finding the CI skeleton in Phase 1 of the procedure? I imagine it is more important to find an accurate CI skeleton, so do rank constraints provide more accurate *d*-separation statements than conditional independence tests? Could it also be better to mix different types of tests?\n5. I imagine FCI would perform quite poorly in terms of the skeleton F1 score for all variables (Table 2), since it does not explicitly identify any latent variables, but how do you explain a score of 0.00? Does that mean that FCI did not get any edge right at all, not even between observed variables, as Table 3 also suggests?\n6. What happens after Phase 3 in Algorithm 1? How is the information from $\\mathcal{G''}$ transferred to the Markov equivalence class? How are the rest of the orientations performed? I am also confused by the fact that $\\mathcal{G'}$ is supposed to be the skeleton on the observed variables (output of Algorithm 2 from PC), yet toward the end it becomes the MEC over both observed and latent variables (output of Algorithm 1). What am I missing here?\n7. The idea of learning part of the latent structure explicitly has important ramifications. Could the authors perhaps comment on what extra information can be ascertained relative to methods like FCI, for which the latent structure is implicit? Put a different way, does the difference lie solely in the fact that some latent variables can be identified? Will RLCD always provide more structural information than FCI or other CI-based causal discovery algorithms?"
