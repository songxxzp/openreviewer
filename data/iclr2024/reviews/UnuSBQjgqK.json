Hence the agent needs to balance the Intrinsic and extrinsic objectives with a $\\tau$.  \n\nThe author introduces Constrained Intrinsic Motivation (CIM) for RFPT and EIM.

It is related to experiment design kind of objectives or more widely maximizing submodular functions under MDP constraints. These functions capture that visiting the same state will result in reduced rewards and hence naturally encourage exploration to gain higher rewards. The submodular functions can thus encode state coverage, entropy maximization, and Mutual information (D-design) kind of objectives. There are works on submodular reinforcement learning that might be interesting and related to the authors.\nThe work is also related to convex RL but I see two papers cited (Hazan & Mutti) in that direction so I believe the authors are aware of it."

I have to go back and forth to make sure I do not miss important information. I think the authors should replace them with in-text citation if possible. In general, I understand that good empirical results themselves can make a good paper. However, the use of notations and formulas should help to clarify the high-level idea and reduce the ambiguity. However, I found it hard to follow the notations and they are not self-contained in this paper and some formulas can be extremely confusing. I am listing a number of examples here.\n\n1. We should not call Theorem 2 a theorem as it is a text-book level property in information theory, which should not considered as a contribution of the paper\n\n2. (5), despite being the main contribution of the paper, is be very confusing. The constraint seems to be on the function $\\phi$. However, the intrinsic objective does not depend on $\\phi$. Should the constraint be on the learned skill $z$ such that there exists a representation of state that leads to good alignment. In such case, the constraint should be $\\exists \\phi, L_a(\\phi(s), z) \\leq c$, where $c$ is some constant. I think the definition of the CIM really has to be made clear as it is the main contribution of the paper.\n\n3. Right above (10), the paper mentioned that the bound is tight when \\phi(s) and z is well aligned. I don\u2019t think this is correct. The function $g$ is already not invertible, so $H(g(s) \\mid z)$ bound is never tight.\n\n4. What is $k$ in the sentence \u201cthe intrinsic reward of CIM for RFPT is then \u2026.\u201d? \n\n5. In (11), I don\u2019t see how this constraint optimization problem solve the issue of suboptimality. This basically ensures that the value of the online-policy is non-decreasing if we consider the approximation of $\\hat R_{k}$ you mentioned in the following paragraph. This does not guarantee that the policy can always be optimized to the true optimal policy.\n\n\nI personally think that the proposed methods (if I understand it correctly) is a very novel approach and the simulation studies are interesting and complete. However, I don't think this paper is ready to publish unless the writing is significantly improved."
