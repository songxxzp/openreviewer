                "value": "The paper presents a task-oriented environmental adaptation approach for intelligent agents, particularly those using large language models, to autonomously model new environments in dynamic scenarios like online shopping. The approach is divided into two phases: Pre-Task Environment Exploration, which uses a greedy exploration strategy to form an initial environmental model, and In-Task Environment Update, which refines this model based on task execution and interaction data, leading to improved task performance.\n\nI have several major comments and questions:\n\n- In the abstract it\u2019s not clear what is the role of language agents, and \u2018language\u2019 in particular in the proposed solution/innovation. All described is the process of recursive greedy exploration and update, a process that is not novel and has been around for some years now.\n\n- Similar issue with the introduction. I still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s the role of language or language agents in the recursive refinement process. The introduction needs to be significantly revised to focus on the central innovation and contribution proposed by this paper, which I believe is around the use of language and language agents, rather than the recursive environment model update, which is not novel.\n\n- It is not very clear to me, from the introduction, what is the critical problem that this approach is trying to solve. The paper needs to be motivated much better. Try providing intuitive examples that why adaptive environment modeling is a significant problem that needs to be addressed. You may also consider adding a mathematically rigorous problem formulation section.\n\n- The first point mentioned in the list of contributions in not a contribution. It more sounds like a motivating question. Please remove. It\u2019s better to only have two contributions than overselling a motivating point as a significant contribution to the field.\n\n- Please apply the revisions suggested in my first two comments to the second contribution item as well. Again, I believe the contribution is around the use of language and language agents for environment modeling, rather than the recursive environment model update. The latter is not novel.\n\n- I read through the methodology, and unfortunately, still don\u2019t have a solid understanding about the role of \u2018language\u2019 in the proposed solution. Is language used for the refinement process, for instance by posing critical questions regarding the greedy actions made and their outcome? This is unclear and need to be explained in more details.\n\n- If I understand correctly, during the refinement process, the history of the greedy actions is considered and then the environment model is updated. Is that correct? But what is the update process, specifically, as described in equations 2-3. Also, is there a mechanism to refine the greedy action policy? Is the greedy action policy adopted for the entire model refinement process? How to be sure that the greedy action execution policy is the best approach throughout the model refinement process?\n\n- The evaluations and results are significantly insufficient. More test cases, benchmarks and metrics are needed for a solid conclusion. In the only result figure presented, why are the accuracies so low? Why aren\u2019t any of the ablations learning anything? Such questions need a detailed discussion. Also, error bars must be plotted to see if the differences are statistically significant. This also applies to results and numbers reported in the tables. Overall, the evaluation section is very weak and needs significant improvements.\n\n- What are the limitations of the approach. The limitations are never discussed.\n\nAt current states I vote for rejection mostly due to weak motivation, unclear presentation, unclear contributions, and weak evaluation. I need to see more discussions and revisions as suggested above, as well as suggested by my fellow reviewers to make this a ICLR-ready paper. I\u2019d be happy to increase my score when authors satisfactorily addressed the comments."
