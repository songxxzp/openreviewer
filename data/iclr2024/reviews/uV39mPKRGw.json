When there is a large number of concepts, it becomes evident that the algorithm's maintained models may encounter difficulties in effectively handling this situation. This limitation is a result of the algorithm's design.\n\n3.The overall design of the model lacks novelty, as there are many similar methods available. The author simply transfers existing methods from other domains to the problem of federated continual learning without introducing any substantial innovation.\n\n4.The experiments should be more comprehensive and diversified.

In terms of experiments, the experiments are also insufficient. It is very important to discuss the number of concept models and clustered groups, as well as their relationship from the perspective of theory or experiment, which can help readers understand the importance of clustering for FCL. The authors are suggested to provide more analysis and reasons about all experiments, such as performance differences based on various distance functions, clustering methods, etc. \n4. The authors claim that two issues in Federated Continual Learning (FCL), catastrophic forgetting and interference among clients, can be greatly diminished. It will be better to prove that claim through conducting some experiments. \n5.
