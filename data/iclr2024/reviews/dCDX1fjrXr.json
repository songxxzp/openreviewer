The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning scenario under sparse labels, but the experimental part is not clear about the setting of this scenario.\n4.

Will this bring a large amount of calculation and memory usage? Please analyze the complexity of the algorithm.\n5. The paper gives a set of experimental hyper-parameters in 5.5.1, such as learning rate, hidden layer size, etc. Does this mean that the settings are the same for each data set?\n6.

The motivation for the method described in the paper is unclear from the descriptions of the paper.\n\nIn the experiment, this paper compared the proposed approach to LP, SGC, DGI, GMI in which GMI is the most recent approach published in 2020. However, the compared approaches are not state-of-the-art. Since graph neural network is one of the popular research topics in machine learning, the proposed approach should be compared to more recent approaches. Could you compare the proposed approach to more recent approaches to show its effectiveness? The proposed approach should be compared to the approaches listed in Section 2. \n\nAs described in Section 4.4, beta_1, beta_2, and beta_3 are set to 1/3 due to the simplicity. However, it is unclear why this parameter setting is recommended in the paper. The proposed approach can handle other parameter settings. Why is this parameter setting recommended in the paper?\n\nThe paper should reveal the theoretical property of the proposed approach. As described in Section 4.3, it needs a high computation cost to compute Equation (4) directly. Therefore, the proposed approach approximately computes it using an iterative solution, as shown in Equation (5). I am interested in the theoretical difference between direct and approximate computations. Similarly, the proposed approach approximately computes the adjacency A_GH, as shown in Section 4.4. Please discuss the theoretical properties of the approximate computations.\n\nIn addition, I am interested in the theoretical computational cost and empirical processing time of the proposed approach.

Therefore, the novelty of this work is very limited. Moreover, I think that the performance of the proposed method will be heavily affected by the performance of the label estimation step. There is no principled guarantees for the proposed method to work well in general, especially when there are more labels than what the authors considered in the experiments. More on this in the next point. \n\n- I am not really convinced by the empirical section that the sparse labels setting is important. (The sparse labels setting may be a relevant and important problem for many practical settings, but the empirical section fails to demonstrate that. ) The datasets used in the experiments are standard benchmarks for node classification on graphs. In the standard train/test splits, these datasets already have a very low label rate, ranging from ~1.5% on Computers to ~5% on Cora and CiteSeer. Existing methods already perform very well at this label rate. The authors considered scenarios where there are only 3 to 60 labels in these datasets. This looks like a made-up setting to me. I would recommend the authors find alternative datasets where it is genuinely hard to obtain many ground-truth node labels, and thus we can only have access to a few dozen labels.\n\n- The clarity and writing can be significantly improved. When I read the paper, I often have to read a couple of places twice or three times in order to understand what the authors trying to explain. Let me just give an example. In Section 4.2, the authors wrote \"..., nodes in $l_H$ were chosen ...\". This is confusing due to previously $l_H$ was defined to be a number, but in this sentence $l_H$ seems to be a set of nodes. I would recommend the authors spend serious effort to polish the writing of this paper."
