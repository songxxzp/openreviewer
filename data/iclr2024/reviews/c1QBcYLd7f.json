To provide a valuable contribution to the field, it is crucial to address the limitations and shortcomings of existing approaches, such as kernel-based, deep neural network-based, and graph-based models. Additionally, the authors should clearly articulate the advantages of this new method compared to GNN-based models [1,2,3,4].\n\n- [1] Learning neural point processes with latent graphs\uff0cWWW2021\n- [2] Graph neural point process for temporal interaction prediction\uff0cTKDE2022\n- [3] Spatio-temporal point processes with deep non-stationary kernels\uff0cICLR2022\n- [4] Gaussian process with graph convolutional kernel for relational learning\uff0cKDD2021\n\n2.\tGraph construction, including the definition of nodes and edges, is pivotal in GNN-based methods. The paper needs to provide a detailed explanation of how edges between nodes are established. Are the edge construction methods applicable universally across different scenarios, or do they require case-specific adaptations? While the process is well-defined for synthetic datasets, it is less clear in real-world data scenarios. The assertion that edges represent potential interactions should be elaborated upon to ensure clarity.\n3.\tThe authors use THP-S and SHAP-G as baselines. However, these baselines employ powerful transformers and graph attention mechanisms. It would be expected that they offer significant flexibility. This work should provide a robust justification for why the proposed model outperforms these baselines. Is there a theoretical basis for the superior performance?\n4.\tNotably, the synthetic data is primarily generated using kernel methods. Hence, I think the proposed model should fit this data well. However, the observed improvement in likelihood compared to the baseline is very minimal and possibly not statistically significant. The authors should offer a convincing explanation for this limited improvement. \n5.\tThis concern follows question 4. The discrepancy between the log-likelihood, which is similar to the baseline, and the substantially improved time prediction MAE is perplexing. I am suspicious about the accuracy of the MAE calculation. I recommend the authors clarify how this probabilistic prediction model is employed for predictions \u2013 whether it is based on random sampling or mean predictions.\n6.\tIn the evaluation using real-world data, Table 3 indicates that the advantage of the graph-based approach diminishes as the number of nodes increases. This observation runs counter to my expectation that graph modeling should excel in complex graph structures. The authors should provide a detailed analysis and potential explanations for this outcome.\n7.\tLack of crucial baseline comparisons. A robust baseline comparison is essential for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. The absence of such comparisons is a notable limitation in the paper. For instance, even without incorporating a graph, models like THP [5], and DAPP[6] possess the inherent capability to capture inter-event interactions. Additionally, there are intensity-free methods [7] available in the literature. Hence, it is necessary to compare the proposed model against state-of-the-art point process models [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].\n- [5] Zuo, Simiao, et al. \"Transformer hawkes process.\" International conference on machine learning.
