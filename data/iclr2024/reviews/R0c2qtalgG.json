The authors construct the ToolE dataset for this task; the queries are generated using various prompting methods (\u201cemotional generation,\u201d \u201ckeyword generation,\u201d \u201cdirect diverse generation,\u201d \u201cdetailed generation).\n\nThe second task is \u201ctool selection.\u201d Four subtasks are proposed to evaluate tool selection: (1) Tool selection with similar choices: select the correct tool from a list containing similar tools. (2) Tool selection in specific scenarios (specialized scenarios). (3) Tool selection with possible reliability issues: given query and tool t, construct tool list such that the t is not in the tool list; assess if LLMs can avoid choosing tools that do not exist in the list. (4) Multi-tool selection. \n\nThe tasks seem to be done in a zero-shot manner based on the prompts in the appendix. For the first task, most models achieve ~random accuracy (except for ChatGPT and Vicuna which are better than the others \u2013 also potentially because these models are largest in the batch). Performance on the second task is unsatisfactory too."

Positive examples are the ones that require tools, and negative examples are the ones that can be directly solved by LLMs. For negative examples, the authors use three instruction tuning datasets like Commonsense QA and instruction datasets in LIMA. I\u2019m a bit confused because a lot of those questions are quite difficult, and intuitively would definitely benefit from retrieval, for example. The reason LLMs can solve them may be because they appeared in the pretraining/fine-tuning datasets already, so LLMs remember the examples. So why are those instruction tuning datasets in the negative subset (if it wouldn\u2019t harm if they search for info on the internet)? \n\nSome answers (on whether LLMs need tools for a Q) in Table 12 and Table 13 are debatable in my opinion. I wonder how the authors define a reference answer (on whether LLMs need to use a tool) if with or without the tool, LLM can both solve the question. Similar issue for the second task (tool selection). What would be the human performance on these tasks? \n\nRelevant to the above two: would it be more prudent to measure \u201cwhether LLMs know when to use tools / whether they can use tools\u201d by actually performing tool use experiments \u2013 the metric would be the accuracy on the downstream task (e.g., whether the weather actually matches internet search, or whether some calculation actually equals the correct answer, or whether a 2-hour reminder is created in some simulator)?\n\nThe experiments are done zero-shot. I wonder if few-shot prompting (with chain of thought reasoning) can improve the performance (on both tasks) by a lot. \n \nI wonder what the tool descriptions are. I don\u2019t see detailed tool descriptions in the paper. I also don\u2019t see any supplementary materials in the submission. In the tool description, is there info on *when* a *language model* should use the tool? If not, then I naturally don\u2019t expect LLMs to do well on the tasks in this paper."

Thus, it might be incorrect to describe API-Bank as only focusing on tasks \u2462\u2463; (2) ToolBench (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16504) also involves the task \u2461, requiring the retriever to retrieve the most relevant tools. Thus, it is also incorrect to describe the ToolBench as a benchmark that only focuses on tasks \u2462\u2463; (3) There are also some benchmarks that are missing in the table, like ToolQA (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13304.pdf). In summary, the authors better clarify the differences compared with these existing benchmarks more clearly.\n- Most statements in the experiments are not well explained. I think the authors should focus more on the potential reasons and analysis behind these observations.\n- I am a little bit confused about the second conclusion you have obtained in Section 3.3.

Unlike recent related benchmarks, they study the reliability of nine LLMs at tool selection between similar choices, across challenging and diverse scenarios, and when multiple tools are needed. To generate diverse scenario prompts, the authors use algorithms that apply prompting and tool merging & decomposition. Through multiple studies and error analyses, the authors characterize ways in which most LLMs are inconsistent and poorly calibrated at tool usage.\n\nThe authors emphasize tool usage as a concrete way to test hallucination (does the LM know when it needs help from a tool? does the LM know which tool to use?) and sycophancy (does the LM know when to defer to tools despite context in the prompt?). The work also makes interesting connections between recommendation (or retrieval) and tool usage from an evaluation standpoint."

To construct the queries for evaluation, they prompt OpenAI models in a set of four pipelines. They also generate multi-tool queries from pairs of tools.

What did the authors do for tuning? Did they use the prompt unchanged for each LLM? (Having no dev set is completely reasonable in principle, but practical considerations tell us that much of the community will, in effect, reuse the test set so often it becomes a dev set. I recommend having at least a few examples explicitly for tuning.)\n\n2. Which Llama2 models were used, vanilla or chat? I presume it's chat. It may be good to include more explicit information in the main text. You find that \"the worst-performing model, Llama2-13b, has an F1 Score of only 11.53%\". This is surprisingly low. Is this some kind of unintended interaction between the chat format or some other minor detail and the task?\n\n3. Is the word \"task\" is overloaded in Sec 2.3, where it refers both to the two major tasks \"2.3.1\" and \"2.3.2\", and to the four sub-tasks of \"2\"? Maybe rename the four tool selection tests to \"sub-tasks\"."

One of the things mentioned is that other works lack diverse user inputs whereas this work does have diverse user inputs. Experiments or evidence for this is missing in this paper?\n\n2.  Keyword Generation and Details Generation: What\u2019s the exact difference between the two?\n\n3.  Multi-tool selection: We select top-15 popular tools \u2014 for each pair generate 5 queries\n            1. How do you select the popular tools? Manual? \n            2.

Multi-tool queries seems to have been created with no semantics associated to the queries or there are no specific details on it.

Are there any human validations on the percentage of tool combinations that are useful in the dataset?\n            4. The results are also pointing in this direction where it seems to be very evident for ChatGPT, Llama2 and Vicena-13B that the queries are multi tool queries \u2014 Seems unnatural queries where the patterns are evident? \n\n 4. Awareness dataset: positive examples from ToolE dataset and negative examples from other datasets\n            1. Tt\u2019s unclear how this dataset can be useful. The negative examples will be starkly different from that of the positive examples. Furthermore, it\u2019s unclear if the negative examples truly does not require any tools. There might be setting specifically in commonsense QA where tool use can be useful such as entity extraction and relation extraction from the text that can inform answers. The aspect of tools is probably too domain specific to make such assumptions\n\n5. Tool selection with possible reliability issue: There are concerns how this experiment is setup or the motivation behind this experiment. If the tool is not available and a similar tool is available (Overlapping tool) and if the LLM is able to detect that then shouldn\u2019t the LLM be given those points. This experiments seems non-realistic and would need more investigation on the reliability of LLMs (hallucinations)\n\n6. No Related work: How does this work compare to ToolLLM, toolAlpaca, API-Bank, etc etc. Can those datasets be transformed to Meta-Tool in which case how would that work and what are the drawbacks. The motivation of this work is not very concrete because of the existence of these datasets and no comparison to those. \n\n7. While at a meta-level these tasks make sense, the aspect of arguments for each of the tools and execution is not focused in this work. A good explanation for this would be useful and makes it easier for the reader to understand. Specifically because when discussing tools, the arguments and executions plays a very important role."
