The author proposed homophily that can be applied to non-uniform hypergraphs and provided an analysis by demonstrating the homophily distribution changes with levels in Cora-CA and 20Newsgroups datasets. However, there is a lack of explanation regarding how the changes in homophily with levels are related to the performance of HGNN models or the characteristics of those datasets.\n2. The novelty of the MultiSet framework proposed in the paper is limited. This is because previous research, such as EDHNN2 [1] and HNN [2], has already explored the use of different representations for each hyperedge.\n3. The MultiSetMixer shows only marginal improvements in performance compared to existing baseline models and, in some cases, even exhibits lower performance. However, the paper lacks an analysis of the reasons behind these performance variations. It would be beneficial to have a comparison between the performance of MultiSet and AllSet along with explanations.\n4. The main focus and key contributions of the paper are not entirely clear. While the motivation section highlights the shortcomings of existing hypergraph research and emphasizes the need for new homophily measures, architecture, and benchmark datasets, the actual experiments seem to place more emphasis on the mini-batching method than on the newly proposed homophily or the MultiSet architecture.\n\n\n[1] Equivariant Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Operators, ICLR 23\n\n[2] A Hypergraph Neural Network Framework for Learning Hyperedge-Dependent Node Embeddings, arxiv 22"

TKDE.) It is recommended to include these works in your paper and discuss the differences.\n\nW2. homophily is not a gold standard criterion in the graph learning area. Some network data are not isomorphic. The limitations and applicable situations should be discussed.\n\n\nW3. In traditional dyadic graph neural networks, there are two branches. The 1st one is GCN-based methods, which take node features as input and aggregate information by topological structure. The 2nd one is Transformer-based methods, which take node features+position encoding as input and use self-attention to update node embeddings. The differences between hypergraphs and dyadic graphs are their topological structures (e.g. dyadic graphs contain pair-wise relations and hypergraphs have higher-order hyperedges). This difference makes sense when we design a hypergraph neural network by the 1st branch. I wonder what the significant contribution of hypergraphs will be if we design a hypergraph neural network by the 2nd branch.\n\nW4. the experimental performance seems not that surprising. From my own experience, the message-passing pattern: \"node to hyperedge and then hyperedge to node\", is usually not better than directly aggregating nodes without hyperedge representations. For example, $X=\\Theta X W$ where $\\Theta$ is the hypergraph Laplacian matrix  Your MULTISET extension seems also to confirm my guess: you use multiset aggregating and it is very similar to aggregating nodes from a more fine-grained view (you split hyperedge representation more carefully compared with traditional simple hyperedge aggregating). Then I wondered what would happen if we completely removed the hyperedge representation in the network updating. It seems the residual connections play a crucial role in your \"node to hyperedge and then hyperedge to node\" message-passing flow, I wonder what would happen if you completely remove this component and compare your hypergraph structure with directly aggregating nodes without hyperedge representation.\n\n\nW5. I admit that the new extension is helpful for message-passing-based methods. However, as more generalized data, hypergraphs should be more general than dyadic graphs. The hypergraph model should be more general than traditional dyadic graphs and it may be promising to achieve more general AI on graph domains. From this view, transformer-based methods are usually larger than message-passing-based methods. I wonder how to design a large hypergraph model with heavy parameters (like GPT in NLP) to achieve the \"ChatGPT moment\" in the graph area. It seems that the 2nd branch is more promising than the 1st branch because the 2nd branch can easily generate many large models while the 1st branch suffers from shallow layers. I suggest reconsidering the contribution of this work from a bigger picture: I wonder what the meaning of their extension, or how helpful their extension can contribute to achieving this AGI vision.\n\n\nW6. The experimental work should be more extensive. For example, \"Can the concept of homophily play a crucial role in HGNNs, similar to its significance in graph-based research? \" Following this question proposed by the authors, the experimental section should clearly present the applicable situation and whether the homophily indeed contributes to the final performance and how much.\n\n\"Given that current HGNNs are predominantly extensions of GNN architectures adapted to the hypergraph domain, are these extended methodologies suitable, or should we explore new strategies tailored specifically for handling hypergraph-based data? \" I didn't see the answer to your question. \"Are the existing hypergraph benchmarking datasets truly meaningful and representative enough to draw robust and valid conclusions?\" I didn't see your response to this question.\n\nW7.  Following W4. I think the challenges, target problems, and the motivation of your new extended multiset structure, are not well formulated, and not clearly discussed."
