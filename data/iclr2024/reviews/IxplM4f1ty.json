            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper has several weaknesses:\n\n1- The most important weakness is that the notion of using contrastive loss for semi-supervised leaning is not new. The approach has been used in a variety of semi-supervised literature. Examples include \"Class-aware contrastive semi-supervised learning\" (already cited in the paper), \"CoMatch: Semi-supervised Learning with Contrastive Graph Regularization\" (not cited), \"Contrastive Regularization for Semi-Supervised Learning\" (not cited), and others. In fact, the ablation study shows that almost all the contribution is coming from one of the losses (Ls) and the other isn't doing much. Examples of the general idea being used before is \"Supervision Accelerates Pre-training in Contrastive Semi-Supervised Learning of Visual Representations\".\n\n2- One of the emphases of the paper seems to be the \"end-to-end\" aspect of the work. First, this is not unique to this paper, many other semi-supervised methods take a similar approach. Second, why is being end-to-end so important? The claim is that it is more efficient, but there are no studies to back this up. Moreover, while this may impact training, it doesn't seem to impact inference (which is what we really care about).\n\n3- There are key papers that the paper does not compare its results to. Examples include MixMatch, FixMatch, AdaMatch, and others, which have been proposed in other areas (not necessarily for time-series). And then specifically for time-series, there are methods that are missing, e.g., \"PARSE: Pairwise Alignment of Representations in Semi-Supervised EEG Learning for Emotion Recognition\". All these missing comparisons make it hard to understand how good the method is comparison to others."

                "value": "I have major concerns regarding the methodology, summarized as follows.\n\n- The novelty of this work is quite limited. The paper just adds unsupervised and supervised contrastive losses along with classification loss in an end-to-end way. Nothing is different about the methodology, the loss function, or the augmentations.\n- Table 3 shows that the unsupervised contrastive loss is ineffective. Its removal has barely affected the performance. This means that supervised losses (as expected) are the most important ones, which deteriorates the significance of the end-to-end training that mainly targeted including the unsupervised contrastive loss.\n- The authors have completely ignored semi-supervised time series representation learning methods in the literature review and did not use any of them as baselines. Despite having the \u201c++\u201d variants of self-supervised methods, this is just an added cross-entropy loss, and might not be the best way to get a good performance. Other methods proposed for semi-supervised time series can have better approaches to handling the data in a way that improves the performance, and therefore, should be included. Examples are:\n[1] \"Self-supervised learning for semi-supervised time series classification.\"*PAKDD*, 2020.\n[2] \"Self-supervised contrastive representation learning for semi-supervised time-series classification.\"\u00a0*IEEE TPAMI* 2023.\n[3]\"Deep Semi-supervised Learning for Time-Series Classification.\"\u00a0*Deep Learning Applications*, 2022.\n[4] \"Selfmatch: Robust semisupervised time-series classification with self-distillation\", International Journal of Intelligent Systems 2022.\n[5] \"Semi-supervised time series classification by temporal relation prediction\", ICASSP 2021.\n- The hybrid loss is a weighted sum of the three losses. How did you calculate (or assign) these weights?\n- The performance gap in Table 1 is significantly high and not well-justified, especially with the smaller fractions of data. Also, I find this an issue with some of the results. Specifically, I noticed that SLOTS is basically the same as SimCLR++, but with a supervised contrastive loss (Ls). However, The accuracy of SimCLR++ in Table 1 is 0.5862, while SLOTS (w/o Ls) in Table 3 is 0.6103.\n- In the experiments, the settings of the \u201ctwo-stage SLOTS\u201d are not clear. Do you use the supervised contrastive loss in fine-tuning or not?\n- In the ablation study, I expected to see the performance without both contrastive losses, i.e., only cross-entropy loss, to see how the addition of contrastive learning was useful.\n- Since you attempt to achieve a fair comparison in your experiments, I noticed that most of the baselines are using 1D convolutions, while you use a 2D convolution. This can a minor issue, but it can affect the comparison.\n- What does \u201cFull model\u201d mean in Table 3 in SLOTS (two-stage)?"
