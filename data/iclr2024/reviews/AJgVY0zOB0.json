It assumes that the pose label during training is not accurate. The proposed method first estimates the orientation with a self-supervision. Then the translation is estimated using feature similarity matching which is supervised by a soft-margin triplet loss. The proposed method is evaluated on KITTI and VIGOR datasets with quantitative comparisons. It outperforms most of the SOTA methods, except a recent work in ICCV 2023."

Given that the accurate pose label is not available for some places, it is still possible to get small-scale accurate labels at known locations. In this case, a semi-supervised setting could be more suitable than a weakly supervised formulation. The small-scale accurate label could also help improve the performance if properly designed.\n-\tSome suggestions to think about (Not a weakness): It might also be interesting to consider larger errors for the training images, for example, the satellite-view image has a certain probability of being an incorrect match of the query but is still close to the ground-truth locations. \n-\tThere is still room for improvement in the writing.

The idea setting this technique apart from others is the abandonment of rigorous exploitation of ground truth camera poses. The paper is well structured and reads easily. Estimating rotation and translation of ground cameras on large scale is a significant problem in many applications. The paper, altough not explicitely mentioned, target representation learning as it addresses the gap in feature representation between overhead satellite images and perspective\n images taken by the ground camera."

Registration of top view and ground images is especially difficult as image features for matching are rare, e.g. because of occlusion, out of plane rotation, etc. The idea in this work is to circumvent this matching problem by considering CNN features on much higher level with much larger receptive fields and semantic information.\nAnother idea of the technique is the possible avoidance of ground truth camera poses needed for training the model. The inference of rotation is thereby trained by a self-supervised learning approach, while translation is interpreted as correlation problem between satellite images and ground images. The training is supervised by a few labeled ground truth poses similar to metric learning problems.\nThe results in table 1 are promising, altough a gap between the solutions w vs. w/o knowledge of ground truth poses still exists. The comparison with other SOTA methods clearly show superiority of the technique (table 2)."

By focusing in you introduction and motivation on these problems and novelties, the paper would make clear its contributions to representation learning, the main topic of this conference.\n\nAt some places in the paper I found incorrect statements:\n- page 2: \"neural networks are inherently sensitive to rotations ...\" in its generality this statement needs to be refused as e.g. equivariant networks address this problem (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.07362.pdf)\n- page 2: \"... synthesised overhead view image ...\" the sentence gives the reader the impression that satellite images are always \"overhead view\" orthographic images which of course is not the case\n- page 4: \"magnitude of the rotation\" ?\n- page 4: \"the equivariance property of convolution to translations ...\" convolution is invariant to translation\n- page 5: Eq 2 descibes the correlation coefficient but later on page 14 a convolution was used"

In practice satellite images are orders of magnitude larger. To be useful in practice, the method needs to find regions of interest in satellite images in order to perform registration.

To facilitate the training, the authors synthesize bird's-eye view images with known rotation and translation as self-supervision from the satellite images.

It is very difficult to learn feature representations that are invariant to these changes. \n   - In order to convince the audience that the gap is small, the authors should a) introduce their data augmentation in detail, b) analyze the feature differences between the projected and actual bird's-eye view images.\n- An important reference is missing: \"OrienterNet: Visual Localization in 2D Public Maps with Neural Matching\", CVPR '23. \n  - The proposed method in this paper is very similar to this missing reference except for the self-supervision. The OrienterNet has achieved better performance than the paper, and more importantly, it is better written with deeper insights. \n  - To highlight the difference, the authors should clearly describe why precise supervision is difficult, which does not seem to be the case for me since we can get precise reconstructions even from a mobile phone and then register a sequence of images to the satellite images."
