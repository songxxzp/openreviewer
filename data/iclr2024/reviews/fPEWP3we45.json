The problem setting comes with several challenges, including how to deal with unseen objects/backgrounds, subtle behavior differences between success and failure as well as detecting failure during policy execution. \n\nThe authors propose to learn pattern flow in the policy\u2019s representation space and design novel architectures, such as a pattern extractor to extract discriminative patterns of different rollouts. It also applies several novel training tricks: rollout augmentation and temporal-aware triplet loss to stabilize training.\n\nBesides the contribution of a new method, this paper also designs new challenging FSI tasks to evaluate AED methods and baselines."

When deploying a human-robot interactive system, we should be able to separate out human error and robot error.\n\n- In the visualizations, the failure is detected after the fact (5 frames later), which is undesirable if the damage is already happened. This is expected as the design doesn\u2019t include a world model to predict possible failures.
