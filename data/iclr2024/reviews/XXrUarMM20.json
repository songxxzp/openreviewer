The proposed method achieves 3.68\u00d7, 4.89\u00d7, and 4.54\u00d7 theoretical multiplication complexity reduction for 3\u00d73, 5\u00d75, and 7\u00d77 convolutions, respectively.\n- Moreover, the corresponding post-training quantization method requires only a few samples for calibrating network parameters and restoring accuracy without the high cost of retraining. The extensive experiments demonstrate an accuracy drop of less than 0.2% under Int8 quantization for models trained on ImageNet."

One of the primary concerns is the speedup achieved through current approach. The paper only provides theoretical multiplication complexity reduction, which may not necessarily translate to real-world speedup. Given the complexity of the algorithm and the potential overhead, it is important to provide empirical measurements of computation efficiency. \n\n3). PTQ method is a well-established technique.\n\n4). The evaluation is only performed on ResNet models, which, while important, are somewhat outdated. It would be benificail to evaluate the methods across a more extensive range of CNN models, particularly the compact ones like EfficientNet and MobileNet.\n\n5). Today, numerous techniques exist for accelerating CNN models, including the design of compact architecture, sparsity, distillation, and quantization. For quantization alone, it is possible to reduce precision to sub-4 bit level while preserving model accuracy. The paper only compares its approach to other fast convolution algorithms, such as Winograde, and while it demonstrates improvement, it is challenging to evaluate the significance of this approach compared to toher alternatives."
