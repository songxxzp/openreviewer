The proposed method considers hidden confounders on graphs and uses an identifiable graph VAE model to simultaneously estimate these confounders and learn the generation functions of the causal model. By enforcing consistency in the predictions of classifiers for different counterfactual graphs, the authors achieve graph counterfactual fairness in these classifiers. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on various graph tasks. The author also provides a theoretical justification in the Appendix."

According to them (I haven't checked), they are the first to consider a full causal model on graphs: protected attributes and hidden latent variables are independent but cause the edges in the graph and node features. The more general framework allows for considering graphs that are generated as a result of latent variables and protected attributes e.g. social networks where people are friends based on their demographic background and personality.\n\nBoth the generation function and distribution of latent variables are unknown. They learn both simultaneously using the ELBO method. I hadn't seen this before and enjoyed looking it up, thanks!\n\nThey use a mixture of Gaussians to model the hidden cofounders. This seems like a fine assumption to me but I'm skeptical that it leads to the \"identifiability\" property they want; basically, they want only one set of parameters to give the right distribution of the observables so, if they fit the observables well, they know they have the right latent distribution. They show a theoretical result that a weakly injective function gives this property for their construction (I didn't look at the proof).\n\nThey also compare their method to several others on synthetic and real data. Generally, their method achieves better counterfactual fairness but sometimes sacrifices accuracy. It's hard to compare the results because they're generally incomparable (how do you compare higher accuracy but lower counterfactual fairness?).\n\nEdit 11/22/23: Increasing review to 4 to be more in line with other reviewers average of 5. I don't see any responses from authors so no change to my substantive evaluation.\n\nEdit: I don't see 4 as an option so it's a 5 from me."

Your main theorem seems intuitively obvious: if a function is (approximately) injective then of course only one set of parameters will give each output.\n\n\u2022 I'm confused why generating the latent variable as a mixture of Gaussians would help with identifiability. In your experiments, I assume you generate the true latent variables with a mixture of Gaussians? Then of course a model that also generates latent variables according to a mixture of Gaussians will get a better fit than a model that doesn't. If I understand what's going on here correctly, your presentation seems borderline misleading. I also want a theoretical reason for why a mixture of Gaussians helps with identifiability. Your theoretical result only says that the function being (approximately) injective suffices; you could probably have chosen any other distribution for the latent variables and this would still be true.\n\n\u2022 I find it concerning that you don't apply the contrastive learning component of the NIFTY and GEAR approaches. If you don't apply the entire method, then it seems unfair to say yours performs better.\n\n\u2022 My understanding is that the real world data you use does not have a graph structure.
