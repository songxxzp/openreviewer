For instance, it is difficult to find the formal definition of DistillSpec among the analysis of various existing distillation approaches; it is not clear how distillation data is generated in detail; the specific configurations of target and draft models in figure 6 are not given, especially for the size of the target model in the DistillSpec case. The clarity and structure of the paper should be improved.\n- While DistillSpec is effective on certain tasks, the experiments mainly focus on T5 models and simple tasks (except for GSM8K), compared with the recent advances in LLMs. This also results in the lack of discussion on the difficulty of LLM distillation. Is DistillSpec also effective for LLMs like LLaMA-7B? Can distilling LLMs for some specific tasks also be helpful for other tasks in general? The effectiveness of DistillSpec should be evaluated using more recent large models and some zero-shot benchmarks to prove its effectiveness.\n- The paper does not compare or discuss DistillSpec with other methods that combine large and small models at inference, especially under the lossy decoding cases [1].\n- The paper does not analyze the generated texts by DistillSpec in greater detail, like the diversity and coherence, which are important aspects of text quality and largely influenced by the sampling approaches. It would be helpful to provide some examples of the generated tasks.\n\n[1] Kim, S., Mangalam, K., Moon, S., Malik, J., Mahoney, M.W., Gholami, A., & Keutzer, K. (2023).

The results on larger models are not very clear -- in Figure 6, which data points correspond to which sizes of target and draft models?\n4.
