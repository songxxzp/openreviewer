                "value": "The paper addresses the problem of using approximate models in reinforcement learning (RL). RL training is broken into several stages:\n1) Model learning: learns a graph neural network model (GNN) for world dynamics, then clusters actions taken in that world model into groups predicted to lead to high rewards\n2) RL learning: trains an RL model (DDPG) to learn to perform the task. Search includes an exploration condition that samples from the above action clusters as part of epsilon-greedy search.\n\nTo facilitate long horizon planning, the task is divided into a series of sub-goals that are solved sequentially. The GNN used as a world model incorporates several adjustments to apply to the particular task domain (allowing for dynamic edges, edges specific to object pairs, and encoding positions in relative coordinates). Evaluations compare against a random baseline model, showing improved probability to achieve goals in a physics-based puzzle domain."

                "value": "# originality\nThe novel components of the work are minor: training GNNs to model dynamics is well-studied (as referenced) and model-based RL is a well-studied field. The technique can be viewed as a form of exploration prior to favor exploitation of high value actions. Previous work on exploration techniques may be relevant, as these span a variety of ways to leverage approximate models for altering action selection (https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2020-06-07-exploration-drl/ provides a survey). While those techniques are typically applied to modify rewards during learning, the core approximate models are closely related to the paper technique.\n\n# quality\nIn absolute terms the success rate is low for goal success (ranging from ~0.2% to ~16%). Whether this is an improvement is not clear as the experiments only compare to a baseline of random action. No comparisons are made to SOTA on the task domain, nor are other models applied to this problem. Adding baseline methods from prior work would improve the paper quality by showing evidence of improvement. Comparisons would also benefit from including metrics on the computational costs needed for different methods and their time and memory complexity, providing a full picture of the performance of the algorithm beyond the final goal outcome.\n\n# clarity\nThe paper would benefit from an algorithm listing and figure demonstrating the overall training process workflow. These are left implicit in the text and make it difficult to follow the core algorithm.\n\n# significance\nResults lack non-random baselines for comparison. This makes it difficult to assess how much the new technique improves over the state of the art."

However, many approaches to model-based exploration use a learned model solely for exploration (see [1, 2]). E.g., curiosity-driven approaches use a learned model to derive intrinsic rewards based on the model\u2019s prediction error, information gain, etc. The paper would benefit from discussions and empirical comparisons to other model-based approaches to exploration. \nFor instance, it is unclear if model inaccuracies would impact curiosity-based exploration more than the approach presented here.\n\nAlso see Q2.\n\n\n**W2.** The paper makes some strong assumptions that limit the generality and applicability of the proposed approach. \n\nOne strong assumption that the paper makes is to have a resettable \u2018true\u2019 environment, which allows multiple environment rollouts from the same environment state (point 3 on page 5). Another crucial assumption is the availability of subgoals in sparse reward environments.\n\nOn a minor note, Figure 6 could be improved as it is currently hard to analyse.
