                "value": "This paper proposes an architecture framework for collaborative learning with the aim of incentivizing collaboration among multiple entities while maximizing the utility of the coordinator. The framework is realized by formulating a pricing plan, which determines participants\u2019 participation cost, and a selection plan, which selects active participants to determine the collaboration outcome. The conditions of Nash equilibriums and also the optimization objectives for the system are derived in the paper. The authors have also empirically shown the versatility of the framework by applying it to three concrete learning scenarios of interests, including federated learning, assisted learning and multi-armed bandits."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. This work proposes a grand framework with abstract terminologies that unifies existing formulations for the incentivization problem into a unified framework. However, what are the new insights that can be derived because of this unification and cannot be observed otherwise? I can see that the work still mainly relies on deriving Nash equilibriums with individual rationalities (IR) constraints, and strives to maximize some system utility (maybe more flexible with hyperparameters). These concepts are commonly seen in the existing literature that the authors have cited. And mutual benefits of the coordinator (or, system) and the participants (or, clients) are not rare in existing works, either. Therefore, I wonder what are the new insights? This point is important to assess the significance of this paper.\n2. Could you elaborate on the specific meaning and implications of \u201cprior works has often focused on designing an incentive as a separate problem based on an existing collaboration scheme, instead of treating incentive as part of the learning itself\u201d? This is stated at the end of the \u201cRelated Works\u201d section.\n3. The pricing plan $\\mathcal{P}$ looks at the realized collaboration gain from the outcomes of the active participants in $I_A$ to charge all participants in $I_P$. Does the pricing differentiate participants with high $z_m$ from those with low $z_m$?\n4. It appears strange to me that the pricing for the non-active participants depends on the individual gains of the active participants $z_m$, stated in (1). Please correct me if I am mistaken.\n5. Under the formulation of this paper, the incentive of participation for $m$ only depends on the utility income of $m$ himself minus the participation cost. This means that the client is incentivized as long as (9) is fulfilled. However, in practice, a candidate\u2019s incentive should also depend on other candidates. For example, knowing that others have a higher expected gain with lower-quality data can deter participation. How does the framework address this scenario?\n6. Clarification: At the end of Page 5, it is stated that \u201cif not selected, it will become an inactive participant with zero gain, which will contribute to the system\u2019s profit but not harm the collaboration.\u201d Why would the gain be zero? All participants will receive $z_{I_A}$ and there might be a large utility income gain for this \u201cinaccurate candidate\u201d. \n7. How does Theorem 1 translate to functional forms of the pricing plan in practice?\n8. Why is it acceptable and reasonable to assume the utility functions (e.g., utility income $\\mathcal{U}$) of the candidates are known to the system for pricing and selection? Also, how practical is it to calculate $E [ \\mathcal{U}(z_{I_A}) - \\mathcal{U}(z_m) ]$?\n9. It was mentioned in Remark 5 that \u201cif following the above-optimized selection plan, will not select it as active\u201d. However, I could not find descriptions in the main text about the selection plans that make a decision based on the prices $\\mathcal{P}_m$ or local gain $z_m$. I only see descriptions about randomized selection. Could you point me to the relevant sections or elaborate here?\n\n[Minor]\n1. Better not to overload the collaborative gain function $\\mathcal{G}$ to take an individual $z_m$ as input, since $z_m$ should also depend on the outcomes of other active participants in $I_A$?\n2. Some other notations are confusing. For example, $I_P = Incent_m (\\mathcal{P})$, here $I_P$ is a set while $Incent_m()$ outputs whether a client $m$ is incentivized to participate."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- A major concern I have over the work is that in stage 1 of the method, the coordinator needs to set a pricing plan based on prior knowledge of candidates potential gains from previous rounds. This means that first the client needs to participate first to know its incentives, and moreover, if the potential gain is erroneous, the ICL framework may not be able to properly incentivize the clients. This becomes even more trickier when clients have the flexibility to opt-in or opt-out which can often be the case for incentivized collaborative learning settings.\n\n- Another concern I have is that the work did not compare their method against other relevant work for incentivization in collaborative learning such as \n [1] Yae Jee Cho, Divyansh Jhunjhunwala, Tian Li, Virginia Smith, and Gauri Joshi. To federate or not to federate: Incentivizing client participation in federated learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.14840, 2022. \n[2] Avrim Blum, Nika Haghtalab, Richard Lanas Phillips, and Han Shao.

In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 8927\u20138936. PMLR, 2020.\nEspecially for parts of the work such as 3.1.1 which aims for large participation approximation works like [1] seem relevant and other parts such as section 3.2, [2,3] seems relevant. It seems strange to me that the work does not compare their work with such relevant line of work.\n\n- Lastly, the work seems mainly theoretical since the experimental validation is rather limited. However, the assumptions they use for the theoretical work such as having a three entity setting is rather restrictive. Moreover the implications of the main theoretical results such as Theorem 2 and 4 is unclear to me. In what conditions it is guaranteed that the clients benefit from the system for each corresponding theorems? \n\nDue to these main reasons I am leaning towards rejection. I look forward to the author's rebuttal phase and discussion."
