Kernels are especially well suited to include by design wishable properties such as equivariance with respect to symmetry operations in the group of 3D rotations SO(3). In particular, symmetry-adapted kernels under the form of body-ordered kernels have been proposed in the literature. However computing these kernels with high order \\nu > 2 is impractical. This paper proposes a single to compute iteratively high-\\nu kernels by relying on lower-order kernels. This computation is backed up by a proof given in Appendix. A numerical section is devoted to test the so-called Wigner kernels in the context of  Kernel Ridge Regression on datasets where a high body-order is needed (random methane dataset, QM9 and RM17 datasets)."

Moreover even if it does not insist on that point, it also gives a nice example of geometrical learning where the hypothesis space induced by a kernel inherits by definition of geometrical properties.\n\nOriginality: While this work follows in the footsteps of many recent works about kernels for molecules based on 3D point-cloud presentations and symmetry-adapted kernels, it proposes a new way of computing them and as so, is original.\nClarity: the paper awfully lacks of clarity for a machine learning reader (see weaknesses).
