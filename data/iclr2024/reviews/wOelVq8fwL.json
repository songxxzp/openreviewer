                "value": "Concern about experimental setup:\n* The ablation in Fig 5 doesn't seem to disentangle the contributions of exploration and \"communication\". In particular, performing exploration and receiving non-linguistic feedback (e.g., in the environment) doesn't seem to be evaluated. And on the other hand, training with static instruction-tuning data augmented with \"communication\" traces sampled using the same method as LTC (without sampling agent actions, but using the static demonstrations instead) is not evaluated.\n\nWriting feedback: I found the paper was relatively confusing in the terminology used.\n* I would suggest renaming the approach away from \"through communication\". This phrase is very vague, and there really isn't any true communication happening here at all: the learning setting is to just prompt the model(s) to replicate what a dialogue might look like in the domain. It is much more reminiscent of work on distillation and learning from oracles, like DAgger (as briefly mentioned in a footnote on page 7).\n* Framing this as continual learning also seems wrong. Fine-tuning with LTC is performed on some held-out set of examples from these datasets' training sets, right? So how is this continual?\n* Some of the language around LLMs is too anthropomorphizing. E.g., \"human-like\" LLM agents, \"the agent's brain\".\n* Minor nitpick, but the whole learning setup is RL, not just the training phase, as the exploration part of the proposed approach is certainly part of a general RL framework.\n* There seems to be a bug in Fig 7 with the \"question\".\n\nOne recurring issue with the clarity is that some terminology used is either overly ambiguous, or overly specific. For example:\n* \"generate trajectories in a self-talk style\"\n* references to \"masks\" in the introduction\n* \"decision-making\" as ALFWorld's task -- more precisely, the task is grounded instruction following\n* References to a value and a log-prob list in Section 3.1; this is underspecified and seems somewhat irrelevant without having introduced PPO in depth\n* \"Analogue\" as the third communication pattern -- why does it have this name?\n* \"action tokens\" in 4.2\n* In the experimental section this is particularly confusing. As a general point, some existing methods are introduced and compared against without intuition on why the experiment is performed (unless the reader is very familiar with the existing approaches). E.g., what data are ReAct-Tuning and CoT-Tuning trained on? There's a self-reference to Section 4.2.\n\nDistinguishing from some existing work would be useful. In particular, work on continual learning for language tasks such as:\n* Gao et al. 2022 (\"Simulating Bandit Learning from User Feedback for Extractive Question Answering\"), and 2023 (\"Continually Improving Extractive QA via Human Feedback\")\n* Kojima et al. 2021 (\"Continual Learning for Grounded Instruction Generation by Observing Human Following Behavior\")\n* More recent work on RLAIF (e.g., Lee et al. 2023, or self-instruct, Yang et al. 2023)"

ICL is less efficient at inference time, but LTC requires a lot more compute for finetuning.\n* How are rewards derived? Is this different in each environment?\n* Did you evaluate the quality of the teacher agents? How often are they making mistakes?\n* Why not perform a 3x3 experiment combining the three datasets and the three \"communication\" patterns?\n* What are the actual steps for training? It seems the model starts as LLaMA-7B, then is instruction-tuned on a domain-general dataset, then instruction fine-tuned with data sampled from GPT-3/4, and _then_ LTC is applied? \n* What is the stopping condition for LTC training? Just when the training data has ran out?\n* Why are the results in Table 1 very low precision?"
