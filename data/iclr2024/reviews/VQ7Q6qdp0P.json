To mitigate this issue, it proposes a simple regularization loss, which encourages to preserve the original CLIP during finetuning. Specifically, it empirically shows that minimizing the l-2 distance to the original model in the feature space (LDIFS) is consistently better than minimizing the l-2 distance in the parameter space, resulting in less \"concept forgetting\".

Although the paper reported results of many experiments, I think the impact could be somewhat limited because all downstream tasks are classification with relatively small-sized training data. I am not sure if the observation in this paper (that l2-distance in features space is better metric for regularization) will generalize to other practical settings when there are medium-sized training data that covers many concepts. For example, there are observations that CLIP finetuned on existing detection dataset achieves good performance on open vocabulary detection [1], which implies that the finetuned CLIP can recognize concepts unseen in the finetuning dataset instead of forgetting them, possibly by interpolating the seen concepts. Also, when downstream task is not a classification task but is less similar to pre-training contrastive loss, such as detection, the stability-plasticity trade-off could be worse and the effect of regularization methods could be different. I think it would be interesting to do similar experiments in the paper to such other downstream tasks.\n\n2. I think \"catastrophic forgetting\" and \"concept forgetting\" address the same problem, as also mentioned in the paper. Since catastrophic forgetting have been studied in many continual learning approaches, it would be nice to discuss them in more detail in the related work chapter and also add comparison with some representative methods [2] in the experiments as strong baselines when they are applicable. Especially, the idea to distill knowledge from the original model to the finetune model as a regularization looks similar, which has been studied for continual learning.\n\n[1] Simple Open-Vocabulary Object Detection with Vision Transformers, ECCV 2022  \n[2] A continual learning survey: Defying forgetting in classification tasks, TPAMI 2020"
