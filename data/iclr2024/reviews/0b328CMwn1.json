From both empirical and theoretical aspects, the authors showed the connection between activation prompts and normalization tuning and also ablated the effect of the layer and architecture. Experiments on 29 datasets showed improved performance of activation prompts over the conventional visual prompts and getting closer performance to fine-tuning methods."

Although the related work section includes a citation for normalization tuning, there should be a more comprehensive introduction to this concept and its relevance to activation prompting in the introduction. It would be beneficial for the authors to clarify why normalization tuning was selected as a primary baseline for comparison in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n2. There appears to be a notable performance disparity between the proposed activation prompting method and full fine-tuning. In academia, such a gap may be acceptable if innovative algorithms can bridge it. However, many practical applications in vision prioritize performance over computational efficiency. Could the authors discuss any advantages of prompting-based approaches beyond computational savings? For instance, are these approaches more effective in scenarios requiring few-shot transfer learning, where the data available is much less than that shown in Table 3?"

                "value": "1. Novelty given extensive studies in the VPT paper. The VPT paper studies various different ways of applying the prompt. For example, in Figure 5, they studied the option of adding tokens instead of prepending tokens and observed slightly worse results, which is almost verified in Table 4 of this paper. In Fig. 14 of VPT, they also studied adding prompts in different depths of the network. These previous work almost makes this paper a special case in the search space covered by VPT.\n2. Fair comparison with existing works such as VPT. The main results are reported all in different settings (e.g. different backbone, patch size, pretraining, etc.) that prevent direct comparison with numbers reported in the VPT paper, although this work outperforms basic baselines such as VP and norm-tune.\n3. Soundness of the parameter counts in tables. For example, in Table 2 with ViT-L and CIFAR-10, how does LINEAR-PROBE have 1M parameters instead of 10K (1024 * 10)? In addition, if other methods (e.g. norm-tune and AP) also train a linear layer on top of the features, then this should be made clear as well. The current reported counts are significantly higher than expected (also see table 5 of VPT).\n4. Limited gain of efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared with other methods in Table 4 such as LORA etc. The main advantage of AP is the lower cost but other methods are configured to be more expensive than they should be. e.g. this paper experiments with VPT-DEEP with 50 tokens, but (1) VPT also presents VPT-shallow as a more efficient option, (2) VPT by default searches over a set of prompt lengths and in their table 13, a much smaller average token length is needed, e.g. 10 or 1, (3) VPT applied to a deep ViT-L will put VPT in a disadvantage but this could be easily fixed by prompting a subset of layers. As a result, it is not clear where this paper stands in the extensive ablations of VPT."
