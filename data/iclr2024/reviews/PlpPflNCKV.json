The word \"video manipulation\" is a little ambiguous and not well defined. I would suggest the authors come up with a proper scope of the paper with something related to reenactment. \n\u00a0\nMethod:\n- In Section 3.3.2, what is a \"masked $W+$ space\"? Why does it relate to pose matching and identity preservation. \n- In Section 3.3.3, it is known that [BiSeNet](https://github.com/zllrunning/face-parsing.PyTorch) sometimes cannot produce fine-grained masks. Will upsampling these masks with bilinear kernel bring more errors? \n- The purpose of using a co-driving  (CD)\u00a0 video is confusing. What does it do? It is not explained in the paper. \n\nExperiments & results:\n- From the results, the texture sticking artifact is very obvious even with a StyleGAN3 generator. Why would this happen given that StyleGAN3 claims it is able to produce anti-aliasing results? I notice that after \"+Modified Baseline\" (see the boundary of the hair, Ablation of Building Blocks, supplementary website), the texture sticking becomes obvious. Does it relate to this step? And what is the configuration of the StyleGAN3 generator used in the paper? \n- With a comparison with previous methods, Video2Style seems to bring some background changes in many examples in the supplementary material. Is there a way to mitigate this artifact? \n\n\nWriting & presentation:\n- The presentation of the paper needs to be improved from my perspective, given the complexity of the proposed method. For example, it is hard to understand Video2StyleGAN pipeline from Figure 2. To be specific, it would be better if the authors could include some figures/examples to demonstrate what each block is doing so that Figure 2 can becomes clearer. Moving some examples from the supplementary material to the main paper seems to be better. \n- Also in 3.3.2, the second sentence goes \"We observe that applying this change stretches the face area and the eyes, however,\nthe mouth and nose positions remain unchanged making the output face unrealistic\". From the supplementary video \"Global Pose Encoding\", it is hard to see this artifact from Restyle projection or naive method. The positions of the nose and mouth do change, which makes it hard to see if the proposed method is working or not. \n\nRelated work: Some missing related work that might be beneficial:\n- [1] Yang, Shuai, et al. \"StyleGANEX: StyleGAN-Based Manipulation Beyond Cropped Aligned Faces.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.06146 (2023).\n- [2] Xu, Yiran, Badour AlBahar, and Jia-Bin Huang. \"Temporally consistent semantic video editing.\" European Conference on Computer Vision.

While StyleGAN has proven effective for controlling various facial attributes like age and expression in images, the researchers identified limitations when applying it to video editing. The key challenge appears to be the need for precise and disentangled control over factors such as face location, pose, and local facial expressions. To address this, the researchers propose a novel approach that involves working across multiple latent spaces, including positional, W+, and S spaces, and combining optimization results. They introduce Video2StyleGAN, a method capable of reenacting the local and global features, expressions, and locations from a driving video onto a target image's identity.
