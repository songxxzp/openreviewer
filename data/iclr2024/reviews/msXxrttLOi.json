It is unclear how the implementation of these components alleviate the bias introduced by faster nodes performing more updates than slower nodes (a common issue met in previously proposed asynchronous methods). It is also unclear how the overall method  reaches an equilibrium (as discussed in section 3.1) and what properties it has. I would appreciate it if the authors could elaborate on the above. \n\n-In the description in section 3.2 it seems that when a client arrives later than $G[g].T_{max}$ it is immediately assigned a new training task whereas the clients that arrive earlier than $G[g].T_{max}$ are assigned training tasks when the next aggregation takes place. What is the justification for this differentiation? \n\n-Some of the assumptions required for the theoretical results are very restrictive. Specifically, the bounded gradient assumption rules out simple function such as the quadratic. Further, the bounded heterogeneity  and staleness assumption is rather strong and the derived results in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 have a heavy dependence on  quantity $\\mu$.

An important and well-known baseline is FedNova (Wang et al., 2020), which has been cited in the paper but not compared against. Compared with the proposed FedCompass method, FedNova is much easier to implement and supports both cross-silo FL and cross-device FL with partial client participation. The advantage of FedCompass over FedNova is not clear.  \n\n- The proposed FedCompass approach is heuristic and a lot of its description is based on simplified examples. The paper argues that FedBuffer includes the buffer size $K$ as a hyper parameter that needs to be tuned. However, FedCompass also includes hyper parameters $Q_\\mathrm{min}$, $Q_\\mathrm{max}$, and parameters in sub-procedures, such as $\\lambda$ in Algorithm 2, that need to be tuned heuristically. It is worth noting that the experiments in this paper use FedBuffer with small values of $K$ up to 5 (as listed in Appendix E) while the original FedBuffer paper (Nguyen et al., 2022) uses $K=10$ in the majority of experiments. It is not clear how the authors selected $K$ in the experiments presented in this paper, but I would expect that FedBuffer with a properly tuned $K$ would give a similar performance as FedCompass with properly tuned hyper parameters.\n\n    Side note: The algorithm is called FedBuff in the original paper (Nguyen et al., 2022), not sure why the authors call it FedBuffer in this paper.\n\n- In practice, the clients' computation speeds can vary over time due to the varying amount of concurrent tasks running in the system. The paper has a mentioning of this but only studies the behavior of the algorithm in some oversimplified cases of computation speed variation. It is unclear whether the scheduling procedure in Section 3.1 is robust to all types of speed variation, or does there exist a worst case scenario where the scheduler completely loses track in its estimation of clients' computation speeds. This needs a separate theoretical analysis IMHO, which is different from the convergence bound. \n\n- The convergence result appears fairly straightforward, since results with bounded staleness and different numbers of local updates both exist in the literature. It is not quite clear what is the challenge and novelty in the convergence analysis."
