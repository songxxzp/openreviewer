                "value": "I found the paper's fundamental question confusing. If I understand correctly, authors want to take the \"spherical\" learned embeddings of the images from the penultimate layer -- which often are not disentangled. Then the authors want to compute the class prototype by the class mean which will not be orthogonal to other classes (by design). The goal is to transform these to be orthogonal using techniques like OPL and CIDER and then make them axis-aligned and binary through ICR and DCR. Please correct me if I am wrong in this.\n\nNow the questions are\n\n1) I do not see why we need orthogonal class representations -- because semantically I would like to have a substantial weight in the tail of similar but not the same classes. In case I do not want the semantic similarity between class prototypes to be smooth, one can normalize with the appropriate temperature. \n\n2) The second question is more about why we even need these transformations. If you learn a one-vs-all multi-class classifier for all these data points and classes you will end up generating a \"one-hot\" vector of dimensionality = number of classes. \n\nThis is the regular linear classifier with softmax after all the multi-class image classification networks we learn today. The classifier itself is the projection to ensure you obtain an orthogonal axis-aligned vector for each datapoint and in turn each class. Leaving it at softmax and not thresholing gives your semantically meaningful embeddings that can further be used for class embeddings. \n\nIt would be great if these questions could be resolved and the paper heavily leans on OPL and CIDER at times and would be good to have a short background section on the math behind them.\n\nI also point the authors to error-correcting output code line of work (Dietterich & Bakiri, 1995) and probably a concise survey (Kusupati et al 2021) spanning interpretable and learned ECOCs. They aim at learning sub-linear cost class representations in binary space (not necessarily orthogonal, but can be made and also made interpretable in attribute space). This helps result in axis-aligned attribute interpretable binary codes for classes.  This also deals with some notions of OOD detection. \n\n\n\nDuring the rebuttal, if I could get an understanding of this, that would help me be convinced to accept the paper."

This affects the evaluation of the performance in the case of classification.  Since classification performance does not seem to be the main objective of the post-processing steps : other experiments could have been tried, such as robustness to label noise or robustness to adversarial attacks, as for example in the OPL method paper.\n\n- From a broader point of view, it seems that the goal of orthogonalising the latent space has something in common with  the orthogonal classifier setting, which could provide further experiments and theoretical approaches (See for examples \u00ab Controling directions orthogonal to a classifier \u00bb, ICLR\u201922).\n\n- As ICR is an extension of ISR (Aboagaye et al.),  the scope of the contribution is limited, despite the scaling capacity of the proposed algorithms."
