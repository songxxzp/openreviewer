In this submission, the author(s) study if causal discovery results obtained from IID time series data is consistent with the true causal process. To this end, the author(s) provide various theoretical results and experiments. The author(s) conclude that functional consistency is difficult to achieve in non-linear situations, and that even in linear non-Gaussian situations, the instantaneous model generated by temporal aggregation is still unidentifiable as the number the number of data points from the underlying causal process that are combined to form each observation goes to infinity."

The experiments that are there do a good job at providing an initial assessment of the soundness of their findings."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I think much of this paper is poorly explained, leading to some issues with understandability.  There are a few sentences, that occur at unfortunately important parts, that I had a hard time following.  I especially noted this in the description of the intuition behind Definition 1 and Theorem 1.\n- For the paragraph after Definition 1, that first sentence is a run-on (\"Intuitively, functional consistency might suggest X=f(X,e), here we introduce a different function f, which allows for the possibility\"), and the sentence after that sounds very strange (\"This is because actually existing such f is difficult for nonlinear case\").\n- Theorem 1 feels impossible to follow grammatically. \"f has the form ___ is necessary for the functional equation ____ holds for some f and some e that is only related to e with ______\"\nTheorem 2 could also benefit from some discussion around intuition.  My understanding is that Theorems 1 and 2 are the main results of this paper (as the conditions for consistency for functional and CI-based methods).  However, Theorem 1 suffers from the grammatical lac of clarity I described above, and Theorem 2 introduces a whole new set of variables (alpha, beta, and gamma) that don't appear to ever be defined (though please let me know if I just missed them and they are defined somewhere).  Some intuitive discussion of these theorems, as well as an editing pass to increase clarity, would improve this paper significantly.\n\nIn Section 3.1, after equation 1, you suggest that g(k) can be any normalizing function, such as g(k)=1 or g(k)=k.  However, later in that section, you say that, as k becomes large, g(k) approaches 0, allowing you to remove that term under large k.  However, I'm not sure how that works in general when you say that g(k)=1 is a valid normalizing function (which will not tend to 0).  And g(k)=k will only tend to 0 with very large k, but no discussion (that I noticed) is ever had about how large k needs to be for the results of this paper to hold.  Especially since in the experiments, the largest k I see is 50, which doesn't feel large enough to assume that g(k) -> 0.\n\nWhile the authors discuss the dangers of temporal aggregation at a high level in the intro, the only example actually provided in the intro (the effect of temperature on ice cream sales, aggregated daily) is actually one where temporal aggregation doesn't seem to pose a problem.  While the effects become instantaneous at the aggregate level, it's an effect that's consistent with the dynamics at the de-aggregated level and one that seems reasonable for causal discovery methods to detect.  With the focus on dangers of potentially spurious instantaneous relationships from aggregation, an example where such relationships can arise would be helpful for motivation.\n\nThe experiments are quite weak.  The authors present two sets of experiments: a simulation with a single, two-variable model that shows how Direct LiNGAM has issues as k increases (due to the non-Gaussianity assumpton?) and experiments with a three variable model with either a chain, fork, or collider structure, showing how CI tests perform poorly if no linearity is present.  If I'm understanding correctly, the second set of experiments doesn't actually contain any aggregation (it takes place over two time steps) and doesn't actually employ a specific causal discovery algorithm, focusing instead of the performance of CI tests.  These are reasonable first-step tests, but the lack of any remotely realistic data, data with more than 2-3 variables or across more than 2 time steps, and structures with any amount of complexity leaves the evaluation feeling very weak."

            "questions": {
                "value": "In Section 4, why are only chain-like, fork-like, and collider-like models considered?  Given that the focus is on temporal aggregation, cycle structures are quite likely (e.g., X{t-1} -> Y{t}, Y{t-1} -> Z{t}, Z{t-1} -> X{t}).  Obviously, this causes problems upon aggregation if we don't have a way for our model to learn or reason about cyclic models, but this seems like the type of case that is especially relevant in a discussion about temporal aggregation."

The denominator of the third equation is $p_{S_Y, S_X}(S_Y, S_X)$ and $S_Y$ is a function of $Y_1,\\cdots, Y_k$. Given this, it appears inappropriate to directly insert $p_{S_Y, S_X}(S_Y, S_X)$ into the integrand, as it is a function dependent on the integrated variables.\n3. Even after ignoring the doubts in the proof of Theorem 3, Corollary 1 is questionable. Given Fig.2, how can $S_X$ independent with $Y_{1:k}$ given $S_Y$? In what situation does the \"if\" statement hold?\n4. Could you state the necessary and sufficient conditions for conditional independence consistency in words, given the three equivalent statements in Theorem 3?\n5. What does the $n$ mean in Theorem 1? Should it be $k$?\n6. In definition 1, it said that \"Moreover, the function $\\hat{f}$ has some degree of consistency with the underlying causal function $f$.\" The phrase \"some degree of consistency\" is ambiguous; could it be explained more precisely?\n7.

Here are instances of vagueness taken from Section 3.1 alone.\n \n- VAR (1) is typically accepted as a linear model. It is not clear if f() covers another model. The terminology seems inconsistent to the notation.\n- The number of variables seems to be s but not clearly defined.\n- What \"k is large\" means is not clear.\n- $g(k)$ is defined as \"any normalization function like g(k)=1\". Then, how do you guarantee that $(X_1 -X_{k+1})/g(k)$ vanishes?\n- Definition 1 uses undefined terms such as \"imply,\" \"compatible,\" and \"some degree of inconsistency.\" Their definition is not very clear."
