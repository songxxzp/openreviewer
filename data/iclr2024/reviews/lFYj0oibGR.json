This work's focus on open-source models and parameter-efficient finetuning brings those models within the reach of academic compute budgets and thus is very valuable. The demonstrated results on the CALVIN benchmark are strong and support the claim that pre-trained VLM backbones are good features for imitation learning.\n\nI appreciate that the authors analyzed several of the design decisions experimentally and showed which choices have a larger influence on final performance. Particularly the results in Table 3 are interesting in that they show that larger VLM backbones are particularly beneficial in a low-data regime. I also appreciated the separate investigation of generalizability in the visual domain and to diverse language instructions.\n\nThe paper is easy to follow and most of the experiments are easily understandable."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "A main selling point of the paper is that it claims the introduced method can forego expensive co-finetuning by restricting the number of finetuned weights and freezing most of the VLM weights. However, if I understand correctly, the paper finetunes all weights that were also finetuned in the Flamingo VLM grounding stage, i.e. like Flamingo they froze the vision and language model features, but finetuned all cross-attention features that perform the vision-to-language grounding (and Fig 3b shows that this is crucial). This however suggest that the model may still forget most of the knowledge obtained in the VLM pretraining stage, ie the OpenFlamingo training. The experimental section of the paper lacks comparison to (A) co-training with the current parameter-freezing scheme, (B) full model finetuning w/ and w/o co-training to support the claim that their partial finetuning scheme is actually key to enable good performance without co-finetuning.\n\nAnother comparison that would be good to add is to a simpler, pre-trained visual representation, like VC-1, Voltron etc. These models also use internet data to train good representations for imitation learning, but are arguably easier to use than the billion-parameter scale models introduced here, so it would be good to experimentally show the benefits.\n\nOne notable difference to prior work is that instead of predicting actions as tokens in the VLM's output vocabulary, the proposed method trains a separate action head. It would be good to analyze this choice and compare to directly outputting actions as \"text tokens\".\n\nSince the paper is mainly an empirical study, it would be good to evaluate the policy on more than one environment, e.g. the IKEA Furniture assembly environment could be a nice and challenging testbed with ~ photorealistic rendering.\n\nThe paper also lacks details on the computational requirements for training policies with the VLM backbones (required GPU + training time), which seems crucial given the focus on making VLM policies more accessible.\n\nFinally, Section 5.5 on open-loop execution lacks some detail on what exactly was tried, so I was a bit confused about these experimental results (see questions below)."

How can you open-loop execute the policy without re-training?\n\n\n## Review Summary\n\nOverall I think this paper is an interesting contribution to democratizing the access to large vision language models for policy learning. I believe that many in the community will be interested in this and thus recommend acceptance. However, the empirical analysis in the paper could be significantly improved by addressing the points raised above. Concretely, the authors can:\n- add details about the required compute\n- add comparison to co-finetuning and full model finetuning\n- add comparison to other pre-trained representations\n- add evaluations on at least one additional environment"

It could be interesting to show the validation curve over time and potentially perform early stopping?\n\nFor the IKEA furniture env: note that there is a new version of the environment -- even though it's focused on real world execution, it also comes with a simulated version of the environment and offline data for imitation I believe (https://clvrai.github.io/furniture-bench/)\n\nThe compute requirements are a bit disheartening to see -- a 8xA100 (80GB) server should be able to perform full finetuning for models in the 7-13B scale with proper FSDP. For making these models truly accessible, pushing the compute requirements down to ~1x48GB GPU would be ideal so I'd encourage the authors to further push to reduce the requirements.\n\nI will maintain my score and recommend acceptance due to the relevance of the research to the community."

                "value": "Firstly, the presentation of the paper can be improved, and some parts of the method is unclear, which hinders reader's understanding.\n- According to Section 4.2.2, the finetuned language model backbone will output a fused vision-language representation $X_t^L=\\{x_{t,1}^L,\\dots, x_{t,M}^L\\}$ for *each* time step $t \\in [1...T]$, where $M$ is the length of the input language instruction $l$. To produce such outputs, it seems necessary that the same language instruction needs to be tiled $T$ times and fed into the language model for a sequence of $T$ images. However, such detail is not illustrated in Figure 2, and Figure 2 only illustrates the model behavior when $T=1$. It would be a lot more helpful if Figure 2 illustrates model behavior when $T>1$. \n- Sec. 5.4.2 of the ablation study shows that \"loading the pre-trained parameters of the cross-attention layers\" is crucial for model performance. From which model are these cross-attention layer weights being loaded? Also why not load the perceiver resampler weights from a pretrained model? In addition, the design to load pretrained cross-attention weights is never described in the methodology section.\n- In Section 5.4.3, what is the setup for the \"instruction fine-tuning\" experiment? I also didn't find the descriptions for the instruction finetuning designs in the methodology section.\n\nSecondly, authors choose to only train RoboFlamingo on the CALVIN benchmark throughout the paper. Even though authors claim that they want to showcase RoboFlamingo's ability to produce good language-conditioned manipulation policies given a small amount of finetune data, I'm afraid that by only finetuning on the CALVIN benchmark, the model overfits to the dataset and loses some crucial abilities like spatial reasoning and object relation understanding (which may be crucial for other robot manipulation tasks that are not present in the CALVIN benchmark). By training RoboFlamingo on a mixture of downstream robot datasets and large-scale datasets used to pretrain e.g., OpenFlamingo, InstructBLIP, IDEFICS, LLaVA, authors might alleviate such phenomenon, and even improve upon the CALVIN benchmark performance they achieved in this paper. Therefore, I do not quite agree with the author's claim that \"only a minimal amount of data is required to adapt the model to downstream manipulation tasks\"."

This sentence is inaccurate. The author's proposed approach still need to understand language instructions as the LLM backbone still needs to fuse language representations with visual input representations. I believe the authors' actual meaning is that the policy head does not explicitly take language instructions as input."

                "value": "- RoboFlamingo outperforms considerably prior methods on CALVIN\n- Requires much less data and compute than methods like RT-2 that co-train on extensive internet-scal data.\n- Decouples perception and policy to enable flexibility like open-loop control, while maintaining relatively strong zero-shot generalization ability."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- Relies on simulated robot environment, may be challenging to transfer to real world.\n- The evaluation is limited to a single simulated benchmark environment (CALVIN). Testing on more diverse robotic platforms and tasks in simulation could help validate the generalizability of the method.\n- Less sample efficient than methods leveraging offline robot data like MCIL."

How realistic are the CALVIN simulations?\n- Is there scope to incorporate offline robotic data to improve sample efficiency?\n- Experiments are with visual and language modalities. Robotic manipulation often relies on additional sensing (e.g. force, tactile). How can RoboFlamingo incorporate other modalities?\n- How flexible is the decoupled design? Will it be possible to incorporating RoboFlamingo into hierarchical frameworks like in PaLM-E?\n- How does the computational overhead of RoboFlamingo compare to other VLM-based methods?"
