The approach adds a weighted average of retrieved passage representations into the CLS token representations. These representations can be ranked by a learned weighting scheme or a learned mask over dimensions. For ReFusion, this choice is made by a search module. Overall, ReFusion does well in evaluations, and the paper includes valuable ablation studies that help us understand which pieces contribute most. Those studies suggest that the search component is especially important."

Section 3.3.1 creates on set of expectations, and section 3.3.2 does not seem to meet those expectations, or even respond to them directly. In particular, we are led to believe that the search module will decide what method to use on a per-layer basis, but then it seems to turn out to be a global choice. But I many well simply not be understanding the description and its connection to the experimental results."

The retrieval module retrieves relevant sentences, then reranker reweighs retrieved representation, and finally, search module finds suitable fusion module for each layer. At inference, the search module simply picks a module with the highest score and utilizes the module for inference."

Given that retrieval-augmented language models are often specifically leveraged for their prowess in knowledge-intensive tasks, a direct comparison in this primary use case would be valuable.\n\n3. Compatibility with Current Language Models: Modern language models, such as GPT-4 and LongChat, are designed to handle extended sequences, which facilitates the use of context augmentation methods. However, the representation fusion approach proposed by ReFusion necessitates fine-tuning of language models. This requirement may not be compatible with the current trend of employing language models as 'black-box' functions, where fine-tuning is either not possible or practical due to access or resource constraints."

Towards this, at first, top-k similar sentences are retrieved using an online retrieval module; thereafter, based on the neural architecture search (NAS) optimal ranking scheme, several modules are replaced with either fusion module with the reranker-based scheme, the fusion module with the ordered-mask-based scheme, or the original module. Authors have conducted comprehensive experiments across 15 NKI tasks comprising 8 single-sentence tasks and 7 sentence-pair tasks. Experimentations are performed using the RoBERTa LMs where ReFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 tasks over 8 single-sentence tasks and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 tasks over 7 sentence-pair tasks. The study of the averaged performance reflects ReFusion is unbeatable in any of the cases over all 15 NKI tasks. Authors have also performed an ablation study to understand the importance of the sub-components, and the results reported validate that combining different ranking schemes on different tasks is necessary. Moreover, ranking schemes are not always suitable for every layer in LMs. Therefore, ReFusion disables the fusion module at some layers, thus integrating all effective candidate fusion modules."
