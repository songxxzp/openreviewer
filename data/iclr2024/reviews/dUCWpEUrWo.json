AGG represents observations as nodes within a dynamic graph, enabling it to perform data imputation through transductive node generation without relying on recurrent components or assumptions about temporal regularity. It incorporates measurements, timestamps, and metadata as learnable embeddings within the nodes and employs attention mechanisms to capture expressive relationships among these variables. AGG implicitly learns a causal graph representation of sensor measurements, which can be used to predict new measurements based on unseen timestamps and metadata. The text discusses comparisons with previous work and the positive impact of data augmentation, highlighting AGG's state-of-the-art performance in time series data imputation, classification, and prediction across benchmark datasets like Beijing Air Quality, PhysioNet Challenge 2012, and UCI localisation."

While AGG is shown to outperform existing methods in certain scenarios, a more comprehensive evaluation, including a broader range of datasets and potentially varying levels of data complexity, would bolster the paper's credibility. Additionally, insights into the computational resources required for AGG and any potential scalability challenges should be addressed. A more detailed discussion of the trade-offs between model complexity and performance gains would also be valuable for readers seeking to understand the practical implications of implementing AGG in real-world applications. Overall, expanding the experimental analysis and providing a more nuanced discussion of the results would further strengthen the paper's contributions and impact.\nIn addition, there are opportunities to enhance the paper's presentation. For instance, there could be clearer explanations of the acquisition system's workings, the data preparation process, and the interpretation of colors (e.g., green and yellow) in Figure 2."

                "value": "1. As the key advantage of this work (when compared to the current baselines) is the use of attention, I think it is problematic that the authors have not compared extensively to attention-based temporal data imputation techniques. Particularly, [1] seems to be a very similar model and work, as they also evaluate on the same datasets. See their Table 1; AGG outperforms theirs in 10% and 50% missing data for PhysioNet, but they claim superior performance for 90%. The Beijing Air Quality data seem to be scaled differently, but you should also compare to their result.\n\nIn summary, a comparison should be made empirically and the differences in the methodology should be highlighted to other attention-based works for data imputation in temporal data.\n\n\n2. The ability to impute continuous-time data is emphasized early in the paper, but then is not exploited in the experiments. While it is clear that this method outperforms discrete-time methods, I think a comparison to continuous-time imputation techniques would be insightful. For example, it seems GP-VAE does not use RNNs, and may also not require time discretization. You could hypothetically decode the Gaussian process to arbitrarily-time outputs, and compare more directly to your approach. Similarly, while there is not extensive literature on point process models for data imputation, they represent another class of continuous-time model which could be used to impute missing temporal data. For example, [2] introduces the PILES model for such a task. See also [3] Section 5.4.\n\nIn summary, I think an emphasis on the ability of your method to address continuous-time data imputation could address some limitations and similarities between other attention-based approaches. Additional experiments could highlight the true novelty of this approach, which I believe to be an attention-based method for **continuous-time** data imputation.\n\n\n3. It seems a strong assumption that the time and (especially) metadata of unknown targets are known - can you demonstrate the ability to predict the metadata, at least? Regardless, I think it is a bit of a limitation that the timestamp of the imputed observation must be provided.\n\n\n4.

See a couple mentioned in this survey paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03759) and more below. In particular, the development in the field since 2022 is barely discussed.\n\n2. Problem setup: \n\n- Section 3.1 introduces the problem formulation, which however is unclear to the reader. For example, is the imputation task focusing on predicting $y$? This seems to be the case as shown in Eq (12). If so, how does this differ from a standard prediction task? \n- As the authors claim \"no previous GNN-based method approaches the imputation problem\nfrom the perspective of an asynchronous graph\", it is important to separate alone a section explaining the formal mathematical setup of the problem, which at least contains (1) the imputation problem (2) how this is asynchronous (3) why the problem is challenging/unique that others have not proposed ways to solve it. The current Section 3.1 is highly insufficient.\n\n3. Experiments (existing results):\n- I find it strange to say \"a common AGG architecture was implemented without hyper-parameter tuning for all datasets\". Does this mean your method can always work without any tuning, even for learning rate/batch size, etc.? If not, it would be important to say clearly the implication behind this.\n- Related to the first point, how does your method perform under various hyper-parameters, if they are actually tuned? Would it be significantly improve over current results?\n- How does your model capacity compare to those of the baselines? Your model has 378k trainable parameters. How about others? What architecture of theirs is adopted in the comparison?\n- The appendix should contain a table highlighting the data specifics (e.g., number of observations, number of time-series, feature dimension, etc.), as it is hard to infer these values from looking at Appendix A.1. I would suggest the authors to list these numbers in accordance with notations in previous sections. Similar thing can be done when explaining the AGG architecture.\n\n4. Experiments (new ones currently lacking):\n- The most recent baseline is SSGAN (Miao et al., 2021). However, many works have followed theirs; a quick search reveals [1-5] for the imputation task, while I believe more are existing. I thus find it unrealistic that the SSGAN is still the \"state-of-the-art\" method after two years. \n- How does the method perform on other time-series datasets? The current experiments closely follow SSGAN, but it would be important to examine beyond that setting established more than 2 years ago.\n\n(Incomplete) list of related papers\n- [1] Miao et al., 2021: Efficient and effective data imputation with influence functions\n- [2] Cini et al., 2022: Filling the G_ap_s: Multivariate Time Series Imputation by Graph Neural Networks\n- [3] Alcaraz et al., 2023: Diffusion-based Time Series Imputation and Forecasting with Structured State Space Models\n- [4] Liu et al., 2023: PriSTI: A Conditional Diffusion Framework for Spatiotemporal Imputation\n- [5] Wu et al., 2023: Jointly Imputing Multi-View Data with Optimal Transport"

                "value": "This paper studies the challenge of analyzing multi-channel time series data, particularly focusing on issues like irregular time intervals and complex spatial-temporal relationships. It proposes a novel approach with the Asynchronous Graph Generator (AGG), a graph neural network architecture that models time series observations as nodes on a dynamic graph, facilitating data imputation and prediction. AGG's unique feature is its ability to directly embed measurements, timestamps, and metadata into nodes, using attention mechanisms to discern intricate relationships among variables \u2014 which can hardly convince the reviewer \u2014 and as claimed in the paper, this method stands out from existing models by bypassing the limitations of recurrent neural networks and conventional time series models that often assume temporal regularity."

                "value": "The reviewer can hardly say that they can understand the paper's method. But the idea that representing a multivariate time series as nodes in a graph is truly interesting. Even though the reviewer is not familiar with the baselines in this field, the experimental results seem relatively comprehensive and convincing."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The reviewer can only offer some general suggestions:\n\n1. The reviewer believes a good research paper should be educative to general audience; they did look at Cao's work on RNN for time series imputation and find their problem set-up and  proposed approach easy to understand. Unfortunately, the current form of this paper makes it really difficult for readers without certain background knowledge to understand the setting and the contribution.\n\n2. Given that this paper is purely empirical, the numerical experiments are the most important part to verify the performance. Table 1 may benefit from including uncertainty quantification (in the meanwhile, the reviewer acknowledges that the improvement is quite significant).\n\n3. Terminology should be used more carefully: the term \"causal\" is used multiple times (and perhaps that is the reason why the reviewer gets invited to review this paper); However, it seems that \"causal\" merely refers to temporal order, which is \"Granger causal\" and means correlation from past to the future. The reviewer suggests using simple terms like temporal order directly.\n\n4. Scaling might be one major issue when the dimension is high and the time horizon is long (since there must be a really huge graph to represent the multivariate time series)."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "There are two major concerns that make the reviewer lean towards rejection of this work:\n\n1. In Fig. 1 (c), the proposed method used future to predict past. The reviewer is fine with using the expressive power of neural networks to learn a latent causal representation, but a structure shown in Fig. 1 (c) seems to imply that the latent data generation mechanism depends on the future which is clearly wrong. Can the authors justify that?\n\n(PS: in granger causal literature, one famous example is that \"buying Christmas tree\" Granger causes \"Christmas\". However, this example cannot justify the proposed structure since there should be a latent variable \"knowing Christmas will be on 12/25\" captured by the latent data generating process).\n\n2. Another reason why the reviewer gets invited to reviewer this paper might be the use of Physionet dataset \u2014 the are a lot of lab tests in that dataset where missing values themselves mean that the clinician is not suspect of related dysfunction/disease at all. That is why there are so many missing values in that dataset \u2014  a single patient cannot be suspected to have all diseases \u2014 and the missingness carries meaning. Can authors justify on why imputing this dataset?"
