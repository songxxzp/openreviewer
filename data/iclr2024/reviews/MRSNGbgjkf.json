It's quite confusing. I can only get the idea when I read the later parts of the paper. What does mean by introduced supervision S. T is an integer, not an interval, right? What value can T be selected? T should be factors of N?\n\n     - \"However, in the past early exit scenarios, the heavy misalignment of path to obtain Y^_i and Y^_{i+1} may cause optimization direction interference intrinsically\" I don't get the main point of this sentence.\n    - \"while the shallow features are used for late classification and early decision both\", what do late classification and early decision mean?\n    - theorem should be rigorously proved but theorem 2 is just a statement \n    - \"generalization ability of shallow layers should be enhanced\". generalization of deep layers should also be enhanced right?\n    - typos: Dyn-Adpater should be Adapter\n    - There are two rows for Dyn-XXX in table 1. The author should explain what they are in the caption.\n\n\n- Some statements in the paper are not clear and confusing. \n    - \"By freezing the backbone and only updating the adapter to assume the task-related semantic abstraction, we guarantee that the low-level feature in the backbone will not be interfered by loss signal, realizing explicit decoupling of low level feature and high level semantics.\"  Updating adapters of shallow layers will change low-level features. I don't see how updating adapters can guarantee that the low-level feature in the backbone will not be interfered by loss signal. How can updating adapters fix the problem that early classifiers\nforce intermediate low-level features to encapsulate high-level semantics and be linearly separable?\n    - \"Nevertheless, current PETL methods are only capable of tuning the high-level semantic representations and can not directly utilize low-level information in case of the demand of down-stream tasks, thereby undermining their capacity to adapt to diverse datasets.\" Because of the skip connections in transformer blocks, prediction can also use the features from the shallow layers [1].  \n    -Because of theorem 1, the authors proposed to use MLP for early stages and light-weight head for later stages. What\u2019s the logic and rationale behind it? \n    - For Adaptive Prioritization, does it mean that the lambda needs to adjust manually during the training? The description of the adjustment is very vague, \"progressively increase, gradually declines\".  How much does it increase/decrease, and how often? The authors need to make this part more clear. \n\n\n- The increase in the number of parameters is quite significant. 75% for adapter, 59% for LoRAm, and 73% for Repadapter in table 1. In table 5, the number of parameters is doubled. \n\n\n- Related work. Multiple works have proposed to leverage intermediate features in PETL or transfer learning [2, 3, 4].

Their novel approaches exploits a simple yet efficient dynamic mechanism, by freezing the backbone and only train the adapter.
