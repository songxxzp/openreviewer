Rather than focusing on the original posterior, the authors augment it with an auxiliary variable.This augmentation results in a joint distribution with marginals corresponding to the original posterior and a smoothed version of it, achieved through convolution with a Gaussian kernel. The joint distribution's particular structure facilitates straightforward sampling using the stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that acquiring samples from both marginals during the test phase leads to a diverse set of samples that effectively capture the characteristics of flat basins."

Towards the end of section 4.1, the authors mention that \"$\\theta_a$ provides additional paths for $\\theta$ to traverse, allowing $\\theta$ to reach flat modes more efficiently.\"  However, this argument is not rigorously reasoned in the paper. The only support for this claim seems to be the synthetic examples in section 6.1, which is purely empirical and can have some issues (see Questions section). In my opinion, this claim needs careful theoretical reasoning (even though it can be challenging due to the need to understand the mixing speed of the MCMC chain in non-log-concave settings). This is crucial since it is a key motivation for the methodology. A possible direction to look into is the generalization bound of SGLD, as mentioned in reference [1].\n\n[1] Wang, et.al. 2021, Analyzing the Generalization Capability of SGLD Using Properties of Gaussian Channels"

It is also important to explain why choosing an initial point on this ridge does not favor one mode over the other.\n\n- Regarding the MCMC algorithm used in the synthetic example, details about variance parameter $\\eta$, number of MCMC iterations, and step sizes are necessary.  Results from Figure 2, 7, and 8 seem to suggest that both SGLD and EMCMC does not mix-well. \n\n- And it would be better to elaborate why the result is independent to the choice of $\\eta$? (To my understanding, if $\\eta \\to 0$, the smoothed target will be identical to the exact target, so no effect on \"biasing towards the flat region\", and with excessively large $\\eta$, the convergence of the MCMC will be very slow.) It will also be helpful to visualize the slice of the target density and smoothed target density (with various choice of $\\eta$) on the slice of (x, x).\n- This could be due to my limited understanding to Bayesian NN: For the image classification experiement, how do you compare the results obtained from sampling-based and optimization-based algorithm? Specifically, do you obtain certain point estimates of NN's weights from MCMC samples, and compute metrics on test dataset using NN with the estimated weights?   \n- Is there a systematic way of choosing the variance parameter $\\eta$?"

When we talk about sampling we usually aim to sample from the true underlying distribution, including both the flat basins and the sharp nodes. However, it seems in the context of this paper, it is perfectly fine to be stuck at a good flat basin without ever exploring around the sharp nodes. Moreover, Theorem 1 presents a convergence result, implying that the marginal distribution of \\theta should eventually converge to the true posterior distribution, but this means it would have to eventually visit the sharp modes. Moreover, if the initial samples are concentrated in the flat basins as claimed, doesn't that mean later there would be a period where the sampler stays around the sharp nodes? Is this because of the strongly convex assumption for Theorem 1? If this assumption is violated, to what extent does the sampler still converge to the true posterior distribution? Should I take the theoretical results as establishing the local convergence rates once we are near a mode?\n\nIt would be helpful if the authors can clarify the above issue. I am also curious to see a simple new experiment where we run EMCMC on a distribution like the one shown in Figure 2 for a really long time to see whether EMCMC would come back to the sharp mode and stay there for a while."

The overall goal is to adapt SGD with information about the local flatness of the optimization landscape in order to find local minima in flatter regions of the loss landscape, which are widely believed to have better generalization properties compared to sharp local minima. The key technical insight is that the computational difficulties encountered applying local entropy optimization in previous works can be avoided by performing joint MCMC on the energy term inside the local entropy integral, whose marginal distributions correspond to the original Bayesian posterior distribution and the local entropy posterior distribution respectively. Joint sampling allows the local entropy weight path to facilitate movement of the original weight path. A theoretical analysis shows the proposed method has more favorable convergence rates than prior local entropy optimization methods in the strongly convex setting. Experiments show that the proposed method finds local minimum which exhibit greater flatness according to the eigenspectrum and interpolation/extrapolation experiments, and that the proposed method boosts validation accuracy compared to SGD and related entropy-based optimization methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet."

Why does $\\eta$  in Eqn 21 disappear during integration?\n\nIt is not clear how data augmentation influences the empirical performance of the method.\n\nIt would be nice if the authors provided some arguments why the introduced concepts are mathematically well-defined, e.g. (4) integrates to a finite quantity (seems straightforward but the finiteness of all quantities should be ensured).\n\nWhy do authors consider the assumption 1? I.e. it's fair to say that authors what to perform the inference in the augmented model, specify the prior/likelihood and there's no need to introduce the assumption 1 (make it a remark).\n\nIt's difficult to judge the practical utility of theoretical statements.\n\nIf my questions are addressed I'm willing to increase my score."
