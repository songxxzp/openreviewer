                "value": "The authors make a novel hypothesis about the way in which deep neural network weights dynamically evolve during training: \"weights can be clustered into a very few highly correlated groups\" (Hypothesis 1). The authors illustrate support for this hypothesis by examining the training of several different types networks on several different tasks, using post-hoc correlation based clustering. The success they found on these examples motivated them to develop an online method, which reduced computational demands and led to better accuracy than state-of-the-art low dimensional training methods. Lastly, the authors provided initial results on improving federated learning (and lowering computational costs) via their method."

The hypothesis of highly correlated modes fits well within existing work (which the authors cite well), but is a highly novel discovery. This makes it impactful and interesting. \n\n3. The results the authors achieved are impressive. They performed better than standard methods of training, and achieved state-of-the-art results among low-dimensional training methods. They tested on a variety of tasks (including federated learning, which - the authors say - makes it the first use of dynamical modeling to reduce communication overhead). \n\n4. The Appendices are full of examples, pseudo-code, clarifying remarks, and extra details. This is a very packed paper."

                "value": "I found no major weaknesses of this paper. \n\nHere are a few points that whose clarification will enhance the quality of the paper: \n\n1. The notation used in Sec. 3.3 (Online CMD) is a little difficult to follow. Additionally, because the use of online CMD to train DNNs had been foreshadowed in earlier parts of the paper, I was confused by the lack of details on how the individual modes were trained - which was answered in Sec. 3.4. Explicitly mentioning, in Sec. 3.3., that more details are coming on the actual training are coming in Sec. 3.4, would help remove this momentary confusion. \n\n2. I did not understand the comment \"Even though $\\tilde{A}_m$ is re-evaluated at each time-step $t$, each $a_i, b_i \\in \\tilde{A}_m(t)$ are fixed scalars.\" (Sec. 3.3). Is this pre-empting the point made in Sec. 3.4 that, once embedded, a weight's $a_i, b_i$ are frozen? \n\n3. I felt like Sec. 3.5 (CMD Accuracy and Loss Landscape Visualization) is too quickly presented. What is the main takeaway? That you can use CMD to visualize the landscape, or that CMD training does a good job of finding the optimal parameters? Maybe this would be better in the Appendix?\n\n4. I think the work on federated learning is very interesting and a great application of the approach. That being said, I did feel like the explanation of the approach was a little rushed (possibly due to lack of space) and Eq. 16 was a bit confusing. Improving the discussion around Sec. 4 would be helpful (and could be aided by putting Sec. 3.5 in the Appendix to get more room). \n\nMinor Comments: \n\n1. The acronyms in Table 2 should be clarified (I assume Mom is momentum but what is SCH?). \n\n2. Could you use DMD/Koopman methods to predict how the individual modes are going to evolve, thereby reducing the computational cost even more? \n\n3. The comparison of DMD with CMD in Fig. 1 is insightful. Recent work has found that using Graph Neural Networks can lead to better approximations of the Koopman operator, specifically for the training of DNNs [1]. Do you think the correlated modes you discover might explain this improved success (e.g., the GNN is able to better learn the correlated modes)?\n\n4. There are several places where the first quotation marks in a quote are backwards. This can be remedied by using `` instead of '' in Latex.  \n\n5. In Fig. 2, CMD is compared to GD. Should this be SGD?\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09060"

Using correlations between (the entire histories of) learning dynamics of each parameters, the proposed method first divides the set of parameters into several clusters (called modes),  identifies one representative parameter from each modes, and then represents the other parameters in each mode by scaling the representative and adding a bias. The paper also provides an online version of the dimensionality reduction (Online CMD) that can be used without memorizing the history of parameters during training, which still requires training of all parameters, and a parameter-efficient version (Embedded CMD) that enables us to reduce the number of trainable parameters gradually during training. The paper also propose to use the dimensionality reduction of learning dynamics for distributed learning. The paper empirically shows the superiority of CMD against standard training and the state-of-the-art methods of dimensionality reduction."

In each mode block in Figure 1 (Left & Middle), correlation between most of parameters tends to be less than 1.0, which does not satisfy the hypothesis behind the proposed method: `Any two time trajectories u, v that are perfectly correlated can be expressed as an affine transformation of each other`.\n    2. The y-axis in Figure 1 (Right) is unclear.\n    3. What are the different/common points between CMD and DMD? The paper highlights CMD vs DMD in Figure 1, but any description for DMD is not provided.\n    4. Any theoretical evidence of Hypothesis 1 is not provided.\n    5. `Figs. 1, 6 demonstrate that Eq. (2) accurately represents the dynamics using a notably small set of modes` in Section 3.1 is overclaimed due to W1-1 and W3.\n    6. Accuracies plotted in Figure 2 (Left) seem inconsistent with the corresponding accuracy in Table 1. It is also weird that test accuracy of CMD is consistently higher than training accuracy of CMD in Figure 2.\n    7. The author claimed that `we observed that the reference trajectories can be selected once during training, and do not require further updates`. However I could not find such results in the paper.\n    8. In Table 1, it is weird that CMD significantly outperforms full training (GD) although CMD is designed to approximate GD. At least, CMD should be worse than GD in training accuracy if CMD behaved as a regularizer as the authors claimed. If CMD outperforms GD even in training accuracy, I'm concerning that there should be some leakage or bug in experiments.\n2. Experiments are limited on a single toy dataset CIFAR-10. I'm concerning whether the proposed method still works well on more large-scale, difficult learning tasks.\n3. Since CMD identifies only single representative for each cluster, the method only leverage proportional relationships between parameter dynamics, which may lead to very limited expression power of the reduction method, especially in more complex learning scenarios."
