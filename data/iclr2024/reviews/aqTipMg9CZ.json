It should be compared to demonstrate the effectiveness of reconstructing reaction centers instead of just learning from chemical formulas.\n- In Table 1, it would be more convincing why fingerprint-based methods outperform deep models [2].\n- In Table 2, comparing Mole-BERT and GraphLoG will be helpful since those methods outperform GraphMVP in Table 3.\n- In Table 4, why many baseline models in previous tables are missing? Overall, various self-supervised learning methods should be compared in all tasks since they can be applied to all tasks.\n- Moreover, in MolR [1], they have a task for chemical reaction classification, which aims to predict the reaction class that a chemical reaction belongs to. It would be great if REMO outperforms MolR in the task, thereby demonstrating the superiority of MolR in understanding underlying chemical reaction knowledge.\n\n[1] CHEMICAL-REACTION-AWARE MOLECULE REPRESENTATION LEARNING, ICLR 2022.\n\n[2] Why Deep Models Often cannot Beat Non-deep Counterparts on Molecular Property Prediction?, arxiv 2023.\n\n3) No codes are available."

The argument for that is in this way, the model can exploit underlying shared patterns in chemical reactions as context and can infer meaningful representations of common chemistry knowledge.\n\nThe main motivation for the paper was that  the traditional masked reconstruction loss is not enough for molecules due to:\n1)  the \"activity cliff\" property of molecules, where a single molecular change could lead to a big difference in the molecule property, the standard self-supervised learning techniques fall short when applied to molecules.\n2) BERT-like masked reconstruction loss omits the high complexity of atom combinations within molecules in nature that are quite unique compared to a simple sentence comprised of a few words.\n\nTherefore, instead of sub-units,  they proposed to reconstruct the reaction center from the given reactants as context. \nThis is due to the fact that molecule biochemical or physicochemical properties are determined and demonstrated by its reaction relations to other substances."

In table 1, I was wondering why REMO_IM model is not presented but only REMO_I and REMO_M? This also extended to Table 2, here the REMO represents the model trained to do the reaction center reconstruction task, the identification task, or both.\n\n3. From Table 3, it seems often the model trained for reaction center reconstruction does not have as good performance as the one trained to predict the reaction center, any insights on this?\n\n4. Regarding the baselines for the drug-drug interaction task, I was wondering what happens if one uses simply the graph formed without self-supervised learning, what would be the result? I think one main baseline missing from the paper here is, what happens if we do not use self-supervised learning, but directly use the proposed graph network structures to do the task, would the result be a lot worse than having the self-supervised learning setup? \n\n5. Regarding the reaction center identification task, as the output is softmax over all the atoms, you will have a vector of [p_1, p_2,,, p_N] where 0<=p_i<=1,  what happens when you have multiple reaction center, maybe the answer to this question is very obvious but I am somehow failing to see it clearly."

This is a particularly challenging fine-tuning scenario, I agree on that. However, in pre-training the goal is to learn a generally good embedding space which can be easily adapted in various fine-tuning scenarios. In fact, in unsupervised learning more generally (i.e., not transfer learning), a uniform space is considered as goal in many papers. It is not clear to me how an embedding space needs to look like so that it is particularly beneficial also in AC scenarios. If the authors consider those, a more detailed investigation might be useful.\n- Table 1: I think the baselines are too basic and thus unrealistic, the SOTA is more advanced, e.g.\n    - ECFP: might be a concatenation of ECFP+MAACs or even additional, helpful descriptors rdkit provides\n    - GAT, GCN, etc. are all models from the GNN literature. There are others, e.g., D-MPNN (chemprop), which target chemical tasks.\n- My current main concern is the experiment design, which is not fully clear to me.\nThe Table 3 comparison may be lacking. Since there are no ablation results in terms of masking, I assume the authors intended to compare this in this table as well (i.e., beyond just comparing to SOTA works in general). The baselines from related works seem to be trained on other data. However, even if these are larger datasets, they do not necessarily have to be better. In fact, USPTO contains highly diverse, special data from patents. So it is not directly clear to me that this dataset is comparable to the pre-training data the other models use. Therefore, it is not at all clear how the proposed masking actually compares to related works. It is also not clear from the table if the REMO_x models are based on GIN or Graphormer. Only if the former is the case, the comparison to most of the baselines makes sense to me, in terms of masking."
