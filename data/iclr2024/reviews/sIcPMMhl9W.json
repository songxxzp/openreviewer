Section 2 is a review of the message-passing approach to the linear assignment problem, but the relation to the present problem is not motivated beforehand. Moreover the relation between the purely random and the planted version is not clear, and I don't think it is possible to understand the reasoning in Sec. 2.3 that leads to theorem 1, on which the rest of the results of the paper relies, without reading the original paper [Semerjian et al (2020)]. The Appendix A which seems to be aimed at clarifying this derivation remains quite obscure.\n\nOne of my main concerns is the use of theorem 1 in a setting where it does not apply: in [Semerjian et al (2020)] the weights on the edges of the graph are independent by construction, which allowed to write the recursive distributional equations (7). But here the weight matrix E=X B  has strong correlations in the edge weights, it is not clear why these should be neglected. The manuscript states on page 8 that in the \"non-oracle case\", \"Unlike the oracle case, we notice the edge weights Eij are strongly correlated\", but isn't it already the case that in the oracle case these are correlated ?\n\nThere are also imprecisions in the use of the \"phase transition\" phrasing, since there is not a clear description of the qualitative differences between the two phases that the transition should separate, and since a study of the effect of the system size on the sharpness of the transition is not presented in the main part of the text."

It is indeed quite surprising: from the beginning of the Section one understands that the \"statistically optimal\" estimator would involve solving a QAP, which is not doable efficiently, so how can one asserts that the LAP reaches statistical optimality if the latter is not known?\n\n- on page 14, in the description of the numerical procedure, I'm not sure that it is the dichotomy search that should be expanded upon, but rather what corresponds to the line 5 and 6 of algorithm 1. What is meant by \"run experiments\", the resolution of the LAP? With an exact algorithm or via message passing? Could you also specify the definition of the error rate, is it the fraction of samples on which the inferred permutation fails to coincide with the planted one, or the average fraction of the permutation that is correctly inferred? This last question applies as well to the y axis on the lower panels of figure 2."

                "value": "The paper's primary focus is the analysis of phase transition thresholds within the context of recovering the permutation matrix in shuffled regression, as described by the model $Y = \\Pi X B + \\sigma W$. To achieve this, the paper employs techniques derived from message passing algorithms. The central goal in the paper is to establish phase transition thresholds by assessing the signal-to-noise ratio ($\\text{snr}$) in two distinct scenarios. In the oracle case, the matrix $B$ is assumed to be known, while in the non-oracle case, $B$ is considered unknown. The derived thresholds serve as critical points where the error rates for permutation matrix recovery sharply drop to zero when the signal to noise ratio exceeds a certain threshold. Numerical results confirms the accuracy and reliability of the theoretically derived phase transition points in both the oracle and non-oracle cases."

                "value": "The paper showcases notable strengths, particularly in terms of its technical contributions. It is the first work that leverages the framework of message passing algorithms to derive phase transition thresholds for shuffled regression. \nFurthermore, the section dedicated to related work is thoughtfully presented and offers a clear and comprehensive overview of the existing literature."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The paper's motivation could benefit from a more explicit and clear description. While the challenges of the problem are well-defined, a paragraph highlighting the practical applications of shuffled regression would greatly enhance the paper's appeal. Providing real-world scenarios where this problem arises would place it within a broader context of applicability and increase its relevance.\n\n- Additionally, I would suggest reorganizing the notation-heavy equations, starting with equation (4) and its subsequent equations regarding message flows right until message passing update equation. Improved organization and perhaps some explanatory text would enhance the overall readability of the paper."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "- The paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the relationship between the permutation recovery problem and the linear assignment problem as defined in Equation (2). Providing more context on how the linear assignment problem is connected to the ML estimator for permutation recovery would be beneficial. The sudden introduction of the linear assignment problem might be confusing to readers initially. Additionally, it would be helpful to include a note regarding the operational significance of the matrix $E$ and why it plays a crucial role in this context.\n\n- The derivation of the lower bound for $\\log \\mathbb{E}e^{-\\theta\\Xi}$ on page 6 is not clearly explained. Providing a more detailed and comprehensible explanation of how this lower bound is derived would greatly enhance the paper's clarity.\n\n- Given the significance of the Gaussian approximation in obtaining closed-form expressions for $\\text{snr}$, it would be valuable to provide an intuitive explanation of why this approximation is effective. \n\n-  The paper imposes a condition on the ratio of the singular values for matrix $B$ when computing $\\text{snr}_{\\text{non-oracle}}$. An explanation for the rationale behind this condition would be beneficial."
