                "value": "This paper discusses the concept of Continual Federated Learning (CFL), a real-world scenario where new tasks emerge over time in a decentralized data setting. In CFL, the main challenge is Global Catastrophic Forgetting, where the performance of the global model on old tasks deteriorates as it is trained on new tasks. While previous works have attempted to address this problem, they often rely on unrealistic assumptions about past data availability or violate privacy principles. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a novel method called Federated Orthogonal Training (FOT). FOT works by extracting the global input subspace of each layer for old tasks and modifying the aggregated updates of new tasks in a way that ensures they are orthogonal to the global principal subspace of old tasks for each layer. This reduces interference between tasks, which is the main cause of forgetting. Empirical evidence shows that FOT outperforms existing continual learning methods in the CFL setting, achieving better average accuracy and lower forgetting while incurring minimal computation and communication costs."

This similarity is evident in the equations provided \u2013 Eq 8 and 9 in the GPM paper and Eq 12 in the current paper.\nI acknowledge that this paper introduces an additional layer of aggregation, which generates $A^l$ through secure aggregation in the context of federated learning. However, it's worth noting that secure aggregation inherently lends itself to operations such as summation or averaging. Consequently, I am inclined to question the extent of the technical contribution and novelty offered by this paper. Please correct me if I misunderstand something."

In my understanding, n corresponds to the number of data in every client. Then what is the number of data in your experiments? For the 100 clients' experiments, is there enough data? If not, how do you explain the effectiveness of the FOT?\n2. Authors said that they used the same round number for different methods. How did you decide the round number? Did other methods converge earlier than the round number?\n3. According to the description of the FOT, to me, it seems like that FOT would also work well if we only apply this to several layers in the model. Have the authors tried this?"
