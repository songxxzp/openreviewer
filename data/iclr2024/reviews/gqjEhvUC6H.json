Therefore, it is somewhat straightforward that more descriptive captions from recent LLaVA models would be effective. Furthermore, as the authors themselves pointed out, the concept of using LLM-generated captions has already been proposed in LaCLIP. Moreover, the effectiveness of using both LLaVA and LLaMA is unclear. See question 2.\n\n   2) In DCTM: Previous works like OSCAR [1], ALBEF [2], and BLIP have empirically shown that diverse captions (one image with multiple captions) from sources like COCO and Flickr are effective in enhancing performance. These works treat each image-caption pair as unique; for instance, if one image comes with five captions as in the COCO setting, they construct five distinct pairs. The difference in the current approach is the use of diverse captions with a multi-positive contrastive loss. However, it remains unclear where the benefits of this approach specifically originate from. See question 1.\n\n   3) In MSTM: The utility of uni-modal contrastive losses in improving performance has already been showcased by ERNIE-VIL 2.0 [3].\n\n\n[1] Li, Xiujun, et al. \"Oscar: Object-semantics aligned pre-training for vision-language tasks.\" Computer Vision\u2013ECCV 2020: 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, August 23\u201328, 2020, Proceedings, Part XXX 16.
