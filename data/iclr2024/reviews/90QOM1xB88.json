It proposes what they coin \"refined exponential solver\": an exponential integrator that satisfies the prescribed order conditions.\nExperiments demonstrate that the proposed solver is more sample-efficient than the DPM-Solver++ (by Lu et al.

For example, compare Section 3 to the paper by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005):\n\n* Lemma 1 is equivalent to Equations 4.9 to 4.12 in the paper by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005) (in fact, the \"proof\" in Appendix B.1, introduced as a \"key theoretical result\" by Appendix B, is an almost verbatim reproduction of Section 4.1 in the mentioned paper but without marking this reproduction as such).\n* Theorem 1 is a version of Theorem 4.2 by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005); Theorem 2 is a version of Theorem 4.3 by Hochbruck and Osterman (2005).\n* Proposition 1 paraphrases Theorem 4.7 by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005).\n* The second-order Butcher tableaus in Table 3 are Tables 5.3 and 5.4, and the third-order tableaus are Table 5.9 (RES) in the paper by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005).\n* The observation that the algorithm which the submission called RES outperforms the DPM-solver++ has also been made (and mathematically underpinned) by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005; Figure 6.3).\n\nSee also the survey article by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2010) and the references cited by both works.\n\n\nIn my view, the fact that the analysis already exists reduces the paper's contribution to a point where it should be rejected.\nAdditionally, I find it problematic that the analysis is presented as new instead of attributing the results to the original works, even though the authors seem to be familiar with the paper by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005) (the submission cites it on page 18).\n\n**References:**\n\nHochbruck and Ostermann: Explicit Exponential Runge-Kutta Methods for Semilinear Parabolic Problems.
