The selection of POLA vs alternative LOLA extensions is justified, but I am unsure how M-FOS is neglected when it has also been demonstrated to be effective at the coin game? Furthermore, the choice to only evaluate against POLA on the coin game is limiting, when full-history IPD and chicken would be equally interesting and strengthen the results.\n2. The scaling performance of LOQA would be better demonstrated by including further, more complex environments, rather than just scaling up the grid size of the coin game. Since previous LOLA extensions have been prohibitively expensive, this has not been possible, but it appears LOQA runs in a very reasonable amount of time on the largest of these tasks. This gives the opportunity to demonstrate LOQA on a \"more complex and realistic scenario\", rather than just extrapolating from its scaling performance here.\n3. Whilst the training dynamics of POLA are consistent across seeds, LOQA seems to have significant variance (Figure 4). The number of LOQA seeds should be increased beyond 3 to handle this variance."

The advantage of this algorithm is that it can achieve performance comparable to POLA (previous state-of-the-art of the family) but faster, which also improves scalability to bigger environments.

                "value": "1. There are several papers in literature that provide decentralized algorithms to achieve individually and socially optimal solution in sequential social dilemmas. One of the criticism of these papers is the additional information needed by these algorithms, which is often not available in the real-world. This paper also has the same limitations. \n2. I think the novelty in the proposed method is limited based on the papers cited by it. The key idea is that each agent model the opponents policy using the rewards obtained by the opponents."

                "value": "1. Can the authors concretely define \"partially competitive settings\"?\n2. What is the information structure assumed for each agent? If each agent can see the entire world state and also observe the actions of the other agent, then the policy for each agent should also depend on the history of the actions of the agents in addition to the current state for no loss of optimality.\n3. How can the opponent's true Q function be replaces with an estimate by the agent? Are we assuming that opponent observations and rewards are common information in the game? This is often not the case in real-worls multi-agent settings.\n4. It is not clear if LOQA will extend to all general-sum games. Also, the sub-optimality for each agent due to the modified objective function needs to be quantified and bounded. Are the authors proposing LOQA only for sequential social dilemmas?\n5. Can the authors establish or reason about the solution concept achieved using LOQA? Will it be a socially optimal solution. In non-symmetric games what will be the extent of sub-optimality for each agent?\n6. By modifying the objective function (returns) optimized by each agent, LOQA changes the underlying game. Can the authors show that a Nash equilibrium (or any refinement of it) of this modified game is a socially optimal solution of the original game?\n7. Also, will decentralized REINFORCE algorithm lead to attaining a Nash equilibrium in the above-defined modified game?\n8. How does this analysis extend to the case when all agents in a game are using LOQA?"
