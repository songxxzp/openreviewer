I have some hesitations around the results and comparisons (see weaknesses), which is why I steer away from strong accept, but I believe these results and contributions to be useful for ICLR community as a whole.\n\n### Originality\n\nThe proposed idea is new, and a surprisingly simple to implement. The work done for evaluation is also novel in this exact setup. The idea of using demonstration-conditioned policies is not novel per-se, but is under-explored compared to using reward signals or simple human feedback.\n\n### Quality\n\nThe results are solid: the paper presents a new (large) benchmark for testing models in the studied setting, and compare the proposed method against baselines, outperforming them with a clear margin. The experiments also push the method's limits with longer horizon tasks and ablate results, and also study the learned embeddings/model.\n\nCompared to some other Minecraft results in recent years, all results were done in the \"hardest\" Minecraft version (one used by OpenAI VPT), without using additional helper information.\n\n### Clarity\n\nPaper is well structured and readable, however the amount of content makes it slow to digest (see weaknesses).\n\n### Significance\n\nI believe many readers in this field (conditioned agents in complex environments) would find these results useful, and would build upon the proposed method. The included benchmark is useful for future exploration to this field as well."

                "value": "### Flawed comparisons to baselines\n\nWhile STEVE-1 text/visual comparison is valid, being also goal conditioned policy, VPT models are not conditioned in any way. While it provides a decent \"unconditioned baseline\" result, it is not surprising that conditioning the policy improves the results. However, this is somewhat minor weakness, as there are no other baselines in the field.\n\n### (Minor) Some uncertainty around the results\n\nFigures 5 and 6 have rather high error bars which could indicate that results are not significantly different (see questions). Also, there are some questions around the evaluation and inference setup (see questions), which reduces my confidence in the results. However, overall, I believe the results hold and find the proposed architecture beneficial.\n\n### (Minor) Generalization\n\nMethod was only tested on one (but complex) environment, and the tasks provide initial tools already (and the tasks are rather short-horizon). However these are more of ideas for future work than real weaknesses of the work.\n\n### (Minor) Clarity\n\nThe paper is slightly hard to digest, but I feel this is mostly due to the amount of content (new model, human evaluation and new benchmark). Some details were kept in the appendix or missing (see questions).\n\nI'd suggest proof-reading the paper for typos (e.g., Figure 5, \"Comparision\" -> \"Comparison\", or Page 9, \"Minecraft is attracting increasing researchers\". This should probably be \"Minecraft is attracting _an_ increasing _number_ of researchers\")."

Did they have previous experience with Minecraft? Did they get to practice Minecraft? What instructions were they given for data collection / evaluation, during and prior the data collection? Were human participants made aware how the data collected will be used (i.e., for AI research)?\n2) What are the error bars in Figure 3a? I understood the ELO rating is deterministic (given the set of comparisons/results), and does not model the uncertainty.\n3) Figure 5 and 6, what are the error bars (and can you report N in the caption, I believe it is 25)? While there is trend that one is higher than the other, the scale of noise makes me wary of the results.\n4) Was the night vision effect also added when VPT and STEVE agent played? They were not trained with this effect enabled, which might have skewed their results (but I do not expect huge change).\n5) Do you have ablation results for the logit-substraction trick described in Appendix C.2? You highlight it as an important change, but it is hard to tell how important it is given there are no results reported for this change.\n6) How did you determine 1500 pairwise to be sufficient for the ELO rankings? I assume the ranking did not change towards the end of the collection. However, I'd recommend you to also see if other metrics like TrueSkill would paint the similar picture. TrueSkill is much like ELO, but also tracks uncertainty of the rankings.

                "value": "1. The modeling method for video instruction in this paper is innovative and can improve performance. However, since the low-level controller still needs to select task-related videos as instructions when performing specific tasks (Section 5.1), it cannot be well adapted to LLM-based planning agents. Although the video instructions used are generated from other biomes, it only proves the controller's generalization ability in specific tasks, rather than the generalization ability for video instructions.\n- Can the authors validate the controller's generalization ability for diverse tasks by providing relevant video instructions for unseen tasks and skills? This would be of great significance for the integration of LLM-based planning agent capabilities.\n- If GROOT is combined with a high-level planner, how would it construct video instructions?\n- For the results in Figure 7, how are the two video instructions of GROOT specifically input to the controller? Is it directly combined and input, or is the video switched manually after reaching the specified depth?\n\n2. Although the paper often emphasizes learning from gameplay videos, the inverse dynamic model (IDM) is based on VPT, and there is a lack of discussion on IDM. Therefore, I believe that the essence of this paper is to use task-related state sequences as instructions and train a goal-conditioned policy. Using state sequences as instructions/goals for training agents is not uncommon. Methods such as GATO[1], AD[2] directly input demonstrations as token sequences into transformers, while [3] uses VLM to extract video information. Even without imposing constraints on the goal space, agents can exhibit good performance. The authors should compare or discuss these methods.\n\n3. As shown in Figure 5, if the video contains multiple goals, the performance may be affected. Would this lead to more stringent requirements for video quality during application?\n\n4. In Figure 6, when the KL loss is ablated, the performance decreases. Can the authors provide a visualization of the goal space without KL loss to explain its contribution to the agent's generalization in the goal space? As a significant part of the main contribution, the KL loss needs to be analyzed in more detail.\n\n5. Additionally, there are several unclear descriptions in the paper that may affect the understanding of the method.\n- In Section 3, symbols like $\\theta$ lack explicit definitions.\n- In Equation 13, why does log $p(a_\u03c4|s_{0:\u03c4})$ depend solely on the environment dynamics?\n- In Section 4.1, what does \"a set of learnable embeddings\" specifically refer to?\n- How is the segment length T set? Is there only a single goal within each segment?\n- In Equation 3, is the policy goal-conditioned?\n- There is a lack of detailed description for the baselines, as well as an explanation for why VPT(rl) would achieve the worst results.\n\n---\n\n[1] Reed, Scott, et al.

                "value": "It\u2019s interesting that conditioning on multiple videos concatenated together can drive the agent to accomplish multiple tasks simultaneously, and the embedding space seems to be qualitatively meaningful. Do the authors think there would also be a benefit to constructing synthetic clips concatenating multiple tasks and training on them as well? Even if the source video settings look very different (potentially making goal-space learning harder), it might be an interesting way of generating large amounts of interesting synthetic, multi-task data."
