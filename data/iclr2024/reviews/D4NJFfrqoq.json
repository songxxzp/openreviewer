Or can we run multi-objective BO to solve it?\n2. I\u2019m surprised to see definition of regret in eq (3) by combining objective function evaluation together with constraint violations. They may sit in totally different function ranges. Let F denote the range of objective function and let C denote the range of constraints. If C is much greater than F, then regret has little information about convergence. Also, the optimal point x* is defined w.r.t. objective function and $r_c$ is independent to x*. Why is $r_c$ is part of the regret?\n3. How do you solve optimization problems in Line 3 and 4 in Algorithm 1? Definition of $O_t$ seems like making solving Line 3 intractable."

The definition of regret is unconventional and lacks sufficient discussion. Typically, in the CBO setting, the reward is only defined within the feasible region, as there is no reward incurred by querying the points that are infeasible. The regret here is defined on both the objective and constraints, which circumvent the problem of infinite instantaneous regret in cumulative regret analysis when querying points out of the feasible region.\n\n**References**\n[1] Gotovos, Alkis. \"Active learning for level set estimation.\" Master's thesis, Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule Z\u00fcrich, Department of Computer Science,, 2013."
