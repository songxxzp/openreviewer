                "value": "**Unclear motivation**: Similar to DPS [1], the proposed method (SHRED) also solves IR tasks in an optimization manner. The main difference is, DPS [1] optimizes the intermediate result $\\mathbf{x}\\_{t}$, but SHRED optimizes the initial noise $\\mathbf{x}\\_{T}$. I wonder what are the benefits of optimizing $\\mathbf{x}\\_{T}$ ? This article does not clearly point out SHRED's advantage, and it does not compare with DPS [1]. Besides, the authors claim that \"This design choice does not alter the intermediate diffusion latents and thus provides more guarantees that the generated images lies in the in-distribution manifold\", which lacks experimental or theoretical support. For example, the visualization of the optimized $\\mathbf{x}\\_{T}$ is necessary to judge whether it lies in the in-distribution manifold. \nIn summary, the necessity and superiority of this method are questionable.\n\n**Insufficient experiments**: (1) No reports of PSNR. (2) Lack of comparison with optimization-based methods, e.g., DPS [1], GDP [2]. (3) The description of the experiment is not detailed enough, making it difficult for researchers to make effective evaluations based on the experimental results. For example, Table 3 does not tell the SR scale and the total steps for other methods. (4) Since SHRED seems to have a longer backpropagation chain than DPS [1], it may have a larger memory consumption. It would be better to compare the memory usage.\n\n**Objectivity**: Lack of discussion of limitations.\n\n**Typos**:  There are many typos in this article. The authors need to check carefully. For example, \"the generated images lies in the in-distribution manifold\" should use \"lie\" rather than \"lies\"; Errors in labeling the best and second best methods in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Chung et al.,  Diffusion posterior sampling for general noisy inverse problems.

Thus, techniques such as the one proposed constitute a valuable effort to tackle this problem.\n- The paper is more or less clear and easy to follow, with some issues of equation formatting and typos."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The proposed method is computationally very costly. The outer optimization needs to differentiate through several (n = 10+) chained calls of a large score model in each iteration, with an overall N (N=100+) outer loop iterations, per image. Thus, it requires at least 1000 NFEs plus the heavy cost of N backpropagations through a large, chained model.\n- There are lots of hyperparameters that need to be tuned (step size, N, $\\delta t$) and as the optimization needs to be solved on a sample-by-sample basis it is not clear how much variation in optimal hyperparameters can occur. \n- I have serious doubts about the experiments:\n    1) There is no comparison with DPS which is a well-known diffusion-based solver that has better performance than the included competing techniques and source code is made public. For instance, for 4x SR *with noise* DPS reports far better LPIPS than any techniques in this paper. \n\n    2) Distortion metrics such as PSNR, NMSE and SSIM are completely missing, which are crucial in evaluating inverse problem solvers.\n\n    3) A very small (100) number of samples is used for evaluation. In other competing methods it is standard to use a 1000-sample validation split. Thus the results are not necessarily reliable and it is very difficult to compare to existing published results (DDRM, DDNM, DPS). Furthermore, since FID heavily depends on the number of samples used in the generated distribution, the reposrted FIDs are not compatible with the ones reported in competing method's original papers.\n\n    4) I have doubts about the reported timing results in Table 3. SHRED is reported as approx. 5x slower than DDRM. According to the DDRM paper, they use 20 NFEs. How is the reported timing possible, when SHRED uses 100 outer loop iterations with 10 NFEs in each outer loop (total 1000 NFEs) plus the additional cost of 100 backpropagation? \n\n    5) The robustness experiments could be more rigorous. Instead of showing some good looking samples, it would be more meaningful to quantify the variation of image quality metrics for the validation dataset over 5-10 samples.\n\n    6) The framework is developed for noisy inverse problems, however there are no experiments for the noisy case. Reconstruction performance under measurement noise is crucial in evaluating the utility of the algorithm."

However, the paper lacks a rigorous demonstration or proof that the samples generated by SHRED indeed lie on the data manifold. This is a significant gap, as the main criticism of prior methods is their potential deviation from the manifold. To strengthen this claim, the authors could provide empirical evidence or a theoretical guarantee, possibly through visualizations of the manifold or quantitative measures that can assess this aspect.\n\n2. **Comparison with MCG from Chung et al. (2022b):**\n   - The paper does not provide a detailed comparison with the MCG method proposed by Chung et al. (2022b), which also aims to correct samples to ensure they are on the data manifold. A deeper theoretical and empirical analysis comparing SHRED with MCG would be beneficial. This could include side-by-side comparisons on the same tasks, using the same metrics, and a discussion on the theoretical underpinnings of both methods. Such a comparison would be valuable for readers to understand the relative merits and trade-offs of these approaches.\n\n3. **Computational Efficiency:**\n   - In Table 3, SHRED is slower than DDRM and DDPM, which could limit its practicality for real-world applications where computational resources or time are constrained. The authors could explore ways to improve the efficiency of SHRED, perhaps by optimizing the algorithm or by proposing a more computationally efficient variant that maintains most of the method's benefits.\n\n4. **Novelty and Originality in Mathematical Derivation:**\n   - The mathematical derivation of SHRED's methodology does not appear to be a novel contribution, which may lead to questions about the paper's originality. The authors could strengthen this aspect by clearly delineating the novel components of their mathematical approach, contrasting it with existing methods, and discussing how these novel aspects contribute to the method's performance."

Current diffusion model-based methods for image restoration modify the reverse sampling process to satisfy consistency with the corrupted input image. However, this can cause the generated image to deviate from the true data distribution (According to the authors). The proposed SHRED avoids this issue by casting image restoration as an optimization problem over just the initial noise vector that is input to the diffusion model. To make this computationally feasible, SHRED utilizes the ability of DDIM to skip ahead in the diffusion process with large timesteps. This allows efficient inversion of the diffusion model for optimization. SHRED is evaluated on image inpainting, super-resolution, compressed sensing, and blind deconvolution tasks."

The method described in the paper is not complex; it essentially pertains to an optimization-based inversion method supplemented with some implementation tricks. However, the paper is very difficult to understand. It requires multiple readings to identify the important optimization objectives and to guess the optimization methods. Figure 1 is also difficult to comprehend. Section 3.1 seems unnecessary. The authors need to carefully revise the structure of the paper to improve the efficiency of information delivery. The current version is not suitable for publication.\n\nSecondly, there is a large body of literature related to GAN inversion that has not been discussed. Many existing works are actually very relevant to the methods of this paper, but they have not been carefully considered.\n\nLastly, the experiments presented in the paper are somewhat insufficient. There is no quantitative data supporting the discussion on the blind problems. Moreover, the paper's inversion method seems to not address the prompt issues of the diffusion model.\n\nOverall, the method described is rather simple and intuitive. My rating is not based on the method. There needs to be a description of an optimization-based diffusion inversion technique. However, the manuscript is not adequately prepared at this stage. This is the main reason for my negative review."
