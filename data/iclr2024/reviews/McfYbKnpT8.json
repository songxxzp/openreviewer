This neural network is trained using the solutions found from simulated annealing (SA). The SA takes too much running time to be used for practical cases, but the trained neural net, whose output will mimic the result of the SA, can get the job done very fast, allowing for both good speed and good performance."

The presolving of the MIP solver is a routine that simplifies the MIP instance, enabling the succeeding main solving routine (e.g., B&B) to operate more efficiently. Current presolving routines are hard-coded and rely on expert knowledge, making them unable to account for instance-wise differences in MIP problems. L2P employs a supervised learning method to predict the best presolver routine while using the result of a powerful yet time-consuming search method as the training label.\n\nUsing the trained model, L2P proposes tailored presolving routines for each instance in fractions of a second. Such tailored routines lead to a significant improvement in MIP solving performance. The proposed L2P consistently demonstrates performance gains in various MIP datasets while requiring a negligible amount of presolving parameter suggestions."

An ablation study to evaluate the impact of KRL would be informative.\n\n4. **Experimental Details:** The number of instances evaluated in Table 1 is unclear. More detailed comparisons, including the time taken during the Running Step for each method, would strengthen the results section.
