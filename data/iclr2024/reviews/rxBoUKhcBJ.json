It applies a $d \\times d $ trainable linear transformation $W$ on the output word embedding, by which the embedding $e$ of each word is replaced with $e + \\epsilon W e_v$. It explains the feasibility of LM-Switch from the perspective of Hidden Markov Model, and obtains guarantees for continuous control and compositional control through its linearity properties."

                "value": "The major weakness of this paper is its evaluation.\n\n- The evaluation is too simple and unrealistic to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method LM-Switch. First, the three tasks in the evaluation are binary tasks. This allows for picking positive and negative values of e to control. Thus, it\u2019s unclear whether the LM-Switch generalizes to non-binary tasks.\n\n- While LM-Switch achieves a better Max Toxicity score than other models, the fact that the soft-blacklist method is doing well might suggest that the testset for toxicity is simple.\tMoreover, it looks like the results from other methods are quoted in the paper instead of direct comparison by implementing those methods on the same GPT-2 base-model. This leads to unfair comparison.\n\n- There is no human evaluation. Note that for language generation tasks, it is important to have human evaluation as we can\u2019t trust automatic metrics. DExperts paper has human evaluation for both language detoxification and sentiment control. The political stance study in this paper is not systematic and based on some cherry pick examples. Having said that, without properly running human evaluation, it\u2019s unclear how good LM-Switch is.\n\n- The GPT-2 large model has only ~800M parameters, which is considered small by today's standard. Thus I do not find the argument about parameter efficiency in the paper is convincing. Why not apply the proposed method for Llama-7b or Llama-65B models?\n\n- How does LM-Switch change the behavior on language generation after being tuned for binary tasks? The paper said LM-Switch maintains balanced generation quality but it is evaluated using only perplexity. For a language generation application, I could imagine a prompt such as \u201cwrite a review criticizing a movie X but in a positive tone\u201d, how does the model behave in such a case? \n\n\nOther minor weaknesses:\n\n- The paper claims LM-Switch is theoretically grounded by analyzing HMM. But HMM is completely different from autoregressive LM and analysis on HMM with markov assumption is not true on LM unless it\u2019s proven directly for autoregressive LM."

There are many implementation possibilities and options for LoRA based finetuning but I am not sure from the writeup if this aspect was tuned to get a strong LoRA baseline.\n\n\u2013 The paper only performs quantitative comparison on two surface-level controlled generation tasks. Although this is mentioned in the appendix, it does not consider other controlled generation tasks, especially the ones which require manipulation of deeper attributes in language.\n\n\u2013 MuCoLa is tested as a baseline for detoxification but not for sentiment-controlled generation.\n\n\u2013 Although the paper emphasizes that the proposed approach makes it easy to compose different control attributes, I am unable to find adequate evidence of such compositional control abilities in the results. Relatedly, figure 2b is difficult to understand and I am not sure how exactly it relates to compositional control abilities.\n\n\u2013 The connection of neural autoregressive LMs to HMMs is tenuous but the manuscript overstates this relationship. Practically, finite state HMMs are not as expressive as neural LMs. Moreover, finding a clean transformation of the HMM state space to a neural autoregressive LM\u2019s vectors is non-trivial and typically intractable. Therefore, the motivation of the approach via HMM hidden state representation feels forced and disconnected. Moreover, the assumptions underlying the theorems are too unrealistic. Unless I missed something, more convincing evidence should be provided to justify the validity of the assumptions.\n\n\u2013 Assumption 1, eqn 2: what does the variable \u201ch\u201d mean?"
