The method works by adding two new modules to standard learned video compression architectures. The first module is a \"rate allocation\" module, which attempts to get the average rate for a mini group of pictures to match the overall target rate specified by the user. The second module is a \"rate implementation\" module, which outputs frame-dependent lambda parameters for controlling the trade-off between rate and distortion. In numerical experiments the paper shows that the new rate control module effectively alters the rate for a suite of learned video compression methods from previous papers. Furthermore, the rate control scheme actually yields an improvement in BD-rate performance for all the methods."

Please elaborate more on this, given that many learnt methods available to achieve the rate control for learnt video compression, e.g., [1]. \n2. The proposed method is trained in separate stages, which are with limited contributions by my side. It is the fact that many rate control methods aim to fit closed-form mathematical models, e.g., R-\\lambda, R-\\rho and R-Q models. The proposed bit-rate allocation module essentially can be regarded to learn to implicitly fit the R-\\lambda model. If so, the comparison with closed-form models should also be reported, for example, against HEVC and VTM as also mentioned in the paper.\n3. I am surprised by the reported experimental results, whereby the RD performances could be further improved by adding rate control scheme. The target bit-rates were obtained by optimizing R+\\lambda D with constant \\lambda, which means the achieved D now should be the lowest distortion given the target bit-rate R and constant \\lambda. The proposed method controls the bit-rates by adjusting \\lambda, which in my opinion is supposed to perform inferior to the non-rate-control method. Why adding rate control can further improve the RD performance?\n\n[1] Mao, Hongzi, et al. \"Neural Rate Control for Video Encoding using Imitation Learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.05339 (2020)."
