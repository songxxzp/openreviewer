At the server, they distill an ensemble of models from client fine-tuning and the previous server round into a new server model. At the client, they distill the initial (l.e. server) model into the fine-tuned model. The distillation additionally weights the logits based on (aggregated) client label counts."

Based on the story of the paper I would expect adding local distillation to be the most important factor.\n\nFigure 2 would be more helpful if you use the same initial model for all methods.

I believe the manuscript should be more specific in this statement or, hopefully, perform a more systematic exploration of what really affects forgetting in FL.  \n- In the same line, the paper defines, measures and tests local forgetting. Later on, it concludes that some amount of it is necessary for learning. This conclusion is valuable, but this nuance is not reflected in the introduction nor in the motivation of the manuscript. \n- There is little discussion of the public data used by the algorithm until Section 5.1. Even then, I am left with questions regarding how it can affect the forgetting behavior. What distribution does this data need to be drawn from? Can it exacerbate forgetting if drawn from the wrong distribution?\n- I am surprised that several baselines did not converge for FEMNIST in Table 1.
