Given a shape in its discrete representation as a n-dimensional simplicial complex, ECT computes a descriptor that is a function of a direction and the height function for the topological filtration. The idea is to project the simplices of the shape in all directions and compute the topological property of those directional signatures. Taken together, all these signatures can be concatenated and used together as a global shape descriptor. The main contribution in this paper is to rewrite the ECT in terms of an indicator function (Equation 5), that can be relaxed into a differentiable formulation using the sigmoid, leading to DECT.\n\nThe authors have shown a series of experiments to show the benefits of their approach. Table 1 demonstrates a simple proof of concept that DECT classifies shapes of different topologies. Section 5.2 demonstrates how to use it as a loss as well as optimize the descriptor for best directions and section 5.3 for their use in classifying geometric graphs.  Generally, the experiments make a favorable proof of concept."

Despite the simplicity and comparable accuracies of Table 2, it would be nice to be more direct in explaining what features of data are simply not achievable using standard feature descriptors and how the proposed contributions alleviate it. \n- More significantly, I see no baseline comparison with other prior topological descriptors. For eg, how do some of the methods in: (Hajij et al., 2023; Hensel et al., 2021,  (Moor et al., 2020; Trofimov et al., 2023; Vandaele et al., 2022) compare with the proposed construction in section 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3?  \n- It would be valuable to elaborate more concretely on the multi-scale aspect of the descriptor.

How can this be alleviated in the current framework? \n- Please annotate/reference the direction and height components in the image of Figure 2, to make it clear. \n\n\nOverall I am on the border for this paper. On the positive side, the paper has been compiled well and the main idea has been enumerated and experimented as a good proof of concept. However, the lack of comparison with conceptually similar baselines is a strong drawback, and more generally the wider applicability of the method is not promoted well.

Wouldn\u2019t this break permutation invariance? \n\nA discussion about limits is missing.  For instance, since performing sums over simplices, the method is probably dependent on the sampling density. This is particularly relevant for PC classification. The authors also briefly mention the rotation equivariance of the method, but this is not elaborated much. For instance, if the network is invariant w.r.t. rotation permutation invariance, wouldn\u2019t it make the model also rotation invariant (this probably depends also on the distribution of angles)? \n\nMy last concern is about the experimental part.
