Specifically, the authors considered a new scenario, i.e., deep regression task, where the output of the model is a vector instead of discrete output in the deep classification task. For instance, in a deep regression task, called gaze estimation, the deep regression model will output a vector to represent the direction of one person view. In this new scenario, the existing related work will not work since some of them [(Wang et al., 2019] recovered a suspect trigger signal for each class, and then determine the true trigger from all suspects. However, the existing works cannot be directly used in deep regression tasks since the defender cannot the infinite outputs. The main contribution of this work solves this problem."
