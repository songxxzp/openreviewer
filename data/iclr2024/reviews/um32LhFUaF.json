This is quite unnatural to me; the key to the proposed method is leveraging what instance segmentation does to the semantic segmentation task. Since the relation of the proposed method to instance and segmentation methods is not described clearly, it is difficult to assess the value of this study correctly.\n\n\n### Experiment\nThe experiment seems problematic. The paper uses SemanticKITTI and Waymo Open Dataset for comparison, and both experiments have potential issues as follows:\n\nSemanticKITTI:\nThe paper only compares old baselines (before 2021) except to LidarMultiNet (Yu et al., AAAI2023). However, Yu et al. did not show an experiment for SemanticKITTI in their original paper (this may be natural since this method was developed for the Waymo competition), and thus, it is unclear if this method achieves SOTA performance to this dataset.\nActually, through the recent leaderboard, we see that several recent methods (after 2022, without using extra training data) dominantly outperform (test mIoU > 70) the proposed method (65.0).\nhttps://paperswithcode.com/sota/3d-semantic-segmentation-on-semantickitti\n\nWaymo Open Dataset:\nFrom the original paper of LidarMultiNet (Yu et al., AAAI2023), we see the authors fail to reproduce the original results. The paper reports approx 70% mIoU, but the submitted paper reports 65.24. Since the code is not publicly accessible, the performance degradation may be possible if the authors reimplemented Yu et al.'s method. \nHowever, since what the original paper reports are the values from the official leaderboard for the Waymo's competition. Readers consider the methods on the leaderboard to be fairly evaluated, and the reported accuracy is not in question (i.e., we don't need to reimplement the method) as we use the same experimental setting as the official competition. Also, we can see many methods outperform the proposed method in the official leaderboard.\nhttps://waymo.com/open/challenges/2022/3d-semantic-segmentation/\n\nTherefore, I cannot conclude that the proposed method achieves SOTA performance in the 3D semantic segmentation task. I understand that achieving SOTA accuracy is not the primary goal of academic study. However, the submitted paper argues a contribution that the proposed method achieves SOTA, which is invalid, and they should seek other ways to show their technical contribution."

                "value": "I am a bit confused about the instance extraction. I can come up with two interpretations:\n\n1. The ground truth semantic labels are used by the clustering algorithm to segment the point clouds into object instances at the beginning of training. This is done once and not repeated. OR,\n\n2. The predicted labels are used to recompute the predicted instances at each step of clustering. These predicted instances are compared to ground truth labels and instances for the losses.\n\nI think the correct interpretation is (1). But just in case it is (2), how are gradients computed given the mean shift clustering step in the middle? I assume that every time the weights are updated during training, the predicted point labels change and the clusters need to be updated before the losses can be computed.\n\nIf indeed it is (1), then the focus of the method on large urban point clouds is clear: classical clustering algorithms work especially well when the clusters are well separated. The assertion that the method is \"almost unsupervised\" w.r.t. instance labels is a bit specious then, since this is a very favorable case for instance extraction. However, I am curious if the method could still work on more tight layouts like part assemblies of single shapes.\n\nApart from this question, I don't have significant methodological concerns. My main issue is with the scale of the contribution. Instance/part-level losses are not entirely new, e.g. old papers such as Kumar et al., \"OBJ CUT\", CVPR 2005 or newer ones like Zhu et al, \"AdaCoSeg\", CVPR 2020 or Sizikova et al. \"Structure-Aware Shape Synthesis\", 3DV 2018. While the general idea of applying instance-level losses is well-justified, I am not sure whether this is enough to push the paper over the acceptance bar given that the technical details (i.e. the classification/reconstruction heads), while reasonable, are not particularly surprising or insightful by themselves."
