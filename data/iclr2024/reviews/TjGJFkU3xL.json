The authors demonstrate that this estimator is a consistent approximation of the influence function. They also introduce an innovative method for efficiently resolving nuisance functions. Additionally, the paper includes an in-depth convergence analysis in relation to the mean square error.\n\nThe paper proposes a novel and intriguing problem within the proximal causal learning framework.  Despite the motivation not being particularly compelling, the problem itself remains highly intriguing and of considerable importance."

It might be more appropriate to refer to the function derived in this paper as the efficient influence function, given that the previous doubly robust estimator for binary treatment is efficient.\n\n* The empirical coverage probability is not given. MSE only contains both bias and variance terms, which may not display the true statistic estimation acuraccy and precision."

So please make the motivation clear about why this paper does not focus on the inference issue.\n* Why does the projected residual mean squared error make sense? Does it mean \\hat{q} is consistent for q0?\n* this paper seems to consider the high-dimensional setting in experiments, what about theoretical properties?"
