This minimization error should be considered which I envision will involve the parameterization error $\\nu$ plus the error rate of the corresponding convex unconstrained optimization. In addition, for the stochastic version of Algorithm 1, the error of $\\widetilde{\\ell}_i\\approx \\ell_i$ should also be considered in line 4, not just in the dual update step in line 5. \n\n(1.2) The error of $f_{\\theta}(t)$ as well as $\\widetilde{\\ell} _ i\\approx \\ell _ i$ will also cause the approximation error of $g_p(\\lambda(t))\\approx\\widetilde{\\ell} _ 0[f _ {\\theta}(t)]+\\lambda(t)^{\\top}\\widetilde{\\ell}[f _ {\\theta}(t)]$ for selecting the best prima iterate.

I think this is possible by using the existing convergence rates on the convex constrained optimization problems in terms of the constraint violation (like $\\sum _ {i=1}^m \\alpha _ i\\max(\\ell _ i, 0)$ for some constants $\\alpha _ i>0$) as well as optimality.

Is this found by you or previous literature? If it is found you, you could provide examples to support your claim and emphasize this claim as one of your novelty.

If not, you could explain the meaning of $\\phi(\\lambda_p^*)$ in the paper. \n\n(5) In paragraph 2 of Section 3.2, it may be clearer to change ''We will first provide a result assuming this curvature is known'' to something like ''We will first provide a result with the following assumption on the knowledge of this curvature'', so readers can relate to Assumption 3.4.\n\n(6) After ''The second one captures the effect of parametrizing the hypothesis class for a fixed dual variable.'', you could add something like ''We will elaborate these perturbations in Section 3.3.1 and Section 3.3.2 respectively.''\n\n(7) In the experiment, \n\n(7.1) What negative likelihood function $\\ell _ 0$ do you use (or the distribution of $x, y$)?

Experiments also verify the theoretical conclusion.\n\nUpdate:\nI read the rebuttal. I found the contribution that this paper bounds the optimality gap which is not generally known in convex case, and the way it handles constraint and shows that the primal convergence, which does not in nonconvex case in general, is important. I raise the score to 8 while not having checked all details.\n\nBut I still wonder how good the approximation of the functional class is, i.e., how big is the distance from any function to a function in the parameterized family that the training algorithm is in, and how training error indicates the test error when one has finite samples but a parameterized family to train on being very large. With that, I do not raise confidence and do not raise score to 10."

The paper attempts to bound the error in the constraints of the relaxed solution using the dual variables. The approach is based on an infinite-dimensional (not parameterized) formulation/relaxation of the dual problem in which the bounds are obtained. This provides a bound on the error in the infinite-dimensional primal problems and the results are used to bound the error in the actual solution to the primal using the actual finite-dimensional dual ascent."

In an attempt to be perfectly general, it is hard to state exactly how the results apply to any particular learning problem. One would think that algorithms based on neural networks would perform quite differently than a kernel-based approach using a single poorly chosen kernel. And yet the results don't seem to account for such differences in any way. Additionally, this makes it hard to understand if the 7 (mostly regularity) assumptions are valid and what the corresponding parameters are."

                "value": "Specific concerns and questions are listed as follows.\n\n1 Please more clearly spell out the motivation in the context of fairness of including the constraint vs. just not including data on the protected classes.\n\n2 \"$\\mathcal{F}_\\theta$ can be a neural network\" -- First, its a set, not a network. But remind me -- in this case will the hypothesis space be convex? Also, take the extreme case of a single arbitrarily chosen Gaussian kernel. Is there not some problem with fragility/generalizability? Performance on untrained data? How does this approach account for the robustness of the parameterization? Maybe this relates to the question of which topology is being used to characterize Lipschitz continuity.\n\n3 The Lipschitz and convexity are defined using $\\ell$ which is a statistical function. Would it not be more suitable to define them using the actual functions, $\\tilde{\\ell}$?\n\n4 Not much mention of the primal-dual gap and whether it is significant in parameterized or unparameterized problems\n\n5 Generally bothersome to have lots of assumptions unless it can be shown they are satisfied in certain basis and useful cases.\n\n6 I'm not sure exactly the point of Section 3.3.2 -- Are we saying that the bounds can be improved by making the constraints strict?\n\n7 \"We will denote by $\\hat \\ell$ an estimate of $\\ell$ using the dataset D....\" First, redefining $D$ casuses confusion. Also, how is this now a dataset? Also, this brings up the $\\ell$ vs $\\tilde{\\ell}$ issue again -- Alg 1 is defined using $\\ell$ and not $\\tilde{\\ell}$. What is $D^*_p$ in Lemma 4.1 -- clearly not related to D.... Actually it seems there are lots of $D$-based notation in this paper.\n\n8  \"We train this model over T = 400 iterations using a ADAM\"  Acronym undefined -- maybe they mean Adam, which is an algorithm. What is $\\ell$ here? Are the Assumptions satisfied? What are the obtained bounds?\n\nMinor corrections are as follows\n\n- Page 1 - \"In fact, this problem is even hard from\" -- which problem?\n\n- Notation $D_{KL}$ on Page 2 is undefined.\n\n- \"guarantees usually pertain a probability distribution over\"\n\n- Assumption 3.2 is unclear. What is $f_\\theta(\\lambda)$ here? It becomes more difficult to interpret the results after this.\n\n- \"the unparametrized Lagrangian minimizer is unique\" -- presumably this is the solution for the unparameterized version, $D_u$?\n\n- \"unparametrtized\"\n\n- Assumption 3.4 seems difficult to verify...\n\n- Thm 3.5. This is difference between the constraint functions, not their violations since $\\ell_i$ are not non-negative.\n\n- Page 12, after Defn A.1. Some conflation of operator $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ and its representor, $g$.\n\n- Defn A.3 -- what does it mean for $h(x)>-\\infty$? \n\n- \"Linear independence constraint qualification (LICQ)\" -- capitalization issue...\n\n- \"Thus, it can be thought of as the baseline effect\" --  define \"it\"... What is the third component -- I see only two.\n\n- \" Combining the bound in equation in equation 6 with\"\n\n- numerous problems with bibliography entries.\n\n- Proofs in appendix need better organization. No explanation or connecting verbiage is given. For example, Appendix A.6"
