The authors need to survey and compare more papers published in 2022 and 2023. \n\n- Missing middle-scale datasets. The authors should explore the dataset size boundaries of the statics deep graph clustering methods.\n\n- The chronological order training is a strong restriction. I\u2019m concerned that such as this strong strict will limit the performance on some datasets. As I know, some methods can disrupt the graph structure for training. \n\n- In Figure 11, point out which sub-figure represents the result on which dataset. Besides, ablation studies should be provided in the main text. Figure 2 is too small. In addition, there seems to be something wrong with the commas.\n\n- Have you considered explaining the relationship between the number of nodes in the static graph and the number of edges in the temporal graph further?

The authors argue that their selected datasets are more suitable for temporal graph clustering tasks. However, it seems that it is not true. As we can see in Table 1, most of the selected datasets have very limited timestamps, which is not consistent with their claimed continuous-time dynamic graphs. They are more like discrete-time dynamic graphs. For example, the DBLP, arXivAI and arXivCS datasets usually contain publication year only. \n3)\tThe comparisons of GPU memory usage are not fair in Figure 2. The authors only compare their TGC with static deep clustering baselines that feed whole graphs. The authors should compare their TGC with existing temporal graph clustering baselines like HTNE, TGAT, JODIE, etc. The low consumption of TGC largely depend on its backbone model HTNE, thus it is hardly to say this is the advantage of TGC. This comment can also be applied to Figure 3. The running time should also compare with other temporal baselines.\n4)\tIn Figure 4, it is not clear what is TGN + TGC? Since TGC is based on HTNE, I guess what you mean is applying clustering assignment distribution and adjacency matrix reconstruction to TGN. If so, please give the ablation studies on each component.\n\nThere are lots of typos in the paper.
