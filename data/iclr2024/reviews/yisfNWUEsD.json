                "value": "This paper introduces the SCALE framework, which integrates specialized Translation Models (STM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, utilizing triplet examples for few-shot learning. Each triplet incorporates an additional element: a translation generated by the STM, supplementing the standard source and target sentences. The study demonstrates significant enhancements in translating from various low-resource languages into English (X\u2192En). Furthermore, the paper conducts ablation studies to show the individual contributions of each SCALE component to the overall performance improvement."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Major weaknesses:\n- I like the idea; however, the paper focuses on translation into English and does not demonstrate the efficacy of translating from English to these low-resource languages. I suspect that SCALE has limitations in translating from English, given that refinement is core to SCALE. Although GPT-4 excels in English, it falls short in low-resource languages, suggesting that SCALE may not be effective for En\u2192X.\n- SCALE seems confined to low-resource languages, as LLM already performs excellently in translating between high-resource languages, such as German and French. The paper should make it clearer for readers how SCALE fares in the context of translating high-resource languages.\n- In presenting \"pivoting\" (Sec. 4.2) and \"updating\" (Sec. 4.3), the paper restricts its experiments to LAO\u2192En and Xhosa\u2192En, respectively, which doesn't sufficiently substantiate this aspect. Conducting more comprehensive experiments would provide stronger support for the concept.\n\nMinor weaknesses:\n- The paper's assertion that SCALE \"mitigates both language bias and parallel data bias\" seems peculiar to me. It feels intuitive rather than conclusively factual. Defining \"language bias\" and \"parallel data bias,\" followed by a quantitative analysis, might be necessary for clarity.\n- The choice of a less advanced model like GPT-2 for evaluating GPT-4's fluency strikes me as odd. While employing GPT-2 might yield reasonable comparative results for less sophisticated generation models, but I do not think it is proper here."

It is highly likely that the original results are more preferred by GPT4 than the refined results.\n\nIt is not straightforward to me why the STM results are with higher NM score than GPT4, but based on these results, SCALE achieves results with lower NM than GPT4.\n\nIt is not even clear for me whether the NM or USW should be higher or lower. According to the analysis, GPT4 produces results that are more literal (which is bad ), while STM have results more figurative. But it seems to me that GPT4 understand source languages better than STM, which is more likely to generate figurative translations.\n\nBesides, since the LLMs learn how to use the latent variable Z by the examples, it might be extremely important to choose proper demonstrations. It will be useful to check the effects of different demonstrations."
