While the experimental results from [1] clearly  show that implication\n    constraints help with verification times,  the paper says \"they were\n    handled as constraints to a black-box MIP solver without validating their\n    usefulness\". \n\n    b. Bound implication graphs were previously constructed in [2], where they\n    were precisely used to reduce the total number of branches. The paper\n    however presents the implication graph as a novel aspect of the paper and\n    does not reference [2].\n\n    c. While the procedures computing the implication constraints in [1] are\n    GPU-friendly the paper claims the opposite. Although they were used as MILP\n    constraints in [1] and as a branching heuristic in [2], their\n    identification relies only on matrix operations.  [2] discusses that they\n    can be incorporated into any verifier with  a branching mechanism.\n\n    d. The paper does not clarify with the introduction of the implication\n    constraints that they were first introduced in [1].\n\n3. The main novelty of the paper is the computation of the implication\nconstraints using bound equations (which are computed using previously\nestablished methods) instead of the concrete bounds. The delta is small in my\nopinion for an ICLR paper.\n\n4. The implication constraint identification procedures are not compared with\nthe ones from [1]. It is not clear that they perform better. For instance [1,\n2] show similar gains. Also, the procedures from [1] should be faster because\nthey deal with concrete bounds instead of bound equations.\n\n[1] E. Botoeva, et al.

They find these implications by evaluating the linear bounds on the implicated neuron, as computed during LiRPA, over the part of the specification compatible with a linear relaxation of the split of the implicating neuron. Enforcing these implied splits during BaB, improves verification performance on a wide range of tasks."

E.g. adding the scores of implicated neurons to the implicating one.\n2) Did you investigate the interaction of these bound implications with the general cutting planes from GCP (also based on beta-CROWN)? It seems like similar implications might be captured by the MILP solver used there.\n3) Did you investigate the effect of how many implicating neurons $K$ you consider?\n4) In Theorem 3.2, it seems like the two enumerated points add an additional (exhaustive) case distinction if Equation (7) holds, where the first one can be checked independently of the implicated neuron. I would consider moving them to a separate Corollary. What exactly does it mean for its \u201clinear bounds to not have an intersection with C\u201d? Is the first constraint (functionally) equivalent to $a x_0 + c + \\epsilon ||a|| < 0 $, i.e. the lower bound will remain negative for any $x \\in \\mathcal{C}$? I believe the presentation of Theorem 3.2 could be improved significantly. In particular, it is not initially clear, that either of the two cases follows from Equation (7) rather than being additional constraints.\n\n### Comments\n* The scaling of the y-axis in Figure 2 is unclear making it hard to interpret. I would consider a linear scale instead.\n* I believe it should be \"(inputs $\\leq$ 0)\" for the \"inactive\" case in Section 1 paragraph 3.\n* An illustration of Theorem 3.2 could help communicate the underlying intuition.\n\n#### Typos\n- Mn-BaB instead of MN-BaB in Section 1 paragraph 2\n- Extra \u201cthe\u201d in the third line of Section 2\n- The second sentence after Equation (3) is broken and missing a full-stop.\n- \u201cActivate and inactive\u201d third last line in Section 2\n\n### Conclusion\nThe proposed idea of using a (sub)BIG to reduce the number of to be considered branches in BaB-based neural network verification is novel and seems effective. Further, the novel VeriHard benchmark might prove valuable for evaluating novel certification methods beyond this work. However, the lacking comparison to the important baseline GCP makes both its complementarity with and performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods unclear, preventing me from recommending (strong) acceptance"
