                "value": "1. The paper focuses on time series data but there is no statistical analysis focusing on time series data.

(2022; 2018) for a proof of the $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency for estimates as $\\theta^0$ and $\\theta^i$.\"  I do not think the cited references deal with time series data directly. It is disappointing that the paper does not provide any extensive treatment of time series analysis. \n\n2. Lemma A.1 claims that conditional mean independence in part 1 is equivalent to the conditional dependence in part 2. This seems mainly driven by Axiom (A) where the error $\\varepsilon$ is exogenous independent noise. I feel that this is a rather restricted setting. For example, suppose that Y is the time series of financial returns (e.g., S&P 500) and X is the causal factor that does not affect the conditional mean of returns but does affect the conditional variance of returns (typically called volatility in finance). It seems that the framework in the current paper excludes this kind of scenario. It is unclear to me what sense Axiom (A) is necessary; related to this point, Appendix A.3 is difficult to understand (see question 1 below)."

Some further comments would be useful.\n\n2. The derivation on page 18 after \"We now prove the claim\" is difficult to follow. It seems to me that it is already assumed that $E[Y_ T | X_t^i = x, I_T^{\\backslash i} = i] = E[Y_T | X_t^i =x', I_T^{\\backslash i} = i]$ for any $x$ and $x'$ in the derivation; but I am not sure why. Does the current proof imply the if and only if result for equation (3)? Some clarifications would be helpful. \n\n3. I cannot follow why equation (4) is a good property. This indicates that the bias multiplied by $\\sqrt{n}$ goes to zero. It might be better to show that the root mean squared error multiplied by $\\sqrt{n}$ goes to zero as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. Some explanations would be helpful.\n\n4. In the experiments on page 8, the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) is used as the performance metric. It would be beneficial why this metric is related to causality concerns."

Thus, I do not consider the relaxation of this assumption as an advantage of the method, as it falls outside the scope of the algorithm. Please correct me if I missed the point.\n2. In the first equation on page 4, what is $N$?\n3. In equation 3, what is $n$? Should it be $k$?\n4. I felt lost that in equation 3, $g^0_0$ and $g^i_0$ equal to the same conditional expectation as $\\alpha^0_0$ and $\\alpha_0^i$ in the second point in section 5.1. Are they the same things?\n5. As the appendix states, $k$ ranges from 3 to 7. What is the value of $k$ used in each experiment? Is the algorithm output sensitive to the value of $k$?\n6. The term \"trajectories\" means the time series, correct? In Fig.2, what does $N_feat$ represent? Is $N_feat$ indicative of the number of trajectories? Additionally, in Fig.3, all the algorithms exhibit improved performance with an increase in the number of trajectories. Could you provide a brief explanation for this trend? Moreover, why does Fig.3 depict the performance in low-sample regimes, and how are \"low-sample regimes\" reflected in the Fig.3?\n7.

                "value": "This paper presents a novel and efficient Doubly Robust Structure Identification from Temporal Data (SITD) algorithm, offering theoretical guarantees including $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency. It establishes a technical connection between Granger causality and Pearl's time series framework, outlining the conditions under which the approach is suitable for feature selection and full causal discovery. The paper's theoretical insights highlight the algorithm's ability to handle non-linear cyclic structures and hidden confounders, even without relying on faithfulness or causal sufficiency. In extensive experiments, the approach demonstrates remarkable robustness, speed, and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it a valuable contribution to causal discovery in various applications."

                "value": "- They've introduced a doubly robust structure identification method for analyzing temporal data. It doesn't rely on strict faithfulness and causal sufficiency assumptions, making it versatile enough to handle general non-linear cyclic structures and hidden confounders.\n\n- The innovative application of the double machine learning framework to Granger causality is a significant contribution.\n\n- The paper is well-structured, maintaining a coherent and easily-followed flow from beginning to end.\n\n- The paper extensively references related work, offering a comprehensive overview of prior research that not only provides valuable context for the study but also underscores the authors' profound understanding of the field."

Have you formally demonstrated this claim in any specific section, or are you implying that the proof of Theorem 4.1 does not rely on this assumption?"
