                "value": "Although I enjoy reading this paper and appreciate the explicit discussion on the limitations, I have some major concerns about ParFam.\n\n**1. Is It still Symbolic Regression?**\n\nTo my understanding, symbolic regression is a learning-based approach to find the mathematical expression of a function from the observed data, which includes two important components:\n\n- Learn the analytical function structure;\n\n- Optimize the coefficients (parameters) of the structure;\n\nThe former is unique for symbolic regression, which distinguishes it from the other regression problems. Symbolic regression is difficult and is currently shown to be HP-hard with formal proof [1]. I think this is the reason why an efficient (approximate) SR algorithm will be \"usually quite complicated\" as described in this work.   \n\nIn ParFam, however, the analytical structure learning step is totally bypassed with a predefined function structure. The original problem is hence reduced to sparse regression with a fixed structure, and the only goal is to find the optimal coefficients. Is it still symbolic regression?  \n\n**2. Strong Prior Knowledge on Physics are Required**\n\nTo achieve promising performance on SR problems for physics formulas, ParFam requires prior knowledge of all possible physics formulas, as from SRBench and the Cambridge Handbook of Physics Formulation. I think this prior knowledge is very strong and only specific to physics formulas, and is hard to be generalized for other SR problems in real-world applications.  \n\n**3. DL-ParFam**\n\nThe idea of DL-ParFam, a deep learning-based pretrain model for ParFam, is interesting. But it is currently more like a toy prototype, and only tested on very simple synthetic problems. To truly show the advantage of DL-ParFam over other pre-training-based SR methods, a concrete model design on real-world SR applications is required. \n\nIn DL-ParFam, the model only takes the function value y as input to predict the mask c for all parameters, and all information of the function input x is completely ignored. It is hard to believe this approach can provide a reasonably good prediction for real-world SR applications, especially those with complicated structures. \n\nTo build the pre-trained model, DL-ParFam requires the input data x to have the same dimension $m$, and the data should be sampled on the same grid across all different data sets. Can this requirement be easily satisfied for physical SR problems and other SR problems?\n\n**4. Experiments**\n\nSince ParFam has a strong prior knowledge of the physical formulas, it is expected it can have promising performance on the physics SR problems. Indeed, according to the results, ParFam even discards part of the observed data, and only requires a subset of 500-1000 data points for coefficient optimization. It is hard to imagine this procedure could work well for real-world SR problems.\n\nDL-ParFam is only tested on very simple synthetic problems. It is hard to judge its potential for solving real-world application problems with complicated structures."
