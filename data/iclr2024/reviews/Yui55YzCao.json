                "value": "This paper studies spectral GNN. Starting from the widely adopted empirical observations that the homophilic level of the interested graph determines which frequencies are preferred in response, the authors present a rigorous theorem to characterize the dependency between the homophilic level and the preferred graph filter. Then, a theoretically motivated novel GNN is proposed, named NewtonNet. To instantiate the idea of encouraging larger amplitude for specific frequencies than the others, NewtonNet is weaponed with interpolation technique rather than approximation, which allows directly regularizing each specific frequency\u2019s response amplitude. The authors also conducted extensive experiments on various node classification tasks with different split ratios. NewtonNet seems to surpass existing methods in most cases. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the learned graph filter implies that NewtonNet\u2019s advantage is rooted in how it aligns with the theorem introduced in this paper, namely, learning low-pass and high-pass filters on homophilic and heterophilic graphs, respectively."

The importance is due to that a lot of research works have regarded it as a fact, yet such a rigorous analysis is absent. Generality is in the sense that it is not restricted to a specific random graph model, has no unrealistic assumption, and has helpful implications.\n3.\tThe proposed NewtonNet is novel to me. It is not another spectral GNN that just replaces the polynomial family to approximate the desired graph filter. Instead, NewtonNet considers an interpolation technique, which allows it to regularize specific frequencies explicitly. Moreover, no additional computation, especially spectral decomposition, is involved, which ensures NewtonNet is practical and scalable.\n4.\tThe experimental results are convincing, including new heterophilic datasets, and compare different methods at various split ratios."

This is not a technical flaw but needs to be further discussed.\n2.\tIn the experimental setup, GCN is regarded as a spatial GNN method, which is not that necessary, in my opinion. To my knowledge, GCN is often analyzed as a simplification of Chebyshev polynomial approximator."

Actually, this is a crucial factor for the explicit shape-aware regularization to work well, according to my understanding of this work.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nI tried your code. There are some questions that need to be answered so that I can reproduce your reported results:\n\n1. How do you set `weight_decay`? It seems that there are typos in D.4, where `dropout` and `dprate` are taken from $ \\{ 0, 0.0005 \\} $. However, I guess they are chosen from $\\{0, 0.5\\}$, and `weight_decay` is chosen from $\\{0, 0.0005\\}$. Am I wrong?\n2. I am curious about how you conduct HPO. The search space is supposed to be:\n\n```Python\n lr = trial.suggest_categorical(\"lr\", [0.005, 0.01, 0.05])\n temp_lr = trial.suggest_categorical(\"temp_lr\", [0.005, 0.01, 0.05])\n dropout = trial.suggest_categorical(\"dropout\", [0, 0.5])\n dprate = trial.suggest_categorical(\"dprate\", [0, 0.5])\n wd = trial.suggest_categorical(\"wd\", [0.0, 5e-4])\n gamma1 = trial.suggest_categorical(\"gamma1\", [0, 1, 3, 5])\n gamma2 = trial.suggest_categorical(\"gamma2\", [0, 1, 3, 5])\ngamma3 = trial.suggest_categorical(\"gamma3\", [0, 1, 3, 5])\n```\n\nIt seems that it is intractable to enumerate all possible choices. Instead, I run your code with an HPO toolkit (optuna) with 400 trials, where each trial returns the mean best valid accuracy as the feedback. Other hyper-parameters are kept unchanged (i.e., using your default value `K=5`, `L=2`, and `hidden=64`. The best trial on Cora, CiteSeer, Crocodile, and Gamer are 90.610, 78.797, 76.002, and 61.861, respectively. Obviously, it is not that promising to achieve the reported test accuracy for such configurations, and, as expected, the test accuracy on them are 87.948, 77.293, 74.037, and 61.712, respectively."

Could the authors offer additional insights into the hyperparameter tuning process? While the paper briefly mentions hyperparameter tuning, more extensive details on the selection process and an assessment of the sensitivity of results to hyperparameter choices would enhance clarity.\n4. What is the scalability of the proposed approach to larger graphs? The current evaluation primarily focuses on relatively small graphs. Understanding its performance and computational complexity as graph size scales would be beneficial, particularly for applications involving larger graphs.\n5. Can the authors provide a deeper understanding of the interpretability challenges associated with the proposed approach? The paper notes potential interpretability issues, but additional insights into the specific challenges and potential pathways to improve interpretability would be valuable.\n6. How does the proposed approach handle noisy or incomplete data? The paper does not explicitly address the approach's handling of noisy or incomplete data, which can be a limitation in real-world scenarios.
