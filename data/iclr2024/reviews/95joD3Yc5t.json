This seems to be conflicting with the motivation.\n- Pragmatic compression (preserving useful information in the bottleneck) [1] seems to be quite related. How would the authors compare with this line of work? \n- In terms of writing, I feel it would be nice to have more overarching sentences explaining the model design instead of going into too details in the experiment section. There also seems to be a lack of explanation on the baselines in experiment section. This is especially important on less established benchmarks and tasks.\n- There is no obvious modeling novelty on generative models or compression + diffusion algorithm.\n\nOverall the paper is working on an interesting direction. But the paper needs some more work on justifying the training choice of generative model, making writing more clear and experiment section more informative.\n\n[1] Pragmatic Image Compression for Human-in-the-Loop Decision-Making"
