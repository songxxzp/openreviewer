It looks like \"find a proof\" (from the only example given in Figure 1 and on page 4), where the sisterOf and motherOf are given as facts. Abduction in logic means to find a plausible explanation:\ne.g. why did someone cough? An explanation is that they have asthma. Another explanation is they have a cold. The system does not know wether they have asthma or a cold. It is difficult to judge the correctness of an answer.\n\n(see also questions)"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The overall pitch of the paper is not as convincing as it could be. It's written like the community believes (from prior papers) that LLMs have strong logical reasoning skills, and that the current paper questions this belief and provides evidence against it. However, I don't think it's the case that the community believes logical reasoning is solved by LLMs. E.g., for the datasets considered here, even the baseline performance (in the original, so-called *Semantics* version of the tasks) is not high enough. This makes the motivation of the study relatively weak.\n\nThe pitch is also confusing because of the use of the word \"paradox\". What paradox exactly is being explored here? Reading the title, I was expecting to see something like: LLMs are great at X, which implies they should be great at Y too, but they fail at Y, raising a conundrum. Or some such internal conflict or conflict with commonsense expectations, that would justify the word paradox. I'm not sure what the authors have in mind for a paradox.\n\nOverall, while I thought the study was useful, I didn't find anything subjectively surprising. It is generally accepted that LLMs --- being **language models** --- rely on many linguistic clues and prior knowledge to perform tasks. Taking away these clues is thus expected to drop performance. Similarly, training directly on the so-called *Symbolic* form should help, which they authors also find to be the case. All this is very much aligned with expectation, which makes it difficult to pin point what the new knowledge this paper would bring to the community.\n\nThere are number of additional side experiments in the paper. This, in principle, is nice. However, while reading through those section, I found the large number of questions to be somewhat distracting. At the least, the authors should try to thread the narrative better through these side experiments and analyses, and try to provide a view of them that helps support the overall message of the paper.\n\nIn summary, while it's somewhat useful to see the experiments on *Symbolic* forms of the considered datasets done, the results don't really feel different from what one might expect to see.\n\nMINOR comments:\n\n* The use of *Semantics* when referring to relation names but not when referring to logic is confusing. Logic, of course, by design has a very clear and unambiguous semantics. I think what you mean is *linguistic semantics* of predicate names. If so, please be sure to clarify this and emphasize the *linguistic* aspect.\n\n* Your related work section (as well as the introduction) has a **lot** of citations, almost too many to be meaningfully valuable. E.g., near the top of page 3, you have 12+ citations around ICL, without any explanation of the connection between these prior works and what's in your paper. As a general rule, it's more valuable for the related work section to point out the few most related works AND articulate a clear connection of the current work to them, as opposed to dumping a huge list of papers just to cover every possible connection.\n\n* The last sentence of page 2 (\"Wei et al propose symbolic tuning, which ....\") is very long and hard to parse."

What are the main take-aways from this table and how do they support your claims? E.g., it appears the going from the Semantics setting to the Symbolic setting does *not* reduce the performance of the models substantially; in fact, the performance goes up in many cases.

The authors first evaluate pre-trained models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo) on logical reasoning tasks (deduction, induction, abduction) on both problems expressed with symbols and with words. They observe a large gap in some of the tasks, with even GPT-4 performing generally very poorly on induction with symbols, but much better with words that carry commonsense semantics. The authors then try fine-tuning LLaMA 2 on these tasks, observing that while it is able to match the training rules very well, it still cannot generalize to novel logical rules at inference time."

                "value": "The paper has two main sets of results: with prompting and with fine-tuning. I'll give separate comments on those.\n\n## Results with prompting\n\nThe main result here was that models performed significantly worse when symbols were used to described the rules, instead of meaningful words. In a broad sense, this question has been studied before in both papers that observed content effects in LLM reasoning that the authors cite (PrOntoQA and Dasgupta et al). In those papers, they used made-up words, whereas here the authors used short symbols (A, B, etc), but I believe the insight is the same. So, if the authors believe this says something that hasn't been said before, I don't think it came across in the paper.\n\nFinally, the gap in these results is significantly larger in the induction and abduction tasks. The results of GPT-4 in induction (< 10% with symbols) do make me wonder whether this was due to the specific way the task was set up, or whether these are honest failures. It would be interesting if this was the latter case, since induction and abduction haven't really gotten as much attention from prior work. However, the paper has little detail about these tasks besides the general description (I have some specific questions below). It would have helped to have seen many examples of the problems and of GPT-4 responses, to make sure that the task was set up properly and that this is actually due to GPT-4 having a surprisingly bad performance. I tried to find such examples in the Appendix, but couldn't (it's possible I just missed them because there's a lot there! In that case, please point me to it).\n\n## Results with fine-tuning\n\nFor fine-tuning, the main result was that models can internalize rules seen during training, but fail to generalize to novel rules. But if I understand, the total number of rules in training and testing was extremely small (5 in training, 3 in testing). Indeed, we would not expect to see generalization from these many examples. There are many other works showing that you do need a certain minimal level of task diversity in the training to get in-context learning in LMs [1,2]. In order to draw this strong conclusion that Transformers might have fundamental limitations to generalizing to unseen logical rules, you would have to train with a much larger number of training rules (e.g. hundreds of thousands) to make this argument convincing. If _even then_ you see a large gap, then it starts to look more like scaling the data is not leading to significant improvements, suggesting that such limitation might be more fundamental. But, at the current scale, the negative result is to be expected, and does not lead to insights into the broader motivating question.\n\n[1] Pretraining task diversity and the emergence of non-Bayesian in-context learning for regression.

                "value": "- Can you point to specific examples of GPT-4 failures in induction and abduction?\n- Generally, your few-shot numbers seem worse than zero-shot. Why would that be the case? That might point to not giving good examples of reasoning.\n-- In particular, looking at some of the examples of the appendix, I don't think they contain valid reasoning. For example, this one in Appendix H:\n```\nStatement: r8(Elena, Nina)\nAnswer: We can use logical rule L5: \u2200A, B, C : r3(A, B) \u2227 r3(B, C) \u2227 r2(A) \u2192 r8(A, C) to deduce whether the statement r8(Elena, Nina) is true or false. [...]\n```\nThis is not the complete problem, but I don't think this is correct. Rule L5 might only be used to prove that r8(A, C) is true (which in this case it does), but if its premises are not satisfied it does not say anything about r8(A, C) being false. Thus, this example is misleading - this reasoning template does not generalize. In fact, all of the other examples below this one proceed like this, and conclude \"true\". Do you also give examples of \"false\" cases?\n- Why are there missing entries in induction in Table 1?\n- What do you think are the novel insights in your experiments with words <--> symbols compared to results in prior works around content effects in LLM reasoning?\n- For induction and abduction, what was the complexity of the held-out premises or rules? How did you make sure the answer was unique, since this is logically non-trivial? (in fact impossible, since formally there will be an infinite set of hypothesis in first-order logic that could be used to derive any given conclusion)\n- For fine-tuning, would you be able to provide specific fine-tuning examples, besides just the prompts?"

Previous works [e.g. Saparov & He] already showed that semantics affects LLMs's reasoning ability, and that if we give new fact and rules contrary to the pretraining prior, the model struggles with learning those new rules. I think the main message of this paper is the same thing and not very new.\n2. While I agree that looking at test performance on multiple OOD datasets is important, I hope the authors can explain more clearly whether the datasets contain the same logic rules as the training dataset (LogicTree). If they're different, why do we expect finetuning on LogicTree would generalize at all? Requiring the model to generalize to any novel symbolic rule OOD doesn't seem reasonable to me. Usually for domain generalization one has to specify the boundary of domains. Is this all first-order logic or propositional logic? The delineation seems unclear to me, and I'm not sure inductive reasoning is comparable to deductive reasoning, since we would also not want the model to learn spurious correlations in context. I think the authors should clarify the exact scope of expected generalization in mathematical language. For example, we may want to train on 2-hop but generalize to multi-hop problems, etc.\n3. Some minor issues:\n(1) All tables and plots: missing error bars\n(2) Tables 4, 5, 6 can have more informative row names. The current row names are hard to parse.\n(3) Table 6 is lacking context.
