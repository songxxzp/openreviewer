The theory effectively connects with the experiment: the utilization of a weighted average operation has the potential to reduce noise effectively."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. It is necessary to provide a clear definition of \"implicit representation\" and \"explicit representation\" in the manuscript. Some reviewers may intuitively refer to the fixed-length vector representation of a data sample as \"implicit representation\" since it may not be human-friendly. However, in this manuscript, the fixed-length vector representation is referred to as the \"explicit representation.\"\n2. The proposed method (HDFE) relies on the assumption that the input data follows Lipschitz continuity. While the reviewer agrees that point cloud data intuitively follows Lipschitz continuity, it would be beneficial for the manuscript to include an analysis of the types of input data that adhere to Lipschitz continuity.\n\n3. As a module that doesn't require any training, it is important to provide detailed guidance on selecting hyperparameters. This includes guidance on choosing the size of the fixed-length vector representation (denoted as $N$) and determining the hyperparameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in Equation 5, which are influenced by the receptive field $\\epsilon_0$ and the Lipschitz continuous constant $c$.\n\n4. 2The selection of weights ($w_i$ in Equation 1), hyperparameters ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$), and the mapping functions $E_X$ and $E_Y$ are highly dependent on the dataset. This means that if the task or input data changes, all these variables need to be carefully decided and tested.\n\n5. There is a small concern regarding the experimental results on the PCPNet dataset. The proposed HDFE method is demonstrated to outperform the PCPNet model (the baseline in 2018) simply by replacing PointNet with HDFE. However, it is only comparable to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, outperforming it in four out of twelve metrics, albeit with a slight drop in average performance. It would be valuable to provide insights or explanations for these observations and discuss any potential limitations or implications of the results."

                "value": "1. In line 7 of page 2, why is the representation learned by PointNet (Qi et al., 2017a) not easily decodable? For instance, in their original paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00593.pdf) in Figure 2, it seems possible to set m=3 and obtain normalized point clouds. Additionally, other works like [1] may also be able to 'decode' the input from the vector representation. Is there any difference between this manuscript and those works?\n\n2. When experimenting with batches, should the model visit all data samples to decide hyperparameters? According to Equation 3, the decoding step should visit all $\\bm Y$.\n\n3. By curious: why a high-dimensional input does not affect the size of the fixed-length vector representation $N$. Could the author provide further explanation, possibly an extension of the paragraph on 'Scale to high-dimensional input'?\n\n4. in Section 2.3, the manuscript only shows the picking of $E_X$ and $E_Y$ when the function output y is scalar. Are there more cases that can be considered?\n\n5. Although HDFE is a deterministic function, is there any empirical result available to estimate the information loss from the raw input to the fixed-length vector representation?\n\n\n\n[1] Learning Representations and Generative Models for 3D Point Clouds.
