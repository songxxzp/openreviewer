                "value": "1. The paper does not explain why they use the gradient norm as the convergence measure and fails to mention a line of research studying that. In convex-concave minimax problems, the standard convergence measure is the duality gap $\\max_y f(\\bar x,y) - \\min_x f(x,\\bar y)$ or minty solution $F(x)^\\top (\\bar x - x)$ in the sense of variational inequality. This is natural since the optimal point of interest is the Nash equilibrium or the saddle point. There does exist a line of research studying monotone inclusion or gradient norm convergence in the same setting, e.g., Halpern iteration [arXiv:2002.08872, arXiv:2203.09436] or anchoring [arXiv:1905.10899, arXiv:2102.07922, arXiv:2106.02326], but the paper does not compare with them. Specifically, the algorithm in [arXiv:2203.09436] achieves $E\\Vert F z_k\\Vert^2 \\leq 1/k^2$ (see Theorem 4.1) with less assumptions (no Hessian Lipschitzness). The idea of combining extragradient with anchoring is also not new [arXiv:2102.07922].\n\n2. The paper keeps mentioning that GDA and stochastic extragradient do not converge for convex-concave minimax problems and claims that one important contribution is to fix the non-convergence problem. However, for convex-concave minimax problems, it is easy to show that the average iterate of (stochastic) GDA converges with the rate $1/k^{1/2}$ measured by the duality gap, without additional smoothness or Hessian Lipschitzness assumptions (even though the last-iterate does diverge). I am also confused by the statement that previous works (Mishchenko, 2020b & Diakonikolas, 2021) on stochastic extragradient only guarantee convergence to a neighborhood. To my best understanding, these works are able to show $E\\Vert F(x)\\Vert\\leq\\epsilon$ (Theorem 4.4 of Diakonikolas, 2021) or $E[F(x)^\\top (\\bar x - x)]\\leq\\epsilon$ (Theorem 3 of Mishchenko, 2020b). This paper can be misleading and overclaiming.\n\n3. The paper seems to claim that the bounded domain assumption is strong and thus studies the unconstrained setting. However, according to the well-known von Neumann's minimax theorem, when the objective is convex-concave, the convex and compact domain assumption is necessary to ensure the existence of the Nash equilibrium. When the domain is $R^d$, Assumption 2 is questionable, and it's not clear what solution the algorithm finds when $\\Vert Fz\\Vert\\to 0$.\n\n4. The assumption that Hessian is Lipschitz seems to be too strong and unusual for the considered setting. The algorithm studied in the paper is neither high-order nor has a last-iterate convergence guarantee (Theorem 5.4).\n\n5. The convergence of SEG-RR and SEG-FF is strictly worse than SGDA-RR in the strongly monotone setting. Could the authors explain why?\n\n6. Proposition 5.2 says the reason why anchoring is also required to match (13). Then what changes after anchoring is introduced? How does each term in (13) match? Its LHS is of order $\\eta_1\\eta_2/n^2$ while the RHS is of order $\\eta^2$. Does this mean $\\eta_1 = \\eta n$ also holds? Isn't $\\eta_2=2\\eta_1$ still true? Moreover, $z_0-\\eta n F(z_0 - \\eta n F(z_0))$ in Proposition 5.3 is just one step of EG from $z_0$. Does it suggest that $N$ steps of SEG-FFA are equivalent to one step of EG, up to a small error, where $N$ can be multiple of $n$? Is this specifically for $N=2n$?\n\n7. The paper should also include SGDA-US/RR with anchoring and SEG-US/RR with anchoring, at least in experiments, to show that both ingredients of the algorithms are necessary. What if anchoring is the key step that makes everything converge? I do not fully believe that FF is something that should be done in practice, given that its computation is twice as much as the standard method in every epoch.\n\n8. (Minor) Could the author comment on the dependence on the condition number when the operator is strongly monotone and compare it with existing works? It could be more clear if the author explicitly listed all the necessary assumptions required for each theorem. Are Assumptions 1(1'), 2, 3, and 4 necessary for every theorem? The paper should also clearly state that the benefit of shuffling-based methods over uniform sampling only holds when $K>1$, i.e., the multi-pass case."

                "value": "However, I believe this work has some misleading statements, and the presentation of specific parts is unclear. \n\nLet me provide some details below:\n\n1) There are a few inconsistencies in the paper.  In my opinion, some parts and claims are not totally clear based on prior works. \nFor example, the authors claim that there is an example that SEG-US and SEG-RR diverge. However, the example that they select is a simple bilinear problem for which we know now that the SEG-US converges to the solution with a proper selection of step-sizes (see Hsieh et al 2020).  In particular, the authors claim that SEG-US diverges in expectation for any positive step-size selection. This comes in contradiction with existing known theoretical results. Why is that the case? Can the authors provide a detailed comparison with prior work?\n\n2) In several parts of the paper, the authors claim that EG is a good approximation of PP. This was already disproved in Gorbunov et al. 2022b, where the authors emphasize a significant difference between EG and the Proximal Point method.\n\n3) The section 5 had the potential to be very informative. In the first paragraph of this section, the authors mentioned that the section is where the underlying cause for non-convergence of SEG-RR is investigated, and the motivation of sing anchoring is explained . However, the section is not clear, and several important parts are missing. The presentation of the \"SECOND-ORDER MATCHING\" part is not robust, which makes the understanding and importance of the results in section 5 unclear. For example, there is no proper definition of what second-order means in EG update rules, and the results are not positioned in the literature. \n\n4)  #### On theoretical statements: \nThe authors wrote the following in their work: \"$O(\\eta^3)$ for the approximation error turns out to be the key to the exact convergence to an optimum under the monotone setting\". This sentence, unfortunately, was not adequately explained in detail in the main paper. Why this statement is necessary?\n\n5)  #### On theory: \nStatement of the theorems do not include all necessary assumption. I imagine that Assumptions 3 and 4 need to hold for every theorem, but this is not precisely stated. \n\n6)  #### Important comment on Assumptions: \nThe authors claim that Assumptions 3 and 4 are reasonable. They pointed out that the work of Golowich et al., 2020 uses Assumption 3(ii) to argue that this is a reasonable assumption. However, assumption 3(ii) is never used in any other paper on analysis for SEG (a first-order method). For example (Gorbunov et al., 2022b) remove assumption 3(ii) and still have nice convergence guarantees for SEG-US. In addition, Assumption 4 is also not reasonable to have. Of course, assumption 4 is more relaxed than bounded variance, but as explained in Gorbunov et al., 2022a this is not a necessary condition to show convergence. SEG-US does not require any bound on the stochastic gradient to guarantee convergence  (see Gorbunov et al., 2022a ),\n\n7) #### On Experiments: \nI believe algorithms in the experiments are compared with wrong step-size selection, which led to unfair comparison. That is, even if in Appendix A, all pseudocodes use $\\alpha_t$ and $\\beta_t$ to denote the extrapolation and update steps, respectively.\n in the experiments, $\\eta_k=\\alpha_k=\\beta_k$ is used for all methods. However, for the bilinear example, it is known that using the same step-size leads to no convergence of SEG-US. See (Hsieh, et al., 2020)\n\n8) Finally, the paper needs further experiments for completeness. For example, what is the practical benefit of the proposed method compared to other RR algorithms for solving strongly monotone problems?\n\n----\nHaving shared the above concerns in statements and presentations, analyzing SEG with random reshuffling is exciting and relevant for the ML community. I will happily increase my score if answers are given to my above criticism. That is, can the authors relax the existing assumptions and heavily improve the presentation of this work?"
