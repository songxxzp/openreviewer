                "value": "This paper considers the problem of estimating the population counts in a multivariate hypergeometric distribution.  The authors first propose using a continuous function that agrees with the likelihood function of the hypergeometric distribution on integer values, and then they maximize this surrogate function.  They show that this approach works if one has access to several independent samples (which would correspond to drawing a sample without replacement, then replacing all of those draws, and then sampling without replacement again, and so on).  The authors then turn to a more general case where different observations are each a set of samples drawn without replacement, and each observation comes from a different population (so that each observation is a hypergeometric distributed random variable with a different distribution).  They propose using a variational autoencoder in this case to perform inference, and apply this approach to single cell RNA sequencing data."

This is conceptually quite clean, and a nice extension of the normal model to take the weak dependency between observations into account.  I think this problem is well-appreciated in the field (e.g., treating data compositionally induces similar effects), but as far as I know this is a new approach to the problem. This point is made particularly well in Figure 6."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* I have some concerns about the motivation/applicability of the paper. In the first part, the authors contrast their approach to capture-recapture, and say that capture re-capture is not good because one must be able to sample (to tag) and then resample from the same population.  Yet, in their own setup (e.g., Equation (3)) the authors assume that one can repeatedly and independently sample from the same population.  I find this setup interesting from a statistics perspective, but unrealistic as an experimental design.  If I understand correctly, it would correspond to sampling without replacement from a population, returning all of those samples to the population, and then resampling without replacement and so on.  In some sense, this is essentially what the authors claimed was problematic about capture-recapture, but they are repeating it $T$ times instead of twice.  I would be happy to change my mind about this being problematic if the authors could provide some compelling, real life examples of datasets of practical interest with this experimental design.\n* At the bottom of Figure 3 it is claimed that Equation (4) is concave.  I plotted Equation (4) for a particular setup and it is _not_ concave.  One can also see this from Figure 1 where if one were to draw a well place diagonal line through the plot, one could obtain a linear slice where the negative log-likelihood first decreases, then increases, then decreases again, which is impossible for a convex function.  The error in reasoning comes from the fact that Equation (4) is the sum of both $\\log \\Gamma(x)$ and $-\\log \\Gamma(x)$ functions.  The former is strictly concave, but the latter is strictly convex.  The sum of convex and concave functions does not need to be either convex or concave.\n* Figures 2 and 3 should contain error bars and/or multiple replicates.  The fact that the error fluctuates across the number of trials (as opposed to monotonically decreasing) suggests that there is some substantial noise.  This noise makes it very difficult to assess the claim that increasing $K$ makes the problem easier.\n* My intuition is that the good performance in Figures 2 and 3 comes from the large number of trials.  E.g., even at thousands of trials, there is still substantial error.  In particular, if one only has a single trial, then I think that the MLE for the population counts should just be the observed counts, but the magnitude of this is driven entirely by the sample size and has nothing to do with the population size.  As a result, I don't think this is a sensible approach when there is only a single trial.  I suspect that this becomes problematic in the VAE setting -- since the likelihood is not particularly informative for any given point the prior will be incredibly important.\n\n\nMinor points / typos:\n* In Equation (1), I believe that $n_2$ should be $c_2$\n* The notation in Equation (8) is a bit sloppy.  I understand the point the authors are making, but it seems sloppy to define $\\hat{N}_i$ as a function of itself (i.e., $\\hat{N}_i$ appears on both sides of the definition).\n* \"to elongated along the line of correct\" --> \"as a line along the correct\""

                "value": "* I believe that the continuous version of the likelihood (i.e., Equation (4) but using equation (6) for the binomial coefficients) does not define a proper probability distribution for non-integer $N_k$.  Is this problematic?\n* Is there a reason for including the violation penalty $C_\\text{viol}$ as opposed t just performing bounded optimization?  The lower bound on $\\hat{N}_i$ can be determined easily from the data, so it would not be difficult to enforce the bound durning optimization.  Furthermore, the constraint set is quite simple (and convex), so something like projected gradient descent would be easy to perform."

After a brief review of related methods for estimation in simpler scenarios, or when resampling is possible (i.e., capture-recapture), the main method is presented. The key idea is to use a relaxation of a standard hypergeometric likelihood function (by replacing factorials with the Gamma function) with appropriate constraints to ensure that the estimated total population sizes are not greater than the sampled counts. Some experiments on synthetic data are done to check the proposed estimation procedure as it depends on the maximum samples drawn and the number of underlying categories. Then, a larger scale experiment with a VAE, using synthetic and real-data from single cell genomics, is presented. It is shown that the proposed method works well in recovering the underlying counts when the ground truth is known (in both synthetic and real-data scenarios)."
