If one latent feature (non-ordinal content) does not contribute much to an ordinal regression downstream task, then how much help could its augmentation provide? I would like to see some analysis about it.\n\n2. The authors use an example in Figure 1 to show that \"the commonly used strong augmentations can distort or even erase these essential features in ordinal regression data.\" Can you try some strong augmentation methods to demonstrate this claim in Tables 1, 2, and 3?\n\n3. What about the performance of OCP-CL when the mask sparsity ($\\lambda_1$) changes?\n\n4. For results in Tables 1-4 and Figure 6, are they average of multiple runs? What about the standard deviations?\n\n**Minors:**\n\n5. The proposed OCP-CL is somehow similar to feature selection for content disentangling. Can feature selection methods be applied to learn ordinal and non-ordinal content?\n\n6. How did you get the numbers in Table 5? By setting a threshold for $M$?"
