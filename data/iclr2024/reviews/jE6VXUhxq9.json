Some questions and remarks:\n\n- The reference to Figure 1 in the introduction does not help in understanding the faithfulness violation with deterministic relationships. It would be clearer, for instance, to give the example of a chain X -> Y -> Z, where Y = f(X), which violates faithfulness due to the conditional independence X _||_ Y | f(X).\n- The difference between Assumptions 2 and 3 could be clarified. Does Assumption 2 include the cases described in Assumption 3? \n- You mention PC requires \"faithfulness\" but based on your definitions, it seems to require \"non-deterministic faithfulness\". \n- Figure 1 illustrates a DC but does not clearly show why PC fails, since many factors could lead to the PC algorithm outputting graph b), even without deterministic relationships.\n- The SMR assumption could be introduced in more detail, since faithfulness is common but SMR is less so.\n- Theorem 4 seems overly specific. It could be more general by stating deterministic relationships will result in Var[Y | x] = 0, for any regression model. Is there a reason for using kernel regression specifically?\n- In the experiments, you limit non-linear relationships to a few function classes. You could make them more arbitrary by modeling f as a neural network with random weights, to represent a random non-linear relationship.\n- The examples illustrations always have edges, but your approach identifies the MEC, which has undirected parts. This distinction could be clarified. \n- Does SHD refer to the whole graph or just the BS? If the latter, why not consider the whole graph?\n- I like the discussion, which fairly points out some weaknesses."

Can the authors show some experimental results on cases when there are no deterministic relations to see if the proposed algorithm is at least as good as GES?\n* In Theorem 5, the authors show that BS and NDC are identifiable up to Markov equivalence class, but it is not clear to me what the characterization of Markov equivalence class is in the context of having deterministic relations in the graph as a whole. From Lemma 1, we know that there are CI statements that cannot be read-off from the graph, shouldn't there be a different characterization of Markov equivalence class?\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Lam, W.
