Furthermore, as far as I see from the proof of Theorem 1, one can get convergence rates of $\\|d_t\\|^2$ if only $q=|\\mathcal{A}|$, even if $q$ is very small.

But why $\\frac{1}{2\\delta} \\|\\nabla f_s(x_t) - u_t^s\\|^2$ is not weighted with $\\lambda_t^s$?\n2. Why does it hold that $\\|\\nabla f_s(x_t) - u_t^s\\|^2 = \\sum_{...} \\|x_{i+1} - x_i\\|^2 + \\| \\nabla f_s(x_{(n_t\u22121)q}) \u2212 u^s_{(n_t\u22121)q}\\|^2  $ in Eq.(23)\n3. In the Definition 3, why should $\\mathbb{E}  [\\sum_{s} \\lambda_i^s (f_s(x_t) - f_s(x_*))]$  be non-positive? This is not pointed out and proved in this paper. If this value is not non-positive, it is less than $\\epsilon$ is not meaningful. Furthermore, what is the meaning of $i$ in the notation $\\lambda_i^s$.\n4. In the Line-7, it should be ``gradient'' other than ``graident''.\n5. This paper consider the case that $f_s(x)$ are of the finite sum form. However, detailed description of finite sum form is lacked."
