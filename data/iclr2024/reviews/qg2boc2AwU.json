                "value": "The paper proposes EBMDock, an energy-based learning framework for rigid protein-protein docking. It models the docking problem as optimizing the pose that minimizes the energy function.  The energy function is a statistical potential based on the distance likelihood between residue pairs on the binding interface. It is modeled using Gaussian mixture models parameterized by a geometric deep neural network. EBMDock is trained with contrastive divergence using Langevin dynamics for negative sampling. This allows implicit data augmentation to handle limited protein complex data."

This raises questions about the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to existing techniques.\n\n- The use of only 100 samples for the DIPS-Het test set is questionable. It is unclear if there are any constraints that prevent the application of the proposed method to larger datasets. The authors should provide more information on this aspect and, if possible, test their method on a more extensive dataset.\n\n- The omission of xTrimoDock [1] from the baselines is a notable oversight. According to [1], xTrimoDock can outperform both HDock and AlphaFold-Multimer, and it is also relatively fast. The authors should consider including xTrimoDock in their comparison to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their proposed method.\n\n- While the performance of EBMDock-interface is impressive, it relies on the ground-truth binding interface, which might not be a fair comparison to other baselines. This could lead to misunderstandings regarding the method's actual performance. I suggest that the authors clarify this point and consider presenting the results of EBMDock-interface separately in a standalone table to avoid potential confusion.\n\n[1] xTrimoDock: Rigid Protein Docking via Cross-Modal Representation Learning and Spectral Algorithm"

Could more complex energy formulations further improve accuracy?\n- For the MDN, why choose a 6-component GMM?
