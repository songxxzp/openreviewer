                "value": "Current parameter-efficient finetuning methods still suffer from severe efficiency problems even though the number of trainable parameters has been significantly reduced compared to the total number of model parameters. This work owes this problem to the realm that the backward process still needs to be conducted from the last layer to the very front layer, therefore, the computation cost of the backward process remains high with the decrease of trainable parameters. To this end, this work proposes a finetuning method called LIFT to solve the problem. LIFT trains one chosen layer in every training phase, thus, guaranteeing the number of trainable parameters is constrained. This work also tries to mitigate the efficiency problem in the backward process by stopping the backward computation in layers aforehand the chosen layer."

The role and impact of training each layer in the training process are not thoroughly analyzed; only superficial observations are presented in the article. Additionally, it is questionable whether directly changing one layer of the original model will result in a loss of learning ability since changing the original network may cause greater damage to the original model abilities than other additive methods such as LoRA. Without assessing these issues, it is difficult to justify the actual effectiveness of the approach."

However, if a subset of layers or parameters is responsible for certain model-learned abilities, such as few-shot learning, changing these parameters during LIFT may bring severe forgetting problems in these abilities. Please help further elaborate on the advantages of iteratively training all model layers and the potential impact of LIFT on the forgetting problem. In addition, the three scheduling schemes explained in the paper may not be able to fully cover the selection of learning sequences, and the impact of different learning sequences of the model layer on learning efficiency and final performance is not clearly analyzed. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide a more specific analysis of this issue."

To address this inefficiency, a new method called LIFT (Layer-wIse Fine-Tuning) has been proposed. LIFT optimizes one layer at a time, reducing both the number of trainable parameters and the computational cost of backpropagation, leading to improved fine-tuning throughput (2.1x to 2.7x) without sacrificing model quality. When combined with existing methods like LoRA, LIFT enhances both compute- and parameter-efficiency, demonstrating up to 3.7x memory savings and up to 2.7x increased throughput. This method holds particular promise for accelerating the fine-tuning process in larger models and with bigger batch sizes, thus making advanced language models more accessible for diverse applications."

                "value": "The main critique of the proposed LIFT method is the potential for excessive memory usage when applied to multiple downstream tasks, as it necessitates storing separate sets of weights for each task. This could become impractical for practitioners managing numerous tasks, considering the current preference for approaches like LoRA, which require minimal additional storage per task while leveraging a shared, frozen pre-trained model base. LoRA's design also supports batch processing for its minimal weights across tasks.\n\nWhile the authors have mentioned the possibility of integrating LoRA with their LIFT method, the manuscript lacks detailed exploration of this combination, particularly since the presented experiments focus mainly on LIFT without incorporating LoRA.\n\nTo address this concern, the authors are encouraged to provide a more in-depth discussion on handling multiple downstream tasks with the proposed method, possibly extending the authors' experimental framework to include scenarios where LIFT is used in conjunction with LoRA. Such an investigation would not only illustrate the practicality of LIFT in common use cases but also strengthen the argument for its efficiency and versatility when combined with other parameter-efficient methods."
