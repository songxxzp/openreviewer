                "value": "This paper investigates an important yet often overlooked problem - the robustness of the reward model (RM). The authors propose a benchmarking technique called Contrast Instructions that gauges the reward consistency of an RM. The reward consistency is measured by consistency in preference ranking if given a pair of lexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. Concretely, it is quantified by (1) response consistency, if the RM can identify the better response for a given instruction, and (2) instruction consistency, if the RM can identify the most fitting instruction for a given response. The benchmark dataset is constructed based on four open-source human preference datasets of various NLP tasks. The authors showcased that an RLHF model trained with a more reward-consistent RM outperforms an RLHF model trained with the original RM in human evaluations."

The trickle-down effect of reward consistency on RLHF training is an interesting observation, which intuitively makes sense.\n4. Table 7 is helpful in seeing that reward consistency and test set accuracy (if I understood correctly) do not necessarily correlate. This is similar in the sense that the (dis-)correlation between human score and FID is often discussed in generative models."

                "value": "1. The way that the authors constructed the dataset, is filtering by the cosine similarity between SimCSE embeddings that are in the range of [0.75, 0.9]. This seems convenient but I wonder how reliable is this method. Have you done a manual inspection to measure the agreement rate between the method and human evaluators? Or maybe you could try using a model-based approach like prompting GPT-4?\n2. As I am more interested in the benchmark dataset itself, the evaluation for dataset validation seems limited. **The author should focus on providing a reliable benchmark as the major scientific contribution**; I believe the finetuning methods discussed in the manuscript are not as significant. Therefore, the authors should provide more evaluation results on more LLMs (open-source + closed-source) to validate your benchmark dataset. The evaluation results on popular models like GPT-4 would be very helpful. Although you can't get the weights, test by prompting would be sufficient. I am also curious to know the difference in consistency between the pre-trained model vs their SFT-ed version (i.e. llama2-7b vs llama2-7b-chat). If the compute resource allows, the parameter scaling on reward consistency could also be an interesting point for investigation.\n3. The benchmark dataset should be submitted along with the paper, as I believe this is the core contribution of the paper.\n4. The data variances in Figure 3 make the comparison in Sec. 7.2 rather inconclusive. However, I praised the authors' honesty in showing error bars."

What implications would arise if instances from the benchmark dataset were also present in LlaMa-7B's pre-training data or the dataset used to train the reward model? Have such overlaps impacted the assessment of reward consistency?\n2. I need more details on Section 4. For \"Single-Task\", what is the split between train and test?\n3. For Section 4, why would you fine-tune a benchmark dataset? And the fact that it performs so poorly after being trained and tested on the same dataset distribution is surprising. The consistency improvement seems marginal.\n4. What is RMEval in Table 7? Test set accuracy on binary classification task?\n\nOverall I am positive about this paper. This is an interesting piece of research. If the authors can properly address mines and other reviewer's concerns, I will agree to raise my review score."

                "value": "1. The paper claims the issue in reward inconsistency is due to the reward over-optimization issue (citing Gao et, al). Still, the reason for such reward over-optimization and how that causes the inconsistencies in the particular Contrast Dataset is unclear.  More specifically the author claims that \"From the RMs\u2019 perspective, correctly distinguishing between a clearly good vs. bad response is easy\". But the contrast dataset for example shown in Figure 1, they are very different questions although textually there are common words. Does that mean the current LLMs are not able to produce representations that can separate the two is not very clear and needs further clarification. For ex: \"A is a  good student\" and \"A is a bad student\", they have a lot of words in common but in representation space they should be extremely different and should be trivially separated if the representations are reasonable. Thus it's not very clear how Contrast Dataset is providing a challenging dataset to test RM model inconsistency.\n\n2. Another point is that why such reward inconsistencies are not observed in standard available RLHF datasets like Carper AI, hh, etc. are not made explicit. Does it mean that the majority of the datasets are easily separable and lacks samples towards the optima which is hard for human to segregate? A comparison with current RLHF methods is critical on standard datasets to understand the significance and mitigation of the problem properly.\n\n3. \"Surprisingly, we observe close to random-chance performance ..while humans are able to rank the responses correctly in \u2248 80% of the cases\" So, is it the case that humans are able to identify it but the reward models are not able to learn the same and failing is not very clear since its a supervised learning problem and can be shown to be strongly convex under certain settings. Hence, a clear description is missing on the same, and will be interesting to have a discussion with reference to the recent works showing convergence [1,2] and where this issue can arise in that context.\n\n[1].

The authors say they restricted this based on a particular cosine distance range, but some more rigorous evaluation around this could have made the impact of the dataset a bit stronger. For instance, one can query a bigger open LLMs in order to validate that the contrast instructions are fit for purpose. The other option could have been to conduct human eval on a randomly selected subset of the contrast instructions dataset. \n\n*  The authors could have just chosen one single baseline LLAMA 7B and use that to validate their claims. The behaviour of LLAMA 7B could be ground in the kinds of datasets and training procedures that it was subject to. Having few other RM baselines trained with similar RM training loss could have made the claims even more stronger.\n\n *  The human evaluation was done on 100 randomly selected data points and no standard errors and variance numbers were reported around the results. Since some of the results are close to each other, having the error bands around the result should help clarify the significance of improvements.\n\nOne other concern about human evaluation that I have is about the possibilities of potential bias as the authors themselves serve as human annotators for human eval of the results. There are several important statements made in this paper based on human evaluation. I would have preferred at least a mixture of external annotators (who are not aware of the work or how the responses were generated) to de-bias the evaluations. \n\"Finally, we report human performance resulting from the majority vote of three human annotators (the authors) on 100 randomly selected data points.\""

Have other methods been evaluated and ablated against before choosing these methods ? I wanted to understand if we are doing the best we can in terms of construction of these datasets and methods.\n\n2. I know you have considered the classic RM loss, log (sigmoid (R_chosen - R_rejected)) ? Have you considered other loss functions such as the margin loss used in LLAMA 2 ? I am not specifically looking for one kind of loss, but just a choice of few other RM losses. Considering different losses can help us understand whether RM inconsistency arises from the dataset or the kind of losses used or a combination of both. This would be a good ablation to understand where RM developers should focus more of their efforts on.\n\n3. Lot of times, RM training can easily lead to overfitting to the training datasets and creating a generalization gap in the process. Can you kindly explain how you do model selection for RM training for the baseline and your variants ?\n\n4. I know that you choose only a single example in ConvexDA while you construct a few semantically similar examples. Have you evaluated what happens if you include all of them ? I know this is unfair to be compared to the baseline, but it would help us understand having how many semantically similar examples will be useful.\n\n5.In table 2, I was not sure what (estimated) human performance means. Can you kindly clarify ?\n\n6. I know evaluating with larger models would be resource intensive.

It seems that it might work because it specifically targets the proposed benchmark, which mainly tests inconsistent instruction-response pairs with lexically similar words, but I'm not sure if the method can work well in scenarios where inconsistent responses/instructions are beyond just lexically similar words with different meanings. Moreover, I wonder if it would work equally well to simply use a different LLM to generate those similar pairs for augmentation.\n\n2. I'm also less clear about why REWARDFUSION is needed and how it contributes to fixing inconsistency. Again, it seems to mainly target the type of inconsistency due to lexically similar words with different meanings, which may not be general enough."

                "value": "The authors study reward models that are used for RLHF  to tune LLMs for desirable generations. Specifically the aspect of (in-)consistency is studied. The paper studies the following research questions:\n\n- How to measure in-consistency of reward models? : \n  - The authors introduce the Contrast Instructions benchmarking strategy to measure in-consistency.\n  - The benchmark consists of quadruplets consisting of lexically similar instructions but different responses. Two metrics are proposed: \n    - Response consistency: Can the RM assign a higher score to the correct response given the instruction \n    - Instruction consistency: Can the RM assign a higher score to the correct instruction given the response. \n  - The benchmarking is automatically constructed using existing open source human preference datasets. A sentence embedding model SimSE is used to find pairs of instructions that are lexically similar, but semantically different. \n  - This strategy has been explored with 4 popular open source human preference datasets. \n  - They find a huge performance gap on this benchmark between human judgements and reward models trained with the 7B LLaMa checkpoint\n- How to reduce the gap and improve consistency of reward models? : Two techniques ConvexDA and RewardFusion are introduced that can be incorporated into the training and inference stage of reward models at no additional computation cost. The authors show this helps improve consistency. \n  - ConvexDA: At training time, the data is augmented by substituting words in the responses with synonyms generated using WordNet \n  - RewardFusion:  At inference time, a weighted average reward score between similar training examples and given instruction response pair is used\n- How does reward inconsistency influence downstream performance of chatbots after RLHF? : The authors show that using a more consistent RM for RLHF can lead to more preferable downstream generations."

                "value": "- Contrast instructions benchmark: To sample lexically similar but semantically different pairs of instructions the authors only sample instruction pairs that lie within the similar range of 0.75 and 0.9. It would be useful to explain the sensitivity of this hyperparameter and study how well this prevents sampling semantically similar instructions. \n- When evaluating existing RM on this benchmark the reward models get a low C_res score of 53.6, even though C_res conceptually resembles the RM learning objective. This is surprising given the benchmark was constructed using the same datasets used for training. It would be useful to verify if appropriate hyper-parameter tuning was performed and if the model is able to overfit and get a high C_res score. \n- Limited models and scales: It would be useful to explore more pretrained models and perform a model and dataset scaling analysis to measure if and how the consistency of reward models varies across different models and scales and if similar observations are found. Would be useful to do a similar analysis when evaluating the impact of the proposed improvement methods ConvexDA and RewardFusion to see how well they perform with different models. \n- It would be useful to explain how the proposed data augmentation and inference time technique are designed to help with improving the performance in contrast instructions benchmark. This is especially important given the very small improvement on the Contrast Instructions benchmark with the proposed approaches. \n- The two methods ConvexDA and RewardFusion that are proposed are not used to build more consistent reward models that are used during the RLHF stage. Instead fine tuning on contrast instructions format is used. However, in appendix C, it is mentioned the \u201cmore consistent\u201d reward model is equipped with ConvexDA. \n  - It would be useful to evaluate models that have been trained (during RLHF) using reward models that are equipped with the proposed strategies (ConvexDA and RewardFusion) to show the improvements brought by this approach\n  - Please clarify what \u201cfinetuning with contrast instructions format\u201d consists of \n  - Please clarify if ConvexDA was used to train the reward models for this stage as mentioned in the appendix."
