Finally, the authenticity of the actions is checked using a forward dynamic model, and unreliable actions are discarded."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. My primary concern relates to the first contribution, \u201cOur findings indicate that high-return data, as opposed to noisy data with high diversity, benefits downstream offline policy learning performance more.\u201d I think the community implicitly understands that offline RL algorithms perform with high-quality \u201cexpert\u201d data, though few works explicitly state this claim. I think it\u2019s absolutely a point worth discussing, though I wouldn\u2019t consider it a core contribution. The claim itself is also difficult to assert, since prior and current works show that the story isn't so clear-cut. For instance:\n\n* Kumar et. al [1] discuss how offline RL algorithms benefit from noisy expert data.\n* Yarats et. al [2] show that vanilla off-policy RL algorithms can outperform state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms when given highly diverse data.\n* Corrado et. al [3] introduce a framework for generating expert-quality augmented data that outperforms random data augmentation frameworks. \n * Corrado et. al [4] show that increasing an agent's state-action diversity via augmentation often yields more improvement than increasing the amount of reward signal an agent receives via augmentation.\n* MoCoDA [5] is a data augmentation framework that enables users to directly control the distribution of augmented data generated. In particular, the user a can ensure task-relevant data is generated. This work also outperforms random data augmentation frameworks (including its predecessor CoDA [6])\n\nI suggest rephrase section 3 as more of a didactic example illustrating how high-value augmented data can be more useful than diverse data. I also suggest including some or all of these works in the paper's related work section -- particularly [3] and [5], since both of these works focus on generating high-value augmented data.\n\n1. My second concern is that the method seems to focus on generating high-value augmented data with low diversity (or low state-action coverage), but as mentioned above, data diversity is also quite important to the success of data augmentation. Thus, HIPODE may have limited applicability. I don't consider this a huge drawback though; in principle, one could use HIPODE to generate high-value augmented data along with an augmentation strategy that generates highly diverse (and potentially low-value) augmented data. It would be interesting to run experiments with \"Original + Return + Diversity X\" augmented data (using the naming convention of Table 1).\n\n1. I'm skeptical about using learned model to generate rewards. Offline RL requires access to a reward function, so why not simply label augmented transitions with their true reward? Generating augmented rewards seems like an unnecessary source of variability.\n\n1. Intuitively, I would expect HIPODE to offer the largest performance boost with random D4RL datasets (datasets which contain little to no high-value data), but its difficult to assess whether this intuition is true given the current presentation of results in Tables 2 and 3. I suggest grouping table rows by dataset type (random, medium, expert) and discussing general performance trends across dataset types.\n\n2. The paper should include significance test for results reported in Table 1 and Table 2. (e.g. paired-t test at a 95% confidence level). For instance, in Table 1, the \u201cOriginal + Return\u201d returns for \u201chalfcheetah-m-r\u201d look very similar to returns for the other datasets.\n\n1. Minor suggestion: the empirical section may flow a bit better if you first show HIPODE indeed generates high-value augmented data and *then* show that HIPODE improves performance.\n\nI currently lean to reject, but I do like the ideas presented in this work.\n   \n[1] Kumar et. al.

The core claim of section 3 is that high-quality data is better than random data, and this claim is supported by Table 1 (somewhat--see next point). Figure 2 seems to simply show that high-quality data has the highest reward (which is obvious, by definition). What\u2019s the purpose of t-sne here?\n\n1. HIPODE generates augmented data that remains close to the support of the offline dataset.

The use of the true environment for generating synthetic data is an idealized condition not typically accessible in practical Offline RL scenarios where learned dynamics models are employed. This idealization might overstate the effectiveness of high-return data augmentation as it does not account for inaccuracies that would be present when using a learned model for data generation. Moreover, the assertion that high-value states improve policy learning is somewhat tautological and may not be particularly insightful since it is well-understood that higher-quality datasets tend to yield better-performing policies.\n\n- Strength of Empirical Results: The empirical results presented, particularly in Section 5.2, lack sufficient detail and statistical rigor to substantiate strong claims of improvement. The absence of confidence intervals or a deeper statistical analysis in Table 3 makes it difficult to discern the significance of the performance gains attributed to HIPODE. Without this, the evidence provided does not firmly establish HIPODE\u2019s superiority over, e.g., the NoV method.\n\n- Benchmarking Against Recent Advances: The paper does not include comparisons to some of the more recent and potentially more effective model-based methods such as RAMBO and ROMI, which are known to deliver strong performances across various data regimes. This omission raises questions about the competitiveness of HIPODE and whether the improvements it offers are indeed leading-edge when considering the full landscape of contemporary Offline RL approaches.
