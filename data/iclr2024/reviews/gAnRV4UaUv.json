The main idea of adding adapters is technically sound and also aligns well with the problem setting as in nature well labeled cable images are not easy to acquire. This validates the choice of using adapters in this approach instead of a full fine-tuning. In this sense, the proposed approach is reasonably motivated.\n\nIn addition, adding text prompt to the model allows for more flexibility compared to a vision only model. This also improves the zero-shot generalization.  \n\nDespite its simpleness, the proposed approach already works well on some data and outperforms existing approaches."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Although the experiments have shown that the proposed approaches work well in many cases, it is still unclear how well it can generalize. The dataset used for evaluation consists of only 4 colors and all images are high resolution (1920x1080), and cables are placed at a similar distance to the camera and there is limited appearance variation. This can be seen from both training and validation data. This simplifies the problem a lot and can affect the performance of the model when it is tested on more realistic scenarios. For example, when there are \"cables in the wild\" which have diverse colors and are twisted with each other, or far away from the camera, or have large appearance variance in the training and testing sets, the proposed model may fail. It would be helpful to see how the model performs under this case, so that readers have a better understanding of its behavior on different data.\n\n- The text prompts evaluated are quite limited. Only 3 choices are used, which seem not have enough coverage. In addition, all the 3 text prompts are single words that behave as class labels. Given that both the CLIPSeg and SAM model are very strong at recognizing a broad range of textual concepts. I would like to know how the proposed model reacts towards more complex, detailed text prompts - whether this could improve or reduce the model quality.\nIn page 7, the authors claim \"we observe that the model generalizes better if it is trained using augmentations in the dataset\". However, the improvement is very marginal on some data, e.g., from 97.01 to 97.71, which is larger on some other data. Any explanation to that?\n\n- Some sentences are broken:\n   - In Section 2.2, \"However,Struggingle to\" should be corrected. \n   - In Section 2.2, \"its prompt encoder with a single capable\" should be corrected."
