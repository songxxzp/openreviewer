I encourage the authors to include the promised changes in their updated manuscript. I read the other reviews and rebuttal and do not see the negative points raised as a significant reason to reject this paper. I have raised my score to an 8.\n\n\nNormalising flows are probabilistic machine learning models that are capable of jointly solving the task of density estimation and generative modelling (sampling). Unfortunately, since they are parameterised in terms of a pushforward and their log-likelihood is determined using a change-of-variables formula involving a Jacobian, the mappings involved must be invertible, and are often even more constrained (e.g. through coupling layers). Invertibility imposes a big constraint on the model, meaning that the only lever one may pull to obtain expressiveness is often the depth and overparameterisation of the neural network. This results in data-hungriness, and makes them highly unsuitable for modelling tabular and low-dimensional data.\n\nThe authors introduce a kernelised version of normalising flows, which are suitable for modelling low-dimensional and tabular data. Efficacy is demonstrated on a set of benchmark datasets."

                "value": "- I believe the following statement, after the proof of Proposition 3.1, is misleading (or possibly even incorrect): \"Note that, in contrast to the classical representer theorem, since the objective doesn\u2019t contain a strictly convex regularisation term that penalises the model complexity, the solution is not necessarily unique\". I believe the authors might be referring to Theorem 1 of Scholkopf et al. 2001. In this classical representer theorem, the objective need not be convex, nor does the regularisation term need to be complex, nor does the solution need to be unique, nor does a convex regularisation term even necessarily enforce that the solution is unique (or, more weakly, that the objective is convex). The theorem simply says that any minimiser (if it exists), must be a finite linear combination of the kernel evaluations. It is true that in many typical applications of the representer theorem (e.g. kernel ridge regression, L2 penalised kernel logistic regression), the loss is strictly convex and the regularisation is strongly convex so the overall objective is strongly convex. However more generally, the theorem applies to non-convex objectives.\n- \"This makes kernelised flows especially promising for learning in the low-data regime, as their model complexity naturally scales with dataset size and does not over-parametrise as much as neural networks\", however there remains the previously mentioned caveat that the number of layers L is still a hyperparameter and increases model complexity. One can still over-parameterise with increasing L, or am I wrong?\n\nI am willing to update my scores if the authors can respond to these weaknesses, and also help me understand the answers to my questions below."

                "value": "Could the authors please clarify the weaknesses mentioned above? Specifically:\n- Is the discussion around the representer theorem accurate?\n- Can the model be overparameterised by increasing L, and how does this fit into the discussion around suitability of non-overparameterised/data hungry models for tabular / low dimensional data regimes?\n\nAdditional questions (neither strengths nor weaknesses)\n- I missed why the method is called \"Ferumal\". Can the authors quickly explain (apologies if this is mentioned somewhere already in the paper)?\n- Is there any method of constraining the support of the distribution (e.g. to lie on the simplex or some other set)? Perhaps this is as simple as constraining the support of the base distribution p_Z?\n- \"Our study highlighted that Ferumal flows exhibit faster convergence rates, thanks to the inductive biases imparted by data-dependent initialisation and parameter efficiency.\" I missed where the authors talked about data-dependent initialisation. Is this because the kernel matrix is seen as a parameter, which is initialised directly from the data, and then the auxiliary points are learned?\n- Future work. Is there a possibility to use deep kernel learning to learn the kernel as well? Would this be possible under MLE / MAP estimation, or is another objective required?\n- Future work. Can these be trained in a Bayesian manner? If the ELBO is used as an objective, can the representer theorem still be applied?\n- Open question: When is density estimation/sample generation of tabular data of practical concern in a machine learning context? I can see how sample generation is particularly interesting for high dimensional structured data (e.g. images). \n\n\nRelated works:\nThe authors might like to mention the more recent related literature of kernel methods for nonnegative functions as a way of building kernel-based probability density functions, which are also applicable and demonstrated in low dimensional / tabular data regimes, as well as their related neural-network based models through the NNGP. These also do not require invertibility.
