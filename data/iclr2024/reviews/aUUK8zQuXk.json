While the authors suggest that these companies aid in evaluation, it's unclear how they contribute to discerning investment potential. Is this truly a pivotal consideration in making investment decisions?\n2.\tThe dataset's applicability to broader scenarios remains uncertain. The study primarily focuses on tasks associated with similar quantification, neglecting other essential knowledge graph tasks like relation extraction among companies and predicting a company's industry.\n3.\tThe methodology for constructing the test dataset is nebulous. There's no explicit mention of the criteria used to select companies for this dataset. Additionally, the annotation procedure lacks clarity. What guidelines did the annotators follow? An in-depth analysis, including consistency checks, would substantiate the dataset's annotation accuracy.\n4.\tAlthough the creation of the company knowledge graph is touted as a significant contribution of the paper, the GNN-based methods designed for the Knowledge Graph don't outperform the embedding proximity method in SP and SR tasks. This raises questions about the unique value the constructed knowledge graph brings to the table, especially in the context of company similarity quantification.\n5.\tThe section on related works could benefit from a more comprehensive coverage. It notably omits in-depth discussions on state-of-the-art techniques such as GNN-based approaches on Knowledge Graphs (KG), including KBGAT [1] and RGHAT [2], as well as Language Model (LM) based methods on KGs like SimKGC [3] and LMKE [4]. Additionally, the article lacks baseline comparisons for these methodologies.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Deepak Nathani, Jatin Chauhan, Charu Sharma, and Manohar Kaul. 2019.
