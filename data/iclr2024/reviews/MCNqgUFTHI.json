                "value": "In this paper, the authors proposed to leverage LLM for goal-oriented dialogues. The motivation is that the current LLM are trained to passively follow instruction, and goal-oriented dialogues requires LLM to actively drive the conversation.\nThe authors proposed a plug-and-play dialogue policy planner. At each turn, this planner proposes a pre-defined action, and that action is translated into a template-based natural language instruction. Finally, LLM conditions on the instruction and dialogue history to generate the next response.\nDuring training, two LLMs are used to generate self-play dialogues and the third LLM is used to score the dialogues. RL is used to then optimize the planner."

It would be more interesting if it can not only select but also generate prompts, and if PPDPP can be integrated into the dialogue LLM (to avoid to use another pre-trained roBERTa model)."

Authors introduce a tunable language model plug-in, allowing LLM-powered dialogue system to adapt to various cases and applications by simply substituting the learned plug-in. PPDPP outperforms existing LLM-based dialogue systems in negotiation, emotional support, and tutoring dialogues, showcasing its effectiveness in improving proactive dialogues."
