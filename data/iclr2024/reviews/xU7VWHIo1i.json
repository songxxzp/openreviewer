However, they use a specific distribution for $n_c$, and don't discuss the impact of this assumption on how applicable the graph is to real-world applications.\n- Similarly, it is unclear to me how this graph relates to the causal or anti-causal tasks typically defined. For instance, how would the graph map to a segmentation task? I believe this relates to the assumption of a lack of direct influence between $X$ and $Y$.\n- I found the discussion missing, with no mention of limitations.\n- While the obtained method is different, the current work can be related to that of Alabdulmohsin et al., 2023 [1], which also investigates latent shift. It would be great to discuss the $n$ and $z$ variables compared to the proxies in [1] and whether some cases would be more adapted to one method or the other, or whether the authors believe their method would be superior (and why).\n \n[1] https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/alabdulmohsin23a/alabdulmohsin23a.pdf"

                "value": "This paper is highly incremental, and moreover, suffers from many technical flaws. \n\nFirst, its causal graph, learning method, and identifiability analysis are very similar to existing works [1, 2]. The only difference may lie in the addition modeling of the causal generation from $z_c$ to $z_s$. However, this assumption may not be widely applicable. Particularly, in the Terra Incognita data and PACS data considered, the authors failed to elaborate why $z_c \\to z_s$ (this is important, since without this edge, the causal graph is the same as [1]). Besides, the identifiability analysis is also a simple application of [3]. \n\nSecond, I am not sure the identifiability result is right for me. In the derivation of Eq. (19), the authors exploited the d-separation between $n_s$ (or $\\hat{n}_s$) and $y$ given $u$, however, this separation does not necessarily means $n_c$ only depends on $\\hat{n}_c$, since the inclusion of $\\hat{n}_s$ does not violate the dependency between $n_c$ and $y$ (given $u$). Besides, the parameterization of the variational posterior does not follow the dependency constraints implied in Fig. 2 (a). Specifically, given $x$, $n_c$ and $n_s$ are no longer independent, since $x$ is the collider in the path between $n_c$ and $n_s$. \n\nLast but not least, the compared baselines do not rely on the unlabeled data in the target domain (such as IRM), while it has been exploited in the term of $L_{ENT}$ (Eq. (9)). Without the ablation study, it is not clear whether the advantages come from this additional term. Besides, as the theoretical results have proven the identifiability of $z_c$, this term seems redundant. \n\n\n[1] Sun, Xinwei, et al. \"Recovering latent causal factor for generalization to distributional shifts.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 16846-16859.\n[2] Lu, Chaochao, et al. \"Invariant causal representation learning for out-of-distribution generalization.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2021.\n[3] Khemakhem, Ilyes, et al. \"Variational autoencoders and nonlinear ica: A unifying framework.\" International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics.
