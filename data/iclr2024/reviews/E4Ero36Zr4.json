In most complex RL tasks, the learner algorithm needs access to hundreds and thousands of units of experience. I do not see how the theory presented can help analyse the TSCL approaches in these more complex settings, such as understanding the conditions under which TSCL is effective. \n- This is a minor problem with respect to the presentation of the paper.

Given a particular TSCL method, how do you use a similar analysis to evaluate if the curriculum found by the given TSCL method is useful or not?\n- It is mentioned that the experimental result in classical games \"contrasts with folk knowledge in population-based training\". How to interpret this result? It should be briefly summarised in the main paper. \n- Can you explain the practical use of analysing TSCL algorithms from the proposed game-theoretic and data-centric perspective?"

The paper proposed a data-centric view of the learning process and treat each learning sample as a unit of experience, which could be a batch, dataset, or even an environment. Then each unit of experience is formulated as a player in the game-theoretical framework. The paper considered teacher as an agent to select unit of experience over time with the goal of steering learner's policy to meet some target objective, e.g., maximize performance on a target evaluation set. Using multi-armed bandit as the selection policy for unit of experience, the paper argued that curriculum learning achieves monotonic model improvement when the game is cooperative in nature. Extensive experiments on supervised learning, reinforcement learning among others demonstrate that the new game-theoretic angle is indeed helpful in gaining better insight of curriculum learning."
