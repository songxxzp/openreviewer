Some examples include \"Section A\", \"Appendix Appendix D\", \"4.1\", \"Appendix subsubsection E.2.1\".\n- There is a \"Table 4.2\" in section 4.2. And \"Table 5\" in section 5 should actually refer to Table 2.\n- The authors use past tense and present tense alternatively throughout the paper.\n- There is a typo \"Knowdledge\" in the first paragraph of the introduction.\n- In Algorithm 2, the symbol between \"similarity_score\" and \"threshold\" is not correctly shown.\n- In section 4.6, the authors represent disease and the set of diseases as  $d$ and $D$. However, in section 4.1, they are referred as $c_{input}$ and $C$, respectively.\n- In section 4.6, the authors \"average over multiple occurrences of the relation of the type $t$ between $e$ and $d$.\" However, I believe the variable $e$ is never introduced in the paper.\n\n2. It is unclear how the constructed knowledge graph is evaluated. The authors only mention that \"the evaluation is done based on precision and recall\", but the process of the evaluation is not addressed. What are the ground truth labels here?\n\n3. In section 4.1, the authors mention using the BioBERT NER model to extract a list of diseases. However, an evaluation of its accuracy is missing. It's possible that the NER model could introduce some erroneous information or ignore any essential diseases.\n\n4. In section 4.1, it is said that \"If the similarity is above some threshold, we add the result to the result list.\" Here, the authors should explicitly mention the exact value of the threshold and discuss how it is determined.\n\n5. In the right part of Figure 1, it is unclear which sentences are inputs and which sentences are LLM responses. For example, the paragraph \"If the question is not related to the context, ...\" is within the \"###Response\" block, but it seems to be an input instead.\n\n6. For the prompt designs, it would be better for the authors to discuss the reasons why they have such designs and why these designs could help.\n\n7. In section 4.6, it is inappropriate to say that \"The numbers are chosen arbitrarily and they may be tuned for a dataset.\" The authors should study the effect of these hyperparameters and justify how they are chosen in the experiments to enhance reproducibility. Similarly, in section 4.7, the authors should also discuss why the threshold of the similarity score is set to 0.8."

This study examines whether or not they can be extracted automatically from clinical point-of-care notes.\n\n## Why is it impactful?\nAutomatic construction of KGs would greatly accelerate the fields in biomedical science that rely on structured knowledge bases (of which there are many).\n\n## Why is it technically challenging/interesting (e.g., why do naive approaches not work)?\nAutomatic KG construction relies on many techniques, including entity and relationship recognition, extraction, and normalization; parsing long documents in context; reasoning over clinical language; etc. All of these are rich areas of NLP that present longstanding research challenges.\n\n## Why have existing approaches failed?\nThere are a host of existing approaches in the realm of automatic construction of KGs given LLMs. The authors reference almost none of these in their work, which reflects a major failing to contextualize their work in the context of related literature. These methods include the following:\n  1. https://openreview.net/forum?id=ntIq8Wm79G-\n  2. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04676.pdf\n  3. A number of papers from this list: https://github.com/zjukg/KG-LLM-Papers\n\n## What is this paper's contribution?\n  1. This paper releases a set of prompts that can help future researchers produce methods that automatically construct knowledge graphs given prompt-based LLM systems of various kinds.\n  2. They also perform an evaluation of the efficacy of building KGs from text leveraging a variety of LLM architectures.\n\n## How do these methods compare to prior works?\n  1. There is insufficient comparison with prior works to say here. This is a major weakness of the work."

You fail to sufficiently contextualize your advancement in the significant body of related literature in this space. There are a number of papers that complete or otherwise generate knowledge graphs via LLMs, and you don't reference or compare to these at all.\n  2. You don't state that you plan to actually release the constructed knowledge graph. This seems a major limitation when such a graph would be a resource to the community, were it extracted in a meaningful way. While this may be because you are actually constructin per-patient KGs (and if so then this should be a minor weakness, not a key weakness) that is not sufficiently clearly stated in the text to alleviate this concern.\n  3. If your KG is not patient specific, but is instead intended to capture general biomedical knowledge, it is not clear why using clinical point-of-care notes (as opposed to the clinical scientific literature) is the appropriate information source to use. Wouldn't scientific text be more accurate for capturing general information? If you are intending to capture per-patient information, why? For what will such information be used, and why should that be captured via unstructured clinical notes rather than structured information? These things need to be explained.\n  4. Ultimately, the biggest weakness other than the lack of comparison to prior art is that this is likely just not well aligned with this venue. You do not have any significant methodological novelty here, and that is a key focus for ICLR. This is also not about representation learning, or really method development within ML at all, but is rather an (albeit important) application within NLP for health and biomedicine. Perhaps re-submitting to a venue more targeted to NLP contributions and applications (such as ACL, or possibly even better, EMNLP) would be more appropriate (though if the AC disagrees about the suitability I will of course retract this concern).\n\n## Minor Weaknesses (things I dislike, but wouldn't sway me on their own)"

                "value": "The paper provides an end-to-end approach  using LLMS for the construction of KGs from EMRs. it focuses on identifying notes in EMRs that are specific to certain diseases. To do this, they create template questions that look for specific types of information, such as treatments, contributing factors, and coexisting conditions. They experiment with different LLM structures - encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder. They introduce guided instruction-based prompting to interact with LLMs."

Understanding how complex this dataset is compared to others would be really helpful. The paper also says that their method has precision 0.98 and recall of 1. But these scores are difficult to believe without comparing them to other standard results. The paper could be improved by giving more details about how this dataset stacks up against others, or by testing the method on different datasets that already exist. Right now, the paper isn't clear enough, and the reviewer has listed some questions that need clear answers to help understand the study better."
