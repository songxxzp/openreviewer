This head prevents naive token copying and corresponding analysis can explain negative heads in prior works. Moreover, the paper presents evidence of copy suppression's role in self-repair, where downstream neural network components compensate for crucial part ablation. In a narrow task, copy suppression explains 39% of the behavior."

For example, Figure 1 shows a illustration of L10H7's copy suppression mechanism, which is not easy for readers to understand.

It was not clear to me what this work contributes on top of these works.\n2. It is not clear why we should care about a single head in GPT-2 Small (a model that few people use in practical settings anymore). If similar heads could be identified across a wider variety of models that would increase the generality and perhaps interest.\n3. Even if \"1.\" and \"2.\" is achieved, it is not clear to me how these findings would be actionable. I don't necessarily think that all interpretability research needs to be actionable, but it makes the relevance of the interpretations much more convincing if there is a path to better system building, more fair/generalizable models, etc."
