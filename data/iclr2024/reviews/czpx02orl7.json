A major differentiator from symbolic approaches is the idea that these state abstractions should be continuous rather than discrete. The key assumption is that you are given a set of options and a dataset obtained by rolling them out. Experiments are conducted in a few simple domains: pinball and antmaze, and demonstrate that the learned abstractions are sensible."

                "value": "Unfortunately, I recommend rejection for this paper due to 4 major reasons: 1) unconvincing experiments, 2) missing key citations to related work, 3) issues in technical details, and 4) unclear motivation.\n\n1) unconvincing experiments\n\nThe experiments in this paper are very basic and only serve as a simple proof-of-concept that the learned abstractions are somewhat useful. To really scale up the experiments to the level expected for a conference paper, I would expect to see evidence that the learned abstractions are useful in more hierarchical domains (e.g., classic domains from the options literature like keys and doors). In such domains, we could test whether the value-preserving property holds empirically, by comparing the values from planning under the abstract model to the (ground truth) values from planning under the true model.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to see comparisons to many more RL algorithms, especially hierarchical ones like HIRO (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08296), HVF (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05829), and Director (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04114). This is because at the end of the day, the authors are proposing to learn a state encoder $\\phi$, and despite all the theory that has gone into their algorithm, the question that must be answered is whether this $\\phi$ outperforms the encoders learned by all these other SOTA hierarchical RL algorithms.\n\n2) missing key citations to related work\n\nThe authors are missing several key citations, the most important of which is the line of work by David Abel, such as \"Near optimal behavior via approximate state abstraction\" (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/abel16.html) and \"Value preserving state-action abstractions\" (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/abel20a/abel20a.pdf). Those papers have very similar theory to what appears in this one, and so the novelty of the proposed approach is unclear. There are also less-famous but still important-to-cite papers from other authors, like \"Abstract value iteration for hierarchical reinforcement learning\" (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/jothimurugan21a/jothimurugan21a.pdf) and \"Deciding what to model: Value-equivalent sampling for reinforcement learning\" (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/3b18d368150474ac6fc9bb665d3eb3da-Abstract-Conference.html). It is important for the authors to contextualize the contributions of this paper against all these related works.\n\n3) issues in technical details\n\nThe authors say in Section 3.2 that when B = \\bar{B}, \"then simulating a trajectory in the abstract model is the same as in the ground model\". But I don't think this is true, because we need the rewards to match between the two trajectories too, and $B_t$ says nothing about rewards, only dynamics. The authors go on to say: \"Therefore, planning in the abstract model is accurate, in the sense, that the value of an abstract state z computed in the abstract model is the same as the one would get from trajectories from the ground MDP for the abstraction operator G.\" Again, I think this is wrong because it ignores the abstract reward function, which could be arbitrarily different from the ground one. In fact, in the proof of corollary 3.8, the authors assume $E_{s \\sim G(\\cdot \\mid z)}[R(s, o)] = \\bar{R}(z, o)$, and it's only _under this assumption_ that the claims hold. But combining this assumption on reward function with Definition 3.6 ends us back up at the bisimulation conditions, and then it's not clear what the contributions of this paper are.\n \nAs a separate point, the second term in the mutual information expression of Section 4.2, $MI(S'; Z, A)$, seems very extreme! It is saying that you have to be able to predict the entire ground next state from the current abstract state and action. Doesn't this means the abstraction can't lose any information? This seems like an important technical limitation of the approach.\n\n4) unclear motivation\n\nThe authors often state that a discrete abstract state space is bad, when pointing to work on symbolic abstraction learning (e.g., PDDL). But it's not clear why this is really bad. The authors say discrete abstract states are \"not applicable when planning with the available high-level actions requires a continuous state representation\", but this doesn't make sense to me, as the options have to act in the ground environment states, not in the abstract state space, and so the options could be defined with respect to either a discrete or a continuous abstract state space. Furthermore, it can be much easier to plan in a discrete abstraction (e.g., using powerful symbolic planners).\n\nI believe a fruitful research direction would be to compare the abstractions learned by a symbolic approach against the abstractions learned by a continuous approach (like the authors')."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Questions:\n* Not much is said about the dataset $\\mathcal{D}$, but intuitively, it has to be \"good\" in order for the learned state abstraction to be reasonable. In particular, the agent must see all the options being executed in a variety of settings, and obtain good coverage over the state-action space. Are there any concrete statements we can make about what properties we need this dataset to have?\n* \"we must build a model of its effect\" Do you mean to say \"of the effect of each option\"?\n* \"with mean value equal to that by planning with the original MDP\" What is the mean over?\n* Why did we switch from using O (denoting the option set) everywhere to using A throughout Section 4? Shouldn't we continue to use O, unless I am misunderstanding something?\n* Section 4.3: Why should there be any cost/reward associated with executing skills? Shouldn't a sparse reward for reaching the goal be enough?\n* Eq 2: What are the \"I\" random variables inside the mutual information expression referring to?\n\nMinor edits:\n* \"make the same decision\" To clarify, we just need that the policy maps all states in z to the same action distribution. A stochastic policy isn't really committing to a \"decision\" about what action to take.\n* \"Abstractions alleviate this tension: action abstractions enable agents to plan at larger temporal scales and state abstractions reduce the complexity of learning and planning\" I would say that both of them do both of these. Action abstractions certainly reduce the complexity of planning, which is typically exponential in the branching factor.\n* \"learns a further abstraction\" --> \"learn a further abstraction\"\n* \"otherwise it is referred as learning\" I would say \"policy learning\" to distinguish from other things you might learn\n* \"when it is the given position\" --> \"when it is in the given position\"\n* \"referred as learning\" --> \"referred to as learning\"\n* \"results a bounded value loss\" --> \"results in a bounded value loss\"\n* In definition 3.5, the authors use $s_o$ in a few places where they mean $s_0$."

The key idea is to allow agents to construct reusable abstract models for planning with specific skills. This is achieved by characterizing the state abstraction that ensures planning without any loss in simulation, meaning that planning with the learned abstract model can generate policies for the real world. The paper also provides theoretical support for the use of information maximization as a reliable strategy for learning abstract state representations."

It would be stronger if the experiment was done in more complex environments with much longer-horizon tasks, such as AntMaze experiments (Hafner 2022) or robotic manipulation tasks [b].\n\n* Similarly, the comparisons in Figure 5 are essentially between model-free RL (ground) and model-based RL (abstract), which does not seem fair. It might be fair to compare the proposed method with other model-based RL approaches, such as Dreamer and TD-MPC.\n\n* Exhaustive comparisons to the alternatives to the dynamics preserving abstraction would be interesting, such as bisimulation.\n\n* Some highly relevant works on temporally-extended models [a,b] are missing in the paper. Proper comparisons to these approaches are necessary.\n\n[a] Shi et al. Skill-based Model-based Reinforcement Learning. CoRL 2022\n[b] Zhang et al.

                "value": "Please address the weaknesses mentioned above.\n\n\n### Minor questions and suggestions\n\n* Figure 1 may want to explain why abstract state representations and options are helpful for planning and learning. However, Figure 1 does not seem to help understand the paper. To understand this figure, we first need to know about options and abstract state representations, and how they simplify planning.\n\n* In Section 4.2, it is unclear whether $\\mathcal{L}^T_{\\theta, \\phi}$ is used to update $f_\\phi$ or not.\n\n* For multi-goal experiments in the paper, using the same amount of environment steps for the abstract planning and the ground baseline would make it easier to understand how better or worse a method is.\n\n* The appendix could be included in the main paper for easier navigation.\n\n* What is the difference between Figure 7 and 8?\n\n* Training the abstract planning method longer in Figure 7 and 8 would be helpful to see how it learns. Using different x-scales for two methods is okay but it would be better to have the same scale.\n\n* Many minor typos in the paper."
