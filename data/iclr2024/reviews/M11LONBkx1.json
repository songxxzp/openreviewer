Authors claim that more distinctive representations are crucial for classification tasks, but I have concern that randomly injected synthetic features can lead to lower intra-class node representation similarity thus can be harmful on downstream tasks. In my opinion, discussion on aforementioned concern is required.\n-\tIt is required to include the time complexity of presented method. Since V_{k}^{(a)} differs by channel \u2018a\u2019 as synthetic feature-injected node differs by channels, diffusion process should be done by channels. Moreover, as presented method further requires pre-diffusion process, presented FISF seems to have much higher time complexity compared to existing methods, especially FP.\n-\tAs presented in the Table 5 in the Appendix, hyperparameters have been tuned with respect to each feature missing rate r_m. Regarding complexity of setting optimal hyperparameters, there is some concern about practical usage of FISF. \n-\tLastly, considering the similarity of Label Propagation (LP) and FP, and the argument about low variance channels (in respect of very high missing feature rates), I think this paper shares similar motivation with Poisson Learning [1], which mitigates very low label rate problem in LP. Poisson Learning points out that LP outputs almost constant pseudo-labels for most of unlabeled samples, while this paper points out existing diffusion-based methods including FP causes \u201clow variance channels\u201d, i.e. almost constant features (or an exact constant when there is only one observed feature value, as presented in this paper).

Although the authors demonstrated the existence of a low-variance channel after current diffusion-based methods, FP and PCFI, the link explaining how these low-variance channels act as a bottleneck for overall performance is not comprehensively provided. For example, the performance of node classification could be provided after excluding some portions of low-variance channels. Additionally, I am curious whether the original variance of the dataset, without any missing features, shows low variance as depicted in Figure 1. In this context, the authors should explain why a low-variance channel is especially burdensome in scenarios with missing features.\n  \n2. I wonder if the low-variance problem is due to zero-initialization. In cases of severe missing data and zero-initialization is equipped, the majority of the feature matrix would consist of zeros, so the output matrix would naturally contain many zeros (i.e., biases, if adding biases is enabled), especially considering that most graph datasets use one-hot encoding via bag-of-words for feature matrices. If the initialization for the missing feature were from random sampling, such as a uniform or normal distribution, the low variance problem might be easily addressed.\n  \n3. Although diffusion via synthetic features can enhance the distinctiveness across features, it might undermine the GNN's key inductive bias, which is the smoothness across connected nodes. A more in-depth discussion of the trade-off between feature distinctiveness and the smoothness of connected features should be provided.\n  \n4. While the authors proposed the use of synthetic features, excluding this module, the pre-diffusion and diffusion with synthetic features are exactly aligned with the existing work, PCFI. This raises concerns about the overall novelty of this paper.\n  \n5. The complexity of FISF compared to existing works is not comprehensively addressed. Given that the adjacency matrix is created for each feature dimension, the complexity would be exceedingly high, potentially limiting the practical application of FISF.\n  \n6. The proposed missing rates of 0.995 and 0.999 seem unrealistic. Furthermore, edge information can also be missing in real-world scenarios, a factor that should be considered."
