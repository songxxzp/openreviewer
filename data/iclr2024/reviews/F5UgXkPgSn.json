It uses points in the Grassmannian as intermediaries and relies on the geometry of this Riemannian manifold for local convergence guarantees. Notably, this method doesn't require prior knowledge of the number of subspaces, can handle noisy data, and only needs an upper bound on the subspaces' dimensions. The paper also covers practical techniques for clustering, data completion, model selection, and sketching. Experiment results, both with synthetic and real data, indicate that this approach performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods in easy cases with high sampling rates and significantly surpasses them in challenging cases with low sampling rates, narrowing the gap towards the fundamental sampling limit of HRMC."

The presented concepts appear standard and do not introduce any novel insights. Additionally, widely available libraries like Pymanopt can automatically handle Riemannian gradients and appropriate retractions and line searches, making the inclusion of this optimization section less valuable. The complexity of the geodesic method used may not be practical, and it's rarely applied in practice. Furthermore, Theorem 2.1 seems to be a direct application of Proposition 4.7 from \"An introduction to optimization on smooth manifolds\" from Nicolas Boumal, which raises questions about the originality of this contribution.\n\n3) The paper lacks transparency in explaining how hyperparameters are tuned, and the performance results shown in Figure 5 are not very promising.

                "value": "The paper considers a high-rank matrix completion problem (HRMC), which is a well-studied combination of a matrix completion and a union of subspaces problem. The HRMC consists of assigning each column, of a given $m\\times n$ matrix with missing entries, to a linear subspace, while minimising the number of such subspaces.\n\nThe main innovation of the reviewed work is the optimization problem formulated in eq (1) on pg. 2. The authors claim that HRMC can be well solved by an optimization over a product of a number of $n$ Grassmannian manifolds $\\mathcal{G}(m,r)$, while minimizing the average distance of all the subspaces in respect to each other. The main theoretical statement is Theorem 2.1. on page 4, which is the consequence of the existing theory of Riemannian optimization to show convergence to a critical point, although the proof seems to be messy and use inconsistent notation. Although the paper at times does not use suitable terminology of Riemannian optimization, the derived update formula in eq (4) and above, is in fact a Riemannian gradient descent that exploits the known closed form expression for exponential retractions on Grassmannian manifold. The theoretical sampling limit is discussed on top of the page 6, and the authors cite the existing literature that sample complexity of HMRC is identical to matrix completion, but without stating what this means. The practical aspects of the algorithm are considered in Section 4, where the authors discuss the existing literature of clustering algorithms that could be applied to compute the number of subspaces. Section 5 provides numerical experiments on synthetic and real world datasets, which support that the optimization is an interesting concept, but do not achieve state-of-the-art results."

The proof of Theorem 2.1. does not seem to have consistent notation for the theorem. This is also seen in other parts of the paper, e.g. the notation of S and G for the Grasmannian manifold is inconsistent.\n2) Although it is true that the Riemannian framework allows to show convergence to a critical point, the more interesting point is to investigate how the sample complexity affects the well-posedness of this formulation, and more importantly, the choice of the clustering algorithm for the n^2 matrix of distances. \n3) There is very little practical or theoretical investigation of how the clustering algorithm affects overall performance.\n4) The algorithm requires to compute distances between n^2 subspaces, making it computationally challenging. \n\nOverall, I think the paper presents an interesting concept, but in its present form, it **does not** answer the interesting questions about it:\n1) What are the situations for the proposed method to outperform the existing methods?\n2) What are the requirments on the clustering method, and the number of subspaces, for the method to work well?\n3) How to computationally deal with the n^2 matrix of distances?

In other words, there will be always intersecting lin. subspace between U_i and X_i.\n2) Can you explain what is the proved convergence rate and how Theorem 2.1. goes beyond of just applying the existing results for Riemannian gradient descent?"
