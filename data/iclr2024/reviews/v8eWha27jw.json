                "value": "This works addresses the problem of communication-efficient distributed mean estimation (DME), a common subroutine in distributed optimization, and improves the SOTA of quantization techniques. It proposes QUIC-FL, the first quantization scheme that is efficient in both encoding and decoding and achieves the optimal NMSE, the metric of the estimation error, of $O(1/n)$ at the same time, where $n$ is the number of clients. QUIC-FL is based on two key ideas: 1) Bounded support quantization (BSQ), which sends a few large coordinates exactly and quantizes only the rest few. 2) An optimization framework that optimizes the set of quantization values to further reduce the estimation error, based on the limiting distribution of transformed coordinates of the client vectors, i.e., the normal distribution. Furthermore, QUIC-FL discusses the usage of client-specific shared randomness and the RHT rotation to practically gain constant improvement in the estimation error. Finally, extensive experiments show advantages of QUIC-FL compared to several SOTA quantization schemes in terms of encoding time, decoding time and NMSE."

The reader has no idea about the techniques this work uses to improve DME and the novelty of the techniques after reading it. It should at least mention, for example, one idea QUIC-FL builds on is BSQ which sends exactly a few large coordinates and quantizes the rest small ones.\n\n-\tIn Introduction, the paragraph starting with \u201cFor example, in Suresh et al. 2017 \u2026\u201d, it is mentioned the entropy encoding is \u201ccompute-intensive\u201d. How long does the decoding time of this approach take? Table 1 does not include entropy encoding as a baseline.\n\n-\tIt is mentioned in Introduction that the decoding procedure of \u201centropy encoding\u201d from a previous work is \u201ccompute-intensive\u201d. What is the time complexity of this decoding procedure? It seems this approach is not included in Table 1 as a baseline for comparison.\n\n-\tThe Lloyd-Max quantizer appears at several places in the work, e.g., in Introduction, and in serving as the Lower Bound in Section 3.5. However, this work does not introduce this quantizer properly. Can the authors give a brief introduction of this quantizer and in which cases is it optimal?\n\n-\tThe paragraph \u201cwhile the above methods suggest \u2026\u201d is abrupt and confusing. It\u2019d be better to move this paragraph before surveying existing quantization techniques in Introduction.\n\n-\tIn Section 2 preliminaries, it would be clearer if \u201cunbiased algorithms and independent estimators\u201d can be formally and clearly defined. Minor issue: \u201cwe that NMSE \u2026\u201d => \u201cwe want that NMSE \u2026\u201d\n\n-\tThe uniform random rotation appears at several places in the work. What exactly is this rotation? Is it a uniform Gaussian random rotation?\n\n-\tIn Section 3.5 \u201caccelerating QUIC-FL with RHT\u201d, \u201cadversarial vectors\u201d are mentioned but not introduced. It is confusing how the proposed approach compares against DRIVE and EDEN in terms of the application to \u201cadversarial vectors\u201d.\n\n-\tIn Section 3.5 \u201caccelerating QUIC-FL with RHT\u201d, it states \u201cthe result does not have the additive NMSE term is [because] we directly analyze the error for the Hadamard-rotated coordinates\u201d. Can the author be more formal and specific how the analysis here is different from the one in Theorem 3.1?\n\n-\tSeveral places in the work states in plain text the performance of QUIC-FL with different values of its hyperparameters. For example, in Section 3.5 \u201caccelerating QUIC-FL with RHT\u201d, it states the NMSE of QUIC-FL is bounded by \u2026 with $b = 1,2,3,4$. It\u2019d be easier for the readers if those numbers can be turned into figures. \n\nThis work claims the proposed QUIC-FL has NMSE $O(1/n)$.  However, by Theorem 3.1, the actual NMSE is indeed $O(1/n \\cdot \\sqrt{\\log d / d})$. It does not seem to be OK to omit the $O(\\sqrt{\\log d / d})$ term and directly write $O(1/n \\cdot \\sqrt{\\log d / d}) = O(1/n)$."

In the first optimization problem on page 4, the notations $S(z, x)$ and $R(x)$ are a bit confusing. Are $S$ and $R$ two functions to be optimized? Is $R(x)$ essentially a vector of $2^b$ variables? Is $S(z, x)$ a continuous function?\n\nSimilarly, in the second optimization problem (i.e., the discretized version of the first problem), is $S\u2019(i, x)$ essentially a vector of $m \\cdot 2^b$ variables to be optimized?\n\nSince the number of variables to be optimized is on the order of $2^b$, how efficient is the second optimization problem?\n\n$\\textbf{Communication cost. }$\nOne concern is that the proposed QUIC-FL requires extra bits to send a few large coordinates exactly along with their indices, while the baseline quantization schemes usually allocate a fixed number of bits per coordinate. This makes QUIC-FL use more communication cost compared to the baseline. And hence it might not be fair to directly compare QUIC-FL\u2019s NMSE against that of the baselines. How does the author compare in Table 1? Also, how does the author address this in the experiments?\n\n$\\textbf{Optimality. }$\nIt is mentioned at several places that the optimal NMSE of any quantization is $O(1/n)$ (this lower bound is in terms of the number of clients only, I presume). This is not rigorous in the draft. Can the authors cite the theorems that indicates the optimality? \n\nThe draft claims QUIC-FL achieves a \u201cnear-optimal\u201d NMSE. However, it seems this lower bound is only empirically obtained using the Lloyd-Max quantizer in Section 3.5. \u201cNear-optimal\u201d specifically means one can theoretically show the algorithm achieving optimality (e.g., close to a lower bound), up to a logarithmic factor. And so it might not be appropriate to claim the \u201cnear-optimality\u201d of QUIC-FL."
