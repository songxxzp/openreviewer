Regardless of the self-loop, if there are large attention values in the other neighbors than j, wouldn't \u03b1ij be small? The separation of attention parameters for self-loops and neighbors clearly affects [\u03b1ij/\u03b1ii << 1] but may not for [\u03b1ij << 1].\n- Most experiments are conducted on synthetic datasets and experiments on other real-world benchmarks are required (Lim, Derek, et al. and Platonov, Oleg, et al.). Synthetic datasets are useful lenses to analyze the model behavior but they are over-simplied versions of real-world datasets.

In the introduction, the authors claim that an effective attention mechanism should be able to block messages passed from heterophilic neighbors and constitute the remainder of this paper following this claim. However, the scenario described is only one demonstration of a successful attention mechanism. I believe that as long as the attention mechanism can project node of the same class into the similar regions on the decision manifold , it is a good attention mechanism. I think examples from this paper could be good showcases of my point [1]. \n\n2. The experiments are conducted over synthetic use cases or graphs designed for heterophily. I am wondering how's GATE's performance over benchmarks with public splits (e.g., Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed with fixed 20 nodes per class, and arxiv and product with ogb splits).\n\n3. I would recommend the authors to add a section at the end of section 3 to quickly summarize the key merits discussed in section 4 in case some readers don't want to read too many theoretical materials. I think in order to understand how GATE works requires a full understanding of section 4, which could be improved. \n\n[1] Yao Ma, et al., Is Homophily a Necessity for Graph Neural Networks? ICLR'22"

                "value": "1. It seems that GATE switches off task-irrelevant neighborhood by separating the parameters $a_t$ of the target nodes from $a_s$ of the source nodes. By this, the effect of target nodes is decreased by tuning $a_t$. The question is, when a neighborhood is switched off, all nodes in this neighborhood including those that are helpful to the task are synchronously switched off. Will this be harmful to the model's performance?\n2. GATE is able to reduce the performance drop caused by increased depth, would it be more beneficial to introduce more hops of neighbors by using deeper GATE or it is better to use a shallower one?\n3. The texts in the legends of figures are not very clear."
