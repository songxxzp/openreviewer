The paper shows that chatKBQA achieves SOTA on two KBQA datasets, but more details of the method should be clarified before determining whether the method truly achieves SOTA."

If the relationships and entities were replaced, how do we ensure that the plugged-in entities/relationships were the right one? In what percentage were the right entities/relationships being plugged in if no ground truth is available?\n- In section 4.5, the authors claim that Graph-Query-of-Thoughts are a way to improve QA\u2019s interpretability and avoid LLM\u2019s hallucinations, which has no evidence support in the result/analysis section. This seems to be an exaggerated claim and I am not convinced.\n- Presentation of the paper needs improvement. Multiple grammatical errors, and the description of the method is confusing.

Considering the authors replaced the backbone model with LLMs, it is hard to identify which parts play the key role in performance improvement. It would be better to have more ablation studies. For example, replacing LLM with the pre-trained model in baseline, such as T5, or fixing LLM and replacing the parsing and IR component with the baseline method.\n3.
