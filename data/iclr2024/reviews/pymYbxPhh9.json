                "value": "This paper proposes an attention-based distillation method that transfers knowledge between a two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN), where one stream is operating on the original image while the other uses attention-modulated images. The principal idea behind the method is to adaptively integrate a collection of randomly perturbed masks based on their corresponding predictive performance to generate reasonable attention prompts, and encourage alignment between the features and parameters for the two streams. Experimental results on two medical imaging datasets show that the proposed approach is able to outperform baseline and other visual explanation methods."

                "value": "- The paper ignores a body of research on learning with privileged information (e.g., [ref1, ref2, ref3]), which is closely related to the proposed method in terms of incomplete information during inference. In addition, leveraging a two-stream CNN for distilling privileged knowledge is also not particularly new (e.g., [ref3] also encourages alignment between features from the two streams). \n\n- According to Equation 2, the high-quality attention prompt D is never used to modulate the images in the second stream. Is there a particular reason why always using the perturbed attention prompts? \n\n- Related to the previous comment. I have difficulty understanding the design choice of the perturbed masks. Specifically, Equation 2 discards all important/unimportant pixels (lambda=+1 or -1) and only takes into account regions with unknown importance. What do we want the model to focus on regions with higher uncertainty, instead of those more prominent ones?\n\n- I am a bit concerned about the computational overhead of the model. For each image, it increases the inference by N+1 times (N is the number of perturbed masks). The alternative training also makes the cost complicated. I would suggest the authors provide a quantitative measure of the computational cost. \n\n-  The experiments are inadequate to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, mainly because of two reasons: (1) Tasks and scale of the datasets. The paper only evaluates on two small medical imaging datasets for binary classification, and it is unclear if the method can generalize toward broader domains. Moreover, for each dataset, the authors only sample a small subset of data for experiments (e.g., 100 and 30 images for training on the two datasets, respectively). With such a small scale, it is very hard to validate whether or not the method is truly advantageous. (2) Model selection. The paper only tests with ResNet-18, does the method work on other more advanced backbones? I would suggest the authors experiment with state-of-the-art networks designed for medical imaging tasks (or test on ImageNet classification). Alternatively, for a fair comparison with other visual explanation methods, it would also be reasonable to directly test on the same tasks.\n\n- For a more comprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the method, it is reasonable to perform a quantitative evaluation of the model attention to see how they align with expert annotations.\n\nReferences:\n\n[ref1] Learning Using Privileged Information: Similarity Control and Knowledge Transfer.

In detail,\n\n- The framework can be seen as a stacked version of two CNN layers, with one leveraging attention annotations while the other does not. In scenarios where attention annotations are not available, it seems that only one branch of the model is necessary, rendering the other redundant.\n\n- The advantages of the proposed attention prompt modification are not clearly conveyed. On one hand, obtaining the modified attention map requires the model to propagate each sample numerous times (equal to the number of augmented images). This can be time-consuming and degrade the efficiency. On the other hand, there have been many methods (e.g., RES) focused on improving noisy attention prompts. Yet, no comparisons are given in this regard.\n\n- The name of \u201cattention-prompt guided multi-task\u201d is confusing. While the authors show that the learning objective includes several components (e.g., classification loss, parameter/feature regularization loss), this should not be treated as \u201cmulti-tasks\u201d in my view. Because both network branches still account for the same classification problem.\n\n2. Many design choices are not self-contained. Specifically, why knowledge sharing is necessary for the two CNN networks? Can we just use the prediction from one branch as the final model decision? What are the advantages of this two-branch framework over the one-branch model?\n\n3. The results primarily focus on medical datasets. If this work specifically targets medical analysis, the authors should explicitly state it. Otherwise, it would be crucial to provide additional results on other scenarios (as referenced by RES) to showcase the applicability of the proposed method."

The paper introduces a framework that significantly reduces the need for model retraining in attention-guided learning. In particular, this work proposes a technique enabling models to utilize attention prompts directly in prediction, bypassing retraining. It also introduces a new framework adept at integrating attention prompts into decision-making and adapting to images with or without such prompts. Regarding methods, this work refine incomplete attention prompts through perturbation-based attention map modification and an innovative optimization-based mask aggregation.

There is a potential concern regarding how well the model would generalize to images significantly different from those it was trained on, especially considering that the attention prompts might not be accurate or might introduce bias towards certain features.\n4. The model includes several hyperparameters (e.g., the number of perturbed masks $N$, probability $p$, $\\lambda_1$, $\\lambda_2$, $\\lambda_3$). The process of tuning these hyperparameters is not extensively discussed. Despite the experiments shown in Fig. 4, what other insights could there be regarding the hyper-parameter tuning? The performance of the model exhibits sensitivity to the variation in $\\lambda_1$, $\\lambda_2$, and $\\lambda_3$, suggesting that careful tuning is essential for optimal performance.\n5.
