If there is a connection, it should be further clarified.\n- The authors should explain why maximizing the upper bound of the correlation between x and z promotes disentanglement, and why increasing variable informativeness enhances diversity.\n- The traversal results shown in Appendix Figure 12 are poor in terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, the paper lacks traversal images results for real world natural images (not MPI3D-real), such as CelebA.\n- The paper should provide an analysis of the sensitivity of the $\\alpha$ parameter.\n- If the answer to weakness 1 is the latter, it seems that this work is relatively incremental, as it only adds a conditional TC term to the \u03b2-TCVAE.

The experimental setting, when a diversity is evaluated by doing traversals by +-6,8,10 std. looks strange for me.\nSuch points will be never sampled from the noise. \n5. Where did hyperparameters from Appendix B come from? For example, Roth et al, 2023 provided a grid search for them. As far as rival methods are concerned, you can take hyperparameters from original papers (but in this case original training pipeline and architectures must be also used). If the hyperparameters for rival methods are selected arbitrary, experimental results are not valid!\n6. Figure 1 is not convincing. For example, row 3 for alpha-TCVAE, contains an image with a defect: non-round violet border. \nHigh diversity obviously can be achieved by generating wrong images."

How the matrix for the Vendi score is formed?\n4. FID from \"traversals\" image generation is much lower than from straightforward generation from noise. Do you have an explanation?\nAlso, it is interesting to compare VAE models via Precision/Recall (Kynk\u00e4\u00e4nniemi, T., Karras, T., Laine, S., Lehtinen, J., & Aila, T. (2019).
