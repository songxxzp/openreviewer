The authors are well explaining how certain state-of-the-art methods such as graph neural networks (GNN) are actually tested in a biased manner (not including all negative pairs, in potentially non-sparse graphs) where in practice graphs are usually sparse and not all positive pairs are known. \n\nThey also highlights performance limitations of GNN: a binary classification loss sensitive to class imbalance and the inability to learn strong topology of the data to better introduce Gelato.\n\nSteps of the algorithm are clearly stated:\n\n-The node attribution information is used to extend the set of initial edges with new ones between nodes for which similarity is higher than a specified threshold.\n\n-The new augmented graph is associated with a trainable weight which is learned via a MLP network. The final edge weights are a weighted combination of the topological, MLP-learned weights and similarity score between the node features. By design, the final graph contains both structural and attribute information. \n\n-To this enhanced graph, we associate negative pairs which are generated within node partitions obtained via the METIS algorithm (I wish there was more explanation though, not to describe METIS algorithm itself but how sampling is performed from the multiple hiearchical partitions). The objective of this process is to have hard negative pairs for the training. \n\n-Then the trainable weights of the MLP model - assumed to learn meaningful interactions between any two node attributes linked by an edge in the enhanced graph- are optimized so that to rank the positive edges between 2 nodes higher than the negative ones (instead of classifying them between positive and negative ones which is complex for very unbalanced classes). \n\nFocusing on accuracy AND scalability, it is indeed discussed how to efficiently compute the n-square Autocovariance similarity matrix (used to define the weighted adjacency matrix of the enhanced graph).\n\nCode of the approach is made publicly available, which is highly appreciated for reproducibility of the results and wide adoption of the approach by the ML community. \n\nExperiments are made on 4 public real-world datasets and Gelato is compared against 4 SOTA GNN-based approaches as well as 3 heuristics. \nThey show that Gelato is outperforming GNN-based approaches in the unbiased setting regarding link prediction performance (2nd best approach is the heuristic that Gelato is empowering with graph learning). \n\nHowever, in the bias and partitioned settings, NCN seems to be better at distinguishing positive pairs from the negative ones."

Maybe some pictures to describe the process might be helpful. \n\nAs highlighted by the authors, in the partitioned setting, NCN seems to be better at distinguishing positive pairs from the negative ones compared to Gelato. \n\nPotential limitation of the paper is that the contribution is mostly experimental (from sometimes existing blocks) and as a consequence we might expect more experiments to support the proposed approach (GNN instead of MLP in Gelato is left for future work for instance, same as for other types of ranking-based losses that could have been compared)."

Specifically, for sparse graphs, since most negative pair samples are quite different from the positive ones, metrics that sample only a few negative pairs lead to biased testing. To address this problem, this paper suggests that unbiased testing exploiting all negative samples is more persuasive, especially for sparse graphs, and even finds that unsupervised topological heuristics (Autocovariance) can outperform most advanced link prediction techniques. Under this perspective, this paper devises a novel link prediction approach, called Gelato, that is suitable for sparse graphs. Gelato contains four parts: 1) graph learning: incorporate attribute similarity, topological weights, the untrained weights, and the trained weights into the new adjacency matrix; 2) topological heuristic: borrow the heuristic from AC and use equation 6 to alleviate the memory overhead; 3) N-pair loss: relieve the sensitivity to class imbalance; 4) negative sampling: use graph partitioning to generate hard negative samples."
