What architectures do you have in mind? If I'm not mistaken, you never experiment with any such architecture for continuous G, right?\n- To make MPC equivariant, the action sampling needs to be equivariant. Just after Eq. (11), you describe as the main problem that \"action sampling is not state-dependent\". Why? Isn't the equivariant learned policy used for action sampling?\n- I wasn't able to follow the logic behind the G-sample method, could you explain that a bit more slowly, please?\n- Is it fair to compare non-equivariant and equivariant methods with equal parameter count? Usually, equi methods have less parameters than non-equivariant counterparts with similar capabilities. This choice thus strikes me as a bit unfair to the baselines."

                "value": "### 1. Experimental setup and the baselines \n* The choice of the baselines is very limited. The proposed algorithm is only compared against a non-equivariant TD-MPC. I would consider the other baselines as ablation studies of the proposed algorithm with different subgroups ($D_8$, $D_4$, $C_8$). To better evaluate the performance of the algorithm, I suggest the authors use at least one other baseline from the literature on symmetry in continuous control RL, such as [1], and at least another baseline from model-based RL, such as Dreamer [2].\n\n* The proposed algorithm is evaluated on only four environments, two of which (2D point mass and 3D point mass) are toy problems. In fact, the 2D point mass is mainly used for debugging purposes and is rarely reported in a scientific paper due to its simplicity. I suggest the authors incorporate more experiments either from the robotics literature or works on continuous symmetry in RL, such as [3].\n\n* Finally, I strongly encourage the authors to look into [9, 10] and follow their guidelines for reporting statistically significant results in RL. \n\n### 2. Overclaims and missing related work\n* The authors have overlooked some essential papers, and I have identified some of their stated contributions as overstated. On page 2 (first paragraph), they state that their approach expands on earlier research on planning on 2D grids, yet [4] has already examined the equivariant Muzero which integrates symmetries in a complex model-based planning algorithm. Furthermore, they assert that they are extending equivariant model-free RL to continuous states and actions, while [1] has already accomplished this in a broader context, not solely restricted to Euclidean symmetry. Some examples of other missing references are [5, 6].\n\n### 3. Incremental contributions\n* The definition of Geometric MDP appears to be a rebranding of MDP homomorphisms [7], which was also extended to continuous states and actions [1]. It is not clear why the authors have chosen to rename a well-studied concept in the literature by adding some restrictions on the group symmetry. This can be very misleading to an inexperienced reader.\n\n* Additionally, the contributions of this paper appear to be incremental with respect to the prior work of [7] which explored the use of symmetry in model-based planning. \n\n### 4. Discrepancy between theory and experiments\n* One of the key contributions of the paper, as claimed by the authors, is the study of continuous group symmetries in RL. Unfortunately, in their practical algorithm they are using discretized subgroups (page 8). This raises doubts regarding the soundness of the paper and the connection between theoretical analysis and the experimental results.\n\n### 4. Limiting assumptions\n* The MDP dynamics is assumed to be deterministic (page 5, second paragraph) without any justification or insight into its reason. \n\n### References\n\n[1] Rezaei-Shoshtari, S., Zhao, R., Panangaden, P., Meger, D., & Precup, D.

To investigate if Euclidean symmetry can guarantee benefits in model-based RL, this work presents a theoretical framework that studies the linearized dynamics of geometric MDPs. The theoretical results show that the matrices in linearized dynamics are G-steerable kernels, which can be used as a solution that significantly reduces the number of parameters. Inspired by the theoretical results, this work proposes an equivariant sampling-based model-based RL algorithm for Geometric MDPs. Empirical results in DeepMind Control suite demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method with continuous symmetries."

A good theoretical class description and an extensive empirical study would have been appreciated.\n\nAs of now, the paper lacks focus on multiple fronts. various Theorems, Propositions, paragraph titles and types of lists make up the main body, but do not give it structure as the parts to not naturally follow from one another. As if the paper knows that it lost some people, the paper provides a recap on its own at the beginning of section 4. Perhaps beginning with the empirical study and the example domains and deriving the theoretical class from there would be easier?\n\nThe empirical study does a good job at motivating further research but lacks a definite conclusion.
