The proposed approach suggests a significant performance improvement over other single-pretext tasks, e.g., vanilla MTL, AutoSSL, and ParetoGNN."

The proposed distillation is in an offline fashion, and the optimality of teacher has already in the objective. As a result, the constraint is a little bit unnecessary. Also, the parameters for optimization are not clearly presented in the objective."

Which may implicit exaggerate the contribution of the proposed method.\n2. How do you perform vision task in Appendix 10? Please provide more details for the graph construction. Maybe you can discuss the performance difference between different methods to build the graph.\n3. Is there more evidence for Figure 4?
