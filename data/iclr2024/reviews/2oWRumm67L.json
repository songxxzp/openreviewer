Conventional methods encounter difficulties, including high computational costs and complexities, when applied to large-scale MILPs. Light-MILPopt confronts these problems by adopting a four-stage strategy:\n\nProblem Formulation: MILPs are depicted as bipartite graphs, and computational efficiency is improved through a graph partitioning algorithm.\nModel-based Initial Solution Prediction: This stage involves using a specialized network to predict initial solutions for subproblems, necessitating less computational effort and a smaller, structurally coherent training dataset.\nProblem Reduction: This innovative method selectively diminishes decision variables and constraints, thereby boosting the efficiency of problem reduction.\n Data-driven Optimization: This phase utilizes subgraph clustering and active constraint updating to steer the neighborhood search and optimization processes, iteratively enhancing solutions with limited computational demands.\n\nThrough exhaustive testing against large-scale benchmark MILPs and in real-world situations, the framework has proven its effectiveness. It surpasses current methods, emphasizing considerable reductions in computational requirements and improved problem-solving abilities. Light-MILPopt stands out particularly for its performance with smaller-scale training data and optimizers, establishing a new standard for the resource-efficient tackling of extensive MILPs. The contributions of this paper are crucial, offering a methodology that not only simplifies the computational procedure but also strengthens the strategy for addressing sophisticated, large-scale MILP difficulties."

The complexity inherent in its advanced problem formulation and division techniques may hinder practical application, necessitating specialized expertise. The framework's simplification strategies in problem reduction could potentially neglect essential problem aspects, compromising solution integrity. Additionally, its heavy reliance on model-based predictions introduces risks of inaccuracies, and the lack of detailed validation experiments obscures comprehensive performance assessment. Finally, comparisons with advanced solvers appear limited to certain metrics, calling for a more exhaustive evaluation. Overall, these issues indicate the need for cautious implementation and enhanced development for broader applicability."

            "questions": {
                "value": "MILP is an NP-hard problem, and, in the worst case, finding an optimal solution in polynomial time is considered impossible (though this has not yet been proven). The No Free Lunch theorem posits that no \"universal\" supervised machine learning model or search/optimization algorithm exists that can efficiently solve every problem (theoretically, it's unfeasible). However, assuming a prior distribution of problem generation, it becomes possible to efficiently solve specific instances with an approach like the one used in this study. Nonetheless, a substantial gap exists, limiting the effectiveness of such methods. The explanation of the limitations and constraints of this method in this context is inadequate.\n\nAnswering all of the following questions in a necessary and sufficient manner would be an onerous task for the authors; therefore, please respond as comprehensively as possible at this juncture.\n\n1: Representativeness and diversity of the dataset: Is the dataset chosen for benchmarking genuinely representative of the diverse spectrum of large-scale MILPs in real-world scenarios? How does the framework handle MILPs with varying attributes or those from different industries? While problems like Set Covering, Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Independent Set, and Mixed Integer Knapsack Set are appropriate for this method's application due to their definable problem structure, its effectiveness may be restricted for more complex practical problems. Consequently, using MIPLIB (https://miplib.zib.de/), where issues are meticulously curated for MIP benchmarking, is advisable.\n\n2: Generalizability of results: Considering that Light-MILPopt trains on merely 1% of the large benchmark MILPs, how effectively does the framework generalize to unfamiliar or more intricate MILPs? Is there proof of steady performance across a broader problem set?\n\n3: Fairness and consistency of benchmarks: Were the tests executed under uniform and fair conditions for all methods? Gurobi itself has numerous parameter settings, potentially leading to disputes from Gurobi's developers' standpoint.\n\n4: Detailed comparative analysis: While the summary underscores Light-MILPopt's superior performance relative to other solvers, it doesn't delve into why specific solvers underperform. Are there fundamental inefficiencies or constraints within the baseline solvers leading to subpar outcomes?\n\n5: Robustness and Efficiency: How does Light-MILPopt manage issues of diverse sizes and complexities? Does efficiency wane as the problem's size and intricacy escalate? What are the trade-offs between computational time and solution precision?\n\n6: Solution Quality and Optimality: Light-MILPopt is said to procure better outcomes in a shorter period, but how do these solutions compare to the global optimum? Is there a compromise in solution quality, risking a mere local optimum?\n\n7: Convergence Analysis: While convergence performance is broached, are scenarios where Light-MILPopt fails to converge efficiently identified? Comprehending its conduct under unfavorable conditions is also crucial.\n\n8: Training scalability: Given the framework's high efficacy with sparse training data, has there been an exploration of how augmenting training data influences performance? Is there a threshold where the benefits diminish, or does efficiency perpetually enhance with additional data?\n\n9: Analysis of real-world applications: The study incorporates real-world instances, but is this scrutiny exhaustive? Are the distinct constraints and hurdles present in real-world scenarios considered, and how does the system accommodate them?\n\n10: In (1) on page 2, the definition is not MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming Problem) but ILP (Integer Linear Programming Problem)"

It seems that the framework has more focus on the primal side and cannot help improving dual bound. Is there a way your method can certificate optimality?\n\n5.
