                "value": "This paper argues that existing manipulations for creating physical adversarial examples are hard to be reproduced by humans (without access to an electronic device). Therefore, they propose to generate human-producible adversarial examples, which are achieved by hand drawing. Specifically, in the digital space, the adversarial examples are optimized based on gradients and genetic search within a parameter space of line-based adversarial tags. Then, humans are asked to reproduce the adversarial lines given the (printed) digital image as the reference."

The reviewer is not convinced about why \u201chuman-producible adversarial examples\u201d are desired in the first place, given that electronic devices, e.g., printers and scanners, are quite easy to get nowadays. More importantly, printed adversarial examples have been shown to be very robust in the literature and the proposed  \u201chuman-producible adversarial examples\u201d  have not saved any computational cost at all. \nFrom the perspective of the budget of the attacker vs. defender, it seems not reasonable to constrain the attacker to use only pens since the defender has the ability to use a model/camera/scanner. \nMore specifically, in this paper, the authors indeed printed out those adversarial images with lines and let humans reproduce them. In this case, why don\u2019t the authors directly use printed images as the final adversarial examples? By the way, these printed adversarial images should be compared as a baseline (non-human-producible) attack.\n\n- Lack of discussion about potential countermeasures. A clear drawback of using a simple adversarial manipulation is the lack of stealthiness. In the case of line-based adversarial tags, it seems very easy to filter out them, e.g., based on edge detection or simply prototype matching. The authors should better test these potential countermeasures because attack stealthiness is important.\n\n- As can be seen from the visualizations, the robust loss leads to lines quite close to the cup but the non-robust loss leads to lines further away. Why does it happen? If this really the case about why the robust loss works better, is it possible to just constrain the modification space to be surrounding the cup to make the attack robust? \n\n- The detailed image design was not introduced until Section 3.5 \u201cTo test this real-world scenario, we conducted an experiment whereby we took photographs of a common household object \u2013 a cup \u2013 and produced an adversarial tag for them. We constrained the search area to a rectangular bounding box to limit the lines to a specific area of the image to avoid the cup itself.\u201d However, without this introduction, it is very hard to understand the specific design depicted in Figure 2. The reviewer initially thought there was a sub-figure showing a cup pasted in the main figure showing the wall. So the suggestion is, for Figure 2, to detail those two factors independently but leave out the messages about the image design. By the way, why doesn\u2019t the black area occupy the whole image?\n\n- The use of \u201creal world\u201d/\u201cphysical world\u201d. In the experiments, the authors consider drawing lines and pasting tapes. It is better to separate these two settings using more specific terms beyond the \u201creal world\u201d/ \u201cphysical world\u201d."

The authors gradually tune the 4-tuple parameter set for each line in a collection given the gradient of the model with respect to an adversarial loss. The adversarial loss takes into account the range of intrinsic human error when drawing lines. A fixed amount of lines are pruned each iteration, iterating until the final set of adversarial lines is achieved. The authors conduct a series of experiments to check the effectiveness of the adversarial lines. A user study wih four participants was conducted to check the variance between non-robust and robust adversarial losses among users, as well as the variance among users on the same image. An experiment also measures the practical use-case of the lines, where everything except the object in focus is allowed to be modified by black tape. The experiments show that fewer long lines are more efficient for perturbation than many short lines."

It wasn't mentioned if the participants had a limited time budget to replicate the lines, which might be an important consideration in replication. \n* The evaluation only considers a single YoloV8 classifier, rather than checking on multiple architectures and robustness levels, which are valid in the author's threat model. I was expecting experiments on robustified models [1,2] or some experimental results in trying to use adversarial lines for adversarial training. It would be interesting to see if the data generated by adversarial lines is too noisy, potentially degrading the benign accuracy when used for AT. This could provide useful information for the broader community.\n* Only the white-box implementation is investigated, so the transferability of lines is unknown. It seems unlikely that a human with only a marker can also backprop through a service provider's model. I was expecting an experiment where the adversary tries to transfer adversarial lines from an owned model to an unseen model, potentially of a different architecture. The authors primarily pitch the contribution as an easily accessible technique for non-experts, so it seemed contradictory that they would also require access to weight-level knowledge of the defender's model. In the same spirit, the computational complexity seems too high for a non-expert to perform these attacks, since it requires a 4-GPU workstation to run. \n* Only 500 images from 1000-class ImageNet were investigated (i.e., only half of classes are represented), and in that regard, the authors have only performed experiments on ImageNet. It isn't clear if the proposed methodology is applicable to other datasets, or how the attack behaves across different object classes. I suspect some object classes and camera angles are more difficult to attack under this threat model. This would change the overall feasability of the attack. \n* The physical realization of attacks still seems unlikely, since most experiments allow adversarial lines to occupy any portion of the image, even the background. Previous work have successfully launched similar attacks by only perturbing the spatial region of a relevant object (e.g., clothing patch or fashion attacks). \n* It is difficult to gauge the significance of the submission without comparisons to baseline techniques. For example, it seems feasible that existing white-box attacks could be used for a similar style attack by limiting their influence to the regions with adversarial lines, and limiting the fidelity of perturbation. Likewise, it isn't clear how adversarial lines perform compared to techniques such as adversarial clothing or sunglasses. \n\n\n[1] Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing. http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918\n\n[2] Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks. http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083"
