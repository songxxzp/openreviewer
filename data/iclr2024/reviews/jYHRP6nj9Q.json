The reason why the authors choose social homophily and social contagion as the two specific conditions in this paper is not clear. The author's criteria or basis for selecting these two aspects should be introduced. No explanation of the above two concepts is not provided when they first appear.  \n3. Both social homophily and social contagion are based on the assumption of network homogeneity. However, more and more works point out the heterogeneity of real-world networks, especially in social networks (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). Therefore, it is concerning whether the assumptions on which the method is based are good for social graphs.  \n4. The scalability of the proposed method is slightly unsatisfactory. As a dual conditional method, the proposed method uses the conditions between the nodes/edges to implement two specific conditional constraints through the transfer of point and edge information. It is not explored whether the model can be applied to any two constraints and how it should be extended if both conditions are at the node level (independent of edges).  \n5. Figure 2 should be improved for more clarity with some explanations either in the figure or in the caption.  \n6. The ablation studies of each condition and loss are missing."

Existing methods, such as statistical sampling and deep generative models, have limitations in capturing dependencies across dual conditions and accounting for social homophily and social contagion phenomena in conditional social graphs. This paper introduces a novel conditional graph generative model *CDGraph*, exploiting co-evolution dependency to guide the diffusion process to capture the dependencies between the node and edge conditions, solving the problem of the limitation of social homophily and social contagion. Furthermore, the authors propose a dual conditional classifier to guide the sampling process to fulfill dual conditions while capturing the correlation between the specified conditions. The paper conducts extensive experiments on real-world networks and evaluates the performance on validity and error discrepancies of the generated graphs compared to the input graphs. Results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under different correlations among specified conditions."

What is the motivation for introducing the formulation?  \n\n- As the number of dimensions needs to be specified in the input of the diffusion reverse process, the number of nodes should be a human-specified parameter, which does not seem proper to be a metric for evaluating the performance.\n\n- The proposed method does not seem to be applicable to graphs with more than 2 conditions. However, the profiles of users in a social graph often consist of multiple properties.
