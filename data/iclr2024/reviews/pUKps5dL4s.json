Previous research has also found that representing a probability distribution as particles simplifies the computation of gradients and the resulting gradient flow algorithm. These have been presented in the literature as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) or Particle Gradient Descent (PGD).\n\nThis work seeks to accelerate the gradient step in PGD by infusing it with Nesterov momentum which is a well known technique that can be applied to any gradient descent algorithm. The authors provide the following technical contribution in this work\n1) mathematical justification for their momentum infused gradient flow in this joint space (of parameters and probability distributions).\n2) a proof of convergence of their gradient flow algorithm.\n3) a partial update discretization for faster convergence.\n\nIn addition the authors show results on two datasets. One trivial dataset which demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach by including an ablation study of the partial update. The second dataset is a more realistic problem of building a Variational Auto Encoder where the momentum method described here seems to work very effectively."

They also demonstrate that the addition of momentum is done in a theoretically sound manner, i.e. it \"reproduces the dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator\".\n\nThe authors provide a slightly improved momentum method that makes partial updates and they provide a theoretical proof of convergence. The partial update definitely appears to be original and the results on the toy dataset show that this partial update does have an impact on faster convergence.\n\nThe results on the Variational Auto Encoder suggest that their method is at least as good if not better than the nearest competing method."

However, a toy example is not sufficient to prove the value of this novelty in the paper. I would refer to the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00065, \"Gradient Descent on Neural Networks Typically Occurs at the Edge of Stability\" which shows that conclusions that are made on toy examples are quite the opposite of those in real world problems.\n\nShowing convergence is valuable, but most gradient flow algorithms have a natural recipe to provide convergence under strong convexity and/or smoothness assumptions. So, this is not really a novelty here. It does go to overall quality of the paper though.\n\nIf we were to simply add a momentum step to every paper with a gradient update algorithm and show some results where it performs better then we would have a deluge of papers! For example in the Coin EM paper there is a SVGD-like gradient step for updating the density represented by particles. Now, one could certainly add momentum to that, does that make it a novel contribution?\n\nI would readily admit that if adding momentum to an existing algorithm gives an improvement then it is worth disseminating. In my opinion though such contributions don't reach the level of originality demanded by a conference publication.\n\nMinor:\n\ntypo: Confernece on page 10 in the citation for Kuntz 2023\n\ntypo: on page 9 AGPD -> MPGD\n\nI would suggest some rearrangement to ensure that the inequalities in 35 are included in the main text."

The paper only briefly mentions using Kuntz's method in Section 5. However, it\u2019s important to note that while the proposed method is based on Underdamped dynamics, Kuntz\u2019s approach is for Overdamped scenarios. In usual Langevin dynamics, not specifically Mckean-Vlasov processes, it\u2019s well-known that not paying enough attention to time discretization in Underdamped cases can lead to unstable dynamics, which is a crucial issue for sampling. But this paper does not seem to discuss these potential problems.\n\nAdditionally, the paper does not provide enough information on how to choose parameters properly. In the field of Langevin dynamics, it\u2019s recognized that using Underdamped dynamics can lead to faster results if the parameters, like the momentum parameter, are chosen correctly.

While it is natural to consider \"momentum enriched\" optimization algorithms in this context, I am left wondering whether there is a **strong** motivation, precisely: are there problems where PGD actually **struggles**,  *and* the new MPGD (even if well-tuned) really resolves the situation ? This is not very clear from the current version of the paper. Yes, we \"can\" do this extension and it's natural, and it seems to perform better (focussing for now on the toy example, where metrics are more interpretable and relate directly to the MLE problem) than PGD, but the toy example only shows a (relatively minor) *improvement* over PGD which is already working well. Could you think of an example where the benefits of MPGD vs PGD really show, i.e., PGD is converging very slowly and MPGD \"fixes\" the problem ?  Again in other words, the authors claim \"we derive a discretization of the flow that can achieve better performance than PGD ...\", and this is supported by the experiments. It \"can be better\" indeed, but how relevant is that? It would be stronger to show cases where PGD doesn't do well and MPGD really does (as opposed to cases where they both do well and MPGD does a bit better). \n- This point is related to the above; in the toy experiment, there is not a significant (in the sense of practically, not statistically) difference between MPGD and PGD (Figs 1(a) and (b) ) except for the underdamped and overdamped regimes (which presumably are less desirable). Can you try with different parameters (e.g. variances of the hierarchical model) to see if there is a setting where MPGD really shows its strength ?"
