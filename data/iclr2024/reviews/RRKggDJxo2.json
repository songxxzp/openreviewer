Where this shows the most is in the _Methods_ section, which lacks structure, and only is tractable due to the write-up of the algorithms.\n\nSpace invested in earlier sections, is then missing in the _Experiments_, and _Results_ section. The experiments section would benefit greatly from citations to the algorithms the approach is compared to, and could be more brief. The results section suffers from a number of issues in presentation such as\n- The Eigenvalue testing being 2 pages ahead of the actual results section\n- _Table 2_, the table with the main results being too small, and unpronounced. I would urge the authors to make it more prominent by e.g. rotating it by 90 degrees, and following the ICLR table formatting guidelines.\n- The caption of Figure 6 is as is not useful, and requires a rewrite to make the results more clear, and better legible.\n\nIn addition the results section leaves a lot of questions unanswered with regards to the performance of the algorithm, further testing of which would improve the paper significantly:\n- An ablation analysis over the number of reservoirs inside of the reservoir instead of just treating it as a hyper parameter, i.e. how does the quality of the result change over the number of reservoirs?\n- Performance testing to substantiate the claim of _real-time learning_ by e.g. adding a third column to table 2 for the speed of the approach.\n- Illustrative experiments complementing the presented theoretical analysis of recursive least squares-driven loss functions would help to further substantiate this contribution of the paper, and would strengthen the draft."

Have you considered \"starving\" your algorithm (& others it is being compared to) of data to inspect their behavior?\n- What tool did you use for the search space exploration for the optimal size of the pool? If it is a commonly used hyperparameter optimization tool, I would suggest to concretize this part, and cite the respective tool.\n- Which framework, and based on which stack did you write your approach in?
