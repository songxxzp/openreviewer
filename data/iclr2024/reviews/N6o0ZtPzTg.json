To address these issues, Prompt-OIRL utilizes offline inverse reinforcement learning on existing prompting benchmark data to learn a prompt evaluation model without needing the LLM. This model can then efficiently recommend optimal prompts in a best-of-N fashion for new queries. Experiments across various LLM scales and math datasets demonstrate Prompt-OIRL's efficacy and cost-effectiveness for zero-shot prompt optimization with query dependency."

To overcome both of these challenges they propose Prompt-OIRL, an offline inverse reinforcement learning approach to learn a reward function per model and dataset, predicting the success of a  prompt query pair.

E.g. the modelling of the proxy reward is not discussed at all in the main text, with the appendix suggesting a combination of an LLM embedding of prompt and query followed by an XGBT.\n* It is unclear which single prompt was used for the scarce demonstration setting in Figure 5. Crucially, there, all baseline methods were limited to this single prompt, while Prompt-OIRL could choose any of the 6 considered prompts. Similarly, a comparison to always choosing each of the considered prompts and always choosing the best one (using an oracle) is missing but would be crucial to assessing performance\n* The failures of Prompt-OIRL (e.g. GSM8K with LLaMA or TigerBot (Figures 20 and 21)) where it performs worse amongst all considered methods by a large margin are only shown in the appendix. Ironically this section is titled \"REWARD MODELING: IMPLEMENTATION MATTERS\", suggesting it should be discussed in the main text.\n* While the use of LLMs for embedding computation of prompts is unproblematic when choosing the best-of-n (with n=6) fixed prompts, it might be prohibitively expensive for different policy optimization approaches requiring a substantially larger number of prompts to be embedded. This should be highlighted more prominently and not presented as a major advantage of this method."

Can you similarly report the performance of always choosing the best prompt for every query (corresponding to the setting where the proxy reward models the success flawlessly)?\n3) How does Prompt-OIRL differ from  BoTr Eqn.2 when trained on all considered prompts? Its description suggests that also selects the best of n prompts but it achieves worse performance in Figure 6. \n4) How does performance depend on the training data-set size given that much smaller datasets with gold-standard annotations will be available for many real-world applications?\n\n### Comments\n* The paper could benefit from a careful copywriting pass that addresses typos and grammatical errors while homogenizing the writing style.\n* Figure 7 would benefit from a relative scale, especially for the \"Cost with Commercial APIs\". It generally seems slightly misleading to report improvements when 100 Prompts are used here while the rest of the paper considers 6 prompts. Further, it remains unclear if or how the cost of embedding the prompts and evaluating the proxy reward is considered here.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe paper presents query-dependent prompt optimization as an interesting and novel approach to improving LLM performance. While multiple models and benchmarks are considered in the empirical evaluation, details remain unclear and some baselines are missing, eroding the confidence in the presented improvements. Combined with the missing details on the exact modeling of the proxy reward as well as any ablation of this key component, I am leaning toward rejecting this paper.\n\n### Post Rebuttal Update\nI have raised my score in response to the detailed rebuttal addressing my questions satisfactorily. I believe the paper could further benefit from incorporating some of these results, presented during the rebuttal."
