For example, [1], [2] deals with $64 \\times 64$ images and tackles unpaired image-to-image problems. I am not sure, if the methods from [1], [2] works with $256 \\times 256$, but, anyway, [1] and [2] should be covered as the related works and the competitive methods.\n- Regarding the competitive methods (GANs), the authors miss the StarGAN and StarGAN v2 [3]. The latter model demonstrates a good quality on the unpaired image2image and I think this model is a good baseline method. Please, add it to the comparison.\n- I have one concern about objective (14). The transition from constrained problem (9)-(10) to the combination of losses (14) is non-trivial and not fully theoretically justified. I am not sure, that the objective (14) indeed solves the SB problem. Some comments/clarifications will contribute to the clearness of the manuscript flow.\n- I ask the authors to add the clarifications how to estimate the entropy with samples, a technique introduced at the beginning of page 6. It will facilitate the comprehension and smoothness of the reading. \n- I strongly encourage the authors to evaluate how does their approach solve SB problem on a nontrivial setup beyond gaussian2gaussian case. In particular, there is a recent paper [4] which proposes benchmark pairs of distributions with known GT EOT/SB solutions, even for images data. The validation on such a benchmark will highly contribute to the quality of the paper and will probably answer the question (3).\n- I have one more question regarding the baseline methods. The authors choose the work [5] (called them as NOT) \u201cas the representative of OT [methods]\u201d. This choice really surprised me because [5] also deals with SB problem, and, as I understand, their method is not designed for image data (at least, the authors of [5] does not consider image data use cases). That is why comparing with [5] seems strange. I recommend authors take [6, 7, 8] as the representative of OT methods instead. These methods also has a possibility to generate the samples of controllable diversity, have GAN-resembling objective. Moreover, they are designed specifically for unpaired image2image problems.\n\n[1] Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge Matching, NeurIPS\u20192023\n\n[2] Entropic Neural Optimal Transport via Diffusion Processes, NeurIPS\u20192023\n\n[3] StarGAN v2: Diverse Image Synthesis for Multiple Domains, CVPR\u20192020\n\n[4] Building the Bridge of Schr\u00f6dinger: A Continuous Entropic Optimal Transport Benchmark, NeurIPS\u20192023\n\n[5] Transport with support: Data-conditional diffusion bridges, arxiv\n\n[6] Neural Optimal Transport, ICLR\u20192023\n\n[7] Neural Monge Map estimation and its applications, TMLR\n\n[8] Kernel Neural Optimal Transport, ICLR\u20192023"
