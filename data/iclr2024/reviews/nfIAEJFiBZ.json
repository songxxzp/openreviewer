                "value": "The paper is about online RL algorithm design and theoretical analysis. Different from most previous RL theory works which lack deep RL demonstrations, this work proposes a both practical (scalable to deep RL domains) and provably efficient online RL algorithm (LMC-LSVI) based on the celebrated Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm. Theoretically, it proves that with linear function approximation LMC-LSVI achieves a $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}H^{5/2}T^{1/2})$-online regret. On the practical side, LMC-LSVI is further extended to the Adam LMCDQN algorithm which performs similarly or even better than SOTA explorative deep RL algorithms in some challenging RL domains."

This work gives a possible and positive answer to this question in the specific setting of online RL where exploration-exploitation balance is a key problem. \n2. The proposed  Langevin Monte Carlo Least-Squares Value Iteration (LMC-LSVI) algorithm turns out to have a quite clean form which simply adds a noise term to the gradient descent update of the Bellman error (Line 9 of Algorithm 1) to incentivize exploration. This advantage thus allows for a deep RL extension where Adam-based adaptive SGLD is further applied.\n3. The proposed algorithm enjoys theoretical guarantees (in the linear function approximation setting) which is missing in most previous deep RL exploration methods even for LFAs."

Is this inevitable for a sampling-stype algorithm and analysis? This will narrow the applicability of the theory since for frequentist regret analysis we always hope that the regret bound can hold for arbitrarily small fail probability.\n2. The authors say in the contribution part that \"unlike any other provably efficient algorithms for linear MDPs, it can easily be extended to deep RL settings\",..., \"such unification of theory and practice is unique in the current literature of both theoretical RL and deep RL\", which to my knowledge is overclaimed. Even though the perspective of Langevin dynamic are less explored in this regime, which is done by this paper, there do exist other works trying to achieve sample efficiency while being compatible with practical deep RL methods, e.g., [1, 2, 3]. So it seems improper to describe the work as unique given this line of research.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Feng, Fei, et al. \"Provably Correct Optimization and Exploration with Non-linear Policies.\" *International Conference on Machine Learning*.

While I acknolwedge that the proposed algorithms (OPT-RLSVI and LSVI-PHE) may not perform well in practice, one could argue that they could exhibit scability with the incorporation of certain simple heuristics, even if formal guarantees are absent. Indeed, the LSVI-PHE paper includes moderate experiments. The author has similarly extended theoretically justified algorithms to practical versions without formal backing as they did. So, in this sense, I am not sure why it is reasonable to say the author's algorithm is scalable, but their algorithms are not scalable."

Is it due to any fundamental hardness in analysis or inherent to LMC algorithms or just a shortcoming of the analysis done in the paper? Can you explain this?\n4. The practical version is claimed to be better than the existing LMC algorithm for RL cause the proposal has theoretical guarantees and also employs better practical techniques.

The second is also not clear as the experimental results leave the question of performance improvement statistically inconclusive .
