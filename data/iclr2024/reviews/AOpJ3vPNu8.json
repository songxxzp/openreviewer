About the research motivation.\n\nDescriptions in page 1 \u201cHowever, optimally minimizing the individual task losses in the inner loop may not essentially lead to minimizing the average loss in the outer-loop\u2026\u201d. Based on my understanding, the goal of MAML is to find the meta initialization that minimizes the average inner task losses. So will the failure of minimizing the outer loss results in the failure of the minimizing inner losses in a theoretical sense?\nAlso, the author mentioned previous MAML cannot well handle the worst-case loss. However, I failed to see the potential of Nash-MAML in alleviating this at least in comparison to (Collins et al., 2020).\n\n2. About the order in the optimization. \n\nIt is reasonable to model the optimization with Stackelberg game. However, since the optimization is executed in a task batch way. I am afraid (i) the change of the task batch number affects the theoretical and empirical analysis (ii) the order of players results in completely different equilibrium. Though on page29, the author claims the order of players does not affect the convergence, the order defines different equilibrium. This requires more consideration particularly when the alternating gradient descent is executed in optimization.\n\n3. About evaluation. \n\nIt seems the comparison baselines are not SOTA, and the meta reinforcement learning experiments are not included."

For example, the objective of learning meta-parameters may extend beyond merely minimizing the average task loss.  However, if the authors are trying to address these problems, \nthey should provide corresponding metrics or environments in the experiments to support their claims, such as the Worst metric in [3].\n\n2) Assumption 1 seems somewhat strong and directly leads to the convergence of global Stackelberg equilibrium. However, this assumption may not always exist for neural network, and also the converged point may not always be global equilibrium point.  It would be helpful if the authors could relax this assumption and see if the proposed method can converge to a local differential Stackelberg Equilibrium [1].\n\n3) The proposed methods do not consistently outperform the baselines, such as in 5-way 1-shot FOMAML and 5-way 1-shot CAVIA. Additionally, it would be beneficial to introduce stronger and more recent MAML baselines, such as TSA-MAML [2].\n\n\n4) There are some typos and unclear parts, such as in Table 2, where it should be CAVIA rather than CAVIA (32); in section 4.1, where it should be NashMAML instead of NashMALM; and in Table 1, where Nesterov's AGD is used without reference or explanation.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Convergence of Learning Dynamics in Stackelberg Games\n\n[2] Task Similarity Aware Meta Learning: Theory-inspired Improvement on MAML\n\n[3] Task-Robust Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning"

Furthermore, if the goal of the outer-loop changes, the current inner-loop formulation, which adapts the model to individual tasks independently, does not help learn the meta-parameter.\u201d Supporting evidence(references or empirical results) for this statement will strengthen the motivation of the approach.\t\n\n- The authors motivate the approach (in the introduction) by considering the worst-case performance. The connection between this setting and the proposed approach is not very apparent (perhaps I missed something?) and curious enough the authors end-up concluding that this will be part of the future work! \n\n*Experimental weaknesses*\n- The authors claim to compare against iMAML (page 8), but Table 2 lists only FOMAML, MAML and CAVIA. What motivated the authors to drop iMAML? This is important as iMAML too has a similar objective.\n- Comparison against TR-MAML[2] is missing.\n- Experiments on a single benchmark dataset are insufficient, especially, when some of the more recent works have achieved better performance than NashMAML. For eg. TAML achieves similar results! I encourage the authors to experiment with FC100 and tieredImagenet datasets as well, if not some of the more challenging cross domain few-show setups such as Metadataset and VTAB. \n- How were the hyper-parameters $\\lambda$ and $r$ tuned?\n\n*Some minor issues:*\n- Spelling mistakes :  inne-loop problem, NashMALM (page 5) \n- Grammar issues: Which-decision maker who determines, M player - players\n- Space issues: Space between arg and max in equations 2, 3 etc\n- PRGD used before expanding it.\t\n\n[1] Jamal, M.
