This line of experiments is well explained and rigorously reported. The use of the PDE-Bench dataset tasks and baseline models will ease all future work of the community to build and improve on the proposed approach. \n\nStrength 2: The architecture is novel and constitutes a first usage of transformer-based architectures for autoregressive modeling of physics systems. Given the exceptional scaling abilities of these models and their results in other scientific domains (chemical physics, biology), it is a promising direction for autoregressive tasks. Reporting the performance of the proposed architecture on PDEBench tasks, without multi-physics training, would already be valuable to the community. \n\nStrength 3 : The paper is easy to read and the questions it aims at answering are clearly formulated. Design choices and training regime are well motivated by the specificities of multi-systems learning, and clearly documented. This will ease the ramp-up of the community on pre-training tasks, and improve on the proposed architectures by proposing alternate design choices.\n\nStrength 4 : Figures and tables are clear, metrics and units are clearly reported and consistent with previous publications when taken from there"

Their experimental results indeed support the claim that MMP is superior. However I believe that in order to develop useful foundation models, such models should be compared to the \u201cbest one can do\u201d task-specific model in the low-data settings. Monitoring the progress on tasks that are too hard for task-specific baselines (like those implemented in the PDEBench paper) will provide rich insights to the community. The first line of experiments (Section 5.1) does not enable this, as all tasks are used at training time, including the test task. \nA possible experiment to add to section 5.2 would consist in training one of the PDEBench baseline models on the two low-data tasks\n\nWeakness 2: The model architecture is completely novel and more experimental validation should be done to maximize the value for the community. Specifically, to separate the added-value of the transformer architecture from the added value of the multi-systems training, it could have been interesting to train the MMP architecture on each of the PDEBench tasks individually, and include it in Table 1 as a new single-task baseline. It is also quite common to include ablation studies to validate intuitions or design choices, and the claim that positional encodings help to learn boundary conditions (Section 4.2, last paragraph) should be validated either by such experiment, or by a proof in the supplementary material. \n\nWeakness 3: The conclusion reminds the motivation behind multi-systems pretraining, but does not clearly recapitulate which questions have been answered and what is left to future studies. The two paragraphs are not well articulated and I feel would benefit from a rework. Ideally the reader should finish the paper with a clear view of the unanswered questions or limitations to be addressed."

Ideally, report the performance of one task-specific baseline in Figure 5. \n\n2) Rework the conclusion to simply recapitulate the questions answered and which questions should be explored in future studies.\n\n3) In section 4.2 last paragraph, clarify whether the claim on boundary conditions is justified theoretically, validated by an ablation study, or both. Ideally, add relevant information in the supplementary material.\n\nMinor comments to improve readability :\n\na) Code clarity : Papers that propose pretrained models should be as easy as possible to finetune, so that the community can make quick progress towards more efficient pretraining approaches on challenging downstream tasks. I would recommend rewriting the train.py file to remove a lot of boilerplate code and make it easier to reuse and tweak. \n\nb) Clarity of Figure 2 and its legend can be improved: ReVIN abbreviation for the normalization layer is not defined. \u201cphysics metadata\u201d is not defined neither in text nor in figure legend. \n\nc) Table 1 : abbreviations for task names are not defined in the manuscript and make it hard to find the correspondence in the initial PDEBench paper. Please define these abbreviations in the table legend.  \n\nd) There is a typo in section 5.1 (word \u201call\u201d written twice) : our models (denoted by MPP-AViT-*) must handle all all systems and regimes without finetuning"

Overall, the idea is novel, paving a new path for the application of neural operators in data-constrained scenarios. However, the learning of neural operators significantly differs from other data types like text and images, and whether a simple auto-regressive approach can be used for unified pre-training remains ambiguously addressed in the paper. Detailed concerns are noted in the drawbacks. All in all, I appreciate the idea presented in this paper, yet there is considerable room for improvement in problem definition, paper composition, experimental design, and comparisons.

The experimental results validate that even with differences in equation parameters or properties, pre-training can significantly save data, which is a valuable point.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Firstly, the paper forcibly combines different types of datasets for training without considering the potential conflicts in PDE solutions. For instance, one can construct two PDEs that have identical or minimally differing data within a certain frame count, yet due to the non-linearity of PDEs or inherent differences in the equations, they exhibit substantial differences in subsequent evolution. Unlike Ref [1] which unifies the form of PDEs, this paper's approach to mixed dataset training could lead to the model learning meaningless representations, especially in the presence of conflicting data. From the experiments and provided open-source code, it seems the paper selected equations with vastly different properties for pre-training, which doesn't address this challenge faced in PDE pre-training.\n\n2. Although the experimental section is logically well-structured, the descriptions of the experimental results and settings remain unclear. For example, PDEBench provides multiple datasets for CNS M1.0 and CNS M0.1, but the paper doesn't clearly state which dataset was used for training or testing. Besides, the source of the results for other baselines is not clarified, and the comparisons have too few baselines.\n\n3. I believe the paper's contribution of pre-training PDE representations is overstated. Upon careful examination of the appendices, I found that the paper nearly only utilized a few fluid dynamics datasets from PDEBench and a small diffusion-reaction equation dataset. Compared to the NLP or CV community, which employs almost all publicly available data on the internet for pre-training, the scale of pre-training in this paper is not large; it's more aptly termed as transfer learning.\n\nReferences\n1.

                "value": "This paper introduces a multiple physics pretraining approach for surrogate modeling, which learns general useful features across diverse physical tasks with a shared embedding and normalization strategy. The experiment results show the proposed MPP-pretrained model outperforms task-specific baselines on all pretraining sub-tasks and also show superior finetuning results on new physics tasks."

The experiments demonstrate impressive results in both pretraining sub-tasks as well as substantial transfer potential for new tasks with low-data system.\n3. The authors have conducted several training strategies to perform the pretraining effectively."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. More attempts can be made to address the transferability problems between different types of physics equations. For instance, when discussing the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, whether at high or low Reynolds numbers, the equation forms are quite similar, which allows for the investigation into whether a single model still possesses robust merged learning capabilities for more different classes of equations, such as diffusion equations and wave equations.\n\n2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this new approach compared to the Finite Element Method (FEM) for systems with explicit control equations or empirical formulas? One of my biggest problem is whether the physics task should be treated as a purely data-driven problem, or if it ought to incorporate certain explicit priors or equation-based guidelines.\n\n3. For models without PDEs, how can we determine the similarity of multiple physics fields and whether they can be learned simultaneously? I\u2019m concerned about the improved performances are due to the limited diversity of different physics tasks.\n\n4. In the appendix, experimental data from 1-step to 9-step show little change in the field, whether looking at ground truth or predicted solutions. If the selected time steps were longer, would the model still be able to accurately predict future changes?"
