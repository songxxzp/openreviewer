                "value": "**Main arguments**\n\n1. The shape of Pareto fronts between accuracy and fairness is largely dependent on the model architectures and fairness metrics. Many research could be found in the literature that focuses on capturing the trade-off curve for different ML models. Ignoring imprecise presentation of Theorem 1-2, Theorem 1, and Proposition 1 convey a trivial argument that if optimizers for different sensitive groups are aligned, there is no conflict between fairness and accuracy. I cannot see enough novelty from there.\n2. Theorem 2: if $T_\\Theta^f$ is the optimal classifier for fairness, it corresponds to an extreme point on the global Pareto front with the lowest accuracy. I don\u2019t see the possibility of the case where accuracy of  $T^*_a$ is lower than that of the optimal classifier for fairness. \n3. The statement of eliminating trade-offs is not rigorous. Also the authors didn\u2019t give an actionable solution for aligning decision boundaries across different groups. Since the same accuracy classifier means the same decision boundary, can we just use the same classifier for different groups? In Proposition 1, the author basically formalized or rephrased when the accuracy-fairness conflict doesn\u2019t exist.  When the decision boundaries are identical across different groups, it means the sensitive attribute distributions are unbiased across positive and negative groups. If the distributions across different groups are biased, is it still possible to align decision boundaries with a separate classifier for each group? It is highly doubted. \n4. Section 6.1 and 6.2: using the same setting, it is not clear to the readers how the two different shapes of the Pareto front in Figure 2 and Figure 4 were obtained. \n5. Section 6.4: Example 4 in Figure 6, where is the claim \u201cmaximum accuracy becomes unattainable\u201d based on? Again, the elimination of the accuracy-fairness trade-off doesn\u2019t come from any changes in model architectures but comes from the natural optimization over accuracy. The example in Figure 7 seeing the same fairness and accuracy optimizer is due to the unbiased distribution of sensitive attributes across positive and negative groups. \n\n**The paper has many imprecise parts, here are a few:**\n\n1. Theorem 1 equation (7): Based on my understanding, it means the two groups are not discriminative at all. \n2. Theorem 1 Condition 2: arithmetic operation over probability distribution function f(**) makes no sense.* f(*) is more like a mean function of nonsensitive feature vector, which limits the generality of the derived theory to any data distribution. \n3. Theorem 1 P5 Condition 1: the equality between the 2nd and 3rd terms means basically the sensitive feature is completely aligned with target labels? In addition to (7), the theorem tried to convey that we can find a unique optimizer for both accuracy and fairness with completely random data samples from independent uniform distributions (for A and Y). I don\u2019t see much useful insight from this theorem. \n4. P6 second paragraph \u201ca basic assumption in prior fair ML research that the loss function is convex\u201d: the non-convexity of the Pareto front between accuracy and fairness doesn\u2019t necessarily mean non-convexity of loss functions. The loss function is an estimation of accuracy and could be convex or non-convex depending on the ML models, while accuracy is a discrete measure. \n5. P6 equation (12) what is the definition of $TPR^*$  and how it is computed are not clear. \n6. Section 5 P7 the claim about how to tackle data unfairness doesn\u2019t completely capture the root causes of data fairness. Other than data imbalance, there is inherent data bias from biased ground truth labels. There are a bunch of pre-processing based fair ML methods where the ground truth labels were re-labeled to reduce data bias. \n\n**Things to improve the paper that did not impact the score:**\n\n1. section 2 on p2 Notation: $\\Theta$ in $T_{\\Theta}$  is not introduced before use.\n2. section 2 on p3 \u201cFairFrontier is monotonically non-increasing\u201d is misleading when describing a curve of two dimensions. From the point of view of accuracy, it is non-increasing, while in terms of fairness, it is non-decreasing. And the monotonicity is self-explained by the definition of Pareto fronts.  \n3. Figure 4 y axis label needs to be fixed.\n4. P5 Section 4.2 second paragraph: \u201c\u2026the sign of the predictions is the same as that of the optimal classifier used for each group\u201d \u2192 the optimal classifier for the whole dataset? \n5. Figures 6-7 captions are misleading: both figures are demonstration for Example 4."

                "value": "The paper attempts to provide a theoretical characterization of the fairness and accuracy trade-off in a binary classification setting.  The authors claim the following contributions. 1) When non-sensitive features fully encode the sensitive features, the paper proves that the Pareto frontier graph is continuous in the fairness parameter. 2) When non-sensitive features do not fully encode sensitive features, the Pareto frontier may be discontinuous in the accuracy parameter. and 3) Authors claim that by decomposing the unfairness in data and model unfairness one can eliminate the fairness and accuracy trade-off."

The approach that looks at the fairness/accuracy trade-off in the light of how closely non-sensitive attributes encode the sensitive attributes has some potential and is worth pursuing in my opinion. Having said that, the paper lacks rigour and clarity. See the weaknesses for detailed comments."

                "value": "The paper can be improved significantly in both the technical content and writing. \n\n1. The authors claim in the abstract that they demonstrate that the trade-off exists in real-world settings. However, they do not consider any real-world example or experiment in the paper. \n2. Many terms in the paper are used without rigorously defining them. For instance, what do you mean by over-pursuing fairness? what are mostly continuous functions? \n3. Definition 1 says that the well-defined classifier must agree with optimal classifiers for both groups on the set over which they agree with each other; even if they are inaccurate. I do not think this is a practical assumption. \n4.  Many claims in the paper are not substantiated. For instance, the authors say in the first line of Section 3 that the Pareto frontier is convex without proving or referring to any work in literature. They contradict themselves in the adjoining figure by plotting a concave Pareto frontier.\n5. The proofs in the paper are handwavy at best. For instance, the proof of Lemma 1 is sloppy. Though I am taking the example of Lemma 1,  other proofs also lack significantly in rigour. \n- No points  M, A and B in Figure 9. \n- Why define B if you are not using it in the proof? \n- What do you mean by sharp decline? A rigorous mathematical term should be used in formal proofs. \n- I am quite certain that $\\Omega$ is not a probability space. If it is, what is the outcome space, probability measure and signa-algebra that defines this space? Also, it is not at all clear why $x$ lies in this space.  Isn't $\\Omega$ a feature space?\n6. Theorem 1 seems a straightforward consequence of the result by Alexandra Chouldechova from the paper titled \" Fair prediction with disparate impact: A study of bias in recidivism prediction instruments\" (also see, Inherent Trade-Offs in the Fair Determination of Risk Scores, Kleinberg et.al)"
