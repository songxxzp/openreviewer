Note that the paper does not introduce a conceptually novel way to perform attacks, which would provide important information to the public. Instead, it offers a highly optimized approach that exploits several, rather standard, techniques. For this reason, I am not convinced that a paper like this has a place in a machine learning conference.\n\nI do appreciate the technical skills shown by the authors, I think that equal effort should be spent in considering the societal implications and in discussing possible defense strategies.\n\nApart from ethical consideration, I find the domain of application to be rather narrow and more suitable for a more specialized venue.

This is not a fair assumption in my opinion. While the Authors do argue that the attacker can \"leverage a pre trained StyleGAN network available on the Internet\", it is a weak argument. How would the attacker know which dataset is ``similar\" to the one used in the predictor? More grounding is needed in this respect, seems too handwavy currently.  \n\n2. Adding to the above point, the proposed method imposes an additional space constraint, in terms of the large stylegan that is to be trained. \n\n3. Given the above two points, I do not see the comparisons to be fair as the proposed method has the luxury of using an additional full-blow generator network which the previous methods don't have. Therefore, I recommend that the Authors have to try modifying the other methods while they have access to a generator, albeit on a surrogate dataset.\n\n4. The method seems very stylegan specific. Can a different GAN architecture be used? I am asking specifically because, in my experience, the latent spaces of other GANs are not as versatile as that of StyleGAN. \n\n5. The description of the method has to be more formal. For instance, before Eq. 2, it is said that there is a loss function that is getting minimized. The optimization problem has to be stated neatly (using formal math). \n\n6. A lot of mathematical details are missing - What is the expectation over, in Eq. 2 and 3? As I understand, they both are over two different distributions but are not mentioned. \n\n7. While the Authors show a few images when there is a distributional shift between the surrogate model and the predictor, it is very minor and insignificant in my opinion. Both the datasets are facial images. What happens if you take a stylegan trained on cars dataset and use it for a predictor trained on human faces?\n\nOverall, while the method is interesting, I have reservations about recommending it for acceptance given my concerns above. I shall wait to see other reviewers' comments and discussions with authors before making up my mind. Right now, I am leaning towards rejecting it."

The goal of a MI attack is to successfully reconstruct the input image to a classifier, based only on the predictions from it, as a result of which, MI can be used to recover samples from the training dataset, leaking potentially sensitive information (personal details, health scans, face images etc.). Developing better MI attacks are useful so they can be defended against more effectively for sensitive applications. \n\nWhile there has been significant progress in white-box MI attacks, black box methods still have a way to go because they are harder, and typically require several hundreds of thousands of queries for any reasonable inversion. Further, some existing methods tend to produce generic class-representative images, at the cost of intra-class differences, which undermines the goal of reproducing privacy preserving attacks. \n\nThis paper presents a _Targeted Model Inversion (TMI)_  attack, that modifies StyleGAN's latent mapper ($g: \\mathcal{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{W}$), that goes from a random prior distribution (like Gaussian) to the W space of StyleGAN. The modified mapper, $m( . )$ directly predicts the $w \\in \\mathcal{W}$, which is then passed to the generator to obtain the image; this is trained by optimizing in the W space. A surrogate model, $f'$ is obtained by fine-tuning adapting the pre-trained discriminator to mimic the original model, while the images are sampled from the pre-trained StyleGAN."

The evaluations, and experiments -- while impressive are of less impactful in my opinion. \n* Two potential mitigation strategies come to mind -- (a) in order to work with more SoTA foundation models like StyleGAN-XL, the current approach will require to work with conditional generative models, which can make it much more potent and realistic; or (b) Leverage stronger inversion techniques on _unconditional_ StyleGAN that are able to invert arbitrary OOD images using pre-trained styleGAN as well -- for example \n\t* GAN inversion for out-of-range images with geometric transformations, CVPR'21\n\t* Image2stylegan++: How to edit the embedded images?, CVPR'21\n\t* Improved StyleGAN-v2 based Inversion for Out-of-Distribution Images, ICML'22\n* The examples of images that are \"significant\" deviation from the original dataset, unfortunately are not that OOD.
