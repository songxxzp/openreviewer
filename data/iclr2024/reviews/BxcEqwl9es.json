In contrast to previous approaches that rely on the entire protein backbone, this work introduces three key contributions. First, it employs a generative flow network to generate each amino acid based solely on the local environment information of its intended structural placement. During inference, their model only requires one step of integration resulting in a significant speed improvement. Additionally, through data augmentation, the model demonstrates the ability to provide a more diverse set of sequences compared to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the paper showcases the unique capability of their generative flow network to perform zero-shot single-point mutation fitness prediction, a feat not easily achievable with other methods"
