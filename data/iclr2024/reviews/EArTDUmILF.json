                "value": "Exploiting the correlation of multimodal physiological signals to address individual differences in cross-subject emotion recognition is a simple but often overlooked detail in the past. Multimodal data has been shown to provide more information compared to single modalities, and making full use of multimodal data can improve model performance. In other words, it is a common approach to utilise the complementary of multimodal data for feature fusion to generate better feature representations. However, VBH-GNN adopts a different perspective, i.e., exploiting the relationship between multimodal data to solve the problem of individualised differences. This is like in NLP, different languages may be completely different in pronunciation and writing, but there must be similar correlations in semantic structure. This multimodal relationship will be better represented in the field of physiology, because various physiological signals correspond to the physiological system interactions of the human body. In the final experimental section (4.6) the authors also provide a good demonstration of the hypothesis that there is cross-subject similarity in the inter-signal relationships, despite individual differences in signals.\n\nDomain alignment via heterogeneous graph edge distributions is a novel idea in the field of BCI.DA has been used relatively rarely in EEG tasks, but most of the concerns are about finding domain invariant features. These features are often signal-level features. The authors argue that domain invariant features tend to trap the model in sub-optimal solutions due to individual differences in physiological signals. Therefore VBH-GNN looks for domain-invariant distributions (although in a sense the spatio-temporal relationship distribution is also a signal feature, I think there is a difference between the feature representation and the distribution), which has not been seen in previous EEG tasks.\n\nBayesian graph inference (BGI) is a generalised method. It implements a distribution with infinite parameter n in a neural network by an ingenious method and backpropagation of this infinite parameter n in network by an upper bound. It provides a feasible method to implement infinite parameters in neural networks as well as to perform backpropagation."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The explanation of the (Emotional graph transform) EGT step lacks depth. Although the authors demonstrate in their experiment (4.5) the difference between EGT and BGI, which is able to transform an intermodal heterogeneous graph into a more emotion-specific graph, the motivation for this step is not clear enough to me, and it seems more like a step based on experimental attempts to determine what to do; in other words, the authors seem to know what has to be done and how it should be done, but are unable to explain why it allows HetG to be transformed in an emotionally weighted way. what has to be done and how it should be done, but are unable to explain why doing so allows HetG to undergo an emotionally relevant weighting transformation. I think it should be that EGT creates an Attention-like effect between the original input and the HetG weights, and in training this ATTENTION tends to notice the HetG edges that are more emotionally relevant. I think the authors should experimentally demonstrate what makes EGT work and provide a more direct explanation in the paper.\n\nLack of a flowchart of the overall model. This paper contains a large number of formulas that are difficult to read, and coupled with the lack of a flowchart of the overarching model, I had a hard time imagining what the complete model would look like, how the temporal and spatial RDA components would be linked, and how the heterogeneous edges would be generated. Although the authors used formulas to explain the steps, this piling up of formulas in the presence of a large number of formulas rather made it difficult for me to understand the framework of the model, at least for me I would have liked a clearer flowchart as a guide.\n\nThe choice of Baseline is rather narrow. Although several baselines are included, they are basically methods in the BCI area. There are many DA methods in other fields, such as Maximum Classifier Discrepancy proposed in CVPR and a series of methods derived from it. I think adding more diversity of DA methods to compare and analyse can make the results more convincing, as DA is a relatively uncommon method in the BCI domain. Because multimodal data in other area do not necessarily correlate across subject as well as physiological signals, so comparison with methods in other area can demonstrate the applicability of VBH-GNN in the field of physiological signals."
