                "value": "The main review will take place in this section owing to the flow in which the review was conducted.\n\n### Abstract\n\n- The first sentence is interesting and whilst I know this is the abstract, it would be helpful to know _why_ the author(s) think it is critical challenge to understand the causal effect in networked data - who cares and why?\n\n\n### Introduction\n\n- What do you mean by \"the endogeneity\"  - this is a fairly non-standard way to use that way (at least to this reviewer, hence please do tell your usage of the term)\n- \"identifying causal effects is particularly challenging on a network of units with non-trivial dependencies\" - why is this? What gives rise to the difficulty?\n- A graphic may be helpful at the end of page one to illustrate the concepts that you discuss (e.g. graph curvature) for readers less familiar with this topic.\n\n\n### CAUSALITY, INVARIANCE, AND ROBUSTNESS\n\n- What is meant by \"unit\" in the first sentence of this paragraph?\n- Do you assume the presence of unobserved confounders? If so, please spell that out.\n- Why is your outcome denoted $\\mathbf{Y}$? That gives the impression that you are dealing with a multi-objective (more than one outcome) setting - are you? Perhaps best to spell out the domain of the features and the outcome(s) either way to avoid any confusion.\n- I find definition 2 and the paragraph following, very vague and ambiguous. It is not clear what you are describing. What is $\\mathbf{C}$? The way the bottom part of page 3 is phrased, make it difficult for a reader to extract meaning from a language that is rather too formal (without providing all the background, since that, I assume, lives in (Buhlmann, 2020)).\n- Whilst I appreciate that (Rothenhausler et al., 2021) uses the term \"anchor\" for a very common graph concept, it may be better to stick with the common tongue when it comes to graph formalism, where $A$ in figure 1 is either a leaf node or a root node depending on the perspective of the modeller. These terms predate the former's by a few decades and so may make this part of the section of the paper a bit more accessible by using the more common nomenclature. \n- You should adopt the standard graphical norms when it comes to causal inference. If H is a hidden confounder then it is standard to dash the edges (H,X) and (H,Y). The way you have drawn figure 1 makes it appear as if H is observed.\n- H is hidden (latent or unobserved) yet you are including it in equation 2? Please explain how that works.\n- You use 'source' and 'anchor' to refer to variable $A$ but never the standard 'root/leaf'? Consider picking one of these four terms.\n\n### CURVATURE, ROBUSTNESS, AND ENTROPY\n\n- The start of section 3 could do with an illustration of the concepts involved with Ricci curvature (e.g. figure four from the top: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334371953_Community_Detection_on_Networks_with_Ricci_Flow/figures?lo=1)\n- Use $S(\\cdot)$ and not $S(.)$ for the Boltzmann entropy.\n\n### Entropic causal inference\n\n- Move the review of entropic causal inference to the preliminaries - the introduction of it the way you have done it now, breaks the flow of the paper.\n- This does make any sense: $Y = f(X,E)$ - what is $f$? What is $X$ the same as before? What is $E$ noise terms? What is the causal modelling framework you are using? Is $f$ an SEM? You seem to suggest that $E$ are exogenous variables which d-separeted (?) I assume that's what your symbol means since you haven't defined it, from the outcome variable $Y$ but then you introduce something you call 'alternative exogenous variables' - what's that?\n- Equation 9 presently does not point toward anything since it is not clear how the connection is made between it and what you say it is pointing to, which is not clear since section four is lacking a lot of detail for this to be a convincing argument.\n- What I find curious further about this section if that if equation 9 is a powerful result you build on, it would be helpful if you placed it in a lemme/theorem/proposition to indicate its importance to the paper.\n\n### Curvature and causal inference\n\n- Paragraph 2 in this section could use a figure for your stated causal relationship.\n- This may be a very silly question but you say: \"we expect a higher entropy of the exogenous variables when the curvature is larger\" - how can you expect anything at all about the exogenous variables since you cannot measure them? They are latent and so unknown to the modeller. Hence, what use is theorem 2 (being the devil's advocate here)\n- Suggestion: place this within a remark: \"This ultimately suggests that more positive Ricci curvatures are expected to correspond to lower errors in estimating the causal effect\"\n\n### RELATED WORK\n\n- What are you evaluation metrics actually measuring w.r.t. your contribution in this paper? What is the relation to Ricci curvature w.r.t. these metrics?\n- To confirm, none of your networks have unobserved confounders?"

This complexity may limit its applicability to real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. How do the authors justify the complexity and computational costs?\n- How interpretable are the results? What is behind the improved estimations (beyond statistical metrics)? \n- Ricci flow adjustments' effectiveness varies based on the unique structure of real-world networks, which are diverse and dynamic. Generalizing this method across different scenarios is challenging due to the complex nature of network connections. Moreover, the method's reliance on parameters like edge weights and curvature values makes it highly sensitive to even minor fluctuations. Selecting appropriate parameter values demands careful tuning and a deep understanding of the network, posing significant challenges in achieving optimal performance.

It seems that the background is discussed too much (until page 5) and the main entree is too short (only one page), which possibly indicates that this work relies a lot on previous work. Further, the large body of discussion triggers confusion, I would expect a clear logical argument, for example, the causal model has some property, leads to robustness, further goes to entropy, and lands in Ricci curvature. The above may be wrong, but readers need the correct version instead of a stack of notions.\n\n2. As for the proposed method integrating ricci flow and GNN, I could not find anything else except one paragraph in section 5.1. So if I am not misunderstanding, the proposed algorithm is: First run Ricci flow and attain the edge weights, then use existing frameworks of GNN-based causal inference. This is OK but the contribution is quite limited. Have the authors think about how to further take advantage of this property and design new GNN frameworks? Such as [1] and many others. Further, it would be good to at least present the pseudo code/descriptions by steps of the proposed method.\n\n[1] Curvature Graph Networks."

Could you explain what are the roles of system robustness and distributional robustness in the causal model? (Especially the risk minimization). In section 3.2 you said \"we utilize the correlation between Boltzmann entropy and Ricci curvature to formally establish this anticipated connection\" but later in section 4, Shannon entropy is discussed and Theorem 2 also uses Shannon entropy. This is confusing, could you please make it clear?\n\n2. I am fine with the most proof of Theorem 3.2 but not the second assumption. If I understand correctly, $X$ is the feature and $Y$ is the label, then the difference of two datasets may not just lie on the features. I wonder if the assumption that $H(Y|X;E)$ remains similar is OK in a causality task, but nothing more.\n\n3. What does it mean by a \"wrong causal model\"?\n\n4. This is not a major issue, but have you experienced computational issues when the networks are large? The computation of ricci flow takes $\\tilde{O}(mn^3)$ if I remember correctly, which can be larger than the time for GNN. Then if we think about applications, this is a hurdle."
