Doesn't the MultiReAct that use a fully trained Cliport policy? if so, the trained policy has already been trained with the gt reward, hence, has been given more information than Cliport (data it had access to during pretraining, as well as additional pretraiend models). If this is the case, then the expectation is that MultiReAct should significantly surpass Cliport. I think a detailed breakdown between the two models are needed to clarify the benefits of MultiReAct.\n\n-   Providing information on the model's architecture with notations on which parts are finetuned and with what data, and which parts are frozen, will add more clarity. At the moment this information is scattered across the paper and hard for the reader to get the bigger picture. To my understanding, the only finetuned part is the VLM, finetuned on the dataset introduced in Section 3.3. \n\n**presentation errors**\n- In Table 1, MultiReAct (Cap) for Tower of Hanoi has SR of 90 but in text in Section 4.2 it has been stated 99.0.\n- The y-axis in Figure 3 is labeled as Performance, without mentioning what that is. SInce two measures of evaluation have been introduced (SR and Cliport reward), I assume that refers to Cliport reward? If so, why in the text in Section 4.3 while referring to Figure 3, numbers for Clip Reward are stated and not Cliport reward?  \n\n\n**validity of empirical results**\nthere seems to be no repetition with various random seeds to measure variation across different runs, also no significance test as well as no use of more recent measures such as IQM[1] were used to validate the reported results are statistically meaningful. Please provide either significant tests or use IGM.\n\n**limitation of empirical evidence**\nThe framework has been presented as a generalist approach to embodied AI. While there are many available benchmarks for Embodied AI such as Habitat, MineDojo, etc, this paper can be strengthened by extending empirical evidence to such environments, or rephrase statements to match the level of generality that the empirical evaluations can support.\n\n[1] Agarwal, Rishabh, et al. \"Deep reinforcement learning at the edge of the statistical precipice.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 34 (2021): 29304-29320."

The authors evaluate their framework only on the CLIPort tasks, which are relatively simple (e.g., the suction-based gripper abstracts away most of the low-level actions). Tasks involving more low-level controls (e.g., object manipulations) should be evaluated or at least discussed, where whether the CLIP or any existing 2D-based VLM is good enough for providing useful reward signals remains a question. For instance, the CALVIN benchmark. Alternatively, other popular embodied agent planning tasks involving only high-level actions such as ALFRED should be evaluated or at least discussed to give a better sense of the applicability of this framework.\n\n[1] Zero-Shot Reward Specification via Grounded Natural Language"

A large language model for orchestrating the video captioning model and 3. A CLIP-based discriminator for evaluation of sub-task progress.\n\nConcretely, the VLM is fine-tuned with LoRA on a dataset of demonstrations containing the long-horizon instruction, sub-instructions, and demonstrated image observations.\n\nThe CLIP-based reward function (discriminator) takes in an image observation, a positive proposition, and a negative proposition. It compares the similarity score to determine whether the current observation has completed a particular sub-instruction. Note that here the positive and negative propositions are generated by the LLM.\n\nFinally, the LLM is provided access to trainer VLM and actor modules. It is instructed to parse the visual demonstration into textual sub-instructions and then execute them sequentially. The CLIP-based discriminator provides the signal for the LLM to determine whether the actor has finished the current sub-instruction and can proceed to the next one.\n\nThe authors experimented with CLIPort and Code-as-Policy actors on a suite of short and long-horizon tasks. The results of CLIPort-based methods show that the MultiReAct performs similarly to CLIPort although it doesn't have access to the ground-truth reward signals. Further ablation studies also prove the utility of the CLIP-based reward. Results on Cap-based methods show that MultiReAct combined with Cap enables successful learning of long-horizon tasks."
