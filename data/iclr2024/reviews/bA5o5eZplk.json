                "value": "The paper investigates the problem of graph anomaly detection in a semi-supervised setting where anomalous nodes tend to differ from their neighbors in terms of the distribution of node features (not structural differences). Under the assumption that the mean attribute values are the same across anomalous and non-anomalous nodes, the authors prove that in a step-wise diffusion process that adds incremental noise to the attribute matrix X, the egonet dissimilarity $\\Omega = LX$ for nodes that have higher variance attributes will change more drastically than for those which have lower variance. Based on this observation, the authors propose (non-GNN) neural models that learn from the sequence of egonet dissimilarities to detect anomalies. Moreover, they prove that the relative accumulated energy present in low frequency signals decreases as X gets increasingly corrupted. In light of this observation, they propose a denoising network that utilizes one GCN (low-pass filter) per step. This allows them to generate additional attribute vectors for each node based on their fully-corrupted counterparts. The proposed model, DiffAD, is evaluated on six datasets w.r.t. Macro-F1 and AUC and compared with four graph anomaly detection baselines. In another set of experiments, they show that the generated attribute matrices X bring the performance of GraphSAGE very close to that of DiffAD."

However, it raises concerns about the representativeness of such anomalies in real-world diverse datasets. This could limit the applicability of the proposed approach. To address this, expanding the experimental evaluation to real datasets[1] would enhance the paper's contributions.\n\n2.  While it is intuitive that adding noise would lead to a rapid drop in egonet dissimilarity for anomalies, it raises questions about whether complex methods in Approach I are necessary for anomaly detection. At the initial stages, the egonet dissimilarity of anomalies significantly outweighs that of normal instances as illustrated in Fig.2. Therefore, it's worth considering if exploiting this difference directly could lead to more efficient detection.\n\n3.  The experimental results in Table 1 highlight that Propositions 1-based methods (FSC, TRC) often fail to outperform baseline approaches on multiple datasets. This further emphasizes the need to scrutinize the necessity and validity of Approach I.\n\n4.  Concerning loss function (Eq. 22), it's vital to ensure that the nodes in the graph $G_a$ generated using denoising techniques align with the class of the original graph $G$. Any inconsistencies could lead to conflicting optimization. Specifically, for an anomaly $v_i$ in graph $G$, how to ensure the generated corresponding node $v_i$ in $G_a$ is also an anomaly?\n\n5.  Although unsupervised methods cannot make use of label information, many of them [2][3] also leverage local inconsistencies for anomaly detection. Providing a comparative analysis against these existing methods would help establish DIFFAD's superiority effectively.\n\n6. The proposed method looks a bit complicated and it would be nice to have comparisons in terms of complexity and computational efficiency.\n\n\n[1] GADBench: Revisiting and Benchmarking Supervised Graph Anomaly Detection(arxiv, 2023)\n\n[2] Anomaly detection on attributed networks via contrastive self-supervised learning(, 2021)\n\n[3] Reconstruction Enhanced Multi-View Contrastive Learning for Anomaly Detection on Attributed Networks (IJCAI 2022)"

The authors made two observations that may help design new algorithms for supervised/semi-supervised anomaly detection. The first observation leads to algorithms that are capable of capturing local information in egonet. The second observation leads to the generation of additional graphs based on the diffusion process that can be utilized as auxiliary data to enhance the anomaly detectors. The authors then demonstrate the benefit of the models compared with baselines on several public datasets."

                "value": "I have a few concerns and questions regarding the paper:\n1) One of my biggest concerns about this paper is its clarity of presentation. The paper is hard to understand. One factor is that the authors did not describe enough about how the diffusion process works on graphs. Section 3.2 only explains the generic diffusion process on regular data (x). How it applies in the context of graphs, which contain structure and attributes, is not clearly explained. After explaining Section 3.2, the authors directly jump to the graph observations without explaining how the diffusion process on graphs works.\n2) Since the authors did not clearly explain the diffusion process on graphs, many questions may arise about this, such as:\n    - How does the structure of the graph (A) contribute to the next node feature representation (X_{t+1})?\n    - Any effect of the neighboring node on a particular node representation in the next step?\n    - The diffusion process itself tries to model the data distribution, i.e., for graph cases, it models the data distribution of G={A, X}. As the first approach utilizes the diffusion information, why do the authors claim that the approach does not need to learn P(A, X)?\n    - And more questions that depend on the answer to the questions above.\n3) The principle derived from the first observation is not surprising, i.e., \"The denoising neural network should be capable of capturing the local information in egonets\". In fact, I would argue that this principle is the bedrock of nearly all graph anomaly detection models.  \n4) The baselines used in the experiments are relatively inadequate, particularly in the second group. I would suggest the authors to add more baselines in the comparisons, such as:\n    - GHRN [1]\n    - GDN [2]\n    - H2-FDetector [3]\n    - GAGA [4]\n    - etc.\n\n\n[1] Yuan Gao, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He, Zhenguang Liu, Huamin Feng, and Yongdong Zhang.
