They benchmarked their method with existing SOTA methods like DiffSBDD, Pocket2Mol, and TargetDiff. The results show this method could achieve better performance in terms of molecular property scores and speed."

This raises questions about the novelty of the generated drug.\n\nFurthermore, there is a lack of clarity regarding whether bond types are preserved in the unlabeled graph. Even if bond types are not preserved, it is not intuitively clear whether there is enough flexibility for atom type when the graph structure is fixed. \n\nIn light of these concerns, the focus on overall diversity is not as meaningful as it could be. It would be more informative to assess and showcase the diversity of generated ligands for each template unlabeled graph. This analysis can reveal the extent of chemical variation achieved by the method, which is a more relevant measure of its potential impact. If the changes between the generated ligands and the template ligands are minor or do not significantly affect the chemical properties, the overall impact of the method may be considerably diminished. \n\nWithout more evidence and explanation regarding the mentioned issues, I think comparing the drug repurpose-like generating method with the de-novo generating method is not fair enough. It might be more appropriate to compare it with other drug repurposing methods."

In general, especially from the perspective of structural biology, the protein-ligand interaction is strongly dependent on atom types, positions. However, in this paper, the only dependence on proteins is used to infer the unlabeled molecular graph where only topology information is used. And the second stage does not involve modelling the protein pockets. This contradicts with the fundamental knowledge of structural biology. \n2. The main concern about the experiments is about the fairness of comparison with baselines. First, FastSBDD leverages additional molecular dataset, such as ZINC and ChemBL, while other baselines does not use additional datasets. Second, optimization is condered in FastSBDD. But the baselines are all generative methods. No optimization methods, such as MARS [1] and RGA [2], are included. From my perspective, it is more proper to compare FastSBDD with molecular optimization methods. RGA is a molecular optimization method proposed for SBDD.\n3. Besides, many important SBDD baselines are missing, such as DecmopDiff [3].\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Xie, Yutong, et al. \"Mars: Markov molecular sampling for multi-objective drug discovery.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.10432 (2021).\n\n[2] Fu, Tianfan, et al. \"Reinforced genetic algorithm for structure-based drug design.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 12325-12338.\n\n[3] Guan, Jiaqi, et al. \"DecompDiff: Diffusion Models with Decomposed Priors for Structure-Based Drug Design.\" (2023)."

The authors build a binding affinity prediction model to select unlabelled graphs with best predicted affinities. The atom type generation module can be a sampler, MoFlow based generator or a generator combined with property filters. The authors perform experiments on Crossdocked2020 and show that their model can achieve better performance with much less time cost.

Otherwise, the Vina score should have a large change. \n- The assumption justification is needed about why the unlabelled graph sampler could be independent of protein\n- The proposed method has many filtering operations (filter high-affinity molecules with binding affinity scoring model, filter high QED+SA molecules in the atom type assignment phase) during the generation process. It would be fairer to compare with optimization-based models or compare with generative models and apply a similar property screening operation as post-processing.\n- The proposed method can not generate novel 2D graph structures.
