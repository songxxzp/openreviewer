The improvement over GAN-based method is not obvious when the texture is on. They all seem realistic.\n3. The time complexity should be analyzed, with comparisons over prior methods."

What\u2019s worse, even looking at the appendix, I\u2019m still unable to find out the width of the MLP layers for the triplane decoder.\n    - I find it a bit hard to imagine what exactly the architectures are for the different variants in the ablation \u201cStudies of 3D-aware transformer modules\u201d. The authors might want to elaborate more in the appendix, or better draw figures to the ablated architectures.\n    - Section 4.3 mentioned about the importance of triplane normalization.

What\u2019s the size of the shared triplane decoder?\n3. For the 3D-aware transformer part, as the triplane resolution is only 16x16 and the patch size is 2, this means that there\u2019re only 8x8=64 tokens on each plane, and 64x3=192 tokens in total. Why not just do self-attention over all these 192 tokens, instead of using the cross-plane attention? Would this simpler architecture also work? In fact, looking at figure 3(b), such simple self-attention is already used in the 3D-aware encoder/decoder.\n4. How does the proposed cross-plane attention compared against Rodin\u2019s 3D-aware convolution? Does it make sense to compare with this work qualitatively and quantitatively, as the cross-plane attention seems a major contribution of this work?\n\tRodin: A Generative Model for Sculpting 3D Digital Avatars Using Diffusion\n5. It seems that the model is trained per-category on shapenet cars, chairs, airplanes? Why not train a class-conditioned generator just like what has been done on the OmniObject3d data?"
