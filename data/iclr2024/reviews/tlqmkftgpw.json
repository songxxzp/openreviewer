DBRNet learns disentangled representations using a loss term based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between latent factors and imbalance loss term. Moreover, selection bias is addressed by using inverse propensity score based weighting to the factual loss term. They used synthetic and two semi-synthetic datasets to evaluate the model against the existing techniques."

Introduction clearly presents the problem and motivations for the work, and related work puts the work in context, and presents the literature gap. Similarly, methdology is also presented with sufficient details.\n- Sufficient experiments with detailed ablation study to prove the effficacy of the method as well as different components of the idea. Paper clearly formulates the research questions and provide empirical evidence for each.\n- Paper provides theoretical substantiation that the devised re-weighting function is able to precisely adjust for selection bias."

                "value": "In general, there are multiple points in the evaluation of the paper which seem problematic or unclear to me:\n1. The paper is mainly motivated by learning the **individualized** dose response function. This is a different task than learning the **average** dose response function. Hence, the main metric for evaluation should be the MISE and not the AMSE (even though it is a nice add-on but not necessary). Thus, the MISE should also be the displayed metric e.g., in Fig. 3 and Table 3, and the main interpretation of the results should focus on the MISE. \n2. My understanding is that the MISE is not properly implemented (see also code). The paper approximates the integral over the treatments in the MISE by averaging over the existing treatments in the datasets $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$. However, since the datasets are biased with respect to the treatment assignment, this may yield biased estimates of the MISE. Instead one could use Romberg integration (as in [3]) are just simply use at least equally spaced points in $\\mathcal{T}$\n3. The sensitivity analysis in Fig. 3 states in the description: \u201c Sensitivity analysis with different values of $\\alpha, \\beta$\u201d, but the axis of the plots are $\\beta$ value and $\\gamma$ value which is confusing. Also, the plots for $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ do not show clear performance gains outside of the standard deviation bounds. This may indicate that the (quite substantial) performance gains reported in Table 2 are not significant because of the high variance of the method, or may be quite prone to hyperparameter tuning and model selection. Clarification here would be much appreciated.\n4. The paper argues that existing methods using selection bias adjustment \u201cfail to accurately adjust for selection bias, as they do not make any adjustments to eliminate the bias, or resort to a simple and sophisticated approach to balance the entire representation.\u201d While there is work on binary treatments showing this, it is important to benchmark against such methods in a continuous setting to support this argument, e.g., using the balancing applied in [4] as a baseline.\n5. The theory is primarily around re-weighting and not balancing. \n\nMinor: There are a many spacing issues with missing spaces around references. \n\n[1] Hassanpour, Negar, and Russell Greiner. \"Learning disentangled representations for counterfactual regression.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2019.\n[2] Nie, Lizhen, Mao Ye, and Dan Nicolae. \"VCNet and Functional Targeted Regularization For Learning Causal Effects of Continuous Treatments.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2020.\n[3] Schwab, Patrick, et al. \"Learning counterfactual representations for estimating individual dose-response curves.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

                "value": "1. I assume the \u201c_TR\u201d in the baseline methods refers to targeted regularization. However, TR is designed for ATE / ADRF estimation. Motivation about why these baselines are included (and still oftentimes outperform methods without TR even in MISE) would be appreciated.\n2. Why is alpha not included in the ablation studies? Its contribution could also be interesting, especially since only a very simplified density estimator is used and it could show if this still leads to performance gains.\n3. The discrepancy loss in Eq (5.) leverages KL divergence between representations. However, as I understand, the learned representations are not probabilistic so how is the KL divergence approximated which is defined as a measure between two probability distributions? Also, if there are some implicit assumptions here which are necessary to ensure statistical independence between the representations they should be stated."

                "value": "This paper aims to estimate the individual treatment effect (ITE) under continuous treatment setting. The authors claim that the latent covariates can be divided into three different kinds of variables, i.e., instrumental variable, confounder and adjustment variable, and the representations of confounders should be balanced across treatments.\nThe proposed DBRNet can address the above issues under theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of DBRNet."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1.\tThe motivation of this paper is convincing but lacks innovation because neither the disentangled representation nor the re-weighting technique is originally proposed in this paper. I hope the authors can provide deeper insights into why disentangled covariates should be considered in the context of continuous treatment settings.\n2.\tIn equation (5), why isn't there an enforcement of the discrepancy between the adjustment variable and the treatment variable? This point should be clarified.\n3.\tIn the experimental setting, it would be beneficial to compare the proposed method with more disentanglement-based baselines, such as DR-CFR[1] and DeR-CFR[2].\n[1] [ICLR'20] Learning Disentangled Representations for CounterFactual Regression\n[2] [ArXiv'20] Learning decomposed representation for counterfactual inference"
