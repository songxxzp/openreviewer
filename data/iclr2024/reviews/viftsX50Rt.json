In most cases, using a naive procedure to compute this function scales (at least) cubicly with the number of nodes in the graph. \n\nThe authors propose a new algorithm to circumvent this computational limitation. Inspired by a recent work by Krzysztof Marcin Choromanski (KMC), the authors introduce a new algorithm to approximate the value of arbitrary functions of the weighted matrix of the graph by using graph random features. Graph random features rely on the possibility to write the function of the weighted adjacency matrix as the expectation of finite dimensional vectors. The former vectors are obtained by using random walks on the graph. Contrary to the KMC's work, the author introduce the notion of modulation function that controls each walker\u2019s load as it traverses the graph. This extra modulation function allows the algorithm to approximate arbitrary functions of the weighted adjacency matrix.\n\nThe authors also show that this modulation function can be learned using neural network to solve some given task of interest."

Nevertheless, I think it would have been good to propose an experiment on real data that tackles one of the main applications mentioned in the introduction (such as community detection or recommender systems). \n\nIn particular, it is still an ongoing research question to find the right representation of a graph to use spectral methods for community detection. Indeed, using the adjacency matrix is known to be suboptimal in particular when dealing with sparse graphs. That's why people have proposed to use the non-backtracking matrix or the Bethe-Hessian. Since the authors show the interesting possibility to learn the modularity function to automatically selects a graph representation well suited for some downstream task, I think that a very interesting experiment would be to use their method to automatically select a good kernel for community detection. In particular, does the algorithm converge to a representation close to the non backtracking matrix ?\n\n\n- The authors do not discuss really how some parameters of the method are chosen in practice (such as the parameter $p_{halt}$), and how these choices influence the performance of the algorithm.\n\n- Real world graphs are known to be sparse. It would be interesting to comment of the influence on the algorithm when dealing with sparse graphs. A possibility would be to conduct simulated experiments by varying the sparsity level of the graph and see the impact of the performance.\n\nHere are some typos and additional comments: \n\n- In Eq.(9), I think a notation is missing since $\\alpha$ is not appearing in the mapping $x\\mapsto w^{\\top} \\psi_{K}(x)$. I think the correction would be $x\\mapsto w^{\\top} \\psi_{K_{\\alpha}}(x)$.\n\n- At the first line in section 3.1, I think a \"for\" is missing. It should be \"do indeed give unbiased estimates for the graph kernels\".\n\n- Between Eq.(13) and Eq.(14), I think there is an issue with the notations. Should $\\Phi$ depend on $\\tau_j$ ? Based on what I could understand, $\\Phi$ is a rectangular matrix of size $n\\times N$ where the $j$-th row is $\\Phi_j = ((t-\\tau_j) \\phi(i))_{i=1}^N$."

In addition, the authors extend their algorithm for estimating fixed graph kernels to a learnable approach, parametrizing a fixed modulation function with a two-layer neural network. The authors provide a simple generalization bound for the corresponding class of learnable graph kernels.
