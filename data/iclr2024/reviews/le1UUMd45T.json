The presented neural net architecture appears to be a minor variation of an existing one, specifically DACT.\n\n3. The employment of a shared baseline for REINFORCE isn't groundbreaking, as seen in POMO.\n\n4. Similarly, quality enhancement via instance augmentation isn't a pioneering approach.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that the specific methodologies deployed in the paper are novel, especially given this is the inaugural L2I application to MOCOPs, the broader insights readers can derive from this work seem somewhat limited."
