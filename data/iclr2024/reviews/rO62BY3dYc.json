PvR has one grouping module to group neurons for speeding up pruning process and one ranking module to estimate the importance of grouped neurons. It can reduce model depth, leading to training and inference efficiency wins. Apart from this, the authors suggest to retrain the subnet from scratch and proposes a metric called Geometric Complexity to measure its efficacy. The authors validated the PvR on several classic models comparing with other pruning methods."

It consists of two parts: (1) The output's L1 error before and after pruning a certain neuron (rescontruction error). (2) A constant error (hyper-parameter) if pruning a certain neuron leads to a different prediction result.\n2. Group similar neurons/channels according to the correlation.\n3. Prune unimportant groups. While the authors do not explain how to compute group importance according to neuron importance.

The authors introduce two very important hyperparameters: the constant error \"d\" and the group size. I think they will have a great influence on the final accuracy. The authors claim their algorithm applys to both vision and NLP models. However, it would meaningless if we have to carefully adjust these two hyper-parameters for the best accuracy on different models and tasks. This is my main concern.\n2. The authors claim the proposed algorithms consider the paramete budget. While as I know, all existing pruning methods can achieve this because it is a basic requirement. Take L1 norm based pruing as an example, you can consider the parameter budget by adjust the pruning threshold (This process is very fast with ignorable cost).\n3. Limited creativity. GC based initialization method is proposed by another paper, this paper only uses it.\n4. VGG-16 is a very redundant model for CIFAR-10 dataset. The has been a consensus in the field. I doubt whether the corresponding results are still convicing.\n5. I am not sure but the authors may not describe how to compute group importance according to neuron/channel/.. importance.\n6. Lack of some details. As the paper says, the proposed method achieves lower latency because of layer pruning. Could you please describe in which case the proposed methed will prune an entire layer?\n7.
