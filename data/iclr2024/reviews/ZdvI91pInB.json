Assuming demonstrations were generated by experts following an optimal energy-based policy, it alternates between learning a neural logic tree and learning policy until convergence with a GAN-framework from a previous work. The energy function is parameterized using logic-informed features given a set of generated logic rules. Specifically, a transformer-based reader encodes the observed state-action demonstrations to a set of Boolean logic variables (predicates), then a decoder predicts the next predicate based on the previously generated partial symbolic tree. Experiments on toy games and two highly correlated real healthcare datasets show overall improvement from several benchmarks under two metrics each."

The approach embodies inverse optimal control through policy optimization, where logic rules are learned from expert trajectories and serve as the energy function. The policy is optimized to estimate the energy model's partition function. Essentially, the policy is trained to generate state-action trajectories that minimize the energy function encoded from the currently learned logic rules, ensuring better adherence to the logic rules. The paper employs a GAN-style training scheme to update these logic rules by discerning trajectories generated by the policy from expert trajectories. The framework utilizes a neural logic tree generator to sequentially derive logic rules from goal variables, mimicking backward reasoning, and employs policy learning to determine the most effective path to achieve the end goal based on the current logic rules, akin to forward reasoning. This alternating process of backward and forward reasoning continues until convergence is attained, enabling the method to potentially learn the optimal probabilistic distribution of logic trees and the policy."

While Section 4.2 provides informative content and closely follows the prior work of deep PQR (Geng et al., 2020b), the central focus appears to be on the relationship between the discovered rewards and the learned logic rules. Unfortunately, the paper lacks concrete examples or evaluations to support this argument.
