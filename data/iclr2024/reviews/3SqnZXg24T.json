                "value": "1. Unclear Motivation: The motivations behind the various components in the overall framework constructed by the author seem to lack clear explanations. For instance, the initial intention of decomposition followed by enhancement, the benefits of introducing FPN, and the reasons for employing different training strategies at different stages, among other aspects, are not adequately addressed. Unfortunately, the author appears to have not provided relevant analyses for these issues. Furthermore, it is suggested that the author should provide additional evidence in their response to support their claims.\n2. Lack of Novelty: Whether it's the decomposition network based on Retinex, generative adversarial networks, attention mechanisms, or the range of introduced loss functions, these are common approaches for addressing low-light image enhancement problems. Additionally, while the idea of introducing FPN is promising, the lack of a clear explanation by the author impacts the inevitability of the contribution's novelty. In other words, this work appears more like a combination of existing effective techniques, leaving room for increased novelty.\n3. Unconvincing Experimental Results: Most of the visual results presented in the manuscript exhibit evident color shifts, and some even contain artifacts. In comparison to other methods, the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of qualitative results is hard to establish.\n4. Need for Improvement in Experimental Settings and Presentation: From the manuscript, it can be seen that the author conducted a series of comparative experiments on the LOL dataset, but it seems that no qualitative results are provided. I am curious about the performance of the proposed method on data from the LOL dataset that contains significant noise. Furthermore, it appears that no comparisons were made with low-light image enhancement methods proposed in 2023. As far as I am aware, there have been many recent representative advances in this field, and it is hoped that the author can include comparisons with them to more comprehensively validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nOverall, this work requires significant improvement in several aspects. The ablation experiments section also suffers from a lack of comprehensiveness. It is hoped that the author can provide sufficiently detailed responses to the above-mentioned issues."

In the second section of the method introduction, the author dedicates a significant amount of space to explaining specific network structures and the various constraints introduced, without providing an explanation for the reasons. In other words, the motivations for the various components in the proposed framework may require additional clarification from the author.\n3.
