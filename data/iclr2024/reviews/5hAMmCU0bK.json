                "value": "+ This study illuminates the susceptibility of existing offline RL algorithms while offering a promising approach to bolster their resilience in real-world environments. The proposed analysis is unquestionably relevant to the offline RL community. While there have been previous works (e.g., Zhang et al. (2022)) that offer theoretical analyses regarding the impact of using contaminated data in offline RL algorithms, this work appears to take it a step further by examining the impact of various forms of contamination (actions, states, etc.) and providing a highly detailed analysis for the offline IQL model. As a conclusion, it suggests a robust alternative for IQL, addressing how to mitigate its identified weaknesses.\n\n\n+ The theoretical and experimental analysis presented in Section 3 is elegantly and clearly articulated. The authors' discovery about the robustness of using a weighted imitation learning strategy is intriguing, but for the specific case of dynamics corruption, this doesn't seem to hold true. This observation leads them to propose up to three modifications to the IQL model to enhance its robustness. Each of these modifications (observation normalization, Huber loss, and quantile Q estimators) is well-founded and justified.\n\n+ The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and very detailed. First, all state-of-the-art models in offline-RL are assessed to see how they perform in perturbation scenarios. Once the analysis is completed, the article focuses on improvements for the IQL model. The environments used for the experiments are well-known within the community (Halfcheetah, Halfcheetah, Halfcheetah). The results presented are conclusive. I also appreciate the ablation study in section 5.3, which allows the reader to understand the impact of the modifications applied to IQL until achieving the robust version (RIQL)."

It would be interesting to hear the authors' opinion on this. I'm referring to the following environments: locomotion-v2, antmaze-xx, kitchen, adroit.\n\n- Somewhat, the theoretical analysis and the experimental evidence detailed in the section appear contradictory. The paper explicitly states this as follows: \"Our theoretical analysis suggests that the adoption of weighted imitation learning inherently offers robustness under data corruption. However, empirical results indicate that IQL still remains susceptible to dynamics attacks\".  This contradiction is not further examined in the manuscript. On the contrary, what is proposed is to address IQL's issue with dynamic attacks.\n\n- Previous works on certification protocols for offline RL against attacks has not been considered for the novel RIQL model proposed. This is an important weaknesses that should be addressed in the rebuttal. \n\n- Minor comments:\n(Wu, 2022) Update the reference as it is not anymore an ArXiv manuscript but an ICLR22 paper."

The random corruption setting used in the experiments is a bit unrealistic.\n\n    * If environmental noise exists, the entire dataset would be corrupted, not just a tiny portion as assumed in the experiments.\n\n    * Most offline RL datasets are collections of trajectories not $(s, a, r, s')$ 4-tuples. Adding random noise just to $s$ or $s'$ does not seem to make much sense.\n\n5. The adversarial corruption setting is not really \"adversarial\" towards algorithms other than EDAC since the adversarial noise was computed via projected gradient descent with respect to the Q functions learned by EDAC. To see whether RIQL is robust to malicious attacks, the adversarial noise should be computed with respect to $Q_\\alpha$ learned by RIQL.\n\n6. The paper does not contain experiments for sequence-modeling-based algorithms such as Decision Transformer (Chen et al., 2021) or Diffuser (Janner et al., 2022).
