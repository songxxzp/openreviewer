Instead of following the same approach for undirected cases (first define the spectrum based on Graph Fourier Transform, then define the filters based on spectral responses), the authors proposed to analyze the relationship between spectral response $g(\\lambda)$ and graph filter $g(T)$ directly when function $g$ comes from some constrained set. By observing an interesting connection between this problem and results from functional calculus, this paper presented a principal design for directed graph filters and two feasible approximations: faber polynomials and resolvent. Furthermore, the stabilities of these graph filters are established, and the simulations show that the new method outperforms other directed GNN baselines over several benchmark datasets."

The literature review and observations presented in this paper can be viewed as a general guidance to design convolutional kernels for directed graphs, and lay the theoretical foundations for other future works on this subject. Following the general design, this paper also introduced two computationally feasible filter banks to implement the directed graph kernels in practice, which achieves good results on standard benchmark datasets."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Although the technical insights shown in this paper are great and very interesting, the presentation of this paper, especially the main text, can be improved. I understand that the authors want to convey as much information as possible within the main text, but the main goal of this paper, which is the implementation of the practical directed convolutional kernels (layers), should still be explained clearly in detail. For example, after reading the entire paper, I still do not know if we need to perform the eigendecomposition of the graph operator or not. In other words, even if we set the function to be faber polynomials $\\Psi_k(\\lambda)=\\lambda^k/2^k$, what will $\\Psi_k(T)$ in this case, where $T$ is the operator? Do we still have to consult Eq (3) to compute $\\Psi_k(T)$, which can be computationally expensive? This type of question should be clearly explained in the main text to help readers better understand the big picture. A pseudocode of the algorithm/training procedure can help solve this issue.\n\nBesides the computation of graph kernels, some of the heuristic choices adopted in Holonets lack theoretical insights as well. For example, why do we need to use forward and backward filters separately? Why the operator is chosen to be $T=(D^{in})^{-1/4}W(D^{out})^{-1/4}$? Why use absolute value as the nonlinear activation, which is unusual in GNN literature? All of these choices seem to just come out of trial and error in simulations. It would be good if the authors could provide some further explanations for these choices.\n\nOne minor concern that I have is about the simulation of directed graph regression problems. I am not very convinced why we should treat this as a directed graph problem, and how it helps when we consider the edges to be directed and the nodes to be weighted. Maybe it has some physical/chemical meanings, but since I am not an expert in physics, I will leave this to other reviewers to decide.\n\nTwo other small comments: I would not describe the difference between the performance of FaberNet and that of Dir-GNN to be significant, as most of the differences are within one standard deviation. Also from the implementation side, Dir-GNN is much simpler than FaberNet; on page 5, \"Faber polynomials provide near near mini-max polynomial approximation\" there are two \"near\"."

Why is the normalization for $T$ $-1/4$ not $-1/2$? If in undirected case, I believe the practice is to use $D^{-1/2}$. Why is there a discrepancy? Also, I am not sure how this is related to the motivation stated in the paper \"We thus use as characteristic operator a matrix that avoids direct comparison of feature vectors of a node with those of immediate neighbours\".\n\n3. Where do the imaginary weights in FaberNet come from? Is it because the eigenvalues can be complex?"
