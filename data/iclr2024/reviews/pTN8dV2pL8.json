The key idea is to extend the geometry representation from scalar Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) to Gaussian fields of normals supervised by polarization priors. The paper introduces a pipeline for learning the surface by volume rendering, and presents a DoP reweighing strategy to alleviate noise and imbalance distribution problems of polarization priors. Additionally, a new multi-view dataset called PolRef, consisting of objects with reflective and less-textured surfaces, is collected to evaluate the performance of3D reconstruction methods. Experimental results show that GNERP improves the geometry details and accuracy of geometry and normals of reflective surfaces compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."

Further ablation studies can be useful to verify the effectiveness of Gaussian normal representation. \nSince Gaussian normal representation is the major novelty, it might be good to further verify its effectiveness with more ablation studies. One simple baseline is to render normal through standard volume ray tracing and then use reweighted $L_{\\mean}$ loss for training. That may give us a clear answer if we need to sample extra points to compute a Gaussian distribution. \n\n3.
