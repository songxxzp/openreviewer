                "value": "This raises some confusion for me about whether the primary focus of interest lies in multi-agent reinforcement learning, as mentioned at the beginning of Section 2, or if it is more aligned with distributed or parallel reinforcement learning: \n\n- For instance, if all agents operate within a single environment, I'm curious about how, during step 2 in the FMRL-LA framework, each agent learns its local behavior policy. Does the environment transition to the next timestep after receiving a single action from any agent, or does it wait for a vector of actions from all agents before transitioning? Is the system clocked synchronously? \n\n- On the other hand, if agents are operating in distributed environments, I'm interested in understanding whether it is still considered a cooperative multi-agent problem. How does the setup in this paper differ from distributed or federated reinforcement learning approaches such as [1,2]? \n\n \n\nThe paper bears the title \"Cost Efficiency,\" yet it lacks clarity regarding the extent of this efficiency. I highly recommend that the authors incorporate a thorough analysis and discussions concerning the costs, particularly in comparison to related works. \n\n \n\nIn terms of technique, it appears that the primary distinction between the proposed FMRL-LA and the existing FMARL framework lies in the introduction of the linear aggregation layer. I would like to suggest that the authors delve into a discussion regarding the significance of FMRL-LA as a technical contribution. \n\n\nAnother potential weakness is that the evaluation is limited to the customized tasks extending the MetaDrive environment. While this is a relevant and challenging problem domain, it would be beneficial to evaluate the proposed framework in other domains to demonstrate its generalizability. \n \n\nThe notation used in Figure 2 is not consistent with that in the main text of the paper. \n\nI would be pleased to revise my assessments once any misunderstandings have been resolved. \n \n\n\n[1] Chen, Y., Zhang, X., Zhang, K., Wang, M., & Zhu, X.

Specifically, asynchronous critics were used to optimize communication efficiency by filtering out redundant local updates based on the estimation of agent utilities, and a centralized aggregator rectifies these estimations conditioned on global information to improve cooperation and reduce non-i.i.d. impact by maximizing the composite system objectives. It was claimed that the proposed FMRL-LA can optimize system performance and efficiency simultaneously, delivering a balanced performance across the metrics corresponding to composite objectives.

It would be helpful if the authors could provide comprehensive benchmark performance comparison between existing algorithms (e.g., FMARL) and the proposed FMRL-LA on broad non-iid task scenarios, understand how significant/insignificant of the non-iid impact on more representative MARL applications, and evaluate how much advantage FMRL-LA has and whether it consistently demonstrates significant gains compared with existing methods. \n\nCompared with existing literature (e.g., FMARL), the contribution/novelty in this work seems incremental (though still valuable), and it is not sufficiently convincing that the contribution is significant enough for a regular paper at such a top tier conference like ICLR."
