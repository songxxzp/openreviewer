Specifically, the method tries to alleviate the problem of barren plateaus, by a hierarchical approach to sequentially learn reduced target states. This approach is inspired by classical diffusion models. The new algorithm is theoretically analyzed regarding its efficiency and indicating improved trainability which alleviates the barren plateau problem. Finally, the algorithm is empirically evaluated against a global QNN on diverse quantum state learning problems, as well as characterized under noisy conditions. \n\nI am impressed by the asymptotic improvements of gradient variances which are also confirmed in experiment but this assessment is with low confidence. The main problem I see is that authors seem to ignore prior work aiming to improve QNNs already in both theory and experiments."

Why did the authors not compare to any of the listed works that already tried/claimed to solve the Barren Plateau problem? If, for whatever reason, such comparisons are not applicable, they should at least explain why these comparisons do not apply. This critique applies to both theory and experiments."

(Might be a dumb question, as authors explicitly try to devise a better QNN learning algorithm.) Is there a fundamental computability limit that quantum computing approaches can overcome for such a task?\n\n- Proposition 1 seems to be vacuous. Do I get that correctly that the correct state \"could\" be produced by QSSM if $U_k$ has a certain width w_k? So I don't know this width in practice and even if it is large enough, the algorithm may very well produce some $\\sigma \\neq \\rho$? I know it is \"advertised\" only as a sufficient condition, but still this seems very weak to me. Still interesting though, is that they find that the necessary $w_k$ scales logarithmically.\n\n- As far as I understood the Barren Plateau problem, the probability that the gradient vanishes grows exponentially in n, i.e., the variance of the gradient becomes exponentially small, i.e., O(2^\u207bn). Authors claim their method achieves O(2^-n/2) and in some situations even O(1). This analysis only compares to the \u201cnaive\u201d QNN and not to any of the other works trying to overcome the problem already? \n\n- How were the experiments chosen? Are those widely considered benchmarks in the field or do they represent especially challenging tasks for the QNN approach? Also, what is the idea behind the (high dimensional?) Gaussian distribution and MNIST? What is the input there and what is the target?\n\n- Why does the cost magnitude increase for each step (Figure 3 a)?\n\n- Where is Table 2? Is it the one that is part of Figure 2? What are the numbers in this table (I think it is the fidelity), how are they obtained, what would be \"worst\" and \"best\" performance, what do bold numbers mean?\n\n- Why are there no confidence intervals? Parameters are random initially, therefore not clear what re-runs of QSSM would produce.\n\n- How would QNN compare on the MNIST task shown in Figure 2?\n\n- How can it be that more width sometimes \"hurts\"?\n\n- Is there any intuition, why the variances in the n/2-th step is lower than in the first step, but the last step is the highest of all three (Figure 4)? Also, how can the variance tend to decrease for the n/2-th step (Figure 4 b), but stay constant for the first and last step?\n\n**Minor Remarks**:\n\n- The relation of the approach to diffusion models that is stated throughout the paper could be explained more plainly.\n\n- Enumeration of main results would be better in introduction\n\n- Subsections / paragraph headers in experimental section would increase comprehensibility of experiments\n\n- The GHZ state is not introduced in the main paper, only in supplements. Given that a major experiment utilizes this concept and an example for the usefulness of the variance bound on the gradient is based on it, it should be introduced properly in the main paper."

                "value": "While the paper attempts to contribute to the field of quantum machine learning with the QSSM model, there are critical issues that necessitate a strong rejection in its current form. The proposal of a polynomial representation of quantum states within classical architecture directly conflicts with widely accepted complexity theory. This discrepancy is not adequately reconciled in the paper and fundamentally undermines the proposed model's theoretical basis, as it deviates from the established understandings presented by Aharonov and Ta-Shma.\n\nThe benchmarking methodology is another significant concern. The choice of a QNN solver, known to be suboptimal for state learning tasks, as the primary point of comparison, lacks rigor and fails to convincingly demonstrate the superiority or novelty of the QSSM model. More appropriate and challenging benchmarks are essential for a fair assessment of the model's capabilities.\n\nThe treatment of purification schemes and the details of the Uk circuit are insufficiently addressed, missing the necessary clarity to be deemed innovative. This lack of detail leaves the claims of the paper unsubstantiated.\n\nAdditionally, the paper\u2019s approach to mitigating barren plateaus by limiting parameters introduces a severe restriction on the model's representability, yet this critical trade-off is not thoroughly explored. The implications of such a design choice on the model's scalability and learning capacity are not adequately discussed.\n\nLastly, the paper's empirical results \u2013 notably the suboptimal fidelity in learning the GHZ state \u2013 are not only below the benchmark set by existing literature but also indicative of possible fundamental flaws in the proposed architecture or learning algorithm.\n\nDue to these substantial shortcomings, which collectively cast doubt on the validity and contribution of the paper to the field, a strong rejection is recommended. Without a thorough revision that addresses the theoretical inconsistencies, expands upon the experimental comparisons, and offers a more in-depth analysis of the proposed architecture\u2019s implications, the paper does not meet the standards for acceptance in a computer science conference."
