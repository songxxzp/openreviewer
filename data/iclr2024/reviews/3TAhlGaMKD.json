In particular, prompt injection attacks are a major security threat which do not seem to be covered here at all.

In section 3.2, it is not clear what is meant by the sentence \"Subsequently, we calibrate the hyperparameters of LoRA and SPT to align their performance with that of ICL.\" What exactly are the steps taken to ensure that the comparison of these methods is apples-to-apples? How can adding, say, 4 ICL examples be equated to performing LoRA with hundreds of training samples?\n4. In the model stealing, the success of the attack is quantified by a certain \"agreement\" score between the target model and a surrogate model. Can the authors please define what this metric exactly is, as it is not available anywhere."

The results show that not every fine-tuning method is equally susceptible to all three attacks. For example, while ICL is mostly resilient against backdoor attacks, membership inference attacks are very successful against models fine-tuned using ICL. Overall, it seems that each of these fine-tuning methods have their pros and cons regarding the susceptibility to security and privacy attacks. The paper raises awareness of these risks when using these fine-tuning methods."

This allows the reader to quickly see how effective the backdoor attack is.\n- With the limited context length of the LLMs it is hard to make a definitive conclusion about the susceptibility of ICL to membership inference attacks. There seems to be a trend that increasing the number of given examples reduces the susceptibility.

Recent and more advanced attacks like LiRA [1] should be used. Similarly recent model stealing and backdoor attacks are not evaluated in the paper. \n2.\tThe paper only reports the evaluation results. However, the in-depth analysis of the results is missing. For example, why do LoRA and SPT achieve good privacy performance against membership inference attacks? Does the number of training samples or the number of training iterations play an important role in security/privacy risk? More in-depth ablations would benefit the paper.\n3.\tThe security and privacy evaluation results do not include the accuracy results, which is insufficient. Typically, there exists a trade-off between accuracy and security/privacy. \n4.\tIt would be interesting to compare three adaptation techniques with a na\u00efve fine-tuning approach regarding the security and privacy risks.\n\n[1] Carlini, Nicholas, Steve Chien, Milad Nasr, Shuang Song, Andreas Terzis, and Florian Tramer. \"Membership inference attacks from first principles.\" In 2022 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), pp. 1897-1914.
