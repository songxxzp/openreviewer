In particular, they develop an adaptive routing strategy that routes tokens to the denoised state only if the router outputs high scores instead of uniformly processing all the tokens.  And extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the text generation capability of their model, demonstrating significant improvements over existing diffusion models\n\nIn my opinion, this is a novel work that divides the generative process into two processes, consisting of a noise token and an unnoise token. Generally, if the state is a noise token, the generative process selects to denoise with a neural network. If the state is an unnoise token, the generative process selects to add noise. Compared with the base diffusion model, this method reduces the generative difficulty of the generative network, which only needs to take denoise tasks.   From another principle, the method can be seen as a decoupling method that makes the nework not need to learn two tasks (add noise and denoise) at the same time."

The reasoning behind dividing the diffusion of tokens into two conditions by comparing with the original input is not well-justified. Additionally, the paper does not provide a thorough theoretical analysis to support the claim that the proposed method can lead to better results compared to the original diffusion process.\n\n- The proposed method appears to borrow heavily from masked language modeling techniques that have already been utilized in non-autoregressive text generation works, such as CMLM, DisCo, and others. Furthermore, existing discrete diffusion models like improved VQ-Diffusion have proposed advanced models that consider each token separately, making the contribution of the proposed method less novel and impactful.\n\n- The performance improvements demonstrated by the proposed method over the discrete diffusion baseline are not consistent across different tasks and metrics. This raises concerns about the generalizability and robustness of the proposed method for various text generation tasks.\n\n- The choice of baselines and metrics for comparison in the experiments could be more appropriate. For example, in Figure 2 (b), the comparison with Diffuseq, a continuous baseline, is not suitable, and the performance of Diffuseq is not well-explained. Moreover, the paper does not follow the experimental settings of CMLM, which achieves higher performance in their original paper.\n\n- The paper does not provide an in-depth analysis of the discrepancy between training and inference introduced by the proposed method. The decoding method presented is similar to existing mask-predict and easy-first policies applied in non-autoregressive or diffusion models, raising questions about the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\n- The paper does not include a comprehensive ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its individual components. A detailed ablation study could provide insights into the contribution of each component to the overall performance improvements.\n\n- The experiments in the paper focus mainly on conditional text generation tasks, where a source input is provided. It remains unclear whether the proposed reparameterization approach can also enhance performance in other text generation tasks, such as unconditional language modeling, limiting the potential impact and generalizability of the method.\n\nIn light of the above weaknesses, I recommend rejecting this paper as it has limited contribution to the field, lacks a clear motivation, and its improvements over the baselines are not consistent or substantial."

The authors propose a novel reparameterized discrete diffusion model (RDM) by re-examining the sampling process from discrete diffusion models. They introduce a route-and-denoise process that includes a stochastic routing mechanism, which makes the training more efficient by simplifying the training objective to a reweighted standard cross-entropy loss. This new family of models, RDMs, demonstrates significant improvements in terms of effectiveness and flexibility over existing diffusion models in text generation tasks.\n\nThe RDMs achieve high-quality text generation by offering a more effective training and decoding process, which can be highly flexible and adaptive. The model's performance is evaluated across various text generation benchmarks, showing superior results over both existing discrete and continuous diffusion models while operating several orders of magnitude faster. This work pushes the boundaries of non-autoregressive text generation, providing a fresh perspective on the discrete diffusion approach and opening pathways for further research and application in more complex language tasks."

This is not only because of the concerns for a fair and thorough comparison. This is more because of the fact that such non-autoregressive models **are** text diffusion models that has a diffusion process defined as operating the discrete tokens. Levenshtein Transformer, for example, is cited yet not quite compared in many of the experiments, which limits the soundness of the experiments. I encourage the authors to add them in (many of the results can actually be directly borrowed from their original paper I think).\n\n- Limited Choice of Tasks that Raises Concerns of Overclaiming: This method is now mostly tested on semantically deterministic tasks like Machine Translation. There's still a very huge gap between getting the model to function on MT tasks and getting it to produce diverse, informative outputs on open-domain text generation tasks. With this concern, I would tend to suggest the authors to claim smaller, to restrict the claim to be a diffusion-based machine translation model instead of claiming it as a diffusion-based text generation model."

But I would be more convinced about the practical value if I see such results in the experiment section (since the model itself is already falling short in terms of #refinements compared to LevT, but if each refinement with RDM is computationally cheaper, there's still a chance for RDM to be faster)"
