This seemingly simple trick makes the loss satisfy the Quadratic Growth condition with a unique minimum. Consequently, an $O(\\log T)$ regret for the online regression with KL loss and squared loss is established. \n\nFurthermore, this paper provides a lower bound of $\\Omega(T)$ for NeuralUCB and NeuralTS with an oblivious adversary.\n\nFinally, Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform baselines on 6 classification datasets."

From what I understood, compared to the past results of Chen which just used Assumption 2a, this result exploited 2b and 2c to gain an improvement. This is akin to the fast rates that one gets for gradient descent run on strongly convex functions vs convex functions. Though the result is natural and intuitive based on Chen, I failed to understand what technical contributions the authors made to achieve the result in Theorem 3.1. Is this a straightforward application of existing results, or did it require a new perspective? Is the noise perturbation the main novelty?  Further discussion would have helped couch this work in the existing literature.\n\n- I was a bit confused about why Section 4 was presented in the context of KL-loss. Presumably it applies to squared loss as well given the results of the previous sections?\n\n- I have some concerns about the experiments. Building on the previous comment, it seems that part of the novelty of this paper is the use of a perturbed neural network. In the experiments you compare your algorithm using KL loss to NeuSquareCB and show an improvement. However, it feels like the natural comparison would be NeuFastCB against a variant using the KL loss where you don\u2019t perturb. Similarly for the square loss. This \u201cablation\u201d-esque study would highlight the important of the algorithmic contributions you have proposed.\n\nMinor Typos\n\n- theta_t in equation 4 should be theta"
