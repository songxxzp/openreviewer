The evaluation only includes one type of prompt injection, while there are various forms, including direct prompt injection, as mentioned in your paper. Using the proposed benchmark to evaluate the robustness of LLMs against prompt injection lacks comprehensiveness. Meanwhile, the evaluation dataset consists of only 500 samples, which is somewhat small for comprehensive evaluation."

Yet, this proficiency brings about concerns regarding adversarial instruction amplification which can be exploited by third-party attackers to alter LLMs' original instructions, triggering unintended actions. To address this, the paper introduces a novel benchmark to autonomously assess the robustness of LLMs against adversarial instructions within prompts. The benchmark aims to measure the susceptibility of LLMs to such adversarial intrusions and their discernment between adversarial and original instructions. Through experimentation with cutting-edge instruction-following LLMs, the paper reveals notable robustness limitations against adversarial instruction attacks. It also finds that prevailing instruction-tuned models tend to overfit to any instruction in the prompt, without genuine understanding, accentuating the necessity to tackle the challenge of training models to comprehend prompts rather than merely following instructions and generating text."
