The proposed unrolled LRP for benefits from having layer-wise guidance from the heatmaps with the skip and tied-in connections for accurate segmentation map prediction. However, it remains somewhat unclear whether this directly leads to improved segmentation performance, as indicated by the authors. It might be the case that the segmentation results are more closely tied to the quality of the heatmaps. Nevertheless, I feel that the idea is novel and is of sufficient interest to the research community.\n- The paper makes use of standard training objectives with the proposed unrolled LRP for semi-supervised segmentation, thereby making it directly usable with any task specific architectures. In general, I am in favour of simple and easy to plug-in methods that can complement already existing approaches.\n- The proposed method is well supported by experiment results. The empirical finding that concurrent training for classification and segmentation does not compromise classifier performance and holds up comparably to conventional segmentation architectures is quite intriguing. This finding suggests that the method is more generalizable to classification as well as segmentation."

This heatmap quality significantly based on amount of available data and the distribution of classes within a dataset. We already know that classification approaches tend to suffer in performance when there is imbalance in the number of samples per class, and I suspect that challenge may also extend to the segmentation performance. How robust is this method to such real-world scenarios with dataset and class imbalances?"

Is the method able to handle this?\n- How would the losses from orthogonal semi-supervised segmentation approaches affect the training with an unrolled LRP? Do you expect to see better performances?\n- There is no code currently available, will the authors make it available at some point?"
