Quality: The results presented in Tables 6, 7, and 8 demonstrate the superior performance of RNA compared to other baseline approaches across various OOD test sets. RNA achieves the best results for all six OOD test sets when trained on CIFAR10-LT and achieves the best results on four OOD test sets as well as on average when trained on CIFAR100-LT.\n3.  Clarity: The information provided in the tables is clear and concise, allowing for easy comparison of the performance of different methods. The description of the proposed method, RNA, is also clear and provides a good understanding of how it addresses the limitations of previous approaches.\n4.  Significance: The ability to simultaneously achieve high OOD detection performance and accurate long-tailed recognition is significant in various applications, especially in scenarios where both goals are crucial. The proposed RNA method offers a promising solution to this challenge and outperforms other baseline approaches in terms of both OOD detection metrics and classification accuracy."

Additionally, It is better to provide theoretical derivation and discuss the potential impact of this approach on the overall training dynamics and convergence behavior would provide further insights.\n2. The paper mentions that the proposed RNA method addresses the overconfidence problem of OOD samples and the underconfidence problem of tail-class ID samples. It would be helpful to provide more insights into how the proposed method achieves this and how it compares to other techniques, such as ODIN (Liang et al., 2018) and LogitNorm (Wei et al., 2022), which also aim to mitigate overconfidence issues. Providing a more detailed analysis and comparison of these techniques would enhance the understanding of the proposed method's effectiveness.\n3.

Otherwise you can remove these auxiliary OOD data without affecting the resulting model.\n- The motivation only considers the conflict with one of the OOD methods, outlier exposure. However, the motivation of using outlier exposure in the first place is not explained. There are a lot of post-hoc OOD methods, such as Mahalanobis [a], ViM [b], ASH [c], etc that does not requrire training. Does LA conflicts with these post-hoc methods? It is interesting to compare with the performance of LA + a/b/c (to show that exposing OOD in training is necessary) and LA + RNA + a/b/c (to show that the norm is a good OOD scoring function).\n- There is only 1 OOD dataset of ImageNet-1K LT, which is inadequate. It would be great to test more OOD datasets such as Texture and OpenImage-O.\n- Page 8 \"The different trends may be due to the difference in the number of classes of each dataset ...
