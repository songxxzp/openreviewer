This paper only demonstrates a $\\sqrt{T}$ rate in a fully stochastic setting when condition 2 holds. Furthermore, the 'best-of-both-worlds' literature in CMDPs is not discussed at all. Additionally, many algorithms can achieve zero constraint violations. Therefore it's unclear if this is the best achievable result.\n\n- All the theoretical results are standard, and the use of projection to bound the dual variable for boundedness is not surprising.\n\n- In the unconstrained case, several works have discussed bandit feedback and constraint violation without cancellation. However, the authors have not provided much insight into the challenges of removing these assumptions and studying the stronger setting.\n\n[1] Matteo Castiglioni, Andrea Celli, Alberto Marchesi, Giulia Romano, and Nicola Gatti.
