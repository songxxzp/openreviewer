Traditionally, achieving this has necessitated the manual engineering of appropriate diversity measures and incorporating them explicitly in the algorithm. In this paper, the authors introduce a new approach: they transform the original single objective into multiple objectives for the search algorithms, which promotes better exploration as well. This strategy produces superior results in the two domains that present deceptive challenges for search algorithms when compared to the performance of MAP-Elites."

The authors argue that by utilizing lexicase selection to optimize the sub-aggregated objectives, maintaining explicit diversity measures becomes unnecessary, as implicit diversity is ensured. This objective-driven method surpasses the performance of the cutting-edge quality diversity algorithm, MAP-Elites, specifically on misleading domains, achieving competitive results even though it does not explicitly prioritize diversity. Additionally, an ablation study confirms the reliability of the sub-aggregation technique by demonstrating that various sub-aggregation strategies produce comparable performance, showcasing the algorithm's adaptability."
