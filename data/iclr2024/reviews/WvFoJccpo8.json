                "value": "This manuscript proposes QA-LoRA, a LoRA based parameter efficient LLM finetuning scheme with quantization. QA-LoRA extends QLoRA to be able to add low-rank matrices with pre-trained weights in low-bit tensors directly, without the need to PTQ on low-rank matrices. To guarantee that the summation of low-rank matrices and pre-trained weights are still within the same quantization range, the authors relax the requirement of each row being the same into groups, through group-wise quantization. This improves the accuracy and efficiency during inference. During evaluation, the authors experimented with a series of LLaMA and LLaMA2 models with different sizes. Results showed that the proposed models can achieve superior performance than LoRA and QLoRA."

Also, the proposed QA-LoRA reduces the size of low-rank matrices. However, these parameter offsets are not reflected in the results, which could be misleading to the audiences. It would be more informative to add the actual model size (or estimated) in MB/GB for each of the models.\n* In the ablation study, only group size is examined. It would be worthwhile to experiment with the D_int as well, as it is also part of the tradeoff between model size and accuracy. It would be interesting to see what is the lowest D_int in this setup, compared to vanilla LoRA."

This work comes improves Q-LORA algorithm by introducing group-wise operators which lift the need for post-training quantization. QA-LoRA implementation is simple and generic. It benefits from a balance between the number of parameters required for adaption and quantization. The experiments show that fine-tuning and inference stages are computationally efficient thanks to the use of INT4. The memory footprint of QA-LoRA is lower than QLoRA. In terms task accuracy, QA-LoRA is better than Q-LoRA with post-training quantization (GPTQ)."

QLoRA initially quantizes neural network weights to NF4 format and subsequently optimizes LoRA matrix weights in FP16. This process increases inference latency, as everything is converted to FP16 during inference. The proposed alternative method outlined in this paper ensures the appropriate quantization of LoRA weights without necessitating a reversion to FP16 during inference. This enhancement involves just a few lines of code, offering a more efficient solution. While the paper lacks specific results and comprehensive explanations, it presents a promising direction for optimizing large language model training within constrained computational budgets."
