                "value": "This paper adds to the growing body of literature with respect to distribution free uncertainty quantification and risk control.  While most work in this area descends from the line of work concerned with Conformal Prediction, the field was really expanded and energized by the work of Angelopoulos et al (2021) called Learn Then Test, which introduces a method for performing hypothesis/model/parameter selection based on multi-hypothesis testing (MHT) and family-wise error rates.  One clear inefficiency of this LTT procedure is that statistical power is lost as more hypotheses are considered; this issue was directly addressed in the work of Laufer-Goldshtein et al (2022), wherein an initial step is added in order to narrow some larger configuration space down to a set of hypotheses that are worth considering during MHT.\n\nThe current submission aims to further build on the work of Laufer-Goldshtein.  Their algorithm modifies Laufer-Goldshtein in two key ways, by: 1) further narrowing the hypothesis search space by defining a region of interest based on various loss calculations on a validation set prior to testing 2) using Bayesian Optimization to efficiently identify configurations that both are Pareto-optimal and lie within the region of interest.  They apply their algorithm to important problems like fair and robust classification, image generation, and large model pruning."

Though risk control techniques are a key ingredient in responsible machine learning deployment, they are limited by the fact that they either have to ignore a large part of the search space or sacrifice statistical power in order to consider all reasonable hyperparameter settings.  While this was addressed in the previous Pareto Testing paper, more work in this direction is great.  The idea of further reducing the search space using the validation set and BO seems quite natural."

                "value": "-I find the definition of the region of interest to be under-motivated.  It is not clear why the region of interest is defined in this way; it would be useful to further motivate the definition by some worked example or analysis, and the definition could be compared/contrasted with other possible ways for defining the region.  It may be the case that the algorithm is primarily focused on the case where objectives are conflicting; if this is so, it should be stated more clearly, along with a description of how the algorithm will perform when this is not the case.\n\n-While the authors seem to be motivated by the problem of \u201cexpansive high-volume configuration spaces\u201d, their experimental applications seem to have configuration spaces that are of a similar size as those in previous work.  While performing better in these spaces is useful, it would also be interesting to see that this algorithm enables some new class of problem(s) to be addressed via MHT.  \n\n-In addition, the experiments section does not make a strong case for the current algorithm.  There are several reasons for this: \n\n1) Unexplained hyperparameter choices - how is $\\delta'$ chosen?  This seems very important, and I see no mention of this in the experiments section (also see questions below).\n\n2) Unclear how limits of x-axes were chosen - Why should we only be concerned with $\\alpha \\in [0.165, 0.18]$ for Figure 3(a) or $\\alpha \\in [0.055, 0.07]$ in Figure 3(b)?  These choices seem arbitrary, and make it hard to takeaway that the method is generally better than the simple baseline.\n\n3) Insignificant results based on standard deviation - Figure 3(a) and 3(b) do not show the proposed algorithm to be much better than a fairly naive baseline in what seems to be a highly-controlled setting (see (1) and (2) above).  \n\n-Further building on the previous comment, I think the experiments section would benefit from a focus on less results that are more clearly explained.  Even examining the details in the appendix leaves many experimental choices a mystery.\n\n-Since it is not clear why this definition of the region of interest is of particular significance (either via analysis or empirical results), I find the contribution to be incremental and short of the acceptance threshold, although I could be convinced otherwise by other reviews and/or author rebuttals (see questions below)."

Since the authors are solving an important problem, I could be convinced to raise my score if I can come to a better understanding of why this is a particularly well-motivated and effective solution:\n\n-Can you give a more detailed explanation of the rationale behind the definition of the ROI?  When is it expected to be most effective, and when may it fail?\n\n-Can you more concretely characterize the efficiency of your method in relation to Pareto Testing?  How much compute or time is actually being saved, and how much performance is lost compared to full Pareto Testing?  I think this should be covered more thoroughly in the experiments section, as this seems to be the main comparison made prior to the experiments section.\n\n-How is $\\delta'$ chosen? This seems like an important parameter, but I cannot find a reference to its value in the experiments, nevermind how that value is chosen.  Right now, it seems possible that equation (7) is not actually that important, but instead the ROI is just based on a heuristic choice of tolerance around $\\alpha^{max}$.  An ablation with respect to this parameter would also be helpful."

The method of defining the region of interest and the reference point is not theoretically backed, which means that its usefulness is supported purely by the empirical results. However, the empirical investigation compares the entire procedure to existing MOBO algorithms (under only the Pruning setting), and the existing MOBO algorithms do not undergo the testing procedure. It is unclear how much of the performance gain is due to the main contribution (region of interest and reference point) and how much is due to the testing. The paper should include ablation studies to empirically support the claim that the main contribution is useful. How does the proposed method perform without defining the region of interest? How about if it is only a lower bound instead of an interval? It may turn out that most of the performance gain is due to the testing, rendering the main contribution not useful.\n\n    Furthermore, it is not clear why no previous baselines are tested in the results for Figures 3 and 5.

                "value": "Please see the weakness part. Plus the following\n\n1. How does the proposed method perform in situations with extremely high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces?\n\n2. How sensitive is the proposed method to the initial definition of the \"region of interest\"? Is there a risk of introducing bias based on this region?\n\n3. Given that Bayesian Optimization inherently deals with a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, how does the new approach ensure a balance, especially with the introduced \"region of interest\"?\n\n4. In practical terms, what would be the computational overhead of the proposed method compared to traditional BO or other hyper-parameter optimization techniques?"
