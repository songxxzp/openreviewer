                "value": "The manuscript studies the problem of multi-label classification with budgeted (top-k) prediction metrics. The problem is very well established by now, and of much practical relevance. The paper is overall well motivated, well-written, and the contributions are par for the venue.\n\nI see two key contributions: 1) formalizing the empirical uitility maximation notion of '@k' metrics as that of optimizing over certain classes of confusion matrices, which decomposes over individual labels, but the optimization problem itself doesn't decompose easily because of the constraint that any classifier in the hypothesis space must output exactly k labels per instance; 2) deriving a neat form for the Bayes optimal, which yields interpretable closed form solutions for well-known metrics like recall and balanced accuracy; the most-general closed form solution is not very useful because it depends on the optimal values --- this observation by itself is not novel, as pretty much every paper that talks about non-decomposable losses for binary/multi-label classification problems (several of which are clearly cited in the paper) have developed similar results.  \n\nGiven the form of the Bayes optimal, Frank-Wolfe based algorithm for estimating the classifiers can be written down, following the work of Narasimhan et al. (2015). The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, and the consistency between optimal Bayes rule and the algorithmic convergence for certain measures, compared to several natural baselines.\n\nOverall, I like the work and I am inclined to accept. I've some minor concerns which I outline under 'weaknesses' section. It would be good to hear from the authors on these questions in their rebuttal.\n\n-- Post rebuttal --\nMost of my concerns are addressed. I'm more positive about the paper now."
