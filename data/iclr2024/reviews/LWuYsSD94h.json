                "value": "This paper delves into the multi-agent general sum Markov games framework within nonstationary environments. The scenario involves m agents where, at each step, a policy selects a joint action (a_h = (a_1, ..., a_m)), and each player i receives a random reward (r_{h,i}). The subsequent state at h+1 (s_{h+1}) is drawn from P_h( |s_h, a_h). To accommodate nonstationarity, Markov games can undergo changes in transition probability or reward function over time.\n\nThe primary contribution of the authors lies in highlighting the nontrivial nature of generalizing an algorithm for nonstationary Markov games to a parameter-free version due to distinct objectives. They advocate a black box approach for nonstationary games and subsequently analyze the algorithm for both known and unknown nonstationary budgets.\n\nFor the purposes of this study, the authors define epsilon-approximate Nash equilibrium, coarse correlated equilibrium, and correlated equilibrium using the gap between the value function given a policy. Regret over T is then defined as the summation of the gap given a policy.\n\nThe proposed method initially considers black box oracles capable of learning and testing equilibrium in near-stationary environments. The learning equilibrium oracle requires the fulfillment of assumption 1, where access to an oracle outputting a good EQ policy within C_1 samples is available. The test equilibrium oracle assumes access to an oracle that outputs False when a policy is not a good EQ policy and True when the policy is good EQ.\n\nIn the warm-up section, the authors present a MARL algorithm (Algorithm 1) for nonstationary environments with a known nonstationary budget. Regret bounds, depending on the bases, are achieved by setting rounds of each phase and the value of epsilon with a nonstationary budget, as detailed in Corollary 1.\n\nIn the subsequent section, the authors address the case of an unknown nonstationary budget. In this scenario, a testing oracle is required, which can be constructed from Protocol 1 using a learning oracle. They propose Algorithm 2, comprising learning EQ, testing EQ, and a meta-algorithm, achieving regret bounds as detailed in Theorem 1 and 2."

The authors propose to quantify the degree to which the game changes at each iteration using a total variation-inspired quantity. They show that since standard algorithms already provide regret bounds that scale reasonably even under non-stationarity bounded by this TV quantity, one can simply use the algorithms and creatively reset them whenever the non-stationarity has become too great (since between resets, the algorithms are expected to already handle the bounded amount of non-stationarity). The main technical ingredients the authors use is 1) a testing schedule that efficiently tests for non-stationarity to determine when resets should happen and 2) algorithms that test whether joint strategies constitute equilibria by reducing to single-agent learning problems."

As a fairly pessimistic quantity, the claimed bounds' dependences on $\\Delta$ also seem reasonable.

Taking that into account, all of the regret bounds for multi-round games displayed in Table 1 look like they should scale linearly or superlinearly in horizon length and linearly in state size for general-sum Markov games and the square-root of state-size for zero-sum games. It seems one could get a similar regret bound (maybe even of order $O(\\sqrt{T})$) by just flattening each game into a single round game with $H \\times S \\times A$ actions and having each player run Exp3 on those actions? The results in Table 1 could still be really interesting, but its difficult to put them into perspective because their main feature is $\\Delta$, which the authors seem to be proposing the use of. It would be helpful if the author could clarify if $\\Delta$ is already a commonly used quantity that is known to be small in practice.\n* I'm not familiar with restarting-based algorithms so I find it harder to evaluate the novelty/significance of the results in 5.2 and 5.3. However, the contributions listed in 5.1, namely the reduction of equilibria testing to single agent learning, are---to the best of my knowledge---already known (in the case of CCE testing) or very direct in the sense that its a one-two sentence reduction and the first thing one would try (in the case of CE).\n* The notation in the paper is a bit difficult to read in certain cases.

As mentioned previously, it seems like a very pessimistic quantity (as one would expect from a TV-like quantity) scaling linearly in # of states * # of players * # of actions * horizon.\n* Why do online learning algorithms fail in this setting because of bandit feedback? Its not obvious why bandit/semi-bandit algorithms that give regret bounds even for adaptive adversaries are not applicable in this setting. In fact, a bounded total variation non-stationarity budget seems like it would also imply that the second-order regret bounds of online learning algorithms should be small in this setting.\n* Are the first 5 columns of Table 1 referring to single-timestep games?\n* Is there a reason the terminology alternates between \"Protocol\" and \"Algorithm\"?\n* Typo on page 6: chanllanges -> challenges, page 5: For simplicity, We -> For simplicity, we."
