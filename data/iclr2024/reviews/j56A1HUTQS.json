                "value": "The authors question whether a GNN model with both scalability and expressivity in learning graph information exists, and propose to use a new message-passing paradigm based on hub labeling. The proposed paradigm only maintains the message-passing between core nodes and their corresponding fringe, which reduces the amount of message-passing operation in regular GNN, while cover all information in the graph. Experimental results show that the method is comparable to existing approach."

                "value": "The motivation and intuition behind the hud labeling based message-passing is well explained. Overall, the paper is easy to follow with informative illustrations highlighting the proposed methods against existing approaches. \n\nThis approach significantly reduces message-passing operations required for distant nodes to read information from each other.\n\nThe approach seems well-attuned to large graphs, and experimental results show that the approach is promising compared to existing ones that potentially require more computations."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The message passing is only between the core and fringe, meaning that none of the local structural information is kept. However, these structures are very important for some applications (including molecular graphs which are the main targets of the work).\n\n- While the performance is on par with the existing approaches, CFGNN is not the clear winner. This is fine, as I believe the key contribution is that CFGNN requires much less computation resources. However, no experimental results verify the claim. (Except transformer model OOM on some datasets that CFGNN can process)\n\n- The hub labeling process is not coupled with the learning process, meaning that the core/fringe assignment can be irrelevant to the actual learning task, which potentially cause the model to ignore information.\n\n- While using the hub core nodes to aggregate information seems natural, it could be detrimental. For example, supernodes exist in the graph. Then, at the end of the message passing, all nodes will have very similar embedding as their messages are all from supernodes. In such cases, node embeddings will be substantially over-smoothed. In contrast, a regular GNN, because every node keeps local connectivity and has message from non-supernodes, is less affected."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- How do the actual core nodes look like? Are they supernodes? If they possess similar properties across different datasets, then is it valid to use the same tool to choose core nodes for different data?\n\n- Why do transformer models cause OOM? If you shrink the batch size, you should still be able to train the model.\n\nAlso, weaknesses mentioned above."

I believe this would hurt CFGNN's performance given sufficient data to learn the hub labeling.\n- There have been several related works addressing receptive fields of GNNs, which are not compared against: Graph U-Net[1], Deeper GNNs[2], Multihop GNNs[3].\n- As a suggestion, I implore the authors to look more into how indexing can improve the scalability of their approach over said existing techniques. However, I believe more explanation and experiments are needed to distinguish this work from others in this aspect.\n\n2) Experiments\n- There are GNN baselines [1,2,3] that address the receptive fields issue, which the authors do not compare against.\n- The authors do not compare against scalable deep GNN techniques such as sampling[4,5] or distillation[6].\n- Given CFGNN tradeoffs the expressive power of graph transformers for increased scalability, the paper lacks scalability studies between CFGNN and Graphnormer, which would clarify when one should be used over the other.\n- I am unsure what the * mean?\n- There is a lack of ablation study (ex. alternatives to hub labeling for choice in core nodes, how many hub nodes?, etc.)\n\n3) Writing\n- I am unsure of the hub labeling notation: what is the difference between c and v in \"L(c) and L(v)\" in the section \"HL-based core-fringe structure\"?\n- Sections 2.1 and 2.2 could be shortened. Much of the discussion in these sections are well-known (definition of receptive field, linear scalability of receptive field and layer count, and neighborhood definitions of transformers). I appreciate the author's description of these concepts, but believe this section can be greatly shortened to leave more space for the author's own proposals.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Graph U-Nets (ICML2019)\n\n[2] Towards Deeper Graph Neural Networks (KDD2020)\n\n[3] Multi-hop Attention Graph Neural Network (IJCAI2021)\n\n[4] Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs (NeurIPS2017)\n\n[5] Training Graph Neural Networks with 1000 Layers (ICML2021)\n\n[6] Graph-less Neural Networks: Teaching Old MLPs New Tricks Via Distillation (ICLR2022)"
