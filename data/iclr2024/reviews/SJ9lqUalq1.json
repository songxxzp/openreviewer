In fact, only the case of rank-2 order-3 model is considered. Emphasis is placed on the so-called non-orthogonal case when the components are correlated. For this case, the paper propose an algorithm containing the parameter $\\gamma$ for the sequential construction of the desired decomposition. This parameter $\\gamma$ is chosen adaptively by repeatedly running the algorithm. Asymptotics of the decomposition parameters are given as a theoretical analysis. A small number of numerical examples on synthetic data are given."

In general, experimental section 4 is very short, subsections 4.2 and 4.3 consist of only figures. Thus, it is not clear at all the relevance of this paper, where practically the presented results can be applied.\n\n- Neither is there any comparison with other existing methods.\n\n- Only rank-2 order-3 model is considered, which significantly reduces the breadth of application of the method and, as a consequence, its practical value."

In a matrix scenario (order = 2) this method is rather straightforward, because singular vectors are orthogonal. In tensors (order >=3) orthogonality is not always satisfied. This makes deflation more challenging. This is the topic the paper addresses. The paper treats the case order=3, rank=2 in details and outlines the schema for higher order and ranks."
