Data Quality: While mining information from monomer data might provide more data for multimer contact prediction, the synthesized data might not be as accurate as genuine multimeric structural data. This could lead to instability in model training or inaccuracies in prediction.\n\n2. Challenges with Transfer Learning: While pre-training methods like SMP can leverage monomer data, the transfer from monomers to multimers might not always be seamless. This means that features in monomer data might not entirely correspond with those in multimer data.\n\n3. Computational Complexity: Splitting and merging data could add to computational complexity, especially when dealing with large-scale protein datasets.\n\n4. Issues with Experimental Validation: Due to the relative scarcity of genuine multimeric structural data, it might be challenging to adequately validate the model's performance. This might lead to overfitting or an over-reliance on synthesized data.\n\n5. Structural Diversity: The diversity of protein multimeric structures might exceed what monomer data can provide, possibly limiting the model's generalization capability.\n\n6. Other Biological Limitations: Biologically, not all monomers can simply be split and merged to simulate multimeric structures. Some proteins are highly specific in structure and function, which might impact prediction accuracy.\n\n7. Usually, structural changes accompany the polymerization of polypeptide chains to form multimers, and the interaction between them should be distinct from the folding of single chains. In this premise, the effect remains, and the pre-training is surprisingly effective. The article lacks a discussion of this phenomenon."

In my opinion, using DIPS-plus data for testing is not appropriate, since the unbound structures are not available.  It is a highly valuable resource for training and validation.  Your results demonstrate how much more difficult this task is, and makes me question the value of the evaluation over the DIPS-plus and CASP-CAPRI datasets.  It also demonstrates that we are still very far from being able to accurately predict inter-chain contacts in a realistic scenario.\n\n- The single chain proteins are split by cutting the sequence into two.  Another option would be to cluster the monomer into two clusters and use those as the proxy interacting chains.  This might give rise to more \"natural\" splitting of the initial monomer.  Can you comment on that?\n\n- There is a potential concern for information leakage if the monomer data contains structures that are similar to the trained complexes.  I don't think that is a concern, since the monomer data does not contain information about the labels; infact, I would be curious to know whether allowing the model to learn from the monomers in a complex helps improve performance.\n\n- The performance advantage for EquiDock is unclear, as the results using SMP are slightly worse than the EquiDock published results, but comparable to the result when they ran it.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n\"However, due to the small scale of existing multimer data, current models are less accurate in protein inter-chain contact prediction.\"\nLess accurate than existing methods?  AlphaFold-multimer will definitely be less accurate than its monomeric counterpart as complex structure prediction is a more difficult problem.\n\n\"Due to the ID numbers of monomer and multimer in PDB being different, there is no overlap between pseudo multimer and real multimer data.\"  One is composed of multi-chain complexes, and the other is composed of single chains, so no overlap is possible by construction.  However, the chains in the multi-chain complex data, can potentially appear in the single chain dataset.  However, I don't consider that an issue.\n\n\"we all use HHBlits (Remmert et al., 2012) with Uniclust30 (Mirdita et al., 2017) database for MSA, and PSAIA (Mihel et al., 2008) to calculate geometric features.\"  what do you mean by geometric features?\n\nPlease define the metric you use (e.g. P @ L/5).  Are those numbers in percentages?\n\n\"After filtering extreme data, such as too long, too short sequences and high relative data with other datasets,\"  Please define \"high relative data...\" Did you mean sequence similarity to other datasets?  The threshold used to define that is important.  Also, I can understand why you wouldn't want to include very short sequences, but why remove long ones?\n\"filtering the overlap between the original CASP-CAPRI data and the DIPS-Plus.\" - please explain how overlap was computed.\n\nFigure 3 is very difficult to read.\n\nhomologous multimer --> homomultimer\n\nheterologous multimer --> heteromultimer"
