CVPR 2022 and Karras et al. NeuIPS 2022), their model architecture is two-folds:\n- a transformer-based \\beta-VAE to embedd tabular data into a latent space\n- a score-based generator based on (Song et al. ICLR 2021)'s architecture\n\nAs a slight algorithmic contributions, the authors propose to use an \"adaptive VAE loss weighing\".\n\nIn the experiment section, the method is benchmarked against 6 state of the art tabular data generation models on 6 datasets. A few ablation tests are provided (one to justify the adaptive weighing).\nThis paper is only focused on unconditional generation, some experiments on missing-values imputation are also provided.\n\nIt is worth noting that both the code and a rich appendix are provided as supplementary material.\nThe code is clear and well commented.\nThe appendix provides a clear background on recent score-based generation best-practices and several supplementary experiments. Several implementation and methodology details allows the readers to retrieve what they needs to reproduce and understand this work."

Notably, the study employs a comprehensive set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for the generated data, filling a gap often observed in previous research. The proposed method excels across these metrics, underscoring its efficacy in generating synthetic data that closely mirrors the original data distribution."

It would be beneficial to compare the outcomes between optimally and sub-optimally trained VAEs, providing insights into worst-case vs. best-case scenarios.\n\n- Given the generative capability of VAEs, it would be insightful to see results from data generated solely by the VAE used in this study. The distinction between the paper's transformer-based VAE and TVAE warrants further exploration to determine the independent efficacy of the former.\n\n- While adjusting default hyperparameters for a fair comparison is commendable, understanding performance under default settings across consistent training epochs would give a fuller picture. This would ascertain whether hyperparameter enlargement (as done for CTGAN and CoDi) equally benefits the models or favors the presented method disproportionately.\n\n- The discrepancy observed where TabDDPM struggles with the News dataset (poor performance in Table 1), yet exhibits a low error rate in Table 2 seems unintuitive. Additionally, given TabDDPM's consistent second-place ranking, except for the News dataset, its fourth-place average rank seems unfair. An alternative could be per-dataset ranking or reporting modal / averaged ranks. \n\n- Given that the News dataset is primarily of numeric nature, it seems counterintuitive that TabDDPM, a diffusion based model would underperform on this dataset. It would be beneficial to understand the authors' rationale behind the model's inability to generate meaningful content for this dataset.\n\n- The deployment of MLE as a metric for privacy is unconventional. Traditionally, MLE assesses the synthetic data's task-performance equivalence to real data, not privacy leakage. It would be enriching if the authors could shed light on this choice.\n\n\nOverall, this paper stands out for its meticulous code, articulate presentation, and thorough analysis. I commend the authors for their contribution."

                "value": "Thank you for sharing your code with the community; it's a valuable resource. While exploring it, I encountered a few queries and points of feedback:\n\n1. **Device Attribute Error**: When executing the command `python main.py \u2014dataname adult \u2014method vae \u2014mode train`, I came across the \u201cAttributeError: \u2019Namespace\u2019 object has no attribute \u2018device\u2019\u201d. I was able to address this by introducing an else statement post line 7 in `main.py` to default to 'cpu'. Consider incorporating this for broader compatibility.\n   ```python\n   if \u2026:\n       args.device = \u2026\n   else:\n       args.device = 'cpu'\n   ```\n\n2. **Sample Size Limitation**: I attempted the VAE training phase with 40 samples and encountered an `IndexError: index out of range in self`. This wasn't an issue with the full sample size of 32561. Is the model designed to accommodate only larger samples, or is there a potential to adapt it to smaller sample sizes?\n\n3. **Epoch Setting for VAE Model**: The default epoch for the VAE model in the code is set to 4000. Based on my prior experiences with the TVAE model using CTGAN's code, training for around 300 epochs usually suffices. Is the transformer architecture inherently more demanding in terms of training duration? Additionally, what criteria do you rely on to determine the termination of training? Introducing an early stopping mechanism might be beneficial, especially considering the subsequent training phase for the diffusion model. It's also noteworthy that a Train/Val accuracy of 100% seems achievable by the 1000th epoch."
