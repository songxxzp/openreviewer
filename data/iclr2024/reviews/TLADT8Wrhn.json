The authors timestamp the training data spanning 2014-2022, treating each timestamp as a distinct incremental learning step. Their analysis delves into the backward and forward compatibility of CLIP as it undergoes training, leading to some findings.\n\nFirstly, the research demonstrates that employing simple small replay techniques effectively mitigate forgetfulness, an insight in the context of continual learning. Secondly, the study reveals an unsurprising yet noteworthy performance gap: CLIP underperforms on future, unseen data."

The challenge lies in the impracticality of re-training large foundation models like ChatGPT or CLIP, highlighting the necessity for continual learning solutions. Despite this urgency, there's a notable absence of organized datasets for the community to tackle this problem. While the CLEAR benchmark exists, it has not gained traction and lacks essential components like Web captions. This benchmark, being a captioned version of CLEAR that evolves over time, fills a gap, offering a valuable resource for researchers in the continual learning domain.\n\nS2:\nThe authors conduct insightful analyses using fundamental regularization and replay techniques. Unsurprisingly, the results show that preserving and replaying a portion of the data during incremental learning effectively mitigates forgetfulness. This empirical validation underscores the importance of such techniques in preserving model performance over time, providing a practical and valuable contribution to the field.\n\nS3:\nThe paper's central discussion on the fine-tuning cost in terms of compute MAC carries some value. This perspective equips researchers with a framework to explore low MAC solutions, emphasizing a nuanced approach rather than blindly minimizing the forget ratio."

Including these comparisons would have provided a more comprehensive evaluation, highlighting the benchmark's effectiveness in contrast to existing state-of-the-art approaches.\n\nW2: No fine-tuning, only pre-training\n\nAn additional area of improvement lies in the paper's scope, particularly concerning the fine-tuning stage. While the study adeptly focuses on the continual pre-training phase, it would have been more insightful and impactful to extend the analysis to the fine-tuning stage. Specifically, investigating how well the obtained checkpoint at a given time transfers to standard vision benchmarks, beyond simple retrieval tasks, would have provided a more nuanced understanding of the model's performance. This consideration is essential for gauging the real-world applicability and adaptability of the continual learning approach outlined in the paper.\n\n\n[1] Preventing Zero-Shot Transfer Degradation in Continual Learning of Vision-Language Models\n\n[2] Robust fine-tuning of zero-shot models"

Why is this the case?\n\nW1.2): Fig1 (mid) and Figure 10 present a different picture than Table 2.\n- Comparing backward transfer retrieval to ID performance for Cumulative exp (oracle) in Table 2\n    - Intuitively, ID performance should be higher (equal). \n- To what degree is the drop in forward transfer attributable to tasks getting harder vis-a-vis encountering new distributions.\n\nHypothesis: Past tasks are easier! Can the authors help shed some light on why the difference?\n\nW2) **Major results simply not present** [Critical]\n\nI cannot find any results for LAIONNet-like dynamic classification task. Did I miss something?\n\nOther missing ablations:\n- a) \u201cSame maximum LR works best across all runs when using cosine schedule\u201d \u2013 Didn't find supporting evidence.\n- b) \u201cWarm up helps training on data from the first time step, but hurts on subsequent time steps.\u201d \u2013 After correcting the minor shift issue, the table seems to robustly support the opposite conclusion. This seems surprising to me! I would have not expected warmup to help as the init is a very good one. Warmup mostly mitigates over-updating to high gradients when starting from a poor (random) init in my view.\n- c) \u201cGiven a fixed buffer size for each past step, we observe minimal to no difference between random subsampling and other strategies.\u201d \u2013 Didn't find supporting evidence.\n\nW3) **Serious Design Flaws in Continual Learning Setup** [Critical]\n\nW3.1) *4-7 timesteps are too few*\n- I am worried the major findings would significantly change when tested on 20/50 timesteps but with the same computational cost per timestep, as the streams become far more non-i.i.d in that case. \n- Why? Because of memory buffers become far smaller, that it becomes very hard in my experience to bridge the gap between CL methods and -all. \n- Similarly, I am concerned there will be a far larger gap between -all and Oracle. \n\nThis critically affects some of the core findings presented in this work.\n\nW3.2) *Is memory constrained?*\n- For TiC-RedCaps and TiC-YFCC15M, all and exp/equal only differ at last timestep (Until timestep 3, they all can store all the data). This grossly undermines the comparisons as even at the last timestep, they still store 2/3rd of the data. It is very surprising that the difference in training for timestep causes such a big gap! If this is caused by D/3 data missing at the last timestep, the findings given 20-50 will probably be quite different!   \n- This issue is mitigated in TiC-DataComp as at last timestep, equal would store D/3 samples per timestep (2D/6D) which is indeed much  smaller! (Minor note: Am I correct that buffer conserved here is 2.3x smaller, not the claimed 3.5x smaller? -- The replay+current is 3D/7D). \n\nW3.3) *Replay buffers not utilized effectively, computation implicitly constrains memory.*\n- I worry most of the decline in performance is due to random sampling, and hence wanted to see supporting evidence for W2.c). I make my case below:\n- *Why?* This seems to be a case of imbalance data across timesteps due to the buffer constraints. \n   - If trained without oversampling less-represented data, I am not surprised to see a bias against replay data (i.e. poor backward transfer). \n- *Why not data loss constraining replayable sample?* I focus on TiC-Datacomp because there is a significant gap in replay buffers here\n   - In TiC-Datacomp-medium, 35k iterations with 4096 samples barely allows ~1 pass through the 128M samples.\n   - Hence, there seems to be a far stronger implicit memory constraint, as even after storing kD samples at timestep k, the network can only pass through 1/k fraction of samples from each past timestep at timestep k (training with oversampling). \n   - Given a fixed buffer size, retaining equal samples of past data still stores 2/(k-1) samples which is far higher than the limitation introduced by computational constraints. It seems possible to train on mostly unique samples, mimicking -all.\n\nHence, the gap in performance between -equal and -all should have been minimal (which seems like a serious design issue-- alleviated by far smaller buffers in the 20-50 timestep setup discussed above). However, the fact that gap still exists seems to compound the issue, and I worry it is due to poor sampling.\n\nW4) **Little discussion of past work despite similar findings/parallels** [Important]\n\nAlthough I fully admit the dominant setups in CL are quite synthetic and need improvement, as correctly pointed out by the authors.\n- (Cai et al., 2021) also has analysis covering several aspects of interest here, e.g. YFCC distribution shift plot (see their Fig 2), learning rate modulation, comparing impacts of replay buffer, web-scale training and similar compute constraints as here but on 600K timesteps. This avoids promoting CL methods which work only on a short timescale and degrade quickly when scaled beyond 5-20 timesteps (i.e. my worry about the 4-7 timesteps). \n- Finding (1) on Imagenet IID seems out-of-place here, and has detailed precisely in several works, e.g. \u201cComputationally Budgeted Continual Learning: What Does Matter?\u201d, CVPR23. Other works like \u201cOne Pass ImageNet\u201d NeurIPS-W 2021 have analysis on Sequential/Cumulative variants as discussed here on Imagenet but these papers are not discussed.\n- Other works which have interesting investigations with computational limits (Bornschein et al., 2022) and (Jang et al., 2022) have nice analysis quite relevant to this work. E.g. hyperparamter optimization as a cost in the compute budget C (will be required when training in the unknown)"

And they use their benchmarks to curate various dynamic valuations to measure temporal robustness of existing models."

It may be more representative to explore newer datasets for the research."

            "questions": {
                "value": "The fundamental issue of continual learning is catastrophic forgetting. If we fine-tune a small number of parameters (e.g., prompt tuning) in the CLIP model, is catastrophic forgetting a major concern? On the other hand, if we fine-tune a large number of parameters, resource limitations may become a factor. Therefore, from this perspective, is it necessary to construct such benchmarks?"
