However, it is possible that the bias in the association is so strong (due to insufficient or biased training data) that the model could not generate the correct image, despite being asked for a specific property. For example, if there are no female plumbers in the training set, the model may not be able to generate the specified image even if \"female plumbers\" are explicitly asked for in the prompt. Since the method only trains a linear projection head, it is unlikely to be able to generate unbiased images.\n* The method relies on a set of predefined sensitive keywords to enable transformation. However, it is hard to make this set of keywords exhaustive, and since this is a matching-based method, the checks may be skipped if some typos are introduced.\n* The fair mapping method proposed by the work may lead to loss of details in the prompt, when compared with its baselines, as shown in Sec 4.4 that some facial expressions are not generated according to the text prompts."

                "value": "The paper discusses the problem of demographic bias in text-to-image diffusion models, which often produce biased images due to sociocultural biases in language. The authors propose a solution called \"Fair Mapping,\" which is a model-agnostic and efficient method that modifies pre-trained text-to-image models to generate fair images. This is achieved by adding a linear mapping network that updates a small number of parameters, thus reducing computational costs and speeding up the optimization process."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. This paper only considers bias within text embeddings and does not extend to biases that may be inherent in the diffusion model itself. This limitation is significant as it suggests that the system could be susceptible to manipulation if the text embedding model is altered. A more holistic approach that also scrutinizes and corrects for biases within the diffusion model could potentially offer a more robust and less vulnerable solution.\n2. The experiments are limited to biases related to gender and race, omitting other prevalent societal biases such as ageism, socioeconomic status and religious discrimination."
