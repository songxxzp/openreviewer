To the best of my understanding, the concept of dynamics should have something to do with time and is usually used to indicate a temporally changing variable. Here in this paper, I do not see the conformation of a target protein changes with time. Instead, this paper cares more about different candidates of stable conformations. The proposed forward-backward process seems like a dynamics but essentially is a process of heating-then-simulated-annealing, which is different from the dynamics of protein conformation. Please properly modify some statements, especially those regarding dynamics.\n- How similar are the 12 proteins in the benchmark to the training protein data? Need to ensure zero-shot by quantifying the dissimilarity of train/test proteins at sequence and structure levels."

Maybe you can just turn off the rotation loss. I am curious whether frames are essential for accurate protein conformation sampling.\n\n- From Appendix >> Inference Stage on page 22, the ensemble structures is obtained by merging samples from each perturbation scale, in total 1,000 conformations for fast-folding proteins. It is surprising that metrics such as JS-PwD/MAE-TM remains so small even though $T_{\\delta}$ can be as large as 0.7. I expect that many samples are quite different from the starting conformation, especially for large $T_{\\delta}$. Could you please explain this behavior?\n\n- Since the model is sequence-agnostic, the model should sample many \"outlier\" conformations, which is not accessible from the given protein sequence. In Fig. S5, are most of the shown structures valid conformations for each protein system?\n\n- Page 18, I do not understand why reweighting could not help improve relevant distributional metrics. Does that mean the model likelihood estimation is not accurate, or model diversity originates from model uncertainty? Quick check, if we manually make $\\log p_{X}$ a constant value across all samples, would it improve the metrics?\n\n- Would you mind showing model performance on the apo/holo dataset for a fair comparison with EigenFold?\n\n- Could you please (1) provide the source code in supplementary materials; (2) make the benchmark data open-access for reproducibility?"

Rather than sampling the entire structure at once, the authors reformulate the task into multiple conditional sampling tasks. The backbone is generated conditioned on a ground truth conformation. The backbone and ground truth conformation are used to then generate the side chains and carbonyl oxygen on the backbone. The authors present an updated implementation of the invariant point attention from AlphaFold and show that their confirmation sampling process is SE(3) equivariant.

The suggested technique utilizes the ESMFold protein embeddings and trains an equivariant denoising diffusion model using samples from the Protein Data Bank, predominantly featuring single folded states (i.e., absolute minima of the equilibrium distribution). During the testing phase, the model diffuses to a specified noise level, partially erasing the protein structure but not entirely, and then it denoises it again, resulting in a different protein conformation. This translation from one structure to another is employed to sample different conformations, starting from the folded structure. The method's effectiveness is assessed using various metrics such as validity (defined as the non-clash) fidelity (defined as the JS between reference and samples TICA distributions) and Diversity.

                "value": "1)\nThe core part of the proposal of this method is described in 3.2 (forward-backward Dynamcis) where I think a more elaborate explanation could be done here.\n\nFor example, when sampling a conformation T ~ p(T | x_0), is x_0 consistently the initiating folded structure, or could it be a T derived from a preceding sampling step?  This is not clear to me from the text. I imagine that if setting it always to the folded structure it would bias the distribution to the minima. Could the authors provide a more precise description of this in the method section?\n\n2)\nIn section 3.1, could the authors provide more details, or cite relevant literature, explaining how the side chain atoms are derived from the backbone atoms?\n\n3)\nIn the following sentence \"Empirically, increasing T_delta leads to enhanced diversity yet it may hurt exploitation by demanding more reverse steps\".\n\nIs this true for any T_delta value? I would suspect that if T_delta goes to a large enough amount of noise (reaching the gaussian distribution), the result would be equivalent sampling from the trained PDB distribution, resulting again in sampling from the folded minima instead of a diverse equilibrium dataset.\n\n4) In section 3.2 (Score Network architecture), the authors indicate that there have been minor modifications to IPA to include pair representations with edge layers. Could the authors provide more context as to why this is necessary and not arbitrary?\n\n5) In Appenix B, Algorithm 2\nHow is the algorithm returning x_0? Based on the paper wasn't x_0 the starting point?\n\n6) Better interpretation on why the method works:\nGiven that the model is optimized on the PDB dataset, we would expect it to only learn the PDB landscape. However when degenerating the process with the proposed approach it actually learns to generate samples close to the equilibrium distribution. Because it never had access to a Force Field and only to the folded state it is quite surprising it is able to \"make up\" that information. Could it be this is only possible because of the ESMFold embeddings? I.e. do these embeddings contain information about the protein landscape beyond the folded structure, and then are you recovering that information present in the ESMFold embeddings with the proposed method? It would be interesting to know the authors interpretation about this."
