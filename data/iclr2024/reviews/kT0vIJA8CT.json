In my understanding, the cartpole environment uses 3 seeds (which is not enough for RL), but the Atari environments seem to use only one seed (and treat the seed as a tunable hyperparameter?). This is a cause for concern regarding the replicability and generalization of the proposed method. In addition, it means it is basically impossible to tell if the results about using a regularizer or soft output are significant. The mean and standard deviation across random seeds for each experiment should be reported.\n\nWeakness 2 (Major): The inability to interpret the decision for breakout is a bit worrying. I think this is an important result that should be discussed in the main paper for clarity.\n\nWeakness 3 (Minor): The synthetic trace method could be explained better, as it seems to be a key part of allowing interpretability in complex environments. But it is only introduced in the experiments section. This makes the experiment section a bit hard to follow. I think that introducing this in the methodology section would make more sense."

Does it reduce complexity, etc.  The author also does not explain how to determine the structure of those trees. Do those trees grow like XGBoost trees?
