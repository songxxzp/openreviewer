Technically, this work is a simple extension to the GradCAM-based one by replacing GradCAM with LayerCAM, which is proposed in the previous work. More importantly, why this method is used instead of another CAM method seems to need to be analyzed.\n3. Missing important experiments. Firstly, the author should evaluate the proposed method under different trigger patterns, especially those scattered ones and those not located in the center of the bounding box.\n4. There is no discussion about the resistance to potential adaptive attacks. What if the attackers know this defense? Can they design an adaptive method to bypass this defense easily?"

It would be better and necessary to provide a more in-depth description and explanation of why this assumption is sound. For example, you could discuss the main constraints that limit the application of backdoor attacks in the physical world. I found this assumption somehow confusing, as it suggests that a backdoored sample with a pixel-level trigger can still be printed and placed in the physical world.\n\n- The performance of LeBD in the digital world\n\nIn Table 1, although the discussion explains that \"In the physical world, affected by the shooting angle, light, and so on\", photographed triggers are more vulnerable to defenses, the performance gaps of the proposed LeBD and CA-LeBD between the digital world and the physical world are still much larger than those observed in benchmarks. It appears that the performance of the proposed approach is highly influenced by the strength of backdoor attacks, with weak triggers leading to more significant performance improvements. Please provide more discussion on this point. Another concern is, the experiments in digital world scenario only involves the same backdoor attack in the physical world scenario, however, there are more attacks can be applied in the digital world, as described in previous sections. \n\n- The application scenario of CA-LeBD\n\nIn Section 5.1, it has been claimed that \"although LeBD and CA-LeBD are inferior to NEO, they are much faster than the latter\". However, according to the experimental results in Section 5.4, the runtime overhead of CA-LeBD could be several times higher than NEO (if applied to all 80 classes). Please provide more discussion on how to apply CA-LeBD in practice. For instance, how to determine the appropriate number of classes when using CA-LeBD and how it might influence the defense performance."
