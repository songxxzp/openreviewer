The Bayesian regret studied in this work is usually weaker than the frequentist regret.\n3. Algorithm 2 is under the standard Thompson sampling framework, and the posterior sampling updates seem similar to previous works, for example, [Zhu & Tan., 2020].  Are there any novel techniques in the algorithm design, or do the new results come from the analysis?\n4. There are some mistakes in the literature review. In the study of $d$-dimensional linear contextual bandits, they did not always keep the fixed variance across the arms. For example, in [Kim et al., 2022] and  [Zhao et al.,2023] mentioned in the paper, the stochastic noise at time step $k$, $\\epsilon_k$, is a random variable dependent on $\\mathcal F_k = \\sigma(x_1,\\epsilon_1,\\ldots,x_{k-1},\\epsilon_{k-1}, x_k)$ with $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_k | \\mathcal F_k] = 0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_k^2 | \\mathcal F_k] = \\sigma_k^2$.
