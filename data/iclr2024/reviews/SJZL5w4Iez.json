            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Overall, my main concern with this paper is that I didn't think it sufficiently convinced that the proposed measure of effective parameters was a good one. This was further complicated by the paper attempting to fit too many ideas/claims that were not individually investigated to their conclusion with sufficient rigor. Given that this paper attempts to provide a general-purpose measure of effective parameters with little to no limitations (a very significant claim) I cannot recommend acceptance in its current form based on the arguments and the evidence provided at this stage. However, I hope that the authors are not discouraged as there does seem to be some interesting ideas in this paper that may well result in a valuable contribution after further refinement and critical analysis. I provide my detailed critiques below. \n\nSection 2 - Methods\n* While I understand the authors were inspired by notions from thermodynamics and are using results from that field I don't understand the benefit of presenting the method in these terms. I found the reasoning of this section more challenging to follow than necessary due to the switching back and forward. It would be much clearer to simply discuss the quantities of interest in the ML setting (e.g. negative log-likelihood) and derive an expression of effective parameters from there (using results from thermodynamics when required but in the same notation to avoid switching back and forward).\n* Why is setting the Boltzmann constant to 1 a reasonable choice? This does not seem to be its true known value and therefore $N$ is not exactly $T^{-1}$. This has downstream effects by my understanding since the authors explicitly interpret the effective parameters relative to the number of parameters stating \"the learning capacity is a tiny fraction (\u223c 2%) of the total number of weights\".\n* The four bullet points attempt to argue that learning capacity is a good measure of effective parameters (I would suggest convincing the reader on this point is fundamental to the remainder of the paper). However, this is not a convincing argument in my opinion and I struggled to even understand the reasoning in some cases. For example \"[...] the learning capacity C equals half the effective number of parameters K/2.\" How do we know the true effective parameters here, this is not defined clearly? Why is H defined as it is here (this convex expression) and why should this be convincing? \n* In eqn (6) it's not clear to me that the two log terms are a good approximation for -U. The justification is just a statement that it is. Especially since in eqn (7) this approximation is assumed to be good for every data point in the distribution. Why the subtle change to N-1 in eqn (8)?\n* The rightmost equality is eqn (8) is unclear to me. Why is this an equality, I understood the LOOCV estimator was approximating something here. Could this step be spelled out further please?\n* Then in practice LOOCV is not actually used, k-fold is used instead. There is no analysis of the effect of increasing the value of k. This is another approximation being introduced that requires further consideration.  \n* The process described at the start of Sec 2.2 (sampling datasets, cross-validation, etc.) should be described as a formal algorithm somewhere.\n* The authors report taking 4 bootstrap samples of the data. What exactly is this intended to approximate? Is this supposed to account for the $\\mathbb{E}_{x,y \\sim P}$?\n* At this point it's not entirely clear to me what calculating $\\bar{C} = - N^2 \\nabla_N \\bar{U}$ means exactly. Are you trying to take the gradient of eqn (9) wrt the number of samples N? \n* \"we used a polynomial mode\" - Initially thought the authors meant that the underlying model was polynomial (which it technically could be since its a single hidden layer MLP). They should specify that they are referring to a model being fit to U and C values.\n* \"this procedure also gives an estimate of the uncertainty\" - These estimates are unlikely to be valid I would imagine since the observations are not independent. \n* It's claimed that the method \"works reasonably well (Fig 1)\". How can we tell this is working well from these figures? We don't have a ground truth so presumably this means it produces a shape that the authors hoped? This seems like a weak evaluation. \n* \"We therefore fit a sigmoid [...]\" - Does this not undermine the fourth contribution of the paper that \"The learning capacity saturates for very small (equivalent to high temperature) and very large (equivalent to low temperature) sample sizes N .\" Since you are effectively enforcing this by modeling it as a sigmoid?\n\nSection 3 - Connection to PAC-Bayesian framework\n* While the idea of making this connection to the PAC-Bayesian framework is interesting, I found the execution could have been made more clear. I think this section could have benefitted from a more formal presentation of the equivalence (e.g. a theorem). As with the previous section, including all theory as part of a long discussion section with extensive notation and several steps being insufficiently explicit harms the paper as a whole. I found it difficult to judge just how strong the connection claimed in this section really is. \n\nSection 4 - Experiments\n* Even setting aside my aforementioned concerns with a proposed measure of effective dimensionality, I am skeptical that the actual raw value rather than the relative values it outputs should be considered accurate. Comparing this value to the actual number of parameters seems problematic given the number of approximations taken in its estimation. \n* The authors mention that this low effective parameter count is consistent with other aspects of the literature e.g. distillation. This would seem to be a testable hypothesis. If we trained a large model with a given effective parameter count and nearly perfectly distill it into a much smaller model, the number of effective parameters should remain constant or decrease very slightly. \n* Without being convinced by the underlying measures U and C, the results in Table 1 are insufficiently granular to convince the reader of the effectiveness of these measures. I also find it surprising that regularization wasn't a primary consideration in attempting to validate the metrics. \n* It seems that the general intention of these experiments is to investigate the effective parameters of models, datasets, etc. assuming we have a valid measure of effective parameters. I think the overarching problem is that the proposed measure may not be a good choice.\n* I found the double descent results in Sec 3.2 suggested issues with the proposed measure. Firstly, I don't see a double descent shape in the LHS plot. Then the right-hand plot seems (a) extremely noisy and (b) does not capture the correct U-shape that we would expect if it was working as we would hope. This seems to me to provide evidence that the measure is _not_ working effectively. \n* In Sec 3.3 and Fig 4, in contrast to the authors, I would find it hard to conclude that there is a particularly strong connection based on the results provided in the plot. I also find it hard to believe that the Pearson Correlation between the solid and dashed green lines is 0.99 based on visual inspection. \n* No code was provided to inspect the experiments performed in more detail. \n\nSection 5 - Related work\n* The related work section seemed to miss all of the existing work of effective parameters, largely from the statistical learning literature from where the concept emerged to the best of my knowledge. See e.g. [1] for a recent attempt in the deep learning context or [2] for a general overview of the concept across various traditional learning models. \n\nMinor\n* Using asterisk symbols for footnotes should be avoided since this symbol is also used in the mathematical notation. I would suggest sticking to the standard approach of numbering footnotes.\n* The style guide paragraph spacing seems to have been removed to fit more content into the paper. This negatively affects the readability of the work. \n\nFinally, I would briefly note that some of the issues I have raised were also included by the authors in the Q&A section of App F. Specifically (a) \"How can you justify the definition of the learning capacity?\" and (b) \"This paper is difficult to understand\". I didn't find the answers provided have resolved these issues. For (a), I don't think this is a self-evidently good measure as the authors imply. For (b), while I appreciate that expressing complex ideas and connections can be challenging, it must be done to a sufficient level to convince the reader of the claims being made even so. \n\n\n[1] Maddox, W.

They use this method to conduct experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, WikiText-2, and a synthetic example to examine the links between the learning capacity and test accuracy.

In addition, I found it hard to understand the link between the regime of validity of the theory and how it relates to the experiments.\n\nOne key difference between the thermodynamics partition function and this classifier partition function is that in thermodynamics, temperature and the number of terms are independent; in this analysis, the number of terms (data points) is exactly equal to the temperature. Indeed, in thermodynamics one takes N (or an equivalent quantity) to infinity, and the temperature emerges as a scale-independent constant. This fact should be present in the discussion of the analogy.\n\nI think there's something wrong with the analysis of the learning capacity for quadratic energy; by my calculations, this quantity is related to the determinant of the matrix A (from the theory of multivariate Gaussian integrals) - not simply half the dimension $p/2$ as stated in the text. Indeed, in the same paragraph there is a formula given which depends on the spectrum of A, which is in contradiction to the estimate $p/2$ and the determinant form.\n\nI also struggled to understand the link between the theoretical analysis, which involved a data-independent prior on the weight space and a dataset-induced probability distribution over weight space, and the experimental analysis, which involved looking at trained networks (that is, highly data-conditioned distributions on the weight space).\n\nThe analysis in Table 1 is far from convincing. On the real networks, the hypothesis doesn't hold for 1 out of the 3 examples. Each example itself consists of two datapoints. This does not give enough statistical power to resolve questions about the correlation between the capacity and the accuracy. In addition, the experiments showing that capacity doesn't show double descent behavior are not convincing as well; see questions.\n\nOverall I don't think the authors have established the utility of their definition for capacity; the comparisons to other measures of capacity are a good start, but I think more careful experiments are needed to convincingly show that this is a quantity worth further study.\n\nMaybe a better framing would involve just experimental results, empirically modeling the relationship between loss/accuracy and number of datapoints. As it currently stands, there is a big gap between the theory and experiments which makes the paper confusing to read and makes me doubt some of the conclusions."

Thus, it is unsurprising, that this quantity correlates well with test loss.  \nMoreover, it is costly to compute, as multiple models need to be trained (to sample from the model distribution) for differing sizes of training data (to quantify the change of test loss with training set size). Overall, as learning capacity requires access to the testing split, it appears to be a complicated and inefficient replacement of a validation loss.\n\n2. It is argued that the estimator of learning capacity can be used to calculate a PAC-Bayes bound. (*\"Our techniques to estimate the learning capacity are computationally inexpensive ways to calculate PAC-Bayes bounds.*\") This is not true. Such a bound must account for the uncertainty in the estimate of learning capacity, however, this work does not present bounds on the quality of the estimator.\n\n3. The arguments are difficult to follow. Among others, I found the presentation of the connection between learning capacity and PAC-Bayes theory in section 2.3 rather confusing.\n\n4. When reading this paper I got the impression, that the concept of learning capacity is novel and part of the contribution. This is not the case, as learning capacity and its properties (e.g. as a measure of dimensionality) can already be found in LaMont & Wiggins (2019). The latter is cited, but a comparison is only given in the supplementary material. Instead, it should have been placed prominently in the main part, to avoid giving a wrong impression.\n\n5.

                "value": "Motivated by concepts from statistical mechanics in thermodynamics and the work of (LaMont and Wiggins, 2019), the authors propose the heat capacity (here called the learning capacity), defined as the scaled second derivative of the tempered log-marginal likelihood (or free energy), as a measure of intrinsic model dimension. It is shown empirically that learning capacity often anticorrelates with test accuracy, and that the ratio of the learning capacity to the number of model parameters is often small. A variety of smaller models are considered with a variety of standard (again, smaller) datasets. The test loss is also shown to not exhibit double descent when plotted as a function of learning capacity instead of number of model parameters. Theoretical PAC-Bayes-like arguments are presented to support a connection between the learning capacity and the test error. Behaviour of the learning capacity is examined for small and large sample sizes, showing that in either case, the learning capacity plateaus to common values, indicating diminishing returns. To estimate the learning capacity, its behaviour with respect to the sample size is parameterised using a sigmoid function. This expression is integrated to get a parameterised form of the average energy. Since the average energy can be estimated using leave-one-out cross-validation, the parameters of the sigmoid model for the learning capacity can be estimated using nonlinear least-squares fits. Another approach using MCMC is also presented. These methods do not rely on any parameterisation, so the learning capacity for non-parametric models is also investigated. The appendices also show that, asymptotically in the sample size, the learning capacity is equal to the real-log canonical threshold (RLCT) from singular learning theory."

                "value": "- Derivation of the PAC-Bayes bound could be much more rigorous than presented. The assumptions should be made clear, and the full bound provided as a theorem. \n- Theoretical arguments all rely on a non-singular Hessian, which is never the case for practical neural networks. See, for example [1].\n- Models considered are relatively small, and not nearly state-of-the-art. This can be forgiven, due to the complexities associated with estimating Bayesian quantities, but is nonetheless an issue that would need to be overcome eventually for the work to be practical. \n- While the approximation methods for the learning capacity appear to be effective, they also appear to be very expensive, requiring multiple trained models over bootstrapped versions of the datasets, or a lengthy MCMC chain.\n\n[1] Wei, S., Murfet, D., Gong, M., Li, H., Gell-Redman, J., & Quella, T.

                "value": "- Can you write a full PAC-Bayes bound involving the learning capacity under some approximating assumptions? This, together with the first listed \"weakness\", is probably my biggest gripe with the paper, and I would be happy to improve my score if the authors can show this is achievable. \n- By linearising the model akin to NTK, can the Hessian be replaced by the empirical NTK? All the following arguments would still hold, but now the eigenvalues would be for the empirical NTK instead, and would therefore be well-defined.  Similar ideas are used in [2].\n- The section headings don't seem like the ICLR defaults, and they are a little unpleasant. Can you change them back to the defaults?\n- How long does it take to estimate the learning capacity for a single model? Can you report this in terms of how much longer it takes than training a single model?\n- Do the numerical procedures (particularly the MCMC one) yield consistent estimators of the learning capacity? I'm guessing not, if the sigmoid parameterisation is necessary in both cases.\n\n[2] Hodgkinson, L., van der Heide, C., Salomone, R., Roosta, F., & Mahoney, M. W. (2023).
