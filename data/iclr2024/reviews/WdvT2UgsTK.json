The method uses a continual learning scheme that sequential trains the model with instances of ascending sizes. Furthermore, the method uses the following new components to improve the generalization performance: 1) An inter-task regularization scheme and intra-task regularization scheme that aim to retain knowledge from earlier training phases. 2) An experience replay mechanism that revisits smaller instances from earlier training phases. The authors train models for the TSP and CVRP on instances with 60 to 150 nodes and evaluate them on instances with 60, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 500 nodes. The experiments show that their approach generalizes well to instances with 60-150 nodes. On larger instances, the approach offers only very minor improvements over a standard model that has been trained on instances with 150 nodes only."

                "value": "- In my opinion the main weakness of this paper is that it does not provide enough ablation studies that evaluate the different components of the approach. The authors only provide some experiments for the TSP and only evaluate the experience replay and the intra-task regularization scheme in the main paper. In the Appendix some additional results for the TSP are reported but the CVRP is not considered at all. To fully convince me of the effectiveness of their proposed approach, the authors should report more detailed results for both problems in the main paper.\n- I find Figure 1 and Figure 2 difficult to understand. At the time they are mentioned in the text multiple components shown in the figure have not yet been explained. Overall, I find the semantic of figure elements confusing. For example, what is the output of the \u201cexperience replay with previous tasks\u201d element and why is there a connection between the current model and the \u201csize selection\u201d element? I think that Figure 1 especially should be simplified significantly.\n- On larger test instances with sizes not seen during training the model leads to only small performance improvements over existing methods.\n- The paper is missing a comparison to a naive POMO variant that is trained on instances of different sizes (e.g., in the range [60, 150]). The authors compare to AMDKD-POMO and Omni-POMO but both approaches seem to focus on the generalization to larger instances and do not perform well on the tasks reported in Table 1.\n\n**Post-rebuttal:**\nThank you for your response and for providing additional results. My main concern (the lack of ablation studies) has been addressed and I raise my score accordingly. I still believe that the ablation study deserves more space in the main and that Figure 1 does not succeed in providing an easy to understand, high-level overview of the method."
