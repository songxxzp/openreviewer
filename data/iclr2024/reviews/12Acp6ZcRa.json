Are there any scenarios where a malicious attacker can really cause any harm with these attacks?

Modifications take the form of typos, replacements with unicode characters, and replacements with similar-sounding letters. The errors the algorithm induces are images that are unfaithful to the prompt in some way. For example, one image is missing any depiction of ice cream when prompted for \u201cA giant icae cream sculpture towering over a miniature town.\u201d The method developed has three components. First, the most important words in the prompt are selected via word ablation. Then, random modifications are applied to that word (typos, etc.). Finally, the most successful modifications are adopted and the iteration repeats until a stopping condition is met. In order to instantiate this algorithm, the authors adapt and develop measurements for distance between distributions of texts and distributions of images. \n\nIn the parlance of the adversarial examples literature, this can be considered an untargeted black box attack."

While the final algorithm is quite simple at its core, the choice of metrics to use for attacking models that have non-deterministic outputs is not immediately clear. This paper examines the design space and its conclusions are useful reading for the community.  \n\nIt is also important to note that, to my knowledge, this is the first paper that strives to preserve the semantics of the input prompt in attacks on text-to-image generating models. Even though, as I point out in the Weaknesses section, how much those semantics are actually preserved is arguable, it is important that the method does not produce gibberish prompts."

This has particular relevance since the paper presents an untargeted attack and untargeted attacks in image generation can have a very loose definition. This has three prongs:\n1. The example prompt and image pairs that are selected in Figures 1, 6, 7, and 8 can reasonably be challenged on the grounds that many modifications, although minor in Levenstein distance, actually alter the semantics. For example, it is not obvious that the word \u201cpamda\u201d with an \u201cm\u201d should produce an image the animal panda. \n2. It is unclear what the following quantities are precisely: human labeler-provided consistency scores (in particular, what are N1 and N2 in Appendix D?), SI2T, and ST2I.\n3. The prompts that humans typed in seem rather to be rather easy attempts that do not alter the text semantics as much as the auto-modified prompts do. But humans can conceivably try harder. Is there a way to normalize for the strength of the attack? \n\nAnother point on which the paper can be improved is to develop methods for generating images based on the adversary\u2019s chosen semantics. In many practical scenarios, it is important to understand if images can draw very specific violating concepts. For example, adversaries might want to generate specific public figures in compromising scenarios.\n\nThe authors might also improve the paper by including a discussion of the ability to undo the adversarial modifications with different tokenization, with hand-written rules, or with Large Language Models that undo typos and glyph and phonetic replacements."

First of all, generally, the attack should be deployed with some malicious goal, while this paper considers the typos/glyph/phonetics as \"real-world attacks\" which could be controversial. In the real-world scenario, the existing typos/glyphs/phonetics are usually mistakenly caused by the users of T2I applications without malicious intentions, and even with a bad generation, the users can go back to check the mistakes in the prompts and fix them. It is hard to understand the purpose of these \"adversarial attacks\" in this scenario. Second, whether the robustness of the diffusion model to the text input is good or bad is another important question. In Figure 1, it is hard to say whether the generations based on these modified texts are \"wrong\". From another perspective, we can even conclude that these text-to-image models are \"accurate\" in generating images that reflect the text. Since the texts and their semantic meanings have changed, the generation \"accurately\" reflects the changes. It is also controversial that what criteria does the human evaluation adopts. Is it based on the difference between the image content and the original meaning of the text or the actual meaning of the text?\n\n2. All the examples are based on the deviation of the objects in the texts. As one character change in the noun can lead to another meaning, it is normal to see that the T2I does not generate the correct objects. The question is does this \"mismatch\" only happen in the noun words? \n\n3. The details of the human evaluation are not clear. Also, even with the clean inputs, the mismatch in the existing T2I models happens. The authors should provide the human evaluation results on the original text and corresponding images as a baseline, otherwise the human evaluation results in Table 2&3 are meaningless."
