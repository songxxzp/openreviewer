More specifically, the relation between self-labeling and dual-level representation is not clear. It seems that this study addresses two individual problems of the point-wise clustering method. The background of the point-wise clustering should be more informative to improve the readability. \n(2) I am not quite sure what the \"degenerate solution\" means for the point-cloud segmentation. It is also quite unclear why we need a semi-relaxed optimal transport problem definition from the introduction. What is the role of data-dependent annealing in the self-labeling process and dual-level representation? This is also not clear in the introduction. \n(3) For the Figure 1, the presentation is quite confusing, and there are even errors. For example, what do different colors represent? Which component represents the novel pseudo-label generation process? Where is the dual-level representation? The arrows among p and y on the right-most part of the figure are quite difficult to understand as well. The \"Encoder f_theta\" has been occluded...\n(4) In the experiment, especially Table 4, I found that the \"Region\" design only makes a minor contribution to the final performance, while the \"dual-representation\" is one of the major claimed contributions, making me feel that this paper is quite scattered. There is not a clear focus on tackling a specific problem, making me quite doubtful about the contribution of this paper. I agree that the studied topic is of great importance, but I believe the paper requires thorough refinement before publication."

The class distribution of pseudo-labels is regularized under the framework of relaxed Optimal Transport (OT).\n- To improve the ability to utilize the spatial relations among points, the authors propose to utilize both point-level and region-level features for pseudo-label generation."

                "value": "In Fig 1, the method requires 2 views of the same point cloud. Though not quite mentioned, I guess it indicates two independently augmented views of the same point cloud. This is however quite abnormal considering that the pseudo-label is based on prototypes. The paper does not really explain how the augmentation is used alongside all these proposed strategies, which is quite concerning: How  such augmentations affect the method? Does the method really need such augmentations to function? And how does it compare to the method in comparison, eg fairness?\n\nThe paper uses heavy notations but most of them are not quite explained and I would recognize some of the notation as unnecessary, especially the overly used sub/superscripts, which hinders the readability of this paper. For example, the notations in 3.1 and 3.2.\n\nRegarding the relaxed OT, the author adds an entropy term to Eq 4 to enable the use of fast scaling algorithms. However, this detail is not explained, regarding how it affects the OT solution and thus pseudo-label generation. In Appendix A, the discussion seems to be more focused on time complexity but not the class implance aspects.\nConsidering that the authors claim novelty in such formulation of relaxed OT, more discussion and analysis is required, especially regarding how OT captures the class balance/imbalance and its impact.\n\nBesides, since the authors emphasize the dynamic nature of weight r, which seems to be a key difference to previous methods, it's nice to see how this relaxed OT reduces to the original OT for a balanced class by controlling the r, if possible.\n\nAlso, how r affects the pseudo-label deserves more discussion and analysis. For example, a visualization on pseudo-labels of larger/smaller r, or theoretical analysis, would be desired."

This method relaxes the optimal transport problem by transforming it into a semi-relaxed optimal transport (OT) problem with an annealing-like regularization strategy. Moreover, the proposed approach includes a region-level branch by clustering points into regions and generating region-level features via pooling, complementing the point-level features for prediction. The proposed method is evaluated on two outdoor datasets, and it demonstrates impressive performance compared to the baseline method NOPS."

This could include parameters for the DBSCAN algorithm, visual examples of the resultant regions, and how variations in DBSCAN parameters may impact the results. Additionally, clarification on whether \"K\" is a fixed value for different scenes and how these \"K\" regions are generated during clustering is needed.\n3. Elaborating on the initialization and updating process for class prototypes would be beneficial to better understand the methodology.\n4. Discussing the applicability of the proposed framework in indoor scenarios, where there are typically more novel classes to discover, would enhance this paper's practical relevance.\n5. Conducting an ablation study on a split of the SemanticKITTI dataset, which is known to be more challenging than SemanticPOSS, would strengthen this paper's findings.\n\n\nA minor point: In Table 3, adding a column that indicates the split index, similar to Table 1, would improve clarity."
