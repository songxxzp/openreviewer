Experiment study is conducted on QKP, QIS, and QVC problem instances."

Also in deep learning experiments, larger datasets are often expected.\n* I couldn't find information about how the model was trained and the nature and size of the training dataset in my reading. If the training data consists of random instances, as shown in Figure 3, it's important to clarify how these instances were generated and the dataset's size. These details are crucial and should not be omitted in the main paper.\n* It would be beneficial to introduce a more comprehensive experimental metric that illustrates the trade-off between running time and solution quality. For instance, calculating the area under the curve of an objective score versus running time plot could provide valuable insights. Visualizing such plots in the main paper would enhance clarity. Additionally, the objective scores in Table 2 appear to have sharp fluctuations, which might warrant clarification \u2013 are these values selectively chosen?\n\n### Minor Points\n* In the first paragraph of Section 5, there are multiple brackets.\n* The methodology section primarily draws inspiration from recent advancements in neural network solvers for MILP, which, in my view, is not a significant issue."

Traditional solvers face limitations in solving large-scale QCQPs and NN based for QCQPs methods assume certain model parameter constraints. To address these limitations, the paper introduces NeuralQP, a hypergraph-based optimization framework for large-scale QCQPs. It consists of two stages: Hypergraph-based Neural Prediction, which creates a lossless representation of QCQPs, and Iterative Neighborhood Search, which employs a repair strategy based on the McCormick relaxation. Experiments demonstrate that NeuralQP outperforms traditional solvers like Gurobi and SCIP in terms of solution quality and efficiency, making it a valuable tool for solving large-scale QCQPs."

What about using the approach from Betrsimas (2020, 2021) which seems like a similar model.\nGNNs in general have issues with modelling large MILPs where the solution space is large with multiple optimal solutions. My feeling is that this model will have the same issues, since its an extension of GNN with more nodes and edges. The authors should discuss the models performance in these contexts. \nAlso the benchmarks used are more theoretical benchmark and not a traditional large size ML dataset. I suggest the authors find a ML application where QCQPs is natural and demonstrate the performance in that context."

The QCQP instance is represented by a weighted hypergraph, which in turn is encoded by a weighted factor graph, which is an input to a graph neural network. This network predict solutions and guides a \"neighborhood optimization\", which focuses on a subset of variables and uses a convex relaxation of bilinear monomials (by McCormick) to get bounds. Several neighborhoods are searched in parallel. Sometimes some of their variables are exchanged, which is called a \"cross-over\". (Let me note that my understanding of the algorithm is not precise due to low clarity of the paper, see below).\n\nIn experimental evaluation, the method is compared to SOTA QCQP solvers (Gurobi and SCIP) on three problems: quadratic knapsack (QKP), quadratic independent set (QIS) and quadratic vertex cover (QVC) problems. While QKP is well-known, QIS and QVC were newly designed in the paper. The instances of the problems were generated randomly (to my understanding), no real instances (available online) are used. The experiments report that the new method is consistently faster than Gurobi and SCIP, which is more pronounced on larger instances."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I see two major weaknesses:\n\nThe text is unclear and hard to understand. The English is poor. The notation and mathematical formalism are clumsy and not well thought-over. The text is not well structured: sometimes a simple thing is given too much space but some substantial things are only in the supplement. There are a number of mistakes. Please see examples below. \n\nIn experimental evaluation, only random QCQP instances (generated by the authors) are used. No real instances available online (e.g.,  QAPLIB) are used. It is well-known that random instances of optimization problems tend to be easier than real one. Moreover, the QCQP problems that are used are described (in the supplement) in an insufficient and unclear way and appear to be artificial and sometimes meaningless. Let me give details:\n\nQIS and QVP (described in sections A.4.1 and A.4.3) have not been proposed before, they were first proposed in the paper. However, their descriptions are confusing and insufficient and their formulations (7) and (10) not justified. No citations are given, neither to relevant similar problems nor their possible applications.\n\nE.g., in A.4.1. the authors say that \"the primary objective of [QIS] is to identify max. indep. set in the graph, which is a subset of vertices [...which..] do not belong to the same hyperedge\". But this does not correspond to (7) (moreover, it is unclear whether in $\\sum_{i,j\\in e}$ in (8) one allows $i=j$). Moreover, this can be easily expressed by the linear constraints $\\sum_{i\\in e}x_i\\le 1$. Morever, the authors introduced (randomly generated?) weights $a_i$ and $q_{ij}$ in the constraints without any explanation of their meaning. Last, it is not mentioned how the hypergraph $\\cal H$ is generated when generating the instances.\n\nIn A.4.3., again the meaning of QVC formulation in (10) is not explained and it appears to make no sense.  What is the asterisk symbol in (10)? Why are the variables denoted $u,v$ rather than $i,j$ as before? How are the coefs $c_u,q_{u,v}$ chosen?\n\nQuadratic Knapsack Problem is well-known but its definition in Section A.4.2 is different from the usual one (see, e.g., https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X06003878): in (8) there are multiple linear constraints on each individual binary variable $x_i$. This not justified and seems making no sense.\n\nDue to these issues, I do not recommend to accept the paper. However, the approach can be potentially interesting. I recommend the authors to improve the text and experiments and perhaps consult the paper with someone skilled in writing good conference papers, and resubmit.\n\nSome examples of mistakes / unclarities in the text:\n\n- Section 2.1: The set $\\cal X$ is mentioned only in problem formulation (1). In contrast, the set $\\cal N$ does not appear in (1) (as as written below (1)). It is not clear if the QCQP has continuous or integer variables.\n\n- Section 2.2: It is not described how the right-hand sides $b_i$ of MILP constraints are represented in the graph (despite the authors write that the MILP instance encoding by the graph is lossless). Similarly for the QCQP encoding in Section 4.1.1.\n\n- Sec. 3.1: The definition of \"bipartite hypergraph\" is unclear. Note that in the literature, it can mean several different things.\n\n- Sec. 3.1: Note that the result of \"star expansion\" is widely known in graphical models as \"factor graph\".\n\n- Definition 1: The incidence matrix $\\bf H$ and the \"neighborhood relation\" $N$ are almost the same thing and do not deserve a definition. I suggest using only one of these terms in the paper.\n\n- Def. 2: One cannot define ${\\cal N}_e(v)=\\\\{ e \\mid vNe, \\\\; v\\in V, \\\\; e\\in E \\\\}$ because $v$ is given outside. That is, $v\\in V$ must be omitted. Similarly in Def. 3.\n\n- Def. 5: Shouldn't $v_i$ be $c_i$? Otherwise, the definitiions of ${\\cal V}_x$ and ${\\cal V}_c$ make no sense if the sets $\\cal $N$ and $\\cal M$ are not disjoint.\n\n- Sec. A.4.1 (in the supplement): \"we introduce the concept of hyperdges\" - Why do you say this, after you used the concept of hypergraph many times before?\n\n- Algorithm 1 in supplement: This should not be called an algorithm, it is just calculations of formulas. Moreover, these formulas were stated  already in the main text but with different notation. Note that Alg. 1 is not called in any of Algorithms 2,3,4,5.\n\n- The QCQP formulation (1) is a minimization problem whether in the experiments (Tables 1,2) the problems are maximizations ones.\n\nPOST REBUTTAL: After rebuttal, the text was substantially revised by incorporating the reviewers' comments. However, I still find the paper not strong enough because of using only random QCQP instances. Moreover, the formulation of some QCQP problems still makes little sense: for example, in QMKP (quadratic multiple knapsack problem) one knapsack can take only one object, whereas in the original formulation (Hiley & Julstrom, 2006) each knapsack can take more objects (up to its capacity). Last but not least, let me remark that the initial manuscript was in a very poor shape and I believe it is not a good practice to submit such papers and rely on reviewers to eliminate mistakes. In summary, I am raising my evaluation by one level."
