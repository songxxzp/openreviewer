                "value": "- What is the rationale for expecting that movie review data of MPST is not a part of pretraining data for LLaMA? Is this likely to lead PerSE models to be biased similarly to GPT4 (albeit to a lesser extent due to personalization)?\n- Consider adding a citation/link for the MPST dataset.\n- I found the extended analysis of Sec 3.1 in A.1.2 to be significantly easier to understand than the writing of Sec 3.1. Please consider rewriting this section for clarity and to stand alone in the main body of the paper.\n- Relatedly, model based evaluations have been found to contain self-biases (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10020) - consider discussing or experimentally demonstrating the extent to which PerSE is likely to prefer generations from a LLaMA based text generation model.\n- Sec 5.1: How are the k examples from a reviewer's historical reviews used for training and evaluation selected? Is this a random set of k examples for the reviewer or is something else done?\n- Do I understand correctly that the DOC dataset contains generations from an existing system? If so, please discuss the implications of training PerSE on generated stories and its ability to judge generations from other systems. In a future use of PerSE do you envision that researchers will train a personalized evaluation model on the ratings from a small set of annotators?\n- Continuing from my previous question - it seems like the paper primarily proposes a method for rating prediction and posits that this may be used for personalized story evaluation. Please discuss how you envision this actually being used for text generation evaluation in much more depth. For example, what happens when there is no training data for training a model like PerSE in a specific domain? Why does it make sense to use a model pretrained on one set of users to evaluate text generated for a (hypothetical) other set of users? - it seems the most sensible for the text generation model to be trying to personalize text to the specific users on who the evaluation model is trained.\n- It is not clear to me that the the bias present in GPT4 for known plots immediately motivates a personalized evaluation - please consider rethinking/rewriting this motivation. For example, is there a simple bias correction one could apply to ratings produced from GPT4 so that known plots receive smaller scores?"
