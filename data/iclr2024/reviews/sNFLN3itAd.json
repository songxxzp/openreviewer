                "value": "Firstly, in the introduction section, the authors have described three ways to combine the MPNN and the SF. However, there are no clear comparisons among these approaches. For example, what use cases fit each approach, and what is the complexity cost of each way? Second, the description of their approach is in Section 3.2, which is very simple and straightforward. I expect more analysis on why the proposed method is better than other combinations, instead of proving why the proposed method is better than solely using the MPNN and solely using the SF. For the experiment, I consider the proposed framework to be a general framework that can be applied to various GNNs. Therefore, I expect to see the results of employing the proposed method in different GNNs to verify the generalizability of the proposed method. Moreover, I also want to ask the authors why to report the results in terms of different evaluation metrics in Table 3. Could you please provide a completed version in the appendix? Also, in Table 3, we can see in some datasets such as Core, CIteseer, and Pubmed, there is very slight difference between GAE and NCN. I highly recommend the authors to further investigate the best use cases of the proposed method. Furthermore, it would be very interesting to summarize a table that includes the pros, the cons, and the best use cases, the worse use cases of different combinations in Figure 2. In Section 6.2, the authors report the memory costs, I highly recommend the authors to report the time complexity cost of applying the proposed methods against solely applying the MPNN and solely applying the SF, as the time complexity is quite crucial to determine whether a model can be applied online or not. \nOverall, I do not think this paper is ready for publication for this version. Please correct me if I have some misunderstanding."

Further addressing the Common Neighbor (CN) distribution shift problem caused by the graph incompleteness in existing link prediction settings, the authors introduce the Common Neighbor Structure Completion module to enhance NCN's performance. Finally, through extensive experiments on seven commonly used link prediction datasets, the author demonstrates the model's effectiveness and establishes it as the new state-of-the-art model for link prediction tasks."

However, the potential of incorporating a broader neighborhood scope remains unclear. Could extending the common neighbor completion (CNC) to consider 2-hop neighbors improve performance significantly? It would be beneficial for the paper to discuss the implications of such an extension and, if possible, to present experimental results from implementing a 2-hop neighbor completion, referred to as NCNC, for a thorough comparison."
