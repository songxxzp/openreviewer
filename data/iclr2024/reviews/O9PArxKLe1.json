            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I think there is a terminology issue in the paper that could be confusing for readers. It appears the watermark \"key\" referenced in the paper more closely matches the concept of a watermark \"detector\" algorithm in methods such as RivaGAN and Tree-Rings; many methods often use \"key\" and \"message\" interchangeably to refer to the hidden signal. If this is true, the authors' proposed training of differentiable surrogate \"keys\" can be understood as training differentiable surrogate detector networks that predict the key/message concealed in a watermarked image --  allowing for gradient-based optimization attacks on non-differentiable detectors. The pseudocode in Algorithm 1 strongly suggests this. If this is the case, I urge the authors to revise their terminology to make this more clear.  \n  \n- - - -\n\nIt should be clarified that in the general no-box watermarking scenario, the second step $\\mathrm{EMBED}$ need not modify the parameters of the generator model, just endow it with watermarking capabilities (e.g. by applying a post-hoc watermarking algorithm to its outputs). As far as I can tell, none of the methods evaluated in the paper modify the generator parameters directly. Overall, the no-box watermarking steps and their instantiations for each of the evaluated watermarking methods are not clearly explained.\n  \n- - - -\n\nThe proposed method is similar to that of Jiang et al. [5] in that it adversarially parameterizes image transformations to remove watermarks. The authors claim that the method of Jiang et al. requires access to a watermarking \"key;\" however, Jiang et al. propose attacks under the explicit assumption that the attacker does not have access to the ground-truth key/message (which is either approximated via the detector model's predictions or sampled at random) -- from pp.6, \"the attacker does not have access to the ground-truth watermark $w$\".  On the other hand, if I am correct that the authors take \"key\" to mean \"detector,\" this claim makes more sense in that Jiang et al. use full access (white-box) or query access (black-box) to the detector to craft attacks. \n\nThe authors should clarify their statements about the prior work of Jiang et al. and the distinctions between their methods. And while additional experiments may not be feasible at this point for various reasons, I think the paper would be much stronger if it included comparisons between the proposed approach and either or both attack variants proposed by Jiang et al. This would also require modifying the proposed attack to evade two-tailed detection, as discussed by Jiang et al.\n\n- - - -\n\nIf the attacker \"does not need to invoke GKEYGEN\" for TRW/WDM/RivaGAN, as stated in section 4.2, does this mean the attacker does not train a differentiable surrogate detector? In this case, doesn't the proposed approach just become a standard white-box attack, as in Jiang et al.?\n\n- - - -\n\nThe authors do not provide any details of the architecture of the surrogate detector networks $\\theta_D$ trained by the adversary. This seems like a crucial aspect of the proposed approach, so it is strange that it is not discussed.\n\n- - - -\n\nThe related work section mixes references to image classifier watermarks [1][2] and watermarks for generative models [3], which are very different: the former aims to protect the intellectual property of a model developer, typically through query- or trigger-based verification, while the latter is embedded in all outputs of a generative model to distinguish real from fake content. This paper is concerned with the latter kind of watermark, so I'm confused by the emphasis on works in the former area. At the very least, these two different types of works should be clearly distinguished from one another in the related work section.\n\n- - - -\n\nAs far as I can tell, the term \"Adaptive Attack\" comes from the adversarial example literature -- the authors should explain what distinguishes an adaptive attack from a non-adaptive attack and probably cite the original work [4].\n\n- - - -\n\nFigure 1 is missing step #8 (it skips from 7 to 9).\n\n- - - -\n\nThis is a much smaller concern, but the substitution of the Stable Diffusion v1 generator for v2 does not seem like a very difficult obstacle for the attacker to overcome, given the general similarities in architecture and training. Attacks on post-hoc methods probably shouldn't be affected too much by the choice of surrogate generator, but Tree-Rings is deeply intertwined with the generator structure. Therefore, it would be interesting to see how attacks on TRW fare when there is a more substantial mismatch between the actual and surrogate generator.\n\n- - - -\n\nOverall, I think the central idea -- no-box watermark attacks with differentiable surrogates -- is very interesting, and the experimental results look very strong. However, I think the paper has many issues that still need to be addressed.\n\n\n[1] Nils Lukas, Edward Jiang, Xinda Li, and Florian Kerschbaum.
