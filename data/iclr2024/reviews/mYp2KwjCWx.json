The main contributions are twofold: (1) a novel objective to jointly train a goal proposal distribution and a goal-reaching policy based on empowerment with a reparameterization trick and (2) a hierarchical architecture that combines multiple goal-reaching policies in a hierarchical manner. The authors evaluate their method in several Ant/HalfCheetah goal-reaching tasks, showing that their hierarchical architecture enables long-horizon goal reaching."

                "value": "## Weaknesses\n- One major weakness of the proposed approach is that it assumes that the goal distribution $p_\\phi(z|s_0)$ is a uniform distribution over a *box*. This significantly limits the scalability of the method, because the set of feasible goals can form an arbitrary shape even in simple environments (e.g., mazes).\n- Another major weakness of this work is its limited empirical evaluation. For me, the proposed method is much closer to previous unsupervised GCRL methods (e.g., Skew-Fit, EDL, LEXA, etc.) than empowerment-based methods (e.g., DIAYN, DADS, HIDIO, etc.) given that (1) the latter uses a separate latent skill space $Z$ that is not \"grounded\" to the state space and (2) the former has the two-stage structure of goal proposal and goal reaching, similarly to the proposed approach. However, the authors only compare their method with empowerment-based approaches, which have already been known to struggle to reach distant goals (as shown in multiple prior works, such as EDL and LSD). I believe comparisons with unsupervised GCRL methods are necessary to assess the effectiveness of this method.\n- Moreover, the experiments are only conducted in Ant and HalfCheetah environments with $x$-$y$ goal spaces without obstacles. It is unclear how the proposed method performs in more complex environments (e.g., AntMaze) or other types of environments (e.g., Fetch manipulation environments), both of which are standard benchmarks for goal-conditioned RL.\n- The proposed method seems to assume access to the ground-truth transition dynamics function, which prevents its applicability to general environments.\n- In terms of writing, I feel Section 3.1 is not sufficiently clear. Please see my questions below.\n\n## Minor issues\n- \"The major problem with using empowerment for skill learning is that mutual information is difficult to optimize.\": Do the authors have any supporting evidence for this claim?\n- In Equations (4)-(5), I would suggest using $I^{GCE}(Z; S_n|s_0)$ to denote the mutual information (not its variational bound) and replacing \"$=$\" in Equation (5) with \"$\\geq$\", following the convention.\n- \"However, the existing empowerment-based skill-learning approaches that learn the variational distribution $q_\\psi(z | s_0, s_n)$ also require a model in large domains to obtain unbiased gradients of the maximum likelihood objective.\": I'm not sure if this can justify the second limitation because (1) albeit biased, previous empowerment-based approaches can still work without a model and (2) we can relabel $z$ as in P-HER (Choi et al., 2021) to make it (much) less biased with respect to the current skill discriminator. In this regard, I think \"First, similar to other empowerment-based skill-learning methods, our framework assumes the agent has access to a model of the environment\u2019s transition dynamics.\" is a bit misleading.\n- I would suggest using a higher-resolution image (or a vectorized pdf file) for Figure 3.\n\n\nIn summary, while I do think the reparameterized empowerment objective is intriguing, the limitations of the proposed approach seem to outweigh its strengths, and the empirical results are too weak to support the claimed benefits of the method."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- I found Sec 3.1 to be a bit confusing. Specific questions:\n    - What is $g$? Is it just an affine function?\n    - Is $h$ a learnable function, or just a projection to the goal space?\n    - \"instead of sampling the skill z from the fixed variational distribution\": Why do we need to sample $z$ from the variational distribution? Isn't $z$ deterministically determined by $\\epsilon$ and $\\mu_\\phi(s_0)$?\n- Where exactly does the proposed method use the ground-truth dynamics model? Is it required only for training higher-level policies, or is it used by the low-level policy as well?\n- The authors argue that the proposed method can reach much more distant goals (800x800) than DADS (30x30). However, I'm not sure if this is an apples-to-apples comparison given that (1) their environments are different (MuJoCo vs Brax), and (2) their episode lengths may be (very) different. What is the maximum episode length used in this paper?"

There have been recent advances in maximizing empowerment. Moreover, the general evaluation is too narrow: it only focuses on empowerment-based HRL methods. [2] has recently establishes a new state-of-the-art across many domains, where it greatly improves upon empowerment-based methods. Without such baselines it is impossible to evaluate the merit of the method.\n\nThe presentation of the paper could be improved: for example, what is the role of section 2.2? Is it absolutely necessary for understanding the contributions? If not it should go in the appendix. More central to the method itself, the paper claims that a new objective is derived for empowerment. However equation (3) is essentially the same objective that we have seen across the literature on empowerment-based methods. It seems like the only difference is the way the variational distribution q is parametrized. In itself this is not a bad thing, but coupled with strong claims that \"it explicitly encourages skills to target specific states\" and that the objective itself is \"new\" does not help the paper's quality.\n\nMoreover, despite claims that the method learns larger spaces and diverse skills, the qualitative evaluation is very limited, for example Figure 5 of Section B. Much more work is needed in order to convince the reader that this is indeed the case."
