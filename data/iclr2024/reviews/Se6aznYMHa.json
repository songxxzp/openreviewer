Exemplars is not a new idea; why would it be a contribution to extend it to contrastive models?\n\n2. In principle, Fig.1 or Eq2 is just an attribution of similar features between two images (nearest neighbor images). It does not seem to be relevant to the output of any downstream task. The CLIP encoding of one specific ostrich image is a unique vector, and it\u2019s always (most probably) close to other ostrich images. But this type of analysis, finding the nearest neighbor without considering the target class in any downstream task, always gives the Ostritch image in any task. Consider one of the Ostrich images. Classes, such as trees and grass, are also in the image. Both grass and trees get high clip similarity scores (to text encoder). The method, in that case, better show top neighbors considering these other concepts and attribute to those. The current formulation is limited.\n\n3. It is assumed that ANY attribution approach will work as expected. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as attributions are known to be disagreeing. Each one reveals different information. Thus, it\u2019s best to avoid generalization to ANY attribution method and just state what is done in the paper (which is activation values). It is better to put more detail on how this is exactly computed. \n\n4. More evidence is needed to prove if the attribution is working as expected. It might be that we are just highlighting salient features of the image *irrespective* of the other image. Try using the same Train Exemplar image with test images of other classes. This should be shown systematically, leaving no questions. (though I believe the authors if they let me know they tried and the method is sensitive)\n\n### Minor\n- The visual attribution does not give much information. Most of the information regarding explainability comes from exemplars themself which is a previous work.  It would be more useful if it\u2019s more fine-grained with respect to concepts in the images (using CLIP text encoder).\n- There are only a few qualitative examples of attribution. The work requires quantitative evaluations (for example, using segmentation masks) or some systematic qualitative experiments to convince us that it is working.\n- The confidence score is not a very interpretable number (imagine a user using your approach, use a short description useful to the user)"

CLIP encoder is trained contrastively by text-image pairs, not image-image pairs. In short, doing the same similarity attribution should be possible on any image encoder.\n- The OOD, with respect to adversarial examples, can be ineffective. You can design perturbed inputs (e.g., ostrich and sharks) that are all close to the embedding space while. Some comments on this would be helpful."

In such cases, the saliency maps would vary significantly in their attributions, yet, these images are still chosen as positive examples for the input.\n- The framework claims to be well-adaptive in explaining contrastive learning models; however, the proposed framework is only evaluated on the RN101-based CLIP model.
