Systems like WIMDB could also play an important role (as data is) in the interpretability and expandability of ML models' performance + reproducible models."

The appendix has a generous number of analyses and results that might be helpful for anyone working with these datasets.\n- The report of benchmark overlap is a nice side finding that will hopefully affect how future models trained on this data are evaluated.

This is not strictly a weakness as it goes beyond the scope of the proposed tool, but this should at least be discussed to make the observations more actionable.\n- The tool is only evaluated on English, and this is not explicitly stated. It is unclear if there are any English-specific biases in the way that e.g. PII regexes are designed, or if the tool can be expected to seamlessly generalize to other languages.\n- Given that it is a tool that is supposed to be user-friendly, it would be good to evaluate the usability, as the main contribution of the paper is not a method but a tool. How hard was it to dig out these quality findings, would an average user spot these quickly? Some kind of user study would be good to confirm that the tool is indeed usable. Are the statistics and summaries presented with visualizations to browse? The competitor, Know Your Data, might be good to compare against in that aspect, even if it doesn\u2019t come with the same efficiency."

If a corpus is supposed to be PII-filtered already, it would be very surprising to find more PII with this tool - or the regexes used here should be used to make the next generation of PII filter.\n- What are the limitations of the platform?"

Are you counting whitespace tokens or tokens from a subword tokenizer (which one, the same for all datasets)?\n- Domain counts: As the text tells us \"C4 contains documents from a diverse set of domains, and even the percentage of the most common one, patents.google.com, is less than 0.05%. [...]. Similarly, arxiv.org is responsible for more than 12% of the documents in RedPajama.\" While this is interesting, it feels like this topic is just scratching the surface and its still unclear how the rest of the data looks like.\n- N-Grams: Over tokens or characters?\n- Document duplication: The text says MD5, but then refers to \"Compressed counts\", which seems to describe MinHash?\n- Benchmark contamination: Frankly, the Llama2 technical report set a high bar for investigating contamination of relevant benchmarks. The selection here is not helpful for SOTA research, and the selection criteria is questionable: Why are benchmarks with less than one input field discarded? Why Promptsource?
