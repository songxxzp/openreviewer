There is a need to better explain which part of the approach captured the long-range information on the spatial-temporal graph. \n\nW1.b) As discussed in the paper, this approach can distill invariant representation from LLM to benefit scenarios involving spatial-temporal distribution shifts. However, when prompting the LLM, the handcraft prompt was constructed by the dynamic spatial-temporal context of the region, so it\u2019s a bit confusing about what the \u2018invariant representation\u2019 referred to. Moreover, it seems that there is no experiment in this paper to evaluate the model performance over distribution shift.\n\n\nW1.c) Although the method performed well under data sparsity, this seemed not equivalent to good denoising capabilities. It would be better to conduct additional experiments with varying levels of noise added to the data to further justify it.\n\n\nW2. The experiments can be further improved.\n\n\nW2.a) Since task-specific baselines were used to compare with the proposed method in the crime prediction and traffic prediction tasks, it\u2019s recommended to add a specific baseline for house price prediction.\n\n\nW2.b) According to Table 1, some result values are relatively small. This suggests that the experimental results may be susceptible to random factors.
