For the proposed model, MetaPhysiCa, the authors first describe the deterministic underlying structural model, where at each time step, the hidden state $x$ can go through different bases functions. The derivative is a combination of the task-specific coefficients and selected bases functions. Given the training data, the authors extract the underlying causal structure from causal structure discovery problem (minimal causal structure with the last number of edges). The structure parameters, global parameters and task-specific parameters are minimized using the binarization tricks to approximate. The authors have provided the proof to show that MetaPhysiCa can correct identify the causal structure. During the test time, the task-specific parameters can be adjusted. In the experiments, the authors show that the MetaPhysiCa can perform better than existing PIML method in the tasks."

Additionally, it is assumed that the proposed system is trained on a set of related training instances (from some dynamical system e.g., pendulum) to learn the parameters of the basis functions (specifically a sub-set of the basis functions that govern the task) as well as to learn parameters that are involved in the linear combination of these basis functions. These basis functions (with appropriate learned parameters) and their linear combination comprises the causal structure discovery mechamism (CSM) proposed in the paper. Additionally, the authors adopt a meta-learning approach where the CSM model (trained on multiple trajectories with different initial conditions and PDE parameters) is additionally also trained with a invariant-risk minimization (IRM)  type of loss (specifically minimal variance of loss across all training tasks).  Once the model is trained with the CSM + IRM based losses, the test-time comprises a few-shot adaptation (only of a subset of parameters of the model) to the  related but new (initial, PDE parameters) condition of the dynamical system.  \n\nThe authors demonstrate that the proposed model in multiple contexts (i) epidemic modeling (ii) predator-prey systems (iii) pendulum system  and showcase better OOD adaptation compared to traditional physics-informed approaches as well as other approaches like Neural ODE."
