                "value": "This paper presents a probabilistic deep learning model designed to predict the 3D directions of elementary particles from point cloud data, specifically targeting the detection of dark matter. The primary challenge tackled is determining the initial directions of low-energy electrons. The architecture used is a sparse 3D convolutional neural network. The output is parameterized using a von Mises-Fisher distribution, as the directional outputs need to be constrained to the 2-sphere. When compared against a non-machine learning approach on a simulated dataset, the proposed model shows a significant improvement in mean cosine distance."

I also like the fact that the proposed approach uses both a probabilistic output for quantifying the uncertainty as well as doing on-manifold predictions.\n\nS2. Model Calibration: The paper shows that the model is well-calibrated on simulated data and can identify low-uncertainty samples, which is crucial for real-world applications. This ability to filter out ambiguous predictions is very useful for improving the accuracy and realiability which is important in science applications.\nThe comparison to a deterministic model trained with the cosine distance loss also demonstrates that the method performs well compared to the baseline.\n\nS3. Technical Depth: The method seems to be well thought out and goes into detail on computing the negative log-likelihood loss, and practical considerations for stable training."

Although simulations are valuable, as this is an application-focussed paper, it would be useful to also evaluate the model on real-world data, possibly obtained from actual detectors, to gauge its performance under realistic conditions.\n\nW4. Interest to the community: The paper is focussed on a very specific application and I'm not sure how relevent the method is to the ICLR community. Perhaps it would be better suited to a physics journal. Related to this, if the paper is aimed at the ICLR audience, then the introduction needs to be written in a way that clearly explains the problem and why it is important from an ML perspective.\n\n[1] Gilitschenski, Igor, et al. \"Deep orientation uncertainty learning based on a bingham loss.\" International conference on learning representations. 2019."

While the results shown on simulated test cases are encouraging and show that the approach works in principle, it is unclear how large the sim-to-real gap is. It is hard to determine how realistic the Degrad simulations are as compared to real measurements of electron recoils. Furthermore, Degrad presumably carries with it a whole host of parameters; a few are mentioned in the text (e.g., gas mixtures, temperatures, pressure, etc.). While I understand that the combination of parameters chosen was inspired by prior work (Jaegle et al.) it is unclear how well these parameters are constrained in reality and what happens to the deep-learning model if it encounters variations such as those expected in real data. E.g., does the model completely break if we now test it on trajectories generated at 21\u00b0 instead of 20\u00b0, etc.? These tests for systematic error sources won't determine the gap between simulation and reality, but they will be a first step towards that goal. I think that additional experiments explicitly testing these potential sources of systematic errors and/or a discussion that fully discloses these limitations should be present. The discussion should include what is key or missing from having this work on real (not simulated) data.\n\n2. It is unclear from the paper exactly what the key novelty is. Initially, I thought that this is the first DL framework for the task, as is also demonstrated by the result comparison in Fig. 4. After reading the conclusion, it was unclear if there were prior DL works, and this paper introduces the von Mises Fisher distribution for prediction. It crucial to clearly clarify this in the text. If this is not the first DL approach to the task, I would expect a comparison with prior DL approaches.\n\nMinor comments\n--------------------\nI have a few minor comments that also need addressing:\n\n1. Section 5 probably should be moved to the supplementary, but in any case, it should not be after Section 4.3. Estimating an arrow might be a sanity check but it is irrelevant once the reader has already seen more complex examples. \n2. What do the colors in Fig. 1 represent? Ionization? A color bar should be present and this should be mentioned in the caption\n3. Consider replacing Table 1 with a more useful and digestible visual representation, like a block diagram\n4. While the model includes an uncertainty estimate and is therefore heteroscedastic across different trajectories, it should be mentioned that the uncertainty is assumed to be homogeneous along a single trajectory (i.e. all data points within a trajectory have the same uncertainty)\n5. The term \"efficiency cut\" is introduced in 4.3 (first paragraph) but only explained later in Fig. 4"
