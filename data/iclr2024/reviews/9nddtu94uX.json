The specific approach here is to replace the human side with an LM trained on human queries. This trained LM then interacts with ChatGPT to bootstrap more data. While the approach can produce interesting artifacts such as the dialogue dataset, I don't think the research goal -- making bootstrapping data from ChatGPT easier -- is a scientific problem. \n- **Performance**: After reading the paper, it's unclear to me whether there are real gains from first training a human query simulator and then using its simulated data. For instance, in Table 2 with the same number of examples, PlatoLM-7b doesn't outperform Vicuna-7B with 10k examples for MT-bench. \n- **Understanding**: After reading the analysis section (Sec 5), it's still unclear to me that if there's a benefit from using Socratic simulated data, what would be an intuitive reason for that? I can imagine the technique useful when the number of total human queries is small, where fine-tuning on human queries helps the query model learn the style. The pretrained base has a lot of knowledge; thus the fine-tuned query model can produce much more diverse query content. But small human data setting is not explored.\n\nI read the author response and have updated my score."

In this regard, I have the following questions:\n\n   (1) Are there any qualitative performance trends for user simulator and assistant model using the same or different backbone? For example, different backbones have a better performance than the same backbones.\n\n   (2) The \"overly clever LLaMA-2 backbone\" mentioned in Appendix F needs to be further proved by using the LLaMA-1-13B model.\n\n   (3) Will there be better results when the user simulator is more complex than the assistant model? For example, use LLaMA-2 as the user simulator and LLaMA-1 as the assistant model.\n\n   (4) Will there be better results when the user simulator is used as the initialization checkpoint of the assistant model?\n\n3. How does the performance of using Vicuna as the backbone of user simulator and assistant model? This means that we don't need to train an additional user simulator.\n\n4. Is the difference between the middle and right subgraphs in Figure 1 only the user simulator? Is the way the dataset is generated the same?\n\n5. Would this framework still work on a dataset generated by a stronger model, eg. alpaca-gpt4?"
