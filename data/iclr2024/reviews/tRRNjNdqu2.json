To prevent negative loss values, they\nuse a soft limit by reducing the absolute values.\n\nUsing a dataset that contains parts that are healthy, faulty, and\nunknown condition, they set up different scenarios for supervised,\nsemi-supervised, and unsupervised learning.

Then a\ncomparison with regular supervised learning without an autoencoder\nwould be important.\n\nDetails are in questions below."

Squared-L2 norm / n is equivalent to MSE, so the two\nloss functions differ by a constant (n is the same in both loss\nfunctions).  That is, when Squared-L2 norm is minimized, MSE is\nminimized.  When MSE is minimized, RMSE is also minimized.  Similarly,\nwhen Squared-L2 norm is mininized, L2-norm is minimized.  Hence, the\nfour loss functions seem to be equivalent in terms of minimization.\nAny insights on why these four loss functions are chosen?\n\n\n2.  Table 2: $e_la$ and $e_a$ are different, but only $e_la$ is\ndiscussed in the text.  What are the values for $e_a$?\n\n\n3.  Equation 1: what is the motivation?\n\n\n4.  Table 4: What are H, HU, HUF?  Does each file have multiple\ninstances?\n\n5.  Tables 6 and 7: how do you get inf % improvement?"
