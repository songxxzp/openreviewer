The assumptions should be clearly written with numbers. The implications of assumptions should be briefly discussed. A theoretical contribution needs necessary for this work: how do we guarantee C' is actually converging to C? Do we have any error analysis (for example when k is equal to the dimension of C, can we say S_k progressively converge to M?\nThe algorithm needs more clarification than that of page 5. If more space is needed and Appendix can be helpful. \n\nFig 2 axis are not clear.\n\nRegarding 2: A very clear and distinct set of contributions should be added. Sections 1 and 2 outline the big picture of the paper, but they fail to deep dive into what specific problems are being addressed.\nThe problem of model discovery has been examined in the past by many researchers (as is also evident from literature review of authors). Each work propose a new direction; its either very suitable for a specific subject, or they are setting up a whole new direction. This paper fails to clearly deliver the message of which direction they are pursuing. \nIn particular, there are various works that use autoencodrs and they use the latent space to identify an interpretable coordinates to identify the model system in a lower order (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02710, https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1906995116, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36799-6, among few, where they use concepts from Koopman theory to linearly identify the system, SINDy to symbolically represent the governing equations, and Nueral ODE to parameterize the governing equations). Although authors can argue they look for relatively different concepts (the number of conserved quantities) but all above approaches can also be used for the same task. Plus they have been validated for a long time. They may also be more data efficient and faster. So more comparisons with SOTA is required (also authors should position their work in reference to Hamiltoninan/Lagrangian Neural networks)."

Some discussion on this choice could be helpful.\n\nHow would algorithm work for more complicated dynamical systems, e.g. higher dimensions with chaotic nature or stiffness? Finding conserved quantities in such scenarios can highlight the true power of this algorithm (when compared to other methods). \n\nIn abstract and section 1, robustness to noise is mentioned but a very careful analysis for this is missing in the paper."
