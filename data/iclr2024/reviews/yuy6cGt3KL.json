The narrative flow of the paper is clear and it's overall well-written.  I also really liked the authors' analysis of the empirical results.  The conclusions they drew in Section 5 are interesting and well-described, suggesting real, useful recommendations for the application of CATE estimators.\n\nBased on authors' response, I have updated my score from a 6 to an 8."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The introduction suffers from a bit of hyperbole.  For example, \"This [...] problem is at the heart of EVERY decision making problem\", \"With the emergence of rich data sets\" (implying that 'rich data sets' are new), and \"The challenging task is to identify which individuals...\" ('The' implies it is the only challenging task - it should 'A challenging task' or even 'An important yet challenging task').\n\nSome terminology clarification could be helpful here.  There are a few terms which, while present in the literature, are not necessarily universally used.  For example, 'nuisance models' and the task being 'model selection' rather than causal modeling/discovery/inference.  Also, the first sentence of Section 2 says that X \"represents the controls.\"  However, 'control' is a pretty overloaded term in causality (generally referring to treatment = 0 in a binary treatment setting), and, especially since you're only considering binary treatment, calling the X's controls just feels unnecessarily confusing.  'Covariates' or 'confounders' would be clearer.  The term 'metric' also feels a bit overloaded and could at least benefit from some clarification of what definition you're using here.  In evaluation literature, I generally expect a 'metric' to be a measure of performance.  So, for example, In Table 1, I would call 'PEHE' the evaluation metric the things under the 'Metric' column 'Estimators'.  Just a sentence or two early on to clarify these definitions would go a long way for increasing clarity.\n\nIn Section 2, you define tau(x) as CATE and tau-hat as a CATE estimate.  However, I don't see where you define tau\\~, which appears for the first time, I believe, under 'CATE Model Selection Metrics' as a term in the equation.  The next sentence mentions learning tau~, but I don't see anywhere where you describe what it actually represents.  Actually, it looks like you may just be missing the ~ in the sentence before the equation (where it reads: \"includes approximating the ground-truth effect (tau(X)) on the validation set\").\n\nWhile I appreciate at some level the inclusion of novel metrics, given that you already are considering quite a lot of metrics, I would have liked more of a discussion as to the motivation for including each of these new ones.  Is there something that's lacking in the existing set of metrics that led you to the new ones?  Or are there aspects of the new metrics that you think could capture something that isn't currently captured?  Performance-wise, none of the IPTW modifications (IPTW Switch T Score, IPTW CAB T Score) appear to do better than just IPTW score, and Qini and Calibration scores rarely do better either.  That doesn't mean that these metrics weren't worth considering, or that the results aren't interesting.  As it is, while IPTW and Targeted Learning at least have a sentence each about why they are being included here (due to their handling of extreme propensities which other metrics don't do), the Calibration Score discussion just says that it \"has been studied on RCTs\", and Qini just says it comes from the uplift modeling literature.  Without a strong justification for including them, and without them performing particularly well in the results, they just come across as being included for the sake of it, and they contribute little to the paper as a whole.\n\nGiven that the two-level model selection strategy is described by the authors as 'novel', I wish a bit more detail were given.  As it is, it says \"we first select its hyperparameters using a metric that is designed with similar inductive bias\" - what metric?  Does it vary by estimator?  Also, is this a contribution? (it's described as novel but I don't see it listed under 'Contributions' in the introduction)\n\nThere are some typos/grammatical issues.  Just looking at the introduction, the first sentence of the 3rd paragraph should say \"This has led\", not \"This has lead\", in the 4th paragraph, \"which have also been shown to be effect than other metrics\" is missing the word 'more', and in the Contribution, the first sentence should not contain a semi-colon (since the phrase that comes after is a dependent clause - just replace with a regular comma)."

                "value": "In Section 3.1, the IPTW Switch equation shows using the IPW approach if the propensity score is >= epsilon, and the regression learner when it's < epsilon.  Presumably, epsilon is a small number.  However, the sentence after that equation says that you use IPW \"if the propensity of the observed treatment for that sample is large.\"  It looks like the regression learner is being used when the propensity score is small (< epsilon), which means that IPW is being used whenever the propensity score is just 'not small' (>= epsilon), which is very different from it being 'large'.  Am I misunderstanding something here?\n\nIn Section 4, under \"CATE estimators with well-tuned nuisance models\", the 3rd paragraph start with \"Further for the CATE estimators with final models (f)\" - what does it mean for an estimator to have a 'final model' vs not?"
