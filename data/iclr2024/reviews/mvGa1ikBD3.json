                "value": "Most of my concerns are reflected in the questions section below.\n\n**Novelty and contributions**\nThe scope of the problem setup is narrow (anisotropic hyperelastic material without considering plasticity, contact, or collision). Therefore, I expect an in-depth study of this problem to justify its publication. This can include deep insight into anisotropic materials, comparisons with strong and fine-tuned baselines, comprehensive analysis of its generalizability, or demonstrating its exciting downstream applications with anisotropic materials.\n\n**Methods**\nThe notations in the technical methods are confusing, and I feel it would be challenging for people lacking deformable solid simulation background to understand and reproduce this paper. I left a number of specific questions in the \u201cQuestions\u201d section below.\n\n**Experiments**\n- I feel the problem size is too small to conduct meaningful analysis on GNNs. 60-120 elements (the training problem size) are considered very few for deformable solid simulation and can be solved quickly and accurately with numerical methods. The \u201cDeformablePlate\u201d in MeshGraphNet contains ~1200 nodes (so >= 300 tetrahedrons, with contact/collision handling). A modern, GPU-based numerical simulator can probably scale this up even more without losing speed or accuracy if no contact/collision needs to be solved, which seems to be the setup of this paper. I do agree with the intro that learning-based approaches can \u201cstrike a balance between accuracy and efficiency,\u201d but such a tradeoff doesn\u2019t need to exist for very small problems.\n\n- Baselines: The performance of the baseline seems much worse than what the original MeshGraphNet paper reported. A concrete example is Fig. 6: if MeshGraphNet caused 60% volume change, their \u201cDeformablePlate\u201d example would have exhibited very obvious artifacts. I wonder whether the variational loss + MeshGraphNet combination negatively influenced its performance, but I am not sure. Also, following my first point, I feel the paper lacks a crucial comparison to the reference simulator in terms of speed and accuracy.\n\n- I also feel the study on the method\u2019s generalizability is limited. Having more diverse, spatially varying fiber orientations other than horizontal and vertical ones would be more convincing. Testing it on more realistic hyperelastic materials (e.g., Neohookean or corotated) would be useful as well."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "**Technical questions about the network design**\n- I suspect \u201cf^{v->e}\u201d in \u201cvertex processing\u201d of Figure 2 should be replaced with \u201cf^{e->v}\u201d.\n- I don\u2019t quite follow why fiber orientation is an edge feature. It seems more reasonable to consider fiber orientation as a (finite) element feature if there is such a thing in the network module. The reason why I have this feeling is that F, the deformation gradient, is typically an element quantity in linear tetrahedron finite elements, and Eqn. (6) indicates that it\u2019s convenient to consider d as an element quantity as well.\n- Could you clarify the notation \u201cE_j\u201d in Eqn. (4)?\n- How are E_x, E_y, E_z in Eqn. (4) defined? I am guessing that one of them is d and the other two are orthogonal to d, but I am not quite sure.\n- I am not sure I get the intuition behind explicitly formulating three weighted sums of e_j in  Eqn. (3). Part of me wonders whether it is truly necessary, as the directional information d is already provided in the edge feature. I can accept that doing so does not hurt, but it would be nice if the authors could provide more insights into this design decision. This seems crucial for the paper\u2019s technical contribution, so I want to make sure I fully understand it.\n\n**About the loss function**\n- Eqn. (5): Is x^{t+1} computed from a^{t+1} or is it an independent variable? I am guessing that the network produces a^{t+1}, which is then used to compute x^{t+1}, and both a^{t+1} and x^{t+1} are fed into this loss function.\n- Eqn. (6): I understand that the text already mentioned that the loss function sums up per-element potentials, but I\u2019d still appreciate a more rigorous writing of the strain energy, i.e., adding a proper sum over all finite elements and defining how F is computed from x^{t+1} (e.g., by citing 16 or similar literature). Echoing my question above, I\u2019d also like to understand how dFFd is computed in a single element.\n- While I appreciate the choice of using the incremental potential as the loss function L, I feel there are some subtleties after incorporating the network. Let x be the new position and theta be the network parameters. A stationary point of min_x L(x) nicely solves implicit Euler integration because L is its variational form, but a stationary point of min_theta L(x(theta)) only satisfies dL/dtheta = dL/dx * dx/dtheta = 0. From a theoretical perspective, whether this guarantees dL/dx = 0 (the true solution to the implicit Euler integration) is not obvious to me.\n\n**About network training**\n- Could you elaborate on how the fiber orientations are uniformly sampled in each element? Also, is each element assigned an independently sampled direction? The results seem to contain only horizontal and vertical directions shared by all anisotropic elements.\n\n**About the \u201cConvergence\u201d experiment**\n- Is Fig. 3 displaying the training loss or its difference from the ground truth incremental potential solved by the reference simulation?\n- I suggest adding another figure that directly visualizes the difference between the network-predicted x^{t+1} and the reference x^{t+1} from the numerical simulator.\n- Fig. 4: Why is the \u201ctotal\u201d energy difference lower than the \u201cfiber\u201d term difference?\n- For both Figs. 3 and 4, I am not sure whether the worse performance of MeshGraphNet should be attributed to the network lacking the direction-aware message-passing mechanism or the decision to use the new loss function in MeshGraphNet.\n\n**About the \u201cVolume Preservation\u201d experiment**\n- A minor comment is that Poisson\u2019s ratio = 0.48 does not mean zero volume change. It would be informative to add a third curve in Fig. 6 showing the volume change from the reference simulator.\n\n**About the \u201cTip Displacement\u201d experiment**\n- I am trying to understand the significance of the \u201cTip Displacement Error.\u201d What is the average size of the finite elements in these scenes?\n- Also, how many elements does a test scene typically have?\n\n**About the \u201cImbalanced Forces\u201d experiment**\n- I like this experiment more than the others, but again, what is the size of the finite elements? Without knowing it, I was having a difficult time calibrating the \u201cForce Density\u201d column and the \u201cImbalanced Force\u201d column in Table 2.\n\n**About the \u201cGeneralization\u201d experiment**\n- I didn\u2019t find quantitative data about this experiment. In particular, how different is it from the deformed shape computed from the reference simulator?\n- I am curious to see the generalization to more diverse, spatially varying fiber orientations."

This allows the network to additionally learn anisotropic deformation.
