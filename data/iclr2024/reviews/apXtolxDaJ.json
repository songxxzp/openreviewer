I am curious about if there is some formal statement or proof on this topic, since it serves as a very important property of your paper. There is some parameter in the definition of the representation rank (e.g. $\\epsilon$) in Definition 1, but I didn't see it in the following discussion.\n\n2. When the authors transform the constraint in Eqn. (11) to the penalty regularizer with ReLU in Eqn.(12), is there any theoretical support for this transformation? And also is there any theoretical analysis on how to choose the value of $\\beta$? I check the ablation study on this hyperparameter on Appendix, but I feel its choice is still quite important but unclear in practice.\n\nFor the Eqn. (5), should the $\\phi$ be $\\Phi$?"

Combined with the regularization method, several baseline methods such as DQN and DDPG outperform existing baselines."

On page 5, what is the exact definition of $\\mathbb{SG}$? \n\nI do not quite get why the authors need to design the regularization term as in (12). It seems more natural to me to set the regularization term as in (19), which avoids a calculation of the gradient of an inverse term $1/|\\phi(s,a)|$ which might hurt the stability of the optimization process. \n\nThe logic behind the superior performance of BEER is not clear to me. The authors tried to claim that 'representation rank affects the model performance (approximation error), while BEER explicitly controls the rank, thus BEER outperforms other baseline methods'. However, according to figure 2, InFeR has a similar representation rank as BEER, while it performs worse than BEER. Is there any explanation why such a phenomenon happens? Meanwhile, in simpler tasks (Grid World), the rank of BEER is higher than other baselines, while in complex tasks (Lunan radar), the rank of BEER is lower than other baselines. Due to the inconsistency, it is doubtful whether the performance gain is due to the better control of representation rank. If so, it indeed deserves more explanation."
