The authors explored a way of using generative models for data augmentation for training image segmentation models, With the increasing fidelity of image generation models, e.g., stable diffusion, it is worth to have a study on how the powerful image generation model can empower or benefit image understanding tasks.\n\n2. This work proposed two strategies for augmenting image segmentation data to boost the performance of image segmentation models. Specifically, the authors employed stable diffusion model to generate masks from texts, and then used ControlNet-like model for mask-to-image generation. These two strategies together helps to attain a large amount of image-mask pairs with high quality.\n\n3. Based on the proposed techniques, the authors augmented COCO training set for image segmentation and then tried two training strategies: pretraining and joint training. It turned out that the extra generated images are beneficial to the image segmentation models under different settings."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. My main concern is about the relatively marginal improvement after adding a large amount of generated images. Though the author claimed over 2pt and 1pt gain for tiny and large models on ADE20k, I think the performance-price ratio is pretty low in that they generated over 1M images for ADE20K, which is significantly larger than the original training data size. Likewise, the authors also generated over 1M images for COCO, which is around 10 times bigger than the original training data. However, the gains for large models are less than 1pt across the board. These results make me highly doubt whether the generated images are really extrapolating the training data or just lazily interpolating the training data.\n\n2. The ablation study using 1000 training examples is misleading. If I understand correctly, the authors still used the full COCO training set for training the image generation models. As such, the generation models are indeed able to \"extrapolate\" the training data beyond the 1000 examples, and the final improvements over the baseline which merely uses 1000 real examples are not surprising at all. I would suggest the authors fine-tune a generation model on the 1000 real examples and see whether the generation model can do \"extrapolation\", which I think is a very important factor in making the method shine.\n\n3. There is no clear guidance on when we should use data augmentation training and when using the pretraining strategy with the generated data. The current study is somehow empirical and the audience cannot get a good amount of insights on when to use which techniques. In practice, however, having a principle is very important given that trial-and-error on the huge amount of generated data is usually with high cost. Moreover, Fig 7 implies another uncertainty on how to determine the augmentation probability on a custom dataset. The authors conducted the ablation study only on ADE20K, which is insufficient to draw any conclusion.\n\n4. With all the above being said, I think the authors failed to study a very critical problem -- how to improve the diversity and quality of the generated images so that we can use much less generated samples to improve the performance of image segmentation models? Given what is presented in this paper, it is really hard to capture any idea about what we should do to improve the data-efficiency of the method, and what knowledge the generated images can bring to the image segmentation models.I would highly encourage the authors think about this and make the work more solid."
