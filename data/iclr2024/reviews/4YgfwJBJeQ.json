To qualitatively evaluate the chart perception tasks, the authors also introduce a Structuring Chart-oriented Representation Metric (SCRM). This metric evaluates the extracted chart data using Intersection over Union (IoU). Additionally, the authors construct a synthetic chart dataset called SimChart9K, which is helpful for downstream tasks. The numerical experiment shows the efficiency of the proposed method.

However, the reasoning process is based on the black box GPT-3.5, which cannot find the relationship between STR and the reasoning process. More explanations are required. \n2. As shown in Eqn. (2), the SRT splits each element in LCT as one unique sample. However, SRT may destroy the intrinsic relationship between the original elements, making them independent. \n3. In Equation (3), the authors introduce the Entity Match method, which employs Intersection over Union (IOU) to compare predictions with ground-truth entities. Do the authors consider the order of the entity strings during the matching process? Ordinarily, aligning the strings in the correct order is essential for accurate matching. However, Equation (3) lacks a detailed explanation of how this matching process is carried out. More discussions are required.\n4. The authors adopt STR to make each entity independent. How do the authors determine the correspondence between predictions and specific ground-truth?\n5. In Table 2, it's noteworthy that the authors have not included a comparison with Matcha[1] and Deplot[2] on the Chart2Text[3] dataset. An explanation for this omission is needed.\n6. In Table 2, the comparisons between StructChart and the compared methods (Matcha and Deplot) somewhat is unfair. StructChart leverages powerful GPT-3.5 as the reasoning model, whereas Matcha is based on Pix2Struct[4] and Deplot relies on Codex or GPT-3. Thus, the disparities in performance between StructChart and the compared methods could potentially stem from the utilization of different reasoning models (i.e., GPT-3 and GPT-3.5).\n7. In Table 4, the authors conduct a comparison of StructChart with various baseline methods using the Exact Match metric. It's important to note, however, that the authors have omitted a direct comparison with Deplot, which outperforms StructChart with a higher score (i.e., 76.7 compared to 65.3). In this way, StructChart has no advantage compared with Deplot even if it uses more powerful GPT-3.5.\n8. In Table 2, the \u2018merging\u2019 is confusing. Does it merge the ChartQA with the SimChart 9K?\n\n\n[1] Matcha: Enhancing visual language pretraining with math reasoning and chart derendering, ACL 2023.\n\n[2] Deplot: One-shot visual language reasoning by plot-to-table translation, ACL Findings 2023.\n\n[3] Chart-to-text: Generating natural language descriptions for charts by adapting the transformer model, ACL 2020.\n\n[4] Pix2Struct: Screenshot Parsing as Pretraining for Visual Language Understanding.
