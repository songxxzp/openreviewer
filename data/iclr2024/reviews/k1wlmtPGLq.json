It proposes a method called Temporal Accumulated Batch Normalization (TAB) which uses temporal accumulated statistics for data normalization to solve a well-established problem called Temporal Covariate Shift, enhancing the efficiency of SNN training. The paper presents experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and DVS-CIFAR10 datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of TAB in improving accuracy.

                "value": "In Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Internal co-variate shift denotes alterations in the input distribution due to preceding layer updates. In Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), the Temporal Covariate Shift (TCS) problem arises from both previous layer updates and prior time steps, extending along the temporal dimension. Within SNNs,  neurons accumulate incoming spikes in their membrane potential over time and only generate a spike when this accumulation surpasses a threshold, staying inactive otherwise within the current time-step.\nHence, the accumulation of synaptic currents in the membrane potential is affected by temporal dependencies, which could magnify the internal covariate shift as time progresses. The central concept of this study revolves around addressing the challenge of applying batch normalization during SNN training while considering the temporal data dependencies and the issue of temporal covariate shift. TAB (Temporal Accumulated Batch Normalization) is proposed which closely follows neuron dynamics, especially the accumulated membrane potential, enhancing the accuracy of batch statistics. This alignment establishes a natural link between the behavior of neurons and the application of batch normalization in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). TAB uses Temporal Accumulated Statistics (dynamically using a moving averaging approach) for data normalization, introducing learnable weights to differentiate the impact of each time-step on the final result. The study also provides a theoretical connection between TAB method and the neural dynamics."
