Eg if the document corresponds to the correct concept+user it is a positive document and negative if not?\n- Please clarify in greater detail what data is used for training and evaluation. \"For each user type, we systematically exclude all documents associated with that user type from the database, treating them as reference documents\" -- its not clear what this means? Is this implying that no documents corresponding to the user type are available for training?\n- Sec 6.1: What reference documents are used for summarization evaluation? Eg in computing metrics like rouge.\n- The paper could benefit from inclusion of examples for concept, user type, positive document and negative document for concept and user type - perhaps in Fig 1.\n- If the experimental setup contains as input a query + positive document for user type - It would be illustrative to have a simple personalized ranking baseline which computes a score based on a simple linear interpolation concept-document score and a concept-user_type score. Perhaps a user_type could be represented with the average of document embeddings for that user and the weight for the two components tuned on a dev set. Alternatively, please consider formulating an appropriate, simpler personalized ranking baseline and comparing to it in addition to the ones in the paper.\n- The paper contains no context on related work from personalized search, it would be useful to make some connection to related prior work.

Why not just fit a simple linear model to the user preferences? \nMany of the design choices in the proposed model are not justified. Why are we modeling the user preference as a a Wishart probability distribution? Why do we need a determinantal point process? How would that compare to random sampling? Et cetera.\n\nThe other issue is the dataset: it's entirely synthetic. There is no evidence that the proposed model would be useful at reflecting real users preferences. If the evaluation had fake data and real users, that would be interesting and such a user study would be illuminating to the proposed work. If the evaluation had real data and fake users (as imagined by an LLM), that might be okay too as LLMs have shown signs that they can model generic user behavior. Ideally the proposed model would be used on real data with user.
