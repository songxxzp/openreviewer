Feed output of the network as a spiking neural network to a classifier. They compare the results of the framework with data from a real organoid system that is placed on a multi-unit stimulation and recording array. They find comparable firing rates when both systems are strongly driven by patterned stimulation, as well as several other metrics such as timing variance.

All of the above have been demonstrated previously, much of it is also cited by the authors, so they do not represent significant contributions. \n\nFurthermore, these technical contributions have little to do with neural organoids: Figure 5 shows that simulated network outputs have similarities to organoid output, thus representing evidence that the in silico model is a model for the organoid in vitro. However, this evidence is unconvincing. Spiking network models, under many parameter configurations, tend to exhibit synchronized network bursts, which the organoids also happen to exhibit naturally. Thus, the fact that they both burst at similar (and a very broad) firing rate is not convincing evidence that the model matches the organoid. More importantly, there are many network model parameters that alter its behavior. The authors explore some of these in the context of classification performance, but not in how well the model matches the organoid\u2014indeed, mechanistic parameter identification based on real data is non-trivial, and significantly more evidence is required to show that the model is similarity to the in vitro system. \n\nFinally, I personally found the text to be quite difficult to understand, not due to low-level grammatical issues, but that it is often written in a manner that does not convey much scientific detail. For example, the abstract reads more like a press release, with very little details regarding the methods and key results, but is rather more focused on conveying the importance of the problem. While I agree that this avenue of research is interesting, it\u2019s ultimately framed inappropriately (in my opinion), and in the present state, the work falls very short of the stated goal of AI-organoid symbiosis."
