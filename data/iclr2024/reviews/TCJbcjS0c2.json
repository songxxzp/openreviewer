This is impractical as all modern wireless systems are digital and data transmission involves channel coding, which is likely incompatible with \"over the air\" averaging. I am aware that this concept has been presented in many papers published in wireless communications journals and conferences, but it is still impractical. It is unlikely that wireless communication standards will incorporate a specific physical layer technique only for the sake of computing averages, which in any foreseeable future represents only a very small fraction of data transmitted in common wireless systems. Moreover, this mechanism restricts the averaging to clients communicating with a single basestation, while in practice, the coverage of a single basestation is quite small and having all the clients connecting to the same basestation is very unlikely.\n- The paper focuses on low-rank compression, which by itself is a known technique. Yet, the result in Theorem 1 and its assumptions seem to be a standard error-feedback result. In particular, Assumption 4 is standard and does not capture anything specific to the fact of using low-rank compression instead of other compression methods such as top-k and random-k. It seems the only difference from standard error-feedback compression analysis is the noise term, which, however, is a straightforward extension. \n- It is not quite clear how power reduction is achieved as shown in the experiments. The power budget is fixed according to Algorithm 1. If there is a fixed power budget, the same budget should apply to both the proposed algorithm and the baselines. The results in Table 1 and Table 3 either do not enforce a fixed power budget, which contradicts with the description in Algorithm 1, or there is something else wrong."

                "value": "I just have a few questions below:\n\n1. In algorithm 1, the local error $e_i$ is only $\\boldsymbol{M}_i - \\text{DECOMPRESS}(\\mathcal{C}_r(\\boldsymbol{M}_i))$, without ever being multiplied by $\\gamma$: is this correct ? It seems that if so, the error may not be compensated correctly ? (I may be mistaken)\n2. If I understand correctly, Assumption 5 is a new assumption introduced in the paper: unless I missed it in the paper, I think it would be good to elaborate a bit further on why such assumption should be verified in the settings considered, theoretically and/or experimentally (or even just with a discussion, just to provide some intuition on why such assumption should be verified): it seems that to verify it, either the compression should be very accurate (i.e. $\\delta_r$ large), or $\\lambda_{\\text{LASER}}$ should be small, but however, while taking a larger $r$ would make $\\delta_r$ larger (more accurate compression), it would also make the bound on $\\lambda_{\\text{LASER}}$ larger, according to eq. (5), therefore it seems a bit unclear whether Assumption 5 can be verified (or how to make it verified in practice).\n3. For the experiments, I believe it would be useful to just recall how one can deal with parameters of DNNs, which are not, per say, 1 matrix: looking into Vogels 2019, it seems that, to do that, the low-rank decompositions are done layer-wise (since each layer can be seen as a matrix, even in the convolutional case), but just a quick recall about this would be useful.\n4. Minor remarks/typos:\n- in 5. \u201cdecompose gradient matrix\u201d -> \u201cdecompose the gradient matrix\u201d\n- In the supplemental, just before D.2: \u201cexperssion\u201d \u2014> \u201cepxression\u201d"

                "value": "The authors present a scheme for efficient and reliable uplink communication over a noisy channel in a federated environment. In particular, clients submit rank factors of the gradients, where owing to the inherent low-rank structure of gradients, reconstruction can be performed reliably server-side, leveraging error-feedback if necessary. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this communication strategy, dubbed LASER, by performing experiments such as an image-classification, a GPT language-modeling task, and a 1-layer NN MNIST task."

To the best of my knowledge, the theory is sound, and all assumptions are fair, with well-cited support regarding the low-rank nature of gradients. \n3. The large-scale GPT-2 experiment was quite impressive. Challenging large-scale language tasks are seldom seen in FL literature."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. In my opinion, this work does not introduce anything truly novel or interesting to the subdomain of communication efficiency. Gradient compression via sketching (Rabbani et al., 2023, Rothchild et al., 2020; Haddadpour et al., 2020), quantization (Zakerinia et al., 2023), and even the blanket consideration of general contraction/compression operators (Dorfman et al., 2023) along with many other works indicate that the research area of uplink efficiency is saturated. Introducing a low-rank decomposition of the gradient as a form of compression is not a particularly novel technique, especially since it is handled under the general error-feedback recovery. Bi-directional compression is a much more challenging and relevant problem in the modern landscape of FL communication efficiency. \n\n2. The following lines concern me: \"Rank compression methods (Yu et al., 2018; Cho et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018) spectrally decompose gradient matrix (often via SVD) and transmit these factors. Since SVD is computationally prohibitive, we rely on the state-of-the-art\nlight-weight compressor PowerSGD (Vogels et al., 2019).\" Since gradient rank decomposition has been performed in distributed settings, using a SoTA method for decomposition is simply a plug-and-play extension which further restricts the novelty of LASER."

                "value": "1. In what scenario would the uplink communication be noisy but the downlink communication would be noiseless? \"For the downlink\ncommunication from the server to the clients (broadcast channel), we assume that it is noiseless and thus the clients exactly receive what the server transmits...\"\n\n2.  (Chang & Tandon, 2020; Guo et al., 2020) imply that clients must first transmit information regarding the norms of their gradients before constructing a power budget policy -- does this imply 2 rounds of communication would be necessary assuming a dynamic power schedule is employed?"
