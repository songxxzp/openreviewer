It is important to balance denoising and preservation of unique user vehaviors : This weakness pertains to the treatment of implicit feedback in the denoising strategy and the Dynamic Noise Reduction (DNR) process within the NARF framework. The concern is that these processes might overly standardize user behavior, potentially leading to the loss of unique and valuable user behavior patterns inherent in implicit feedback. \n\n n the NARF framework, implicit feedback is subjected to a denoising strategy to mitigate the impact of noisy interactions. Implicit feedback, by nature, is derived from user actions such as clicks, views, or purchases, and it encapsulates a wide array of user behavior patterns. These patterns are crucial as they provide unique insights into user preferences and behavior. However, the denoising strategy, as described in the paper, might not sufficiently differentiate between noise and genuine user behavior patterns that are less common or more nuanced. This is particularly evident in the sections of the paper where the authors discuss the implementation of the DNR process.\n\nThe DNR process aims to dynamically reduce noise by focusing on reliable user-item interactions. However, the criteria for determining reliability are primarily based on loss values computed during training. This approach raises the concern that unique user behavior patterns, which might initially result in higher loss values due to their rarity or complexity, could be mistakenly treated as noise and filtered out. This is especially problematic if these unique patterns are crucial for understanding specific user preferences or behavior in niche domains.\n\nFurthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed discussion on how the NARF framework, and specifically the DNR process, handles the trade-off between denoising and preserving the richness of implicit feedback. The lack of this discussion leaves readers questioning whether the framework can adequately capture the diversity of user behavior inherent in implicit feedback, particularly in scenarios with diverse and biased datasets.\n\nIn summary, while the NARF framework aims to improve recommendation performance through denoising strategies, there is a need for a more explicit discussion and concrete examples in the paper to address concerns regarding the potential loss of inherent user behavior patterns in the implicit preferences. This is crucial for ensuring that the benefits of denoising do not come at the expense of overlooking valuable insights that implicit feedback can provide.\n\n2. The cross-domain datasets used in the experiments are all sourced from Amazon, covering domains like movies, music, and books. These domains are relatively similar, and the use of more diverse and biased datasets could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.\n\n3. It is imperative to maintain a consistent use of terminology when expressing the substitution of DNR with CTD in the ablation study, ensuring clarity and precision in communication. For instance, in Table 4, the term 'CTD' is utilized, whereas in the main model description sections, such as in Figure 3, the term 'DNR' is employed. This discrepancy necessitates attention to ensure consistency and avoid potential confusion for readers."

The proposed framework (CDRIF) addresses the first issue by existing sampling strategies, i.e., uniform sampling (Rendle et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2020). And CDRIF addresses the second issue by existing denoising algorithms, i.e., adaptive denoising and co-teaching denoising (Wang et al., 2021b; Han et al., 2018).

The proposed framework (CDRIF) consists of three core components, i) generating negative samples, ii) reducing noise, iii) reweighting by calibration factors. However, the first component directly uses the existing uniform sampling (Rendle et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2020). The second component directly uses existing denoising algorithms, i.e., adaptive denoising and co-teaching denoising (Wang et al., 2021b; Han et al., 2018). The third component is a very simple item popularity-based calibration. \n\nW2: The evaluation is very weak. There are only two baselines, EMCDR (Man et al., 2017) and PTUPCDR (Zhu et al., 2022). For cross-domain recommendation (CDR) methods (applicable for both explicit and implicit feedback), there are so many advanced learning techniques, just name a few bellows: graph neural networks based CDR, transfer learning based CDR, attention mechanism based CDR, adversarial learning based CDR. \n\nW3: Many related works are ignored. Also, see the above weak W2. In detail, transfer learning is a main research thread to address the cross-domain recommendation (for both explicit and implicit feedback). For example, the CoNet method (Collaborative Cross Networks for Cross-Domain Recommendation) can address the cross-domain recommendation from implicit feedback as investigated in this ICLR submission. In its task setting on the Cheetah Mobile dataset, it recommends apps (the target domain) by exploiting knowledge from news reading history (the source domain). Obviously, the reading logs are implicit feedback and the installations of apps are also implicit feedback. As a result, the claim in the introduction \u201cto the best of our knowledge, prior to our study, no existing CDR research has offered algorithms to handle implicit feedback scenarios\u201d does not hold true.\n\nW4: the newly introduced dataset is not detailed. I read the Appendix A.2 for the dataset description on PubMed and DBLP. I checked the web pages on PubMed and DBLP, but I still do not know: How to align the authors on these two domains (name disambiguation)? Where to get the topic identification of an author? Why use the topic as the items and what is the reason to recommend a topic to an author? Why not use the {venue, paper/references, potential co-author et al} as the items instead? Is any data sample to be shown? By the way, will this dataset be released to use for research purposes? What is the cleaning, filtering, and preprocessing detail for this newly introduced dataset?"
