In any self-supervised paradigm, one must find a way to add labels during the fine-tuning process; here, that problem is solved by using masked spectrograms as pseudo-labels during pre-training, then replacing those with actual labels (noisy speech, mixed speech, or phone sequences) during fine-tuning.  The idea of using masked spectrograms to condition flow was also used in the VoiceBox flow synthesizer, but that paper did not include a self-supervised pre-training stage."

The combination of these two ideas (flow-based TTS and pre-trained TTS) was not proposed in any paper I can find.  The new contribution of this manuscript, the use of generative flow in a self-supervised pre-training stage, is an elegant idea that forms a strong theoretical paradigm, and that is supported by strong experimental results compared to challenging baselines."
