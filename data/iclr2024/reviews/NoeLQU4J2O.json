                "value": "This paper proposes a set of technique to realize an implementation of neural networks that are as simple as binary neural networks. Rather than binarization, the authors use hashing functions, inspired from earlier works that have considered filtering techniques. The novelty proposed by the authors is to slightly modify the gradient formulation for back-propagation. A problem with regular STE convergence is identified when using ULEEN, whereby the use of minimum function causes a bottleneck. As an alternative, the authors propose to use the sum function for approximating AND resulting in an always 1 gradient. Experimental results on tiny datasets are provided."

However, very little is done to measure this complexity. Only the model size is reported, as proxy to complexity. But what about the overhead of implementing hashing and filtering? How does that compare to regular binarization where values are simply clipped to +/-1? How does that compare to low bit width implementation (e.g., 4-bit or 8-bit)? I found the discussion on hardware benefits and limitations of the method very weak.\n\n-- The utilized benchmarks are extremely trivial. The authors have only tested their work on tiny models and datasets. Does the method work on models more relevant to the community in this day and age? E.g., large vision and language models? Even for those tiny datasets, the accuracy is not even close to the state-of-the-art, such as for CIFAR-10 where the authors report accuracies close to 50%."
