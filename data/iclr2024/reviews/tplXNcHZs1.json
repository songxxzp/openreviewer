To overcome this difficulty, this paper introduces a diffusion process to the measurement vector and incorporates the information of the measurement by Bayesian filtering methods in the backward process.  In the ideal case, the exactness of the proposed method is theoretically guaranteed, which is realized by the sequential Monte Carlo method using infinitely many particles. Numerical experiments show that the performance of the method is as good as those of the SOTA methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- I believe that method proposed in the paper is technically flawed. In the section 3 of the main paper, the authors give the state space model that they consider where notably, the use the same noise at step $k$ for both the observation and the state. They then proceed to claim that it holds that $p(x_0 | y_0) = \\int p(x_0 | y_{0:N}) p(y_{1:N} | y_0) \\mathrm{d}y_{1:N}$ and thus, to sample from $p(x_0 | y_0)$ it is enough to sample $p(y_{1:N} | y_0)$ and then sample from $p(x_0 | y_{0:n})$ using an SMC algorithm. However, this is not correct since $p(x_0 | y_{0:N}) = p(x_0 | y_0)$ for the state model that they consider. To show that this is the case, consider the case $N=1$. Then, the joint distribution of the SSM they consider is the following, since they share the noise: \n$$\np(y_{0:1}, x_{0:1}) = p(y_0 | x_0) p(x_0) \\int p(\\mathrm{d} z) \\delta_{a_1 x_0 + b_1 z} (x_1)   \\delta_{a_1 y_0 + b_1 A z} (y_1)\n$$\nand thus, \n$$\np(x_0 | y_{0:1}) = \\frac{\\int p(y_{0:1}, x_{0:1}) \\mathrm{d} x_{1}}{\\int p(y_{0:1}, x_{0:1}) \\mathrm{d} x_{1} \\mathrm{d} x_0} = \\frac{p(y_0 |\u00a0x_0) p(x_0) p(y_1 | y_0)}{\\int p(y_0 |\u00a0x_0) p(x_0) p(y_1 | y_0) \\mathrm{d} x_0} = p(x_0 | y_0)\n$$\nBesides this fact, the methodology developed in the rest of the paper does not in fact sample from the correct posterior asymptotically. To see why this is the case, note that the state space model on which the authors apply SMC is the following: \n$$ \np_\\theta(x_{0:N}, y_{0:N}) = p_N(y_N | x_N) p_N(x_N) \\prod_{s = 0}^{N-1} p_\\theta(x_s | x_{s+1}) p(y_s | x_s) \n$$ \nIt is straightforward to see that the p_\\theta(x_0\u00a0| y_0) resulting from this model is **not** the target posterior $p^*(x_0 | y_0) \\propto p(y_0 | x_0) p_\\theta(x_0)$.  \n\n- The idea of using the same noise for the forward process and the observations is not new and is used in [1], which the authors cite but they fail to mention that they use the same idea. The authors also fail to mention author work on SMC applied to diffusion posterior sampling [2]. In fact in this paper the authors use a specific decomposition of the posterior, similar to what is claimed in the text box at the end of the section 3 of this paper. In contrast, their decomposition is theoretically justified but holds under stringent assumptions on the backward process, further confirming that what is claimed in this paper is not true. \n\n- Finally, this paper is not the first one to develop a consistent diffusion posterior sampling algorithm, see [3] and [4] which develop **principled** SMC algorithms for asympotitcally exact posterior sampling. This is not a criticism, as these papers have been released 3/4 months ago and I understand that the authors may not have had knowledge of them. \n\n\n[1] Song, Yang, et al. \"Solving inverse problems in medical imaging with score-based generative models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.08005 (2021).\n\n[2] Trippe, Brian L., et al. \"Diffusion probabilistic modeling of protein backbones in 3d for the motif-scaffolding problem.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.04119 (2022).\n\n[3]\u00a0Wu, Luhuan, et al. \"Practical and asymptotically exact conditional sampling in diffusion models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.17775 (2023).\n\n[4] Cardoso, Gabriel, et al. \"Monte Carlo guided Diffusion for Bayesian linear inverse problems.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.07983 (2023)."
