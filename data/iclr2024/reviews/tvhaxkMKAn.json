            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "After digging into the paper's experiments, I found myself with more questions and confusion than answers and clarity. I feel that this paper does not do a good job of working towards an understanding of the phenomenon of sycophancy in language models. I detail my reasoning for this below:\n\n\n### *Regarding Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models*\n\nThe paper is titled \u201cTowards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models\u201d, and their experiments center around how RLHF can contribute to sycophancy. However, prior work [1,2] has observed sychophancy in both pretrained and supervised fine-tuned language models. Even many of this paper's own results \u2013 in particular in section 4.2 \u2013 indicate that without any optimization at all (best-of-N or RLHF) there is still a non-trivial level of sychophancy, as measured by their benchmarks, further suggesting that sychopancy may also come from pretraining or SFT. However, the paper chooses to ignore these other possibilities and instead decides to push a narrative entirely focused on RLHF. As a result, the paper paints a very incomplete and biased picture of a seemingly very complicated and nuanced problem.\n\n### *Regarding The Evaluations in Section 3*\n\nOf the four evaluation tasks presented in section 3, three of them involve a notion of a ground truth correct answer (in particular, the tasks presented in sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4). I feel that the objective nature of these tasks presents somewhat of a confounder. In particular, you could imagine that if a language model is fairly uncertain about what the correct answer is for a given question, it would be rational for the model to use the user's suggestion to adjust its beliefs about what the correct answer could be. Of course the model should not completely trust the user, but I think there is a nuanced and interesting question here about how much a model should trust the user when the model is highly uncertain, and at what point a behavior should be considered sycophantic (i.e. is it only when the model is \"highly confident\" about the correct answer and they still choose to follow the user's bias towards the wrong answer). However the paper's evaluations largely ignore this consideration, with the exception of the experiment in section 3.2 which does take the model's uncertainty into account. It would be great if the experiments in sections 3.3 and 3.4 could present a similar analysis taking into account the model's uncertainty. Such an analysis would greatly increase my confidence that their evaluations are actually measuring sycophantic behavior as they claim they are.\n\n### *Regarding the Experiment in Section 4.1*\n\nIn section 4.1, the claims made about Figure 5 are very carefully worded, which is great. However, the figure itself suggests the conclusion that \"matches user beliefs\" is the most predictive feature of user preference, which I'm unsure is true. After digging into the details of this experiment, it is far from clear to me that this is the case for a few reasons:\n1. If you have many correlated features, then the logistic regression weights assigned to them may get spread out across the features. And if some features have more correlations than others, then any conclusions drawn from the effect sizes may be impacted by these correlations. In fact, the collinearities observed in the correlation matrix in Figure 17 suggest that something like this may occurring and it may be worth further investigating this. They admit this in the appendix, but I think it is important to either point out this issue more clearly in the text or try to resolve it.\n2. It is likely that some of the features, like \u201ctruthfulness\u201d, may be harder for GPT-4 to accurately generate than others. If certain features are noisier than others due to GPT-4's uncertainty, it would impact the effect sizes.\n3. The process of how they selected the set of features that they did in addition to the specific features themselves could have a big impact on their results due to confounders like those discussed in 1) and 2). It is likely that many features could be just as predictive as the ones that they selected, such as the length of the response [3], making it unclear to me why they chose these features and not others. However, nowhere in the paper do they explain how they arrived at these specific features.\n\nOverall, looking closely at this experiment, it is pretty difficult for me to conclude anything too meaningful due to the confounders mentioned and the lack of clarity provided by the paper. I would recommend the authors conduct further analysis in this experiment to tease apart some of these issues. However, once again, I will admit that I think the specific claims that they make in the text are not entirely unreasonable: it does seem that the feature \"matching users beliefs\" is at least somewhat useful for predicting user preferences, but it is very unclear to me that this is the most predictive feature as their figure suggests.\n\n### *Regarding the Experiments in Section 4.3*\n\nSection 4.3 claims that \u201cPMs sometimes prefer sychophonic responses\u201d. While I think that this is a reasonable claim considering the evidence that is given, I feel that the experiments may be ignoring some nuances which may complicate the results presented and the conclusions drawn from them. I outline my reasoning below:\n\nFirstly, the task that they construct for this experiment has different difficulty levels, which are determined based on how well Claude 2 is able to classify the truthful answer from a prompt. Therefore the higher difficulty levels, may primarily be measuring how the PM ranks responses in which it fundamentally doesn\u2019t know the truth about, since I'm assuming the PM is based off of Claude 2's base model. In particular, if the PM fundamentally doesn\u2019t know the truth it seems like it would be difficult to claim that this behavior is \u201csycophancy\u201d, since it is no longer deliberate: the PM has no choice but to prefer one answer over another but if it fundamentally doesn\u2019t know the answer then it might as well just guess, which would mean that roughly 50% of the time \"sycophantic answers\" would be preferred (this is roughly what we see in the highest difficulty level plot). It is possible however that even for the highest difficulty levels the model was still reasonably confident about the true answer, and so if this is the case, then my critique here would be no longer valid. Therefore, I would by curious to see how the difficulty bins were calculated.\n\nSecondly, in this section they do not explain what their \"non-sycophantic PM\" baseline is. Digging through the appendix, section D.4 suggests, that this \u201cnon-sychophantic PM\u201d is just the oracle which always selects a truthful response if it exists. This is arguably an unfair baseline because once again the pretained LM may fundamentally not know the truthful answer to some of the more difficult instances of this task, which would mean that their baseline significantly overestimates what could be reasonably expected by a good \u201cnon-sychopanic\u201d PM fine-tuned from the Claude 2 base model. So if the assumptions that I'm making are true (the authors should tell me), then it is therefore entirely possible that their current Claude 2 PM is actually doing very well on this task, relative to what can be reasonably expected. However, the plots that they present in figures 7.C and 7.D, do not lead to this conclusion. Rather, they present the conclusion that the Claude 2 PM is doing rather poorly at deterring sycophancy. As a result, I think these experiments are presenting an incomplete and possibly misleading picture of the much more complex reality at play here.\n\n### *Regarding the Writing*\n\nFinally, I would like to note that in addition to the above critiques of the paper\u2019s content, I believe that the paper\u2019s writing is also not very polished.\n\n[1]: [Simple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03958)\n\n[2]: [Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251)\n\n[3]: [A Long Way to Go: Investigating Length Correlations in RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03716)"

I\u2019m assuming \u201call else equal\u201d means that all other features are zero except for the one under consideration, which is 1. And the median of this probability is reported, across all posterior samples. However it would be great if this could be clarified.\n* Do you skip a certain number of warmup samples when doing the MCMC for your Bayesian logistic regression?\n* How exactly do you detect the attributions for the poems eval? Is it exact string match or something else? I couldn\u2019t find this detail in the appendix.\n* Was the Claude 2 preference model trained on the data analyzed in 4.1?\n* In 4.3.2 it would be interesting to see how much RLHF reduces sycophancy, in addition to the re-ranking experiments presented. It seems plausible that RLHF will more greatly reduce sycophancy than re-ranking. Since RL incentives optimizing expected reward across all prompts, the policy may generalize to learning to avoid any behaviors which it thinks has even a small chance of being penalized by the RM. For example, if sycophancy is only penalized 40% of the time by the RM, the policy may learn to avoid sycophancy 100% of the time as a result of the RLHF training objective.\n* Why isn\u2019t the y-axis value for the left-most points of the lines in Figure (6.B) the same as the y-axis value for the N=1 point  on the corresponding Figure (6.A) plot? Shouldn\u2019t these both correspond to the raw helpful-only Claude 1.3\u2019s sycophancy metric without any optimization? Why are they different?"

                "value": "This paper studies sycophancy in LLMs, with a particular focus on the role of RLHF and preference data. This is done in several steps: (1) conducting multiple evaluations to demonstrate various sycophantic behaviors in sota AI assistants, (2) studying sycophancy in preference datasets, (3) measuring the role of the reward model in inducing/reducing sycophancy through RLHF/BoN sampling, (4) analyzing human preferences of sycophantic responses. \n\n(1) To demonstrate sycophantic behavior in sota AI assistants, the following experiments are conducted.\n(3.1) Demonstrates that LLMs respond with \"more positive\" feedback when the prompt indicates the user likes the text, and less positive when the user indicates they dislike the text. Weaker results for \"wrote the text\" vs \"didn't write the text\". GPT-4 used to measure feedback positivity.\n(3.2) Demonstrates that LLMs typically apologize/change answer when challenged. Across the 5 LLMs evaluated, there is a moderate-high frequency of changing from a correct to incorrect answer.\n(3.3) Demonstrates that suggesting the wrong answer can reduce accuracy\n(3.4) Demonstrates that responses will mimic/repeat user mistakes. When users present incorrect assumptions in the prompt (about the author of a poem), the LLM will not challenge the assumption.\n\n(2) To study the role of preference data in incentivizing/inducing sycophancy, the following experiment is conducted:\n(i) A set of response pairs is obtained from the Anthropic hh-rlhf preference dataset.\n(ii) GPT-4 is used (zero-shot) classify the response pairs into 23 dimensions, e.g. \"ResponseA is more authoritative than ResponseB\" -> (-1,0,1). \n(iii) A logistic regression trained on these 23 features achieves a holdout accuracy of 71.3% on the hh-rlhf dataset (competitive with large RMs), suggesting that these features are accurate and contain meaningful signal about human preference. \n(iv) Analyzing the impact of each feature (by holding all other features equal), the paper shows that logistic regression model prioritizes features like \"matches users beliefs\" and \"authoritative\". Interestingly, truthfulness (albeit as judged by gpt4) is also an impactful feature.\n\n(3) To study the role of preference models in incentivizing/inducing sycophancy, the following experiment is conducted:\n(i) Two different preference models are considered: the claude2 PM and 'non sycophantic PM' (prompt requests truthful responses). \n(ii) 3 sycophancy experiments are used to evaluate: (3.1) feedback, (3.2) answer and (3.4) mimicry.\n(iv) For BoN, between 1-32 responses are considered + the PM is used to select the best one. As N increases, the response is more optimized to the PM. There is an increase of feedback sycophancy with Claude2 PM, but not on answer or mimicry.\n(v) Different stages of RLHF training are considered (with the Claude2 PM). There is an increase of mimicry and feedback sycophancy, but not answer sycophancy. \n\n(4) To study whether humans and PMs prefer incorrect+sycophantic over truthful responses:\n(i) A dataset of misconceptions is created using existing sources and GPT4. The probability to each misconception by Claude2 is used to categorize these into 8 difficulty levels.\n(ii) Three types of responses are considered: baseline human-written responses, helpful truthful responses (verbose), sycophantic incorrect responses. \n(iii) The Claude2 preference model prefers the sycophantic response over the baseline a substantial portion of the time, across all levels of difficulty. However, the helpful+truthful response is preferred more often -- except for the hardest misconceptions (as scored by Claude2).\n(iv) Humans do typically prefer the truthful responses over the sycophantic ones, but for the hardest misconceptions - 35% of sycophantic responses are preferred.\n\nIn summary, there are six main takeaways from the experiments in this paper:\n(i) AI assistants exhibit sycophantic behavior (feedback, answer, mimicry), (ii) analyzing preference data with GPT4 shows that sycophantic responses are preferred in human preference data, (iii) Claude2 PM is shown to decrease sycophancy through BoN sampling, except for feedback sycophancy, (iv) Claude2 is shown to increase mimicry/feedback sycophancy through RLHF, (v) Claude2 PM prefers verbose sycophantic responses over short truthful responses, but prefers verbose truthful responses the most, (vi) both Claude2 PM and humans struggle with the most challenging misconceptions."

                "value": "This is an interesting paper that applies novel methodology to assess and study sycophancy. Some specific strengths:\n\n- Demonstrating sycophancy in existing AI assistants was done in a comprehensive manner, with consideration for various different variations of sycophancy and domains. This is a valuable scientific contribution both due to the results and the methodology.\n\n- The analysis in 4.1 is the strongest contribution of this paper and very interesting. The results convincingly demonstrate sycophancy is an important/impactful dimension of human preference in the hh-rlhf dataset. I do have slight concerns about whether GPT4 can accurately classify all of the features, but it's clear from the 71%+ holdout accuracy that there is sufficient signal in these feature predictions.\n\n- This paper is thorough and considers several different aspects, from preference data, to RMs, to human annotators, etc. Though there is some discontinuity between the data/PM, it is still valuable and insightful to see such an end-to-end analysis."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Two weaknesses:\n\n(1) The abstract/introduction are focused on RLHF, but the paper does little to specifically measure the impacts of RLHF beyond assessing preference data/preference models. For example:\n\n(i) There is no comparative study of pre-RLHF and post-RLHF LMs. If the claim of the paper is that \"RLHF induces sycophancy\", it would be great to see a comparison of pre/post-RLHF models (perhaps with different RMs). This is presented in Fig6b, but should be extended to Sec3 and be a more central argument of the paper.\n\n(ii) Since what a model learns during RLHF is influenced by (a) the RM/PM, (b) prompt set, (c) exploration of the model (e.g., temperature) -- it is insufficient to study the impact of RLHF through ONLY the lens of the RM/PM, etc. For example, if there are no prompts during RLHF that may induce sycophancy, will the resulting model learn sycophantic behavior even with a sycophantic RM? It would be great to include analyses or discussion about this OR mention it as an explicit limitation of this work. \n\n(iii) A specific case of (ii) that requires special consideration: In Sec4.3 (Fig7a), the PM is used to compare baseline truthful vs sycophantic vs helpful/verbose truthful. The results shows that sycophantic >> baseline, but verbose truthful >> sycophantic. I don't think this result can be used to argue that the PM is inducing sycophancy through RLHF/etc. In practice, an RM/PM can be hyper-specialized and only perform accurately in the narrow space of LLM outputs. I.e., if the LLM never produces a response that resembles the baseline, and only produces verbose responses, it isn't important for the PM to classify this accurately.\n\n(iv) BoN sampling is used as an alternative (approximation?) for RLHF. Though BoN clearly optimizes against the PM, I don't believe this is a reasonable substitute for RLHF. Ideally all of the BoN experiments would be replaced by/augmented with RLHF experiments (using the same PM), but this may be impractical. At the least, it would be useful to include discussion about the differences in behavior between RLHF and BoN sampling (e.g., for Fig6, or Fig7c,d)\n\n\n(2) The discontinuity between 4.1 and 4.2/4.3 is a weakness. It would be ideal to report the sycophancy of a PM trained on the same hh-rlhf dataset that was analyzed in 4.1. The analysis in 4.1 is very insightful and significant, and it would be valuable to expand this more. For example, could the GPT-4 feature extraction approach be used to filter the dataset and lead to a less sycophantic PM?\n\n(3: nit) Though it is generally fine to use LLMs for annotation, I'm worried that there might be some issues due to mis-predictions from GPT4 (for feature extraction in 4.1)/Claude2 (for misconception difficulty). I think this is unlikely to be a significant issue, but might be worth to mention in the paper. For example: (i) If GPT4 is mispredicting which response is truthful in 4.1, it would impact the analysis, (ii) using Claude2 probabilities to classify how challenging misconceptions means that it's not that surprising that Claude struggles more on those samples."
