This problem has been considered in the machine learning literature which often does not take into account the different symmetries of neural network parameters, or only considers simple and fixed architectures such as multi-layer perceptrons or convolutional neural networks (Navon et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a). The paper extends those works and proposes a more flexible approach where different architectures of neural networks can be given as input their neural network (i.e. different number of layers, widths, non-linearities). The paper also considers other types of layers such as residual connections and normalizations that take respect permutation equivariance across the different layers."

This is achieved by representing the input neural network as a graph. In doing so, a graph neural network can operate on the input graph while respecting parameter permutation symmetries.\n\nThe neural network is converted to a graph by the introduction of a neural graph representation. This neural graph representation is related to the computation graph, but is more compact in some cases. Neural graph representations are designed for MLPs, CNNs, and residual networks. As part of the neural graph representation, the papers introduce novel node and edge features that improve the expressivity of the graph neural networks.\n\nThe proposed method is evaluated over a diverse set of experiments: classifying implicit neural representations, predicting network generalization, and learning to optimize. Across all settings, the proposed method significantly outperforms the evaluated baselines."

I was able to follow completely and feel that adequate detail was provided for me to reproduce the results. \n\nThe empirical evaluation is thorough and conclusive. The proposed method gives a significant boost to performance over the baselines. The paper evaluates performance over several established tasks. There is a good amount of variety and error bars are included for all experiments, further establishing the consistent benefits. The authors also included full source code for their method and experiments.\n\nI feel that the contributions of this work are significant overall. This is a nice approach to designing neural networks that process other neural networks, which alleviates some of the complexity in prior work."

                "value": "The CNN graph construction is effective but feels quite hacky. To use the method, the user must first specify a maximum kernel size. While this is unlikely to be a problem in practice, because the kernel size of modern CNNs does not vary much, it is not obvious how to extend this to other network layers that exhibit parameter sharing. For example, attention layers share parameters over sequence length which may vary significantly more than kernel size. Moreover, other standard building blocks like normalization layers are not covered in this work and there is no clear recipe provided for designing the corresponding neural graph representations.\n\nThere is little theoretical justification for the proposed approach. Prior work proves the expressivity of their methods alongside their group equivariance properties. Neither of these are explored formally in this work.\n\nI consider the empirical results to be quite complete, but an ablation of the various design decisions introduced would be valuable. For example, I'd like to better understand how much value the probe features, non-linearity identification, positional encoding, and other components contribute to the overall performance."

Are you able to outline how this might be proved?\n- Related to the previous question, the authors write that \"natural symmetries in the neural graphs correspond exactly to neuron permutation symmetries\", is this a statement that can be formalized? It is not clear to me that this is a 1:1 correspondence for all graphs considered. However, it is stated that this can be shown (Sec 2.1).\n- You observe that the baseline methods are able to perform equally well on the training loss, but fail to generalize as well (Sec 4.1). Why do you think this is? Did you explore adding regularization or similar to the baseline methods to help with generalization? I wonder if the probe features or other modifications are providing some of this benefit for the proposed method.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- I thought the probe features is a very neat idea that, intuitively, adds a lot of expressive power to the proposed method.\n- At the end of the introduction, it is written that the proposed method \"outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin\". I think perhaps this would be better quantified with some specific values.\n- In Section 2.3, non-linearities are described as being added to the node features. Is this done via concatenation? And what is done when there is no activation?"
