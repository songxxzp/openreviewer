For evaluation, the proposed framework uses GPT4 to evaluate the answer or the execution paths, which potentially has two issues: 1. GPT4 is a commercial tool, which may limit the potential use of this environment; 2. GPT4 is not guaranteed to be 100% right, which may make the evaluation results not convincing.\n\n3. The success rate of human on the designed tasks are only 78%, which is a little surprising since it seems that these tasks are not that difficult for human to complete. It is better that the authors provide more analysis on these tasks and evaluations to show that why human fails and if these tasks are too difficult for agents."

Also, little to no details about how the agent was implemented/tested are given in the main paper. Only the appendix shows examples, which impedes understanding the paper.\n\nAs the used LLMs for the evaluation are closed-source, this impedes reproduciability.

Testing with agents, including a GPT-4-based one, showed a significant performance gap, with the agent achieving only a 14.41% success rate compared to humans at 78.24%.

                "value": "While the work presented is undeniably valuable, from an academic perspective, I believe there are several weaknesses, primarily related to experimental evaluations and the choice of baselines. Here are the specific areas of concern:\n\n1. **Lack of Evaluation with the Latest Intelligent Agents**: \n\nThe paper seems to miss out on evaluating some of the latest intelligent agents, especially those grounded in modern reasoning and planning methods. Works like the \"Tree of Thought\" and the new \"Reflection\" architecture have been in the public domain for a while. It would have greatly enhanced the paper's comprehensiveness if these contemporary agents were included in the evaluations.\n\n2. **API Call Methodology and Ablation Experiments**: \n\nThe manner in which API calls are presented in the paper, particularly as web pages, does not seem to align with the current prevalent paradigms where APIs are usually invoked within context. It raises the question of whether an agent can effectively utilize this format. Additionally, it would have been illuminating if the authors had included ablation studies in their experiments. Specifically, it would be insightful to discern the efficacy of these tools and whether they genuinely aid the agent in realizing the desired goal of \"encouraging human-like task-solving\".\n\n3. **Html or Accessibility Tree?** \n   - Many language models (LLMs) are pre-trained with an abundance of HTML content, but they might not necessarily contain the Accessibility tree. Hence, it might be more natural for these LLMs to understand and parse HTML.\n   - Both DOM and the Accessibility tree adopt a tree-like structure. The seemingly \"redundant\" symbols in HTML could potentially assist LLMs in better understanding the hierarchical nature of the content.\n   - It is vital to conduct empirical tests to validate the advantages of either approach. Given that the Accessibility tree is not commonly adopted in other benchmarks, using it here could also be viewed as one of the paper's core contributions, setting it apart from the current landscape of research in this area.\n\n4. **Gold Trajectories**: \n\nThe paper would benefit significantly from the inclusion of \"Gold\" trajectories. These trajectories can offer a benchmark for the best possible action sequences, making them an invaluable asset for future research in this domain. The absence of these trajectories is a noticeable gap in the paper.\n\n5. **Evaluator Demographics**: The choice of computer science graduate students as evaluators raises certain concerns regarding the generalizability of the results.\n   - Computer science graduate students typically possess an advanced understanding of web page interactions, which might not be representative of the average user. Their performance might be notably better than what we'd observe with a more diverse group, especially when considering common tasks like online shopping that even non-technical users frequently engage in.\n   - Furthermore, it's essential to address potential biases that might arise if any of the evaluators were involved in the dataset's creation. This could compromise the validity of the scores. From a personal standpoint, I, along with several colleagues, have engaged in case studies with this dataset. Interestingly, our accuracy rates didn't match the high scores reported in the paper, which adds a touch of humor to this serious concern.\n\nTo ensure the paper's robustness and generalizability, it's crucial to address these points, preferably with empirical evidence and further discussions."
