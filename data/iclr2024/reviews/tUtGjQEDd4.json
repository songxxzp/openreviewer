The framework demonstrates the capability to generate realistic data points at an early stage of dynamics propagation, which sets the stage for efficient data generation by leveraging additional velocity information along the trajectory. The model yields favorable performance over baselines in the regime of small Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs) and rivals the performance of diffusion models equipped with efficient sampling techniques."

Qualitative results also show the better ability of AGM to make sampling hops and recover the denoised images at an early stage compared to CLD. \n3. The presentation of the work is also of high quality. The introduction of the theoretical results is concise but also critical to motivate the proposal of AGM.

First, the optimal acceleration function is derived to the solution of the stochastic bridge problem, which is given by minimizing the SOC objective function. Different from CLD whose velocity field is defined by the score function of the pre-defined critically-damped Langevin diffusion process, the velocity field of AGM is learned to rectify the particle trajectory. This SOC problem is designed to minimize the distance between the ground-truth (GT) destination and the trajectory destination. Then like in CLD, this paper took advantage of the momentum-based approaches and proposed that the sampling-hop, the estimated data point $x_1$ given the early sampling stage outputs, is predicted more accurately compared to existing methods. In the empirical experiments, the sampling quality is improved especially in the low-NFE regime."

Both this method and CLD make predictions of the data from both the current state and the velocity, while the compared EDM (Figure 2) does it from state alone.\n  - In the Probabilistic ODE part of (7), an additional notation rather than $g(t)$ is recommended to be used, like $g_t \\to h_t$ in the matrix notation and $g(t)=h_t$ for BM-SDE part. Because the notation $g(t)$ or $g_t$ is abused, it can be misleading that the score term of the probabilistic ODE is neglected.\n* The SOC theorem is only used limitedly; the regularization in terms of $\\int ||a_t||^2$ is ignored and this can threaten the stability of the acceleration space, even though this is not directly revealed in the paper.\n* Whereas the theoretical background is sound and the improved performance is guaranteed, the hyperparameters such as the diffusion coefficients and the SDEs are not optimized, which causes its lacking performance compared to EDM (look at Figure 5).

While this paper works only the simple case of the SOC (no regularization case), introducing some details, or at least some introductory materials will help the readers to follow up the backgrounds.\n* I guess that the ImageNet64 performance is not yet optimized: the generative performance of the SoTA models are expected to be much better than the paper have proposed.
