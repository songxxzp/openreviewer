                "value": "The authors tackle the task of inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell RNA sequencing (*scRNA-seq*) data, which is made difficult by the fact that *scRNA-seq* data showcases many zero values, which are either due to technical reasons (dropouts) or biological (no gene expression). This missing data problem can lead to overly-dense graphs being produced by SOTA causal discovery algorithms applied to this task. The authors propose a `Causal Dropout Model` to characterize the dropout mechanism and come up with a simple solution to handle dropouts, namely conditioning on non-zero entries in the conditioning set when performing conditional independence sets. They show that this approach is sound under relatively mild assumptions and performs well on a large number of synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data sets."

Finally, the authors showcase the performance of their approach in an extensive series of experiments, in which they examine different dropout mechanisms, different causal discovery and GRN inference-specific algorithms, on multiple settings and types of data."

The reference in Nandy et al. (2018) shows this connection, but does not say anything about the assumptions made in the GES paper. Could you elaborate on this point?\n2. On page 7, what do you mean by \"identifiability upper bound\" for identifying the dropout mechanisms? How is this upper bound characterized?\n3. Perhaps I missed it, but in Theorem 2, what is the \"one particular case\" in which Z_i and Z_j are non-adjacent in the underlying GRN.\n4. In Figure 4(b), how do you explain that testwise deletion performs better than the oracle? Shouldn't that be the best case scenario?\n5. I haven't seen *causal sufficiency* mentioned anywhere, which is an important assumption made when using algorithms like PC and GES. Is it reasonable for this type of data to assume that there are no hidden confounders? In either case, I would say something about this important practical limitation."

As far as I can tell, non-zero values might also be technical due to sequencing/mapping/algorithmic errors, correct? \n- Supposing elevated dropout rates of, say 50%, the method relies on the fact that a conditioning variable can be found which \"breaks\" dependencies. Is this correct?\n- Using Fisher's $z$-test assumes multivariate Gaussianity. Wouldn't a kernel-based independence test be better for the log-normal data?\n- Figure 5 is not very readable. I believe a simple table or something similar could improve the presentation.\n- The source code could be improved and properly documented (What libraries are required? Which versions of the libraries did you use for validation? How do I run all experiments? Etc etc.)."
