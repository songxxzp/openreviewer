The authors propose the TwinS model, which consists of three modules: Wavelet Convolution, Period-Aware Attention, and Channel-Temporal Mixed MLP. The Wavelet Convolution handles nested periodicity for time series embedding, the Period-Aware Attention models the periodic distributions at refined receptive fields, and the Channel-Temporal Mixed MLP learns the representation within time series patches across different variates. TwinS achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight datasets compared to mainstream time series models."

The paper is not well-written, especially because some key concepts are not elaborated, such as periodic missing states, hysteresis, and non-stationary periodic distribution. Besides, some abbreviations are not informal and inappropriately used (dim, Conv, TS, TSformers), and the figures are not portable. Thus, this paper essentially needs further polishing. \n2. The method part can be difficult to follow. In the last paragraph of Section 3.1, I still don't know how the input is embedded into the outputted representation because it is almost separated from the previous paragraph only introducing the relationship between transforms and convolutional layers. I hope the authors can elaborate more on it.\n3. The proposed framework somewhat lacks novelty. Both wavelet analysis and patching by windows are previously used techniques for analyzing time series. The author does not compare other modular designs of related work like FEDformer. The overall architecture seems a refinement of Crossformer (What is the difference between Channel-Temporal Mixed MLP and FFN in Crossformer?) but endowed with a higher computational cost.\n4. Unclear motivations. As non-stationarity is commonly reflected by changing distribution statistics, in particular, its mean, variance, or temporal covariance varies over time. This paper focuses more on the changing periodic distribution issues, which are not well-acknowledged to stem from non-stationarity but the inherent properties of the time series itself. Could the author give more examples of the periodic distribution in highly non-stationary series and relatively stationary series?\n5. About the experiment parts. The performance improvement of non-stationary forecasting seems incremental. And the model can also perform worse than previous models on highly non-stationary data (Exchange). Also, the authors offer two variants of the model, but only solely one of the proposed models does not yield consistent promising results, indicating that model selection is inevitable in practical applications. Besides, The analysis of the model is not systematic enough. Some experiments (Tables 2,3,4) only use the results on partial datasets.  It seems there is cherry-picking in particular configurations. Could the authors provide more complete results?\n6. I find the code implementation is incorporated with re-normalization, Channel-Independence, and Patchfy strategies but are not shown in Fig.2 and the method part. Since each of them can work as a general performance booster, how much do these techniques help the model, and is it dominant?"

For example, which component contributes to handling periodic distributions in non-stationary time series forecasting? I would appreciate more clarifications on the effects of each component of the proposed model.\n\n2. The discovery of periodic distributions, including multiple nested and overlapping periods, in non-stationary time series is not a novel concept. From a theoretical standpoint, Kuznetsov, Vitaly, and Mehryar Mohri [1] have already established generalization bounds by leveraging periodic distributions. On a practical note, Zhang and Zhou [2] employed a two-step approach for prediction, selectively ensembling periodic patterns. These prior studies, along with their variations, should be discussed or even compared within the context of this paper.\n\nCertainly, with the progression of time and technology, there's an intuitive inclination to employ large models to tackle complex problems. However, this doesn't imply that we should resort to a completely black-box or consequential approach. It's crucial to comprehend why the traditional transformer struggles with non-stationary data or what specific limitations arise when handling the non-stationary data outlined in this article. These points should be clearly delineated in Figure 1.\n\n\n[1] Kuznetsov, Vitaly, and Mehryar Mohri  \"Learning theory and algorithms for forecasting non-stationary time series.\" NIPS'2015.\n[2] Zhang, Shao-Qun, and Zhi-Hua Zhou. \"Harmonic recurrent process for time series forecasting.\" ECAI'2020."
