Thus, the work is well-motivated and has a potential for improving our understanding of this fundamental trade-off."

The authors claim that the introduced framework can be used to 1) assess estimator performance and 2) identify areas of improvement for image reconstruction techniques. Even though Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that the framework gives sensible results that correspond to what we would expect from the theorems (higher perceptual quality results in higher uncertainty and higher distortion), it is not clear to me how much we can gain from this. In particular, I believe if we simply plotted LPIPS vs PSNR on various datasets for these techniques, we would see the same trend. That being said, the key contribution of the framework could be answering questions such as \"How much can we improve the perceptual quality/distortion of this network based on our model of the trade-off?\". Authors mention this direction repeatedly in the paper, but there are no experiments or further discussion supporting this. For instance, can we determine where a certain reconstruction technique lies in the uncertainty-perception plane and use that to derive useful clues what type of imrpovement we can still expect from our estimator? I believe that focusing on answering these questions on practical reconstruction techniques would very significantly increase the significance of the paper.\n- The paper has multiple typos and there is a repeated sentence in Section 2, please check."

Leveraging information theory tools, the authors introduce an uncertainty-perception (UP) function that captures the minimal uncertainty for a given level of perceptual quality. They prove several valuable properties of this function, establishing its quasi-linearity and bounding behavior. By adopting Renyi divergence as the perceptual measure, they further derive analytical bounds confining the UP function, giving rise to an insightful uncertainty-perception plane. This geometric construction categorizes estimators into impossible, optimal and suboptimal regions. The analysis reveals a dependence on dimensionality, with the tradeoff becoming more severe for higher dimensions. Finally, the authors connect uncertainty to MSE distortion, offering a novel perspective on the classic distortion-perception tradeoff. Experiments on super-resolution methods validate the tradeoff in practice."

The (previously reported) distortion-perception tradeoff itself is an extension of the classical distortion-rate curve (or tradeoff) in signal reconstruction by considering the preservation of the signal PDF. It turns out that (surprisingly) better preservation of the PDF raises the distortion-rate curve. As perceptual quality is somehow related to PDF preservation, divergence between the PDFs of the original and reconstructed signal is called \"perceptual deviation\". The distortion-\"perception\" tradeoff is actually a distortion-divergence tradeoff.\n\nIn this work, the authors extend the distortion-perception tradeoff by changing the distortion term. As opposed to the expected value of a distance between original and reconstructed signals, the authors propose to measure distortion through the entropy of the reconstruction error. They propose to measure distortion through uncertainty (or variability) as opposed to distance. In this way they define the uncertainty function U(P), that depends on P (Perception = divergence between PDFs); as opposed to the (previosuly used) distortion function D(P). The authors prove the properties of the U(P) function and show that D(P)>= U(P)."

While the main concept (the joint consideration of both deviations 1 and 2) was introduced in a previous work, it is interesting to keep on pointing out the surprising relation between the two deviations and this (technically sound) work presents analytical properties of an information theoretic extension of the distortion concept in the distortion-perception framework."

This section should link the Blau&Michaeli definition with \"no-reference distance\" definitions based on the similarity between PDFs (e.g. citations to [32-34] and associated reasoning in [Blau & Michaeli 18]). \nHowever, note that this divergence concept is related to the usefulness of summary statistics to capture the nature of textures, as in [Portilla&Simoncelli IJCV 2000], in more recent style transfer algorithms based on difference of Gram matrices in VGG-like nets [Gatys et al. CVPR 2016]) or in state-of-the-art perceptual distortion metrics such as DISTS [Ding et al. IEEE PAMI 2020]. Also worth citing in that paragraph is the recent work relating perceptual distances and PDFs [Hepburn et al. ICLR 2022], which makes interesting points on the difference between individual distances between samples and averages over ensembles. In particular [Hepburn et al. ICLR 2022] shows that perceptual distances capture relevant information on the image PDF.\n\n* Please discuss if the proposed uncertainty-perception concept could be extended to rate-distortion?  R(U,P) similarly to R(D,P) in [Blau & Michaeli 19].\n\n* The experiments depend on estimations of entropy and divergence between PDFs from samples of 243 dimensions. These estimations are risky and prone to high bias. How many samples did you used? Have you checked other estimators appart from Kozachenko-Leonenko?. Ready-to-use alternatives include (1) an improved Kozachenko-Leonenko estimator [Marin-Franch & Foster IEEE PAMI 2013] available here https://github.com/imarinfr/klo , or (2) a Gaussianization-based algorithm which has proved to be better [Laparra et al. IEEE TNN 2011], see the comparisons in [Malo J. Math. Neurosci. 2020], or in [Laparra et al. 2023 https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03807], available here https://isp.uv.es/RBIG4IT.htm    https://github.com/IPL-UV/rbig\nI suggest to repeat Fig. 4 and 5 with other estimators to have stronger evidences of the trend.\n\n* Please include a visual example for several points of Fig. 4. At least in the appendix if it doesnt fit in the main text. Remember that beyond conceptual definitions of \"Perceptual quality\", in this regard, nothing substitutes visual inspection of representative examples.\nIn these examples please report the uncertainty (entropy of error) but also the MSE. \n\nMINOR ISSUES\n\n* Why in fig 5 we have less points than in fig. 4?\n\n* The third paragraph in page 2 has a repeated sentence \"Conformal methods...\"\n\n* Last sentence of the fourth paragraph of page 2 is confusing (particularly as \"perceptual quality\" as in Blau&Michaeli had not been defined). Currently it says \"While the above studies address both uncertainty and perception, none of them explicitly quantify\nuncertainty as a function of perceptual quality\"... Please clarify in which way the above studies talk about \"perception\" and how your work is different. Is it because this one uses the divergence definition?. Probably it will be easier to clarify this if the suggested paragraph on \"Perceptual Quality Quantification\" is added before this comment.\n\n* What is n in the exponent of Lemma 1? is it dimension d?\n\n* [Blau & Michaeli 18a] and [Blau & Michaeli 18b] are the same?"
