The main result is stated, a positioning of the work with respect to both theory and practice is clearly outlined, and open questions are discussed, in a succinct manner. Then, the bulk of the article revolves around the proof strategy used to arrive at the main theorem in the paper.\n\n* I think there are nice connections with recent work such as [1], which deal with methods to factorize the data distribution into a product of conditional probability distributions that are strongly log-concave. Ultimately, the goal is to discover ways of using the vanilla score matching to sample from simpler distributions whereby the noise injection that is typical for score-based generative models is not needed.\n\n* To the best of my understanding, the technical strategy used to prove the main result is correct, well developed and clearly exposed (in the main paper)\n\n[1] Florentin Guth and Etienne Lempereur and Joan Bruna and St\u00e9phane Mallat, Conditionally Strongly Log-Concave Generative Models, ICML 2023"

                "value": "* I think there is some room for improvement in the overall narrative and exposition of the paper (there are a few typos, easy to fix and not problematic for the technical understanding).\nFirst of all, the assumption that the score is easy to compute and, in particular for some data distributions it can be analytically available, should be emphasized more. Essentially, this work side-steps the problems of learning the score function alltogether: despite citing the seminal work from Hyvarinen 2005, the authors chose not to bring to the readers' attention the fact that in practical cases, even the vanilla score can be hard to compute, as it can require costly computations of the trace of the Hessian of the parametric score, which derives from a rewrite of the Fisher divergence. So, I think it is important to mention that the parametric score function does not come for free in general settings.\n\n* The main results in the paper requires very important ``ingredients'':\n1. An early stop mechanism, to set the Langevin Monte Carlo process evolution to stop at a very well defined diffusion time. There is no discussion about the practical implications of the tight bound on $T$ derived in Theorem 1, which is exponential in the data complexity (in the case of the paper, this takes the form of the number of mixture components $K$)\n\n2. The tight bound on step size for the simulation of discrete-time Langevin dynamics decreases exponentially with the data complexity. Although this is not surprising, the more complex the data, the finer-grained your simulation should be, I think a discussion on practical implications is in order.\n\n3. The quality of the approximation of the parametric score function is an assumption that is, in my opinion, very strong, and hardly achievable in practice. This is not a problem in the ``simple'' setting of this work, where data is assumed to be a mixture of $K$ log-concave, smooth components, which is needed to come up with a feasible proof strategy. However, in reality, parametric score functions can only approximate the true score.\n\n4. The number $M$ of i.i.d. samples required to define the initial condition of the discrete Langevin process is not discussed appropriately. From Theorem 1, it seems to me that we need a fairly large number of samples, but I must confess I had a hard time finding the impact of $M$ on the proof strategy outlined in Section 2 of the paper. \n\n* Experiments are weak. Of course we are not talking about using the typical datasets that the current literature on score-based generative modeling. As an example, the results displayed in Figure 2 could have been commented more in the optic of explaining the relation to the above 4 points. Some hints are available in Appendix I, such as details on the learning procedure for the vanilla score network, but I still find it hard to relate such technical details to the hypothesis required for Theorem 1 to be valid.\n\n* [minor weakness] The editorial format of the paper is somehow unconventional. There is no conclusion, and a large fraction of the real-estate available on the 9 pages is dedicated to material that often is given a prime spot in the appendix. If on the one hand I like this presentation style, as it is really helpful to go through the proof strategy detail, the downside is that it substract space to provide more insights on experiments, outline conclusion and compare to prior (albeit experimental) work upon which the authors have drawn inspiration."

These assumptions might not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the practical applicability of the results. Could the author please elaborate on that? \n- The method relies on various parameters such as $\\delta$ (overlap parameter), $H$ (tuning parameter), $\\epsilon$ (error threshold), and step size $h$. How can one justify the generalization of the method across different datasets or scenarios due to the fact that sensitivity to these parameters could make the approach highly sensitive to the choice of initial conditions and hyperparameters, making it challenging? \n- As mentioned earlier,  the analysis focuses on an idealized scenario and might not directly translate to real-world applications. The conditions and assumptions required for the analysis might be too strict or unrealistic for practical use cases, limiting the method's applicability in real-world data analysis or machine learning tasks. How does this work can be applied in practice? How does it apply to high-dimensional data? Experimental results with high-dimensional data are required to show the efficacy of the procedure. \n- The analysis briefly touches upon the scenario where the score function is estimated from data. In practice, obtaining a precise score function estimation can be a challenging task and might introduce significant errors in the analysis.\n- The passage does not provide a comprehensive comparison with existing methods or techniques in the field. Without a clear comparison, it's challenging to assess the novelty and superiority of the proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art methods for similar tasks.

Some remarks can also feel a little unconvincing there. For example, computational hardness arguments are invoked in the motivation but the main idea of noised score learning is to have an annealing scheme where the denoising is only performed from one noise level to a slightly lower noise level. Annealing breaks down the difficulty of denoising, so the paragraph is criticizing an alternative that is never used. A further minor point: remark 5 is an excessively long paragraph to say the mean is not in the typical set in high dimensions.\n- *Log sobolev constant for well connected mixtures* : A contribution of the paper is extending the Poincare inequality through decompositions result of Madras & Randall (2002) to the log sobolev inequality. It would be very surprising if such an extension has not already been done as the result is old and functional inequalities are heavily researched. I would kindly ask the authors to check and possibly include references [1] to ensure that they are not missing prior work.\n- *On significance*: For the MCMC community this result will not be worthwhile as samples aren't available. For generative modeling where there is a dataset, the better modelling of what practitioners do uses time-varying score functions and so what is done in practice does not correspond to Langevin with a time independent score. The \"long line\" of experimental work that uses vanilla langevin is claimed to exist but never cited. The paper answers a small interesting curiosity related to data based initialization for sampling from mixtures with limited links with practice.\n---\n[1] Jerrum, M., Son, J.

Some minor issues in writing:\n* Page 1, first bullet point of positive aspects: \u201ca simple closed form solution <when> the class of models\u201d\n* Page 3, the line above **Theorem 1**: \u201csamplling\u201d\n* Page 3, strange expression: \u201cNote in particular that we have can draw as many samples as we like\u201d. Perhaps remove \u201chave\u201d?"
