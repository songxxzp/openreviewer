Therefore, this paper proposes ReweightOOD, a weight mapping function based on similarity, to prioritize hard positives and hard negatives.

The article introduces what contrastive learning is and discusses the challenges encountered by classical contrastive learning in tackling OOD problems. The authors believe that the main issue with contrastive learning in addressing OOD problems is that the discrimination between many difficult samples is not high enough, resulting in a close proximity among these challenging samples. As a result, it becomes difficult to recognize OOD samples. Therefore, the authors propose a reweighting approach to enhance the discrimination between different categories in contrastive learning, thereby improving the effectiveness of OOD detection."

However, this improvement is mainly due to the low performance of the baseline method itself. The proposed method does not actually achieve such a significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). In my opinion, this exaggerates the contribution of this paper. It would be better to clarify the improvement relative to SOTA in the beginning to avoid misleading the readers.\n\n2. The simplicity of the method itself can be considered an advantage. However, based on the experimental results, the improvement of this paper compared to the state-of-the-art is limited. Therefore, I hope the authors can further explore this direction and achieve more substantial advancements.\n\n3. The experiments conducted in this paper are not comprehensive enough.

In particular, these are very strong baselines and I see the performance of this method at the same level as ReAct. It is a bit strange that the evaluation does not involve any activation-clipping baselines such as ReAct and ASH (they are clear state-of-the-art methods and do not require any training). \n\n\n>[1] React: Out-of-distribution detection with rectified activations.

Usually, people evaluate OOD methods on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-1k benchmarks. I would be convinced if the method also works for ImageNet-1k. \n\n3. **The instance weight can be replaced with learnable temperatures.**  Adding weight significance to the samples is one way to obtain a higher inter-class separation, but I am wondering if would it also make sense to make the temperature learnable. Compared with weight significance, it would bring another benefit: learnable distribution shaping for each category.  \n\n4. **How does the method perform when scaling to more/fewer categories?** I would suspect the performance is highly related to the number of categories. If the value is too large (e.g., 1000) or too small (e.g., 5), the performance might deteriorate. Can authors provide some ablation studies on subsets of the used datasets?\n\n5. **Does the method also work for Transformer-based architectures?** Currently the authors evaluate their approach with ResNet-18, DenseNet and WideResNet? Can authors do more experimental evaluation on Transformers?"

E,g [1][2]. I think the novelty is sort of limited as the paper adopt hard sample mining/weighting into OOD detection task. In rebuttal, can you explain the difference bewteen your work and [1,2] in terms of hard samples re-weighting?\n\nExperiment:\n- In ImageNet100, can we have numbers from other methods (e.g, CIDER) instead of SupCon only.\n- For Table 1,2, I am interested to see how the MES score and Average centroid dispersion for CIDER. \n- Hyperparameters test on linear transformation are encouraged. It is said that ResNet18 network are set to (5, \u22122, 2, 1) and (5, \u22124, 2, 1). Do you have to set differently for other backbones or datasets?\n- For Figure 5 (b), why there is only one cluster? also, can you provide feature vislization for SupCon or CIDER as well?\n\n[1] CurricularFace: Adaptive Curriculum Learning Loss for Deep Face Recognition\n[2] AdaFace: Quality Adaptive Margin for Face Recognition"
