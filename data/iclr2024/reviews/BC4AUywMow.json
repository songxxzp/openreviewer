                "value": "My central and huge concern is about the utility of such a pipeline: it inputs a mesh, outputs its SDF. This function (computing an SDF) can quickly be performed without any learning based technique, using standard geometric computing librairies like IGL or trimesh.\nAll the information is already present in the mesh! Why use a network to learn it?\nOverall, using a neural network for this introduces computational overhead (the network needs to be trained), complexity, un-explainability, approximations, and has no clear motivation. \n\nFrom this stems another weakness: the comparison with other baselines is unfair, since Convoccnet, IFNet and ONet take pointclouds as inputs, not meshes. In other words, they reconstruct a surface from an incomplete input, while the proposed pipeline has access to a full mesh.\n\nIf the method was about robustly getting an SDF out of a poorly triangulated mesh, then the whole paper needs to be rewritten with this target in mind. This means that the introduction should clearly set this goal, and the experiment sections needs to be reworked in order to include experiments on broken meshes with different defects, on which standard libraries fail.\n\nAlternatively, if the method is about a novel mesh encoder network, then the task and decoder need to be changed to something else than regressing an SDF - part segmentation, classification\u2026.\n\nFinally, if the point is about demonstrating that an SDF can be learned without explicit supervision, only by solving the Eikonal equation: this has already been demonstrated in SAL and SAL++ (Atzmon et al., these references are missing). For the cases shown in this submission, this is a made up problem, since ground truth SDF values can easily be computed, and are even used in the network evaluation. In other words, this does not enable new applications."

Using this design, it primarily addresses the task of 3D shape reconstruction from meshes. \nThe major technical contribution is the \"hybrid\" encoder architecture. Given a mesh, the method uses (1) a graph convolutional encoder to extract per-vertex features; (2) a multi-resolution grid structure to accumulate features from the vertices on grid nodes.\nThe authors also leverages the Eikonal loss to learn the neural signed distance field, obviating the need for pre-computing the SDF values in the training data. Although this is also claimed as a major contribution, it has been widely used in the neural shape modeling literature as of 2023.\nExperiments have validated some of the design choices (such as the interpolation scheme when aggregating the grid features), and have compared to a few recent baselines. In general, the proposed method does show superior performance in terms of local geometric details. However, quantitative results do not consistently surpass certain baselines and some more recent work should have been considered as baselines."

On the airplane examples (as in the supplementary video), the model also shoes good performance reconstructing thin and (pontentially non-manifold) structures such as the fin and wings."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- Motivation: First of all, I'm wondering what's the practical application of the proposed method. The method assumes a mesh as input and aims to reconstruct a signed distance function from it, which also represents the geometry. If we already have the geometry well represented by a mesh, why is it necessary to reconstruct an SDF from it at a cost of losing certain surface details? On the other hand, given a mesh, one can directly compute the (signed) distance function by computing the distance from the query point to the surface. What's the benefit of introducing a neural network?\n\n- Technical technical contribution: \n   - The Eikonal loss is considered as a major technical novelty, but it has been proposed for learning 3D shapes in (Gropp et al. 2020) \n \"Implicit Geometric Regularization for Learning Shapes (IGR)\", and widely adopted for rendering implicit geometry (e.g. NeuS [Wang et al. NeurIPS 2021], VolSDF [Yariv et al. NeurIPS 2021]) and other downstream tasks such modeling deformable shapes (e.g. SCANimate [Saito et al. 2021]). This hurts a major technical contribution of this paper. At least the IGR paper by Gropp et al. should be cited and discussed. \n   - While the hybrid encoder is interesting, the whole pipeline is more of a straightforward combination of standard modules (as of 2023) such as the graph convolution encoder, the multi-resolution features (as in IF-Net and NGLOD), and Siren decoder (as in the SIREN paper by Sitzmann et al). While admittedly this shouldn't be a major weakness per se, it is crucial to have more thorough ablation experiments to validate the intuitive combination. Most importantly, the graph conv + grid conv encoder is the key contribution. What would happen if the graph conv is shut down and one only uses the traditional point-encoder by densely sampling points from the input mesh surface? What if one doesn't use grid projection+interpolation at all, and simply uses the interpolated feature at the query point's nearest point on the mesh surface? To me, such experiments are critical in validating the technical contributions, but are missing. \n\n- Experiments. \n   - First of all, all baseline methods are from 2020 and do not represent the state-of-the-art performance. For example, POCO (Boulch et al., CVPR 2022) can be considered as a stronger baseline model for reconstructing shapes. \n   - In terms of model performance, the proposed method has significantly higher \"relative error\" than IFNet on all datasets and there lacks a sound explanation supported by experiments. Again, given a mesh, computing the *accurate* SDF is straightforward, but from table 1, the proposed method cannot reproduce this property, which thus undermines its potential in the applications.\n   - (minor) Table 2 only reports numbers on the Dragons and states 'results on other datasets are similar' -- I'd recommend showing all the results to make this statement more convincing."

Does this yield a better performance than the original version of these models using their own decoder?\n- In page 5, paragraph below Eq. 2 states that the last two terms in Eq. 2 are redundant but can improve training. Is there experimental results that support this argument?"
