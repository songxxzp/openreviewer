An extensive study on tweaking the\nfundamental but seemingly trivial hyper-parameters, such as the number of iterations, step size, and momentum coefficient, is also carried out.

[Clarity]:\n\u2022 Detailed experiment settings and algorithm descriptions are provided in the Appendix.\n\u2022 At the end of each subsection of an empirical study, there\u2019s a \u201cTakeaways\u201d section that summarizes the authors\u2019 observations and insights.\n\u2022 At the end of each subsection of a proposed trick, there\u2019s a \u201cResults\u201d section that analyzes the attack success rate (ASR) results, concludes the functionality and mechanism of the specific trick, and validates the author\u2019s hypothesis if there\u2019s one.

Particularly, comparing their approach to the runner-up method, there\u2019s a remarkable 18.1% improvement against the most powerful defense method \u2013 Random Smoothing (RS).
