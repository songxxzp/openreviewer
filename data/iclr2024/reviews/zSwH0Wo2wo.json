                "value": "(Novelty) There exists a sort of study that tried to build the red team dataset and a classifier based on the human-in-the-loop framework [1,2,3]. These methods utilize human resources to generate adversarial prompts and label the harmfulness of the model response to construct a dataset and train a classifier. If I understood correctly, the main difference between existing studies can be written as following:\n1. For the \"Attack\" part, the proposed \"from scratch\" framework utilized a rl-based attack algorithm instead of human attackers as in [1,2]. However, as stated in the paper, the rl-based attack algorithm has been used in prior works such as [Deng et al., 2022] or [Perez et al., 2022b].\n2. The authors utilize diversity sampling to avoid mode collapses of the rl-based attack method. However, [Perez et al., 2022b] already emphasize the importance of diversity in red-teaming. Moreover, the other study proposed a red teaming approach that incorporates the diversity of adversarial prompts into the objective function throughout the red teaming process [4]. \n\nCan you clarify the novelty of the proposed \"from scratch\" red teaming method in detail?\n\n(Quantitative Analysis) The paper provides a few quantitative analyses. Most of the experimental results are qualitative. The examples in Appendix B about mode collapse seems clear, but it would be more credible if you could provide quantitative red-teaming results with and without each diversity sampling in step 1 and 3 with appropriate diversity metric and performance metric.\n\n(Limited Scenarios) I cannot agree with the justification of the scenarios. My questions can be divided into the following two parts:\n1. In the paper, the authors state that \"Most importantly, if failures can already be efficiently identified in advance, then red-teaming has limited value because bad text could simply be filtered from the model\u2019s training data and/or outputs.\" However, filtering in training data or outputs can degrade the model performance. Model unlearning can be another solution to this problem, but it doesn't work well in my knowledge. Can you provide any references to your statement? \n2. Once we made datasets and classifiers for some purposes like toxicity or fact-checking, we can re-use these again and again to red-team the different LMs. If you already have data and classifiers, it seems strange not to utilize them. Therefore, the situation, in which the proposed scenario is valid, is limited to cases where the target criteria of harmfulness are significantly different from the existing collected data, so the existing data cannot be utilized. I can't agree on whether there will be many cases like this, can you explain more? Or can you provide quantitative evidence that the proposed method is effective when there is a lot of data already collected and the classifier is learned?\n\n(Missing References)\n- [1] Build it Break it Fix it for Dialogue Safety: Robustness from Adversarial Human Attack, Dinan et al., 2019.\n- [2] Bot-Adversarial Dialogue for Safe Conversational Agents, Xu et al., 2021.\n- [3] SQuARe: A Large-Scale Dataset of Sensitive Questions and Acceptable Responses Created Through Human-Machine Collaboration, Lee et al., ACL 2023.\n- [4] Query-Efficient Black-Box Red Teaming via Bayesian Optimization, Lee et al., ACL 2023."

The purpose of this method is to enable red-teaming of LLMs in cases where there is no pre-existing understanding of what kinds of outputs would be considered \u201cbad\u201d for the model. In the first step, the method samples prompts and outputs as an exploratory stage. Then, using humans in the loop, examples from the previous stage are labeled and a model and task specific classifier is trained with a label set defined based on the types of outputs seen in the explore stage. Finally, the exploit stage uses reinforcement learning and the output classifier to train an LLM capable of generating adversarial prompts for the LLM being red-teamed. In two experimental settings, the paper shows results that suggest the method does allow for improved generation of prompts that elicit forbidden outputs. The paper also introduces a dataset, CommonClaims, that contains statements that are labeled as common-knowledge-true, common-knowledge-false, or neither."

This is only a mild weakness of the work, however, because the paper is mostly about introducing the new method. The second weakness is just that I would have liked to see more discussion of the limitations of the approach at a high-level. For example, are there alternatives to using an LLM to generate adversarial prompts? What kinds of biases might this introduce? How scalable is the method when the second step requires human input? The lack of discussion of these questions is not a major issue, but it would be nice in a future version to see the limitations section fleshed out a bit more."
