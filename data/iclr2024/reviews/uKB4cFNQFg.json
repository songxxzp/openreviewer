The training data seems to mainly be human curated biological data sets. Is this correct? Although it should not be considered an important critique of the submission, I strongly believe that the future of computational biology will be analysis of more complex data sets having a more complete signal. That is, the annotated data is often not sufficient, and richer experimental datasets will facilitate more interesting analyses. The underlying reason is that the biological reality is more complex: there may be multiple start sites, etc. Nevertheless, the described models can certainly serve as a step in this direction\n\nHowever, the paper contains quite a lot of background and it is a benchmarking study of several methods that only available as rxiv papers, according to the references. The call for papers does not spell out how focused the conference is on original research, which makes the fit of the paper  somewhat unclear. I would, however, not priorities this paper in a comparison with the average ICLR paper."

I expect such a model to perform much better than the DNA LM approach.\n\n- Regarding the enhancer prediction task:  This is a case where additional forms of data such as DNA accessibility and DNA contacts are able to provide additional hints that make this problem more tractable, and likely provide much higher accuracy than reported here (see e.g. the EPCOT model from the Liu lab).\n\n- The gene-finding task is somewhat contrived, as the resulting prediction need post-processing is required to convert those predictions into a coherent gene model.

It should be noted in the manuscript that those numbers should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n- The authors note that \"reasoning over very long contexts, as e.g. required for finding enhancers, is still challenging.\"  Is this too much to expect from these models?  (i.e expect them to reason over long sequence contexts). Perhaps we should be content with LMs producing representations that are based on short contexts, and leave long-range contexts for downstream models?\n\n- The authors say the provide \"An adaptable benchmarking framework for preparing embeddings and training lightweight supervised models.\"  This point requires some elaboration - I assume you are referring to the code in the (currently anonymous) github repository.\n\n- You had noted that your benchmark's advantage is a mix of short and long sequence classification; however, I think you could have chosen better problems for long sequence tasks, e.g. gene expression prediction; also, the histone modification prediction task might have benefitted from longer sequence contexts.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- A comment regarding splice site classification:  You note that \"Moreover, there are cases in which a short-sequence task represents a simplification compared to real-world applications, as exemplified by SS-containing sequences. In genome annotation, classifying SSs is a subproblem of the gene finding task and would typically not be performed on its own.\"  This is mixing the issue of short sequences and how a splice site classifier would be used.  From my experience, SS classification is a relatively easy task that does not really need long sequences; while it is used in gene finding, it has other applications related to gene annotation; the condition-dependent version of the problem stands on its own (see e.g. the recent paper on the pangolin deep learning model).  \n\n- \"The availability of unlabeled genomic sequences and limited labeled data appear to make language modeling a natural fit for DNA.\"\nThere is actually a wealth of labeled data - models like Sei and Enformer are very successful at leveraging large scale labeled data.\n\n- \"Gene-adjacent regulatory elements are referred to as cis, and distant ones as trans.\"  The definition of cis and trans is not a matter of distance!\n\n- Reference missing in 3.3:  and follows the methodology of ??."

It seems weird to refer to this as detecting \"long-range interactions,\" since the task does not require that a given enhancer actually be operating on the gene at the center of the selected window.  I also don't understand in what sense this annotation framing of the problem can be considered \"more stringent.\"\n\nWhy did you choose not to do fine-tuning for each task?

If the authors address the concerns raised in my comments, I would be inclined to recommend a higher score for this submission. \n\n- Figure 1 appears to inaccurately represent the length of certain genomic features. For example, the majority of exons in the human genome are shorter than 200 base pairs, with an average length between $120-170$ base pairs. Furthermore, promoter lengths usually range from 100 to 1000 base pairs. The diagram should at least offer a rough indication of these lengths. It's also crucial to highlight that exons and introns alternate in their appearance, a detail that the figure should encompass.\n- In the introduction, l'd suggest mentioning foundational works like DeepSEA alongside DeepBind when discussing supervised learning on DNA. These groundbreaking studies have left an indelible mark on the field.\n- Concerning the enhancer annotation, there is some uncertainty regarding the authenticity of the ground truth. The ABC method is based on inference and might not reflect a direct experimental outcome.\n- Clarity is sought on the dataset splitting methodology - why was the data from the pretraining phase included? What about considering a leave-chromosome-out approach to splitting? The methods to prevent data leakage should also be elucidated.\n- The decision to categorize variant effect prediction as a binary problem raises questions. Given the intricate nature of genomic variations and the subsequent implications, framing this as a regression task might be more appropriate.\n- It's crucial, especially with such intricate datasets, that downstream models be evaluated using a leave-chromosome-out strategy to guarantee robust results.\n- Te absence of a simple CNN baseline for the variant effect prediction task is a notable omission. Such a baseline would not only validate the implemented supervised models but also provide an insight into the relative performance of more complex models."
