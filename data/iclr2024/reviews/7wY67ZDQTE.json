                "value": "There are a few aspects of the work that prevent me from recommending publication at this stage. I look forward to reading the authors replies to my concerns, upon which I may improve my score.\n* In Remark 3, the authors clearly state that a kernel width of $\\sigma=0$ reduces the CS divergence between the true posterior and the decoder distribution to classical MSE. With this in light, it is not clear in what respect CS divergence is fundamentally different from estimating $I(y;t)$ using a Gaussian variational distribution (limits novelty). Also, it is not clear why the CS-IB outperforms other methods also for $r=0$.\n* In Remark 4, the authors claim that the use of KL divergence combined with a Gaussian assumption is \"likely to induce inductive bias\". The same can be said about using CS divergence with Gaussian kernels (which resonates with Remark 3, for which CS divergence reduces to MSE for $\\sigma=0$). Specifically, at a very superficial glance it appears that the inductive biases of KL+Gauss and CS+Gauss are not too different. I would appreciate a paragraph explaining the fundamental differences (from the perspective of inductive bias).\n* While I agree that CS-QMI is a rigorous definition, I do not agree that the proposed estimator measures mutual dependence in bits. As has been known for some time (see, e.g., Th. 1 in Amjad and Geiger or the work of Goldfeld et al.), for deterministic networks true MI between $x$ and $t$ is infinite. I doubt that $D_{CS}$ remains finite in such a setting (e.g., Renyi divergence is infinite if the joint and product of marginal distributions are singular w.r.t. each other, cf. Th. 24 in van Erven and Harremoes). From that perspective, I do not see how your estimators based on CS divergence have substantial mathematical advantages over existing estimators (although I acknowledge that the estimation may still be useful from a practical perspective; also, I understand that your networks are stochastic, because $t$ is obtained by adding Gaussian noise to a decoder output).\n* One of my main concerns is the comparison of methods in Table 2 and Fig. 2. As far as I can see, $r$ is defined via the respective estimators (i.e., CS divergences for CS-IB, variational costs for VIB, etc.). This makes a comparison difficult, as the same $r$ indeed may lead to different compression ratios when compression is measured in a common currency (e.g., CS divergence for all methods). While this is problematic only for Table 2, in Fig. 2 the same holds for $I(y,t)$. Specifically, CS-IB is the only method that does not use the MSE, for the estimation of $I(y;t)$ which explains the difference at $r=0$. Essentially, the red line may be just above all others because $I(y;t)$ is measured differently (namely, using CS divergence). Also here a common currency would be better, such as MSE or RMSE. (Further, using the RMSE would allow for a better comparison with Table 2.)\n\n_EDIT:_ Improved my score after rebuttal phase."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I would like to express my sincere respect for all the efforts the authors have invested in this paper. Unfortunately, however, I cannot strongly recommend this paper as an ICLR 2024 accepted paper for the following reasons: (1) a misalignment between the claims of contribution, the assumptions of theoretical analysis, and the content of theoretical analysis; (2) a lack of theoretical guarantees on the properties of the proposed estimations, and the unclear discussion of the pros and cons between direct estimation and upper bound estimation approaches, or the absence of sufficient comparative experiments to complement it; and (3) concerns regarding the reliability of the experimental results. The details are provided below. If there are any misunderstandings, I apologize, and I would appreciate it if you could explain them to me.\n\n## A misalignment between the claims of contribution, the assumptions of theoretical analysis, and the content of theoretical analysis\n- The authors claim that by leveraging the CS divergence, they can perform non-linear IB regression for any distribution $p(x, y)$ without heavy reliance on variational approximations and without making distribution assumptions. How accurate is this claim? The independence from the variational distribution seems to be achieved not so much due to the properties of the CS divergence but rather through non-parametric estimation using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) on the outputs from neural networks, treating them as samples from the training data. Therefore, the motivation for introducing the CS divergence may lack a clear and solid rationale, leaving room for discussion regarding its validity in the context of this presentation.\n- Furthermore, while the authors claim that their contribution lies in the ability to estimate without making distribution assumptions, the actual theoretical analysis deals with a limited setting where both the model distribution and variational distribution are assumed to be normal distributions. This limitation is acknowledged as a one of limitations in Appendix D. However, it can be considered a significant weakness that the proposed method's theoretical guarantees are limited, given the broad claim of removing the necessity of distribution assumptions. This disparity should ideally be addressed in the main part of the paper.\n- For one of the contributions mentioned, I believe the explanation of the adversarial robustness aspect is rather too concise. Besides Lemma 1, there should be a proper proof for [Wang et al., 2021] Theorem 2's Corollary as well. In the current presentation, while one may vaguely understand the content being discussed, the explanations are too informal, making it difficult to accurately determine whether the validity is established. The theoretical part of the proof should ideally be self-contained within the main paper, rather than relying on related literature.\n- The assumptions underlying generalization analysis and adversarial robustness have not been well-organized. It is recommended to consolidate these assumptions.\n\n## A lack of theoretical guarantees on the properties of the proposed estimations, and the unclear discussion of the pros and cons between direct estimation and upper bound estimation approaches, or the absence of sufficient comparative experiments to complement it\n- When constructing nonparametric estimators, a critical concern always revolves around whether (asymptotic) unbiasedness or (asymptotic) consistency is guaranteed. This theoretical assurance holds true for nonparametric estimations like Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) based on KL divergence [1,2], among others. In the context of the IB method under focus here, I presume that unbiasedness and consistency play a significant role in determining its performance. The importance of analyzing this aspect lies in the bias introduced by parameter estimation in variational approaches dependent on the variational distribution, as well as the bias in the estimators of the proposed method. Deciding which of these biases is smaller - the one induced by parameter estimation or the one introduced by the proposed method - is a crucial perspective in determining whether a direct estimation approach, like the proposed method, or a variational estimation approach is more useful. Unfortunately, this paper lacks comprehensive discussions on this aspect. The lack of convincing arguments on why a direct estimation approach like the proposed method is effective. This issue holds immense significance in the comparison between the proposed method and conventional methods, and it remains one of the unresolved problems in this paper, marked as a limitation. Relevant questions pertaining to this matter are summarized in the Question section.\n- When comparing the bias introduced by the variational approach with that introduced by nonparametric estimations such as the proposed method, it would be beneficial to investigate a toy example with an increased sample size to determine which approach exhibits higher estimation accuracy. Unfortunately, this paper did not provide such experimental confirmations.\n- The authors, I believe, are understood, but the theory in Section 3.2.1 assumes that the generalization error upper bound is derived in a manner that includes the objective function of the proposed method, which alone does not guarantee generalization performance, as is evident. As mentioned in the Strength section, the attempt to experimentally verify this aspect is a fascinating endeavor. However, the empirical correlations have only been validated on toy data. To increase the persuasiveness of the empirical evidence regarding the correlation with generalization performance, it would have been necessary to confirm the experimental results on benchmark data adopted in Section 4.\n\n## Concerns regarding the reliability of the experimental results.\n- Due to the absence of reports on measures of dispersion, such as standard deviations, for all the experimental results in this paper, it is difficult to determine whether the proposed method consistently achieves superior performance compared to other methods. This raises concerns about the validity of the claim made by the authors as one of their contributions, that CS-IB outperforms other methods. Since the proposed method is built on nonparametric estimation, it is conceivable that the variance of the estimates can become large when there are not enough samples, leading to increased variability in performance. In essence, to support the claim that the proposed method is superior, it would be challenging to agree without considering factors such as the randomness of model initialization, mini-batch datasets, and adversarial perturbations. It is advisable to repeat the experiments several times, report the average and standard error of the obtained prediction accuracy, and evaluate performance while taking variability into account.\n- I find it puzzling that some of the reported numerical values in the experiments are identical in every aspect. For instance, in Table 2, the RMSE for the existing methods when $r=0$ is a complete match across all experimental settings. This further emphasizes the need for reporting both the average prediction accuracy and the standard error. While the average prediction accuracy may be the same, the standard error might differ between methods. If they do indeed match perfectly, it is advisable to check for any implementation bugs. At the very least, there are concerns regarding the credibility of the currently reported numerical values.\n- I apologize if I missed any details earlier, but it does appear that there is a lack of explanation regarding hyperparameter settings, such as in Table 4. This omission can give the impression that there might be arbitrariness in the experimental results. If you have indeed eliminated arbitrariness, it would be beneficial to provide more detailed explanations about how you selected the reported hyperparameters. This would help enhance the transparency and credibility of your findings."

I would appreciate your responses.\n\n- It seems that this nonparametric approach could also be applicable to the conventional objective function based on KL divergence. Why was it not discussed, proposed, or included as a subject for comparative experiments?\n- As mentioned in Remark 1, CS divergence is a special case of R\u00e9nyi divergence. Under this premise, it could have been considered as a generalization of the conventional KL-based methods using R\u00e9nyi divergence, especially from the perspective that it converges to KL divergence as \u03b1 approaches. Why was the emphasis placed on this particular special case?\n- The uniqueness of the KDE estimator in CS divergence has already been provided by [3]. I understand the need to construct an estimator consisting of three elements: predictions, input data, and label data, in the context of the IB method. However, it seems that there might not be such a fundamental difference between the basic nonparametric estimation and the proposed method. If these aspects are positioned as variations based on the ideas from related research, it would be beneficial to explicitly state this and discuss the differences, if any. What are your thoughts on this?\n- Can you guarantee the asymptotic properties of the two estimation methods in the proposed approach? For instance, is asymptotic unbiasedness or consistency ensured?\n- Why do the performance values for existing methods in Table 2 match perfectly? \n- Why was it not considered to conduct repeated experiments and report the mean and standard deviation?\n- How were the hyperparameters selected?\n\n## Citation\n(Note: I am not the author of the following papers)\n\n[1]: Q.
