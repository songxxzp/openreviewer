The authors provide an extension to the frequency domain termed as GDM-F. The work claims that a notable characteristic of GDM is that the latent space now possesses group-wise interpretable meaning, for instance to attribute changes in features of an image."

                "value": "---Specific comments---\n\n-Shouldn't the title be \"Sequential Data Generation with Group-wise Diffusion Processes\" or \"Sequential Data Generation with a Group-wise Diffusion Process\"? \n\n-After Eq. (1): It appears a variable \"$a$\" instead of \"$\\alpha$\", $a(0)=1$ and $a(1)\\approx 0\t$, is it a typo? Or what is $a$?\n\n-Before Eq. (2): correct singular or plural in \"some recent work instead use the linear interpolation\", \"...recent work uses the linear\" or \"...recent works use\"?\n\n-In Eq. (3): the variable $\\boldsymbol{x_{\\theta}}$ was not introduced. Also, what is $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ in the minimization argument? It was not introduced.\n\n-Before Eq. (4): There is a double notation for the variable $\\boldsymbol{v_{\\theta}}$ or $\\mathbf{v_{\\theta}}$, or are they different?\n\n-Include a comma \",\" after Eq. (2) and Eq. (3).\n\n-Section 3.1: I believe the first paragraph should be rewritten in a more detailed way. This paragraph is key to lead the reader to understand the way data division in performed. For instance, it is not clear \"we divide\ndata into $1 \\leq k \\leq d$ groups\", does this mean we divide the data into any possible integer in the interval $1 \\leq k \\leq d$, then that integer value represents the number of groups? Or is it that you want to divide data into a number of $d$ groups, where each group has a length of $k$? Shouldn't we refer to the total number of data and then refer to the splits of that number as per your method proposes? \n\n-Also Section 3.1: It suddenly appears \"we divide the indices $\\{1, ..., d\\}$ into a partition $\\{S j \\}^k_{j=1}$\". Do you divide the set $\\{1, ..., d\\}$ into another set $\\{S_1,S_2...,S_k\\}$? So, what is the meaning or definition of each $S_i$?\nThat is not clear to me.\n\n-At the end of Section 3.1: It reads \"the elements of j-th latent group are diffused into noise\", what is a latent group? When was the name latent group introduced? Or what variable corresponds to such a latent group?\n\n-Before Eq. (8): It reads \"Instead, we find that it is beneficial to define $\\mathbf{u_{\\theta}}$\", why is it beneficial? It is important to include the explanation in the phrase to guide the reader.\n\n-There is no consistence with the figures when they are cited in the text and when they appear. See for instance Fig. 5 and Fig. 4.\n\n-In the experiments section: It might be quite important to be able to interconnect what it was derived in the methodology with the experiments. For instance where it reads \"Fig. 6 shows that manipulating a single element in the latent vector of the lowest\nfrequency band results in a change in a single high-level attribute of images.\", where is that latent vector appearing in the methodology, what Equation? how can the reader understand from the methodology where the variable that seems quite important is appearing. What is the dimensionality of such a variable?\n\n-Introduce the acronym FID!\n\n-Include comma \",\" after Eq. (2) and (3).\n\n-Period \".\" after Eq. (8).\n\n---Other Questions---\n\n-In the Fig. 6 where traversing a single latent variable is associated to a particular featured changed in the images, what is the effect of traversing other elements like (2), (3), (10) or (20)?\n\n-In the practice, in which scenarios should we apply GDM or GDM-F?"
