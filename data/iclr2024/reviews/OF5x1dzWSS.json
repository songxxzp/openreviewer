The authors use a doubly robust optimization (DRO) approach that is theoretically grounded. It provides a principled way to reweight the training examples based on their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. \n\n2. Even the algorithm falls under the category of iteratively-reweighted adversarial attack, this paper has a more principled optimization formulation than previous works because its DRO approach combines two different models to estimate the importance weights of each training example, and to estimate the importance weights, which is more robust to model misspecification and can handle a wider range of distributional shifts compared to traditional optimization methods. The obtained weights are optimal for the DRO optimization problem defined in Eq. 5 (with the closed-form exact solution for the weights), rather than being ad-hoc picked. This is the most important difference form previous instance-wise or iterative attacks.\n\n3. The bilevel optimization formulation of AT gives one the flexibility to separately design the inner and outer level objectives. This enables the authors to independently construct a new outer level objective that also solves for the instance weights w, and an inner level objective for regularized attack. This flexibility allows for a more generic and powerful framework than the traditional AT formulation, which is limited to a single objective function.\n\n4. The proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on standard classification datasets, in terms of robustness against multiple adversarial attacks. They also show that their method can improve the robustness of the weakest (worst-case) data points, which is an important property for real-world applications."

Adding some more comparison method would be good."

Consequently, the authors follow the setting of Zhang et al. 2022  (bilevel optimization formulation for AT) and add the instance reweighting mechanism into it. Moreover, the authors seek to  build a model in the outer level problem that is robust not only to the adversarial examples but also to the worst-case attack distribution.  Compared with the exisiting instance reweighting AT methods, the proposed method  obtain the importance weights by distributionally robust optimization (DRO). The DRO is a more sophisticated choice than the heuristic/geometric schemes of instance rewweighting. Furthermore, the authors propose an equivalent compositional optimization problem (Eq. (6)) and adopt the log-barrier penalty function to drop the challenging $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm constraint. The final optimization problem is Eq. (7) and the authors modify SCGD into the compositional implicit differentiation (CID) algorithm to solve it. With some common used assumptions, the authors establish the convegence result for CID. \nIn the experimental studies, the authors compare three instance re-weighted adversarial training methods with the proposed method on four small-scale datasets. The proposed method show promising improvement on RA-PGD, RA-Tail-30 and RA-AA metric."
