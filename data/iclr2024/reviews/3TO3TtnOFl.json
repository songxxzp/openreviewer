Due to the potential loss of accuracy, the authors propose a passage representation recovery objective and a query-aware passage token distillation objective to restore performance. By combining offline and runtime compression, the proposed method speeds up state-of-the-art inference by 4x and reduces storage space by more than 100x in five knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, while maintaining over 95% of task performance."

Experiments are conducted on 5 datasets and provide meaningful comparisons with existing retrieval-enhanced language models such as Atlas and DensePhrase and large language models such as LLaMA2-7B. The results show that the proposed model can maintain 95% of the above task performance while improving the inference speed and greatly reducing the storage space.

While \nauthors only set this factor to a fixed number (40 or 30 for different datasets), thus additional experiments should be involved."

Are there any analytical experiments conducted to substantiate this claim? Additionally, is it viable to utilize a linear layer and sigmoid function for binarization?

These techniques are specific to a certain class of models like BERT and Atlas. And it's not clear that they will generalize to other types of retrieval-augmented LMs. There are many steps in the compression that are all required for good speed and accuracy. These are covered well in the ablation table:\n\n* binary passage representation is needed to reduce storage (speed is almost the same when using the dense passages).\n* offline compression gives a minor improvement in storage and speed at cost of accuracy.\n* online compression gives big speed improvements.\n* passage token distillation improves representation of dense vectors, and is important for good accuracy. This filters for 50 percent of the most salient tokens according to attention, although it is not clear if this was necessary and maybe distillation of 50 percent random tokens would yield similar performance.\n* passage recovery loss for the binary vector retains semantic information of the dense vector, and is important for good accuracy.\n\nThe results empirically show the speed (2-4x) and storage benefits (100x) of BTR, albeit at about 5 percent drop in performance. The paper is clearly very informative with analysis and details, but sometimes some basic details are missing and the benefits of BTR are occasionally oversold."

There is a substantial (about 5 percent) drop in model accuracy. It's not clear whether 2-4x speed boost is enough value to make up for this, although the storage improvements are definitely very valuable.\n\n3. The paper is not very self-contained. It seems like the reader is expected to have read Cao et al and Atlas papers very closely. This is not ideal. For example, it is hard to understand what it means by \"decomposed model\" or \"decomposed reader\" in sec 3.2. Also, the reader is left to infer that retrieval is done at the passage level, but passages are incorporated at the token-level.\n\n4. (minor) The paper is hard to read. In more than one instance, a method is used but is \"defined below\", so we must constantly revisit parts of the reading to get a full understanding.\n\n5. (medium) \"BTR is more accurate and efficient than other baseline methods\" This claim can easily be interpreted as \"all other baselines\", which is not accurate. There are baselines that are more accurate or more efficient. This should probably be revised to be more accurate/specific. Also, I am not sure why BTR base is constantly bolded in Sp column when it is not the best value.\n\n6. There is not a good breakdown of efficiency between retrieval + inference. Perhaps alternative methods akin to DistilBERT will give a substantial speed boost plus keep good performance.\n\n7. (minor) Similarly, given the emphasis on storage it would have been helpful to see some basic baselines to improve storage. Although I am not sure what else can easily achieve 100x savings without larger tradeoff in performance.\n\n8. (very minor) It was confusing whether the token distillation is taken directly from Cao et al, or is something new."
