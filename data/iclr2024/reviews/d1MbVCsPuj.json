                "value": "1. A primary concern is the seemingly ambiguous use of the concept of Pre-trained Models (PTMs). There are very limited details on the data that are used for PTMs during the pretraining stage. The introduction and related work sections give the impression that pretraining follows the convention of using the ImageNet dataset, similar to methods they cited. However, I realize until section 5.2 when the discussion on pretraining across various epochs (1, 4, 6, 10...) is provided, that this is probably not pretrained on the imagenet dataset. However, if the model is pretrained on CIFAR10 (that further used for distillation), one would expect it to naturally have a better performance during distillation. How is it different from the buffer training stage in previous works e.g. [1,2]? \n2. The overall structure and writing of this paper lack clarity and cohesiveness. For example, the decision to space out section 3.2 (experiment setup) and section 5, and to introduce losses in sections 4 and 5.3 separately, results in disjointed reading and necessitates excessive cross-referencing.\n3. Two of the highlighted key findings do not appear particularly new. The model diversification is a pretty established technique that are widely used in a lot of DD works, and domain knowledge part also seems to be a widely known concept. The point is, I do appreciate the authors provided very detailed experiments but I don't think the authors communicate their key findings very effectively in the introduction part.\n4. The paper has a lot of technique details missing e.g. dataset resolution, full dataset training performance, and specifics about datasets used for model pretraining.\n5. For the distilled dataset evaluation using data augmentation techniques. What's the size of the final distilled-then-augmented dataset?  Similarly, as mentioned in point 4, there's an absence of full dataset training performance metrics, especially when data augmentation techniques are applied, which makes it hard to evaluate the results.\n6. In Figure 1, on which dataset was this experiment conducted? It is not identified or described within the paper.\n\n\n[1] Cazenavette, George, et al. \"Generalizing Dataset Distillation via Deep Generative Prior.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2023.\n\n[2] Zhou, Yongchao, Ehsan Nezhadarya, and Jimmy Ba. \"Dataset distillation using neural feature regression.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 9813-9827."
