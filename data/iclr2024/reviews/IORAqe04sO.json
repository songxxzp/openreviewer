                "value": "The study introduces a novel crossover operator for genetic algorithms that is inspired by cellular automata. It outlines the operator's functionality and specifies its application for elementary automata, including two-dimensional automata with von Neumann and Moore neighborhoods. Comparative analyses were conducted, evaluating the proposed algorithm using the cellular crossover operator against standard image classification methods from the Yale face database. The research demonstrates the algorithm's strong performance in classifying new images within the considered image classes. Additionally, the paper proposes future investigations, including exploring the potential integration of the crossover operator into multilayer neural network systems for image recognition. The study also suggests examining the operator's use in generating knowledge assessment tests of varying difficulty levels in the educational sector."

There are many traditional machine learning methods for handling image classification tasks, i.e., SVM, K-tree, MLP, etc. The author only compares the proposed method with KNN, PCA, and KMeans. The comparative experiments are not enough to verify its performance.\n2. The experiment only shows the difference between CGACell-GA and its competitors. It does not analyze the advantage of cellular automata strategy compared to other crossover operators. This research lacks the ablation study to discuss the impact of automata, which leaves a gap between results and conclusions.\n3. The author just tests the performance of all methods on one database. It is a small database including 165 images. It is inadequate to use this database to verify the performance. \n4. Although the author gives some examples of rules 110 and 90, the detailed process still is not clear. It is not clear how to work in high-dimensional condition. Some concepts are hard to comprehend without explaining clearly.\n5. In experiments, How do the authors divide the database? The partition of the database can affect the results. The authors, therefore, should describe the partition details.\n6. The authors should give the details of the compared methods for fair comparison.\n7. Please ensure that acronyms and concepts are defined before using them.\n8. A massive number of symbols are introduced in the formation. The equation and their variables should be explained in a clearer fashion."

Rather than performing a single-point or cycle crossover, offspring chromosomes are obtained by arranging parents chromosomes in a grid, and applying CA rules to generate corresponding bits in the descendants' bit strings. Authors provide a brief experimental assessment of their approach by optimizing the number neighbours used in a KNN for a classification task."

                "value": "- The paper lacks the appropriate tone for a conference article. It feels more as a textbook chapter, or a blog entry aimed at general audiences. It introduces in great details concepts related to CAs, it also spends several lines rambling in general about optimization methods. \n- The related work section is missing the main comparison against other approaches. Although authors do mentions several recent works that combine concepts of CAs with GAs, they never contrast their method with those previous works. They never specify what their contribution exactly is, how their proposed approach fit within the context of the related works.\n- Authors never introduce the motivation or insight behind their entire work. Although the proposed concept is somewhat interesting, they never really explain what motivated them to attempt such approach, or the gains they expected to obtain. Even if their research was motivated by pure curiosity alone, they should have bring in up, clarify it in some way or another.\n- Experimental assessments lacks comparison with proper baselines. Authors perform some experiments in which they utilize their approach to optimize the number of neighbours used in a KNN, and compare against some other classification algorithms and a defaulted KNN. However, since they are proposing a new crossover for binary representation, they should've compared against single point or multi-point crossovers, or even against a hill climbing mechanism.\n- The experimental design and results are unintelligible. Authors claim to test their approach in optimizing the parameters for a classification algorithm (the K in a KNN), and perform some experiments in a classification task; but then somehow the competing approaches they present are clustering and dimensionality reduction methods (Kmeans and PCA), which doesn't make any sense."
