The basic idea is that the brain represents the maps as segmented components.\nThe authors develop algorithms based on this basic intuition and test the algorithms on simulated environments. \nThe authors compared the performance of their method to a method called Frontier (Yamauchi, 1997) and its variants. They reported that theirs carry certain advantages in most scenarios tested here. \n\nOverall, I found this to be a nice paper. It is well written and the ideas were clearly explained. My main concern is about the benchmarking that is, I am not sure if the authors have performed the comparison with the state-of-the-art methods in the field that are relevant to this problem. The method in Yamauchi (1997), while popular, was proposed more than 25 years ago after all."

The paper should discuss the proposed method with respect to such methods.\n\n- the paper's comparison is limited in considering only the standard frontier-based exploration, when in fact there are a number of exploration methods showing better performance than the standard one, both in terms of exploration, as well as planning time.

In fact, for the realistic experiments, in AWS office, memory appears better for Frontier. The size of each local map might depend on the complexity of the environment, but it is worth discussing what affects the determination of the local map in practice.\n\nA couple of minor presentation comments: \n- to be more precise in assumptions and corresponding presentation of functions, it is worth mentioning that the robot is non-omnidirectional, as otherwise the indicator function for whether the frontier edge is spatially behind the agent wouldn't apply. In addition, for that function there would be a threshold to determine what \"behind\" means, with respect to the orientation of the robot.\n- usually white pixels are used for free space, instead of black.\n- \"FRAGMENTAION\" -> \"FRAGMENTATION\"\n- \"that work did not seriously explore\" -> \"that work did not explore in-depth\"\n- instead of calling \"wall-clock time\" it is better to characterize it with \"planning time\""

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the idea of surprise-based submap creation is interesting, many aspects of the overall method are unclear.\n\nWhat does the map representation look like? The information provided appears to be contradicting itself. The C-th channel is said to contain confidence information, but over what? Additionally, the C-th channel in the observation contains visibility information. However, later on, there is talk of occupancy and colors. The actual representation used by the maps is never explained concretely.\n\nAnother aspect that lacks clarity is the surprisal mechanic. It mentions uncertainty estimation yet provides the prediction error as an example. How can an error be used as uncertainty estimation? Equation 2 is also highly confusing as M and o are matrices with different dimensionality yet are multiplied together. How does this work? Furthermore, based on the text, the multiplied quantities represent different properties, making things even more confusing. As it is never made clear what local maps look like and how they are formed, the entire surprisal aspect is challenging to evaluate.\n\nThe recall aspect, which is paramount to reusing existing local maps efficiently, lacks any information regarding how it works. Does the system assume perfect localization and thus can just use the submap graph, or is there a place recognition system that reidentifies these local submaps?\n\nWhile there is crucial information about core aspects missing or relegated to the appendix, there is plenty of detail regarding aspects that one could argue are less critical. For example, the detailed view integration above Section 3.4 or the exact description of the synthetic environment description in Section 4.\n\nThe experiments are not very convincing for several reasons. A major one is that a very basic frontier method is used, of which the details are unclear. The proposed method utilizes several heuristics to avoid making bad choices, are similar heuristics employed in the baseline? Another aspect is that the metrics used are unclear and hard to interpret. As an example, Table 2 shows memory usage with a unit of (k), what does this mean? The paper provides statistical information which is good, though it might be better if either the standard deviation or quantile (likely the better choice) were used throughout rather than switching between the two. While the experiments section is quite long, there is little actual discussion of the results, which is usually the most exciting part of an experimental section.\n\nFrom the description of the baseline method, it is unclear whether it also uses submaps. The results seem to imply so, as otherwise, the relative memory plots should show a value of 1 from my understanding. The paper also does not compare to contemporary exploration frameworks such as GBPlanner (referenced in the appendix) or work such as [1] that are evaluated on realistic robotic 3D setups and show impressive performance. In the absence of such baselines, it is impossible to evaluate the benefit of the proposed irregular submapping system.\n\nWhile the idea of creating submaps in a more dynamic way than typical fixed-size grids is interesting, the amount of questions surrounding the proposed system and lack of comparison with recent methods makes it impossible to support the paper's publication in its current state.\n\n[1] Schmid, Lukas, et al. \"A unified  approach for autonomous volumetric exploration of large scale  environments under severe odometry drift.\" *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters* 6.3 (2021): 4504-4511."
