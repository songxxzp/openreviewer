For Gaussian data distribution, the score function is actually linear. I am surprised in Figure 4 that the non-convex neural estimator trained by DSM cannot recover the ground truth score function. Could you provide some intuition?\n4. The writing can be significantly improved. I suggest adding more interpretations after each theoretical result."

Indeed, Theorem 6.1 and 6.2 show that the obtained sample will follow Gaussian/Gaussian-Laplace distribution, no matter which distribution the training data is from. This defeats the original purpose of diffusion generative modeling. \n2. The convex program in 1 dimension is efficiently solvable (the regularized objective). However, in high dimensions, the convex objective function involves combinatorial sums, which is not efficiently computable. \n\nMinor: \nIn the statement of Theorem 4.2, $D_j = D_j$ when ... and $D_j = 2 D_j - 1$ when ... is not a serious statement."

So it's not clear why this particular problem is being studied.\n- This paper studies a particular weight decay regime, in which the distribution converges to either a Gaussian or Gaussian-Laplace. However, in practice, there is no weight decay. Furthermore, the interesting thing about diffusion models is that they *can* learn more complicated distributions. The simplest example is the mixture of Gaussians, which *even* two-layer neural networks can represent the score of, and which this weight decay regime fails to capture. In practice, of course, the distributions being learned are far more interesting than a Gaussian-Laplace, or even a mixture of Gaussians, and this paper fails to explain any of this.\n- There is a small section studying the denoising score-matching objective (the one actually used in practice), but it seems to again be in the uninteresting weight decay regime (this section is very short, and the results are difficult to interpret). \n- More generally, the presentation is difficult to follow, and things are not well motivated. For instance thereom 4.1 is stated, but no intuition is provided for what it means. The matrices/vectors in the theorem are described in subsequent sections, but again, not much motivation/intuition is provided. It seems like a lot of this should just be pushed to the appendix.\n- The Langevin algorithm is studied for sampling, while in practice, annealed Langevin is used after learning the score at multiple noise levels. None of this is explored in this paper. Furthermore, the sampling result itself seems to be a consequence of classical work, since the distribution learned is always very simple in the weight decay regime studied."
