The performed experiments showed that the pre-trained models can readily encode participant demographics, conditions and medication. The introduced SSL framework incorporates various techniques, such as stochastic augmentation module or participant level positive pair selection proved to behave better than segment level selection. The work flows logically with a comprehensive analysis of how well PPG and ECG embeddings encode participants' information and ablation study of various parameters used in the work. The motivation of the work is clear and the method was compared to other existing techniques proving its robustness."

                "value": "The paper presents a significant advancement in the domain of health monitoring using wearable devices, specifically focusing on the tracking of biosignals, namely photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). Recognizing the potential of these biosignals, the authors highlight a major challenge: the lack of large, curated datasets with medically annotated labels for developing neural network-based biomarkers. To circumvent this, they leverage the Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS) and harness a self-supervised learning framework for training foundation models on PPG and ECG data from approximately 141,207 participants over a span of three years. This self-supervised approach integrates a participant level positive pair selection, stochastic augmentation, and a regularized contrastive loss optimized through momentum training. The authors demonstrate that these pre-trained models encode substantial information related to participant demographics and health conditions. Notably, this work distinguishes itself as the pioneering effort in building foundation models for PPG and ECG using large-scale data sourced from consumer wearables, as opposed to traditionally smaller datasets from clinical settings. The potential applications of these models are vast, with implications for enhancing wearable device capabilities, reducing reliance on labeled data, and ultimately benefiting users' health."

                "value": "Strengths:\n1. **First Work on Foundation Models for Wearable Biosignals**:\nThe research stands out as the pioneering effort to develop foundation models specifically for biosignals\u2014photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)\u2014collected via wearable devices. Such biosignals offer a treasure trove of biological and cardiac information, which can be instrumental in monitoring users' overall health. The convenience of wearable devices combined with the potential of these foundation models paves the way for continuous health tracking without disrupting daily routines, potentially leading to the early detection of health issues.\n\n2. **Extensive Evaluation Using Linear Probing**:\nThe authors conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the trained models using linear probing for a plethora of tasks. This includes gender classification, age prediction, and both classification and regression for Body Mass Index (BMI). Furthermore, they delved into predicting variables extracted from questionnaires, providing a holistic understanding of the models' capabilities. The utilization of smooth effective rank as an evaluative measure underscores the robustness of the evaluation.\n\n3. **Participant Level vs. Segment Level Positive Pairs**:\nAn intriguing facet of the research was the comparison between participant level and segment level positive pairs. This distinction is crucial because the granularity at which positive pairs are chosen can significantly impact the model's performance. The exploration of this dimension offers valuable insights into the optimal approaches for training foundation models on biosignals.\n\n4. **Benchmarking with Other SSL Methods**:\nTo validate the efficacy of their approach, the authors benchmarked their models against established self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, such as SimCLR and BYOL. Such a comparative analysis not only situates the research within the broader landscape of SSL but also provides tangible metrics to gauge the relative performance of their models.\n\n5. **Curation of a Large Dataset**:\nOne of the paper's major contributions is the meticulous curation of a vast dataset from the Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS) for the training of foundation models. With data spanning approximately 141,207 participants over three years, the effort required to curate, clean, and prepare such a dataset for effective training cannot be understated. This endeavor not only underscores the thoroughness of the research but also sets a precedent for future studies aiming to leverage large-scale datasets for health applications."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Exploration of KoLeo Regularization**:\nAn area of potential exploration is the specific impact of the KoLeo regularization on the model's performance. Ablation studies that incrementally remove or vary the strength of KoLeo regularization could provide clarity on its role and efficacy. Such an analysis would help in understanding whether the regularization is crucial for the model's success, and to what extent it contributes to the overall performance. This is particularly important as the unique characteristics of biosignals may interact with regularization techniques differently compared to other domains.\n\n2. **Inclusion of All Results**:\nTransparency and completeness in research reporting are essential for reproducibility and peer review. Therefore, it is recommended that the authors include all results, particularly those referenced as \"results not shown\" within the main body of the paper or the appendix. Having access to these results would allow the scientific community to fully evaluate the findings, methodologies, and claims made within the paper. It would also enhance the credibility and utility of the work for those looking to build upon it.\n\n3. **Augmentation Impact Analysis**:\nThe paper would benefit from a deeper dive into the effects of various augmentation techniques on the performance of the biosignal models. Unlike image data, where the impact of different augmentations is well-studied, the domain of biosignals remains relatively unexplored in this aspect. An appendix providing detailed results and analysis of how different augmentations influence the learning process would be invaluable. This could include which augmentations contribute most to model robustness or performance, and any augmentation-specific phenomena observed with biosignals. Given the novelty of the field, such insights could be highly influential for future research in biosignal analysis.\n\n4. **Demographic details missing**: The paper would benefit greatly from a more detailed presentation of demographic information related to the participants whose data underpin the foundation models. Such information is essential for assessing the diversity and representativeness of the dataset, which in turn, influences the generalizability of the model across various populations. The current omission of granular demographic details leaves a gap in understanding the scope of the model's applicability. It is recommended that the authors include statistics on age, gender, ethnicity, and other pertinent demographic factors. This would not only enhance the transparency of the research but also allow for a more nuanced evaluation of the model's performance across different demographic groups."

While this study is the product of extensive training and evaluation, much of the methodology draws from pre-existing studies. Although there are several SSL studies tailored for time-series data, particularly in the realm of biosignals in healthcare, the authors did not extensively compare different model architectures. Readers might be keen to discern whether biosignal SSL performance is more contingent upon scale or the model architecture itself.\n\n- While this study encompasses two modalities, it seems that the authors have considered them in isolation. Pretrained models have shown effectiveness across varied modalities like images and language. It would be beneficial for the authors to delve deeper into this aspect.\n\n- The pretrained embedding for PPG appears to encapsulate more information than its ECG counterpart. This raises a question: given that PPG is passively sampled and ECG is actively collected by users, could this disparity in data collection methods influence such an outcome? Additionally, conventional clinical diagnoses often rely on 12-lead ECG or periodic information like HRV derived from ECG. It would be valuable if the authors could elucidate more why the ECG embedding doesn't seem as informative as the PPG.\n\n- Lastly, the authors note that positive pairs are drawn from the same individual. However, a person's PPG and ECG patterns can vary based on different conditions or circumstances. It might be more insightful for the authors to determine positive pairs by taking additional attributes into account."

However, I'm curious if two subjects with similar demographic attributes should be distinctly separated.\n\n- While ECG and PPG are pivotal for evaluating physiological status, there are also numerous other parameters to consider, such as HRV, heart rate, and possibly activity levels. The authors might wish to discuss this aspect further."
