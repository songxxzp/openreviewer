The goal is to evaluate the learning with multiple conformers for each molecule. In traditional evaluations of molecular machine learning, the dynamic nature of molecules taking on various possible conformers has been somewhat overlooked. MARCEL addresses this by setting up a possible set of conformers for each molecule and preparing a task to predict the Boltzmann average of molecular properties over the set of conformers, i.e. conformer ensembles. Using this benchmark data, the paper also provides comprehensive empirical evaluations of widely-used 1D, 2D, and 3D GNNs, also examining two strategies of ensemble learning in situations where a set of conformations can be used."

                "value": "In molecular machine learning, considering the dynamic structural transitions of molecules is an extremely important point. While there are studies predicting molecular dynamics simulations through machine learning, and existing research examining the impact and significance of conformers on machine learning predictions, the data and tasks are extremely limited. Thus, objectively comparing multiple methods on the same foundation is challenging. In this context, the benchmark proposed in this paper is extremely intriguing. Moreover, even if one wishes to consider multiple conformers for each molecule in machine learning evaluations, preparing it can be difficult without specialized knowledge. Considering these points, establishing such a benchmark and sharing it within the molecular machine learning community has the potential to enable more constructive methodological research and analysis.\n\nIn this paper, not only is a dataset provided, but comprehensive baseline evaluations are also given that would be useful for researchers looking to enter this field of study. In particular, comprehensive evaluation is conducted using multiple popular GNN models in 1D, 2D, and 3D. These results offer insight into how machine learning methods at each representation level are affected by actual conformation changes, providing very valuable knowledge."

                "value": "In the four tasks developed in this study, the objective is defined as predicting the Boltzmann average of various properties over multiple conformers. Under this goal setting, it seems intuitive that using information from multiple conformers would naturally improve prediction accuracy. Therefore, it has not been proven that 'considering multiple conformers contributes to machine learning predictions of real data (e.g., actual experimental measurements of molecules rather than computed values).' In this sense, the utility of this benchmark remains a bit artificial, and practical values would be unclear.\n\nIt is possible that machine learning predictions based solely on the ground-state structure, as traditionally done, are already practically useful. Regarding how considering multiple conformers contributes to molecular machine learning, the contribution of this study might be limited.\n\nAdditionally, since all four datasets prepared are secondary data from referenced primary data, it's unclear how challenging it would be for researchers to prepare them on their own. While the paper mentions quality control and the removal of redundancies, it's unclear whether there is any original information added to this study."

While Drugs-75K, a subset of the GEOM-Drugs [27], Kraken [33], EE [34], BDE [36] all have associated citations, indicating they are secondary data, it was unclear whether the presented datasets are a simple curated version of these primary data, or if any original information was generated in this study. If there is any original information, it would be very helpful to be clarified.\n\nQ2. Regarding 'Dataset preparation' in the Supplementary Material, why are different methods used to generate conformers depending on the data? (Auto3D for Drugs-75k, Q2MM for EE, Open Babel with DTF?) Is this point not problematic for benchmarking several methods?\n\n\nQ3. While I understand that the 'two conformer ensemble learning strategies' are useful for predicting the 'Boltzmann-averaged value of each property across the conformer ensemble,' can they be said to be generally useful for predicting molecular properties? Could you provide any supported evidence for this claim?\n\n\nQ4. Is the BDE task also about predicting the Boltzmann-averaged value?"
