As a starting point, they use an alternating minimization procedure (AMD) developed in prior works on the same problem. They showed empirically that this procedure can fail to learn the correct representation when there is noise in the observations or non-isotropic covariates, even when the different tasks are identical, and gave a theoretical explanation for the sources of error. Based on their analysis, they propose a modification to the alternating minimization procedure (dubbed DFW) which can handle noisy observations and non-isotropic covariates, and experiments confirm the efficacy of their modification."

The authors give extensive interpretation of their results which greatly contributed to my understanding of the paper. The precise relationship to previous work is made explicit, so readers unfamiliar with this sub-field can still parse the paper and understand its contribution easily.\n\n**Intuitive and well-motivated algorithm.** The shortcomings of the base algorithm (AMD) are explained clearly, as are the modifications the authors proposed in DFW, making for an intuitive algorithm. The modifications are simple, easy to implement, and obtain near optimal sample complexity rates.\n\n**Technical contribution.** The authors remove strong technical assumptions found in previous work. They show both theoretically and empirically that these strong assumptions are necessary for AMD to succeed, and are not merely artifacts of previous proofs. Their results are strong both statistically (obtaining optimal sample complexity) and algorithmically (not requiring access to optimization oracles for non-convex problems, which were assumed in some previous works). Their algorithm is also constructed in such a way that data does not need to be shared in its explicit form across tasks, making it attractive when data privacy is a concern. (Remark: It is unclear if the representation _updates_ from each task will still leak private information, but anyway this is not the main focus of the paper.)"

                "value": "**Theory.** While the assumptions are much weaker than those in related works, some of the assumptions are still very strong. Two in particular stand out.\n1. The representation dimension $r$ is required to be at most $\\min(d_x, d_y)$, where $d_x$ is the dimension of the covariates and $d_y$ is the dimension of the observations (Section 2, just after equation (1)). In the linear regression setting, this would mean that there must be a one-dimensional representation. This is a very strong assumption. It seems like we should still be able to obtain some benefit if the representation only has a lower dimension than the _covariates_. This would more closely mirror practical settings such as e.g. computer vision, where the data are assumed to belong to a lower-dimensional manifold.\n2. Assumption 3.1: It is assumed that the $\\beta$-mixing coefficient follows an _exact_ geometric decay, i.e., $\\beta^{(t)}(k) = \\Gamma^{(t)} \\mu^{(t)k}$ for each task $t$. This should place strong restrictions on the possible types of covariate trajectory distributions. It seems like we should expect the results if the decay is _at least_ geometric in nature, i.e., $\\beta(k) \\leq \\Gamma \\mu^k$ for some $\\mu < 1$.\n\n**Experiments.** The empirical results would be more convincing at showing a fundamental limit on the accuracy for AMD if final accuracy vs. number of tasks was shown at a fixed sample size per task, and showing that this accuracy does not approach 0 as the number of tasks increases. At present, it is just shown for T=25. While DFW does converge in this scenario, in principle, it could just be that DFW has a better sample complexity, but AMD will still eventually converge given enough tasks, albeit at a slower rate. Adding this experiment would strengthen the paper.\n\nA minor point: the title of the OpenReview submission does not match the title on the paper. This should be fixed."

                "value": "1. I am curious why the required number of samples $N$ grows (moderately) with the number of tasks $T$. I assume this is to enforce some sort of uniform bound on the random fluctuations across all of the tasks. Can the authors confirm if this intuition is correct?\n\n2. Is there some intuition for why the representation dimension $r$ must be smaller than both the covariate _and_ measurement dimensions? If this is a necessary assumption, can the authors comment on how they would justify this restriction, especially in the linear regression case when $d_y=1$?\n\n3. In Definition 3.1, is there an implicit assumption that the stationary distribution $\\nu_\\infty$ exists, or are there some conditions imposed on the covariate trajectory distributions which guarantee that a stationary distribution will exist as a consequence?\n\n4. Do the results still hold if the equality for $\\beta(k)$ in Assumption 3.1 is replaced with an inequality?\n\n5. It is very interesting that the use of an MLP allows the original AMD algorithm to overcome the fundamental lower bound on the error present when learning a linear representation (even if the sample complexity is much worse than DFW). Is this just because the quantity being measured (validation loss instead of subspace distance) is different, or would AMD with a linear representation fail to converge to 0 validation loss in this setting? If this is particular to the MLP representation, do the authors have any intuition for why this might be the case?"

It is not clear to me why $\\hat{F}^{(t)}$ is independent from $X^{(t)}$.  To my understanding, for example, the Partition trajectories step (Line 5, Algorithm 1) splits the dataset $N$ to $N_{1}=\\\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n \\\\}$ and $N_{2}=\\\\{x_{n+1}, x_{n+2}, \\dots, x_{n+N} \\\\}$. But they come from the same $\\beta$-mixing stochastic process, will they become independent?\n\n2. What is \"the aforementioned batching strategy\" mentioned in Section 3.2 right after Eq.(5)? It seems that there is no batching strategy mentioned before. \n\n3. The proof for the non-iid case simply says after taking the \"blocking technique on each trajectory\", everything is same as the iid case. First, what is the \"blocking technique on each trajectory\"? Has this technique been introduced before? \n\n4. Then regarding the proof for the non-iid case, I am mainly concerned if the iid case could be simply immigrated to the non-iid case. For example, on page 16 of the supplimentary material, it says \"We observe that since $\\hat{F}(t)$ is by construction independent of ... \" and obtains $$E[FWX\\Sigma^{-1}]=E[F]E[W]E[X\\Sigma^{-1}]$$\nThis equation won't hold for the non-iid case. It is because $F$ here is evaluated using a part of the process $\\{x\\}$ and $\\Sigma$ is estimated using another part of the same process."
