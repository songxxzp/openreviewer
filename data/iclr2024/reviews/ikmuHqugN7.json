This paper proposes to apply the Burer-Monteiro factorization to such formulations, in order to make them as tractable as the original convex formulation. In some cases, this retrieves the original non-convex formulation, and in some cases (such as for ReLU MLPs) it gives a novel formulation. The analysis includes linear but also, for the first time in the literature, non-linear ReLU networks, and it tackles MLPs, ConvNets, and self-attention networks. The overall result is that such Burer-Monteiro factorization allows to obtain algorithms for training 2 layers networks which are as efficient as their original non-convex formulations, but which can have guaranteed theoretical properties such as a bound on the relative sub-optimality gap. Finally, these developments are plugged into a (tractable)  layer-wise training procedure of (deeper than 2 layers) CNNs, which allows them to inherit from the theoretical guarantees developed in the paper (and empirically, such CNNs are comparable to state of the art training of CNNs in term of test error)."

Additionally, the literature review seems exhaustive, and some care was given to the experiments, with the code provided in the supplemental.\n\n### Clarity\n\nI think the paper is clear, with the motivations and main results clearly highlighted.\n\n### Significance\n\nI believe this work is very significant, since ReLU networks (MLPs, CNNs, and self-attention), contrary to linear networks, are actually widely used in the machine learning community. Therefore, I believe the BM formulation obtained in the paper, as well as the theoretical guarantees that follow from it will be of interest to the community. Additionally, the empirical result at the end regarding the training of deeper than 2 layers CNNs is encouraging and hints at the applicability of the results in that paper even to deeper than 2 layers neural networks. Additionally I think that the discussions around the convergence of (S)GD, stationary points, global optima, and the new theoretical developments in the paper related to those issues, will be interesting to the community."

From the experimental section and also after briefly looking at the corresponding code, unless I am mistaken, it seems that training of pure ReLU networks has not been investigated (I think only Gated ReLU and Linear networks were trained in practice ?). Since analyzing (non-gated) ReLU networks are one of the main result of the paper, I think it could have been interesting  (perhaps in Appendix) to just compare in more details, even just on the toy spiral dataset and for 2 layers ReLU MLPs, the training of the BM factorization vs. the original MLP training, since from eq. (19), the two formulations differ, and since BM has some theoretical guarantees which the  original non-convex formulation does not have."

                "value": "- **First of all, there appears to be a mismatch between the title and the actual contents of the paper.** The title is \"Scaling convex neural networks with BM factorization\". However, I found no experimental evidence showing that applying BM factorization to convex neural networks leads to more scalable implementations. In particular, I think the title would be only meaningful if the paper compares the baseline that optimizes the two-layer networks by gradient descent and presents improvements over efficiency. This mismatch also comes with several claims that seem inaccurate to me or lack sufficient justifications. For example, \n   - *The BM factorization is essential for convex neural networks to match deep ReLU networks.* The paper is limited to 2 layer networks, I am not sure whether it is suitable to generalize to deep networks. Even in the 2-layer case, the BM factorization is not shown to be essential or promising compared to the above baseline.\n   - *Without the BM factorization, the induced regularizer of convex CNNs is intractable to compute, and the latent representation used for layerwise learning is prohibitively large.* However, What remains to be justified is this: Why is layerwise training necessary, and why cannot one just train all layers together (as the above baseline)?\n\n\n- **Second, the theorems seem to be straightforward extensions of prior works (e.g., as the paper mentions, Bach et al. (2008) and Haeffele et al. (2014))** Please compare prior works at the technical level. What's the novelty of the paper at the technical level? Please justify. Maybe it makes sense to make a table for comparison.\n\nOverall, I found the paper is focused too much on writing and rewriting the problems in different ways, without making a special effort to actually solve the problems. Having presented many reformulations, the paper leaves the readers wondering whether BM factorization works or not. In particular, the theorems are weaker than the convex counterparts (the latter guarantees global optimality). If the paper is unable to show BM factorization leads to improvements in scalability or efficiency, the values of the proposed approach would be greatly limited.\n\n\nMinor:\n- In Eq. (1), maybe it would be great to have parentheses for the summation term.\n- Sentence below Eq. (5): two \"thereby\", thereby not reading well.\n- The paragraph after Eq. (19): \"*While the original convex program is NP-hard*\". It is unclear to me why convex programs are NP-hard."

Does GD become sublinear convergence when it is close to the optimal due to the ill-conditioning on $U$ and $V$ (using MLP for example, $U$ and $V$ must be rank deficient at optimality due to $m\\geq d+c$)?\n3. Could the authors provide experimental results on demonstrating the scalability of BM formulation? For example, the time and memory complexity (per iteration) v.s. the number of neurons.\n4. Could the authors provide more insight on why it is important to find the global optimum in neural network training? Though the global optimum gives the best training error, it does not guarantee to give the best generalization error. It is entirely possible that the local minimum would have better generalization error than the global minimum. In addition, finding the local minimum is a lot cheaper than solving the BM formulation proposed in this paper."

                "value": "The paper adds to the growing literature of viewing 2-layer nonlinear neural networks (MLP, CNN, self-attention) as convex programs (sometimes with large parameters) to study stationary points of these programs via tools from convex and SDP optimization. In particular, using Burer-Monteiro (BM) factorization, the authors give a different parameterizations of these convex programs and demonstrate empirically that the new parameterization allows for faster computability. They also provide theoretical guarantees of local minima of BM programs being global minima of the original program and bound relative optimality gap of BM programs."

                "value": "I believe the paper is highly interesting, novelly applying existing techniques to a new problem and give ample theoretical and empirical justification for the adoption. \n1. BM theory is shown to be flexible for many different architectures, allowing the authors to show no spurious local minima for linear self attention layer. Although I am not an expert in the theory of transformers, I believe this claim is significant if correct.\n2. BM factorization provides computable objectives for convex 2-layer ReLU networks and is shown empirically to scale under widely used, simple datasets.\n3. If a local minima is obtained, low-rank-ness is sufficient for global optimality."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The proposed BM factorization for nonlinear MLP is nonconvex and it is not certain how to optimize them to obtain local minima (although the authors do provide methods to check optimality and bound the optimality gap to the original formulation)\n2. It appears that BM factorization corresponds to the \"conventional wisdom\" in practical machine learning of \"adding another layer\" to the model and enjoy nicer optimization landscape. The resulting program, then, is nonconvex (as also pointed out by the authors). In light of this, although the authors provide a small paragraph in page 5 comparing BM MLP to original nonconvex problems, it seems that the formulation in the paper is much closer to this original nonconvex problem (and thus needs further comparison) than to the convex formulation in which the framework is developed."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. How feasible is it to generalize this framework to more than 1 hidden layer?\n2. It is hard to keep track of different norm notations at times, so the authors may consider defining all of them at once at least in the appendix. For instance in Lemma 3.1, when R and C are introduced, it's not clear that those are just L^p norm with p = R and C or something else. It's also not clear that ||.||_F corresponds to Frobenius norm or some special norm that comes from the objective function F. \n3. Is there a feasible framework to analyze saddle points of the BM formulation and not just local minima?"
