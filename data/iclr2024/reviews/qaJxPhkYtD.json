(4) What is role of the characteristic function in page 3? Why is it unrelated to x?\n\n2. Regarding the theoretical results:\n   - The authors only proved positive results for the expressive power of GNNs using high-order moments, which are incomplete. Does the GNNs fail without high-order moments? In other words, are the theoretical results tight? For example, can the GNNs count 6-cycle using only 2-order moment, and can the GNNs count 7-cycle using only 3-order moment?\n   - I do not think Theorem 4.1 is meaningful. The theorem uses a GNN to fit the number of connected components of a *single* graph, which is just equivalent to fit a constant if I understand correctly.\n\n3.
