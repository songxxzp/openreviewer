Given that UTC deviations can be represented using DAG decision problems, regret minimization algorithms like CFR, when applied to these decision problems, can also be utilized to minimize linear swap regrets in online convex optimization scenarios. Building upon prior findings, employing CFR as a $\\Phi_{LIN}$-regret minimizer not only promises the same $O(\\sqrt{T}d^2)$ upper bound but also offers superior computational efficiency by avoiding the need for an expensive projection.

These linear deviations have been recently shown to be useful in obtaining sublinear regret in polynomial time for sequential games. Following that, the authors show that UTC deviations are expressible in terms of scaled extensions, which allows them to apply CFR to learn linear correlated equilibrium much faster than the indicative previous work of Farina and Pipis. Finally, several experiments are shown that corroborate the theory and show fast convergence to linear correlated equilibria."

In that sense, the major contribution of this work is introducing UTC as a part of the framework for which fast convergence to equilibria can be obtained. Other than that, none of the other results shown seem technically significant. To alleviate this, more discussion or results about the nature of untimed communication equilibria would be helpful, should space allow (perhaps a section about connections to standard communication equilibria, which has been written in the appendix already)."

The authors take a regret minimization perspective and design their algorithm for computing linear correlated equilibria by designing algorithms that minimize linear-swap regret. They demonstrate an equivalence between linear deviation and a generalization of communication deviations, where the deviator can send untimed queries to the mediator. Hence, minimizing linear swap-regret can be done via minimizing regret defined under such deviations with untimed communications. Invoking a previous result on the latter problem then gives a linear-swap regret minimizer. Experiments based on several types of games are further conducted, which demonstrate significant improvement of the proposed algorithm compared with existing ones."

For example, when communication deviations are introduced, it is said that the deviator will maintain a state with the mediator, but there is no explanation about why there needs to be a state. The introduction of the interaction between the mediator and the deviator also lacks intuitions. Overall, while I find the previous sections clear and informative, Section 3 seems to appear a bit abruptly. It might be helpful to provide some more details about comminication equilibrium, or introduce the concepts in this section along with the example in Section 5 (I think I understand them better after reading the example). \n\nSome typos: \n\n- In Section 5, the sentence \"must immediately its first mediator query\" reads problematic.\n\n- In the paragraph above Section 7, \"this significant(ly) improves\""

In order to further demonstrate the contribution of this work, the authors can have a table which records all existing algorithms for linear-swap regret, as well as their computational complexity. Right now it is a little bit hard for the readers to even identify which of the algorithms (UTC-based CFR or algorithms from Farina and Pipis) are better. Another suggestion is the presentation of Section 5. I understand that the authors want to use the example to demonstrate that UTC is more expressive than communication deviation. However, I spend several hours and still can not get an intuitive understanding about why such a claim hold. For instance, why A and B are 'irrelevant' according to footnote 6? I suggest the authors rewrite Section 5 by reorganizing the Figure 1 into several smaller figures with shorter captions. That would make the demonstration much clearer. \n\nFollowing the above comment, I can not tell what is the key contribution of this work. The main theorem (Theorem 4.1) suggests that the deviation sets $\\Phi_{lin}$ and $\\Phi_{UTC}$ are identical, and later the authors suggested CFR in Zhang et al. can be used to solve UTC, which can be further used to solve linear deviation. How the exactly can CFR be applied to linear deviation? A reduction process is expected, similar to what has been done in Theorem 2.3 (an existing result). Meanwhile, why people are interested in forming the equivalence between UTC and linear deviation but not some other types of game and linear deviation? Last, the authors suggested that the per-iteration complexity of CFR depends on the complexity of computing a fixed point iteration problem. How should we compare such a complexity with previous approaches, like Farina & Pipis (2023)?"
