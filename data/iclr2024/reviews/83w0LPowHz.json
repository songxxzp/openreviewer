                "value": "The notion of graph reconstructability discussed in this paper is very different from graph reconstruction and graph properties in graph theory. Basically, the key idea of recovering a graph in this paper is based on encoding node and edge information, while the other graph topological information/properties (such as cycles, cliques, paths, etc.) are not relevant. In other words, if we assign each node with a unique identity, and then store the identity of a node along with the identities of its neighboring nodes (i.e., edges incident to each node) into its node feature, then a graph can always be represented (or say reconstructed if using the term of this paper) from node features. This is kind of a neural version of representing a graph using adjacency lists. However, this doesn't mean that GNNs with such node features are powerful for representing/learning graph topological information (e.g., cycles, cliques, etc.) that are useful for graph-related tasks. Furthermore, adding such node identities and embedding into node features would lead to the loss of permutation invariance, which is an important property of GNNs when learning structures. For example, two isomorphic graphs where their nodes are assigned with different identity features would have different node representations and become non-isomorphic. Thus, the way of analyzing GNNs in terms of graph reconstructability proposed in the paper does not contribute much to the theoretical analysis of expressiveness of GNNs.\n \nGenerally, the motivation of this work is unclear and misleading. The ability of encoding structural information like adjacency lists of a graph is different from the representational ability of GNNs that can extract useful structural properties for learning. Also, since the input graph is already given and available for analysis, why is it important to encode some additional identity/contextual features (which also cause additional computational cost) into node embeddings to reconstruct the input graph again? Particularly, on one hand, the cost of adding these feature initialization schemes is high; on the other hand, the addition of these feature initialization schemes cannot preserve the permutation invariant property.\n\nThe paper also has some technical issues. More specific comments are included in the next section for questions.\n\nThe clarity of the paper also needs improvement. Some statements are not self-contained. For example, the affliction matrix in Proposition 7 is not defined."

For the definition of context features, why are they defined in terms of labels? Do you assume that label information of every node is available both in training and testing? Also, for the sentence \"the contextual features include both signal (label information) and noise...\" on Page 5, does signal in this paper refer to label information?\n\n4. For the paragraph under Proposition 5, the authors mention \"By contrast, GIN exploits $\\epsilon$ to preserve the central node\u2019s identity, ...\". What does \"the central node's identity\" mean in terms of contextual features discussed here? \n\n5. The reason why GIN can approximate the 1-WL test is not only due to an irrational number $\\epsilon^{(k)}$, but also the injectivity of the sum aggregation function. The proposed GRNN adds $w_j$ before each $\\mathbf{h}_j$. This changed form cannot preserve the injectivity of node features in the aggregation any more. Does this matter for GRNN?\n\n6. For the sentence \"It is not feasible to distinguish the model capability in the real-world graph by GRR because each dataset contains one instance and thus only returns 1 or 0\", what does this mean?"

Specifically,\n\n1. For the graph-level tasks, the relationship of the graph reconstructability and expressivity of GNNs is not discussed nor evaluated. It has been shown that positional encoding (including identity features) can improve the expressivity of GNNs beyond 1-WL. However, this paper fails to provide further theoretical results of reconstructability and expressivity in GNNs, and no experiments empirically evaluates GRNNs against the state-of-the-art GNNs in graph prediction tasks. Hence, it is not straightforward how GNNs will benefit from improving the graph reconstructability in graph-level predictions. At least, I recommend to do more graph prediction experiments to compare GRNNs with other SOTA expressive GNN models. \n\n2. For the link-level tasks like link prediction. the current experiments are not sound due to the lack of necessary benchmark datasets and benchmarks. I recommend to implement additional experiments on well-adopted OGB dataset [1] such as ogbl-ppa, ogbl-collab, ogbl-ddi, and compare GRNNs against GCN/GIN with recent strong labeling tricks including Double Radius Node Labeling (DRNL) in SEAL and Distance Encoding (DE) [2]. DE is a valid labeling trick which is permutation equivariant, while DRNL helps to learn structural link representations with a node-most-expressive GNN. Similarly, the community detection task should also add at least one more benchmark dataset.\n\n3.

On a similar note, there is no mention of subgraph GNNs or the concept of graph reconstruction (i.e., reconstructing a graph from its subgraphs) [3]. A more comprehensive discussion of the contribution and its placement in the current literature would be helpful in assessing its novelty and impact.\n\n**Theoretical results**: The theoretical analysis would benefit from more rigorous/formal definitions, in particular when introducing novel concepts. Definition 1 defines graph reconstructability as \"the ability of a model to predict the input adjacency matrix from the node features\". One possible interpretation of this definition would be to have a machine learning model which learns to predict the adjacency matrix of a graph from (raw) node features (which, according to my current understanding of the paper, is not what graph reconstructability means). Proposition 6 and 7: Here it would be helpful to formalize the natural language statements. Regarding the proofs presented in the appendix, I had a difficult time understanding some of the notation (e.g., $E$, please refer to the questions for more details). Overall, I was not able to verify some of the theoretical results due to imprecise statements (Proposition 6, last two sentences in proof: \"Note that the value of inner prodcut between two nodes indicating the Jaccard similarity, the portion of the common neighborhood over the total neighborhood since the inner product of two none without any shared neighborhood should zero. The proposition follows\".)\n\n**Experiments**: \"By combining NORF and contextual features (which would be naturally used in applications), our GRNN achieved the best performance among baselines.\" For Table 1, this is only true for the Actor dataset. In general, the results of the baseline methods (GCN, GIN, GAT, SGC) seem comparable to GRNN. Minor remark: The plots are very small and therefore difficult to read.\n\n**Clarity and writing**: The writing could be improved, sometimes there are grammar/language errors and imprecise statements:\n\n* \"[...] show that the message-passing GNNs are no more powerful than the 1-WL test, i.e. distinguishing whether two graphs are isomorphic\" -> e.g. \"in distinguishing whether...\" if not it is easy to misunderstand that 1-WL is able to distinguish all non-isomorphic graphs\n* \"[...] our proof is also held [...]\" -> our proof also holds\n* works -> work\n* extended for -> extended to\n* \"not provable to\" -> this sounds off, maybe, e.g., \"provably distinguishes\" or even just \"can distinguish\"\n* \"affliction matrix\" -> affiliation matrix?\n* Pudmed -> Pubmed\n\n[1] http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/chanpuriya21a/chanpuriya21a.pdf\n\n[2] https://doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?ID=1820-02141900011L\n\n[3] https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZKbZ4mebI9l"

                "value": "1. It is not easy to directly interpret the experiment results, such as having no bolding for best results. Also to see the effectiveness of NORF, maybe adding an increase/decrease of performance compared to the IF(Identity Features) would be intuitive for readers to understand.\n2. The purpose of using a new measurement for the expressivity of GNNs was to maintain the topological information of the whole graph in a node embedding. However, the authors have placed link prediction experiments in the main paper, while placing node classification experiments in the appendix. The performance and meaningfulness of node classification experiments seems to be bigger, it would have been better to place node classification experiments in the section 6 experiments of the main paper."

                "value": "1. The paper suggests a new line of research for the expressivity of GNNs, replacing the WL-test. If a node embedding from a GNN has a high graph reconstructability, i.e., topological information of graph well maintained in node representation, doesn\u2019t this also lead to a more expressive graph level representation? (Since most graph level representation is obtained by pooling all the nodes in the graph)"
