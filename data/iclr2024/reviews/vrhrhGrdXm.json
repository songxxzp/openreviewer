The model is able to perform joint modeling of an entity's properties due to the hybrid diffusion training approach. The experimental results on a device KB and a nuclear physical dataset demonstrate the model's capability in representation learning for entity completion in diverse settings. The model is demonstrated to share information across properties and have various downstream uses for scientific applications. The inherent probabilistic nature of the model enables predictions accompanied by uncertainties."

Such a method stands out among the popular autoregressive models. \n\nQuality: The paper carefully designs the experiments to support the idea and improve their illustrations with helpful visualizations.\n\nClarity: The paper effectively communicates its ideas and findings with clarity. The paper is well-written, and the logic is coherent. Necessary mathematical deductions are presented for better understanding of the diffusion process. \n\nSignificance: The model proposed in the paper successfully handles heterogeneous property types along with hierarchical encodings with semantic meaning for different property types, and demonstrates its potential in various downstream scientific tasks. Besides, the model has an edge over traditional autoregressive models due to its inherent probabilistic nature."

Although the authors make clear introductions to the hybrid diffusion training paradigm, the explanation for the model architecture is not clear enough (sometimes even confusing). In fact, the first of my two questions is because of not understanding the architecture here. I suggest the authors can modify Figure 5 and 6 to make the pipeline transparent to readers and include more details in the texts in an ordered way.\n\n2. Although the inherent probabilistic nature of the model makes it suitable for prediction tasks for scientific scenario, I still believe that comparisons between the KBFormer and some regression model baselines should be included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. Besides, in order to illustrate the model's capability in scientific applications, more experiments on benchmarks from other disciplines like molecules, proteins, etc., are required."

                "value": "1. In terms of the model architecture, I suppose the output from the encoder is $(3, feature size)$ for the example shown in Figure 5. If that is true, I'm wondering why it is necessary to use a transformer model with such a short \"sequence length\".\n\n2. Transformer encoders are used to encode text fields. However, if the text is simply a property value (e.g. \"iPhone\" in Figure 5), why not just use a pretrained word embedding?\n\n3. The diffusion training strategy is a promising solution for probabilistic-based generative models. However, is the diffusion paradigm the optimal method to do this? Is there any other generative model (or even regressive model) that does not rely on the noise and denoise process?"

The paper also introduces some terms without proper definitions, such as \u201can infinite bin limit approximation\u201d and \u201cdiscretization with a large but finite bin density\u201d. It would be helpful to provide more details and intuition behind these concepts.\n\n3) The paper needs to improve its writing quality and clarity. Some specific issues are:\nProposition 1: The font of the proposition should be consistent and italicized. Is a proof provided  in the appendix?\nPage 6: The phrase \u201c\u2026 see Section 3.2.\u201d should be enclosed in parentheses, as it is not part of the main sentence.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Chen, T., Zhang, R. and Hinton, G., 2022.

Can you clarify?  \n\n3) For experiments in section 5.2, what is the evaluation method? It is also worth comparing it with other models such as fine-tuned LLaMA2.  Also, for the evaluation of experiment in 5.1, please provide more clarification or examples for rotating each dictionary\u2019s fields D times and predicting only the last value."
