                "value": "This paper presents a novel approach to accelerating sampling from denoising diffusion models without sacrificing image quality. This approach is based on the idea that not every generation step is equally difficult nor equally important for the quality of the final image. The authors propose using *slimmable networks* to prune the network weights at less-important generation steps, and combine this with an evolutionary search method to identify which steps can be safely pruned without sacrificing image quality. The authors demonstrate that their method reduces the FLOPs required for multiple datasets while achieving comparable or better sample quality (FID) than the unpruned methods, and further show that it can be combined with the adaptive step-skipping of DDIM or with latent diffusion for further improvements. They also visualize the learned pruning schedules for different datasets, and show that the set of safely-prunable generation steps differs depending on dataset structure."

This approach also seems quite novel. I'm not aware of any previous work that has considered adaptively using different network sizes at different timesteps.\n\n**[S2]** The authors show that their approach is actually complementary to existing acceleration methods like DDIM, and yields additional improvements when combined. I expect that the approach could also be combined with some of the more recent ODE-based acceleration methods like DPM-Solver, since the proposed DDSM technique is agnostic to the exact mathematical sampling process and instead adaptively shrinks the network itself.\n\n**[S3]** The empirical results are quite strong across multiple datasets. The authors show significant cost savings relative to sampling from the full model, and actually show slight *improvements* in sample quality for all but one of the datasets (LSUN-bedroom takes a small hit).\n\n**[S4]** The approach is easy to understand and seems like it would not be too difficult to implement. The authors also plan to release their code.\n\n**[S5]** I found the results of the pruning schedule search to be quite insightful. Different datasets show different amounts of pruning, and this pruning occurs at different times, which seems to match whether the dataset has more information in its high-frequency or low-frequency components."

However, these aren't discussed in much detail. I think the paper could benefit from some additional background on what slimmable networks are and how they work, and more details on the particular slimmable network architecture used for this work. (In particular, how many slimmable switches were used, and how do they fit into the U-Net architecture?)\n\n**[W2]** The objective for the evolutionary search algorithm is also presented at a fairly high level and could use more details. The authors mention using NSGA-II to \"balance conflicting objectives\", but it's not clear to me what objectives were used. Algorithm 2 suggests that the search objective was a linear combination of FID and FLOPS, but the details of the linear combination weights are not specified.\n\n**[W3]** Although the contributions of this work do seem orthogonal to some of the more recent work in accelerating diffusion model sampling, I think the experimental results would be more impressive if they could also be demonstrated for these more recent accelerated sampling approaches like DPM-Solver, [DPM-Solver++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01095) or the recent [UniPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04867).

                "value": "Could you provide more details on the slimmable network architecture and on the configuration of the search algorithm, as I discuss in [W1] and [W2]? For the search algorithm, what was the value of $w_M$ used, and how critical is this choice? (Or, are the FID and FLOPs measurements automatically balanced by NGSA-II somehow?)\n\nFigure 4a and Figure A are quite interesting, but they also look somewhat blurry. I can sort of see some fuzzy \"bands\" at different points of the trajectory; are these actual changes in the slimmed model size or are these some sort of compression artifact in the figure image? Also, what is the resolution of the X axis here, e.g. where are the boundaries between different steps? It's hard to understand exactly what the plot is showing, and I think this plot would be more readable if it were presented as a line graph (instead of as a heatmap), since its only 1 dimensional.\n\nI found some very recent related work [\"Structural Pruning for Diffusion Models\" (Fang et al. 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10924) which was just accepted at NeurIPS. That work also considers pruning in order to speed up diffusion model inference, although I believe they only consider pruning the entire network rather than adaptively pruning at different timesteps. It might make sense to discuss this related work in your paper, and I'd also be curious how your approach compares to theirs in terms of FLOPs savings.\n\nHave you explored combining your DDSM approach with some of the more recent accelerated sampling approaches? And do you still observe runtime improvements for those methods?"

It's evident that the prevalent approach to enhancing diffusion speed, in the context of network compression, hinges on the application of post-training quantization techniques. These techniques enable the compression of neural networks in a manner that circumvents additional training [1,2]. However, I observe that your method necessitates training and, notably, falls short in performance when compared to methods that forego training. To illustrate, empirical assessments show that DDSM facilitates computational reductions of 49% for CIFAR-10 and 76% for ImageNet. In contrast, the techniques in [1,2] manage to achieve 4 or 8-bit quantization (surpassing DDSM in speed) without compromising the FID score. It's crucial to underscore that these methods achieve this efficiency entirely without the need for further training. Consequently, the approach employed by DDSM for accelerating denoising doesn't appear to be robust enough.\n\n\n[1] PTQ4DM, CVPR 2023\n\n[2] Q-dfiifusion, ICCV 2023"
