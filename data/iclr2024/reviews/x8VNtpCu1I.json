This paper wants to study the question of whether encoder-only models such as the BERT family, can also be instruction-tuned and exhibit zero-shot task-generalization abilities. \n\nTo do so, they first develop a new MLM training scheme that mimics the Seq2Seq training paradigm by concatenating source and target sequences to feed into BERT but with proper masking so that the source sequence tokens won't attend to the target sequence tokens. When training, they mask some tokens from the target sequences to do MLM training. During inference, they first predict the length of the sequence and then iteratively predict masked tokens (all tokens are [MASK] at the beginning). \n\nThey then did instruction tuning on the 3.5B XML-R backbone model with the multilingual xP3 dataset. The performance is somewhat comparable to baselines like BLOOMZ-3B and mT0-3.7B, although still lagging behind on language generalization, generation tasks, few-shot learning, etc.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nPOST-REBUTTAL UPDATE:\nI'm raising my score from 5 to 6."

My biggest takeaway is that you can also do instruction tuning on encoder-only models. But why is that particularly \"surprising\"? To be fair, I'd be surprised it actually works much better than decoder-only or encoder-decoder models because then it means that the popular approach is wrong and they should go back to encoder-only models instead. But based on your experiments, it's not the case, decoder-only and encoder-decoder models still seem better at similar sizes. \n\n- The experiments are not exactly controlled in the sense that, your baselines - BLOOMZ-3B and mT0-3.7B, are not even based on the same backbone model as Instruct-XMLR. This means that many confounders (e.g., pretraining data / steps) exist for making any scientific conclusions based on the experiments."

Initially, you were describing it as if you train a separate \"decoder\" MLM, and H_{src} and H_{tgt} are from the two different models. But what I think you are actually doing is that, you just concatenate the source and target sequence and feed into the same BERT model, but with a modified masking scheme, such that source sequence tokens cannot attend to target sequence tokens."

As the authors have pointed out, the text generation capabilities, one of the arguably most important capabilities of language models, is still weak for Instruct-XMLR. This may limit the significance of this work.\n3. Also arguably not a deal-breaker, but the compute resource (8xA100, unclear 40GB or 80GB, PCIe or SXM) and the model size (3.5B params on 0.6B tokens) may still be too small compared to cutting-edge decoder-only equivalents."
