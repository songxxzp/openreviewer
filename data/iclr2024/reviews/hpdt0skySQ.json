The influence of the classification loss on the robustness should also be discussed. \n2. This paper shows the inference phase of the proposed method in the Figure 1 with two steps. Yet, it would be more sufficient to clarify the influence of converted image and reconstructed image in the section of experiments with more empirical evidence such as some visualization results in the process of generation. The analysis of choosing hyperparameters in the training process of this framework should also be provided in the experiments. \n3. This paper mentioned that the GAN inversion technique is a costly one and performed only once in the best-case scenario for saving time during the inference.
