                "value": "This paper introduces a novel method for federated learning on non-iid data, with a particular focus on client sampling. The proposed method expands upon clustered sampling, making it hierarchical. Existing methods cluster clients into groups based on the similarity of their local updates, selecting one client per group to avoid redundant updates. However, the proposed method differs in several ways. Firstly, the server estimates the heterogeneity of each client's data based on the entropy of soft-max outputs. This estimation characterizes each client group based on average heterogeneity. In the proposed hierarchical scheme, client groups are initially sampled based on their average heterogeneity, with groups demonstrating higher heterogeneity having a greater chance of selection. Following this, clients are sampled from the selected groups based on client weights p_k (batch size). The paper also provides a convergence analysis. Experimental results on three image datasets (FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

These ideas have proven to be more effective compared to some other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Clarity**: The work's motivation is clear. Sophisticated client sampling is indeed necessary for FL with a large number of clients, where standard random sampling may not always be the optimal solution. The relationship to prior work, especially the clustered sampling strategy (Fraboni et al., 2021), is clearly stated.\n\n**Significance**: The proposed method significantly improves training speed, ranging from 1.63x to 7.3x across multiple datasets."

                "value": "**Clarity**: The organization of Section 3 could be improved. It currently includes background ideas, existing approaches, and the proposed method, making it difficult to identify the novel aspects of this work. A possible solution could be to split it into two sections: \"Preliminaries\" and \"Proposed Method\".\n\n**Applications to other tasks**: The proposed method has only been proven effective on image classification tasks (FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100). It remains unclear whether the method can be extended to non-classification tasks (e.g., regression) or non-image tasks (e.g., NLP).\n\n**Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods without client sampling**: The significance of the proposed method over existing client sampling-based approaches such as pow-d, CS, and DivFL is clear. However, the necessity for client sampling is not. There are numerous methods addressing non-iidness in FL, not just FedProx, but also Scaffold [Karimireddy et al. 2020], Scaffnew [Mishchenko et al., 2022], FedNova [Wang et al., 2020], FedOpt [Reddi et al., 2021]. The contribution of the proposed method would be clearer if it were compared against these non-sampling-based methods quantitatively in terms of training speeds and communication/computation overheads."

Specifically, this paper found the relationship between the last layer's bias and the distribution of all labels in a given client's local data. By applying the Hierarchical Clustered Sampling technique, the server can compute this estimation for all clustered groups from a random sampling. By picking clients with the highest estimation, the server will aggregate clients with more balanced labels without knowing the exact distribution of the local data.
