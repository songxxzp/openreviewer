However, this formulation does not consider the potential correlation between different components of $\\bf g^t$. In other words, it implicitly assumes the components of $\\bf g^t$ are uncorrelated, which looks too strong.\n\n2. The optimal coefficient only considers the current variable $\\theta^t$, but it is unclear how it affects the convergence rate of the algorithm in theoretical. The existing analysis only provide a greedy view, while I am more interested in the global theoretical guarantees of proposed algorithms.\n\n3. It is well-known that stochastic recursive gradient methods has the optimal stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity for nonconvex optimization. For example, SVRG can find $\\epsilon$-stationary point within $n+n^{2/3}\\epsilon^{-2}$ SFO calls (Allen-Zhu & Hazan, 2016; Reddi et al., 2016), while SPIDER only requires $n+n^{1/2}\\epsilon^{-2}$ (Fang et al., 2018), where $n$ is the number of individual functions.

Although it can be observed both intuitively and empirically that $\\alpha_t$ should be decreased within an epoch, it could be a bit too arbitrary to conclude that $\\alpha_t$ should be decreasing **linearly**. It's hard to see why it is preferred over other schedules, e.g., $\\alpha_t=O(t^{-r})$ or $\\alpha_t=O(q^{-t})$.\n4. The part where the proposed method is applied to AdamW is a bit unclear. Could the authors guide me to previous works where SVRG is combined with adaptive momentum methods, if there is any? If there is, then the authors may want to refer to these works and build the proposed method based on the previous ones; otherwise it is worth discussing in greater detail how SVRG can be combined with AdamW, as the effect of the variance estimator could be more complicated due to the existence of moments.\n5.
