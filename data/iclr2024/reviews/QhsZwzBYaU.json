The proposed method changes the underlying distributions used for sampling interpolation coefficients by defining warping functions, allowing inputs and labels to be disentangled, and providing a framework that encompasses several variants of Mixup. To this end, the author introduces a similarity kernel that considers the distance between points when selecting a parameter for the warping function. This paper demonstrates the applicability of the Kernel Warping Mixup across classification and regression tasks, and cites improvements in performance, calibration, and efficiency while it requires less computation, additionally."

                "value": "- Compared to RegMixup, the proposed method brings marginal improvement in classification task accuracies on different models (Tables 2 and 3). Plus, the benchmark result of the Manifold Mixup in classification is missing. The concern is on the expressivity of the proposed method since general data augmentation aims to enrich the diversity of data and cover more uncertain data points as much as possible instead of encouraging similar data to be mixed more.\n\n- The warped Gaussian Kernel into the original Beta distribution for the mixup coefficient $\\lambda$ highly depends on batched data similarity. If the batch size is small (for large-scale tasks), the relative distances among the data will collapse, i.e. the same samples will be mixup with different $\\lambda$ whether an outlier appears. In Eqn (6), if $n$ is small, the total distance is sensitive to the largest sample distance. It weakens the robustness of the proposed method.\n\n- The evaluation and explanation of how the proposed method enhances calibration over vanilla Mixup are insufficient. For example, (Thulasidasan et al., 2019) have concluded that label smoothing in Mixup training significantly contributes to improved calibration, supported by comprehensive observations such as \"score of winning class along the time\" and \"overconfidence\". C-Mixup (Yao et al., 2022a) provides the theoretical justification for Theorem 3. To enhance the comparison, it would be better to establish a more meaningful connection between the proposed method and calibration, moving beyond only the presentation of ECE and Brier scores. \n\n=====================Typos==============\n\n- Missing reference to the initial mention of \"MIT\" in Section 2.2.\n- In Eqn(6), the LHS should indicate the dependence of $n$ if the measure on RHS depends on all $n$ samples."

As suggested by (Wang et al., 2023), Mixup fails to improve the calibration in terms of other metrics such as Calibrated ECE and Optimal ECE. Can the author explain more or provide more evidence that the method in this paper does help the calibration? Why does altering the underlying distribution of $\\lambda$ yield a better calibration over vanilla Mixup, even with the same similarity measure of input and output (Row 2 in Table 1)?\n\nI am keenly awaiting the author's response to see how they address my concerns, and I am open to increasing my score based on the response."

As a result, combining these two types of ideas to formulate a new algorithm, like the one proposed in this paper, is also intuitively and empirically straightforward, and doesn't seem to be much surprising or interesting. In my opinion it the amount of contributions in this work is not sufficient to be a full paper in ICLR.\n\n2. As a experiment-based work, the datasets used in the experiments are not adequate. For example, in classifications the authors only investigated their proposed algorithm on image datasets. In fact, some datasets, especially the ones with lower dimensionalities, tend to benefit less or even negatively from mixup, and also L2 distance between data points in these datasets may be more statistically meaningful. Such datasets are also worth of experiment verifications of the Kernel Warping Mixup. This also applies to the regression tasks.\n\n3.

How is the cross-validation used to find the hyperparameters conducted in details? Is it conducted before the real training? Or is it conducted simultaneously during the training? What objective is considered in finding the \"optimal\" $\\tau$'s?\n\n5. Algorithm 1. It seems that the values of $\\tau$'s for the inputs and the targets are computed in the identical way. Then what is the point of defining them separately? And also, if the $\\tau^o$ is computed separately, how would one define the similarity between two one-hot labels in classifications? Is it going to be like a simple equity indicator function?\n\n6. Section 4.2. Why is the input distance or embedding distance not taken into consideration here?

For example, the authors should provide some visualizations of effects or statistics to demonstrate the problem in addition to Figure 1.\n\n* (W2) Weak experiments. In comparison to recently published works on mixup augmentation, this paper lacks comprehensive and solid comparison experiments to verify the effectiveness from three aspects. (a) The compared baselines are restricted to classical methods in classification tasks, and the performance gains are limited in all comparison results. These results make me doubt the importance of the studied problem in this paper, i.e., mixing more similar mixup samples than less similar ones. (b) The experiments are small-scale (e.g., CIFAR-10/100) with classical network architectures (ResNet variants) and old-fashioned baselines. There are many open-source mixup methods and benchmarks for classification and regression tasks [1, 2], and I suggest the authors consider more practical and modern experiment settings (e.g., large-scale experiments on ImageNet, modern Transformer backbones on CIFAR-100). (c) Since the proposed method is orthogonal to these mixup methods that improve mixup policies of samples (e.g., CutMix variants [3, 4], or randomly combining Mixup and CutMix [5]) or labels (e.g., TransMix [6], Decouple Mixup [7], and MixupE [8]), the authors should verify whether the proposed method can improve these existing mixup algorithms, rather than only test upon the vanilla Input Mixup.\n\n* (W3) Hyper-parameter sensitivity. As shown in Appendix D and E (Table 6), the hyper-parameters of the proposed method vary significantly on different datasets and tasks. The ablation and sensitivity analysis of these hyper-parameters should be added. Meanwhile, I wonder how the authors determine the two hyper-parameters, which should be detailed in the appendix.\n\n* (W4) The related work section is not well presented. I suggest the author combine Sec. 2.2 and Sec. 3.1 as a new section called Preliminary.
