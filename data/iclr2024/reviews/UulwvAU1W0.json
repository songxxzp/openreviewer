                "value": "This paper introduces the fourier transporter, a neural architecture that explicitly captures the bi-equivariant relationships implicit in many pick and place tasks, that is, an object may exhibit rotational symmetry in both picking actions, and placing actions. The architecture first selects an appropriate pick pose using a network that outputs a distribution over picking actions (positions and orientations), with positions used to crop a region about the object to be placed.  This region is then lifted to form a stack of rotated features (a steerable filter) by a network to capture the rotational symmetry present in the picking action. The fourier transform of these features is applied, and used to perform cross-correlation (in the fourier domain, to allow for more efficient computation) with a feature map generated over the workspace observation to determine a distribution over placing positions.   A coarse to fine approach is used to refine the resolution of the pick and place actions, by sampling more rotations as required to refine the pick and place actions. Behaviour cloning experiments are conducted on a range of simulated 3D and 2D manipulation tasks (RLBench, Raven) and show improved success in terms of success rate as a function of training demonstrations. Ablations appear to indicate that most of the heavy work is done by the lifting operation."

                "value": "The core weakness of this work is the strength of the contribution when compared to the equivariant transporter network proposed in Huang 2022. As far as I can tell key differences include generalising to 3D, more empirical experiments in this domain, and the implementation of the cross correlation in the fourier domain. As mentioned in this work, it is true that the Huang 2022 paper only considers SO(2), and is a subset of the general theory presented here, but more needs to be done to justify why the extension to 3D is non-trivial, particularly when it comes to the major claims of this work, greater angular resolution, computational benefits of fourier implementation, and sample efficiency. \n\nAlong these lines, I would have liked to see an explicit experiment showing clear evidence of higher angular resolution performance (beyond the 15/7.5 degree results in table 2).\n\nNo error bars are provided in experiments (Tables 1/2), so we have no indication that the results are significant. I am sure they are, but this is important for the table 2 comparison with Huang 22.\n\nThe mapping between Figure 2 and the equations in Section 4 is incomplete, and not easily followed. Not all notation is clearly defined (eg. $Ind_{\\rho l}, \\rho_{irrep}, h$ etc.) and equations don't immediately use the network notations ($\\psi, \\phi$). I recognise that much of this notation is standard in group theory, but it is not in robot learning, so there would be value in defining this. This forces the reader to make assumptions/ spend significant time interpreting the mappings between text and figures, and hurts readability. I also recognise that this is out of a desire to formalise and explain the general problem before introducing the specifics of the architecture and approach taken to address this, but the current structure of this section/ group theory jargon made this difficult to follow.\n\nHaojie Huang, Dian Wang, Robin Walters, and Robert Platt.

Is it possible to share some data on the typical distributions and tolerances in pick/place angles the tasks here require?\n\nCould you explain table 3 in more detail - the  ablation here appears to undermine many of the choices this work makes. If a unet + data augmentation can capture many of the equivariance relations, and the lifting operation is the big contributor, then why do we need bi-equivariance? Is this simply an artifact of the test scenarios not adequately evaluating 3D equivariance symmetries?\n\nIn terms of the extension to 3D, it seems that the lifting operator introduces challenges around partial occlusions, that may be hard to learn regardless of the bi-equivariance structure. Could you comment on the general performance/ potential limitations in this regard?"
