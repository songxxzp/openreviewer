                "value": "In this paper, the authors introduce a novel technique known as Positional Skip-wise Training (PoSE) for extending the context window of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing methods like Positional Interpolation (PI), YaRN, and NTK Interpolation have proven effective in extending the context window of LLMs, they require extensive fine-tuning of the LLM with the entire context window. This fine-tuning process imposes a high computational cost due to the quadratic complexity of LLMs relative to the length of the context window.\n\nTo address this challenge, the authors propose a strategic approach during training by selectively skipping certain positions in the middle for each batch. As illustrated in Figure 1, this technique allows the model to effectively perceive a context length of 8192 tokens while using a training-time context window of just 2048 tokens. Consequently, this method significantly reduces the training cost. When evaluated on prominent long-context datasets, including GovReport, Proof-pile, and PG19, the authors demonstrate that PoSE achieves comparable performance to full-context fine-tuning, all while delivering a substantial speedup (as shown in Figure 3)."

The results presented in Table 1 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in extending the context of Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, the performance of PoSE is comparable to that of full-length fine-tuning, highlighting the evident benefit of skipping contiguous token chunks.\n\n3. PoSE excels in both memory reduction and computation time, as illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n4. PoSE proves to be adaptable across various positional encoding interpolation methods, including linear, NTK, and YaRN, thereby enhancing its versatility and applicability."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I am uncertain about whether PoSE has genuinely extended the contextual window. While the current PPL evaluation results are undoubtedly promising, there's a possibility that methods demonstrating low PPL on PG19/GovReport might not effectively comprehend longer contexts. It's possible that the proposed method excels in consistently generating fluent text over extended periods but falls short in truly grasping the nuances of extended context. If that is the case, the potential impact of PoSE could be rather limited, since there are training-free methods (StreamingLLM, LM-Infinite) that can achieve this goal.\n\nTo address this concern, I recommend that the authors consider conducting additional experiments using benchmarks like LongBench and ZeroSCROLLS. Additionally, employing benchmarks utilized by Llama 2 Long could provide valuable insights into the capabilities of PoSE in handling more extensive contextual information."

            "questions": {
                "value": "I believe that PoSE demonstrates proficiency in both PPL and key retrieval evaluations. I look forward to your response to my inquiry regarding the real extension of the context window, as mentioned in the Weaknesses section.\n\nIn addition, I am curious about the performance of the proposed method when the first trunk does not initiate from position 0. Recent concurrent works, such as LM-Infinite and StreamingLLM, have highlighted the significance of retaining the first few tokens in the KV cache for zero-shot context extension, without requiring fine-tuning. I am intrigued to know if the design of $u_0=v_0=0$, which resembles the approach proposed in these two papers, holds the same relevance when applied to a fine-tuned LLM. It would be greatly appreciated (though not obligatory) if the authors could include a discussion on the efficacy of fine-tuning in comparison to these zero-shot methods. For example, does the PPL on long context benchmarks improve with PoSE? Does PoSE unlock new capabilities which zero-shot methods do not have? I will update the score to 8 if the authors provide interesting discussions."
