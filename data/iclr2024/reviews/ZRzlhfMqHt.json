The paper tries to improve the efficiency of the existing segment-based transformer model by two aspects: 1) the paper proposes the periodic attention block where data points in the same segments are first processed using self-attention and then only the data points with the same periodic indexed are processed together using a second self-attention. 2) The paper uses a random attention block on the feature where the features are firstly randomly partitioned into blocks and self-attention is applied accordingly based on the partitioning structure. The paper shows improved performance on the majority of time series forecasting task with improved efficiency."

                "value": "1. It seems that to make the periodic attention work, the model needs to know the right periodic interval of the time series. In some cases, this could be easy as we know the data is collected hourly/daily/etc but in the more general setting it may require to infer the actual periodic behaviors of the data stream. Moreover, there could be multiple and potentially overlapping periodic intervals encoded in the data stream. Extending the given approach to such a more general setting seems not trivial.\n\n2. More studies on why the random partition attention works are necessary. It's not clear to decide on the number of groups and how many instances are required for the ensemble during inference to get the best performance. Are there some metrics we can check before/during training to get the right number of groups? Furthermore, how do they relate? I.e., if we change the number of groups when partitioning, how should the number of instances in the ensemble be adjusted accordingly?"

                "value": "1. The effectiveness of the proposed two sparse attention modules in the model can be questionable. In the Method section (Section 3), I found that ESSformer is not a purely Transformer-based model because it includes an MLP encapsulating two attention modules at each layer of the model. Excluding these two structures, ESSformer appears to be a simplified version of TSMixer, which is already effective enough. The results of ablation experiments are also unsatisfactory, as the predictive performance of the ablated models closely resembles that of the non-ablated models. Additionally, in Table 1, we observe that the performance difference between ESSformer and TSMixer is not significant.  \n2. The reason why randomly partitioning features seems to work could be simply because it involves using a reduced set of features for prediction. The author's perspective is that R-PartA works by diversifying the training set by allowing partial feature interactions, and the model is capable of \"overcoming feature dropping\" (as discussed in Section 4.3). However, for time series forecasting tasks, the results of univariate time series predicted univariate time series are often superior to multivariate time series predicted univariate time series. Also, the more features are used, the more challenging the prediction becomes, leading to poorer model performance in terms of metrics, so there is no \"overcoming feature dropping\".  \n3. In the complexity section, the author does not compare all the experimentally selected baseline models in Table 1, including some Transformer-based models such as PatchTST. This omission is somewhat perplexing."

In this way, the complexity of self-attention is reduced while the random partitioning in features introduces implicit data augmentation to boost the performance."
