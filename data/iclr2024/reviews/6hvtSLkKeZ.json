In order to account for the fact that good solutions should cluster items in the same class, a decoding algorithm that prioritizes items clustered to existing open bin is proposed.

This is an original contribution that will help the research community to think differently. As the use of GNNs & heatmaps are common in other methods, innovations in this paper, such as cluster decoding would also easily transfer to other problems in the future work. \n\nQuality: Authors follow best practices in the literature. First, they use GNN to model the interaction between variables, which has become standard in neural combinatorial optimization algorithms. Then, they use heatmap for decoding, which is becoming standard for TSP and related problems. The choice of supervised pre-training is also very well-suited, because difficult problems with known ground-truth shall be easily generated. The proposed method also makes a good improvement over Pointer Network baseline.

As I am not an expert on bin packing and related problems, it is difficult for me to evaluate the significance of CCBPP. Also, other attendees of this conference may feel similarly. When authors present the paper, attendees wouldn't be interested in the talk unless they are convinced of the usefulness of CCBPP. While authors discuss CCBPP applications in Section 3, I would encourage authors to elaborate more on their significance in order to convince this conference's audience."

                "value": "In equation (8), wouldn't it numerically more tractable to optimize the log probability $\\sum_{i,j} \\hat{p}_{i,j}  \\cdot \\log p_{i,j}$, rather than sum of probabilities as in (8)? I understand this has nice interpretation as modularity, but often, probabilities are harder to optimize with gradient descent than log-probabilities, because sigmoid has near zero gradient for most of its domain.\n\nI was also not sure how Policy Gradient shall be applied on ClusterDecode. Authors say $p_\\theta$ in Policy Gradient equation (Section 4.3.2) correspond to Cluster Decode, but according to Appendix C, Cluster Decode is mostly deterministic algorithm (other than the choice of the first item). Hence, conditioned on the choice of the first item, the probability will be 1 for chosen item at the state, and 0 for not chosen items."
