A general probabilistic framework is proposed to interpret various existing OOD detection methods, providing insights for future research. Concurrently, a Self-Supervised Sampling for OOD Detection (SSOD) model is introduced, which leverages natural OOD signals from ID data through convolution\u2019s local property, allowing for the joint optimization of OOD detection and ID classification in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale benchmarks, significantly outperforming previous methods, and showing remarkable results on both standard and challenging OOD datasets."

                "value": "1. SSD [1] also uses a self-supervised algorithm for OOD detection; however, the article does not make any comparisons with SSD.\n2. As shown in Tables 2, 4, and 5, SSOD results in a decrease in the model's accuracy for ID classification, which is not permissible for OOD detection. OOD detection requires the model to identify OOD data without affecting the accuracy of ID classification.\n3. The results reported in Table 1 show that SSOD does not achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all OOD datasets, and there are many works with better performance not compared in Table 1: React [2], Dice [3], Ash [4].\n4. The motivation is not convincing enough: I do not agree with the author's critique of the two-stage manner approach. Post-processing algorithms are actually more suitable for adapting to various pre-trained models, regardless of whether the model is trained with supervised learning or self-supervised learning.\n5. Table three indicates that SSOD performs poorly on hard OOD detection tasks, does this highlight a flaw in the algorithm: its inability to differentiate between ID and OOD with similar backgrounds? Take the following more realistic example of OOD input: if a network trained to distinguish between different types of apples (e.g., fuji, red, honey-crisp, etc.) is presented with a different fruit as OOD data (e.g., peach, plum, tomato, etc.), the background features could be similar for both ID and OOD data. Alternatively, consider a scenario like scene classification (indoor scene vs beach scene vs forest scene, just as a hypothetical example). In this case, there is no background as such, because the entire scene constitutes the 'foreground.' I am very curious about how SSOD would perform in such scenarios.\n6. I recommend the author conduct experiments about ViT architectures.\n\n[1]  Sehwag, Vikash, Mung Chiang, and Prateek Mittal. \"Ssd: A unified framework for self-supervised outlier detection.\"\u00a0ICLR 2021.\n\n[2] Sun, Yiyou, Chuan Guo, and Yixuan Li. \"React: Out-of-distribution detection with rectified activations.\"\u00a0Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems\u00a034 (2021): 144-157.\n\n[3] Sun, Yiyou, and Yixuan Li. \"Dice: Leveraging sparsification for out-of-distribution detection.\"\u00a0European Conference on Computer Vision.

                "value": "Major Points:\n\n1. **Concerns about the First Contribution:**\n\na. The derivation in Eqs 1-6 appears not helpful to the proposed method and Eq. 7 could be introduced more directly with \n\n$$P(w_i|x)=P(w_i,x\\in S_{ID}|x) = P(w_i|x\\in S_{ID},x) \\cdot P(x\\in S_{ID}|x), i=1,\\dots,M$$\n\nb. The analysis of prior methods seems not necessarily dependent on a probabilistic perspective, since $P(x\\in S_{ID}|x)$ is essentially a rephrasing of existing methods (in A.1).\n\nThus, the emphasis on the probabilistic viewpoint might not be as novel as suggested.\n\n2. **Impact of Confidence Threshold:** How does the confidence threshold, $\\gamma$, in Eq. 9 influence the performance? Could the authors elaborate on how they determined its value during experiments?\n\n3. **Bias in the Proposed Method:** The paper indicates that existing post-hoc methods are influenced by biases from pretrained models. Yet, as Table 3 reveals, the proposed technique doesn't perform optimally on ImageNet-O, which contains adversarial images for ImageNet. Given that the method's training relies on both the original dataset and model's intermediate predictions, is it possible the method still suffers from the bias?\n\n4. **Effect of OOD Training Target on ID ACC:** In the experiments, what is the ID ACC performance when $\\alpha=0$? Essentially, does including the OOD training target lead to a noticeable decrease in ID ACC?\n\n5. **Fairness of Comparison in Experiments:** In the experimentation section, multiple methods such as MSP, ODIN, ReAct, and many others are post-hoc techniques that work off a fixed pre-trained model. These methods don't adjust the training process, distinguishing them from the proposed approach. As a result, juxtaposing these techniques might not offer a balanced comparison. The majority of experiments may not necessarily highlight the superiority of the proposed method. It would be beneficial for the authors to contrast their strategy with other training-based techniques.\n\nMinor Points:\n1. **Table Formatting Issues:** In Tables 4 & 5, the shaded regions seem to obscure the lines, affecting clarity.\n\n2. **Discussion Location:** In the introduction, the authors state that \"various OOD methods can be analyzed, with main differences and key limitations clearly identified\". However, this discussion is relegated to the appendix. It would be more helpful if the main content were self-contained and inclusive of this analysis."

In my opinion, if authors claim the probabilistic interpretation as an analysis tool, then it shouldn't be delegated to the supplementary.  \n\n**Motivation and intuition**\n- Authors show impressive results on several OOD benchmarks but the motivation that image background can serve as a good proxy for OOD data has some flaws.\n- First, using the penguin image example from Fig. 2, teaches the network to consider the background (in this case \"water\") as a signal for OOD. Now this will be ineffective in datasets constructed from comics or cartoons which is not one of the domains that authors evaluate their method on. This also explains why the scores are lower on OOD datasets constructed from SUN, Places because Imagenet is predominantly biased towards \"organisms\" and \"food\" with lower signals from indoor scenes and places. This raises the question \"Does this method work because of the choice of the OOD datasets used?\" This is partly explained by the results on \"Textures\" (I agree with the authors that textures has some overlap with patterns in the ID classes and the results are low, but I believe that is just part of the story). \n- Second, I think some additional analysis is required on the iNaturalist dataset (or maybe another toy setup on the subset of imagenet) which explains why the method works. If the OOD head is learning to detect any background patch as OOD, then what is the role of this in iNaturalist, where the background is usually water/trees/nature etc? From Imagenet, the network learnt to flag any background containing these regions as OOD, so does it ignore the ID category entirely and just focus on background? But that can't be true because the ID performance is also higher. The interplay between the CLS head and OOD head is very important to completely understand why image background is a good proxy and is missing from the paper. \n\n**I recommend authors to consider answering these questions for me to improve on my rating**\n\n[1] Liu, Yen-Cheng and Ma, Chih-Yao and He, Zijian and Kuo, Chia-Wen and Chen, Kan and Zhang, Peizhao and Wu, Bichen and Kira, Zsolt and Vajda, Peter, Unbiased Teacher for Semi-Supervised Object Detection, ICLR 2021."

Can you elaborate what they mean by this?\n- In eq. 9 the $y_i^{\\text{OOD}}$ is the label for detecting OOD patches right? In which case, patches with confidence lower than 5% ($1-\\gamma$) should have a label 1 and not 0 right?\n- In the 2nd sentence below Eq. 11, is it \"During inference\" or \"During training/inference\"? The second loss term in Eq. 11 is applied on a spatial map from what I understood, so why do we have to compute $P(x\\in \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathbb{ID}}|x)$ explicitly during training? We just need that during inference correct?"

This framework presents an insightful overview of existing OOD detection methodologies and pinpoints their limitations (classifiers and features are often biased towards ID data). To address this challenge, the authors introduce Self-Supervised Sampling for OOD Detection (SSOD), utilizing image backgrounds as effective proxies for OOD data. The model employs separate ID and OOD heads, with the OOD head being self-trained through the utilization of confidence scores derived from the classification head. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches by a substantial margin."

The authors identify two main challenges the existing methods are facing, namely the absence of a unified perspective to interpret existing techniques and the need for natural OOD supervision to enhance model robustness without the necessity of explicit OOD data collection. Towards this end, the authors introduce a novel probabilistic framework that provides a unified interpretation of many existing OOD detection methods and the SSOD model that efficiently leverages the CNNs properties (retain spatial information) to create a distinction between ID and OOD samples. The paper's contributions are substantiated through extensive experiments (both is terms of benchmarks, as well as proper evaluation w.r.t state-of-the-art methods). SSOD shows consistent improvements in OOD detection metrics over previous methods, highlighting the model's effectiveness in recognizing and handling OOD samples without the need for additional OOD data."
