                "value": "- Limited Contribution and Novelty. The contribution and novelty of this paper may be limited. The theorem presented in the paper, Theorem 1, appears to be a specific application of the Generalized Marginal Sensitivity Model (GMSM) introduced by Frauen et al. (2023), which offers a comprehensive framework for causal sensitivity analysis under unobserved confounding in various settings. It would be beneficial to clarify the distinct contributions and challenges of this work compared to Frauen et al. (2023).\n\n- Limited Scope in Fairness Notions. The paper is somewhat misleading in its claim to perform sensitivity analysis on causal fairness under unobserved confounding. In fact, the focus of this paper is confined to specific causality-based fairness notions based on counterfactual direct effect (Ctf-DE), indirect effect (Ctf-IE) and spurious effects. However, causal fairness encompasses a broader range of notions, such as ones based on proxy discrimination, path-specific causal effects, path-specific counterfactual effects (including natural direct or indirect causal effect), etc. Additionally, it is misunderstanding to call the definitions Ctf-DE, Ctf-IE and Ctf-SE in Zhang & Bareinboim (2018a) as \u2018path-specific causal effects\u2019, which differs from their formal definition [1], thus leading to confusion.\n\n- Incomplete Literature Review. The paper lacks a comprehensive review of prior literature on sensitivity analysis on causal effects to unobserved confounding, such as marginal sensitivity model. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a brief overview of sensitivity analysis models, including the GMSM, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n- Enhanced Experimental Analysis. In the experimental section, it would be advantageous to report and compare prediction performance across various models under different levels of confounding. This would provide a more robust assessment of the proposed method's performance.\n\n- Handling Continuous Variables. The paper assumes that the variables Z and M are discrete, yet many real-world variables are continuous. Therefore, it is essential to discuss how the proposed method can be extended to accommodate continuous variables.\n\n[1] Avin, Chen, Ilya Shpitser, and Judea Pearl. \"Identifiability of path-specific effects.\" (2005)."

In this case, we need to know the unobserved confounding strength in order to estimate or optimize the causal fairness. \n\nThe novelty is relatively low. The causal fairness and the partial identification bound under MSM/GMSM is extensively studied, the paper simply combined them. \n\nAuthors did not report accuracy measures in the paper, which should also be reported. I assume such fairness constraint would impact the prediction accuracy a lot. \n\nA natural criticism is the method is restricted to discrete features, while in practice, variables like crime history may be highly contextual (videos, images, text, ..) . Can authors discuss the difficulty in extending it to high dimensional features? \n\nCan authors explain more on \"Fairness bounds in non-identifiable settings\": why general non-identifiability in these papers does not encompass the unobserved confounding case? Nabi & Shpitser, 2018 also uses unobserved confounding as one of the examples. \n\nTypo: abstract, sources of unobserved confounding? \"ours is the first work to study causal fairness under observed confounding.\" miss-specification. \n\nWriting: Why repeat the contribution at the end of section 1. The research gap seems to repeat contribution again and such gap is already mentioned before."

If I understood it well, is the main technical innovation the use of Lemma 1 in the context of GMSM? Or is this even more closely related to the cited paper?\n \nI\u2019m confused by Eq. (11): there is an expectation over $Y$. Why is this form of aggregation sensible? I\u2019d expect that we would like to enforce the constraint uniformly over all possible values in the same sample space of $Y$ instead of  performing any sort of probabilistic averaging. Speaking of which, which distribution are we marginalizing over, is this the marginal distribution of $Y$? What happens to $a_i$, $a_j$ from (1)-(3)?\n \nMaybe this is well-explored in the causal fairness literature, but the switch between \u201creal Y\u201d and $f_\\theta$ in the training procedure in Section 5 is very confusing: we design $f$, so any confounding between \u201c$Y$ \u201c (that is, $f_\\theta$) vanishes by design. Why would we consider any sort of sensitivity parameter for \u201c$Y$\u201d?\n \nI\u2019m worried about the theoretical results. In Appendix D.3 the authors state that they \u201cextensively use the following corollary\u201d, which boils down to Eq. (33). This equation refers to \u201c$P(X |do(A=a), A\\neq a)$\u201d. The event past the conditioning bar has probability zero, as the control signal $do(A = a)$ implies $A = a$ (yes, we can condition on measure-zero events, that\u2019s what we do for continuous variables, but even then we take for granted the careful textbook measure-theoretical characterization of this conditional that we implicitly accept by default, but that\u2019s a non-trivial (and not unique!) characterization of conditioning. But  (33) doesn\u2019t appear to make sense even for discrete $A$). I may be missing something obvious, in which case I will appreciate a clarification \u2013 if this indeed \u201cfollows directly from basic probability theory\u201d I\u2019m happy to be taught the baby steps explicitly\u2026  Of course we can say that \n\n$$P(X | do(A = a)) = P(X(a)) = P(X(a) | A = a)P(A = a) + P(X(a) | A \\neq a)P(A \\neq a) = $$\n$$P(X | A = a)P(A = a) + P(X(a) | A \\neq a)P(A \\neq a) , $$\n\nbut $P(X(a) | A \\neq a)$ is not the same thing as $P(X | do(A = a), A \\neq a)$. Among other things, $X$ is not $X(a)$ when $A \\neq a$, but it is undefined what $X$ even means under regime $do(A = a)$ and event $A \\neq a$."
