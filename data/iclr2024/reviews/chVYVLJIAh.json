                "value": "1. While the paper is well-written overall, there are some technical details and notations that can make key formulas harder to parse (see the minor comments below). For a paper with relatively heavy notation, as it needs to consider ground-truth models, estimated models, transitions collected from interactions, and transitions from learned models, such mistakes, while understandable, can make some key concepts hard to grasp. As someone with little prior knowledge on MuZero and IterVAML, I found the mathematical details behind both losses hard to understand.\n2. The legends and labels in the figures are slightly confusing. The paper's text seems to use $\\lambda$-MuZero and $\\lambda$-IterVAML to refer to the variants of the two losses under the $\\lambda$-AC framework, and MuZero and IterVAML to refer to the \"vanilla\" versions of the algorithms. However, I cannot find $\\lambda$-MuZero nor $\\lambda$-IterVAML in figures 4 - 7, which seems to suggest that the experiments are done on the \"vanilla\" algorithms themselves. Is this the correct interpretation? \n \nMinor Comment\n1. I am slightly concerned by the correctness of eq (1) and eq (2) as written here. Particularly, eq (1) takes expectation over some $\\mu \u2208 \\Delta(S \u00d7 A)$ (even though here the paper lets $\\mu$ be a distribution over the state space only), whereas in eq (2) the samples follow a distribution where the initial state $x\\_{i\\_1}$ is drawn from some $\\mu \u2208 \\Delta(S)$, and actions $a$ and subsequent states are drawn from the ground-truth transition kernel $p$ (which generates $\\mathcal{D}$). Without any assumption on $\\mu$, I am not sure if (2) provides an unbiased estimate of (1). Note that the cited work (Farahmand, 2018) also seems to take expectation over some joint distribution over state and action.\n2. In Algorithm 1, $\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\rm Latent}$ is used instead of $\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\rm latent}$ and the notation is not consistent.\n3. In eq (4), is $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$ a typo? Should it be $\\hat{f}^j$ instead? If not, what is the relation ship between the two?\n4. Shouldn't the sample-based versions of MuZero and IterVAML depend on some policy $\\pi$ as well? Aren't the actions $a\\_{i\\_j}$ are collected by some particular policy $\\pi$?"

I am not familiar with either MuZero or IterVAML, so my assumption may be misguided. However, shouldn't it be expected that MuZero will always have some bias? From equation (3), my understanding is that the loss function uses some deterministic mapping to estimate the transition. As such, the assumption is inherently not compatible with stochastic transition. Is this intuition oversimplifying the problem? (Of course this is not to say the theoretical results are trivial or not interesting. Rigorous proofs cannot be replaced by hand-waving \"analysis\".)"

Specifically, it focuses on analyzing decision-aware model losses from two existing approaches, IterVAML and Muzero: it shows that IterVAML can learn a sound expectation (deterministic) model for stochastic environments under some conditions. At the same time, Muzero doesn\u2019t share this nice property. Empirical results of instantiations with the two losses on a difficult task validate this theoretical finding.

It shows that with a sufficiently flexible function class, IterVAML can recover an optimal deterministic model for value function prediction. And MuZero is a biased method such that it will not recover the correct value function in stochastic environments even if the correct model is used and the function class is Bellman complete. With theoretical analysis, it shows that MuZero is most susceptible to the noise among all three loss functions.
