The empirical\nresults show that the binary feedback channel provides an increase in\nperformance in the presence of such noise but is not necessary in the noiseless\ncases.  This effect is robust across different hyperparameters as well as with\nboth symbolic and image embedding-based observations."

                "value": "Methods: The most significant concern is that the apparent lack of compositionality (arguably the 'headline' result) is an artifact of the specific choice of how to inject noise (via random i.i.d. replacement with a special token). Modeling *misunderstanding*, uncertainty over *meaning* or *interpretation* at the message level, rather than uncertainty over the literal content of each message token, would better reflect the cases where repair arises in real-world communication. \n\nOriginality: While some details of the specific implementation here is novel, a number of prior works have also introduced interactive repair mechanisms into signaling games and are not discussed. Even the classic Steels (1995) simulations included a form of (binary) repair. Here are some salient examples from the more recent literature. \n\n- van Arkel, Woensdregt, Dingemanse, & Blokpoel.

Open-domain clarification question generation without question examples. EMNLP. \n\nAdditional weaknesses:\n\n* The feedback channel only allows binary signals. It's unclear how the results would be affected by a higher-dimensional space of feedback. \n* Noise is only added to sender messages, but realistically noise would affect receiver feedback too, possibly shrinking the gap between the feedback vs. no-feedback models.\n* No comparison to recent related work like van Arkel et al. is provided to situate the advances here.\n\nIn summary, while this work provides a good first investigation, the contributions are somewhat modest and incremental given prior exploration of feedback channels. It's difficult to know which aspects of the findings are general consequences of repair mechanisms, and which aspects are artifacts of specific choices about how noise is injected in this task setup. Addressing the above limitations would strengthen the novelty and significance of the study."
