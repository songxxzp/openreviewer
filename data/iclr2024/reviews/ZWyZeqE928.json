There are now many function decomposition models based on Tucker decomposition, e.g., [1,2], so the Introduction section regarding related works appears to be inaccurate.\n3. Furthermore, the significance of this paper isn't fully articulated. Merely stating that there is currently no function Tucker decomposition doesn't seem to provide a sufficiently compelling reason for its importance.\n4. Regarding the optimization algorithm, this paper is also closely related to some previous work, e.g., [3]\n[1] M.Imaizumi, K.Hayashi (2017). \"Tensor Decomposition with Smoothness\".

                "value": "1. What are the advantages of this function tensor decomposition method compared to existing approaches? Utilizing the Tucker decomposition allows for the representation of higher-order tensors and effectively mitigates the problem of the curse of dimensionality. Why does the Tucker decomposition lead to a more compact and flexible low-rank representation compared with TT and CP?\n2. What is the primary motivation behind this paper in comparison to other function CP, Tucker, and TT decompositions? If this method was established solely because GP-based functional Tucker decomposition does not currently exist, I believe the motivation appears to be rather weak.\n3. What is the primary innovation of this paper? Apart from considering continuous tensor indices in the modeling, is there a deeper level of differences compared to Bayesian Continuous Tucker Decomposition?"
