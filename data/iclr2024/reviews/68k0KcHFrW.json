                "value": "The paper introduces Stochastic UnRolled Federated learning (SURF), a novel approach that applies algorithm unrolling, a learning-based optimization paradigm, to the server-free federated learning scenario. The authors aim to leverage these benefits to address the challenges faced by low-end devices in collaborative deep model training. The paper identifies two main challenges in applying algorithm unrolling to federated learning: the necessity of feeding whole datasets to unrolled optimizers and the decentralized nature of federated learning. The authors propose solutions to these challenges by introducing stochastic mini-batches and a graph neural network (GNN)-based unrolled architecture, respectively. The stochastic mini-batches address the data feeding issue, while the GNN-based architecture preserves the decentralized nature of federated learning. The authors also provide theoretical proof of the convergence of their proposed unrolled optimizer and demonstrate its efficacy through numerical experiments."

                "value": "1. Originality: The paper introduces a novel approach. Algorithm unrolling is a learning-based optimization paradigm where iterative algorithms are unfolded into trainable neural networks, leading to faster convergence. Federated learning, on the other hand, is a distributed learning paradigm where multiple devices collaboratively train a global model. The originality of the paper lies in its integration of these two concepts, addressing specific challenges in server-free federated learning such as the need for whole datasets in unrolled optimizers and the decentralized nature of the learning process.\n\n2. Clarity: The paper is well-structured and presents its ideas in a clear and concise manner. \n\n3. Algorithm Simplicity and Neatness: Despite addressing complex challenges in federated learning, the algorithm proposed in the paper is simple and neat. The use of stochastic mini-batches and a GNN-based architecture provides a straightforward yet effective solution. The simplicity of the algorithm makes it accessible and easy to implement."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Vulnerability of Assumption 1: The paper assumes convexity in its problem formulation, which might not align with the real-world scenarios where deep learning models, predominantly used in Federated Learning (FL), are non-convex. This assumption is quite vulnerable as it oversimplifies the complexity of the learning models, potentially leading to over-optimistic results and conclusions. In practice, dealing with non-convex optimization problems is more challenging, and the algorithms need to be robust enough to handle such complexities.\n\n2. Practicality of Assumption 2: The assumption that  g=f and g=\u2223\u2223\u2207f\u2223\u2223 (f=\u2223\u2223\u2207f\u2223\u2223) is very rare to satisfy in real-world applications. These conditions impose strict requirements on the relationship.\n\n3. Local Minima and Convergence: In non-convex optimization problems, the paper should consider replacing the goal of reaching local minima with finding stationary points, which are points where the gradient is close to zero. This adjustment would provide a more accurate representation of the convergence behavior in non-convex settings, since two neural nets are involved.\n\n4. Heterogeneity of Local Models and Fair Comparison: The paper adopts the heterogeneity of local models and data distribution in federated learning settings. However, the comparison of SURF with FedAvg-type methods might not be entirely fair due to this heterogeneity. To address this issue, the paper should conduct more extensive experiments, comparing SURF with a broader range of personalized federated learning methods that are designed to handle heterogeneity more effectively. Some of the methods that could be considered for comparison:\n\npFedMe: Personalized Federated Learning with Moreau Envelopes Dinh et al., 2020\nPerFedAvg: Personalized Federated Learning with Theoretical Guarantees: A Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning Approach Fallah et al., 2020\nAPFL: Adaptive Personalized Federated Learning Deng et al., 2020\nDitto: Fair and Robust Federated Learning Through Personalization Li et al., 2022\nMobilizing Personalized Federated Learning in Infrastructure-Less and Heterogeneous Environments via Random Walk Stochastic ADMM\n, Parsons et al., 2023"
