                "value": "The paper explores the challenge of evaluating well-trained Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in real-world scenarios where test graph data lacks labels and may differ from the training data's distribution. To address this, the authors propose \"Learning Behavior Discrepancy\" (LEBED) as a score to assess a GNN's generalization ability under test-time distribution shifts. LEBED measures differences in learning behavior between a GNN trained on the training graph and one retrained on the test graph, considering both node prediction and structure reconstruction discrepancies. A novel GNN re-training strategy is introduced for this purpose. The paper's experiments demonstrate that the LEBED score strongly correlates with ground-truth test errors for various GNN models, offering an effective evaluation metric. The paper acknowledges certain assumptions and suggests addressing more complex distribution shifts in future research."

From my perspective, it is an important and practical concern in the field of graph neural networks. This is a significant contribution as it explores the evaluation of GNNs under real-world conditions with distribution shifts and the absence of test node labels. It also paves the way to pre-training large-scale GNN models.\n\n2.\tProposed Metric (LEBED): The paper introduces a novel metric, LEBED (Learning Behavior Discrepancy), which aims to estimate the generalization error of well-trained GNN models under distribution shifts. It re-trains the GNN under test data and then calculate the discrepancy of optimal weights between training and test data. Fig 2 gives a clear framework.\n\n3.\tExperimental Validation: The paper conducts extensive experiments on real-world test graphs under diverse distribution shifts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
