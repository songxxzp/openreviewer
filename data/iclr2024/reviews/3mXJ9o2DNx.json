                "value": "This paper addresses the challenge of distribution shifts between training and testing datasets in domain generalization (DG). Contrary to expectations, applying contrastive learning (CL) directly in DG settings leads to performance deterioration due to the lack of domain connectivity. To address this, the authors propose domain-connecting contrastive learning (DCCL), which introduces aggressive data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples to improve domain connectivity. They also propose model anchoring to exploit domain connectivity in pre-trained representations. Experimental results on standard DG benchmarks demonstrate that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, even without domain supervision."

The authors provide a clear and reasonable definition of domain connectivity, enhancing our understanding of this important aspect.\n3.

                "value": "1. One potential weakness of the paper is that it may overstate its claims regarding the theoretical analysis of why Contrastive Learning harms the performance of Domain Generalization models. The current version lacks rigorous theoretical analysis and relies more on heuristic motivation rather than providing concrete theoretical explanations.\n2. Although the paper proposes improving the similarity of representations across different domains as a key contribution, similar ideas have been previously proposed and utilized in the literature, such as in [1]. This could be seen as a limitation in terms of originality.\n3. The proposed Generative Transformation Loss for Pre-trained Representations raises concerns. The approach of fine-tuning the model to align $z$ and $z^{pre}$ appears counterintuitive, as it may reduce performance when using $z$ for prediction. This introduces a potential trade-off between the ERM loss and the Generative Transformation Loss for DCCL, which needs to be carefully considered.\n4. The paper fails to adequately explain the relationship between domain connectivity and the classification/regression performance, which is the ultimate goal of Domain Generalization. While domain connectivity is an important metric to consider, the authors do not sufficiently address how it directly impacts the predictive performance of the models in real-world scenarios.\n\n[1] Improving Out-of-Distribution Robustness via Selective Augmentation.

Please shed light on the rationale for model anchoring, particularly leveraging domain connectivity in pre-trained representations and its synergy with generative transformation loss.\n\nNotably, the model is constructed on the foundation of SWAD. When evaluated across five benchmarks, the performance improvements over SWAD are recorded as 1.0, 2.9, 3.7, 0.9, and 1.0 respectively. An ablation study assessing the effectiveness of the three components of the proposed method was specifically conducted on the benchmark with a 2.9 gain. Would it be possible to also conduct the ablation study on benchmarks that achieved a performance gain of 1.0 or less? My curiosity stems from questioning whether all three components consistently contribute to the effectiveness as presented in the paper."

I think both of them serve as regularization to constrain the representation space not far away from the pretrained representation space. From this perspective, generative transformation loss seems a little ad-hoc. \n- In appendix C, paragraphs are duplicated.

I can see that this is to exploit more information from the sample itself, but why it can make domain generalization better is unclear.\n\n- Overall, I find the proposed method a bit ad-hoc, as it combines multiple disconnected components to improve the final performance. Why these components can work coherently to benefit the domain generalization task is unclear and also poorly motivated. It is insufficient to simply state that some losses are for intra-sample level and some for inter-sample level.
