Is it assuming that this distance is not conditioned on the properties of the protein and the generated molecules?\n3. Biological Motivation Again: Why 2\u00c5 is an appropriate threshold? Is there any underlying biological insight? It is true that this threshold fits well on the Crossdocked2020 dataset, does it still hold for other datasets?\n4. Performance: The performance gain on most benchmarks seems to be marginal, e.g. validity, novelty, uniqueness, diversity, SA, QED, Lipinski, and bond distributions.\n5. Clarity: The authors mentioned Van der Waals force and Hydrogen Bonding in their abstract. Can their model better capture these interactions?"

This new process forces molecular coordinates to adhere to set physical constraints. Crucially, the proposed method doesn't require any changes to be made to the training process of GDMs. Empirical evaluations have shown that this method significantly reduces atomic clashes compared to the original LD process of GDMs."

PoseCheck (Harris et al23) consider a threshold of .5A, which sounds more reasonable.\n- There is not much detail in how clash is computed. Since the main contribution of the paper is to reduce the number of clashes, it could be nice to have more details about this metric, how the numbers would change if you change the definition of clash used, etc.\n- The choice of evaluation metrics made by the authors are not the best. I am really confused why on Table 1, they show Hoogeboom et al 22 metrics (a model that deals with unconditional generation). These metrics are far from the best. You can think of at least using the metrics proposed by MiDi (Vegnac et al23). But since this is pocket-conditional generation task, we are also interested in how to do the generated ligand bind to the pocket and how stable it is (eg metrics related to docking score, strain energies, protein-ligand interactions, etc).
