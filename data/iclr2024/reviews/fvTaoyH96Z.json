                "value": "* The paper is extremely challenging to read with many terms not being properly defined and phrasings being too vague to grasp. I will provide more details in the 'Questions' section, but on a high level, it's actually hard to understand what the author's method proposes. The authors have some context in mind which a reader (at least me) does not have, and even after several passes, I'm not sure what some of the paragraph are about.\n* The paper oversells too much. As I mentioned, formalising generalisation in RL is hard, and I appreciate the authors undertook this challenge. The authors motivate their work with practical applications, posing it as an extremely general 'environmental generalisation' problem. However, the further we go into the paper, the more assumptions are being made: action space should be shared, MDPs are goal-conditioned, (2) poses some Lipschitz-like assumptions on the policies. It is fine to introduce the assumptions and reduce the scope of the work, but I don't think the Introduction is preparing us for that.\n* The paper misses important bits of related work.\n  *Firstly, I don't think the paper treats related work fairly:\n    * \"To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce a structured framework that uniformly describe the environmental generalization problem.\"\n    * \"As there are no works that have solved environmental generalization tasks...\"\n\" ... we propose a novel framework that tries to describe and solve the generalization RL tasks that have intrinsic environental change. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to discuss and attempt to deal with this problem\"\n  * I don't think all the above is true, given the paper definition of environmental generalisation: \"RL agents frequently need to adapt to diverse environmental conditions, necessitating policy adaptations to changes in state space, action space, and transition functions. This requirement, termed \u201denvironmental generalization\u201d in RL\".\n  * \"A Survey of Zero-shot Generalisation in Deep Reinforcement Learning\" by Kirk et al not only provides a framework for generalisation in RL, but provides a great overview of the topic.\n  * From what I understood, the paper reinvented ProcGen (see \"Leveraging Procedural Generation to Benchmark Reinforcement Learning\" by Cobbe), which is not mentioned in the paper at all.\n  * Other useful references from older research to develop authors' ideas:\n    * \"Autonomous shaping: knowledge transfer in reinforcement learning\" by Konidaris and Barto. The paper proposes splitting the representation into two parts: agent space and problem space. The first never changes when doing transfer, the other does. This might be relevant to paper's attempt of understanding invariants when generalising.\n    * \"An Object-oriented representation for efficient Reinforcement Learning\" by Diuk, Cohen and Littman. I brought up this paper as the authors reason about semantics of the tasks and varying objects in the environments that are not necessarily useful for completing the task's goal. \"Generalizing Plans to New Environments in Relational MDPs\" by Guestrin et al is in the similar vein.\n    * \"Transient non-stationarity and generalisation in deep reinforcement learning\" by Igl et al might be interesting from the perspective of catastrophic forgetting and neurons saturation when generalising."

                "value": "* Could you, please, narrow down the definition of the 'environmental generalisation' in the paper. The second paragraph in the intro gives a quite general definition, but I have a feeling that the rest of the paper means something else by it. You mention 'intrinsically different' several times, could you, also, provide a definition?\n* Could you define 'task-agnostic components'? Could you, please, give an example?\n* What do you mean by the following? \"Different from previous methods, our work intrinsically randomizes the enviroonment to build task-level augmentations and does not require a specific parameterized model\". Do I understand it correctly, that for your method, you need to have access to the objects in the environmental scene? In your opinion, why is this different from varying the parameter vector of the environment (e.g. friction coefficient in MuJoCo).\n* Your MDP definition implies that MDP is induced by I, but none of the MDP tuple components depend on it. Could you give more intuition about this parameter? What is this exactly? Could you give an example? Later you mention that \"I stays invariable and represents the common points of the same task in different environments.\" Is this an additional assumption on your method/framework that tasks should have some 'common points'? What are these common points? What is the distinction between an MDP, a task and an environment in your context? Related to that, could you provide more intuition on equation (1)? Could you give an example of the reversible function in addition to the 'task-agnostic background'? What is a background of task?\n* In your definition of an MDP, discount factors are shared. Do you think this is a realistic assumption? If you are motivated by the practical applications as stated in the intro, could you elaborate on the consequences of this assumption?\n* Assumption 3.2 mentiones 'well-learned policies', are those optimal policies? Have you checked if the assumption in 3.2 holds in your empirical experiments?\n* At the bottom of page 6, you give an example of a robot that should find an apple. You say that you can randomize all the objects non-related to the task (fridge, microwave, room structure), add some unrelated objects etc. Is this another assumption of your method? Consider, all these objects' attributes are in a vector that we can randomise, how is this different from domain randomisation? Can we call this a nonparameterised randomisation? Moreover, you mention that you might want to modify the position of the apple, why is this task-agnostic if the task is to find an apple? \n* Could you explain the following sentence?  \"Because compared with fixed environments, the unacceptable large variance in the dynamic learning process will disturb the gradient convergence direction\". What variance do you have in mind here?"

Both of these conditions are difficult to fulfill in practice, and thus the method has significant limitations.\n2) The method is designed to utilize the two preconditions mentioned above, whereas the other algorithms in the experiment were designed without them. Therefore, I think that the generalization capability experiment in the paper is meaningless. It is unfair to the other algorithms to conduct comparison experiments under different experimental conditions.\n3) \u201cIn complex generalization tasks, the common part is embedded in the environment and is not always observable.\u201d So is it the similarity parts or the changing background of the model definition?

In fact, many recent works, such as RT-2 (Google, 2023), have shown that with increased diversity of backgrounds, zero-shot generalization can be obtained in unseen environments. Is there more nuance here that is not coming across?\n- The paper makes it seem like the NPR method removes significant assumptions for training, but in practice, randomizing the non-parametrized task-agnostic parts of the environment may be even more difficult than the task-relevant parts of the environment. This is something that would not be very scalable in many real world applications. \n- The comparisons in the empirical evaluation all use fewer assumptions than NPR--they do not assume access to randomizing specific aspects of the environments."
