            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the paper combines existing ideas to address the challenges of online GP regression with uncertain inputs, there are significant weaknesses in how the results are presented and evaluated:\n\n## Originality\nThe paper relies on existing ideas for low-rank Gaussian processes (Solin & S\u00e4rkk\u00e4, 2020) for scalability and builds on approaches on how to incorporate noisy data via a Taylor approximation. At times it is difficult to separate what this paper adds from what is known. In particular, how the Taylor approximation differs from the one considered by Bijl et al, 2017. The fact that GPs can be updated in an online fashion through (tractable) sequential conditioning is also well known (e.g. via updating a Cholesky factorization). \n\n## Method and Theoretical Results\nThe method is explained in a lengthy fashion but at crucial points leaves out details. For example, as above, what is new about the use of the Taylor approximation? Also how do the update equations (20) - (23) arise? Are these just based on the standard sequential view of GP inference? If yes, why is that a novel contribution? If no, how are they motivated / derived?\nThe online formulation of the noisy-input GP is the main contribution, so this seems like a crucial point.\n\n## Experimental Evaluation\nThe experimental evaluation is unfortunately very limited. In only compares to other online approaches on a synthetic dataset using an RBF kernel. There is no consideration of how to choose the rank of the approximation or how to optimize hyperparameters.  It was also unclear to me whether the baselines were also implemented in C++ as the author's approach or in Matlab, which potentially can lead to significant runtime differences.\n\n### Simulated Data\nFor the simulated data a more thorough comparison on different kernels in my opinion is necessary, in particular because low-rank approximation will work especially well on the chosen exponential kernel due to its fast decaying spectrum. While results in Table 1 seem to be promising, the differences in performance are within one standard deviation, making it hard to judge whether they are systematic or an artefact. Also there is no systematic variation of hyperparameters: It is unclear how the choices of \"other hyperparameters\" were made.\n\n### Magnetic Map Creation\nThe only other experiment, the magnetic map creation problem, does not compare RRONIG to another noisy-input method as far as I can tell, which I do not understand. This does not seem an informative comparison to me. If the reduced-rank approach for noisy-inputs is the main contribution, it would seem a comparison to SONIG is required here, no matter its robustness. In fact, if SONIG turns out to be non-robust on real data that would seem to be a benefit of RRONIG to be showcased. Further, error bars in Table 3 are missing, making it impossible to judge how large the performance difference is across different runs.\n\n### Suggested experiments\nTo improve the paper I would recommend some systematic ablation experiments on (synthetic) data. For example, choosing Matern kernels of increasing smoothness to judge the effectiveness of a low-rank approximation and the required rank for good performance. An experiment to evaluate the impact of the choice of rank or a strategy to choose the rank. Finally, an ablation that considers model mismatch, i.e. how RRONIG performs under slightly misspecified hyperparameters, which will be relevant in practice, since as far as i can tell no model selection strategy is presented.\n\n## Quality of Presentation / Clarity\nThe quality of presentation and clarity of the paper could be much improved. There is a lot of atypical language usage which makes the paper hard to understand in parts and can lead to confusion with existing mathematical terminology.\n\nExamples:\n- \"modelize\" => model\n- \"measure\" (measurement?) versus (probability) measure \n- the \"measure is ignored\" => measurement is ignored?\n- \"truth function\" => true / latent function \n- \"conditionned to\" => conditioned \n\nFurther, the paper could be simplified to make space for better visual illustrations of the results and the above ablation experiments. For example eqn 4 and 23 give the identical formula of the exponentiated quadratic kernel, which is well-known.\n\n## Minor Comments Not Affecting Score\n- Paper uses the ICLR 2023 template, not the 2024 template.\n- Code comments still state this paper is being submitted to NeurIPS 2023."

There is no explanation or derivation for them as far as I can tell.\n- How do you choose the number of eigenfunctions for the low-rank approximation? Is there an automatic way or is it fixed by hand?\n- How do you estimate kernel hyperparameters with your method? In the synthetic experiments you seem to use NIGP to do so.\n- What do you mean by \"more complete version of the Taylor approximation\" compared to Bijl et al. (2017)? What are the exact differences to the approach by Bijl et al (2017)?\n- Why are you only comparing your (online) noisy input approach to approaches which are not designed for noisy inputs (such as SONIG) on the magnetic map creation dataset?"

Second-order Taylor approximation and smooth basis functions are two tools that have been used already in this context. In other words, I have the feeling that the paper considers the approach of [3] with second-order approximation and usual basis function approximations. Am I right? I am not saying that the contribution is low because of this. However, I think this should be somehow emphasized. \n   -  One of the main weakness of the paper is the explanation around equations (18)-(22). This is not straightforward to go from equations in Section 4.1 to Section 4.2. This would have deserved more explanations. Could the authors provide some more in-depth details about equations  (18)-(22) and their links with equations from Section 4.1?\n   - If I have not missed it, the paper makes no mention of hyperparameter optimization. This is a challenging a question in an online context. How would the authors incorporate this crucial step in their current approach? \n   - It would have been interesting to see some results on different simulated benchmarks datasets (heteroscedastic noise variance for instance)\n\n\n[1] TD Bui, C Nguyen, RE Turner, Streaming Sparse Gaussian Process Approximations.

To numerical instabilities? From the experimental section, it seemed that the robustness is related to better numerical stability, but this should be more clear from the beginning of the paper.\n\n- In Section 2, the title \"Modifying GP equations\" is too generic. Almost all contributions in the GP literature require changing standard GP equations. Maybe \"Input noise modeling\" is enough?\n\n- Table 1 should include the log predictive density to better evaluate the models' predicted uncertainties.\n\n- Instead of reporting the average of the predicted variances and the \"mean ratio\", it would be more direct to simply report the mean log predictive density, which already balances the quality of the predicted means and variances.\n\n- Page 7: \"The variance represents the amplitude of the errors of the model that should be expected: it should be equal to the mean error.\" - Since the variance is in squared units, is the reported error also squared?\n\n- The \"reduced-rank GP\" competitor considered in the SLAM experiment is the one from Solin et al. (2015)? In the Conclusion, it is claimed \"an improvement over the state of the art on this context\". Was the proposal by Solin et al. (2015) the state of the art so far for SLAM problems?
