                "value": "The paper addresses the problem of combining multiple partial system rankings (from multiple evaluation tasks/instances) to form a single complete ranking. The proposed method consists in building fractional ranking matrices where missing evaluation are replaced by the proportion of permutations compatible with the partial information, and then combining those matrices with the consensus-oriented Borda aggregation method (sum of ranks). The method is adapted to both instance- and task-level aggregations and a O(n\u00b3) algorithm is proposed for counting the number of system orderings compatible with a partial rank. Synthetic results on a set of 20 systems, 20 tasks, 20 instances show the potential of the method against a baseline that averages metrics, ignoring missing values. Then, a large set of instance-level and task-level scores is produced and made available for popular benchmarks. Evaluation on this set confirms synthetic data results, however, as noted by the authors, the final rankings produced by Borda aggregation are very different from the mean ranking."

Thus, from figure 2 it's not clear whether its worse results are caused by one or the other, or, in other words, whether the proposed method is better because it uses ranks (instead of scores) or because it models missing scores.
