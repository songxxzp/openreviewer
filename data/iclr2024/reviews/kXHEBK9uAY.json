However, compared to HDMI, this paper has conducted extensive experiments on generalization and provided corresponding theoretical support. One suggestion I have is that the authors can emphasize the advantages of Hierarchical Diffuser from the perspective of generalization, and highlight the algorithm's generalization performance in the experimental design.\n- In the hierarchical framework, the quality of the generated high-level goals is crucial to the effectiveness of the algorithm. The authors emphasize that the Hierarchical Diffuser is simpler compared to existing hierarchical methods but have only designed one goal selection method. In addition to the fixed time interval heuristic method used in this paper, HDMI also mentions two heuristic methods based on spatial intervals and reward scale, which are equally simple and have low implementation costs. If the authors could take these heuristic methods into consideration, I believe it would have a positive impact on the completeness of the paper's content. Furthermore, the demonstration of the quality of the generated goals is essential, and there is a gap in this aspect in the current paper."

Although this two-step process makes sense, the overall training process becomes ad hoc and less general. Is there any connection between the upper and lower layers of Hierarchical Diffuser's planner? Can it be trained end-to-end?"

One diffuser plans for sub-goals between the start and the goal state. For each sub-goal segment, the second diffuser plans the optimal state-action sequence. Experiments are conducted on Maze, AntMaze, MuJoCo Gym and FrankKitchen benchmarks. The performance of HD is compared with relevant offline RL and hierarchical RL algorithms. Further, the experiments show improved receptibility, OOD generalization and less computation overhead as compared to diffuser. Relevant ablations are performed."

The authors validate this by showing that increasing the kernel-size (hence the receptive field) of diffuser leads to better performance but weaker generalization.\n\nSD with dense actions leads to better fitting of the sparse objective, a typical bottleneck in hierarchical RL.\n\nHD takes lesser time than Diffuser due to shorter high-level sequence and parallelly solving low-level plans for all the segments."

If you are following diffuser\u2019s codebase, are you using the diffusion sampled actions or a separate controller for Maze2d tasks like diffuser?\n\nSolving for sub-goals independently without the knowledge about the final goal might lead to non-optimal behavior. How do you ensure that the sampled path for one segment does not overlap with the paths for the other segment? How many trajectories do you sample for individual segments and for the sub-goal sequence?\n\nAlso, what happens when actions do not lead to the exact sub-goal (unless you use inverse dynamics actions) for the maze case? Because there is no-feedback from the low-level diffuser to high-level diffuser, it might become challenging.\n\nOverall, I acknowledge that the presented method is a promising revision of Diffuser which performs better in all aspects.
