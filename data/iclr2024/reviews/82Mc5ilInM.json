From my perspective, some of the motivations regarding model designs need further verification or validation.**\n  \nIn Section 1, the authors argued that RW, TPP, and ODE are computationally expensive. However, the proposed method includes a sampling procedure that samples $L$ first-hop historical neighbors for both source and target nodes. It seems that such a sampling procedure has a complexity similar to those of conventional methods (e.g., RW-based and PPT-based), according to my background knowledge. To verify this motivation, is is recommended to add the comparison of time complexity for sampling/feature extraction in both training and testing phases.\n  \nIt is also suggested to add pseudocode of each procedure (e.g., first-hop historical neighbors sampling, FFT, extraction of node interaction frequency, etc.) even in the appendix since the details of some modules in current version of manuscript are still unclear.\n  \nMoreover, the authors claimed that self-attention acts as persistent low-pass filter and the utilization of DFT can tackle its limitation. How this superiority of the proposed method is validated in the experiments?\n\n***\n\n**W2. As stated in Section 2, the authors only considered CTDG with edge addition events.

It is unclear that the inductive setting in this study refers to which case?\n  \n  According to my understanding, the inductive inference of the proposed method and other baselines relies on the availability of graph attributes (i.e., node and edge attributes in this study). Consider an extreme case, when attributes are unavailable, can the proposed method still support the inductive temporal link prediction?\n  \n  In addition to the commonly used settings of temporal link prediction in this study (i.e., the prediction of unweighted feature links), there are some other studies considered the advanced temporal link prediction tasks for weighted dynamic graphs [1-4], which should not only determine the existence of a future link but also the corresponding edge weight.
