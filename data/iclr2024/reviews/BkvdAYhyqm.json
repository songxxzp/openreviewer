                "value": "This paper introduces Summarize and Score (SASC), a method which generates natural language descriptions of text models, where a text model is any function that takes in text and outputs a scalar. This method does not require the model to be differentiable, and can operate by accessing paired input/outputs of the model.\n\nI've read both the main paper and the supplemental. Their proposed model consists of three steps:\n1. The probe step. Where they score natural language phrases taken from dataset. \n2. The summary step. They take a random subset of the top-scoring phrases, and provide them to a language model. The language model is prompted to provide multiple explanation of what activates a language model.\n2. The scoring step. When they prompt a language model to generate phrases related and unrelated to the explanation. An average of the difference is computed after proving the generate phrases to the original probed model, which is used to rank the proposed explainations.\n\nThey evaluate their proposed method in a couple of ways:\n1. Using the INSTRUCTOR-XL text embedding models, with a prompt for the model to cluster. Followed by negative euclidean distance.\n2. Using BERT combined with non-negative factorized dictionary coefficients.\n3. For fMRI voxels on a passive listening task, on \"The Moth\" among other works."

By evaluating on embedding models, you have a ground truth target to evaluate against. Assuming the embedding model is accurate, which is not an unreasonable assumption. \n2. By interpreting BERT transformer factors against previous human evaluations -- this is a direct comparison against a human baseline.\n3. By looking at fMRI data, this evaluates SASC on a noisy scenario where the various brain regions are can only be observed under a noisy setting. \n\nThe assumptions used in the paper are weak and reasonable, and do not require differentiability assumptions, a residual/skip connection assumption (for example in the logit lens paper). Compared to \"Language models can explain neurons in language models\" paper from OpenAI, their approach of using a corpus rather than per-token scoring is more sound, and it allows for more context dependent explanations.\n\nGiven that interpretability is a significant issue in the use of large language models, this paper addresses a timely and important problem."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I have a couple of concerns on the evaluation done in this paper.\n\n1. I think their corpus + score approach is more sound than the OpenAI's approach of token-wise scoring. But there is one problem I would like to see resolved:\n\n   a. There is no ablation study on the corpus size and the effect on explanation scores. Ideally the authors could explore the outcome using for example 10k, 20k, 40k, 80k, .... all n-grams.\n\n2. The scoring step in my view is suspect, and introduces an unnecessary confound in terms of their procedures. It seems very wrong to evaluate $E(f(\\text{Text}^{+})-f(\\text{Text}^{-}))$. In this case, you are asking the language model to generate the phrases unrelated to an explanation, so the final score is not just related to how good the positives are, but also how \"good\" the negatives are. Perhaps a more correct step should be $E(f(\\text{Text}^{+})-f(\\text{Text}^{\\text{all}}))$. This is less problematic if this was just used as an internal component, but I think it is problematic when the authors use it as a point of comparison in Table 4, Figure 3, Table 6, fMRI experiments, Table A4, and Table A8. \n\n3. The \"Default\" setting in \"synthetic modules\" experiment is not very sound in my view. Ideally the exploration of the 54 modules should not be relying on a corpus which is known to contain the relevant ngrams, but the exploration of the modules should use the same (random) selection of ngrams. \n\n4. It is a bit questionable that the authors use manual inspection to evaluate their method. Scanning both the main text and the supplemental, the authors do not use Amazon Mechanical Turk or Prolific, and do not include any details on this human study. I can only assume that this experiment was done by the authors themselves, which is prone to bias. A more accurate approach would be to take a different text embedding model (for example bge-large, other models are fine too), compute the n-way cosine similarities among the 54 models to the 54 explainations, and compute the argmax agreement (is the n-th explanation generated by the SASC cosine similarity maximized by the n-th model), or even the cosine distance when n-way classification is not appropriate. \n\n5. The clarity in some specific methods are poor. There is no details in either the main text or the supplemental. Concretely, I was unable to find details for the following:\n\n    a. ngram summarization baseline used in Table 1. I looked at the references provided by the author (Kadar et al. and Na et al.), neither are actually performing ngram summarization. The first citation uses a omission based approach, while the second uses a parsing + text replication approach.\n\n   b . Can the authors describe how they get the spearman rank correlation sem? I would not otherwise ask if the effect is strong, but the correlation is very low. Do the authors find the sem via a bootstrap? Could the authors report a t-statistic instead? \n\n6. It seems like this proposed method would only work on semantic selectivity, and it is unclear if this method can work on low-level text patterns. This is okay, but the authors should more clearly discuss this limitation in their paper.\n\nOverall I like the paper. And the proposed method is well described, but the author's evaluation broadly does not strike me as sound. I would happily re-evaluate if the authors can answer my questions."

What is the criteria to decide if an explanation is correct or not?\n2. It would be great if the authors could give some hints in scenarios where the proposed SASC algorithm does not have satisfactory results. Whether the reason is due to the limitation of the ngrams or the limitations of the helper LLMs.\n3. It would be great if the authors could clarify in more detail what does \u2018transformer factors\u2019 mean for BERT in Section 4. Additionally, what are the ground truth for these transformer factors? How is the SASC win percentage: 61% calculated?\n4. What GPT-3 is used as the helper LLM, rather than a more advanced model, such as GPT-3.5?\n5. Another interesting finding in Figure 3 is that, as the BERT layer increases, the explanation score tends to decrease. Could the authors give some hints on why this happens?"
