This bias originates from the inherent randomness associated with data augmentation and masking techniques. To mitigate this issue, they present an innovative strategy. This approach centers on minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between a model's representations of synthetic examples and the corresponding learnable target feature representations, effectively removing the randomness from the gradient computation.\nIn terms of computational efficiency, the authors propose a streamlined methodology that leverages a fixed feature extractor. They focus their optimization efforts on a linear head atop this stable feature extractor, resulting in substantial reductions in computational overhead. Importantly, this linear head optimization is thoughtfully formulated to yield a closed-form solution, employing kernel ridge regression for practical implementation.\nThe practical utility and impact of the proposed method are rigorously validated through empirical assessments spanning various applications, particularly those involving transfer learning. The experimental results are promising and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution."

Data augmentation is a central component in many SSL methods including Barlow Twins, which the authors use.\n- Unrelated to data augmentation, I feel it would be necessary to run the algorithm on a less small-scale setup, e.g. on 224x224 ImageNet, and on larger downstream models (ResNet18 or similar) to make a convincing case, in particular given the complexity of the algorithm. I know this requires some compute, but one such experiment would still be necessary in my opinion.\n- Some baselines might be weak; for example MobileNet and ResNet10 from scratch get < 4% accuracy on Cars.\n\nMinor comments:\n- The abstract might be hard to follow for readers unfamiliar with prior works on dataset distillation."
