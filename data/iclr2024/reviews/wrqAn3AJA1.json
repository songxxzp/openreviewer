HELP operates by continuously pooling nodes with similar embeddings in the graph, merging these embeddings through average pooling in a hierarchical manner across various levels by k-means. This method allows HELP to identify and elucidate concepts in the input graph pertinent to the model's predictions, with these concepts evolving and increasing in complexity at higher pooling levels. Moreover, this paper designs a new metric Concept Conformity to measure the quality of a concept which is demonstrated better than existing metric in three aspects. Experimental results indicate that HELP matches the performance of leading GNNs while uncovering concepts that are more consistent and in alignment with domain knowledge."

Similarly, the description of Algorithm 1 is limited and readers might be confused about the purpose of each step in this algorithm (e.g., What is CONCOMP and why should we use it in this method?).\n3. Though focusing on explainability, the experiment result shows that HELP doesn\u2019t outperform other approaches in model accuracy, so the quality of this method in practice is questioned. The author needs to give more persuasive experiment results to show the feasibility of HELP.\n4. The metric concept conformity is not applicable for all methods, e.g., ASAP generates NA for this metric. This means that the applicability of concept conformity requires further exploration.\n5.

This paper states that \u201cour techniques preserve sparsity\u201d in \u201cpaper\u2019s contribution\u201d,  but there is none of any further explanation about this point.
