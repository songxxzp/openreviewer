Traditionally, most methods infer noise transitions based on assumptions about similarities across different instances. However, these assumptions often lack empirical backing and may not accurately reflect real-world data scenarios, leading to incorrect interpretations of both noise transitions and clean labels.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, the authors propose a novel approach that models the generative process of noisy data instead of relying on predefined similarity assumptions. This method uses a learnable graphical model to represent the causal generative process behind the noise in data. By doing this, the model can more effectively identify the underlying causal factors that lead to noise in labels."

Various studies have explored this concept, leveraging the capacity of DGMs to model complex data distributions and underlying noise patterns, including [1].\n\n[1] Noisy Prediction Calibration via Generative Model, ICML2022\n\nFrom a critical standpoint, this study distinguishes itself from the ICML 2022 paper \"[1]\" by proposing a graphical model that requires the generation of input instances. A significant advantage of the approach in \"[1]\" is that it does not require input generation. Generating high-resolution instances can be inherently challenging or demand computationally intensive models like diffusion models, making the combination of input instance generation with noisy label classification potentially impractical.\n\nThe primary focus of this study on low-resolution datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10 in their experimental evaluations is possibly due to these inherent difficulties. Although they report results for the higher-resolution Clothing1M dataset, the lack of specific mention of standard deviations casts doubt on the reliability of these findings. Furthermore, the performance improvement over DivideMix is marginal, raising questions about the necessity of employing a deep generative model for noisy label classification. This aspect warrants skepticism regarding the scalability and practical applicability of the proposed method, especially for higher-resolution, real-world datasets.\n\nIncorporating a deep generative model in scenarios primarily focused on classification tasks can introduce a significant computational burden. The author should compare the increased computational requirements of this additional modeling with existing baselines to provide a clearer perspective on its practical feasibility. This comparison is crucial for assessing the trade-offs between the potential benefits of improved noise handling and the increased computational demands, particularly for applications where resources are limited or efficiency is a critical factor."

Using a simply trained network initially does not necessarily constitute distillation, which typically involves transferring knowledge from a more complex model.\n\nQ2. The authors should specify how their use of a DGM framework with causal graphs and inference differs in motivation and application from the work done in CausalNL, detailing the distinct aspects of their approach.\n\nQ3. In the context of noisy label classification, it's not typical to specifically categorize noise types as \"Worst,\" \"Aggregate,\" \"Random 1,\" \"Random 2,\" and \"Random 3\" without clear definitions. These terms are not standard in the literature and require clarification for proper understanding.\n\nQ4.

The paper should provide a comprehensive discussion for these baselines.\n\n* Additionally, there is a lack of discussion regarding related work on label-noise learning. While they use the clean example distillation method via the small-loss trick, it is essential to also survey this related work, such as sample selection methods, for a more comprehensive view of the field.\n\n[1] Yao, Y., Liu, T., Gong, M., Han, B., Niu, G., & Zhang, K.

Lack of Experimental Support\n\n* Some results, such as those for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10N, do not appear to be statistically significant, and the performance gain observed for Clothing1M is marginal. To further support the effectiveness of the proposed model, it would be beneficial to include experiments on various real-world datasets such as WebVision, ANIMAL-10N, and Mini-Imagenet, or to conduct repeated experiments on Clothing-1M.\n\n* The paper primarily presents the classification performance without conducting an in-depth analysis of the contributing factors behind the performance improvements. A more detailed examination of specific elements that have positively influenced the overall performance is needed. This could include: 1) an ablation study comparing model training with only $L_{semi}$ and with the entire loss, 2) a sensitivity analysis regarding hyperparameters (e.g., $\\lambda_{ELBO}$ and $\\lambda_M$), 3) a comparison between end-to-end learning and alternative learning approaches, and 4) an ablation study based on the number of latent variables, among other potential analyses.\n\n3. Minor Comments\n\n* The first paragraph of Section 3 and the first paragraph of 'Intuition about Inferring Latent Generative Process' have significant overlap. Rephrasing these sentences would improve clarity and avoid redundancy.\n\n* It would be helpful to include a citation when introducing the \"small-loss trick\" to provide proper credit and context.\n\n* Some numbering in the 'Baselines' section appears to be missing (e.g., 5 and 11)."
