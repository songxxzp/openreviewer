Firstly, maybe I am wrong, but I do not think such definition of using brackets $( )$ are mathematically meaningful. Is it to define a set, if so it should use { }.  Secondly, ${1\\leq i \\leq T}$ defines a continuous variable from 1 to T not a discrete one.\n  - Section 3.2, page 5 second paragraph, according to the context, a physics-aware neural network is trained to mimic the penetration depth metric (PD). After it is trained, how is it used? I believe it has been used to train the second stage, right? The same for section 3.3.\n  - It seems all the inline references used in the paper are not in parenthesis. I believe the authors miss used \\citet when there should be \\citep.\n\n- I am not convinced by the setup of the task. From my understanding, it only refines the hand pose regardless of the object pose. However, the object poses produced by the RGB based methods such as the one used in this paper (Hasson et al. (2020)), are also very noisy. The two proposed losses highly rely on the object poses. Will the noisy object pose affects the final results?\n    - Given a noisy hand motion, should the denoising process be deterministic especially when the noise level is high?\n\n- In tuitively, it is hard to understand the proposed losses especially for the manipulation expense metric (page 6).\n\n- As to the experiments, it would be better to also evaluate on other real-world datasets like DexYCB with more recent hand-object pose estimation pipelines to predict the inital hand-object poses."

The problem is inherently hard given its discrete nature. This is mentioned in the introduction in the sentence reading \"due to the intricate and\nnon-differentiable process of verifying the plausibility of hand motions\". Taking this argument one step further, one can argue that it's the discrete nature of the hand-object interaction (contact vs non-contact) that imposes the difficulty on the verification process. This is also the reason others have relaxed the problem by considering small proximity fields near the contacts and similar relaxation strategies.\n\nFurther strong points include the generalization obtained across datasets and the wide applicability of the tackled problem."

                "value": "Despite being rather well written overall, there are some points that in my opinion are hard to follow, and would benefit from a restructuring/rewriting. Specifically, in my opinion the whole paragraph describing the intermediate representation should be restructured for readability, in its current state it is hard to follow. I realize that this mostly describes the implicit field representation by Zhou et al, but it would still be beneficial for this work to adequately describe it since it forms a core part of the employed representation. Furthermore, but not as importantly, you may also want to consider reordering the subsection order in the methodology Section. This will allow to first present the two proposed losses, and then use them to describe the training process, this might aid the overall readability of the section.\n\nConsider stating fairly early in the paper (even perhaps in the abstract) that a *rigid* object is assumed -- this is of course fine, the problem is already hard enough even before considering deformable objects. Nevertheless I believe it would be beneficial for the interested reader that this assumption is explicitly stated early on.\n\nAnother criticism point arises from multiple empirical values used throughout the work, such as the object mass (although I realize this is essentially up to a scale), the friction coefficient, and several thresholds representing physical distances such as the contact threshold. Although the values seem reasonable, it might make sense to meta-optimize them or otherwise justify them in a more consistent manner.\n\nTo the best of my understanding, the intermediate mapping layer \\phi is not explicitly described, apart from describing it as a \"projection layer\". Is this a single linear layer? Is a non-linearity used? Perhaps an MLP of short depth? Please clarify\n\nRegarding the penetration depth metric, the paragraph defining it concludes \"Compared with previous works .... , our metric better reflects deep penetration cases\". Intuitively, how is this achieved? Are there any experiments to back this claim?\n\nAnother point that requires some attention is the perturbation strategy of the MANO parameters in the end of Section 3.2. This may need some attention, depending on what parameters are perturbed. MANO consists of pose and shape parameters, which may be further processed using PCA to reduce their total number. Where exactly are you applying the perturbation? How did you determine the (maximum) noise variance?\n\nFinally, the tackled problem has a long history and is still very actively researched. Space permitting, consider also citing the following related works:\nOikonomidis et al. Full dof tracking of a hand interacting with an object by modeling occlusions and physical constraints\nKyriazis et al.
