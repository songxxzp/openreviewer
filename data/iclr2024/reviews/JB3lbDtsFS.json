Instead, the current evaluation is more like supervised evaluation.\n\n*  I found the problem address highly similar to the following paper [1,2] that aims to model the label space in each step iteratively using Gibbs sampling (or previous like of work that used MCMC). This work may require annotation process in a more dynamic setting, still very relevant to subjective labelling task and I think, they are needed to discussed.\n\n    [1] Harrison, P., Marjieh, R., Adolfi, F., van Rijn, P., Anglada-Tort, M., Tchernichovski, O., ... & Jacoby, N.

For instance, in one of the tasks, MSP podcast dataset contains angry, sad, happy, neutral, and other. When continuous labels (valence-arousal annotations of the same dataset) is used, the skewed labeled distribution will be more visible. I suspect the proposed method to cause higher uncertainty (interrupter disagreement in less discovered part of label parameter space).\n\n* Different performance metrics are used. Particularly, Fleis' kappa for reliability of categorical labels is good. However, why did not you used Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in continuous labels instead of RMSE and the absolute error of the average standard deviations? In continuous/ordinal subjective labelling tasks, ICC reliability is one of the golden standards that define the labelling quality or difficulty of the task."

However, in all of the tables, the ensemble (tab 1,2)/gaussian process(tab 3) seem to be performing better than the proposed cnf method. While it is qualitatively visible that CNF is learning a better density distribution, the quantitative numbers dont justify the intuition. Perhaps, the authors would be well served by explicitly identifying the samples which possess such labelling bias, correct for it (by forcing the distribution to skew), and show better performance than all other methods. Right now, i see such form of analysis as lacking.\n\n[2]  What is the motivation behind latent-diffusion model. in my understanding, the marginal p(y|z) is already encoding information on different annotators z1,z2....z_m sampled over z. what does additional variable v inject into the model conceptually (apart from additional representational capacity).\n\n[3]  What is the reason for separate analysis of ordinal and categorical variables? I understand that ordinal categories are ordered, and that probability estimation then reduces to summing over the continuous space of latent variable v. However, I haven't seen standard classification setups explicitly enforce such ordering constraints. Also are there any cases where annotations are continuous (for eg, annotation by a speech etc.), which could be used to explore continuous cases? That could act as an interesting toy experiment.......\n\n[4] Possible extensions to cases where only single annotation is available for each sample:\n\t- how does this work compare to works which aim to filter noisy labels from the network. perhaps this could be mentioned in the related work. \n\nI like the fresh perspective  of learning distribution over labels, and how such system could act as an auto-labeller. However, the motivation does not reflect better performance on real-world metric (i.e. accuracy). Right now it feels like a fancy technique (i.e. density estimation) whose PRACTICAL real-world experiments i cannot see. Also, i dont see any experiments on zero-shot learning, which is the main title of the paper. \n\nFinally, this paper seems to present a chicken and egg problem. Most of the datasets in the real- world contain labels of only one annotator but might be biased. However, this paper does not work on them. Instead, it requires datasets where each sample has been annotated by many people. But that might not be how labelling happens in real-world. So, perhaps authors could discuss how to extend their method to single label cases where distributions could not be learnt. \n\nHowever, this work shows promise, and I would recommend the authors to improve the paper by addressing the above concerns and consider a future resubmission.\n\n-----\nPOST REBUTTAL\n-----\nThe authors were able to address most of the comments. Three main issues are still open,\n\n[1] The seeming unexplainable negative correlation between RMSE and Accuracy.\n\n-> Standard intuition suggests that lower RMSE should lead to higher accuracy in classification setups. If one accepts, that there are certain annotators (i.e. group of people) who are collectively biased, and that the sample might be incorrectly labelled, then, it should be possible to \u2018correct\u2019 for it. One way, could be perhaps reestimating the correct label and retrain the said classifier and SHOW better RMSE. I very much appreciate the authors efforts to add a new metric ICC to the setup. However, the actual increase on the accuracy (which is a well-accepted metric), would have convinced further and shown applicability on real world setup. Note that i am not asking for additional experiments on datasets which have only one label per sample, but only the performance improvements in the context of experiments the authors have already performed.\n\n[2] Zero shot density estimation.\n\n-> standard learning assumes that the neural net fits a density (which does not change) after the machine has learnt. during inference, a sample (from same/different distribution) is fed to the model and evaluated. The machine cant adapt its learnt density, since that is encoded in the weights which remain static.\n->the authors clarify zero shot as the ability to predict density of annotator responses p*, from a single phrase (x*).\n\t-> this might work, if the annotators (say A1) labelled a particular sample x1 (which was SEEN during training), and network is asked to predict A1\u2019s beliefs for a new sample x* (which has not been seen). However, the problem then does not remain zero shot since A1 was already seen by the network.\n\t-> If we accept (free will), i.e. one\u2019s personal beliefs are independent of statistical treatments of how other people respond, then merely sampling from the learnt distribution of annotator response, to \u2018simulate\u2019 how a prospective unseen annotator shall respond might not work.\n\n[3] Dynamic density adaptation\n\nThe idea of giving  networks the ability to adapt their densities dynamically to if a given sample is OOD seems promising. The only issue is that personal beliefs cant be given a density treatment. If so, then it doesn't remain zero shot.\n\nOverall, this is an interesting work, along above three points, it is not clear in what context this will be useful if it can not be used to improve the performance."
