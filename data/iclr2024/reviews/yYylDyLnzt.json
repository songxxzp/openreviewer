                "value": "The bin packing problem becomes even more complex when it involves multidimensional items and additional industrial constraints. While exact optimization methods exist for cuboid bin packing, they struggle with scalability and often neglect certain constraints, such as item rotation and stability. The paper proposes a column generation algorithm using the Danzig-Wolfe decomposition approach that incorporates both exact solvers and RL agents, offering improved lower bounds and more efficient solutions for the full 3D bin packing problem. The restricted master problem is solved by RL."

                "value": "The main weakness is the lack of contributions. For decades we know how to formulate standard bin packing by using DW and how to conduct column generation. It is also acceptable for a long time that the pricing problem can be solved as a relative simple IP or by RL (after all knapsack is sometimes solved as RL and the knapsack problem is the pricing problem in standard bin packing). I do not find anything innovative on the algorithm side in the paper. Apply RL in pricing in their specific context (multidimensional bin-packing) does not yield any novel contributions."

There are known stabilization techniques. I wonder why they have not been tried. \nBranch-and-price is a well established and in many cases the most effective algorithm for solving such problems (it combines branch-and-bound with column generation). Why is this methodology not being used as a benchmark?"

The author's comparison with baseline methods is limited. They used a dataset introduced in 1988, which is quite outdated. They should consider recent methods like 'Attend2pack: Bin packing through deep reinforcement learning with attention' and new datasets (BED-BPP: Benchmarking dataset for robotic bin packing problems, Learning Efficient Online 3D Bin Packing on Packing Configuration Trees) to compare their proposed method in terms of time cost and performance."
