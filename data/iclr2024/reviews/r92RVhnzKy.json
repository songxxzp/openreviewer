Such a hierarchical strategy helps to vastly improve the deraining effects, especially in these challenging cases. The proposed framework is called Region Transformer (Regformer), consisting of Region Masked Attention (RMA) mechanism and a Mixed Gate Forward Block (MGFB). Extensive experiments are conducted on all current representative deraining datasets, and both RMA and MGFB are verified to be effective in dealing with deraining degradations."
