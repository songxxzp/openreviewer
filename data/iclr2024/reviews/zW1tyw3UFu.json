                "value": "To address the challenges of multivariate time series forecasting, this paper introduces 'Dozerformer,' an innovative approach that incorporates adaptive sparse attention mechanisms. Drawing insights from the analysis of seasonality and locality within the attention maps of Transformers, it introduces the concepts of 'local attention' and 'stride attention.' Moreover, recognizing that using the entire historical sequence may not always be beneficial for accurate forecasting, the paper introduces 'varying attention.' This feature adjusts the number of historical observations attended to based on the forecasting positions. As a result, Dozerformer demonstrates exceptional performance when compared to eight different baseline models across a range of forecasting tasks, effectively reducing attention-related computational costs."

                "value": "**Problems in motivations**\n\n1. In the second paragraph of the first page, the authors argue \"predicting the value at horizon 1 using the entire historical sequence is suboptimal and inefficient.\". This is the main motivation of vary attention in cross-attention modules. However, the reason for suboptimality is not provided in this paragraph. Why do we have to use varying-sequence attention?\n\n2. The target task is multivariate time series forecasting. In this task, considering inter-feature connections is also important as well as temporal connections [1]. However, there is a discrepancy between the characteristics of the main task and your method. In other words, Dozerformer doesn't incorporate any parts to consider inter-feature dependencies. Can you explain the reason for this design or Do I understand wrong?\n\n3. In the second paragraph of the first page, the authors argue \"They (might include Transformers with full attention) also ignored the characteristics of MTS data, like locality and seasonality.\". This is the reason for local and stride attention. However, when observing Figure 1 (a), Transformers with full attention already capture locality and seasonality automatically. At this point, why do we have to make constraints on self-attention?\n\n4. For the motivation of local attention, the authors mention local properties in Figure 3(a) (it might be Figure 1(a)) in Section 3.2.1. However,   the tokens of the attention map in Figure 1(a) are observations. However, because your method includes patchifying, the tokens of yours are patches. The characteristics of patches cannot be directly explained by that of observations.\n\n**Incomplete equations**\n\n1. I recommend that the detailed formula of the dimension invariant embedding (DI Embed) should be included. I think many people might encounter DI Embed for the first time because [2] including DI Embed is not widely known. This makes readers easy to understand.\n\n2. When decomposing time series into seasonal and trend parts, you might use average pooling and residual techniques. Although the same techniques are used in other papers, I recommend mentioning average pooling in your manuscript. Also, I'm curious about what kernel size is used for this average pooling.\n\n3. For the Linear model to process $X_t$, can you include the formula of Linear model in the manuscript?\n\n4. Eq. (2), (3), and (4) can be written more clearly, for example, with 'if else'.\n\n5. In Eq. (4), I think something is wrong because when i = 1 and v = 3, $t-v+i-t<0$. Indices cannot be negative. Can you fix it?\n\n**Insufficient experiments**\n\n1. In Section 4.3, you just give us theoretical complexity. Can you give a cost comparison in an empirical way such as flops or wall-clock time?\n\n2. In Table 3. it seems that local, stride, and vary attention modules are not quite helpful for forecasting in ETTh1 and ETTm1. Can you give more experimental results to prove the efficacy of the three modules?\n\n[1] Zhang et al., Crossformer: Transformer Utilizing Cross-Dimension Dependency for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting, 2023, ICLR  \n[2] Zhang et al., Multi-scale transformer pyramid networks for multivariate time series forecasting"

I am assuming that each of figure in 1b refer to the corresponding specific component (such as 'full', 'local' etc.). Furthermore, what is the stride value in 1b-stride.\n\n\nSection 3.1 is a bit unclear. How are the outputs of 1x1 conv and the linear layers combined. I assume that the linear layer produce an output $\\in \\mathbb{R}^{I \\times D_1}$ which is then projected to  $X_{pred}$ after combining with the output of 1x1 conv. However it is not clear how the I rows of $X_{t}$ matrix get converted to O rows so that they can be added to the output of 1x1 conv.\n\n\nThe explorations are performed on datasets that contain signals that perhaps do not change at a very fast rate rate. It would be good to have experiments on fast changing data. The effectiveness of local , stride and vary can be more clear on such datasets. \n\n\nIt is also not clear about the practical significance of the difference in forecasted numbers from the different model. Ideally, the forecasted numbers would be used in another appropriate downstream task to show how the different forecasting mechanisms perform. MSE/MAE numbers are perhaps not enough. For example, in Figure 4/5 , several forecasting approaches produce plots that are very close to each other. Therefore, they might perform equivalently when the forecasted data is used for downstream task.\n\n\nAs efficiency is one of the focus areas of this work, if possible, it would be good to have actual computation numbers (such as memory and wall-clock time) for the proposed approach. A comparison of such numbers from other baselines (if available) would also be useful."
