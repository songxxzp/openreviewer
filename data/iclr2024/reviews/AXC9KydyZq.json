We may expect some sentivity with the chosen method. I did not see any discussion on this part. Furthermore there exists better methods than RRWM like\n    - [KerGM](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/hash/cd63a3eec3319fd9c84c942a08316e00-Abstract.html) which is able to use edge attributes\n    - [GWL](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/xu19b.html)\n- the comparison with the state of art is missing many others existing methods. The proposed methods are all from the very same team. I would expect a better state-of-art. For example on the deep learning side we have (to cite a few),\n    - [SIGMA](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/liu21i/liu21i.pdf)\n    - [Universe Points Representation Learning for Partial Multi-Graph Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00780)\n    - [DGMC](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyeJf1HKvS)\n- the full framework is focus on images.
