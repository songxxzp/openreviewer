The main proposal of the paper is that instead of focusing on time-only or frequency-only relations between consecutive frames, they should be jointly modeled. The acoustic model uses wav2vec2 features from audio and concatenates them with the features extracted from the relational thinking based graph embeddings before applying a classification layer. The model parameters are trained using a variational lower bound based approach. Experimental results show that joint time-frequency relations are important and the proposed method can outperform the wav2vec2 based baseline in phone recognition task on TIMIT. Analysis of the results show that the model is more effective on vowels as compared to the consonants."

However, from the description in the paper, there is no distinction between relational thinking based modeling and self-attention based modeling. For example, with several self-attention modeling layers stacked, it's equivalent to the so called relational thinking based model that pair-wised relation will be learnt among the transformed forms of each node (each time step), rather than the single step embedding. Therefore, theoretically, there is no difference between self-attention and relational thinking based method. \n2, The experiment part is not complete. In order to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed relational thinking based method compared to the self-attention based method, the results of the self-attention should be included as one of the baseline results. However, the results of the paper only includes these feature extraction based method without extra modeling. In addition, the paper should also list the model size of each compared method to have a more fair comparision.  \n3, The tradeoff study between temporal context and spectral context is not able to lead such conclusion that higher frequency domain resolution provideds more benefits compared higher time domain resolution, as the results of these two setting are very close in the test set (20.80 vs. 20.66)."

Additionally, while the proposed system's results are good on the task (9.2% PER on the test set from Table 2), the reported wav2vec 2.0 baseline numbers (9.98% PER on the test set) are not the numbers that are reported in that paper (8.3% PER on the test set).

It is not clear which weights we should expect to be strong or weak, although some are strong and some are weak. \n\nThere is also an analysis of the proportion of frames in which each phoneme is predicted in figure 6, showing that the proposed system predicts phonemes with closer proportions to the ground truth than the baseline system of wav2vec 2.0, although it does not show error rates or accuracies for these predictions.
