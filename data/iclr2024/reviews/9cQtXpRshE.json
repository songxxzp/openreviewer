The model not only supports concurrent segmentation of multiple 3D entities but also champions efficiency, demanding fewer user inputs and providing swifter inference times. Comprehensive evaluations indicate its superiority over extant methods across both individual and multi-object interactive segmentation benchmarks."

And for efficiency, the submission does not present a technical point on how to improve efficiency. Multi-object segmentation is also achieved by the previous methods (InterObject3D) via some small improvements. Actually, the performance on the multi-object segmentation is not the best, according to Table 4.\n2) Limited Evaluation: The appendix focuses more on providing information and supplementary materials than conducting extensive evaluations. A more thorough evaluation of the framework's performance and comparison with existing approaches would enhance the paper's credibility. The various datasets are also a strong evaluation, especially for the interactive tools. I suggest some results on the real captured and other challenging datasets should be presented in the paper.\n3) The running time should be reported in a fair manner; for table 5, it is not clear how to perform the comparison since the manuscript claims efficiency as a contribution. Or, the user study is a good choice to compare the efficiency.\nIn some challenging cases, there are a lot of occlusions between the segmented object and other objects in the scene.\n4) The significant difference between interobject3D and interobject3D++ should be discussed comprehensively since the published paper is very relative to the submission.\n5) From Figure 1, the input only presents the XYZ + RGB, i.e., the point cloud and point color. Why does the visualization have the faces? Could you use the faces as extra information to enhance the performance of the proposed methods? From the interactive demo, there is still the face visualization.\n6) The related works are very sparse, especially for the 3D instantce segmentations. I suggest the author refer to some surveys about the 3D segmentation and discuss more papers on it, especially for the pointnet and pointnet++.\n7) For the comparison, it is not clear to me: Are the fewer user clicks the same for the different methods?\n8) The failure cases and limitations are not discussed comprehensively in the submission; these parts are very important for the complete manuscripts, and some failure cases should be presented in the submission."
