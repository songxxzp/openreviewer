Specifically, the proposed architecture comprises a sort of self-supervised task wherein the low-dimensional data is input into an encoder module which produces the corresponding high-dimensional output (predicted). This predicted high-dimensional output is passed into a transition module which predicts the high-dimensional output at the next time step. This high-dimensional output at the successive time-step is downsampled (by a deterministic function) and compared with the ground-truth low-dimensional data using a data-driven loss."
