                "value": "The authors propose PICLE a probabilistic approach to spawn, compose and train a series of neural modules for solving continual and transfer learning tasks with compositionality. The proposed method considers two separate scenarios:  perceptual transfer, where the input space is the same for all tasks and the output function has to be adapted; and latent transfer, where the output functions have to be reused on new input spaces. For the first scenario, the authors approximate the input distribution of each module with the combination of a low-rank gaussian distribution and the accuracy as the prior. The final path is found by greedy search. For the second scenario, the authors use Bayesian optimization and a Gaussian process to approximate the accuracy of unseen module combinations. One of the main advantages of the proposed approach is that it scales with respect to the number of tasks sinc it evaluates a constant number of compositions and trains a network with a fixed size for each task. The proposed approach achieves state of the art perfomance on CTrL as well as on a new compositional version of CTrL named BELL by the authors."
