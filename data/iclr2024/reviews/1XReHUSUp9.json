At the moment, steganography based on deep learning is very detectable (in the sense of evaluation under Kerkchoff's principle), since it generates images with non-natural noise. Moreover, the capacity of steganography based on deep learning is very inferior in terms of capacity to classical steganography by cover modification, where to my knowledge the state of the art is [1]. This means that rational attacker has a little incentive to use suboptimal methods, where better ones exists.  \n\nNeedless to say, state of the art steganography is usually fragile, which means that changing a single pixel might (in modern scheme very likely will) make the extraction of the message impossible. With the respect, the proposed work is not solving the right problem, since modern algorithm certainly do not survive JPEG compression. Of course, there are works on making steganography robust [2], but at the expense of the capacity, as part of the capacity needs to be reserved for the error correction.  \n\nWith respect to the above, I have found the work very shallow. It claims that existing techniques for steganography by cover modification does not work without even trying. Moreover, the comparison would not be made equal, because of differences in capacity, choice of the algorithm by the attacker.\n\n\n[1] Bernard, Sol\u00e8ne, et al. \"Backpack: a Backpropagable Adversarial Embedding Scheme.\" IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security 17 (2022): 3539-3554.\n\n[2] Kin-Cleaves, Christy, and Andrew D.

It appears that the noise variance parameter beta is left unspecified and only the time step parameter is identified, with no explanation of how it was set other than the ablation study. Steganography methods often have a strength parameter that can be varied, and it is not clear how important it is to match the diffusion strength to a particular steganography implementation and strength level. Choice of diffusion parameters may be critical to determine the level of steganography that can be sanitized, as evidenced by the ablation study. It appears that the same dataset was used (CIFAR test set) for all of the experiments. If the parameters of the sanitization model (timestep t) were selected based on experiments performed using the same steganography methods and images, the method is technically not completely blind since the diffusion strength was tuned experimentally to the embedding method performance.  The ablation study lacks in quantitative results. The visualization is helpful, but should not replace quantifiable metrics."
