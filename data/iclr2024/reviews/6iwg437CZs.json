The layers use a form of Tsallis \u03b1-entropy regularization so as to induce sparse encoding. The authors provide several theoretical results on the capacity and convergence speed of new Hopfield model. Besides the use of this layer, the STANHOP architecture adopts several new solutions, such as the use of Plug-and-Play and Tune-and-Play memory plugin modules.\n\nThe experiments are solely focused on timeseries prediction tasks and compare several versions of the STANHOP architecture with several existing Transformers baselines."

This results in a paper that lacks a cohesive narrative, as it is unclear why these different novel parts should fit together. As a consequence, it is difficult for the reader to properly evaluate the merits of the different contributions. In my opinion, the main contribution is the introduction of the alpha-entropy regularized sparse Hopfield layers and their analysis. However, it is unclear to me why these layers should only be validated in multivariate timeseries prediction problems.  All in all, the specialized nature of the application does not match well with the general nature of the analysis in the first half of the paper. \n\nWhile the experimental analysis on timeseries data is rigorous, the results are rather disappointing since the main focus of the paper was to solve this specialized problem. The proposed architecture performs worse than at least one baseline model (DLinear) and in general it performs very similarly to the other methods."

Thus it is important to mention these relevant work.\n\nSecond, improving the memory capability of Hopefield network is widely studied these days [7-9], thus comparison should be done with these relevant approaches, especially 8 and 9.\n\nI would like to see a comparison against RNNs and memory-augmented RNNs, given that the proposed model is focused on time-series which is a stateful problem.\n\nFinally, what is the memory footprint? How much time model takes per epoch? Model size?\nDo you observe faster convergence? How stable is the model? All these questions should be addressed.\n\nI would like to see the variance of the model, including baseline models.\n\n\n\n1.\tDas, S., Giles, C. and Sun, G.Z., 1992.

How would such a \"argmax\"-based lookup memory perform like in the experiments? (Some of the gradients will be zero, but the same happens some of the times with high alpha too, even if not always.)\n\nSome theoretical issues in definitions:\n\n- in the definition of the Tsallis entropy (3.1), the bottom branch for alpha=1 seems wrong, as it gives the negative of what would be the top branch for alpha=2. I expected by continuity to define alpha=1 as the Shannon entropy -sum p log p. Am I missing something?\n\n- In equation (3.2), the definition of $\\Psi_{\\alpha}^\\star$ seems surprising: $\\alpha$-entmax is a vector-value function, thus so should be its integral, but the energy H(x) should be scalar-value. I expect (as stated also elsewhere in the paper) that $\\Psi_\\alpha^\\star$ should be the Fenchel convex conjugate of $\\Psi_\\alpha$, i.e. $\\Psi_\\alpha^\\star(z) = \\sup_{z^\\star \\in \\operatorname{dom}{\\Psi_\\alpha}} \\langle z^\\star, z \\rangle - \\Psi_\\alpha(z^\\star)$. Could you please clarify?\n\nOther questions:\n\n - It was not clear to me how the memories Y are constructed; in section 4.3 it seems like the memories must be the same length as the input sequence R. Is this a strong requirement or could it be avoided? A nice property of attention models is that they should support variable length data.\n- The qualitative change at alpha=2 in Theorem 3.1 seems surprising and interesting. Could you discuss the difference a bit, especially the difference between the Max terms that show up, and give some intuition about why we see this change? Is one of the bounds always tighter than the other or does this depend on choices of (m, M, d, beta, etc?) I did not have the time to read the proof."
