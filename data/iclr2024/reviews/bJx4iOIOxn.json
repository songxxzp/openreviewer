I wonder if prompt size is one of the tuned hyper-parameters. If so, it would be better to present the exact number of prompts used for each setting since different prompt size indicates different learning capacity.\n3. In fact the original VPT has two variants, i.e. VPT-shallow and VPT-deep. It seems VPT-deep is adopted in this paper. I wonder if the same pattern holds for VPT-shallow too.\n4. It is noteworthy that VPT only performs better in half of all datasets of VTAB-1k Structured in one-shot setting as shown in Tab.4, which is different from results of other two sub-categories. This should be highlighted and illustrated in Sec.4.4.\n5. The current scope of this paper is ok. But it would be much greater if the authors could expand the study to prompt tuning in language models."

                "value": "The authors attempt to answer the question: When and why VPT is effective. They conduct extensive experiments on 19 diverse datasets and tasks, wherein VPT outperformed FT in 16 instances (VTAB-1k [110] image classification benchmark). The model is ViT (and the authors observed the same tendency when they use Swin).\n\nIn exploring the \u201cwhen\u201d dimension, they find that VPT is preferrable when there is 1) a substantial disparity between the original and the downstream task objectives (e.g., transitioning from classification to counting), or 2) a similarity in data distributions between the two tasks (e.g., both involve natural images).\nIn exploring the \u201cwhy\u201d dimension, they find that VPT\u2019s success cannot be attributed solely to overfitting and optimization considerations and that VPT preserves features and add parameters in a unique manner.\n\nSpecifically, \n- VPT reaches superior performance than FT in two different scenarios: (1) when the disparity between the task objectives of the original and downstream tasks is high, or (2) when the data distributions are similar.\n- The performance gap between full finetuning and prompt tuning decreases as the amount of training data increases. \n- Although full finetuning generally achieves higher accuracy when rich data examples are available, the prompt tuning still reaches a competitive performance with much fewer parameters.\n- In one-shot classification, prompt tuning outperforms full finetuning in many tasks and achieving substantially higher accuracy in some cases (i.e., 41.66% vs 56.94% in VTAB-1k Natural).\n- Training and testing losses consistently decrease in scenarios where the task objectives are similar between the original and downstream tasks. In such cases, overfitting is not the cause of performance degradation of FT.\n- The presence of additional dimensions does not significantly aid the optimization process.\n- Preserving the original feature proves to be crucial for transferring to downstream tasks, as evidenced by the superior performance of VPT compared to FT-then-PT.\n- Maintaining a fixed feature space in VPT may compel it to learn more valuable embeddings with the trainable prompts, as it significantly outperforms the Mixed method.\n- Therefore, pretrained parameters play a pivotal role in capturing general features in transfer learning. That is, the preservation of initial\nfeatures is important for VPT\u2019s success, but in a very sophisticated manner.\n\nOverall, the authors find many characteristics of VPT in the context of \"FT vs. VPT,\" although some of them might be an overstatement."

Do you think all the results are also valid when we use CNNs?\n\n- [Comment (major)] In Figure 4,\n> In general, with the dataset increasing in size, the performance gap between FT and VPT becomes narrow.\n\nI would like to see more results before the conclusion because Figure 4 shows that some of curves are not monotonic, which is counterintuitive, and that the behaviors of the curves highly depends on the data and methods.\n\n- [Question (major)] Figure 4: Does this result include the randomness introduced by the choice of the training set samples? The broken yellow curve in the left panel looks intensely fluctuating in the small set region, and I guess this fluctuation comes from that kind of randomness.\n\n- [Question (major)] In one-shot classification experiment (Table 3), how did the authors choose the single training sample? The performance should highly correlate with the one-shot training sample.\n\n- [Comment] At the end of Section 4,\n> These results further support our assumption that prompt tuning is more effective than full finetuning when only limited finetuning examples are available.\n\nDoesn't this statement conflict with the Patch Camelyon result (green curves) in Figure 4?\n\n- [Comment] Figure 5 should use log scales. Also, all figures including Figure 5 should be vector images.\n\n- [Comment] In Section 5.2,\n> Another possible explanation for why prompt tuning can achieve superior performance is that it can escape from local minima or saddle points compared to full finetuning, due to the additional dimensions introduced by the prompts.\n\nThis is clearly an overstatement (or a misuse of words). Local minima and saddle points are rigorously defined in a mathematical way. I guess what the authors mean here is if we can observe performance gain or not. However, strictly speaking, escaping form local minima or saddle points is not  a necessary nor sufficient condition of generalization in general settings. Although I understand some papers use these words interchangeably, and my comment may be a bit nitpicking, I would like to recommend that the authors modify the statement here. By the way, it will be a dramatic research if one theoretically proves that VPT in fact makes the network escape from local minima or saddle points.\n\n- [Comment] In Section 5.3, the authors make two hypotheses. Is there any idea to validate them in an objective and qualitative manner?"

Indeed as in the title, the problem that the paper is trying to tackle is quite important but also not fully explored yet, i.e., the elephant in the room. VPT is widely used in multiple areas as a common tool to adapt pre-trained models to downstream tasks, not only in recognition, but also in dense prediction, vision language model and even generation nowadays. However, there are very few works talking about this classic \u201cwhen and why\u201d problem such that people could understand VPT better and also use it in a better practice.\n3. Some of the extensive experiments are quite convincing, especially the analysis on downstream data scale (Sec. 4.4) and hypothesis on overfitting (Sec. 5.1).\n4. The hypothesis on (a) how data distribution and task similarity gonna affect VPT\u2019s performance (Sec 4.3); (b) why VPT outperforms FT from an optimization perspective (Sec 5.2) are quite interesting.

Adding more tasks including the detention or dense prediction ones could be better. \n- In Sec. 5.2, although Fig. 7 is very intriguing, the experiment results are not able to support it, i.e., Mixed and FT-then-PT still fall behind VPT with clear margins. This also leads to a very ambiguous conclusion in the last paragraph in Sec. 5.2.\n2. The comparison of GradCAM visualization in Sec. 5.4 is not very informative (the distinction is not that huge, plus more like a calibration difference?) and it\u2019s also hard to draw any convincing conclusion from it.\n3. In Tab. 1, Mixed and FT-then-PT are included without any introduction in the Sec. 4.1 alongside, which could be very confusing to the audience. Maybe remove them from Tab. 1 and make another comparison table in Sec. 5.2, where these two methods are actually introduced?\n4. The number of wins notation was introduced in Tab. 3 but has already appeared in Tab. 1 and 2 before, which could confuse the audience. Also, \u2018[]\u2019 was used for both this notation and also reference. Maybe change it to \u2018()\u2019 to avoid any confusion?\n5. A similar observation on data scale (Sec. 4.4) is actually also covered in the original VPT paper/experiments (Page 8, Fig. 3)."

It seems the examples are all from natural image classification. It would be helpful to compare the attention on four quadrants of transfer learning to see the difference when data/task disparity varies and how it is connected to the conclusion in Section 4. \n\n2. The visualization of attention in Section 5.4 is based on GradCAM. Have the authors tried visualizing the attention from cls token to other tokens, as in previous work in the ViT literature (e.g., [1])? On the other hand, a previous paper [2] also discusses the relation between transfer learning and attention. They find that current transfer learning methods tend to have noisy attention and fixing the attention can boost the transfer learning performance. It would be helpful to add some discussion on the relation between this work and [2].\n\n3. This paper is focused on VPT. Since other transfer learning methods such as LoRA [3] may have more favorable performances on various transfer learning tasks like VTAB-1k, readers may wonder if these methods also have similar properties. It would be helpful to see if the same conclusions also hold for other transfer learning methods. \n\n[1] Caron, Mathilde, et al. \"Emerging properties in self-supervised vision transformers.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF international conference on computer vision. 2021.\n[2] Baifeng Shi, Siyu Gai, Trevor Darrell, and Xin Wang.
