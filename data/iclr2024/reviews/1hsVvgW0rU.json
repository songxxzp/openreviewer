                "value": "This work studies the problem of sample-efficient learning in POMDP. Especially, a new feedback model is discussed, i.e., multiple observations in hindsight, where instead of one observation in canonical POMDP setting, after one trajectory, multiple extra observations can be obtained. This feedback model extends the canonical single-observation feedback model in POMDP and is suitable to capture applications such as game-playing where replaying or loading is enabled.\n\nBased on this new feedback model, one new revealing condition is presented, i.e., multi-observation revealing, which is extended from canonical revealing conditions in POMDP. Based on this condition, the k-OMLE design is first proposed, which is demonstrated to be sample efficient. Then, a second class of POMDP, defined as distinguishable POMDP, is also introduced, which relies on the intuition that different states should have distinct observation generation. The relationship between multi-observation revealing POMDP and distinguishable POMDP is established. Furthermore, leveraging the techniques from closeness testing and POMDP with hindsight observation, a new design, OST, is proposed, which is also demonstrated to be sample efficient."

Having multiple observations is also a valid and practical consideration in my view as indeed replaying or loading is often allowed in settings such as game-playing.\n\n- The paper is organized well and the overall flow is quite clear.

The authors consider structural assumptions under which learning with K-observations is statistically tractable and provide algorithms to tackle them. The main results are as follows: \n1. First, the authors show via a lower bound that even under the K observation model, we need additional assumptions to make learning tractable. \n2. Then they consider additional structural called multi-observation revealing POMDPs and distinguishable POMDPs under which statistically efficient learning is possible. The former considers a rank-type assumption on the observation matrix whereas the latter considers a separability assumption on the columns. The two assumptions are equivalent to each other up to polynomial factor blow-up in k. \n3. They provide algorithms for efficient learning under the above assumptions."

Can the authors provide examples of settings where (a) one can get k-observations, but (b) we do not have the ability to reset to the latent state (or generative model)? My worry is that the ability to reset to the latent state needs knowledge of the latent state which is practically equivalent to hindsight observability (in the game playing example provided in the paper one seems to need knowledge of the latent state to reset).  \n\n\nAnother related work to compare to: \"Agnostic Reinforcement Learning with Low-Rank MDPs and Rich Observations\", Dann et. al. 2021. Their algorithm seems to work for POMDP settings with low-rank dynamics - while the dependence on d is exponential, their work does not seem to require any lower bound on \\alpha and thus could be applicable when d is small/constant but \\alpha could be arbitrarily small. I am pointing this out because the authors seem to portray \\alpha-distinguishable POMDPs as the largest class of POMDPs that could be solvable statistically efficiently, however,  Dann et. al. 2021 gives another example which is solvable under orthogonal assumptions."

I am guessing that proposition 3 already captures this, but can you please provide more intuition on why we can expect such separation. \n2. Are there settings where one can get k-observations but only at the end of the episode? In particular, one needs to wait to terminate to get more observations. \n3.  From what I understand, it is a feature of the algorithm that only needs full trajectory information to construct MLEs. Hence, there is no separation between getting k-observations in real-time or at the end of the episode. Is there a fundamental separation between the two settings? \n4.
