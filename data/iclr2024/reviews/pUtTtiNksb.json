                "value": "The paper introduces the Feature-based Fast Cascade Alignment network (FFCA-Net), a novel approach to stereo image compression (SIC) suited for applications such as 3D imaging and car-mounted cameras. Contrary to conventional methods reliant on joint encoding and decoding, which place a substantial burden on the encoding terminal, FFCA-Net adopts a strategy of independent encoding and joint decoding, effectively minimizing decoding latency. The network implements a coarse-to-fine cascaded alignment methodology. Initially, it applies a feature domain patch-matching module to reduce redundancy and noise, succeeded by a sparse stereo refinement network aimed at precise alignment of inter-image features. Subsequently, a lightweight yet potent Fast Feature Fusion network (FFF) is utilized to adeptly decode the aligned features."
