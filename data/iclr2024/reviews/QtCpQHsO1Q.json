The three datasets, MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, used to construct the experimental scenarios, are somewhat simplistic. Moreover, certain experiments and metrics are only disclosed for one or two of these datasets.\n2. The disclosure of experimental hyperparameters appears to be incomplete. Algorithm hyperparameters, network hyperparameters, hyperparameters for comparison methods, random seeds, and other relevant details should be fully presented. Experimental results should include the mean and variance of metrics from multiple trials.\n3. The two types of distribution changes in the experimental setup are not intuitive, lacking visualization, making it difficult for readers to perceive the extent of label distribution shift in the experimental setup. It is also challenging to determine what the most extreme scenarios included in the experimental setup are like.\n4. The applicability of the algorithm should be thoroughly discussed. Considerations such as when the algorithm might fail, its compatibility with other algorithms and models, and its performance in extreme conditions (such as extreme imbalance or unseen categories) should be discussed.\n\nThe above points are just requirements for an 8-score paper. Of course, even if these issues are not addressed, I acknowledge that this paper is above the acceptance threshold."

In Eqn. (10) the sample weight \\pai\\_i^k is used, however, in the context, only \\pai\\^k is discussed.\n(2)\tThere exists some minor error, such as the \u201ci\u201d in Eqn.(7) is confusion with different range, and in Appendix, the No. of equation is wrongly used, for example, \u201cCombining Eq.(17) and Eq. (20), we have\u201d,\u201d Combining Eq. (22), Eq. (24), Eq. (25) and Eq. (26), we have\u201d. The method BBSE is wrongly written as BBLS in \"which outperforms both BBSL and RLLS across diverse datasets and.......\".
