                "value": "The authors proposed GEAM, a molecular generative framework for drug discovery inspired by the fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) strategy used to explore the vast chemical space. GEAM distinguishes itself from other computational FBDD approaches by its unique approach to selecting fragments. It employs a Fragment-wise Graph Information Bottleneck (FGIB) module, drawing from the principles of graph information bottleneck (GIB). This module identifies fragments that are particularly relevant to the target chemical property. The extracted fragments are exploited by a generative model consisting of a fragment assembly module that generates new molecules from the fragments and a fragment modification module that outputs new molecules with new fragments that were not present in the original fragment vocabulary. These new fragments can then be assessed by the fragment extraction module to expand GEAM's exploration of the chemical space. The reported experiments seem to show that GEAM has better performance at discovering new drug candidates than existing molecular optimization methods, ablation studies also show the importance of each module of GEAM for effective molecular generation."

Additionally, leveraging molecules generated by the modification module to expand the fragment vocabulary further bolsters this strategy.\n- The paper is well written and gives a good intuition of each module of GEAM, justifying their choice and their roles within the generative process.\n- The paper's treatment of related works is comprehensive. It firmly situates the research in the context of prior work on drug discovery.\n- Strong experimental evidence of the efficacy of the model for molecular generation, with ablation studies that highlight the importance of each module.\n- The experiment section shows the importance of a proper selection of fragments for molecule generation, with representations learned through FGIB proving highly suitable for this task.\n- Emphasis on the vital role of goal-driven fragment selection and the value of generating molecules as assemblies of those fragments, rather than solely focusing on fragment modification.\n- Generative algorithms chosen for the modification module not only help to generate novel molecules but also feed FGIB to extract new instances for the fragment vocabulary."
