It is not a big issue but for better clarity I think there should be one.\n\n2. I have three main concerns: (1) limited novelty, which leads to weak theoretical analysis; (2) overclaimed contribution; (3) parameter choice of $\\rho$.\n- (1) Geometric modularity is used frequently for evaluation if there's no label at all (in contrast to pseudo-unsupervised), it is already a routine to examine clustering results. Therefore introducing an algorithm simply maximizing it does not shed new light. This also leads to a weak theoretical analysis which is basically proving what is assumed. I understand the authors want a \"reasonable\" datasets. But the point of beyond-worst-case analysis, per my understanding, is to avoid pathological instances but not to design properties of datasets tailored to what we want to prove. In definition 3.1, for example if one item is removed or relaxed, the proof breaks down.\n\n- (2) I agree with the claim that \"The unsupervised geometric modularity tracks a supervised measure AMI\". But the positive relationship between this two measure is also known to the community, especially in the lens of density-based clustering. I am not sure if any previous work formally states this, but in this paper it is still shown by experiments. But anyway I can stay open to discussion. \n\n- (3) If I am understanding correctly, the motivation is to get rid of the parameter choice on $\\varepsilon$, then what is the point if we have to choose $\\rho$ again? Indeed, theorem 3.2 gives a range, but it is subject to other parameters given by the dataset, and according to section 4, it is selected in [0.5, 1].\n\n3. The experiments include quite a number of datasets but not enough clustering methods. For example, SOM, HDBSCAN, or even $k$-means with the best $k$."

I think it is natural to ask if we can also apply similar approahces to the geometric modularity here, without using any auxiliiary tools such as DB-SCAN. If there are any critical challanges e.g. computational complexity, it might be worthy to point these out, and such challenges can be also good motivations for instead applying geometric modularity to DB-SCAN. Currently, it seems like there is a lack of such discussion. \n- I was a little bit confused about the originarity of the geometric modularity, as it is defined very similar to Eq.(1.1) in [2] which is also mentioned by the authors. Therefore, I think in prior to introducing the geometric modularity, it might be better to give a more detailed introducing fisrt on the modularity on unweighted graph, such as  Eq.(1) in [1], then its generalized version on weighted graph, e.g. Eq.(1.1) in [2]. As a result, the geometric modularity can be better motivated and their differences (I think the biggest difference is on the extra parameter $\\rho$) is more clearly demonstrated.\n- In the experimental results, the performance of OPTICS is dramatically poor compared to the DB-SCAN with geometric modularity. However, given that the high similarity between OPTICS and DB-SCAN, I would not expect such a huge performance gap exists, and thus I am very curious on the root causes, which could fall onto the following two categories from my opinions:\n    1. The methodology of OPTICS essentially fails in these datasets, no matter how we choose the hyper parameters\n    2. The result of OPTICS is sensitive to the hyper-parameters, and the parameters chosen in the experiments is still far from the optimal one.\n\n- Currently, the answer is still not clear to me eventhough the result in Section A.3 might shed some light. Finding the root cause is important as it provides the more evidence on why we should use geometric modularity rather than OPTICS. If the reason is on the methodology of OPTICS, I would expect to see some plots on the ordered list of reachable distances generated by OPTICS, and see if there is indeed no clear clustering pattern no matter how the steepness is chosen. If the reason is on the hyper-parameters, maybe a wider range of $\\xi$ should be verified in Section A.3\n\n\n[1] Newman, Mark EJ. \"Modularity and community structure in networks.\" Proceedings of the national academy of sciences 103.23 (2006): 8577-8582.\n\n[2] Arenas, Alex, Alberto Fernandez, and Sergio Gomez. \"Analysis of the structure of complex networks at different resolution levels.\" New journal of physics 10.5 (2008): 053039."
