To fix this, KMIFQE learns a Gaussian kernel for the target policy and applies the kernel relaxation to the deterministic target policy, to avoid the zero in the importance sampling ratio."

The optimal bandwidth of the kernel is also derived, for balancing the bias and variance. The theoretical results about the bias, variance, and optimal bandwidth are empirically checked as well.\n\n- The experiment result section includes a visualization of the estimated Q value in a low-dimensional toy environment. This helps the reader to understand how the new method works, and I appreciate that."

                "value": "- I would appreciate it if the authors could explain more on the significance of the research question. The paper indicates the method is designed for continuous control tasks. In continuous control tasks, it is common to see an agent learn a stochastic policy instead of a deterministic policy, as many of the reinforcement learning algorithms suitable for continuous control tasks can work with a stochastic policy (BCQ, IQL, InAC, IAC, etc.), and it is also a simple and straightforward solution to avoid the zero importance sampling ratio. I think the importance of solving the issue in deterministic policy evaluation can be clearer if the paper can include an explanation of when people suffer from this issue in practice.\n\n- Another question is about the experiment setting. When proposing the new method, the paper indicates that the method is for in-sample learning. However, in the experiment section, the target policy is trained by TD3. The behavior policy is different from the target policy and does not guarantee to be in-sample (the target policy is a stochastic policy generated from another TD3 learned policy, whose performance is 70%~80% of the target policy, according to the paper). It is not clear to me how the in-sample condition is ensured in the experiment."

                "value": "1. The paper is begging for an example of when you might want to evaluate a deterministic policy using data generated by a stochastic policy. From my experience, in reinforcement learning we often have to inverse problem. For instance, if using expert data generated through a pid controller or other classic control algorithm we will encounter deterministic behavior policies. Other than as baselines to compare RL algorithms, I\u2019m struggling to understand when we might encounter the need to evaluate a deterministic policy. If this is the only example, that isn\u2019t a deal breaker but an example would make the paper much better.\n2. It is unclear what parts of the algorithm are learned and what is not learned/given. I believe A(s) is learned (in the full version of KMIFQE) and the value function it self is learned. Are any other parts learned? Maybe a section clearly stating the algorithm succinctly before or after proving the various artifacts would be beneficial to clarify exactly the moving parts.\n3. There should be a statement on how the hyperparameters are chosen for all the methods. While this is in the appendix, there should be space made for this in the main paper. One notable missing part of this was a discussion on how to set the bandwidth. Is this given or determined by the data (through equation 10)? If it is given, are there any rules of thumb that would help practitioners? This is discusse briefly how this determines the bias-variance trade-off, but I believe this is lacking further exploration for practical use-cases.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n- Section 4/4.1 is written in an extremely dense manner. This is partially necessary due to the complexity of the math behind the kernel relaxation for the target policy, but I believe the authors could have done more to explain the theorems and propositions in more intuitive forms. I also believe separating section 4.2 into two sections could be beneficial (Optimal bandith/metric in one and bounding the contraction of the bellmen operators)."
