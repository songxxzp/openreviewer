The authors use kernel theory, Mercer\u2019s theorem in particular, to explain the adversarial examples. Specifically, the authors first prove that adversarial examples shift the Mercer\u2019s spectrum of the empirical kernel so that the near-zero density of the Mercer eigenvalues is high. Extending the first theorem, the authors also explain the reason for the denseness of adversarial examples, i.e., adversarial examples are unlikely to appear in the test set, but they exist near every test sample. Lastly, the authors demonstrate their findings with small experiments."

This limiting process effectively adds two equal samples to the training set with two different targets. I am under the impression that the vanishing of the eigenvalues is a consequence of this construction ($K(X,X)$ wouldn't be invertible) and is not associated with the robustness of the network.\n\n- Assuming that my understanding of the limiting process is correct, the paper has rediscovered the robustness-accuracy trade-off as depicted in [A] (this is not a critique exactly). Zhang et al. in [A] propose that adversarial examples and natural samples overlap in the input space and that is why we observe a trade-off between robustness and accuracy in adversarial training.

I think this is because the authors present the results in the most general and abstract way possible and also include the theorem proofs in the text, which makes the paper difficult to read for an average machine learning researcher. I suggest the authors postpone the proofs to an appendix and discuss some corollaries and examples of the theorems for some basic kernel functions. \n\n2- Theorem 1 is an asymptotic result and holds when the attack radius $\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0$. I think this could limit the implications of the theorem. Also, it seems that in Theorem 1 the bound on $\\epsilon$ in the limit statement depends on the choice of adversarial example $x'$ which means the asymptotic guarantee would not uniformly hold for all $\\epsilon\\le \\epsilon_0$ with $\\epsilon_0$ being independent of adversarial example $x'$.\n\n3- The definitions and notations in sections 2 and 3 are in some cases vague and raise questions: a) In the definition of adversarial examples, what is function $f(\\epsilon)$? The definition does not specify function $f$ and only states the condition $\\lim_{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0}f(\\epsilon) = \\infty$, which would be problematic because for a fixed $\\epsilon >0$  we can always find a function $f$ for observed data that makes the definition hold for a perturbed $x'$. Also, in the proofs of Theorem 1,2 do the authors determine the function $f$ based on the dataset $X, y$ or is the choice of $f$ independent of $X,y$? \n\nb) In Theorem 1, what is the definition of $P_{X'}$ (with the prime)? Is it the delta function on $x'$ or a continuous density function related to data distribution $P_X$? \n\nc) I wonder what the authors precisely mean when they say \"In the limit $\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0$, .... \" in Theorems 1,2. Does that mean there is an $\\epsilon_0 >0$ independent of the choice of $x'$ such that the statement holds for every $\\epsilon\\le \\epsilon_0$? (clarification on  weakness 2)\n\nd) As another question, what is the precise mathematical definition of \"such that $|| x- x'||\\le \\epsilon$ for some example $(x^*,y)\\sim p$\"? If $p$ is a continuous distribution, then every point in $p$'s sample space has zero probability so whether $(x^*,y)$ is in the support set of $p$ or not does not change its zero likelihood to be sampled from $p$. The theorem should explain this sentence."
