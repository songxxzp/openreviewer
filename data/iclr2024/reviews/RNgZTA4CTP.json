It's worth noting that my exposure to multi-agent settings is limited. Therefore, I would lean toward the inputs from other reviewers to assess the novelty as to how this work fits within the existing body of multi-agent literature.]\n\n\n1. The proofs have inaccuracies which impede a clear understanding of the underlying logic.\n\na.Lemma 2:\n\nthis line appears to be incorrect: \n\n$=\\gamma  P_i^*(s^\u2032|s, a_i)  \\max_{a_i^\u2032} (\\max_{a_{-i}^\u2032} Q(s^\u2032, a_i^\u2032 , a^\u2032_{-i} ) \u2212 Q^{k\u22121}(s^\u2032, a_i^\u2032 ))$\n\n: the $\\max_{a_i}$ cannot be factored out here since the maximum actions can be different for the two Q value terms inside the parenthesis and there is a minor sign. Apart from this, the remainder of the lemma appears to be correct.\n\nb.Lemma 3:\n\nIn the proof of Lemma 3, the second inequality appears to be valid. However, it seems to omit intermediate steps. The absence of these steps makes it challenging to follow the reasoning.\nElaborating on these steps would enhance the clarity of the proof.\n\nc.Lemma 4: \n\n\u201cSimilar to the proof of Lemma 2, we can easily prove $\\max_{a_{\u2212i}} Q(s, a_i, a_{\u2212i}) \\leq Q^k_i (s, a_i)$\u201d\n\nWhile the result seems valid, it may not be as straightforward as implied, especially considering the nuances in this context. In particular, the simplified operator incorporates an additional max operator (8), when compared to the operator (6) used in Lemma 2. A more detailed elaboration of the steps involved in this proof would be beneficial.\n\n2. As I will detail in the following, the conditions in the convergence proof for both operators seem too strong to hold in practice. There seems to be lack of sufficient attention to how these conditions might be met, thus leading to doubts around the practical relevance of the operators.\n\nBoth operators implicitly assume that the expectation w.r.t. the transition probabilities in (6, 7) can be computed exactly, at every step of the value update (i.e., $\\forall k$).\n\nAlthough the simplified operator is \u201csimpler\u201d due to not requiring the computation of expectations for every $\\tilde{P_i}$, it still poses practical challenges. The need to compute the expectation for even one $\\tilde{P_i}$ at every update step seems impractical.\n\nIn fact, an approximation error in computing the expectations, when combined with the max operation, could cause the over estimation of Q values. This issue, briefly mentioned in the text following Eq. (10), lacks a clear explanation in my opinion. \n\nThe approximation error would also lead to the violation of the Q value upper bound, undermining the convergence guarantees for both operators.\n\n**Suggestions for improvements:**\n\nPlease correct me if I\u2019m wrong in the above. If my understanding is correct, the authors might consider the following two ways to mitigate the concerns:\n\n1. revise the convergence analysis to account for the approximation error in computing the expectation\n2. modify the BQL algorithm such that the Q value estimates are both increasing and bounded above.\n\nMinor:\n- Many plots use \u201creward\u201d as the y-axis label. It should be \u201creturn\u201d instead."

It's a bit strange if the reward does not depend on the current state and the action chosen by the player. \n- Again, in the definition of $Q_i(s,a_i)$, what is the search space of $P_i(\\cdot|s,a_i)$? Do you search for \"all possible transitions probabilities\" from $(s,a_i)$?  If it is, then why not the solution simply be $Q_i(s,a_i)=r + \\max_{s', a_i'} Q_i(s', a_i')$? That is, the optimal solution of $P_i(\\cdot|s,a_i)$ should put all probability to the state $s'$ that has the highest value of $\\max_{a_i'}Q_i(s',a_i')$. \n- I have difficulty understanding the first inequality in the equation series in Lemma 2, i.e., the step that replaces $P_{\\text{env}}$ with $P_i^\\star$ with a $\\geq$ inequality. Can you explain that inequality? \n- I don't understand the following sentence in Page 5: \"As $P_i$ depends on $\\pi_{-i}$ and agents act deterministic policies, $D^m_i$ contains one $P_i$ under a deterministic $\\pi_{-i}$. \" I thought $D^m_i$ only contains tuples of the form $(s,a,r,s')$, why would it contain $P_i$? \n- In Page 5, it is said that \"When M is sufficiently large, given any $(s,a')$ pair, any $P_i(s,a_i)$ can be found in a replay buffer. \" I thought the set of $P_i(s,a_i)$ is infinitely large since these are continuous values, how is it possible that a finite set can contain all possible values of $P_i(s,a_i)$?  Again, it's unclear what you mean by $P_i(s,a_i)$ can be found in replay buffer, since replay buffer only contains $(s,a,r,s')$ tuples. \n- I don't understand the following sentence in page 5: \"Simplified best possible operator ... does not care about the relation between transition probabilities of different state-action pairs in the same buffer. \"\n- In Page 5, it is said that \"BQL ideally needs only $|A|$ buffers.. which is very efficient\" Suppose that every player has $K$ actions, is $|A|=K^N$? I'm not sure one can call this very efficient, given that this is exponentially large, and running a centralized Q-learning (so the number of joint action is K^N) should also just incur the same amount of computation."

BQL- is more realistic and still seems to outperform baselines, but it seems like the key ingredient to getting BQL- to work is ensuring enough exploration. It would be useful to compare how well BQL does based on how much exploration is allowed (e.g., by changing the distance of the initialization to an equilibrium). It would also be useful to talk about whether sufficient exploration is a realistic assumption in practice.\n- **No intuition for the 2-step update when the theoretical assumptions are broken:** The paper leans heavily on asymptotic intuitions, but a lot of the wins in 4.3 and 4.4 seem to come from sample efficiency. Is there any intuition for this? More generally, there seems to be a gap between theory and practice, esp., the improved performance of BQL when there is only a single replay buffer $\\mathcal{D}$. Are there any intuitions for why BQL works in this case?"

If so, what are the assumptions required? If not, what is the gap?\n1. How does the performance of BQL change as you modify the amount of exploration that is performed by the agents?"
