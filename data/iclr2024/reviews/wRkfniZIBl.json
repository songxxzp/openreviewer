Based on functional similarity between a) alternatively spliced RNA and b) homologous gene, the authors build positive sample pairs through these two similarities. A contrastive training objective adapted from SimCLR is then used to train an RNA encoder, along with projection modules. Experiments are conducted on 3 downstream tasks: 1) RNA half-life and 2) Mean ribosomal load and Gene ontology prediction by training a layer on top of frozen representation. The authors showed that their approach outperform other pretrained represrentations in these tasks and is especially effective in the low data regime."

Only three datasets are used, among which the performance on Gene ontology is only partially reported in the Appendix.\n    - What's the point of learning good RNA representations if all your downstream tasks can be solved with standard fine-tuning? In NLP, better sentence embedding can directly be used to amplify retrieval-based QA systems or retrieval-based text generation. But in your application, I do not see the better embeddings helping your downstream applications.\n    - If I understand correctly, the proposed method works comparably with `Saluki` in full fine-tuning while performing worse in linear probing than it. It also has more parameters than it. What is the benefit of your model over `Saluki`?\n    - How do you use the pre-trained DNA models to solve the RNA prediction tasks? Do you replace all the `U` with `T` and feed them to the DNA pre-trained models? If this is the case, the comparison between the contrastive training target and MLM/NTP is unfair since the models are trained on different corpus.\n    - If I understand correctly, the proposed model and `Saluki` utilize more information than the sequence itself. If this is true, then the comparison with the baselines is unfair.\n    - Why do you present the results on linear probing with models like RNA-FM, NT, and DNA-BERT2 while skipping them in the model fine-tuning? If they can generate embeddings for linear probing on the datasets, you should be able to fine-tune them on the tasks, too. The models, except for NT-2.5b, are not too large to be fine-tuned on consumer GPUs."
