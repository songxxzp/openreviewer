They define culture, however it is unclear if the definition they are working with is original. AI is not defined, but the examples offered stem from LLMs and chat-bots. The paper is well organized, but the number of references for a literature review are too sparse. AI appears to be narrowly defined around text and chat-based systems, especially given the wealth of prior work on automated decision systems, how they shape our culture and privilege. I would have also appreciated more recent results around the cultural effects of text-to-image generative models.\n\nThe authors propose a 4-point lens by which they can study the impact of AI on culture. Such a definition can certainly be useful, however it is not directly applied to any of the works reviewed. It is therefore difficult to determine the utility of such a definition if it hasn\u2019t been applied to even a few key examples."

Are they the same?\n- What is your working definition of AI, is it fixed or fluid? What is excluded from your definition?\n- Where is Culture in AI inapplicable?\n- You claim that there is a lack of variety among scientists, engineers and innovators, how do you define these groups? How do you determine homogenaity? What are the examples of group-think that you claim is anathemic to a broader cultural lens?\n- How does Culture in AI intersect with regional and linguistic normative values? What are some examples which illustrate how this 4-component definition surfaces this monolithic approach to technology?"

We can ask about culture in sociology-techinal systems or about how tools reflect the culture they are created for/by, but saying some set of matrices have a culture is not something I can believe. Maybe for some specific set of online learning algorithms it's a colourable argument, but most AI systems don't evolve over time. The humans running them change them over time, based on the human's culture, values, etc.\n\nI think that if the claim was less strong, and the term AI better defined then this could be a good paper. Reducing the anthropomorphize a bit more would also help, the language choice in section 3.1 I find troublingly overloaded."
