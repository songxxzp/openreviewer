First, the paper proposes a magnitude-based pruning algorithm, which randomly sets the non-diagonal weights of neural networks to zero according to a Bernoulli random variable. This is followed by a discretization approach and a matrix sketching approach to improve the dependency of the bounds on the number of trainable parameters. The main result is a generalization bound based on a compression approach. Experimental analysis is also included to verify the assumptions used in the analysis, and to verify the theoretical results."

If $\\gamma$ is large, then $\\hat{R}_\\gamma$ would be very large.\n\nTo make the high-probability bound in Theorem 5.2 meaningful, one needs to choose very large $\\epsilon_l,\\lambda_l$ and $p_l$. In this case, the generalization bound would also be large. Furthermore, Lemma B.5 requires $\\epsilon_l$ to be sufficiently small. This seems to lead to a contradiction.\n\nIn Theorem 5.2, the dependency of the generalization bound on $d$ seems to be $d^{3/4}$. If I understand correctly, if we do not use the matrix sketching, the dependency would be $d$. Therefore, the improvement is $d^{1/4}$, which seems not to be quite significant. As stated in the conclusion, the analysis still leads to a vacuous generalization bound.\n\nIn Lemma 5.1, the statement holds with probability $1-1/\\lambda_1-d^{-1/3}$. This dependency on $d$ is not appealing since it would require a very large $d$ to get a bound holding with large probability.

Furthermore, the authors introduce the concept of matrix sketching to reduce parameter size, leading to a more favorable bound. Empirical experiments support the authors' claims, showing that their bounds exceed test loss and outperform prior bounds.\n\nDespite the paper's overall significance and the intuitiveness of the generalization bound based on MBP sparsity, there are still notable shortcomings. The most substantial concern lies in the limited ability to validate the proposed bound's practical effectiveness. The assumptions made, particularly regarding the Gaussian distribution of weights, lack robust justification in the experimental context. Additionally, the graphical verification of the bound may not be entirely convincing, as the predicted error bound substantially exceeds the actual error. This raises questions about the bound's validity and practical utility. Rather than focusing solely on the bound, it would be more insightful to verify the underlying assumptions.\n\nTherefore, unfortunately, I cannot recommend an acceptance at the time being."

A more rigorous approach is necessary to establish the validity of the assumptions.\n3.

The empirical verification of bounds in Fig~3 displays bound values that are excessively large, impairing their practical utility.

The magnitude pruning algorithm assumed by the authors uses a Bernoulli based construction of the sparse mask, however, in practice magnitude pruning is done based on sorting the parameters in each layer (or the entire network). Does the $(j_r, j_c)$ structure in each layer hold then? For pruning methods like Iterative Magnitude Pruning, larger layers are known to have dead neurons (corresponding to all zeros in a row). This problem is especially amplified in a CNN where IMP sets most channels to zero while having very few dense channels. The current proof seems to be unable to handle these situations and how will the assumption change for CNNs.\n\n3. How will the generalization bounds change for different pruning methods, for eg: random pruning or other gradient based pruning criterions. Would random be strictly worse or similar? Insights on different pruning methods will help understand the relevance of the proposed bounds for different pruning criteria.\n\nThe key idea of the paper is novel and for the first time establishes generalization bounds for magnitude based pruning methods.\n\n[1] Arora, Sanjeev, et al. \"Stronger generalization bounds for deep nets via a compression approach.\" International Conference on Machine Learning."

(2) To bound the parameters of the pruned network, they argue that its weight matrices are sparse and thus can be compressed with a \u2018sparse matrix sketching approach\u2019 which basically allows recovering a sparse matrix X from a sketch AXB^T where A and B have many fewer rows than X.\n\nUnfortunately, I found the results in the paper difficult to grasp \u2014 little intuition is given for the bounds and most of the results have undefined quantities which make them impossible to interpret.

Again, see my detailed questions below but: (1) it is not clear what the improvement is from applying random matrix theory bounds instead of simple Frobenius norm bounds to bound the spectral norm of th erandom perturbation (2) sparse matrix sketching does not represent a sparse matrix X with any fewer parameters than a naive sparse matrix format would.

I starred points that I think are more important and would be helpful to have addressed during the author response period.\n\nQuestions/Comments:\n- The abstract is confusing as it seems to focus on ML in general. Never mentions the context \u2014 e.g. neural networks.\n- Overall, paper has lots of typos and grammatical errors. It would need significant proofing before final publication. The intro in particular is very vague and difficult to read. I could not understand from it what the paper was actually doing. E.g. what do you mean by sparse matrix sketching? From what I can tell, this is not a standard term and no citations are given in the intro when the term is introduced. Are you talking about random projection with sparse random matrices? Something else? How are you using this sparse matrix sketching? Is it an alternative to magnitude based pruning? A way of analyzing magnitude based pruning? Something else? Some of these questions become clearer later, but IMO the intro needs to be significantly reworked to be more concrete.\n- In 3.1, what is the different between R(M) and R_0(M). Both notations are used and both seem to mean the case when gamma = 0? I.e. no margin? \n-**  I didn\u2019t understand the role of the \u2018fixed string\u2019 s in Def 3.1. It is not used in either the definition of G_{A,s} nor in the definition of compressibility. It seems that dropping it would not change the definition nor Theorem 3.1 at all. So what is its role? Relatedly, G_A,s is defined differently in Def 3.1 and Thm 3.1, which I presume is a typo.\n- In Assumption 3.1, are the weights *independent* of each other? Or just marginally Gaussian but potentially correlated? (Later I see that independence is needed but this was not clear in the assumption)\n- In Remark 4.1, what is meant by \u2018diagonal elements\u2019 given that the weight matrices are not square.\n-** Given the explanation of the proof in 4.1, I\u2019m not clear on why an assumption of Gaussianity was needed. And I\u2019m not clear why randomized pruning was needed. As long as the original distribution was mean 0 and symmetric, if I just pruned all values below some threshold t, then Delta^l would have i.i.d. mean 0 entries with bounded moments right? And then random matrix theory results could be applied.\n- In Lemma 4.1, what is Gamma_l? I couldn\u2019t find where this was defined.\n- ** I also couldn\u2019t make intuitive sense of Lemma 4.1. I also don\u2019t see how the bound could possibly not depend on some norm bound for the original input points. Say I just have 1 layer and the non-linearity is actually just the linear function, then if I multiply my input by some arbitrarily large constant C, then x^L and hat x^L will also be multiplied by C and thus the error would be scaled by C. So in this case, the error bound must depend on the scaling of the input points.\n-** How does the error bound of Lemma 4.1 compared to the maximum size that ||x^L||_2 could be? Shouldn\u2019t this maximum size be roughly proportional to Product L_l ||A^l||_2. Thus, wouldn\u2019t this make the error bound very weak? As the error itself is large compared to ||x^L||_2?\n- Fig 1 \u2014 is Lemma B.5 meant to refer to Lemma 4.1?\n-** Where does the random matrix theory actually come in to Lemma 4.1? In particular, if I have a matrix with random mean 0 entries, then I can bound the spectral norm of that matrix trivially by the Frobenius norm, which by Markov\u2019s inequality is at most something like n*E[Var(random variable)] which good probability. Random matrix theory results improve this bound to something scaling more like \\sqrt{n}. If you instead used the trivial Frobenius norm bound, how would Lemma 4.1 change?\n- In Section 5 it was unclear of the Sparse Matrix Sketching idea was novel to this paper, or something from the literature? No citations are given.\n- **Say I have a p x p matrix with j*p nonzeros. Then to represent this matrix in sparse matrix format, I need j*p values for by non-zero entries, along with j*p indices indicating their positions. These indices take ~ log p bits each. Thus, I need roughly j*p*log p parameters to represent the whole matrix. I don\u2019t see how sparse matrix sketching is improving on this simple argument. In fact, since it compressed to a \\sqrt{jp}logp x \\sqrt{jp} log p sized dense matrix, it seems to lose a log factor since (\\sqrt{jp} log p)^2 = jp log^2 p parameters.\n- ** Related to the above question, an alternative bound based on a simple counting argument is given in Lemma D.1. The claim is that this bound is \u2018combinatorial\u2019. But it is not, given that {d_1 d_2 choose alpha} is in a log and thus bounded by roughly alpha*log(d_1 d_2).  I could not make sense of the bound of Theorem 5.2 enough to compare them but I couldn\u2019t understand why Lemma D.1 was obviously a worse bound. We should be able to bound the number of non-zero entries alpha directly using Lemma 5.1 by something like max(d_1,d_2)*max(j_r,j_c). Doing so looks like it would in fact give a stronger bound that Theorem 5.2\n- In Lemma 5.1, what is lambda_l? Without this being defined, it is impossible to interpret the theorem. E.g. we could have lambda_l = max(d_1,d_2). Also what roughly is Chi? \n- In Theorem 5.2, it says that d must be chosen to make some expression hold. However, that expression does not depend on d. So I don\u2019t understand what this is saying."
