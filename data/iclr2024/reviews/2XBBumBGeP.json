What is the difference and your contributions?\n\n(iii) The proposed method has some technical drawbacks.\n\n[1]  The normalizing flow-based framework requires a statistic, i.e., the mean of the specific normal distribution for the configuration c. This is a very strong priori condition. In real application, this statistic may not be given.\n\n[2] The proposed method is trained on SIDD, even the pre-trained denoiser. However, the noise distribution varies across different datasets (like DND, PloyU, Nam) since they are captured by different hardware. The training may make the noise generator overfit on the SIDD dataset and not fit well with other noise distributions. Then how to solve this issue? \n\n\n(iv) The experiments need to be improved.\n\n[1] Experiments on other noisy image datasets should be provided to resolve my concerns in (iii) [2].\n\n[2] The comparisons should also be improved. The metric KLD may not be suitable for noise generation. Why not follow the metric PSNR Gap in DANet or Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to measure the domain gap?\n\n[3] The adaptation now is conducted in a self-supervised manner. What about its performance in a fully supervised manner? And what about its performance on the SOTA denoising methods like Restormer? Since some noise generation methods like PNGAN can still improve the performance of Restormer.\n\n[4] The comparison between the proposed NAFlow and other SOTA noise generation algorithms should be added in the main paper, including DANet, PNGAN, GDANet, CycleISP, C2N, etc.\n\n(v) Reproducibility: The network and the method (Meta-train and Fast Adaptation) are pretty complicated. It is difficult for other researchers to reproduce the whole method. Since the code and models are not provided, the reproducibility cannot be checked."

                "value": "Despite being successful in learning noise from SIDD dataset, I find the noise being generated to be far from realistics. Modern cellphone cameras apply heavy denoising in the chrominance channel that chromatic noise is never visible. Examples shown throughout the paper (e.g. in figure 4) shows heavy chromatic noise. Further, SIDD dataset only contain images from 10 scenes, so there is not a lot of diversity in the data. This limits how much generalization we can expect to real world cameras. While this is largely a limitation of the SIDD dataset, I think it is very important for the author to acknowledge this point in their manuscript.\n\nAs an alternative, it may be interesting for the authors to look at other dataset. There is a technical report by Jaroensri et al. (\u201cGenerating Training Data for Denoising Real RGB Images via Camera Pipeline Simulation\u201d) that provides a dataset of raw-processed pairs that, in my opinion, is the most realistic among the raw-processed datasets available. The author should also consider applying processing from raw-only datasets such as those from Chen et al (\u201cLearning to See in the Dark\u201d) to achieve a more realistic noise distribution. Having included more dataset (especially in evaluation) could also be helpful in providing signal for generalization to the real world."
