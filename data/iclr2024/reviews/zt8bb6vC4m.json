About the linear assumption on $x_t^\\top \\eta$, can this be generalized to some non-linear function of $x_t$? Also, when $x_t$ is stochastic, can the assumption of $x_t^\\top \\eta>0$ be relaxed to $E[x_t^\\top \\eta]>0$, where $E[\\cdot]$ is the expectation over $x$?\n\n3.

As far as I know, Ban and Keskin (2021) is the first to consider the heterogenous price elasticities which are formulated to be linear with context. At least when introducing the formulation, I think the paper should be cited and discussed more.\n2.\tI understand that a known link function is a good starting point and a common practice. One direction that I think might further improve the paper is to consider (or at least discuss about) an unknown link function. The reason why I mention this point is that Fan et al. (2021) studies a problem with unknown noise distribution. According to equivalence of the two formulation, it seems that it is not undoable to consider a version without knowing the link function. \n3.\tAbout the Perturbation, similar ideas can be found in the dynamic pricing literature (see, e.g., Nambiar et al. 2019). From my perspective, the only reason why the time horizon $T$ should be known in advance is because we need it to calculate $\\Delta$. Nambiar et al. (2019) dynamically change the magnitude of the perturbation, which may potentially help the current algorithm to get rid of the known time horizon $T$. Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\nReference:\nGah-Yi Ban and N Bora Keskin. Personalized dynamic pricing with machine learning: High-dimensional features and heterogeneous elasticity.

The authors may want to discuss more the impact of introducing feature-dependent price elasticity terms on algorithm design as well as regret analysis. \n\nW3.
