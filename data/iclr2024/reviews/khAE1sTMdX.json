The rationale for this choice remains ambiguous. It is important to discuss how this approach compares to other vision-language fusion techniques such as CLIP[1] and other multi-modal recommendation systems like VIP5.\n- The necessity of the context reconstruction loss is still unclear to me. I wonder the detailed design of this loss item and why it can benefit alignment. And about the token-level reweighting, I think it is important to give more definitions/explanations of easy/hard tokens and how to distinguish.\n- In the evaluation part, it is crucial to offer clarity on the experimental settings. Some baseline models like MF and LightGCN operate differently from sequential models like S3Rec and BERT4Rec. Ensuring a clear distinction between these setups is essential to maintain fairness in comparisons.\n- The experiments utilize sub-datasets from the Amazon dataset, which might possess similar data distributions. This might limit the generalizability of the results. It would be informative to observe the recommendation model's performance, especially in scenarios of zero/few-shot recommendations, on diverse datasets with visual content.\n\n[1] Radford et al.
