This seems to suggest the more general theory does not give rise to diverse choices of $k_1$ and $k_2$ in applications.\n* Even if we only consider the case of $k_2 = f(d)k_1$, it remains a question of how to choose the scaling function $f(d)$. The paper suggests taking $f(d) = \\sqrt{d}$ or $\\ln(d)$, but further comparision (either empircal or theoretical) is lacking.\n* As discussed in Appendix C, h-KSD is not a valid discrepancy measure, which seems to suggest it is less useful as a metric than the vanilla KSD."

The paper suggests that the hybrid kernel is proposed as a solution to circumvent the issue of variance collapsing. Nonetheless, it should be noted that there are numerous preceding studies such as S-SVGD, Grassman SVGD, among others, addressing similar challenges. Some of these methods have successfully established a proper goodness-of-fit test, ensuring that the resultant discrepancy is a valid one.\nDespite this, I observed a lack of empirical evidence showcasing the hybrid kernel approach\u2019s advantages over these established methods. In light of this, could you please elucidate on the specific benefits and improvements of the hybrid kernel approach, be it from a theoretical or empirical standpoint?\n\nMy second concern revolves around the convergence properties of the h-SVGD algorithm. The manuscript demonstrates that the descent magnitude is h-KSD, which, as acknowledged, is not a proper discrepancy. This raises questions regarding the algorithm\u2019s capability to minimize the KL divergence effectively, specifically, whether it can drive the KL divergence to zero. A descent magnitude (h-KSD) of zero does not implies that the distributions are equal or that the KL divergence has been minimized to zero.\nThis brings us back to the previous point on the need for the hybrid kernel approach\u2019s advantages. It is good to understand how h-SVGD, with its unique convergence characteristics, stands out amidst other existing methodologies addressing similar issues."
