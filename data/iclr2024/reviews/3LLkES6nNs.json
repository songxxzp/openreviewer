They also derive recursions for the limiting covariance kernels for the two cases of weight tying. These recursions can be solved with a dynamic programming method by simply storing results for previously computed kernels for earlier layers and looking them up to compute later layer correlations. The authors show that temporally shared weights give rise to different kernels than temporally independent weights."

The ODE model with temporally constant weights focused on in this paper is not a new architecture but is really just a randomly connected recurrent RNN, which has been analyzed by physicists and theoretical neuroscientists for decades. In particular, this is exactly the Cristanti and Sompolinsky model of a RNN (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.259, https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.98.062120) without a leak term. Techniques like dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) can be used to calculate the large width limit of these dynamics and would recover identical dynamics for the covariances as the authors provide. Some other relevant papers are Helias & Dahmen book (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10416).  There are also prior works which solve the equations without non-stationary assumptions (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/e6f29fb27bb400f89f5584c175005679-Paper-Conference.pdf).\n\nThe authors should make contact with this literature and discuss a comparison with their derived limit and the limit for DMFT for random RNNs."

If so, this should be stated clearly somewhere. I think this is important because the scaling of beta with T should determine whether one gets the Log-Gaussian result of Li et al (beta ~ O(1) and L ~ N) or the SDE type limit Hayou and Yang beta ~ 1/sqrt{L}. Further the convergence result for preactivations should only hold in the shared weights case with U fixed and for a fixed realization of the weights W.   \n2. What is going on in eq 4? Not clear at all how this relates or what assumptions on A make this equation hold.\n3. Figure 2: why are the shared weight networks converge to their limit, but the non-shared networks do not converge to their limit? Is there any analysis of finite size error that would predict this? \n4. Figure 3: It is unclear to me if the smallest eigenvalue is the proper metric. Numerical stability of algorithms usually depends on some kind of normalized metric of smallest eigenvalue like condition number which compares largest to smallest eigenvalue. I am wondering if the shared weights has better condition number rather than just larger minimum eigenvalues. \n5. Why do the authors refer to this model as a Neural ODE rather than a RNN? My impression was that weight sharing across layers is what distinguished RNNs from standard feedforward networks. \n\n\nIf the authors could answer these questions and address the discuss the connection to random RNN models, I would consider raising my score."
