Possibly, the following $$Y \\perp (X_j, X_i) \\mid X_{-ji}, (E[Y \\mid X_j], E[Y\\mid X_i]) $$\n\nWithout connecting such a definition to the how you are using the knockoffs framework, I cannot trust a claim about FDR control.  I see a few things that could help, if the knockoff swap property holds, then real-real interactions and knockoff-real interactions also should satisfy the swap property. I think this should be shown but it seems believable.\n\nBut then it should be made clear that the flip property is satisfied for the interaction measures in some sense. Otherwise, the knockoff based selection would not provide FDR control. \n\nHappy to discuss further and increase score."
