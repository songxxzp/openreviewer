The problem and motivation that this work focuses are not so novel. \n- Many recent models do not require paired multimodal data for pre-training and fine-tuning. \n- Knowledge transfer from one modality to another is actively studied in many directions. \n- Unfortunately, the related work of this paper is largely cursory. \n- Many previous works have shown that the four modalities that this work considers \u2013 images, videos, point clouds and audio \u2013 are related enough to learn from one modality and help for another modality with no pairing. \n\n2. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is not sufficiently demonstrated in experiments. \n- The reported performance improvements are somewhat marginal over MAE as shown in Table 1 (i.e., mostly less than 1.0% in accuracy and at best <2.0%). \n- Overall, the proposed cross-modal re-parameterization seems reasonable, more thorough experimental supports may be required. \n- More supports include more baselines, other novel modalities, more performance gaps, etc, which can make this submission much stronger."

The author claims that incorporating the auxiliary modality would improve the model's performance on the target modality, even if there is no any relevance between the data. However, the reasoning behind this enhancement in performance remains unexplained. Furthermore, it cannot be confirmed that non-paired data is entirely unrelated, thus raising doubts about the validity of all related statements.\n\n2. In M2PT, numerous additional parameters were introduced, which could potentially account for the observed model improvement, rather than the inclusion of an auxiliary modality. The author didn't conduct any ablation experiments to investigate this."
