            "questions": {
                "value": "### Questions\n\n- In Table 1, are the antmaze results obtained by conditioning on the state or on images observations? I suspect this is the state. If I'm right, how did you adapt SSP and SFP, which are designed to work with images? Isn't this comparison unfair, since SSP and SFP, which are designed to work with images?\n- Still in Table 1, I was wondering why you did not compare to SpiRL and SpiRL-cl, which are defined in the same paper as SSP (SSP is a sort of ablation of SpiRL). After reading Appendix G, it happens that you did so, but the results speak less in favor of your method. This is somewhat unfair.\n- From the above 2 questions and remarks, my feeling is that to be fair, the main paper should have two tables like Table 1, one with learning from states and one with learning from images, where the separation of baselines and the environments all make sense. Eventually, if you don't have enough room, I think you could move all SSP results to an Appendix, as SSP is just an ablation of SPiRL. The fact that your method does not establish a new SOTA on all these results does not matter much, it has interesting enough features to deserve publication if properly presented.\n- In Table 3, SFP looks faster than SSP, whereas the paper seems to mention the contrary in several places. Can you clarify this?\n- Is Table 3 obtained when learning from images or from states?\nIn Table 1 (and/or 3 and/or 9), it would ne nice to specifiy the number of obtained skills with your methods and the baselines. If this is a hyper-parameter, this should be made clear too. \n- I did not find a list of hyper-parameters of your method. BTW, it would be nice to give a name to your method.\n \n- Section 4.2 could be made clearer. At first read, it is unclear whether you are (1) using RL \"from scratch\", (2) you are learning from a dataset of demonstrations or (3) something intermediate. My guess is that up to the first half of the second paragraph, you speak about (1). But then, after \"Moreover\", you speak about weaknesses of SFP and SSP in the context of (2), without proper articulation of the ideas. And the remark about SAC goes back to (1). Again, Figure 5 displays \"state visitation\" of your method, but if your method is learning from a dataset, this makes no sense. All this must be clarified, including the title of the section.\n- Note also at the end of the paragraph: \"the large error bars of our method are a result of an optimization failure\", we don't have pictures with error bars in the paper, just std info in some tables.\n\n### Local issues\n\n- Figs 1 and 3 are not much informative, particularly Fig. 1b is not readable\n\n- The first paragraph of Section 4.1 is more about related work than about experiment. I think you should have a more focused related work section (mostly the \"learning skills from demonstration\" part) where you can give more details about these methods and reject what is less relevant into an Appendix. Another approach is to have a \"Baselines\" section where you describe the baselines with enough details so as to make the point you made in this paragraph.\n\n- I appreciate the honesty of Appendix F, but it cast doubts on the validity of your results. As advocated in [1], if you don't have the compute to get statistically valid results, work on cheaper tasks :)\n[1] Patterson, A., Neumann, S., White, M., & White, A. (2023).

In Related Work, the section of \"Skill Learning from Interaction\" is also unnecessary because it is in parallel with your topic. \n\n2. About the observation distance-based score: Since it is complicated and lacks a theoretical explanation, more intuitive explanations or visualization is needed to illustrate this formula. In many domains with image observations, partial observations or complicated robotic tasks, the Euclidean distance in the observation space may not work.\n\n3. Soundness of experiments:\n- Lack a state-based baseline in Table 1 experiments, like SPiRL. SPiRL reaches a return of 2.9 [1] in Kitchen, which outperforms the proposed method a lot. It may also perform well in other environments.\n- Training curves of returns are usually required for RL experiments, which depict both performance and sample efficiency. However, this paper only presents the return at the end of training in Table 1, which can be doubtful due to the instability of RL algorithms. The data in Table 1 have large variance and are therefore unreliable.\n\n4. Lack the discussion of disadvantages of state-free skills: The paper emphasizes the generalization ability of state-free skills, but ignores its disadvanteges. State-free methods are inefficient on large datasets with diverse behaviors, since a large skill space is required to model all the behaviors. In this case, state-conditioned methods like SPiRL can model possible behaviors based on the state, thus providing a compact skill space. The paper also lacks such study on the influence of data diversity.\n\n[1] Accelerating Reinforcement Learning with Learned Skill Priors"

In action space clustering, the number of clusters is very small ( $2\\times d_{act}$ is less than 20 in AntMaze and Kitchen). Is this because the agent behavior in the dataset is not diverse? \nIf the dataset is large or collected by various stochastic policies, a small number of clusters can make the discretized actions unable to complete the task. In this case, do we need a number of tokens proportional to $2^{d_{act}}$?"

($N_{max}$ seems to have been varied across environments, per the appendix, so this would also be an interesting ablation).\n- The description of the type of data used in each environment is missing in the main text (it is present in the appendix). Given that the appendix mentions that the ant maze data consists of poor samples, whereas the kitchen data consists of nearly perfect demonstration, this design decision warrants an explanation/analysis in the main text.\n- There is some explanation in the appendix regarding the choice of vocabulary size for the different environments, but it is tied to the choice of data used for tokenisation.

Since distance-based merging entails knowledge of the environment in that we want agents to cover longer distances through their actions, is it fair to compare this approach with the other baselines (SSP/SFP/SAC)?\n- Why did the kitchen dataset consist of expert demonstrations, when the other datasets did not?\n- Did you perform any analysis/have any insights on the frequency of usage of each skill for a trained policy?"
