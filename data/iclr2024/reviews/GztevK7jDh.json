The approximation in Eq. (3) further assumes that each agent can determines its own subtask based on its local observation, which is not rational since effective subtask assignment requires global knowledge.\n\n(d) The novelty in algorithm design is a little limited, by introducing a subtask learner in QMIX. The subtask learner design is based on VQ-VAE, and the hypernetwork idea has also been adopted in QMIX.\n\n(e) QMIX itself has some drawbacks as it assumes that the global Q-value grows monotonically with individual ones.

Iqbal et al., \u201cActor-Attention-Critic for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\u201d, ICML 2019\n\n[2] T. Phan et al., \u201cVAST: Value Function Factorization with Variable Agent Sub-Teams\u201d, NeurIPS 2021\n\n[3] M. Wen et al., \"Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is A Sequence Modeling Problem\", NeurIPS 2022\n\n**Soundness**\n\nIn contrast to stated in the paper, general Dec-POMDPs have **stochastic** observations [4,5] and are therefore sampled from a distribution instead of being projected via a deterministic function. The benchmark domains used in the paper are all special cases with deterministic observations (and even initial states) thus do not reflect the general characteristics of a general Dec-POMDP [5].\n\n[4] F. Oliehoek et al., \"A Concise Introduction to Decentralized POMDPs\", 2016\n\n[5] X. Lyu et al., \"A Deeper Understanding of State-Based Critics in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\", AAAI 2022\n\nAccording to [4], the global state cannot be reconstructed from observations alone. However, in Dec-MDPs (a special case of Dec-POMDP), the reconstruction is possible. Thus, I am not sure about the general validity of the proposed approach.\n\n**Significance and Clarity**\n\nThe x-axes vary for different scenarios in Figures 3, 4, and 6 (either 2 million steps or 5 million), which is somewhat confusing. I wonder how the plots would look like, if the plots with only 2 million steps were run until 5 million steps as there could be a chance that the baselines outperform LSVQ in the long run.\n\nIn the maps `5m_vs_6m`, `MMM2`, and `27m_vs_30m`, QMIX performs worse than reported in the original introduction of the benchmark [7]. Furthermore, since the original SMAC authors consider SMAC to be outdated themselves [8], I suggest to evaluate on the newer SMACv2, which exhibits more stochasticity and better aligns with the general Dec-POMDP setting.\n\n[7] M. Samvelyan et al, \"The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge\", AAMAS 2019\n\n[8] B. Ellis et al., \"SMACv2: An Improved Benchmark for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\", 2022\n\n**Minor**\n\n- Some plots only show red and green lines. This is bad for colorblind readers who cannot distinguish between those lines. I suggest to change one of these colors to blue."

More experiments should be conducted to strengthen the quality of this paper.\n\n+ The performance on SMAC is saturated and the authors are suggested to supplement experimental results on SMAC v2.\n\n+ To compare LSVQ-QMIX with QMIX, the scale of the Q network in QMIX is enlarged to achieve a comparable parameter count with that of LSVQ-QMIX. In the reviewer's opinion, the scale of the LSVQ-QMIX ought to be shrinked rather than enlarging the scale of QMIX.\n\n+ In Figure 10, the results of LSVQ-QMIX against other baselines on GRF scenarios are not satisfactory compared with LDSA. Reasons for performance degradation should be analyzed and provided.\n\n+ In the context of decentralization, how to assign subtasks to a specific agent is not only related to the observations, but also related to the overall situation. For example, there exist two identical agents which can both do task A and task B. Under the settings of decentralization, the two agents will do the same task, while we want them to do these two tasks, respectively."
