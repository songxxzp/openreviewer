In Section 4, the authors say \"we split all nodes into a training (2/3 of all nodes) and a test set (1/3 of all nodes).\" Is this setting applied to all datasets? How to choose nodes for training? Why not use $K$-fold splits?\n\n2. In Section 6, Paragraph 2, the authors say \"we used the cosine distance and the Gaussian similarity kernel for $d$=128.\" Does it make sense to evaluate the models by $k$NN recall/accuracy, which is based on Euclidean distance?\n\n3. In Section 6, Paragraph 3, the authors say \"The number of epochs was set to 100.\" I think the number of epochs should be decided by the convergence of a model. The authors also say \"running CNE for more epochs and/or with higher $m$ could likely yield better results\" and \"be due to insufficient optimization length and/or $m$ value\" in the following paragraphs. Does this mean the models are not well-trained?\n\n4. In Section 3.2, the authors use CNE to denote the framework of [1], and the proposed contrastive learning model is named graph CNE. However, the CNE in Figure 4 and Table 2 seems to denote the proposed method, which is confusing.\n\n        [1] Damrich, Sebastian, et al. \"From t-SNE to UMAP with contrastive learning.\" The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations. 2022.\n\n5. In Table 2, are the baseline methods using the same experiment settings (for example, train/val/test split) as the proposed method?\n\n6. The authors claim that \"graph CNE performed comparably to the state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning algorithms.\" However, in Table 2, Local-GCL looks better. Please provide more evidence (for example, $t$-test) to support this sentence.\n\n7. Why not try GNN architecture if the authors want to compare the proposed graph CNE with other GCL methods?\n\n**Minors:**\n\n8. Why is Figure 1 shown on Page 1 but cited on Page 7?\n\n9. How are the hyperparameters decided?\n\n10. \".. where running CNE for more epochs and/or with higher $m$ could likely yield better results.\" Is the $m$ explained somewhere in this paper?"

This is asked because for Graph CNE, the paper mentions the reduction of dimensionality from D (input feature dimension) to d (2 or 128), and to my understanding, all the methods for graph layouts use only the structure/topology of the graph. If this is the case, I am still unsure if kNN classification accuracy is the right metric, since the metric quantifies local class separation, yet the class label for each node is unobserved by the layout methods. If this is the case, please justify the adoption of such a metric for comparing different graph layout algorithms. The concern is, what if for a real-world dataset, the class labels of nodes are less related or unrelated to the structure/topology of the graph? Then wouldn't all the layout methods show low accuracy? Fundamentally, the question is about the justification of using this metric to evaluate layout algorithms."
