It even manages to do a  good job at making the content available to an audience not very familiar with GPLVMs and Riemannian geometry, in spite of the tight page limitation. As stated in the text, in comparison to widely used solutions based on deep neural network architectures, the use of constrained statistical models like GPLVMs and GPHLVMs offers much higher data efficient while providing uncertainty quantification at the same time. The developed GPHLVM model is evaluated across three distinct types of human motion taxonomies, namely contact-aware whole-body pose sequences, hand-grasps and bimanual manipulation motions. The evaluation shows that the proposed model is able to better embed these taxonomies into a common latent space, while preserving the corresponding graph distances.\n\nOverall, the paper proposes a strong theoretical contribution with the introduction of the GPHLVM model, that can be applied for embedding hierarchical and graph-like structures."

These provide liberty regarding the application of the model, but also introduce a high number of hyperparameters.\n\nAnother weakness of the paper regards the presentation, as a large part of important material is provided outside of the main text, e.g. the comparison to VAE. This is understandable due to the tight page limitation. In fact, it seems that the paper would benefit from a having more pages available, I would better see it as a journal paper.\n\nAn important issue is the difference between the performance of the proposed model with respect to the base GPLVM model in the case of the constrained (non-vanilla) versions. It is difficult to judge if the improvement is significant or not. It seems that the introduction of distance preserving constraints greatly reduces the theoretical advantage of the hyperbolic structure of the latent space. To show if the differences in the stress is significant it should be made clear to what difference do they correspond in the observation space, either quantitatively or qualitatively. In fact, a comparison of the trajectories generated from GPHLVM and GPLVM should be included (no GPLVM based generation is provided, if I am not mistaken).\n\nRegarding the comparison with the baseline model, for fairness, the comparison should account for the difference in efficiency and computational complexity, which is quite significant as reported in Section F7. Regarding this comparison, please note that it would be preferable to move it to the main text, if possible."
