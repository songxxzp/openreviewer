As such, its actual performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms is unknown, since the above-listed algorithms all show that adaptive learning rates outperform standard SGD-M and Adam.\n* From Figures 2-3, it seems that MoMo tends to use small adaptive learning rates. This is in contrast to other methods such as AdaDelta (see [5] Fig. 2) or LipschitzLR (see [4] Fig. 3). Does this mean that in comparison, MoMo takes more iterations to reach an epsilon-ball of the minima? If so, does this mean MoMo is more computationally intensive?\n* Although the experiments were repeated 3-5 times, it does not appear that any statistical tests were used to verify the significance of the improvements.\n\n[1] Luo, Liangchen, et al. \"Adaptive gradient methods with dynamic bound of learning rate.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09843* (2019).\n\n[2] Zhou, Zhiming, et al. \"Adashift: Decorrelation and convergence of adaptive learning rate methods.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00143* (2018).\n\n[3] Yang, Liu, and Deng Cai. \"AdaDB: An adaptive gradient method with data-dependent bound.\" *Neurocomputing* 419 (2021): 183-189.\n\n[4] Yedida, Rahul, Snehanshu Saha, and  Tejas Prashanth. \"Lipschitzlr: Using theoretically computed adaptive  learning rates for fast convergence.\" *Applied Intelligence* 51 (2021): 1460-1478.\n\n[5] Zeiler, Matthew D. \"Adadelta: an adaptive learning rate method.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.5701* (2012).\n\n[6] Wu, Xiaoxia, Rachel Ward, and L\u00e9on Bottou. \"Wngrad: Learn the learning rate in gradient descent.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.02865* (2018)."

It is straightforward to perform training runs with linear learning rate decay. Waterfall decay schedules are also commonly used on CIFAR and other image classification tasks. It would make the paper significantly stronger if MoMo was shown to perform comparatively or better to these learning rate schedules. In addition, conducting an experiment in a different domain or at a larger scale would improve the significance and confidence in the results."

As mentioned in Remark 2.3, Momo methods require additional O(d) operations in **each iteration**. Please compare the total wall-clock running time of Momo methods and that of Adam or SGD. I suspect the additional operations in Momo will become a major computational overhead especially when the model size grows. \n\n3. There are too many versions of the proposed method, which can be overwhelming, and it's challenging to decide which one to choose. Please provide a simple and clear user guide. If I'm working on an NLP task, which version should I use, and what hyperparameters should I choose? If it's a CV task, which version should I use, and what hyperparameters should I choose? Especially, can the authors summarize the total hyperparameters? Right now there are too many notations and too many versions of Momo. It is hard to tell which are tunable hyperparam and which are not. It would be better if there is a clean summary."
