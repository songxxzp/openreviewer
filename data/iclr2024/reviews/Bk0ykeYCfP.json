                "value": "The paper intends to analyze the reinforcement learning manifold. However, the meaning is not evident from the text. Could you clarify what this entails and how the theoretical and empirical analyses relate to it?\n\nIn several sections, the paper mentions \"with reward\" and \"without reward.\" However, their exact meanings are unclear. Does \"without reward\" refer to imitation and inverse RL? Furthermore, \"without reward\" is commonly associated with unsupervised RL, where the agent does not receive a reward signal. Could you please provide clarification? It's crucial to maintain this distinction consistently throughout the paper.\n\nThroughout the paper, several instances of vague language make comprehension challenging. For instance, does \u201cthat focus on learning via emulating affect\u201d refer to imitation learning?\nAnd what exactly is meant by \"learning from exploration\"? Is it referring to regular reinforcement learning?\n\n\n\"Our paper is the first to focus on the adversarial vulnerabilities of deep neural policies that can learn without a reward function.\" Could you clarify how the proposed method learns without a reward function?\n\n\nThe related work is presented without clearly delineating how the current work differs or aligns with it. Providing these comparisons would enhance the related work section.\n\n\nWhile the paper references the general term \"deep reinforcement learning,\" the analysis primarily centers on Q-learning-based approaches. The examination of another form of algorithm, specifically policy gradient, is absent. I suggest the author specify the exact type of algorithm analyzed in the paper for clarity and completeness.\n\nThroughout the paper, I find it challenging to link the various Lemmas, Propositions, Corollaries, and their proofs to the central message of the paper. For instance, the purpose and significance of Lemma 3.1 (and its proof) remain unclear to me. The necessity and meaning behind Propositions 3.3 and 3.5 are also ambiguous. What is the intent of Definition 4.1? How does it relate to the main objective of the paper?\n\nThe caption for Table 1 is unclear and requires significant revision. Both Table 1 and Table 2 mention the tasks Pong and Seaquest, yet the results display three different games. How were these results derived?\n\n\u201cThe state-of-the-art imitation and inverse reinforcement learning policy is trained via the inverse Q-learning algorithm described in Section 2.\u201d However, I do not see this detailed in the paper. How can both imitation and IRL be trained via Q-learning? The explanation seems to be absent and unclear.\n\nFor Figure 1, which environment is being depicted? Is it an average of all three games (Seaquest, BeamRider, and Breakout)? The purpose and message of Figure 1 are unclear.\n\n\nOverall, the writing needs revision. It predominantly consists of lengthy sentences, making comprehension challenging. Addressing this by crafting shorter, simpler sentences would be beneficial.\n\nImplementation details appear to be missing in the paper. Which architecture is used to represent the policy? Which specific algorithms are utilized for IRL and imitation? Without these specifics, it's challenging to justify the performance presented.\n\nWhile the paper seems to concentrate on high-dimensional cases, how do the outcomes vary in a low-dimensional representation?"

The study starts from the formulation of theoretical analysis that shows learning from demonstration can produce lower robustness. In particular, the authors argue that perturbations can cause agents to transition into states where the generated reward from IRL and the states are not correlated, eventually decreasing the agent's robustness by making it not achieve optimal returns in the task of interest. The authors then formulated a way to generate perturbations that cause this highlighted problem and showed vanilla reinforcement learning algorithms yield a lower drop in returns compared to methods learning from expert demonstration."

I have not seen other works that establish theoretical analysis on the robustness of inverse reinforcement learning algorithms towards state perturbations.\n\n**Quality - Experiments**\n\nWhile I did not extensively check the theoretical contributions made in this paper, the experiments that empirically demonstrate the issues with the perturbations proposed in the earlier (theoretical) sections seem to be sound. It believe it empirically demonstrates the claim regarding the robustness issues of IRL methods.\n\n**Clarity**\n\nIn general, the paper is well-written. Despite having introduced plenty of theorems throughout the document, the authors did a good job outlining the role of each theorem in highlighting the weaknesses of IRL methods in terms of their robustness. Similarly, I found the experiments (and their analysis) were well written in terms of explaining the overall argument of the paper. \n\n**Significance**\n\nIn general, I find that the problem being tackled in this paper could provide highly valuable results for the broader ICLR community. Most reinforcement learning researchers would be highly concerned with the robustness of the policies they trained. While the theoretical analysis seems limited to inverse RL methods, it's still valuable knowledge that perhaps can spur further research in this area. At least, this paper provides the broader RL community with something to consider when choosing between vanilla RL and IRL from expert demonstrations."

The assumptions used for Proposition 3.5 are very strong. A potentially more general direction would be to study smooth Q-approximators in the case of Lipschitz MDPs.\n\n* Another weakness is that the authors do not offer no solutions to the problem of lack of robustness.

Could you clarify what you mean by \"Manifold setting\" in the introduction?\n\n3. Could you clarify what $\\phi$ stands for in the inverse Q-learning objective?\n\n4. Relating to the weaknesses, could you provide plots for the evolution of the performance of the IRL policy under adversarial and or perturbation setting in an online setting where it can perform X transitions?\n\n5. I am aware this might not be possible for the current time window. It would've been interesting see a comparison of the robustness of policies learned from expert demonstrations and those learned by ranking of trajectories. As the latter case covers sub-optimal states it can be a potential solution to the robustness problem. Could you add such experiments?"
