This is not clear to me, unless repetitions in S are allowed. Can the authors please explain this? Only a bound in one direction is immediate, as far as I can tell (which suffices for the main result of the paper). Also, the inequality in the definition is probably meant to be an equality (though only the inequality is clear to me, as I previously mentioned).\n- Lemma 2.2: I do not see why the \"immediate corollary\" is immediate. Can the authors please explain?\n\nMinor comments:\n- Section 1.1, 2nd paragraph typos: 1) \"Out gradient oracle...\"=Our; 2) Citing Dwork et al., Chan et al.: \\citep is more suitale than \\citet.\n- Section 1.1, 3rd paragraph arrives too early in my opinion. The authors discuss technicalities which are completely unclear at this point of the paper.\n- Preliminaries, Definition of $\\|\\nabla h(x)\\|_\\delta$: The infimum is of the norm over the set, currently miswritten as the set itself.\n- Differential privacy preliminaries: The authors should define Renyi divergence, and ref the two stated facts - \"then it is also...\", and \"ensures that \\Acal is ...-RDP\" (specifically cite the result, not the whole manuscript).\n- More generally, regarding the differential privacy preliminaries paragraph: it is not clearly explained how differential privacy relates to the stochastic optimization model, this is important and should be revised. e.g., \"two datasets Z,Z'\\in\\Zcal\", what is \\Zcal? It should be explained that this is the same z in the stochastic objective etc.\n- Equation in online learning (standard OSD regret bound) - add citation.\n- Lemma 2.2: Actually h does not need to be differentiable (it is automatically differentiable almost everywhere anyhow by Rademacher's theorem, which suffices for everything).\n- Section 2.1, 1st paragraph: \"... a low sensitivity gradient oracle from ...\", maybe should emphasize that this is a *stochastic* gradient oracle.\n- Section 3, paragraph second to last: \"as Lin et al. has proved...\" - As Lin et al. write before the proof of Lemma D.1, the lemma is actually taken from the paper \"An optimal algorithm for bandit and zero-order convex optimization with two-point feedback\" by Shamir [2017, Lemma 10], only restated by them. Hence this is a more appropriate reference.\n- Paragraph before Remark 4.1 includes a forward reference to Remark 4.1, maybe the remark should appear earlier? (I do not see a reason not to.)\n- Remark 4.2: I appreciate the authors adding an informal explanation about the Node function, though I found it hard to follow and I suggest revising it.\n- Proof after Corollary 4.4 - this is a proof of Theorem 4.3, right? Should clarify this."

                "value": "1. The reason to study differentially private (DP) zeroth-order methods for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization is not well motivated in this paper. I agree it is important to study DP nonconvex optimization, and there is indeed a rich literature that focuses on first-order methods. The paper mentions some applications of zeroth-order methods where gradients can be hard to obtain, including reinforcement learning. However, there is no notion of the dataset in these applications, then it is not immediate to incorporate DP. The paper should find some settings where DP zeroth-order algorithms are necessary. The current introduction looks like a simple combination of different concepts.\n\n2. The computation complexity is never reported and compared with existing DP first-order methods and non-DP zeroth-order methods. I guess it will be $d$ times worse since $d$ samples are required to construct the zeroth-order estimators, which could be bad when $d$ is large. I understand the need for $d$ samples to reduce the variance of DIFF, but why is it also used for GRAD? Also, the paper uses a two-point estimator for GRAD and a one-point estimator for each gradient in DIFF. Is there any specific reason for this difference in the choice?\n\n3. Is the assumption that $f(x,z)$ is differentiable required? I think Lipschitzness is enough in most nonsmooth nonconvex optimization literature, which implies the function is almost everywhere differentiable. Moreover, the main convergence results rely on the assumption that the domain of $\\mathcal{A}$ is bounded by $\\delta/T$. Projection is thus required to make sure this assumption is satisfied. However, as $\\delta/T$ is typically very small, such projection suggests that each update of $x$ only increases the magnitude of $x$ by at most $\\delta/T$ and every iterate remains in a ball with radius $\\delta$ centered at $x_1$ after $T$ updates. What if there is no stationary point in this ball? Does the convergence result still make sense? I guess it is then required that $\\delta$ should be sufficiently large, and the $(\\delta, \\epsilon)$-stationarity would be weak.\n\n4. I find it hard to parse Remark 4.2 and Theorem 4.3. What is the definition of $n_j$, $\\mathcal{X}^i$ and $\\mathcal{S}^{(i)}$? What is the need for the first index in the tuple of NODE? It is only required to sum the second index in NODE as per line 3 of Algorithm 5. I am also confused by the statement in Remark 4.2 that says NODE stores the largest node in each layer. NODE(7) and NODE(8) both have 3 layers, but one has 3 elements while the other only has 1 element.\n\n5. Minor: The standard results in $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP say something like $\\Vert \\nabla F\\Vert^2 \\leq \\sqrt{d\\log(1/\\delta)}/(n\\epsilon)$. Here, the dataset with size $n$ is given, and the best achievable rate given $n$ is studied. It might be good to also report such a rate following the standard since private data is not as many as one can collect and is assumed to be given in advance; The proposed method is a single-pass algorithm, but in machine learning practice, training tends to be in multiple epochs; In Section 2, $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP is used when introducing differential privacy. It might be good to change it to avoid confusion with $(\\delta, \\epsilon)$-stationarity."
