While I concur that there are easier benchmarks, there are also more challenging ones available. I view this work as an additional benchmark to the existing ones that involves a broader set of domains.\n- The paper appears to lack a dataset quality verification process. Moreover, it\u2019s not entirely clear how solving the benchmark (especially  MCAT or Law questions) would correlate with reasoning ability.\n- There are mixed approaches for evaluation.  Multiple-choice, numerical, and the simpler symbolic questions have automated evaluation, whereas the more complex symbolic and proof-based questions require human evaluation. The model-based evaluation is potentially beneficial, but on average, it incorrectly assigns or deducts points for 37% of the questions. This dependency on expert human evaluators limits the practicality of using this benchmark.\n\n[1] Arora, D., & Singh, H. G. (2023). Have LLMs Advanced Enough?
