Although it becomes clear after reading the entire section, the author should clarify this earlier.\n2. The section on \"Biomolecular Engineering\" in the related work part mainly discusses the significance of RNA design. I believe this content should be integrated into the introduction section rather than being placed under related work. Therefore, the organization of the article could be improved.\n3. I find the article lacks novelty; the core multi-level representation learning relies on self-supervised methods from computer vision, which is not novel.\n4. The baseline comparisons are incomplete. While the article compares some protein inverse folding methods, it fails to include recent protein inverse folding methods for comparison, such as ProteinMPNN and PiFold, which are mentioned in the related work section.\n5. The dataset used in the experiments is not publicly available, making it impossible to directly compare the results with those in previously published works.\n6. The author mentions collecting data to create a dataset, which is divided by sequence length. However, this approach is widely used in the protein domain and lacks innovation. Additionally, the author does not cite articles from the protein domain as references here.\n7. The author claims to have aggregated and cleaned data from RNAsolo and PDB to create a new benchmark. I find this innovation to be insufficient, and the author does not clearly indicate the limitations of existing datasets or what constitutes \"clean data\". The motivation behind creating this new benchmark is not convincingly explained."

They adapted the coordinate system from Ingraham, et. al. 2019 to model RNA instead of proteins. The application of contrastive losses at multiple levels (i.e. the cluster-level loss and the sample-level loss) is well-motivated. Additionally, the imposition of secondary-structure constraints via confidence sharpening is a good idea. The ablation study presented also provides good evidence to the usefulness of these additions.\n\n### Overall well-written with many details\n\nGenerally, the explanations were clear. Many details were included in the main text or in the supplement which made this paper straightforward to read and understand, which is very appreciated. There were only a few places which I found to be less clear, which will be detailed below. But overall, the clarity and presentation were very above par."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "### Lack of comparison against other RNA inverse-folding methods\n\nI consider this to be the most critical and crucial analysis that is missing. Although the paper does compare the proposed architecture (with its multi-level contrastive losses and secondary-structure loss) to other architectures like LSTMs or graph transformers, there aren\u2019t any comparisons to any other methods which directly tackle the RNA inverse-folding problem. There are _many_ such methods, including several that are as recent as this year (e.g. MCTS-RNA, LEARNA, aRNAque, eM2dRNAs, etc.). Not having these comparisons really holds this paper back, because there is no understanding of how this method (which is being presented as a RNA inverse-folding method) compares to any other RNA inverse-folding method.\n      \n### Performance metrics are somewhat limited or measure less important aspects\n\nAlthough there is some justification provided for the performance metrics focused on in the paper (i.e. recovery and Macro-F1), these metrics are still somewhat limited.\n\nRecovery is simply \u201caccuracy\u201d here, and although this is a great metric to report, some bases will naturally be harder than others to predict. For example, bases participating in certain secondary structures, or those that interact with other residues in the 3D structure, may be easier or harder to classify. Thus, instead of reporting recovery/accuracy pooled over the entire macromolecule, it would be useful to see these numbers stratified by different secondary structures or tertiary attributes.\n\nMacro-F1 is also not particularly clear. It summarizes precision and recall across the 4 different bases and averages them. Since the problem of inverse folding is effectively a classification problem, other more understandable metrics can be used, such as auROC and auPRC (or visualizing the ROC curve and PR curve across different methods). Again, these can be stratified by secondary structure or tertiary attributes.\n\nAdditionally, it would be useful to have a more systematic or global analysis of the accuracy of predicted secondary or tertiary structures. Figure 5 is very useful, but those are only a few examples. Having a more global analysis across the entire dataset would be very informative. \n\n### Potential leakage of RNA folds between training and test sets\n\nThe process of allocating the training/validation/test sets certainly took into account structural similarity by ensuring that different clusters of structures were allocated to entirely different sets. However, the clusters were generated pretty conservatively (i.e. TM score < 0.45, which is already a very low cut-off). This definition of clusters might be useful for contrastive learning, but it might still let a lot of similar structures to exist in both the training and test set. Instead of reusing the same clusters, it would be good to ensure that the TM scores between training/test sets are much more significantly different (compared to connected components of TM < 0.45), or splitting the training/test sets based on Rfam families to ensure distinct folds. An analysis that shows minimal cross-contamination of folds/structures/scaffolds between the training and test sets would help put this concern to rest.\n\n### Some minor areas to clear up in writing\n\n- The edge features should be $E\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times K\\times f_m}$\n- Equation 5 is not clear, and does not seem to match typical definitions of MPNNs; for example, it is unclear what the brackets mean and what $h_{E_{ij}}$ is doing on the left; also, it should be $\\mathcal{N}(i, K)$ (capital $K$)\n- Backwards quote around \u201creference\u201d in Section 3.4\n- In Section 3.4, the confidence scores $c_i$ are not used anywhere; are they equivalent to the model\u2019s output probability? It should also be clarified that $s_i$ in Equation 8 are the true sequence labels"

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Is there a constraint that makes the learned representations more evenly distributed on the hypersphere after projection? The supplement claims that having evenly distributed points on the hypersphere allows the model to better leverage a limited dataset. The projection to hypersphere space just normalizes the magnitude of the representations, but I don\u2019t see how that allows for the distribution of directions on the hypersphere to be uniform.\n\n- Are the dataset splits identical for all baselines?\n\n- Would sharpening confidence be helpful in non-paired residues, as well? It seems like that regularization was added to the paired residues, and the ablation study showed that it was helpful. Would it also be helpful if applied to all residues (not just the paired ones)?"

RNA structure prediction, for reasons that will be discussed, is studied much less than protein structure prediction. This discrepancy presents two major issues: Firstly, there are not enough high-quality RNA structures to build models from, and secondly, there are not as many methods developed to predict RNA structure. Therefore, the authors initially compile and refine a dataset, carefully dividing it into training and testing sets, and then develop new algorithms to address this problem. Since there are no existing methods to predict the RNA sequence from its structure, the authors not only propose a novel method \u2014 inspired from Ingraham _et al._ (2019) \u2014 but also introduce five baseline methods for comparison. Finally, they test their models on two significant, completely independent datasets: Rfam and RNA-Puzzles."

This necessitates the development of new encoding schemes.\n\n- The attention and care the authors have devoted to compiling a clean RNA structure dataset are noteworthy. The training and testing splits are carried out in a structurally-informed manner, which is crucial in structural biology. Additionally, they have maintained similar length distributions.\n\n- Given the limited availability of RNA structures, the authors employ a hierarchical representation learning scheme to address this challenge. This approach groups similar clusters together, much like protein fold families. They also utilize data augmentation by making slight alterations to RNA structures and ensuring their proximity in the latent space.\n\n- The ablation study is informative and serves to justify the modeling decisions made by the authors.\n\n- Impressively, the authors have also developed five baseline models."

            "questions": {
                "value": "I decided to move some of the perceived weaknesses to the questions:\n\n- The base atoms are masked; however, purines (R or A/G) and pyrimidines (Y or C/T) differ significantly in size, and the model could have simply learned to predict the base using the spacing between the backbone atoms of neighboring nucleotides. This is not as significant of an issue in proteins, as there are twenty different side chains that do not canonically pair with each other. One way to test this is to evaluate performance by converting all A/G nucleotides to R and all C/T nucleotides to Y, then report recovery scores based on R and Y only. If this score is substantially higher than the original one, then the model may simply be learning whether bases are purines or pyrimidines.\n\n- When constructing the neighborhood graph, wouldn't it be more intuitive to use a ball around each nucleotide? Could enforcing a fixed K result in some edges that are too distant in space?\n\n- Can't this method be iterative? That is, determine the primary sequence from the structure, then compute secondary and tertiary structures from the inferred primary sequence, identify discrepancies, and predict a new primary sequence, repeating this process until a certain condition is met.\n\n- Related to the previous question, is the \"recovery score\" the best metric? Is the goal to predict THE primary sequence or A primary sequence that gives rise to a very similar tertiary structure? Recovery scores, in general, tend to be low, and reporting predicted RMSD (e.g., using RhoFold) might be helpful in this regard.\n\n- RNA structure is not entirely rigid, and some techniques like NMR can capture an ensemble of structures. Would all such structures in the bundle get the same sequence?\n\n- Approximately 90% of RNA sequences are short (under 100 nt), and a Bayesian Optimization method might work well for this problem. It involves obtaining the tertiary structure, computing the secondary structure, starting with a random sequence, computing its secondary structure, and using the model to propose a new sequence until a close enough solution is found.\n\n- Can Cohen's Kappa be used instead of or in addition to Macro F1?"
