                "value": "This paper studies memorization in modern neural networks and aims to design a tractable approach to quantify the memorization of different training examples. Specifically, this paper considers loss curvature (averaged across different training epochs) with respect to a given training example as a memorization measure for that particular example. The paper leverages a finite step approximation of the per-example loss Hessian and explores the proposed curvature-based memorization score on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet, with ResNet18 as the underlying model architecture. Visualizing the examples with high curvature-based memorization scores, the authors observed that such examples correspond to long-tailed, mislabeled, or conflicting examples (e.g., duplicate examples with different labels). The paper also compared the curvature-based memorization score with Feldman and Zhang\u2019s stability-based memorization score and found a high correlation between the two scores. For a synthetic setup, where label noise is introduced to a fraction of training examples, the paper shows that noisy examples belong to the set of examples that receive the highest curvature-based memorization scores. Finally, the paper studies the average (over the entire dataset) curvature of per-example losses as training evolves. The paper shows that, during the overfitting phase of training, this average curvature shows a decreasing trend while the validation loss keeps increasing. The paper provides an explanation for this seemingly contradictory observation by arguing the decrease in the average curvature corresponds to the phase where training examples are already classified correctly and the model is increasing the margin of these examples. Thus, the paper highlights the importance of averaging the per-example loss curvature across entire training epochs to obtain an informative memorization score."

For example, the work of Feldman & Zhang calls those points to be memorized where the model only performs well when those points are present in the training set. What is the precise notion of memorization that this paper aims to capture?\n2) It appears that the paper claims that their curvature-based memorization score aligns well with Feldman & Zhang\u2019s memorization score as the two scores have a high correlation (cosine similarity). Such aggregate-level correlations can be misleading, especially while studying memorization behaviors which are very much tied to individual examples (e.g., see Section 3.5 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05337.pdf).\n3) Most of the experiments in the paper are tied to a single model. It would be interesting to see how the proposed curvature-based memorization score behaves as one changes model architecture and/or size. Are key takeaways from this paper robust to such variations?\n4) The paper claims that their proposed memorization score is significantly cheaper to compute compared to existing scores like Feldman & Zhang\u2019s memorization score (see a question on this below). However, it appears that the *efficient* loss curvature calculation follows from the prior work, limiting the technical novelty of the contributions.\n5) There is significant scope for improvement in the quality of the presentation. For instance\n\n* In Section 3.1, both $d$ and $D$ are used to represent the input dimension. \n* In the line after Eq. (2) $v_i$ represents the $i$-th coordinate of the random Rademacher vector $v$, while in Eq (3), $v_i$ represents $i$ random *vector*. Also, the line after Eq. (3) refers to $v$ as a Rademacher *variable* instead of *vector* (a similar issue in Section 3.2). \n* In Eq. (4), please consider using $\\approx$ instead of $=$. \n* In Eq. (6), please make the dependence of the square norm on indices $i$ (via $v_i$) and $t$ (via $W_t$) explicit.\n* In Section 3.2, O(n) \u2192 O(nT) forward and backward passes?\n\nBesides the issues mentioned above, multiple sentences in the paper require paraphrasing as their meaning is not entirely clear, and thorough proofreading is required to eliminate various typos."

Why is it **only** 3x more expensive when computing FZ scores requires training a large number of models?\n4) In Section 4.3, the authors mention ``...We recommend that curvature analysis should be used in conjunction with other checks, for a holistic view of dataset integrity. ``.

                "value": "This paper proposes a metric to identify memorized points. The proposed method utilizes the average curvature of the loss function with respect to the input and argues that memorized points have a higher curvature score. They demonstrate this by adding label noise to the training dataset and training until overfitting, showing a higher curvature score for these points during training. They also illustrate quite a high cosine similarity between their score and the previous method by Feldman & Zhang (2020), which they call the FZ score in the paper. However, the advantage of their method is that they don't have to train as many models as required by the FZ method, demonstrating computational benefits."

They have tried to justify their observations and conclusions by designing experiments. Different kinds of datasets are used in this paper, each of which helps to better understand the paper.\n\nIn general, I am leaning towards accepting the paper, and I am even open to reconsider my initial score upon improving the quality of the paper regarding the presentation and clarification of questions and points mentioned in the following."

                "value": "1. Toy example in section 4.4: The number of training points is far less than in the test set, which is not a similar case to your image datasets. The training data does not have enough points to accurately represent the underlying distribution. Additionally, adding noise to it makes it more challenging for the model to learn the decision boundary correctly.\n2. Section 4.4: It is a lengthy section and difficult to follow the main points of it; the presentation format can be improved.\n3. Figure 4: It would be better to display mislabeled examples side by side.\n4. Figure 5: The labels on the axes of the figure are not clear, and I can't interpret the results. Having a distribution over the corrupted samples would be more informative.\n5. Tables: MEAN+STD missing in the tables. \n6. Appendix F: It does not explain any correlation between memorized sampel by FZ and your method."

Table 2: Did you use weight decay for other methods as well? Can you show the result of FZ method?\n4. Section 4.3: Can you elaborate on why ROC curves are more reliable?\n5. How is the threshold for the curvature of loss selected?\n6. Does averaging the curvature over epochs remove the specific epoch signals? Isn't it better to study the difference between curvature evolution during time than taking an average?\n7. Figure 8: Which type of sample triggers the peak in curvature, and do memorized points contribute more to that?\n8. Figure 8: Why is the curvature of test points much higher than memorized points in CIFAR-100? And why don't we see that in ImageNet?\n9. End of page 8: What does the sensitivity of test samples to perturbation mean?\n10. Have any studies explored using the curvature of samples for inference attacks?"
