Is there any limit to varying the width?\n- Line 3: \u201cTrain above small-width models\u201d reads as the width varied in line 2 should be small. So stating it clearly in Line 2 would help readers to understand the whole algorithm.\n\nOther questions:\n- In Figure 4, the training loss at 7k and 10k of different sizes of models are shown. 7k and 10k iterations are very early stages of 26B and 52B models. What about the loss prediction accuracy for longer training steps(eg, 20k or more)?  \n\n- The author should put the loss prediction values(with multiple fitting and std included) and ground truth into a table and display in the main paper.

                "value": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on various tasks, with models getting increasingly larger. However, training such large models is computationally expensive. Recent work has explored scaling up data size rather than just model size, showing performance gains with smaller models trained on more data (Chinchilla). The goal of this paper is to introduce nanoLM, a benchmark for cost-effective LLM research within limited compute budgets. Larger LLMs like Meta's LLAMA require upwards of 1.7 million GPU hours and hundreds of billions of tokens to pre-train, using model parallelism.\nAuthors rely on \u03bcP and \u03bcScaling, which are methods for transferring hyperparameters (HPs) when scaling up model size. \u03bcP is a zero-shot transferring function for certain HPs like learning rate and initialization variance when changing model width. \u03bcScaling complements \u03bcP by fitting a power-law function to predict the loss L' that could be achieved by training a larger model M' with width w' and HP H', without directly training M'. \nTogether, \u03bcP and \u03bcScaling allow extrapolating language models from small to large scale without expensive direct training, by predicting the optimal HPs and loss for larger models based on results from smaller models. This enables more efficient study of how model structure and non-\u03bcTransferable parameters affect large-scale LMs.\nAuthors then introduce the NanoLM benchmark for computing the loss of the different models with varying sizes. NanoLM allows comparing different LLM architectures by predicting their training loss, without having to do full training. It supports common architectures like GPT, BERT, and T5. Experiments validate nanoLM's ability to accurately predict loss for large models (26B-52B parameters) by fitting small models (38M-3.4B parameters), using just 13-14% of the total pre-training cost. They also include other empirical evaluations of the released benchmark. Finally, the authors release curated pre-training datasets with 100B to 2T tokens covering various domains. All code and datasets are open-sourced.\n\nOverall this is a potentially high impact paper since releasing benchmarking datasets is always a great addition to the field. However, I think there is some analysis missing on comparison of their work with other similar papers such as  [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01373.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14322.pdf].
