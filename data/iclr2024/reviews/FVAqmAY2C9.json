However, the EMD computation in GEMD-M is entangled and unsuited for GPU calculations. In contrast, GEMD-T introduces learnable orthogonal matrices to achieve parameterized learning of EMD and resolves the entanglement in calculations. Experimental results show that the GEMD method outperforms existing methods on cross-domain few-shot datasets such as Meta-dataset."
