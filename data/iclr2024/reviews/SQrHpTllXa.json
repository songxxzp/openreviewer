The experiment results would be more conclusive if evaluated on large-scale datasets. To this end, the authors also should provide analysis on the runtime and memory complexities of their work, since M/B parameter LLMs may not be scalable for training time."

The authors state that the approaches considering all the tables have too much noise when generating the answer, while approaches selecting a part of the table before answering might remove the relevant parts. The authors thus propose to estimate the relevance of each token based on a clustering approach with latent variable (Srivastava and Sutton, 2017), coupled with two custom losses (sparsity of the relevance cluster and distance between the centroids). They combine this token relevance score with a predictor of a table \"cell relevance\" based on a sequence-to-sequence model that outputs the relevant cells from a full table. \n\nResults reported on the main table QA datasets (WikiTableQuestion, FeTaQa, and WikiSQL) show a noticeable improvement (e.g. gaining 3 points in accuracy compared to a LLM/Codex prompting approach that select subtables, DATER, on WikiTQ). Experiments consisting in perturbing the tables (adding rows, column/row permutation, cell replacement) show that the method is more robust than OmniTAB and ReasTAP. Finally,"
