With these investigations, the method finally achieved sufficient performance in some language pairs.

Although there are several differences, some prior studies try to transcribe unseen languages with seen language ASR systems (e.g., Hasegawa-Johnson, Mark A., et al. \"ASR for under-resourced languages from probabilistic transcription.\" IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing 25.1 (2016): 50-63.)."

I think that this part makes the paper's scope narrow.\n- Section 4.1 \"(iii) converting characters into the Latin token set via unidecode3 package; characters failing the conversion were discarded from the text\": Can you describe the examples? Also, I'm concerned that if we discard some characters in the reference, we cannot evaluate the performance validly with the other reports. Can you clarify this part?\n- Section 5.7: It is difficult to conclude since they are very different to compare (e.g., I'm not sure which one is more difficult using 800h of labeled German data and 60k hours of unlabeled English data). Can you explain the benefits of your method more clearly?\n\nOther suggestions\n- For me, the method is a little bit over-claimed since this method is primarily applicable to languages with the same scripts or with transliteration systems. It would not be easy to apply this method to the ideogram languages (e.g., Chinese and Japanese, although they are rich-resource languages, and we can build ASR systems easily). I think the paper requires some discussion about it (e.g., adding it to the DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS section?).\n- Section 2.2: $(\\alpha > 0)$ suddenly appears. This should be shown around Eq. (1), where $\\alpha$ first appears.\n- Section 4, first paragraph: These experimental setups are difficult to follow, as they are very diverse. I recommend you describe the design of the experiment (or the intention of what you want to show) when you describe each experimental setup.\n- Figure 3 is too small... Please improve it."
