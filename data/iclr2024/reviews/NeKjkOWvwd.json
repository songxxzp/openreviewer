                "value": "The paper address the important issue of distribution shift fragility/robustness in image classification, using image frequency analysis. The paper proposes computing Shapley values to quantify how much different image frequency bands contribute to model predictions, and uses this analysis on the training data to determine which frequency bands are most useful for classification for each class. The paper then introduces Class-wise Frequency Augmentation: for each training image, amplify the frequency components that are most predictive of that class. This encourages the model to prioritize these more predictive frequency features during training, and empirically aids in OoD robustness (without making any changes to the images at test time)."

                "value": "I have a lot of uncertainty about the method and evaluation, that I think needs to be resolved by improving the exposition before publication. My comments/questions are split roughly into more substantial vs more minor. I'll put my more substantial questions/concerns in this section, and my more minor questions/suggestions in the \"Questions\" box.\n\n- The introduction includes a lot of discussion of related work, and doesn\u2019t describe the contributions of the paper very clearly until the bullet-point list. I would suggest separating this into two sections, one that is a clear and direct introduction of the paper, focusing on your specific contributions, and a separate section covering related work that explains how the current paper fits into the context of the literature.\n- A large portion of the paper is spent describing the difference between \u201cdiversity shift\u201d and \u201ccorrelation shift\u201d, but I\u2019m not convinced that this is actually relevant to the proposed method and contribution. My impression from the paper is that some augmentation strategies help only with either one or the other type of distribution shift, but the proposed method helps with both. However, since the proposed method doesn\u2019t directly use anything relating to diversity or correlation shift, I would encourage the authors to avoid spending so much time describing it (or omit it entirely); as a reader I found it confusing and a bit distracting. \n- It\u2019s not clear to me how the frequencies are divided into the \u201cbuckets\u201d shown e.g. in Figure 5\u2014in particular, images have frequencies in 2D but the figures show a single frequency so I wonder how this maps onto 2D. More importantly: I\u2019m also not entirely sure for the Class-wise Frequency Augmentation if the added and subtracted frequency components themselves are derived from an average over training images, or the method is amplifying and suppressing components of that test image only, but deciding which components to amplify or suppress based on training images.\n- The theoretical analysis is billed as a proof of correctness for the proposed CFA method, but the theoretical model looks like it\u2019s a linear prediction that would be quite far from the nonlinear neural nets used in practice. The analysis is still valuable to gain intuition, but I would recommend explaining a bit more about the assumptions behind it and treating it as an illustrative toy setting rather than a full proof of the practical algorithm.\n- I don\u2019t understand the difference between Table 1 and Table 2. There are some slight differences in which methods are compared, and the numbers are slightly different, but I don\u2019t know why. If the differences are important then they should be explained more clearly (Table 1 is billed as an \u201cablation study\u201d but this should be described more), especially why the final full-method numbers are different between the two tables. My primary concern here is that these final results differ between the two tables, which makes me question either the trustworthiness of the results or at least my understanding of them.\n- Equations 5 and 6: f and F should be defined. I would guess that f is somehow the model output, but it\u2019s not clear if this is logits, probabilities, top-class prediction, etc. This kind of detail is necessary for others to be able to reproduce and build on the proposed method."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Minor suggestions/questions:\n- The abstract says \u201cwe introduce frequency-based analysis into the study of OoD generalization for images\u201d, which makes it sound like this is the first paper to take a frequency perspective on OoD robustness\u2014though this is not the case. For example, a few papers in this area are: https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/hash/b05b57f6add810d3b7490866d74c0053-Abstract.html, https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06349, https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/48736dba3b8d933fabbfdb4f22a7be71-Abstract-Conference.html\n- There are frequent typos and minor grammatical issues; please copy edit the final version of the paper. For example, in many places (including both text and figures) Shapley is misspelled as \u201cShapely\u201d. Another example is in section 6 where the C in CNN is written as \u201cconvectional\u201d rather than convolutional.\n- Some terms need to be defined (or removed if not important). For example, in the large paragraph on page 2, the term \u201cmissingness\u201d and \u201cdomain\u201d are not very clear; I can guess what you mean but it would be better if it were clear. Likewise when describing the \u201cappealing properties\u201d of the Shapley value as a metric, it\u2019s not clear yet what task you are hoping to use Shapley values for, and therefore not clear why these properties are appealing. Another instance of a similar lack of context/clarity is in the third contribution bullet point, which uses the words \u201call\u201d and \u201cboth\u201d without explaining what these are referring to. Another example is some acronyms; I know ERM but it should still be defined, as should RSC and IRM. \n- In equation 2, do you use the same random subset m in all the experiments, or is it chosen randomly each time?\n- Around equations 3 and 4, it would be good to explicitly define u and v as spatial coordinates and m and n as frequency coordinates.\n- It would be good to give some more description of the datasets that were used in the experiments, particularly how many train and test images, how large each image is, and how many classes there are.\n- Is the \u201cmodified image\u201d in Figure 6 an actual result of the inverse Fourier Transform, or just an illustration? It looks like just the edges of the input image, which I doubt would appear naturally as a result of the CFA method, but it would be good to specify if this is just an illustration (or even better to show an actual image resulting from the method)."
