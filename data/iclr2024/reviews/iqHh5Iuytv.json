                "value": "The focus of the present paper is on attractor networks, a special kind of recurrent neural network whose dynamics converge to a fixed point, or more generally towards a stable pattern within a fixed manifold. While attractor networks are prevalent tools in neurosciences and more generally in machine learning owing to their memory and computational properties, they suffer from instability upon changing one or several of their parameters, which impedes gradient-based learning in such models. The present paper proposes an existing theoretical framework to systematically address this problem (invariant continuous attractor manifold theory) and proposes a set of simple experiments to validate the relevance of this framework. More precisely:\n\n- The introduction introduces a simple class of RNNs (Eq. 1) of which two classes can be derived in dimension 2: the UBLA model and the BLA model. The UBLA model exhibits a half line in the positive quadrant of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ as a stable manifold (i.e. continuously made up of fixed points) while the BLA model has a bounded line in the same quadrant as a stable manifold. The stable manifold of the former can break upon changing the weights in some way, while the stable manifold of the latter model is more stable. This poses the question of how stable learning (in the sense of preserving the topology of these stable manifolds) can be achieved in these models.\n\n- Section 2.1 introduces Theorem 1, an existing theorem which, heuristically speaking, states that if the stable / invariant manifold of the model is initially bounded and smooth, then it may not change upon small perturbations. The slightly perturbed manifold is called a \"slow manifold\". In the light of this theorem, we may understand why UBLA (whose stable manifold is unbounded) is unstable upon weight nudging, while BLA is.\n\n- Section 2.2 discusses implications on ML, and in particular that models not satisfying Theorem 1 (e.g. UBLA) exhibit exploding gradients. For models satisfying Theorem 1 (e.g. BLA), it is suggested that loss gradients could act as \"restorative forces\" to counteract the deformation of the stable manifold. This idea is empirically investigated later in the paper.\n\n- Section 2.3 discusses implication on neurosciences.\n\n- Section 3.1 presents the first experiment which is the linear temporal integration task. In this setting, the RNN processes a sequence of pair of stochastic clicks and is learnt to predict the time-cumulated difference between the clicks. Therefore the RNNs under investigation operate in two dimensions and three kinds of RNNs are studied: the identity RNN (Id), and the UBLA and BLA model previously introduced. Fig. 3, along with the text, states the main findings. 1/ when deterministically perturbing a single entry of the recurrent weight matrix of these models, UBLA and Id can diverge (i.e. the loss diverges upon running the temporal dynamics) while BLA remains stable (B), 2/ when starting from the model optimum and adding a single noisy weight perturbation to the models, gradient descent maintains the model near optimum (E), yet often to a suboptimal solution (F), 3/ BLA exhibits some advantages in terms of stability, 4/ \"in practice, it is difficult to maintain any of the continuous attractors\".\n\n- Section 3.2 presents similar experiments but in polar coordinates, with the same integration task but on this circle. Two models are considered, one whose stable manifolds are the origin and the unit circle, another one where the stable manifold is boundary less. However, results aren't presented on this model.\n\n- The conclusion is somewhat negative : 1/ \"the homeostatic restoration of continuous attractor [through gradient signal] may be challenging\", 2/ \"further researcher on finding restorative learning for larger perturbations in the parameter space is needed\"."

In contrast, unbounded line attractors can become divergent systems when subjected to specific perturbations, leading to exploding gradients.

                "value": "1. First off, it's important to note that, as demonstrated in the study by Mikhaeil et al. (2022), when dealing with chaotic or unstable dynamics, gradients will always explode and **this issue cannot be solved by RNN architectural design or regularization and needs to be addressed in the training process**. So, the authors should consider this more precisely.\n\n2. The paper primarily focuses on a specific RNN variant, employing the ReLU activation function, 2-dimensional RNNs with specific parameter values outlined in equations (9) and (10). This specificity may limit the generalizability of its findings to higher dimensions, other architectural designs, and parameter configurations. In one particular parameter setting, the RNN exhibits 'well-behaved' dynamics, converging to a fixed point with bounded loss gradients. In such cases, established solutions (e.g., Hochreiter & Schmidhuber 1997; Schmidt et al., 2021) can be employed to prevent gradient vanishing. While this result is interesting, it's essential to recognize that it represents only one specific scenario and may not cover the broader spectrum of possibilities.\n\n3. Utilizing Fenichel\u2019s invariant manifold theorem, the authors established a sufficient condition to ensure that RNNs implementing continuous attractors remain immune to exploding gradients. However, pleae note that a ReLU RNN, discrete- or continuous-time, is a piesewise linear (PWL) dynamical system, a subclass of piesewise smooth (PWS) dynamical systems, that is smooth everywhere except on some boundaries separating regions of smooth behavior. These boundaries, called switching manifolds or borders, divide the phase space into countably many regions. Many existing theories of smooth DS do not extend to PWS systems. In PWS systems the interaction of invariant sets with switching manifolds often gives rise to bifurcations, known as discontinuity-induced bifurcations, which are not observed in smooth systems. Moreover, in the PWS setting, for bifurcations containing non-hyperbolic fixed points, similar slow (center) manifold approaches can be applied, but only to part of phase space. However, bifurcations involving switching manifolds cannot be examined in the same manner, as there is no slow (center) manifold. Consequently, the applicability of Fenichel\u2019s invariant manifold theorem to different parameter settings of the considered system (eq. (7)) may be limited or pose considerable challenges.\n\n4. Regarding the link between bifurcations and EVGP during training, it is essential to consider additional relevant literature. For instance, as demonstrated in (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17561.pdf) specific bifurcations in ReLU-based RNNs are always associated with EVGP during training."
