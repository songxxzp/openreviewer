                "value": "The paper addresses the challenges faced when using the AdaGrad optimizer in training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). While adaptive learning rate optimization algorithms have significantly improved DNN training, AdaGrad often underperforms compared to newer optimizers like Adam, RAdam, and Adabelief. The paper identifies two primary reasons for AdaGrad's limitations: the decreasing updating delta and the unfavorable performance of decoupled weight decay regularization. The authors highlight a common mistake in using AdaGrad with an additional learning rate schedule, which negatively impacts its performance. To address this, the paper introduces a Learning Rate Re-scheduling (LRR) method for AdaGrad, aiming to improve its performance and make decoupled weight decay regularization more effective. The LRR method can also be applied to other AdaGrad-type algorithms, and experimental results support its effectiveness."

The introduction of the Learning Rate Re-scheduling method offers a fresh perspective on improving AdaGrad's performance.\n2. The LRR method's compatibility with other AdaGrad-type algorithms increases its potential impact in the deep learning community. The performance improvement over the baseline adagrad and shampoo looks impressive."

The paper assumes that most practitioners add an additional learning rate schedule to AdaGrad, which might not be universally true.\n2. The performance over other more popular optimizers (e.g., SGD and ADAM), are not significant. Thus motivation should be more solid, why we need a new adagrad over the other choices.\n3. Reproducibility: There's no code provided in the supplemental materials, which is crucial for evaluating this paper that emphasize \"practice\" for multiple times and targets for higher performance."

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09018] which the authors cite, actually uses a moving average for  L and R, though this is not clear from the equations in the paper. In the appendix, Algorithm II shows that they use a moving average. This fixes the sqrt(t) issue addressed in the current work. They also use the decoupled weight decay, and should essentially achieve the same performance as the ShampooW proposed in the current work. This paper in 2020 is referenced by some more recent work on Shampoo, which follow the same practice. In light of this previous work, it doesn't seem like the proposed method adds any practical benefit to the existing versions of Shampoo. Also, there is no strong reason to believe that AdaGradW adds any practical benefit over AdamW as well."
