This paper rightfully uses impedance control for contact rich tasks. The actions are represented by a combination of target position and also the stiffness vector along each axis. In my opinion using admittance control is extremely important for this contact rich task. Without admittance control, none of the prompting matters. The prompt has a task description in plain English, list of functions along with their params, hints, spatial patterns (which I have not seen to be used in the example prompts), and some examples to show how to use particular functions specially the admittance control functions. In general, I think this paper is a step in the right direction but has its limitations."

On the other hand, it is known that impedance control is crucial for contact-rich tasks. \n- Even though the paper emphasizes on continuous aspect of the prediction, there is not much continuous quantities going on in the predicted codes. The values of floats in the generated code does not have much variation. The paper gives the impression that it can predict full range of continuous values but in the examples the continuous values can be looked at as a value drawn from a very small set such as `{0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.001}`. \n- The part that really needs continuous value is abstracted away as `pose(1)` and the model just apply relative transforms to that. If `pose(1)` is chosen close to the final poses, the LLM does not need to do much to accomplish the task. It would help if the paper reports the distribution of `pose(1)` distance to the final target poses.\n- Not all the prompt categories are used in the example prompt. I am particularly interested to see a prompt that uses Spatial Patterns. I also believe that this is a simplistic prompt. The resolution of patterns can make a big difference in success or failure of tasks. In addition, how are the continuous orientation of parts represented by characters?\n- Section 5.1 is interesting but not sure how it connects to the rest of the paper. I don\u2019t see the use of spacing between digits in the example prompts. In addition, none of the prompts have numbers beyond just double floating point precision. They don't even utilize all the possibilities in the double digit floating points (referring to my earlier point about floating numbers are coming from a set of few floating number which can be represented \n- The paper assumes that perception is a solved problem and it does not deal with uncertainties in the perception.\n- What is total number of trials for Table 1 and 2?"

In this context, the paper lacks discussion about _why_ LLM policies might be preferable.\n  - Section 1 mentions \"scaling\". Does this refer to scaling in terms of the variety of tasks? Maybe the LLM provides zero-shot generalization abilities to many different tasks. In that case, the experimental validation presented here is quite weak, it only presents two kinds of tasks. Experiments for other contact-rich tasks from previous works, like inserting plates into dishwasher racks [1], loading bookshelves, opening door handles [4], screwing nuts on bolts [5], USB insertion [2], plug insertion [2] etc. would have helped demonstrate the unique scaling ability provided by LLMs.\n  - If some other reasons make LLM policies more attractive, please discuss those reasons.\n- The impact of hint inputs (Section 4.1(3)) is not experimentally validated. This is important, because from the text it seems like the hints provide strong policy guidance like \"do a grid pattern search\".\n- Impact of noise in state description provided to the LLM (e.g. imperfectly sensed spatial pattern of the board in Fig. 3(d), or noisy robot starting pose) is not examined experimentally.\n- Is the scripted policy for the insertion task unfairly weak compared to the LLM? It is tuned to the easiest object `circle` and expected to generalize to `star` and `half-pipe`.
