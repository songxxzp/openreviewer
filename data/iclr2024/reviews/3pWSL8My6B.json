It appears the evidence presented in the paper is only applicable and demonstrated for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). For example, I cannot see how this proof or claims can be applied to other AI models that are not DNNs, such as Random Forests, which considers the outputs of all trees; k-NN's, that use all features to compute distances, or Boosting algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting Machines). Specifically, the empirical evidence presented in the paper in Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Table 1, only apply to deep neural network models, and there is no other AI models that are not DNN's to support this claim.\n* It is not clear how the input variables should be grouped to form the set of $S$ input variables. For example, in the dog image example, \"image regions\" are proposed; however, there is no indication or discussion on how large these \"image regions\" should be for the approach and proof to work. For example, does this sparse primitive approach still hold if the \"image regions\" are too small, e.g., each region is a single pixel, and does it still hold if the \"image regions\" are too large, e.g., encompassing most of the image, or even half of the image. Some discussion on this, and how to select these groupings could be informative to the reader.\n*  Missing error bars; and large error bars. There appears to be missing error bars for Figure 4, Figure 5 (a), Table 1 (top row: Percent of samples with monotonicity). The provided error bars in Table 1 and Table 2, are so large that they overlap; leading the reader to suspect that the claim of the input samples satisfying the monotonicity assumption is not empirically verified, as the numeric results in Table 1 are not statistically significant, as the error bars overlap."

Intuitively, if each subset carries useful info, then yes.\nHowever, in many situation that is not the case. For instance, even in Figure 2, three unmasked regions (row 2) yield a much smaller output than two unmasked regions (row 1). The authors also mention that if there are many noisy regions, then only focus on the salient regions.\nIn practice, how to does one know such info apriori?\n\n- assumption 3 assumes there exists a constant $p$ such an inequality hold. But no bound on $p$ is derived. \nFrom the definition, $p$ can be arbitrarily large. Then it is not clear how Thm 2 shows the sparsity of interactions for models satisfies assumption 1-3.\n(See more details in Question section.)\n\n2. These lead to my major concern: practicality. While intuitively, the proposed three criterion all make sense, however, for a general DNN model, how to validate these three conditions, besides empirically testing after training, is somehow unclear.\n\n\n3. Implication of the work: my understanding is that the authors aim to derive conditions, under which DNN models will produce sparse positive interactions (considered as small number of concepts). As detailed above, if one can't test these conditions prior training, how would these conditions be used? On the other hand, it would be nice if the authors could comment on implications of Thm 3, i.e. how would knowing many DNN are able to learn a few key concepts benefit us?"

Most importantly is using the Harsanyi dividend as the definition of interactions in an AI model.

Overall, I think the paper is well written and provides many of the explanations and details I needed to understand and gain a reasonable intuition on the primary contribution.\n\nI can\u2019t speak well enough on the novelty and significance of this work, but I believe if others are satisfied the paper is sufficiently novel I will happily agree.\n\n1. While using language is a decent entry to test the main properties of large models, this work (specifically how interactions are encoded) seems like it might be limited when working with models for image data. Specifically, how might one actually build a set of interactions (S) such that we achieve what is illustrated in figure 1? \n2. While the paper says these are properties of a well trained AI model, don\u2019t these assumptions really speak more to the data you are using to train and test the AI model? Assumption 2 does speak towards the output of the model, but isn\u2019t this necessarily implying the input data can be well partitioned into the discrete set of interactions?\n3. Assumption 3 is the weakest in terms of justification. While it applies to our current models, I\u2019m not sure the upperbound on inference confidence is a property generally exhibited by \u201cAI models\u201d. This wouldn\u2019t be an issue if this was stated as a part of the discussion of assumption 3, but I don\u2019t buy the upperbound portion being undesirable.\n\n\n### Edits\n- I think you should mention the relationship to shapley values a bit more prominently in your main text. You have the relations expanded in the appendix, but as a sentence of a footnote should include a point to this in your main text (I was distracted thinking how much this reminded me of Shapley values, but was not familiar with Harsanyi interactions). \n- Figures 1 and 2 should be moved closer to where they are referenced in the paper. \n- section 3.1: \u201csparse symbolic (spase) interactions\u201d I think the first sparse should be removed?\n- 3.2: \u201cAssumption 1-\\alpha\u201d you can use \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} to make the symbol bolded in the assumption header."
