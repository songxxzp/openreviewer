The authors present a language modeling inspired approach to predicting shortest paths by using a transformer to predict the next vertex in path given a partial path. The model jointly encodes the natural language constraints, the source vertex, the destination vertex, the path taken so far, and candidates for the next vertex and predicts the next vertex in the path. The model is trained autoregressively on ground truth paths and beam search decoding is used to predict the shortest path at inference time. Experimental results are show that the trained model is able to produce high-quality paths given natural language queries on real-world datasets."

This local context allows the model to scale to massive graphs. However, it means the model may struggle with some types of long-range reasoning during routing. One example is to identify long shortcuts in the graph between distant vertices. With only local context, long shortcuts may not be recognized. Another example is reasoning about global properties of the graph such as determining a route which should avoid an entire region of the graph. In summary, the reliance on local context enables scaling to large graphs but inherently restricts the model's ability to reason about global graph structure and long-range dependencies. This could become a limitation for certain complex routing queries that require broader reasoning.\n\n* Query fulfillment prioritized over efficiency may lead to suboptimal routes.\n\nThe paper prioritizes training the model to fulfill query constraints, even if that results in slightly less efficient routes. This makes sense for satisfying user requirements, but may produce routes that are longer or slower than necessary. In other words, the model lacks an explicit training signal to prefer efficient routing conditional on fulfilling the query. The lack of joint training on both query fulfillment and efficiency could lead to routes that satisfy the query but are not optimally efficient. This could become problematic in practice if it generates unnecessarily long routes over many queries. Explicitly optimizing for efficiency while still satisfying queries could improve the overall routing performance.\n\n* Lack comparisons to other learning-based routing methods.\n\nThe paper does not provide direct comparisons to other machine learning approaches for routing, such as graph neural networks for routing, reinforcement learning for routing, attention-based models for vehicle routing. Without comparisons, it is hard to assess if the performance is truly state-of-the-art among learning-based methods."
