Specifically, the paper first extends the current PAC-Bayes bound for bounded loss functions to unbounded loss functions and introduces trainable priors. The end result is a practical AC-Bayes bound consisting of learnable parameters: model weights, prior parameters, posterior parameters, and a moment parameter. The algorithm jointly optimizes over all learnable weights. Compared to the existing optimization framework, the PAC-Bayes framework does not require extensive learning rate tuning and comes with built-in learnable regularization capabilities. Experimentally, the proposed framework achieves similar performance with extensively tuned existing pipelines."

Specifically, the KL divergence term $KL(Q|P)$ between the parametrized posterior and prior, using Gaussian distributions, reduces to learnable weight decays and noise injection. The regularization strength is controlled by the variance parameters in the prior and posterior respectively. \n\n* **Distributional output**: Conventional optimization pipeline only yields a MLE point estimation, the proposed method returns a posterior distribution over model weights, which could be utilized for Bayesian inference with improved robustness and better uncertainty quantification."

The reason is that the algorithm needs the exact number of training data sizes and data augmentation breaks this assumption. This is discussed by the authors in the appendix. Nevertheless, this is an important limitation of the approach. \n\n* **Lack experiments**:  On CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 experiments, the proposed method is on par with existing optimization methods, which need extensive hyper-parameter tuning, especially for regularization heuristics. Given the theory-oriented nature of this paper, this is reasonable. However, it would be great to scale up experiments to medium/large datasets. More importantly, given the claim that the proposed framework automatically learns regularization, it is *necessary* to test its performance under a low-data regime for example using only 10% of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. This will make the claim of being *nearly tuning-free* much more convincing. \n\n* **Need more clarity on $K(\\lambda)$**: The loss function derived from the PAC-Bayes bound has three important terms, the empirical data-driven loss, the KL divergence between the posterior and the prior, and $K(\\lambda)$. It's not clear what role $K(\\lambda)$ plays in the overall algorithm. Since it is estimated before training, it is also not clear how it affects the learning in terms of gradient."

I would suggest the authors run a study on varying the number of training data, e.g., 10%, 50%, and report the performance and the learned variances for the prior and posterior. What do you expect the prior and posterior variances to be when the dataset size is small and how do the results support this? \n\nI will be happy to raise my score if this concern is addressed convincingly."

                "value": "1. The authors develop a novel and arguably tighter PAC-Bayes bound but never put it to test (at least from what I could see). I don\u2019t see any generalisation bounds reported in the paper, so it is hard to gauge how much of a contribution the novel bound is in terms of tightness, compared to the previous works cited in this paper. I understand that this is not the main focus of the paper but it would definitely strengthen its technical contribution, i.e. the bound itself. I would have also liked to see a discussion regarding the trade-offs of having a learnable prior. What if the set of priors is so large that it includes the posterior, i.e. the KL term could be set to zero perfectly. How large would the resulting penalisation term be? Is there ever a scenario where this could lead to a non-vacuous bound? \u2028Also, how does this learnable prior compare to methods that perform a (discrete) grid search over the prior and then perform a union bound, resulting in an additional  penalty term (e.g. [1])? \n2. The paper focuses on the efficiency of their proposed method, which arises due to the absence of hyper-parameter tuning. I am not convinced by these claims based on the empirical experiments performed in this work:\n\\\n\\\n    a) There seems to be a certain arbitrariness as to what hyper-parameters are simply chosen ad-hoc and turn out to work well. The $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ values are for instance set to values that work well for the vision tasks but they actually need adaptation for the graph and text tasks, suggesting that some tuning is actually needed. I also could not find a stability analysis for the default choices, were those just the first values tried or was an initial grid search actually needed to find those values? There is also a warmup period only detailed in the Appendix to ensure faster convergence, how was the duration of this set? \u2028I also would like to see a comparison to SGD/Adam/AdamW, where the default hyper-parameter settings are used. For instance, I very rarely see anyone changing the default momentum value for simple tasks such as CIFAR10/CIFAR100. I would also like to see a plot depicting how sensitive the baselines are to individual parameters such as the learning rate, momentum etc, I think the results are already in Figure 1 but need to be re-grouped accordingly.\n\\\n\\\n    b) The method is strongly more involved conceptually than the standard objectives. First, K_min needs to be estimated before-hand and it\u2019s not clear how the quality of such an approximation affects results. The optimisation has to be split into two phases, where the objective is reduced in the second part to ensure better convergence properties. The objective itself is naturally also more complicated although this might be fine as it also comes with theoretical guarantees. The hurdle for practitioners to use this framework might be rather high and I\u2019m not convinced at this point if it is worth the effort.\n\\\n\\\n    c) My biggest concern however is due to the training time required for the proposed method. A single run on CIFAR10, according to Table 8 in the Appendix takes roughly 7000 seconds, while for SGD the same takes roughly 600 seconds. This means that one can roughly perform 12 SGD runs in the time it takes to perform a single run with the PAC-Bayes technique. I would argue first that (1) it does not take 12 runs of SGD to find an acceptable hyper-parameter setting, especially not on simple tasks such as CIFAR10/CIFAR100. (2) Even if 12 runs are required, I would argue that one has obtained a better understanding of the task in the sense of what techniques work etc, and subsequent re-runs of the same method will be very cheap. Moreover, one could even make use of those 12 runs and build an ensemble, perform uncertainty quantification etc. I also believe that this should be discussed more transparently in the main text, instead of the Appendix.\n\n\n[1] Dziugaite and Roy, Computing Nonvacuous Generalization Bounds for Deep (Stochastic) Neural Networks with Many More Parameters than Training Data"

            "summary": {
                "value": "The paper introduces a training framework that improves the generalization ability of neural networks without extensive hyper-parameter tuning and regularization. By minimizing the PAC-Bayes bound with trainable priors, the framework achieves comparable performance to traditional methods like SGD/Adam, even without additional regularization. It eliminates the need for hyper-parameter search and reduces reliance on validation data. The paper highlights the importance of weight decay and noise injections as essential techniques. The approach shows promise for enhancing generalization in deep neural networks."

                "value": "1. This paper generally is well-written and easy to follow.\n2. The idea of tuning-free generalizaton with trainable prior is both interesting and theoretically grounded, and seems to be promising in training neural networks, especially when it can be extended to large-scale neural networks, e.g., transfermers.\n3. This paper has provided solid theoretical analysis, which can be inspiring for the follow-up works."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The paper suggests that only weight decay and noise injections are essential for PAC-Bayes training. However, this conclusion seems premature and lacks comprehensive analysis. It would be beneficial to investigate and compare the impact of other regularization techniques commonly used in deep learning, such as dropout or batch normalization, within the proposed framework. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between different regularization methods and their contribution to generalization performance.\n2. The method proposed in this paper may require i.i.d. data and may not be able to deal with out-of-distribution tasks."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Could the authors elaborate more on why it is so important to give a generalization bound on unbounded loss? Existing bounded one can not work well in practice? An empirical compare with them when apply those bounds for training? From my understanding, the bounded part has now been shifted to the bounded $\\gamma$ with $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ in the unbounded bounds.\n2. Could the authors elaborate more on why optimizing prior on training dataset will be helpful for the generalization performance. Normally, we should fix prior or choose a good one using validation dataset."
