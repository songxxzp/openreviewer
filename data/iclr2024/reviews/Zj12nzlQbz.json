The method called EigenScore is based on extracting internal representation (layer activations) of the proposed sequences. Then, they compute the covariance matrix of K proposed sequences and then compute the logarithm determinant of the matrix. Intuitively, it measures entropy of the proposed sequences. They also propose the technique for reducing the number of confident hallucinations by clipping the outlier layer activations. In the experiments they empirically show that their proposed metric correlates with the correctness of the outputs more than other baselines such as Perplexity, Lexical similarity, Length normalized entropy and Energy."

A key component is the EigenScore metric, which measures semantic consistency in the embedding space and represents differential entropy. This helps identify overconfident and contradictory generations. They also introduce a test time feature clipping approach that truncates extreme activations, thereby reducing overconfidence and enabling better hallucination detection. Experiments on several QA benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance in hallucination detection. Ablation studies verify the efficacy of the proposed techniques, including the EigenScore metric and feature clipping. Overall, INSIDE provides an effective way to detect hallucinated content from LLMs by leveraging their internal states and controlling overconfidence. The EigenScore and feature clipping are two key innovations that improve hallucination detection."
