                "value": "This work considers replacing the quantization layer of vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE) with a learnable transform quantization strategy. The goal of VQ-VAE is discrete representation learning, i.e., we want to embed a datapoint in the latent space using an encoder network, and we want the representation in the latent space to belong to a discrete set of finite values (referred to as the codebook). This codebook is learnt by jointly training the encoder and decoder network. \n\nTraditional VQ-VAE approaches consists of a quantization layer, in which the codebook (or the quantization points) is done using K-means clustering or exponential moving average. These approaches have some issues such as codebook collapse, in which the learnt codebook is a very small set of points compared to the latent space. The alternative strategy proposed in this paper, learns a transform quantization strategy, in which the transform coefficients are learnt in the training process. Doing so circumvents some problems associated with the traditional VQ-VAE approach such as codebook collapse. Furthermore, the authors also constrain the basis to be diagonal so as to learn few parameters and perform the inversion easily. \n\nPlease correct me if I am mistaken in my understanding of the contributions of the paper. I am more than happy to rectify my review if that's the case."

The complexity of doing the quantization is less compared to a traditional nearest neighbor search, because of the additional cubic structure imposed on the quantization lattice, as a consequence of which, Babai's rounding strategy can be easily applied. The proposed strategy also has a a smaller reconstruction error between the input and the decoder output, while simultaneously circumventing issues like codebook collapse."

(Neural discrete representation learning), and this work borrows a lot of notations from that paper. But despite this, it'd be appreciated if the authors can briefly describe the notations and succinct descriptions of key concepts (such as Babai's rounding algorithm).\n\n2. Several choices made in this paper need to justified better? For instance why only restricting to diagonal basis for imposing structure. Several works have shown that structure can also be imposed by other structures such as a block diagonal structure, or deterministic orthonormal bases such as Hadamard frames. These bases have shown very good performance in terms of quantization reconstruction errors (although not in the context of variational autoencoders).\n\n3. It is not really clear how the proposed strategy \"effectively quantizes the data to a codebook of finite size\". How can the size of the codebook be **infinite**?\n\n4. Why is the sparsity promoting term in the loss objective used with a negative term? And even if it is used with a negative sign, wouldn't $\\gamma = -1$ promote sparsity in $B$, instead of \"pushing the lattice to be as dense as possible\" as mentioned on Page $4$?
