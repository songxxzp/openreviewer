                "value": "**Weaknesses**\n\n1. The questions asked and analysis performed in this work is very similar to [1, 2]. The paper should clarify contributions and better differentiate what findings are unique.\n2. The paper should better motivate the \"Is the following statement something you would say?\" questions. Section 4.1 states \"which reflects the probability of the model will tend to say yes to such a negative statement (and hence behave undesirably)\". Section 4.2 states \"where a larger value indicates the model\u2019s higher likelihood to assert the input statement\". However, no evidence is provided for these statements. Since the interestingness/meaningfulness of the analysis presented is predicated on this assumption, it should be supported with actual evidence. To the best of my knowledge, the ability to self-reflect in this manner has only been demonstrated in certain limited contexts and settings; such as models reflecting on the validity of their own answers post-hoc [3]. However, that setting is quite different from the one here as the factuality of a statement is independent of the model.\n3. The methodology in Section 4.2 seems flawed. Unnormalized logits aren't comparable across timesteps/examples since they have different normalization constants. \n4. The analysis is limited to a subset of behaviors. This choice is justified because \"we select a subset of behaviors whose embodiment by an AI is likely to have pretty broad agreement on whether humans would like or dislike.\" I'm not particularly convinced by this. I, for one, would be significantly more concerned about current models displaying \"anti-LGBTQ-rights\" behaviors (which are somewhat trivialized in the paper as being political) than behaviors like \"acts-like-it-wants-to-help-humans-but-does-not-care-about-that\", as the near-term causal mechanism for potential harm is much clearer to me regarding the former given current model capabilities. Of course, I don't expect to agree with the premises of all research, but I do expect papers to motivate their research program using more rigor than assertions of consensus.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

                "value": "The paper uses a previously proposed model of \"behavior decomposition\" to investigate the responses of a large language model (LLaMA2-7B) on the Anthropic's persona evaluation dataset. First, the paper attempts to empirically validate a theoretical claim that RLHF makes the distributions of \"positive\" and \"negative\" behaviors more distinguishable. The paper uses two metrics for that: KL-divergence and Wasserstein distance. With the first metric, no consistent increase in distinguishability is observed. With the second, an increase is observed more often. The paper then analyzes \"steerability\" of the LLM towards misaligned behavior before and after RLHF. Steerability in this context means the ability for the model to exhibit negative persona traits after prompting with persona descriptions of varying length. The model after RLHF is shown to be more steerable overall, and it is shown that it requires shorter prompts. The paper postulates that these results suggest that RLHF is not adequate as an algorithm for aligning LLMs."

I believe this is an important idea."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I think the results in the paper could provide a starting point for an investigation, but are currently not sufficient for a conference paper.\n- The experiments with distinguishability are inconclusive, i.e. it is unclear whether RLHF significantly increases distinguishability of positive and negative behaviors. Depending on whether $\\beta$-distinguishability or Wasserstein distance is used, the results come out differently. The paper does not provide an experimentally supported explanation for this phenomenon. Instead, it makes a vague claim: \"We postulate that this inconsistency may stem from the process not being explicitly tailored to target specific human-like psychological behaviors for avoidance.\" A rigorous evaluation for why the inconsistency exists would be crucial to make the claims in the paper interesting.\n- Steerability results are also quite limited. The plots in Figures 3 and 9, for most behaviors, show that there is a single prompt (most often 2 to 4 sentences long) which is sufficient to make the RLHF model understand the persona, and the prompts of higher length do not increase the understanding, so misalignment rate just oscillates stochastically. The base model does not show the high misalignment rate likely because it simply cannot follow the instructions as well as the model after RLHF. Arguably, there is not much correlation between the prompt length and misalignment beyond this simple effect.\n- I think impersonating a character with provided traits and answering yes-or-no questions from the character's point of view does not constitute dangerous behavior by the model, so it was not removed by RLHF. The main claim of Section 5 is that \"RLHF model is more steerable to exhibit negative behaviors often\". A good RLHF algorithm makes a model more steerable in any direction, while prohibiting dangerous behavior. Hence, I suspect that RLHF with more strict criteria provided to evaluators, such as \"do not allow the model to impersonate negative characters\" could avoid this issue. I think the conclusion that \"the prevailing practice of training a centralized RLHF model may not be optimally suited to address the intricate and diverse spectrum of human values, calling on future approaches for more comprehensive alignment techniques\" is plausible, but it does not follow from the results of the paper. Why discard RLHF if we can simply adjust the annotation process?\n- Figures 2 and 6 show logit values of the \"Yes\" output. If I understand this correctly, these are the pre-softmax values produced by the LLM. These values are not normalized, so the plots are not very meaningful. The authors observe that \"the output values generally shift to be smaller for the RLHF model compared to the base model\". This is not an interesting observation, since the softmax output does not change if all inputs are shifted by a constant. A more interesting quantity to look at would be $\\log \\mathbb{P}[\\text{Yes}\\mid s]$, where $s$ is the persona prompt and the statement. Footnote on page 5 states that the probabilities can be extremely small, so we should not look at them directly, but $\\log$ probabilities would not suffer from this issue. I suspect that if we analyzed the distributions of $\\log \\mathbb{P}$ among the questions, the Wasserstein distance results would come out as more ambiguous.\n- The paper fails to connect the results for distinguishability and steerability: \"For most plots, the RLHF model (in orange) is capable of being prompted to behave more negatively with a higher misalignment rate than the base model (in gray). However, the degree to which this occurs does not seem to be predicted by the distinguishability\". This failure to conform to the theoretical results from Wolf et al is not explained. I suspect that the reason is that Wolf et al claim that when the behaviors are better distinguishable, there _exists_ a short prompt that induces negative behavior. However, the authors of the paper at review do not search for a prompt of a given length extensively, and only try one prompt for each length.\n- The text is rather diluted, with many ideas repeated almost word-for-word multiple times, e.g. the claim that RLHF cannot be used to align language models properly.\n- The phrasing \"we conceptualize LLM outputs as a decomposition of behaviors into positive and negative sub-distributions\" in the abstract is misleading, since the authors are not the first ones to propose this decomposition, as they note in the main text."

                "value": "I have a couple of concerns with this paper\n\n* The experimentation is limited to one particular model LLAMA 2. Since the authors themselves do not do any further training or finetuninng themselves, any observation that they make are subject to the design and data decisions undertaken while developing LLAMA-2. To make more concrete observations about RLHF vs SFT, I would expect to see similar behaviors across a few different class of SOTA LLMs. Otherwise, one cannot concretely say that the observations generalize across all classes of LLMs.\n\n* Secondly, while the paper proposes some observations, I would have loved more detailed ablations into the hypotheses which cause the behavior to be observed. For instance, if one is making such an observation \"RLHF training process may not have been explicitly tailored to target specific human-like psychological behaviours for avoidance\", I would have loved to see an ablation where some additional human data is collected or gathered from open source data on these behaviours, further RLHF the model on this data and demonstrate that this effect disappears or is mitigated to some extent.\n\n* Thirdly the paper presents two ideas for distinguishability -- Beta distinguishability and Wasserstein distance. They have a brief hypothesis suggesting that RLHF is not a direct likelihood maximizing loss and hence needs a different distinguishability metric. I don't quite see how introducing Wasserstein distance adds further value to the analysis  of distinguishability or the steerability results that follow later as I can see RLHF models being more steerable negatively even after a high Wasserstein distance between behaviors. Also, I do not see an explanation why other forms of distribution divergence is not good enough compared to Wasserstein.\n\nOverall, a general theme to improve would be the limited nature of evaluations/experiments translating to relatively lesser research impact and a need for clearer narrative in terms of the questions that are asked in the paper."

From what I understand, I think the current study is based only on the probability of the model answering Yes or No as plausible responses to the prompts. Can I understand if you introduced any extra text in the prompt to ask the model to stick to these responses only and not place its logit weight on other forms of saying something similar ? I am asking this question particularly because of your observation of using the raw logits instead of probabilities.\n\n2. Persona prompts is one form of jailbreaks which can be used to study steerability. Did you try other forms of adversarial attacks ? I am wondering if the general notion of steerability is broader than just persona prompts.\n\n3. In related work or other sections, can you clearly distinguish the contributions compared to Wolf et al (2023) as I see a lot of similarities particularly with respect to theory and practice around the beta-distinguishability. Particularly, it will be interesting to test-time probe the models finetuned on the behaviors in Wolf et al(2023) as another observation to see how the effects change on further finetuning for these behaviors.\n\n4. Overall I am wondering how generalizable are these observations considering it was done on test-time probing one class of models. Would it be possible to try this analysis in few other classes of models available opensource atleast ?\nThere are several forms of RM training, data collection and RLHF that can be done in the wild and incase we are making generic statements about SFT vs RLHF.\n\n5. As a follow up, can you add a limitations section to the paper explaining why or how generalizable these observations can be and what further studies need to be done to make them more generalizable"
