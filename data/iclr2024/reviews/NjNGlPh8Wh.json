The authors provide theoretical lower and upper bounds for different decoding step sizez, log (L), linear (Time n^2; Space n), and polynomial (P). Their proof for the lower bounds relies on a construction that enables retrieval across different columns in the transformer (\u201cLayer-norm hash\u201d), which is used to simulate automata and Turing machines in transformer forward passes. The upper bounds are proven by straightforwardly simulating attention via a TM."

In particular, Equation 1 shows that the class of problems solvable with $t(n)$ intermediate steps are those solvable by multitape Turing machines using similar time or space."

The authors show that for an input of size n, adding log n intermediate steps doesn't add much to the power of transformers without intermediate steps.  However, adding a linear number of intermediate steps results in a significant increase in reasoning power -- allowing transformers to recognize languages somewhere between regular and contex-sensitive languages in the Chomsky hierarchy.  The authors also show that using t(n) intermediate steps allows a transformer to mimic t(n) steps of a Turing machine.  Finally, they also show that allowing a transformer poly(n) intermediate steps precisely captures the class of problems solvable in deterministic polynomial time.  The paper presents complexity-theoretic lower and upper bounds of the computational power of transformers with the ability to use t(n) intermediate steps, for various functions t(n)."
