                "value": "- The dimensionality of the shared and residual dynamics can be estimated from the singular value decomposition/low rank approximation of the Henkel matrices, as mentioned in Appendix A.1.5. However this estimation method will be accurate under the assumption that the observed latent dynamical system is indeed linear (instead of approximated by a linear system). Do the authors have any estimation on how the method will perform in cases where the latent system is nonlinear? In this case both the evolution equation of the latent process will be an approximation, but also importantly the dimensionalities of the shared and residual dynamics will probably be estimated inaccurately. I think it would be helpful to see systematic evaluations on how the method performs:\n   - i) when the dimensionalities of the subspaces are misestimated, and \n  - ii) when the linearity assumption does not hold (assuming that the dimensionalities of the subspaces have been correctly assessed). For example In Figure 2 (where the method is applied on primate data) I wouldn\u2019t say that the estimation of the dimensionality actually works (Figure 2 a and b).\n- In Section 3.1 in mentioning the model parameters that the method identifies, the authors do not include the noise variance of the Gaussian observation process $z_k$ (I.e. the characteristics of the noise term $epsilon_k$). Similarly in Section 3.2.3. \n   - Does this mean that the noise variance of the Gaussian observation process does not influence the performance of the method. Can the authors comment on this? \n   - Moreover I would also include the dimensionality of the latent process and the dimensionality of the shared subspace dynamics in the model parameters that are estimated.\n- How would the approach compare to estimation based on the Gaussian observation process? In Figure 1 the authors compare their framework with the PLDSID one, but I wonder how the method would compare to a method relying only on the continuous observations for identifying the shared subspace dynamics.\n- In Figure 1 caption the authors mention: \u201cPG-LDS-ID stage 1 used a dimensionality given by $\\min(4, n_x )$ \u201c. Can you explain what is meant with this phrase, and how the value 4 was chosen?\n\nMinor comments on writing:\n\n- In the first paragraph of the introduction the authors mention \u201cSecond, disjoint dynamics present in either observation can obscure and confound modeling of their shared dynamics\u201d. Up to here in the text it is still unclear what \u201cdisjoint dynamics\u201d is, and what \u201ceach observation\u201d refers to. For the latter I would propose to replace with \u201ceach observation stream\u201d or something along these lines. For the first, I would use something referring to \u201cuncorrelated\u201d part of the dynamics or residual as you call it later, but with a brief explanation what exactly is meant with this term.\n\n- Similarly in Page 4 point 2., the authors mention the transition matrix presented later in the text without giving more detail at this point transition matrix of which of the processes they consider they refer to.\n- In the introduction the authors refer to the part of the dynamics that is only observable through one observation process as \u201cdisjoint\u201d part, while in the main text they refer to this part as residual dynamics. I would propose to stick to one of those terms (preferably the latter one) to avoid confusing the readers.\n\n----\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Ahmadipour, P., Sani, O. G., Pesaran, B., & Shanechi, M.

                "value": "This paper proposed a multi-stage algorithm based on method of moments and positive semidefinite programming to estimate a dynamical system, where the observations come from two processes with shared dynamics. The authors consider specifically the setting where one process is Gaussian and another is Poisson, and the latent state of the Gaussian process leads to better prediction of the Poisson process but not vice versa. Simulation results show that the proposed method can accurately recover the shared dynamic, and real data experiment shows that the proposed method has better prediction accuracies compared with prior work."

Compared to previous work (Buesing et al 2012), the inclusion of another correlated process leads to better prediction.\n\n2. By using second order moments, the proposed method can now deal with generalized linear processes instead of Gaussian."
