The paper reveals that incorporating temporal data regarding the agent's lifetime empowers the newly discovered algorithm to dynamically refine its objectives, such as the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, thereby fostering the development of a higher-performing agent. The proposed method can be readily combined with two existing algorithm, LPG and LPO, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a wide variety of benchmarks, including MiniGrid and MinAtar."

The basic idea is to add the information about the lifetime to the input vector of the meta-learning algorithm. The authors propose two algorithms, Temporally-Adaptive Learned Policy Gradient (TA-LPG) and TA-Learned Policy Optimization (TA-LPO) by extending LPG and LPO, respectively. Then, the authors found that the evolutionary strategy is more appropriate than meta-gradient approaches to optimize the upper-level objective function."

Is it the total number of interactions, denoted by $N$ later?  \n2. Two variables $n/N$ and $\\log N$ are augmented in TA-LPG. Is $n/N = 0$ when $N$ is unbounded? In my understanding, $N$ is determined and fixed before training. Would you explain $N$ and provide an example task? \n3. In TA-LPO, $ \\frac{n}{N} x_{r, A}$ is augmented. It is not straightforward to me because it is proportional to $x_{r, A}$, which means linearly-dependent. Would you explain the problem if $n/N$ and $\\log N$ are added as the authors did in TA-LPG? \n4. In the final paragraph of Section 4.2, the authors mentioned, \"We found this stabilized training and led to higher performance...\" Would you explain \"this stabilized training\" in detail? If it means the rank transformation, it is used in Salimans et al. (2017). Discussing the relation between two equations would be better if the stabilized training means Eq. (12) rather than (11). \n5. I do not fully understand the final paragraph of Section 3.1. In the manuscript, LPG and LPO are selected as the base algorithms. However, the authors mentioned as follows: In our work, we focus on instances of meta-RL that parameterize surrogate loss functions with $\\phi$ and apply gradient-based updates to $\\pi_\\theta$ (Houthooft et al., 2018; Kirsch et al., 2019; Bechtle et al., 2021). Does it mean that three algorithms are implemented somewhere?\n6. Equation (10): Is $x_{r, A}$ a typo of $x_{p, A}$? \nPlease update the reference Kirsch et al. (2019) to Kirsch et al. (2020).
