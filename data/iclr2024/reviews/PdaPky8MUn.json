They propose to pretrain models on the downstream task data (self pretaining or SPT) before fine-tuning on the task. This significantly closes the gap between many sequence models on long-range sequence tasks. The work also investigates the importance of manually designed biases to help methods capture long-range dependencies and finds that SPT makes these biases less important."

Questioning some of the assumptions and usefulness of benchmarks such as this is a fresh and interesting direction.\n\n- Most of the experimental results are strong and convincing. The proposed SPT really does seem to improve the performance of methods such as Transformers previously considered to be unable to solve LRA. This is compelling since SPT is more in line with how large models are often trained.\n\n- The investigations of explicit priors and effects across data scales are also interesting angles to explore."

                "value": "- The paper does not seem to take the cost of SPT vs training directly on the downstream task into account, or at least does not make this axis of comparison clear. \n  - The details are unclear in how much time is spent pretraining vs fine-tuning with the SPT procedure and how this compares to the typical training method for these tasks. These points should be discussed clearly in the main paper.\n  - It is stated in Section 3.2 that sub-par LRA performance is often cited as a prime motivating factor for new methods, but it seems efficiency is often just as important a reason new methods are proposed\n  - If one method can be directly trained on the task, while another has to first be pretrained and then fine-tuned, one would need to compare the cost/time/compute/etc to achieve a certain performance to determine if one method is superior, at least in many settings (note this point is less relevant in large scale language and vision settings where pretraining is the norm). \n  - Further exploration and clarification on these points would improve the paper.\n\n- Even when trained with SPT, it seems from the results that methods such as S4 with structured biases consistently outperform methods with less structured biases across almost every task (I believe Text and Retrieval in Table 2 are the only exceptions to this). The reviewer agrees these differences are not as drastic as it seems when using the traditional procedure, but it still seems the structured biases are helping and the traditional procedure is somewhat predictive of the ordering. Or is this just an artifact of the experiments? A potential discussion on this point could be useful. \n\n- Table 1 lists many efficient attention methods that were originally evaluated on LRA. It would have been interesting to see a couple of these methods also trained with SPT to confirm empirically that they also do not perform as poorly when using SPT. (I suspect this is the case, but currently have to guess since no result is provided).\n\n- The tasks considered in this paper are standard, but nonetheless the addition of less synthetic or larger scale tasks and experiments would also make the paper more compelling to a broader audience\n\n- No code appears to be included (it seems it will be made available based on the anonymized link, but would have been nice to explore during the review)."

                "value": "1. Could you clarify the pretraining vs fine-tuning procedure and how much time is spent on both for each method? Please let me know if I have missed this in the main paper. Appendix B.1 says models were trained for 200 epochs or 24 h \"for pretraining and fine-tuning\", but it is unclear if this means 200 epochs of pretraining and 200 epochs of fine-tuning? If so this would seem to be much more time/epochs than some of the baseline methods were trained.\n\n2. In Table 2, was the Transformer + Rotary embeddings trained without SPT? This seems unlikely. Perhaps there is a typo in the description of the Transformer methods in this table?\n\n3. In Table 2, the X \"denotes computationally infeasible or unreported results\". These are 2 drastically different things and 2 separate symbols should probably be used.\n\n4. The methods evaluated for Figure 2 still seem to use complex valued parameterizations even though they are randomly initialized. Is this still necessary when using SPT? Since complex values can be problematic when scaling large scale systems, it would be interesting if SPT also removed the need for this in SSMs/linear RNNs."

Would SPADE+SPT or MEGA+SPT further improve the performance? Is there a reason this comparison is not included in the paper?\n\n- Regarding the experiment about pretraining on text corpora: I appreciate the idea of comparing results with a pretrained model on a large language dataset. However, the current results are meaningless since the downstream task datasets are very different from Pythia 70M. I'm not sure we are able to find the right dataset to cover all the tasks for Long Range Arena. What about separating this experiment from Long Range Arena and showing the comparison for another downstream task on the language domain?\n\n- Are S4/Transformers trained with the same number of epochs as S4+SPT/Transformers+SPT (including pretraining+finetuning)? If it's not, these results should be added. I'm asking to make sure the single-trained models are not undertrained."
