It investigates the issue that count-based bonuses make the reward function non-stationary. The authors propose to augment the state space with visitation count for states (or representative embeddings of states). Therefore, the reward function in count-based exploration becomes stationary and satisfies Markovian property (i.e. the reward is fully determined by the state in this and next step given the augmented state space).\n\nThe authors conduct extensive experiments on 3D navigation maps, and procedurally generated environments with high-dimensional observation space. The experiments combine the proposed approach with multiple count-based exploration algorithms, on both reward-free and sparse-reward RL problems. The empirical results validate that it is beneficial for exploration to include state visitation count as a component in state space."

If not, could the proposed method be general enough to improve other exploration approaches for hard-exploration problems with high-dimensional observations?\n\nThe proposed method is specifically constrained to the count-based exploration approach.

Could you provide any rigorous mathematical proof showing that C_{t-1} is a sufficient statistics for the count-based rewards?\n\nIn Section 3.2., the paper introduces the notation \\phi_t without definition. For the context, I think it refers to sufficient statistics for count-based bonuses, but this point is very unclear in Section 3.2. Also, sufficient statistics in the problem setting are not defined. \n\nIn Equation 7, does s_t include sufficient statistics \\phi_t or not? I think the state s_t means a fully observable state in the augmentation MDP \\hat{M}, so s_t should already contain the information in \\phi_t. Then it is weird to have the reward function and policy depending on both s_t and \\phi_t in Equation 7.\n\nThe empirical results in Figure 4 look interesting. Could it successfully go to any goal position in the training map? If the exploration policy is trained on many different navigation maps. Could the policy be general enough to navigate to any goal position in unseen map?"

            "questions": {
                "value": "1) Count-based bonuses have been largely employed for hard-exploration tasks, either in terms of regret minimization in theoretical papers or shaping of sparse rewards in empirical literature. From my perspective, count-based bonuses are not a great fit for pure exploration instead: They are not only non-stationary, as the authors noted, but also vanishing, and suffer from some other well-known issues (see Ecoffet et al., Go-Explore: A new approach for hard-exploration problems, 2021). However, only in the pure exploration setting the POMDP argument and optimality of history-based policies seem to make sense. If an external reward is there, it is a actually good to converge to a Markovian deterministic policy. Can the authors comment on why they think it is worth studying count-based methods for pure exploration?\n\n2) To follow-up the previous question, count-based bonuses have been used in recent reward-free RL literature as well (e.g., Jin et al., Reward-free exploration for reinforcement learning, 2020). Also in the latter setting, the bonuses are freezed at the start of the episode, so that a Markovian policy optimizing a stationary objective is always deployed to collect data.\n\n3) To address pure exploration settings, other stationary objectives have been designed, e.g., state entropy maximization. Can the authors relates their contributions with this stream of works:\n- Hazan et al., Provably efficient maximum entropy exploration, 2019;\n- Mutti et al., Task-agnostic exploration via policy gradient of a non-parametric state entropy estimate, 2021;\n- Liu & Abbeel, Behavior from the void: Unsupervised active pre-training, 2021;\n- Seo et al., State entropy maximization with random encoders for efficient exploration, 2021;\n- Yarats et al., Reinforcement learning with prototypical representations, 2021;\n- and many others.\nMoreover, is state entropy maximization a meaningful baseline for the reported experimental evaluation?\n\n4) While I am not particularly familiar with the literature of count-based methods, my feeling is that this kind of bonuses have been deeply studied. From a brief research, I am not sure the authors made a thorough due diligence of prior works, especially those addressing the limitations of count-based methods (e.g., Shafer et al., 2020 and Ecoffet et al., 2021 mentioned before). Interestingly, previous works also showed that $1/n$ bonuses bring faster learning in pure exploration settings (Menard et al., Fast active learning for pure exploration in reinforcement learning, 2021).\n\n5) How are the pseudocounts implemented in the experiments? This seems to make a huge different. For instance, Bellemare et al. (2016), Ostrovski et al., Count-based exploration with neural density models (2017), Tang et al., (2017), Machado et al., Count-based exploration with the successor representation (2020) all make different design choices with varying results. Do the authors think their results are general for every implementation of count-based bonuses or for just one?\n\n6) How many seeds are considered in the experiments and what is the meaning of the shaded areas? This crucial information seems to be missing for some of the results.\n\n7) In the ProcGen Maze experiment, the paper comapres SOFE with E3B, ICM, RND. These does not seem to be the state of the art for procedurally generated tasks. Do the authors considered also tailored methods, such as (Ghosh et al., Why generalization in RL is difficult, 2021; Zisselman et al., Explore to generalize in zero-shot RL, 2023)?"

While solutions may be under-explored, the issue is generally known and noted in previous papers (e.g., [1]). Other works have chosen not to tackle the non-stationarity in intrinsic reward as it slowly varies and could be tracked [2]. Also, see the references in W2.\n\n**W2.** A crucial weakness of the paper is that it misses comparisons with previous works that have proposed decoupling exploration and exploitation policies [3, 4] to tackle the non-stationarity introduced due to intrinsic bonuses. The paper would significantly benefit from comparing their approach with baselines based on decoupling exploration and exploitation.\n\n**W3.** An aspect that merits further discussion is that RL algorithms with recurrent architectures (like PPO + LSTM used in the paper) could learn representations that resolve this partial observability [5]. One way to promote this effect could be to have an auxiliary task of predicting intrinsic rewards (which could make for an interesting baseline). \n\nWhile this might perform worse compared to directly providing sufficient statistics in the state (in terms of sample efficiency), it is potentially a more general solution to the problem for other intrinsic rewards.\nFor instance, it has previously been shown that LSTMs can learn to count in discrete settings [6], which could be helpful in episodic exploration settings. Previous work has also shown that recurrent architectures can learn contexts that resolve non-stationarity due to partial observability in bandit problems [7].\n\n\nOverall, I appreciate the direction the authors took to address the non-stationarity introduced by intrinsic rewards. Should the weaknesses and questions be adequately addressed/clarified, I would gladly increase my score.\n\n\n\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\n\n### References\n\n[1]Singh, S., Lewis, R.

                "value": "Q1. There still remains a source of non-stationarity for RL as the considered tasks have a maximum number of steps, but agents are not provided the time step in the state. In the episodic exploration setting $C_t$ can probably be used to infer the time step. However, it might make sense to include the time step in the global exploration setting. I am curious to know the authors\u2019 thoughts regarding this and whether they have tried something along these lines.\n\nQ2. Is there a reason why Figure 3 shows visitations with A2C as the base algorithm, but the evaluation in Figure 4 uses PPO? Would these qualitative results change with the base algorithm?"
