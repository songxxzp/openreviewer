Unlike conventional approaches that use either cascade models or latent diffusion models with an additional autoencoder, Matryoshka Diffusion Models uses a diffusion process that denoises the multi-resolution input jointly, where such a process can be trained progressively and improves the optimization efficiency significantly. The paper shows the effectiveness of the method on popular image generation and video generation tasks and verifies the training efficiency of the method compared with existing diffusion model variants."

For CDMs, while it's possible to train all the stages simultaneously, one cannot generate images from scratch in the middle since the base stage has not been fully trained yet. Somehow, this does not happen for the given model.\n- The ablations and evaluation in general is quite solid.\n- The exposition is good, and the paper is written well."

If I am not mistaken, at the end it still trains stage-by-stage similarly to CDMs \u2014 and without such stage-by-stage training it produces considerably worse results.\n- The paper does not report training costs rigorously for all the experiments, and it's impossible to compare between methods without knowing their training cost.\n- The comparison to CDMs does not seem fair, since the paper compares to under-trained CDMs. If one trains CDMs withing a limited computational budget, then more focus should be put on the base stage, since the final stages converge much faster.\n- FID scores on ImageNet are ~3x times higher than the current SotA (e.g., MDT).\n- The paper makes a claim about good results on a small text-to-image dataset (CC12M), but does not compare to existing large-scale text-to-image generators. This makes it impossible to evaluate this claim \u2014 e.g., Figure 8c should contain the results of existing text-to-image generators to make the existing model comparable. Otherwise, such a claim is not grounded. Judging by the maximum CLIPScore on a CLIP/FID trade-off chart is wrong since in the Imagen's paper, one can notice that even their bad models can attain very high CLIP scores under a strong enough guidance."

I believe that the smaller amount of training could also justify inferior FID results on ImageNet compared to SotA.\n- Are there any other differences compared to f-DM [1] apart from the progressive training idea and larger-scale experiments? It seems that f-DM uses the same NestedUNet idea, but the f-DM authors just do not call it a \"NestedUNet\". Do you use the same noise schedule as f-DM?\n- To be honest, I do not quite understand why the FID on ImageNet is so high. Samples in Figure 5 looks very good to me (given that they are random samples). What CFG weight was used generate them?\n- Please, include the comparison with existing text-to-image generators. Judging by the maximum attainable CLIP score is misleading.\n- I find the results on video generation to be quite good. For how long has the model been trained and was there joint image/video training (or image pretraining) used?\n- Why do you think your model does not suffer from the \"train/test gap\" problem of CDMs and its late stages can generate meaningful images even when the low-resolution stage has not been trained yet?\n- I have a suspicion that the video generator can struggle in generating videos with moving scenes because the base low-resolution generator produces just a single frame. Could you please provide the video results for moving scenes? And in general include some mp4/gif videos in the submission (i have not found any in the supplementary).\n\nSome typos:\n- \"crtical\" => \"criticial\" (page 2)\n- \"under performs\" => \"underperforms\" (page 6)\n- \"eg\" => \"e.g.\" (page 7)\n- page 8 \u2014 no space before the bracket \"(\" in multiple places.\n\n[1] Gu et al \"f-DM: A Multi-stage Diffusion Model via Progressive Signal Transformation\""
