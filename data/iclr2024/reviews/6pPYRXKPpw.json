                "value": "The authors propose a benchmarking for imitation learning from human demonstrations. Compared to other released benchmark datasets, the authors place emphasis on using human demonstrations and those demonstrations covering diverse behaviors.  The argument for doing so is because human demonstratinos inherently have some noise if the teleoperator differs, if people have different levels of expertise, etc. The goal is also to propose a quantitative measure of diverse behavior.\n\nThe proposal for this is to assume there exists a space $\\mathcal{B}$ of discrete behavior descriptions $\\beta \\in \\mathcal{B}$ (i.e. for pushing, whether we are pushing red to red or red to green and in what order). Our demonstrations define a $p(\\beta)$ distribution of how often different behaviors appear. A learned policy $\\pi$ will induces its own $\\pi(\\beta)$ distribution of behaviors, and similarity is measured by $KL(\\pi(\\beta) || p(\\beta))$. This is simplified to a uniform distribution for $p(\\beta)$ in all experiments, with entropy scaled to lie in range $[0,1]$. This reduces to $H(\\pi) = - \\sum \\pi(\\beta) \\log_{|B|}\\pi(\\beta)$\n\nDiversity is further defined as achieving many behaviors from the same initial state $s_0$, giving the conditional behavior entropy of\n\n$$\nH(\\pi(\\beta|s_0)) \\approx -\\frac{1}{S_0} \\sum_{s_0} \\sum_{\\beta} \\pi(\\beta|s_0) \\log_{|B|} \\pi(\\beta|s_0)\n$$\n\nSince the $p(s_0)$ distribution is unknown, this is approximated by Monte Carlo estimates using $S_0$ samples of the initial state.\n\nThe proposed benchmark is implemented in MuJoCo using a Panda robot and mostly consists of block moving tasks. A variety of imitation learning methods are tried, varying from pure MLPs to history-aware methods and diffusion policies. Experiments are also conduted on history length and on size of dataset."

                "value": "The fact that different behaviors must be enumerated ahead of time is a large limitation of the proposed behavior-level entropy measure. I also found the KL-divergence to be a bit unmotivated. This paper assumes the demonstration dataset is always uniformly distributed among all behaviors, but in cases where the demonstration dataset is not uniformly distributed, it's not clear to me if KL divergence is the right measure to use. (We would expect a good learning method to have low KL, but if the demo dataset is skewed, we may still prefer a policy that is uniform across behaviors, even if this has higher KL than identicall matching the skewed distribution.) It seems like the entire discussion about KL is pointless and it would be more straightforward to just use the behavior entropy definition.\n\nSetting aside this for the moment, the paper also does not ever make a claim that multimodal policies would be good. Success rate need not be correlated with high behavior entropy - as argued by the experiment results, deterministic policies can still achieve okay success rate without diverse behavior. And hypothetically, you could have a 100% success rate policy that only follows a singular behavior $\\beta$. Such a policy may even be preferred (i.e. in factory automation, repeatable behavior given initial conditions is desired.)\n\nArguably, the paper is just about measuring this quantity, rather than arguing why it matters, but I would have appreciated some argument on this front."

                "value": "Overall I feel the paper is okay, despite the flaws it does make some strides towards focusing on diversity of behavior. But could the authors comment on where conditional imitation learning falls into the picture. In the pushing task for example, if the 4 behaviors are known ahead of time, you could imagine conditioning the policy on a 1-hot with 4 values for \"push X1 to Y1, push X2 to Y2\", and that would allow a deterministic policy to achieve any of the behaviors assuming a perfect learning method. What is the argument for why we cannot or should not do something where we provide additional context to the policy on how we want the task to be performed?"

However, such algorithms are only recently gaining traction, and such there does not exist many benchmarks for properly comparing them. This situation is what D3IL aims to resolve, by creating a new benchmark to evaluate and compare imitation learning algorithms capable of learning multi-modal behavior.\n\nThe paper is divided the following sections: first the authors introduce the diversity metric used to evaluate the algorithms, which is an important component since the diverse, multi-modal behavior require a good notion of \"coverage\" of the behaviors. Then, they introduce the environments, baseline algorithms, and follow up by showing the performance of the algorithms and architectures on the tasks, both on terms of success rate and behavior diversity. Finally, they run a host of ablation experiments, such as limited data and impact of historical information."

The list of baseline algorithms is also quite comprehensive, and covers the list of recent important developments in the space.\n3.

This is a major negative for this paper because we are being asked to judge it without being able to understand how easy it may be to run new algorithms against this benchmark.\n- Another primary criticism is that all five environments are very simple tabletop environments, and thus the complexity of the algorithm needed to solve that may not be quite high. A better benchmark would involve multiple kinds of environments, involving 2D/3D environments, potentially with different intractable elements.\n- One critical component missing from the evaluation is the required forward pass time or control frequency of the algorithms, which to my understanding is one of the largest disadvantages of diffusion-based models."
