The paper is technically solid and clearly written, with aligned theory and experiments.\n\nOriginality: The paper offers novel theoretical results on the inherent limitations of temperature scaling based on distributional assumptions. While temperature scaling is widely used, formal characterization of when it provably fails is new. The conditions identified are also intuitive and realistic.\n\nQuality: The theoretical results are informative. [Note: I am not an expert in theory though, and I didn't check the proof]. The experiments cleanly validate the theory on both synthetic data and real image benchmarks. The proposed d-Mixup method is interesting. Overall the paper reflects quality research.\n\nClarity: The problem is motivated well and background provided. The writing clearly explains the theories, assumptions, experiments, and connections between them. Figures aid understanding. The paper is well organized.\n\nSignificance: Calibration is critical for uncertainty aware models, but little theory exists. This paper significantly advances understanding of an important technique. The insights on training procedures are impactful for future work."

The paper considers the ERM interpolator set of models, where there's clear separation between the prediction of top-class and the rest. In this case temperature scaling is failing to produce the desired behavior of equal prediction on the overlapping portion of the two classes. On the other hand, training with mixing loss is able to capture the overlapping behavior and significantly improve ECE."

Based on table 2, we see that mixing is actually negative for NLL when classes are relatively separate, but only show performance improvement as the overlap increase. I also believe that the model performance would not be strictly better as we increase the degree of mixing, not to mention the additional computational complexity. Intuitively, the optimal d should have to do with the structure of overlapping in the dataset. I think it would be beneficial for the authors to have a more in-depth discussion on the choice of mixing in practice. Discounting the additional regularization effect, is it reasonable to only have the regular mixup when only two classes overlap at a time?"

Since the temperature scaling has been very successful in post-hoc calibration, this paper is interesting for pointing out its limitations and find under some conditions it provably fails to achieve good calibration. Furthermore, the authors find that the performance of temperature scaling degrades with the amount of overlap between classes, and asymptotically becomes no better than random when there are a large number of classes. This paper also studies a specific training-time calibration technique mixup and finds that it can lead to reasonably good calibration performance under the same conditions."
