In the paper, they assumed each network agent has local policies and local reward functions, and the goal is to estimate the sum of rewards over all agents with linear local approximation parameters that can be shared with connected neighbors only. In the analysis, they first captured the stochastic algorithm by its continuous-time ODE counterpart, then consider the linear system as the primal-dual gradient dynamics and prove the convergence results through the Lyapunov method applied to the gradient dynamics. The author considered both constant and diminishing step-sizes and both iid and Markovian observation models in their results. Different from previous works, the modified the proof to make the results hold when the graph Laplacian of the associated network graph is not doubly stochastic matrix."

In the paper they proved the convergence results for the constant and diminishing step size, but in the simulation section, both figures are for constant step size. I expect seeing diminishing step size case in the main body of the paper.\n\u2022\tThe third one is that the analysis doesn't feel very original. The main difference from the cited existing papers from my understanding are a linear mapping and a multiplication of LL^+. Also, the results rely on the relationship between the smallest and largest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian, and I don\u2019t know how many network graphs can meet those requirements.\n\u2022\tThere are several other definitions that are not clear, see below."

This is an important contribution of your paper, but I still don\u2019t know what kind of networks correspond to a doubly stochastic matrix and what kind of networks do not. So I don\u2019t know how significant the contribution is.\n\u2022\tIn the proof of theorem 4.2, when using constant step-size, the convergence results rely on the \\lambda_max and \\lambda_min of the network graph, and the choice of step-size also is based on the \\lambda_max. I don\u2019t know how many network graphs can meet the requirements on lambda max and min. Also, you provided an existing bound on lambda_max, so how hard is it to find the lambda_max and how hard is it to find a working eta since you require the eta\u22481/ \\lambda_max?\n\u2022\tThe citation when you mentioned total variation distance, ergodic and geometric decaying rate is confusing, you may want to cite the original paper that introduced them instead of a recent paper."
