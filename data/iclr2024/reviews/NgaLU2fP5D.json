                "value": "1. The method's description is not sufficiently clear. As indicated in the appendix, PSI-KT also employs neural networks to generate cognitive parameters. However, the main body of the paper only briefly touches upon this aspect, potentially leading to the misconception that PSI-KT is not a deep learning approach.\n2. The experimental setup lacks persuasiveness. As demonstrated in Table 1, two datasets contain over 10,000 learners, yet the authors chose to use only 100-1,000 learners as training data. Conducting experiments with a small dataset may unfairly disadvantage deep learning baselines, which can effectively leverage the abundance of available data. The reasoning provided, \"to simulate real-world data constraints in education,\" may not hold in the context of the vast amount of student learning data generated today.\n3. The introduction of interpretable KT methods is not comprehensive. For instance, recent approaches like IKT, ICKT, and QIKT [1, 2, 3] incorporate interpretable psychological and cognitive modules into their methods. These relevant methods are not referenced in this paper, let alone included as baselines in the experiments.\n4. The assessment of the model's interpretability is not entirely convincing. The limited dimensionality of hidden learner representations in deep learning methods (e.g., DKT, AKT) at just 16 may constrain the neural networks' capabilities. Furthermore, there is no supporting evidence indicating that the learner representations of PSI-KT and these deep learning baselines capture the same underlying student features, making direct comparisons less rational.\n5. Perhaps conducting case studies of PSI-KT could offer a more intuitive understanding of its interpretability, such as visualizing trends in students' knowledge mastery, as shown in Figure 1(a)."

The explanation provided, \"to simulate real-world data constraints in education,\" may benefit from additional clarification.\n2. Could the authors consider using more recent interpretable deep learning methods like QIKT as their baseline comparisons? Doing so could enhance the credibility of the study.\n3. Is there a specific reason why the authors did not provide case studies to visually demonstrate the model's interpretability, as has been done in previous KT research?\n4. Could the authors elaborate on the detailed rationale behind using mutual information between PSI-KT's learned parameters and the hidden vectors of baselines to measure interpretability? Further explanation would enhance the understanding of the experiments."

Although the authors have conducted an extensive array of analytical and validation experiments, there is a notable absence of ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two proposed motivations in the paper, namely cognitive traits and the prerequisite relationship graph, on PSI-KT. Furthermore, given the mention of the use of the prerequisite graph in the paper, it seems somewhat inadequate not to include some explicit baseline models that utilize knowledge concept graphs for comparison."
