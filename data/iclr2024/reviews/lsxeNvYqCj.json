Current setting assumes that arms decide their own strategies with knowledge of algorithm in advance (which seems strong to me), and the algorithm is a plain UCB estimating fixed $s$ and $\\mu$. However, this problem has the intrinsic of an adversarial strategy selection, that can be well captured by adversarial bandit, in which case, arms dynamically select strategies based on history and thus omit the requirement of knowing algorithm in advance. More importantly, adversarial bandit constructs the interaction between arm strategy selection and learner recommendation/elimination, thus captures real trade-off between incentivizing all arms to be truthful and recommending only the best arms, while current model does not.\n* There is confusion in algorithm design and many counterintuitive regret analysis (which I have listed in Questions), that make me doubt the soundness of the results."

                "value": "Modeling:\n* The proposed model assumes that arms are aware of the algorithm that the learner is going to run in advance. Is this realistic in practice? Further, it is assumed that arms will pick CTRs that form a NE in $NE(M)$, according to Theorem 5.2, does it imply that arms have to know $K$ and $T$ in advance?\u00a0I recommend presenting how to pick CTRs to form a NE in $NE(M)$. If $K$, $T$, and algorithm $M$ are required to form a NE before running $M$, it appears that the assumption is too strong.\n* According to the description of Model 1, strategies $\\bf{\\it{s}}$ are picked in advance and stay fixed when running $M$, then, the goal of $M$ becomes maximizing learner's utility by estimating $\\bf{\\it{s}}$ and $\\bf{\\mu}$. In this case, why are we interested in strong and weak strategic regret, as they take into account the distribution of strategy selection while strategies are just unknown constants throughout the execution of $M$?\n\nAlgorithm design:\n* I did not see the explicit definition of $\\hat{\\mu}^t_i$. Is it an estimate of $\\mu_i$? If yes, then it is non-trivial to explicitly state how to get $\\hat{\\mu}^t_i$ by observing $c_{t, i_t}$ and $r_{t, i_t}$ at each round, and I wonder if Step 4 in UCB-S maximizing $\\bar{\\mu}^t_i$ aligns with the goal of maximizing $u(\\cdot)$.\n* The algorithm UCB-S only estimates strategies and eliminates bad arms that seem like clickbait, while arms are responsible to pick proper strategies that are less likely to get eliminated. Although it might be tricky for arms to pick strategies, it seems to me that the design of UCB-S is straightforward UCB.\n\nRegret analysis:\n* In Section 4, it is not surprising that $(s, \\mu)-$Oracle has linear weak strategic regret, since weak strategic regret considers the strategy distribution $\\bf{\\sigma}$ while the oracle considers only a realization of $\\bf{\\sigma}$ (In fact, UCB-S also considers a realization of $\\bf{\\sigma}$ instead of $\\bf{\\sigma}$, so I doubt whether UCB-S achieves sublinear strong strategic regret as stated in Theorem 5.3).\n* I cannot go through all the proofs, but I can hardly follow the proof of Proposition 4.1. In the first glance, it seems to me that the proof is self-contradictory: in Case 1, it is stated that $u(s'+\\varepsilon, \\mu_{i^*})<u^*_{j^*}$ with $\\varepsilon>0, s'+\\varepsilon\\leq 1$ contradicts the continuity of $u(s, \\mu)$ in $s$, while the proof of Case 2 is based on the statement $u(s'', \\mu_{i^*})<u^*_{j^*}$ with $s''>s'$. Please double check the proof.\n* Theorem 5.3 and Corollary 5.4 provide a problem-dependent and a problem-independent regret upper bound respectively. It is counterintuitive that the problem-dependent bound is larger than the problem-independent bound, as it is often the case that problem-dependent bound is smaller since it additionally takes into account distributional information.\n* As previously mentioned, UCB-S considers a realization of $\\bf{\\sigma}$ as a fixed unknown parameter, and performs straightforward UCB, so I feel like the problem-dependent regret upper bound in Theorem 5.3 can be tightened to order $\\log T$. It is of interest to provide a problem-dependent lower bound to show the tightness of the upper bound."

The vendors in the system (e.g., content providers in a recommender system) are modeled as strategic arms. Each vendor/arm has a bernoulli reward distribution with fixed mean, and can choose their clickthrough rate. There is a tradeoff in the utility between higher CTRs (which yields higher engagement) and truthfully reporting a ctr that reflects the true reward (disincentivizing clickbait which is modeled as inflating the CTR for low quality content).\n\nThe authors show that ignoring vendor incentives can lead to high regret and design an incentive-aware modification of UCB based on thresholding the reported CTRs to derive low-regret guarantees. They characterize the equilibrium strategies of the agents. Finally, they validate the model and techniques via experiments."

                "value": "Why does the strategic agent behind an arm get to choose the CTR? Is that a realistic assumption? For example, how could a video creator on Youtube choose their CTR? They could direct effort into improving their content which could contribute to increasing CTR, but allowing the agent to choose the CTR as a fixed value seems like a fairly unrealistic assumption. \n\nThe strategic aspect is interesting, but one limitation of the model is that the agents are in a sense \u201cstuck\u201d at their particular reward mean $\\mu_i$. So an agent\u2019s incentive is solely based on strategically choosing a CTR based on the mechanics of the utility function and learning algorithm. But you would expect that realistically an agent might also put in effort into improving $\\mu_i$ (e.g., by improving or changing the quality/genre/tone of content they are producing in a recommender system setting). I feel like that\u2019s an important component that would make this model more compelling, and studying the interplay between clickbait actions (strategically choosing $\\mu_i$) and quality-improving actions would be very interesting.\n\nI also think some more work and thought needs to be given on the formulation of agent utilities. The present results hold under some assumptions on utilities like Lipschitnzess and monotonicity of maximizers, and the utility is also based on a single-shot report of the strategically-chosen CTR which seems like a limiting assumption since the agents would probably change their behavior across time steps. But these aspects can be a good direction for future work and doesn\u2019t diminish my opinion of the paper too much."

In most real-world online recommendation systems, it is impossible for the item to get arbitrarily close to 1 click rate. There will be limits on the number of items that can appear on the webpage and there will be competition among the item providers, either through sponsors or genuinely improving the item's quality. Due to the limit, only some items will get high click rates but not all. I think the strategic MAB problem is more like an information elicitation problem than a strategic recommendation problem.\n2. The UCB-S algorithm is also unrealistic since the punishment is too harsh for any commercial platform. Specifically, the agents are permanently eliminated the first time their report doesn't fall into the estimated expected reward range, and such elimination can be false positives, especially in the early stages of the system. Such false positive eliminations can cause severe regression in brand reputation. I suggest the authors propose alternative solutions that may involve some fixed-length cold-start process to reduce the false positive occurrences or penalize the agents in different ways (like eliminating for a certain period of time instead of permanent elimination), and present the regret bound for the alternatives.\n3. It is not easy to understand how the strategic setting in this work is different from previous works in strategic MAB, the authors should consider adding a table with each work's setting, assumptions, solution existence/uniqueness, convergence, and regret bounds to help the readers better understand the novelty.\n4. Some details should be elaborated\n(1). What is the characterization of NE under the incentive unaware platform? Is it the largest expected reward agent always plays 1 and other agents are indifferent about their strategies? If so, how does this correspond to the result in Figure 3?\n(2). Why is UCB-S having higher regret in the early stages than UCB in Figure 4? How is the y-axis value computed?\n(3). Under what conditions the NE under UCB-S are pure strategy NE/mixed strategy NE?\n5. Minor typo: page 4, \"(A3) then ensures that the from the perspective\" -> \"(A3) then ensures that from the perspective\"\n\nI'm on the fence and I think my rating is 5.5, exactly on the borderline since the limitations in the problem setting is really making the UCB-S unrealistic in actual production.

On the other hand, the setting in the experiments that each arm optimize itself by gradient descend would be more realistic one, but maybe much harder to obtain theoretical result."
