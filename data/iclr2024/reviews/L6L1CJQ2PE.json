It introduces a novel approach called the MAssive Language Model Editing Network (MALMEN). MALMEN formulates the parameter shift aggregation as a least square problem, seeking the most effective parameter shifts for all facts to be injected. This approach improves the statistical significance of the editing process, mitigating the issues of gradient accumulation and the cancellation effect. Furthermore, this paper separates the computation between the hyper-network and the language model, enabling the use of arbitrary batch sizes for both neural networks. Exceptional performance on multiple knowledge-intensive tasks is a testament to MALMEN's effectiveness."

                "value": "This paper considers a problem of knowledge editing, which involves altering the parametric knowledge of LMs without retraining them from scratch. This work specifically focuses on the scalability of hypernetwork-based approaches, which are generally considered less effective for multiple concurrent edits. The authors claim that there are two major challenges: 1) the parameter shifts could be contradictory between the set of modified facts, and 2) accommodating a large number of edits in a hypernetwork is memory demanding. This work presents an approach that addresses these challenges. \n\nConcretely, this work extends MEND (Mitchell et al., 2022) by introducing additional parameter updates specifically for linear layers in the FFNs. Assuming that the linear layers are key-value memories, the motivation behind this is to find a better single parameter shift matrix S for _m_ updates. This additional step adjust the hypernetwork output (i.e., gradients) which is not a simple sum of gradients for different inputs. When scaling up to a large number of edits, backpropagating from the meta loss to the input is costly (e.g., computing pre and post-edit losses for each edit end to end). The proposed approach decomposes the optimization process by caching pre-edit computation (after finetuning), reducing the memory usage substantially.\n\nThe experimental setup focuses on scalability (i.e., editing thousands of facts at once), and the proposed approach is applied to different model families such as encoder-only (e.g., BERT) and  decoder-only (e.g., GPT-2 and GPT-J 6B). In addition to FT and MEND baselines, GPT-J with MEMIT is included as a baseline. For evaluation, FEVER is used for BERT, and zsRE is used for GPT models, largely following prior work. For evaluation metrics, edit success (ES \u2013 how often new facts get higher probability after editing), generalization success (GS \u2013 performance on related facts), and locality success (LS \u2013 performance of unrelated facts). In summary, the experimental results show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms FT and MEND with BERT and GPT-2, and it has better scalability compared to the original MEND. When it comes with GPT-J, which is a much larger LM, it is always better than MEND but underperforms MEMIT and FT on LS, indicating that the post-edit model forgets unrelated facts."
