The evaluation primarily compares the proposed method against static neural SLAM, which may not be entirely fair. It would be beneficial to include related works as stronger baselines, including traditional SLAM methods like MID-Fusion[1] and Droid-SLAM[2], as well as NeRF SLAM methods like vMAP[3] and BundleSDF[4].\n3. Although Fig. 3 displays TSDF fusion results, these results are not reported in tables. Comparing the results with and without the motion mask, as proposed in this paper, using TSDF fusion would be valuable and should be considered a baseline method.\n4. The paper's visualization results are impressive; however, for a SLAM system, it would be preferable to include videos or real-world demonstrations as additional supplementary material.\n\n[1]Mid-fusion: Octree-based object-level multi-instance dynamic slam.
