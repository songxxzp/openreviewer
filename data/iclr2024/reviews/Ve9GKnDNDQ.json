For instance, the stego samples depicted in Figure 9 and Figure 11 of the supplement appear visually inadequate. In contrast, there are several demonstrably secure generative steganography techniques [A-D] that are able to maintain the original distribution.\n2) Slight distortions, as indicated in supplementary materials like image storage quantization, can result in significant performance degradation. Moreover, it's relatively easy to distinguish between AIGC-generated images and natural images [E-F]. Thus, in terms of Security and Robustness, Diffusion-Stego might be less practical in real-world applications.\n3) The three mapping rules are hand-crafted, which is too simple. I think using MLPs or some lightweight networks to learn mapping rules may be a better choice.\n\nRef:\n\n[A] Cachin C.

If stego images are synthesized images with secret information, how can third parties obtain them?\n2. In the comparative experiments, both GSN and S2IRT use generated cover images and generated stego images to train the steganalyzer. What is the purpose of the author using real images for training?\n3. Is there any theoretical derivation that can prove that the zm after message projection follows a Gaussian distribution, or is there any related experimental evidence?\n4. In the experiments, in what format are the images generated by GSN and S2IRT saved, and has there been a standardized format? In reference [32], the images are saved in PNG format, why is it not used in the comparative experiments?\n5. The author mentions, \"The MC projection performs higher extracted message accuracy than the MN projection and better sample quality than the MB projection.\" The MC mapping method produces better image quality, but when generating stego images with the stable diffusion, why use the MB mapping method instead of the MC mapping?"

Apart from the usage of the diffusion model, the only technical part is the message mapping strategy, which is rather limited and does not involved any learning process. \n\n2. Experimental issue. There have been studies showing that, once the training images are available, it is farely easy to training a classifier to distinguish the diffusion model generated images from the real images[1]. However, according to the reported results, it seems that the classifier can hardly spot out the diffusion model generated images from the real images. As a matter of fact, in generative image steganography, a common knowledge is that it is almost impossible to generate stego-images with the same distribution as the real images. This is why we always evaluate the undetectability of the stego-images in terms of AIGC images without secret vs. stego-AIGC images.  \n[1] Zhu et al, GenImage: A Million-Scale Benchmark for Detecting AI-Generated Image, arXiv 2023.\n\n3. Limited application value. Most of the images transmitted over the internet are in compressed format like the JPEG. As a matter of fact, most of the social network platforms do not allow the uploading of uncompressed images like the PNG. Therefore, the application value of such a scheme is rather limited.\n\n4. Issues of illigal data extraction. Anyone who knows the mapping machenism will be able to do the message recovery, isn't it?"
