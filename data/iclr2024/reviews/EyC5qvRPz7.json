Furthermore, the work lacks a discussion in which cases basic assumptions and necessary conditions hold. Consequently, the soundness and practical value of the proposed method remains unclear.\n\nIn more detail: It remains unclear precisely how the synthetic coarse annotations were generated. The nature of the coarse labels is, however, crucial for the success of the proposed approach. E.g., if coarse labels are generated by a constant amount of morphological growing of the true labels, the necessary properties of success, as outlined by Tanno, appear to be violated, namely that the (pixel-wise) confusion matrices (true as well as predicted) need to be diagonally dominant. To give a concrete example, a systematic error like, e.g., an over-segmentation of the foreground by two pixels and resp. undersegmentation of the background by two pixels, does not appear to be \"disentangleable\" from the true label distribution by the proposed approach. \n\nThe authors do not discuss whether their synthetic coarse annotations entail confusion matrices that satisfy the necessary diagonal dominace conditions. More generally, they do not discuss which types of real-world coarse annotations would satisfy the necessary conditions. Furthermore, it is not discussed whether the assumption of statistical independence of label noise across pixels, as stated in 3.2, holds for the employed coarse annotations, and if not what this would entail.\n\nSpecifically, how coarse annotations were generated remains unclear as follows: \n-- For MNIST it remains unclear if synthetic labels were generated by constant morphological growing (in addition to the random fracturing, which is not critical). Furthermore, it remains unclear whether expert labels were used to derive coarse labels (as stated in 4.2), or whether thresholded images were used (as stated in 4.1).\n-- For CityScapes, it remains unclear whether expert labels (as stated in 4.2) or coarse polygonal annotations as provided with the data (as stated in 4.1) were used to derive coarse labels. Furthermore, the precise way in which morphological operations were applied to the former is not described.\n-- For the medical data, the precise way in which morphological operations were applied to the expert consensus annotations is not described.\n\n\n** Further detailed comments **\n\nFigure 1: the arrows after transformation of u(x) appear to be wrongly conected: The dotted line should be between \"Noisy Negative Coarse Annotation\" and \"Predicted Noisy Negative Coarse Distribution\", and should be labelled \"CE Loss\"; The coninuous line should lead to \"Predicted Noisy Negative Coarse Distribution\" instead of \"Noisy Negative Coarse Annotation\"\n\nThe introduction states that \"drawing coarse annotations [...] needs only similar effort and time as the scribble and box-level labelling, and can be conducted by non-experts\"; It remains unclear / is not discussed though why expert knowledge would *not* be required for coarse labelling in cases where it *is* required for accurate labelling; Furthermore, the claim that coarse annotations are similarly cheap as scribbles and boxes is not substantiated by any respective citation or evaluation.\n\nRelated work that employs confidence filtering to deal with noisy labels is not discussed, e.g., DivideMix (Li et al., ICLR 2020)\n\nThe term \"objective\" is often used where \"object\" appears more appropriate\n\nThe annotation in 3.1 is somewhat inconsistent: image indices are sometimes n and sometimes i, please fix\nFurthermore, S(x_i) is not clearly defined; it seems to be a subset of \\mathcal{Y}; please clarify\n\nIn the \"Learning with Negative Coarse Label\" subsection, 2nd paragraph, there seems to be a typo, as \"CE\" should read \"CM\"\n\nIn Figure 2, the visualization of the pixel-wise CMs in A and C are not clear -- how are the (2x2?) CMs encoded via the color map? Furthermore, it is unclear how the figure shows the assumed behavior described in the last paragraph on page 7; This paragraph is very hard to parse; It would be very helpful if the authors could clearly describe where to look in the Figure to reveal the described behavior.\n\nThe caption of Table 1 should state that result are given for coarse labels at ratio 1 here (otherwise this needs to be deduced from comparison with Fig. 3)\n\nFigure S5 gives the impression as if training was perfomed including the validation set -- or are these results on the training set? or are the respective coarse annotations only shown to provide some examples? please clarify in the caption\n\nThe citation style should be fixed as described in the provided template in most cases"

The latter CNN achieves its task by determining pixel-specific confusion matrices for each image. In contrast to earlier approaches for weakly supervised segmentation that utilize coarse annotations, the proposed approach simultaneously identifies and decouples the relationships between the input images, the imprecise annotations, and the accurate segmentation labels. The performance of the method is evaluated on the MNIST, cityscape and a medical (retinal) imaging dataset."

For the retinal image dataset, the evaluation is quite unrealistic since the challenge with coarse segmentation is mainly the variation in how deep the vessel trees are segmented. For example, some annotators may only annotate the major vessels, others will annotate smaller vessels further down in the vessel tree. This is not taken into account at all.\n\nAnother fundamental weakness is that the coarse segmentations are synthetically generated by performing morphological transformations. To me, it is clear that such a synthethically generated can be learnt and corrected for. However, this is not what happens when human annotators perform coarse segmentations. The authors try to simulate the behaviours of different annotators (section 4.5) but unfortunately, this is not very realistic either."

The combination of these two parts yields the predicted coarse label, allowing the model to be trained with noisy coarse labels. As the training progresses, the output of the Segmentation Network gradually approaches the ground truth label.
