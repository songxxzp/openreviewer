The main idea is to formulate a Markov chain that converts a high-quality image to its low-quality counterpart. The transition kernel of this Markov chain is constructed through the ratio and residual between the high-quality and low-quality images, which provides a general expression that can effectively handle various degradation processes. Experiments show that the method outperforms existing image restoration methods and achieves superior performance on multiple image restoration tasks."

                "value": "I would like the authors to comment on these major points.\n\n1. The paper motivates the method through the classical linear degradation model: $y = Ax + n$. Then the idea of the residual is to model $(y-x) = (A-Id)x + n$, where Id is the Identity matrix.  But in the paper this is written as $(y-x) = (A-E)x + n$, with $E$ the \"all-ones\" matrix. This doesn't seem correct. \n\n2. In the model, $y = Ax_0 + n$,  $A$ is a matrix (or linear operator). What does it mean to adopt $A = y /x_0$? This doesn't seem well defined. The same applies to $ln(y + E)$ in Eq(8). \n\n3. Connection to published work. In particular,\n  - In Delbracio and Milanfar, the diffusion (also known as a Bridge) is directly modeled as $x_t = (1-t)x + ty$. In the current linear formulation this leads to $x_t = ((1-t)Id + tA)x + tn$. This seems related to the formulation of the authors are proposing. I would like the authors to comment on the connection. \n\n  - Also, I would like the authors to comment on the connection to Whang et al (2022), DvSR since in this work the idea is also to model a residual (but also colearn the initial base point of the degradation to with the residual is computed)."
