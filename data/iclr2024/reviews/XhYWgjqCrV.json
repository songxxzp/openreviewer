Analysis of the factors  why existing networks results in an inappropriate composition of local and global context is still lacking.\n- It is thought that the self-attention mechanism is more adaptable than typical gate attention. Why does ViT fail to learn middle-order interactions when self-attention is present?\n- For the purpose of capturing low-, middle-, and high-order interactions, Moga Block uses three parallel branches. To confirm that the model concentrates more on the middle-order as anticipated, it would be preferable to give the gate values (or attention map).\n- The substration $Y-GAP(Y)$, which \"forces the network against its implicitly preferred extreme-order interactions,\" is the main function of FD. Why does the CA block not include this operation?\n- Wrong markup in Fig.5, i.e., two $1:0:0$.\n\nOthers:\n- Will MogaNet be less robust because low-order interation \"represents common and widely shared local patterns with great robustness\"?\n- It would be better if figures following the order they appear in the main-body text.\n- It would be interesting to know how the losses (presented in [r1]) and MogaNet pitted against (or collaborate with) each other, because both supervision signal and structure design matter for deep neural networks.\n- The two expressions before and after Equation 1 contradict each other, i.e., \"in the same shape\" and \"downsampled features\".\n\nI would be glad to raise my rating if thoughtful responses are presented.\n\n[r1] H.

And why three different DWConv layers with dilation ratios can capture low, middle, and high-order interactions?

Therefore, could the authors give more detailed and rigorous correspondings between analysis in Sec. 3 and module design in Sec. 4?\n\n-: From the architecture perspective, the proposed MogaNet exploit multiple depth-wise convolutions for token mixing and channel attention-based FFN for channel mixing. The idea on multiple depth-wise convolutions for token mixing was used in RepLKNet, while channel attention-based FFN was explored in LocalViT and DHVT. So I have a bit doubt on technological novelty of core ideas on designing overall architectures of MogaNet.
