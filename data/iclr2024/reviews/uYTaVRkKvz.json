It extends the \"unfolded GNN\" line of research, where GNNs are formulated by an outer loss function to be minimized, and an inner energy function which is minimized layer-by-layer. In this inner energy function, a \"base model\" (e.g., an MLP over the nodes) is defined, and the graph layer is defined as a balance between deviating from this base model and smoothing the signal over the graph. \n\nTo scale it up, in the proposed MuseGNN the authors combine the idea of sampling subgraphs from the original graph with the unfolded GNN model. A new unfolded model is defined by running the original unfolded model on each subgraph, augmented by an additional regularization term that enforces similarity across subgraphs of the nodes' representations.\n\nThey show several convergence analyses on the model of different types. On the experimental side, they show the model is able to achieve better results on very large datasets with slightly higher training time than the baselines."

In addition, the authors are never showing examples of this.\n\nI have not found any analysis on the memory of the approach, which requires storing predictions and auxiliary embeddings for multiple subgraphs. In addition, the authors should provide an ablation study on the number of subgraphs that are chosen.\n\nIn the related works, several papers have proposed subgraph-based GNNs to improve the expressiveness of standard message-passing.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. One notable weak point of the paper's experimental evaluation is its limited comparison to a rather outdated set of baseline models. While the paper does present compelling results in terms of the proposed MuseGNN's performance, the absence of more contemporary and diverse baseline models hinders the thorough assessment of the method's competitiveness and applicability in the current research landscape. Graph neural networks have seen significant advancements in recent years, resulting in a multitude of state-of-the-art models and techniques that offer superior performance across various graph-related tasks. Focusing solely on older and limited baseline models (GCN, GraphSage, GAT) from the past can potentially lead to a skewed perspective of MuseGNN's relative performance in the current state of the art. A more comprehensive comparison against a broader range of modern baseline models would provide a more accurate and up-to-date assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of MuseGNN. I provide some example papers [1,2,3] that can be used as baselines below. Moreover, in the ogb leaderboard https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/leader_nodeprop/#ogbn-arxiv there are many new baselines.\n\n2. Another weak point in the paper lies in its motivation and justification for employing unfolded GNNs, especially for those who may not be well-versed in this specific research area. While the paper briefly discusses the benefits of using unfolded GNNs and emphasizes their role in enhancing explainability by distinguishing the relative importance of node features and graph structure in predictive tasks, the argument remains somewhat vague and underdeveloped. The paper primarily suggests that the use of unfolded GNNs can help reveal whether node features or graph structure hold more significance for predictions. However, it lacks a more thorough and nuanced discussion of why this is an important aspect to investigate, and how this contributes to the broader field of graph-based machine learning or the potential practical implications.\n\n\n\nReferences: \n\n[1] Rusch, T.

Can the authors provide specific instances or use cases where this enhanced explainability has a direct impact on decision-making or model interpretability?\n\n3. Can the authors elaborate on the practical scenarios where distinguishing the importance of node features and graph structure is particularly valuable? How might this knowledge influence real-world applications, and can the paper provide more concrete examples?\n\n4.

                "value": "1. The paper emphasizes \\textbf{Interpretable} in the title and illustrates the explanality of energy minimizers. The key concern is the energy minimization is not aligned with the common concept of GNNs interpretation. For example, some of existing works of interpretable GNNs highlight neighborhood structure leading to the node label classification. The superficial conclusion of node embedding information stemming from the node itself or neighbors makes no sense to the real interpretable applications. \n2. In addition, the absence of case study to validate the explanations provided by the energy function raises questions about one of the paper's main claims.\n3. The incorporation of the energy minimization into GNNs is not novel. The Dirichilet energy of node embeddings, i.e., the second term in Eq.(2), has been extensively studied in graph domains and GNNs. For example, it has been used to analyze over-smoothing issue in [1]. Following this work, several novel GNNs to optimize this energy function have been proposed. The constraint of closeness to base model embedding, i.e., the first term of Eq. (2), has been implicitly included in models like SIGN [2], SAGN [3], DAGNN[4]. \n\n[1] Cai, Chen, and Yusu Wang. \"A note on over-smoothing for graph neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.13318 (2020).\n[2] Rossi, Emanuele, et al. \"Sign: Scalable inception graph neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.11198 7 (2020): 15.\n[3] Sun, Chuxiong, Hongming Gu, and Jie Hu. \"Scalable and adaptive graph neural networks with self-label-enhanced training.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.09376 (2021).\n[4] Liu, Meng, Hongyang Gao, and Shuiwang Ji. \"Towards deeper graph neural networks.\" Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery & data mining. 2020."

                "value": "1. Please address the previous concerns.\n2. Present more results about ablations on $\\gamma$, i.e. results on IGB-full, the dataset where traditional GNNs with sampling technique obviously suffer a significant performance degradation, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of $M$.\n3. In Proposition 3.1, what is the definition of l(M)? What is the purpose of this proposition?\n4. According to my understanding, the main novelty of this paper is to incorporate the shared summary embedding matrix $M$ into energy to facilitate controllable linkage between the multiple embeddings that may exist for a given node appearing in different subgraphs (Because the Formula 6 is a commonly used technique for large-scale training). But existing ablation on $\\gamma$ are not sufficient to demonstrate the general effectiveness of this additional constraint term."
