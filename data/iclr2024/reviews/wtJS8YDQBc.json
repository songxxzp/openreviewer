I don't believe this claim is supported by the current experiments. The paper should clarify this contribution.\n1. Since DEER essentially learns a dynamics model that predicts a sequence of states given an initial state and sequence of actions, my understanding is that DEER still suffers the same drawbacks as model-based approaches. \n\n1. DEER seems to have an unfair advantage over the baselines in Figures 4 and 5. In particular, DEER assumes access to an offline dataset, but the baselines do not. I believe DEER could in principle train its encoder in an online fashion -- if so, then an online variant of DEER would provide a fairer comparison across algorithms. \n\n**Other Comments:\n\n1. Figure 1 and 3 are essentially the same. I suggest replacing Figure 1 with Figure 3, and then include the \u201cundelayed trajectory buffer\u201d icon from figure 1.\n    \n2.

In the abstract and conclusion, it is unclear what \u201ctasks involving delays\u201d and \u201cdelay issues\u201d mean.

I suggest clarifying that you\u2019re referring to when the learning agent receives its next observation after taking an action.\n    \n4. The paper should explicitly define \"augmented states. I believe \"augmented state\" refers the concatenation of state and action information, but this term makes me think of a synthetic data generated by a data augmentation function (e.g. a random cropping and recoloration of an image state). \n        \n5.

From my understanding, the key novelty is a framework combining \"offline-assisted online RL\" and \"Encoder in RL\". \n\n- The definition of RDDMP is quite complex and probably unrealistic. One concern is about the random delay value $z_t$ with dropping probablity $\\mu$. $z_t = d_I$ if $z_{t-1} = d_I + d_M$, which means the $d_M$ steps of delay suddenly \"disappear\".  How can this happen in reality? My suggestion is to modify it as  (this ensures that there is no sudden change of delay steps)\n\n   - $z_t = z_{t-1} - 1$ if $z_{t-1} > d_I$ and with probability $ \\mu_{catch} $\n   - $z_t = z_{t-1} + 1$ if $z_{t-1} < d_I + d_M$ and with probability $ \\mu_{lag}$\n   - $z_t = z_{t-1}$  otherwise\n\n- More implementation details should be mentioned for the baseline models (RLRD, DATS, SACAS). See the questions below.\n\n- DEER should also be compared with vanilla SAC in delay=0 case. This is important to understand the effect of pretrained encoder in deep RL and probably explain why DEER significantly outforms expert in Swimmer (Figure 4).\n\n- While the authos commented three main contributions in the end of Introduction, they seems the same thing for me -- \"We propose a framework which enhances agent performance in delayed RL tasks\".\n\n## Minor\n\n- Fonts are too small in Figure 3. I cannot recognize the subscripts on the printed paper.\n- Figure 6, 7 etc. could be more clear with different linestyles in addition to colors for color-blind-friendly visualization.\n- A table summarizing the numerical reults (including the converged task return of each task and average performance of all tasks) could help the readers get easier access to the empirical results.\n- A typo in the title \"resillient\""

Also, How many steps of actions are augmented in the state in SACAS? What are the hyperparameters and how did the authors selected them?\n\n- In the end of the first paragraph, it was mentioned minor delays markedly amplifies the risk in self-driving. Is there any reference? Following this question, are there more examples (better with data) of practical scenarios that suffers heavily from delays?\n\n- Why the performance of DEER is sensitive to dimension of latent representation? In particular, why dim=512 results in significantly worse performance in Walker2D (Figure 6)? My expectation is large dimension should work better or similar. A potentially related work is (Ota et al. 2020)\n\nOverall, the being touched problem, i.e., delay in deep RL is a quite important problem and the efforts toward solving this problem should be valuable contribution to the deep learning and robotics community. While there are some tacts in the current version of the manuscript. I am happy to discuss with the authors and will increase my score if my concerns are well addressed.\n\n\n### REF\n- Ota K, Oiki T, Jha D, et al.
