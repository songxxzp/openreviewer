The term \"redundant\" is frequently used in the paper to describe neurons with a lower likelihood of firing. However, the usage of \"redundant\" warrants careful consideration because a) even though certain neurons might fire infrequently, they could possess distinct functionalities in specific contexts, and b) if two high-firing neurons exhibit identical firing patterns, they could be considered redundant.\n\n3. The rationale behind drawing inspiration from the definitions of depolarization and hyperpolarization for this study appears somewhat tenuous. The paper lacks a clear explanation of plasticity that aligns with the proposed method. If we were to interpret the membrane potential as a hidden layer of firing rates, then the concept of plasticity could be analogous to the principle that reduced firing correlates with decreased wiring, reminiscent of Hebb's rule. Alternatively, from a different perspective, the pruning might be seen as an L1 regularization applied to hidden values (the membrane potential) rather than directly on firing rates. This raises the question: is the novelty of this research rooted in the integration of pruning with regrowth?"

The neurons could also experience continuous repolarization/hyperpolarization and maintain a negative potential with a large magnitude (L1 norm), which makes them silent and can thereby be removed without influencing the input of post-synaptic neurons. The application of the L1 norm on membrane potential seems to suggest they assume only neurons with potential near zero are insignificant, which for me is not heuristically comprehensive.\n2. The *selective growth* part shares insights with RigL [1], which employs gradient as a criterion for recovering pruned weights. Proper discussions/citations should be made in these parts.\n3. The DVS-CIFAR10 experiments shown in Table 1 do not follow the same network architecture as the counterpart methods. It's hard to directly compare results across different architectures since they could possess a far distinct potential for compression from each other even when the number of parameters is close.\n\n[1] Utku Evci, et al. \"Rigging the lottery: Making all tickets winners.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. 2020."

For example, they mention that the PCA-based method uses a time step of 25, much larger than SCA\u2019s 4. However, these are training parameters and the authors could simply conduct pruning experiments with the same timestep of 25 to maintain a fair comparison. Larger training timesteps only suggest a probably higher performance for dense SNNs, which cannot serve as a clue for comparing pruning algorithms.\n2. Why do authors believe structural pruning is essential for energy-efficient deployment on neuromorphic hardware? Event-based chips could behave completely differently in computation and storage patterns from GPU or CPU. The authors should provide more firm evidence for the necessity of exploring structural pruning in SNNs."

The authors say \n> Drawing inspiration from this biological mechanism,\nneurons with lower polarization levels can be considered less important, and their removal has a\nrelatively minor impact on the network\u2019s accuracy.\n\nIt would be good if the authors could give more intuition on this statement\n\n5. I am also not able to understand Fig 3(b) - why do only three of them change (black, green and yellow) and the other three do not change at all with epochs? \n\n6. [Minor] The structure of the experimental sections seems haphazard.
