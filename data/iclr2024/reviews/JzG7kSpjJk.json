                "value": "- First, I think the presentation of the paper is very hard to follow. The authors choose to write a paragraph rather using mathematical notations that can make the paper easier to follow. At core, given the activation as $WX$ with $W\\in R^{q\\times p}$, they propose to have $p$ quantizers where quantizer $i$ corresponds to column $i$ of $W$, rather than having $q$ of them each corresponding to a row of $W$. Other examples include using the term \"Activation\". Is activation referring to $WX$ or $X$? Or $W$ which are the weights? Isn't this work trying to circumvent outliers in $W$? Then why they talk about activation outliers in page 3? The method does not even seem to detect outliers, then why talk so much about outliers?  Overall, I find the paper confusing and hard to follow.\n\n- It seems transposing the direction of quantization helps with accuracy. But then what happens in terms of implementing this method in practice? Note that this per-IC quantization method is not a drop-in replacement for per-OC, or at least if it is, that requires to be substantiated with experiments. As far as I could tell there are no experiments on hardware implementation and inference time performance of the proposal. The hardware implementation is very briefly mentioned in Section 3.2, but the explanation actually creates more questions than answers, as it contain a bunch of new notations that are never properly defined. The authors say \"With per-IC quantization, we can maximize the performance of the GPTQ algorithm by using reordering for free without the static groups constraint.\" which again I don't think is numerically supported. \n\nOverall, I think the paper needs some rewriting to make it easier to understand, and several experiments to show the benefits of per-IC in inference time."
