                "value": "The authors proposed a strategy to dynamically change the scale of classifier-guidance during the reverse diffusion process for the generation of pixel-based sketches. For this purpose, they empirically designed a scaling indicator and a residual sketch to achieve the optimal guidance scale needed at the current diffusion stage. The scaling indicator is to assess the recognizability and complexity of current generative results. The residual sketch x_rs (x_t, s) is to evaluate the extent to which the guidance scale s will impact the generative process. The guidance scale s is optimized to enforce the residual sketch to be synchronized with the scale indicator. Moreover, they adopted a three-phase sampling strategy to enhance the sketch diversity and quality. Experiments demonstrated the superiority of their approach in the realm of sketch generation."

The scale adaptive classifier-guided diffusion process seems useful and attractive, however, the scaling indicator and residual sketch are proposed mainly based on their experience in the field of sketch generation. In my opinion, it may rely on the simple structure of sketch. I wonder if similar methods can be applied to other data modalities, such as natural images.\n2. Equation 4 appears to be dubious. I understand the point that the residual sketch should be synchronized with the scale indicator. However, are they on the same numerical scale and is it appropriate to directly apply mean squared error for optimization? I believe that a more rigorous discussion or proof is needed based on their definitions (Formula 2 and 3).\n3. The contribution \u201cthree-phase sampling strategy\u201d has been proven to be effective but it is merely a simple technique for diffusion process and the innovation may be limited.\n4. Using the fraction of stroke pixels to the whole canvas to evaluate the sketch complexity is oversimplified."

So are there any obstacles to using classifier-guidance for vector-based diffusion? It also seems feasible in principle.\n3. In Equ 2, are the settings of the three hyperparameters obtained through experiments or are there some empirical principles?\n4. In Equ. 4, why do different images in the same batch share the same scale?"
