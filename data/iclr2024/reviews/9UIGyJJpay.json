For each pair of interacting frames, the coordinates of both sets of virtual atoms in the destination frame are used to compute attention weights and message values. The aggregated message is then used to update the node features and virtual atom coordinates. In experiments, the authors swap out the architectures of PiFold and FrameDiff and achieve significantly improved performance under identical experimental settings."

Particularly, if we replace IPA in AlphaFold/ESMFold with VFN, does the performance persist? It should not be too hard to run this experiment since the structural module is not very large.\n* The claims about a \"universal encoder\" are not well-supported. It would be nice to see actual experiments where sidechains are also involved.\n* From the novelty standpoint, an argument can be made that the architecture is similar enough to IPA and / or PiFold to count against its technical significance.\n\nJustification for score: I think this is a good paper and am happy to recommend acceptance if the Questions are fully addressed."

Subsequently, these backbone frames are fed into the inverse folding network to obtain the corresponding protein sequence for the designed structure.\" If I didn't understand wrongly, this means the author first design the protein structure  and then generate protein sequence based on the designed structures.  Therefore, it's kind of like a pipeline. However, in Table 1, for the sequence design task, the author only compared with the inverse folding models, say sequence design based on real structure instead of designed structures. I think a more fair comparison should compare to baseline like structure design model plus inverse folding model, such as FrameDiff + ProteinMPNN, RFDiffusion [1]+ProteinMPNN and also some structure-sequence co-design model like ProtSeed [2]. \n\n[1] De novo design of protein structure and function with RFdiffusion.

For example, [2] for sequence part. For structure design part, the author only compares with FrameDiff, while the current SOTA protein structure design model is RFdiffusion [1]. Also, there is some other protein structure design model like SCMDiff [3], \n\n[3] DIFFUSION PROBABILISTIC MODELING OF PROTEIN BACKBONES IN 3D FOR THE MOTIF-SCAFFOLDING PROBLEM.

Additionally, the author may need to provide an overall graph of the architecture to help reader understand this paper."

                "value": "The general reasoning of why the proposed architecture works better and should be constructed the way it is lies on the concept of atom representation bottleneck. But this bottleneck is not really introduced or investigated in a rigorous manner. Maybe the authors can at least give concrete theoretical counter examples of what problem can be modeled with VFN but not IPA. At least an experimental ablation on varying the virtual node count would be interesting to see how the performance changes.\n\nIt would also be nice if authors could show the theoretical expressivity of their proposed construction. E.g. is there something it cannot model or is it provably universal.\n\nGeneral GNNs have seen some improvements on modeling equivariant structures, e.g. [1, 2, 3] which in some ways have some similarities to the current work (e.g. higher dimensional embedding in frame averaging is a bit like virtual nodes here). It would be nice to see how the proposed VFN architecture stacks up to those general GNN constructions. Although admittedly, those papers usually test their models on molecular and other physics-inspired 3D tasks, but not proteins tackled in this paper. However the extension, especially in case of frame averaging or the multi-channel EGNN, would be trivial. Note that there are also many more improved 3D GNNs, especially in molecule domain that could be applied to this problem. I would like to see the authors test against at least a few of these options, especially frame-averaging as it has been used for proteins a couple of times now [4, 5] and would tackle a similar problems as the proposed model in a very general way.\n\nSpeaking of proteins, in the abstract authors say that only basic encoders such as IPA have been proposed for proteins so far. E.g. [4] applies frame averaging [2] to antibodies, with a quite intersting non-relational architecture for antibody design. While its restricted to a certain protein family it's still worth mentioning that 'less simple' encoders do exist, at least in specific cases.\n \n[1] Du, Weitao, et al. \"A new perspective on building efficient and expressive 3D equivariant graph neural networks.\"\n\n[2] Puny, Omri, et al. \"Frame averaging for invariant and equivariant network design.\" \n\n[3] Levy, Daniel, et al. \"Using Multiple Vector Channels Improves E (n)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks.\"\n\n[4] Martinkus, Karolis, et al. \"Abdiffuser: Full-atom generation of in-vitro functioning antibodies.\"\n\n[5] Jin, Wengong, et al. \"Unsupervised Protein-Ligand Binding Energy Prediction via Neural Euler's Rotation Equation.\""
