                "value": "The paper's approach to addressing the gap between theory and practice in the field is commendable and serves to underscore its originality and significance. It offers a systematic framework that effectively addresses limitations seen in prior research. The paper appropriately points out the various pitfalls present in earlier works, even though they were generally well-regarded (some having high citation counts). To the best of my knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to systematically and explicitly evaluate these pitfalls across not only a toy dataset but also two real-world datasets (LIDC-IDRI and GTA5/Cityscapes). The insights provided by the authors are valuable in confirming that certain theoretical claims, originally validated on toy datasets, may not necessarily translate to at least two real-world datasets. Moreover, it sheds light on what works effectively with ensembles, a commonly used benchmark for uncertainty estimation.\n\nI have to highlight that in this type of works it is always possible to think about more architectures, more datasets and more analysis, but given the limited space (in terms of pages) available, and all the material already in appendices, I believe that the authors chose a good scope for their analysis. In this sense, the quality and clarity of this work is equally very good, given how difficult it is to summarise so many results - Figure 2 (with more details in appendix) thus seemed to me an acceptable and useful way to present such results.\n\nThis work will likely become essential for anyone in the field seeking scientific advancement and a deeper understanding of uncertainty estimations within their specific applications. Hopefully, this paper will prompt the community to pay closer attention to their validation practices. In light of its potential for significant impact in multiple areas, I confidently endorse for its acceptance. I believe it would be fair for this work to have a score of 10, but I prefer to wait for the remaining reviews, during the rebuttal period."

                "value": "It is regrettable that component C0 was fixed (for each dataset) and not explored for at least another architecture. However, I might say that such a weakness is well within the realm of usual limitations expected in a paper.\n\nThe decisions pertaining to component C1 involve numerous hyperparameters, with some known to have a significant impact on performance. Consequently, this represents another weakness in the study, as it appears that these hyperparameters were not thoroughly investigated.\n\nFigure 2 uses different colours to distinguish distinct parts of the figure. This is not friendly for people with colour deficiency, and the authors could try to include patterns on top of the colour scheme."
