Authors propose a two stage aporoach, named SPTNet for GCD. \n- SPTNet iteratively optimizes \"model\" parameters of large self-supervised networks and \"data\" parameters (i.e. prompt tuning methods). The former adapts the model to the data while the latter adapts the data to improve the model's capability of identifying categories. \n- Authors propose a novel Spatial Prompt Tuning (SPT) method that enables the model to focus on object parts an show remarkable improvements across several GCD benchmarks with very few additional trainable parameters."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**Interpretability of SPT**:\n- Authors claim that SPT enables the model to focus on parts of objects, but the way it is designed, there are learnable parameters around each patch. Are the learned parameters, after convergence, sparse in nature? Are there more non-zero values around discriminative regions of objects and zero around patches belonging to background? The SPT setup in its current form is not very interpretable and the experiments certainly do not validate the claim that SPT is better than Bahng et al. because it enables the model to focus on object parts. \nCan this claim be validated/negated if, instead of around a patch, SPT is applied as learnable horizontal or vertical stripes in the image (maintaining the same number of parameters as the original SPTNet). If these experiments achieve the same performance, then the claim made by the authors is not true. I would like to hear the authors' thoughts on this.\n**Ablation experiments**:\n- Table-4 is not presented efficiently in my opinion and needs more attention. From rows 6 and 7, without Global prompting, SPT-S is better than SPT-P. But there is no experiment which uses Global + SPT-S with alternate training in the table. \n- I recommend adding one component at a time to the baseline, makes the table more readable than its current form. I believe most of the experiments are in there and all one would need is to rearrange the rows accordingly. \n- Also the accompanying text to Table-4 has some mistakes which make it harder to read the table. For example. Rows 5,6 compare the effect of alternate training. But in the text, authors explain that these two rows show the benefit of global prompting. Kindly make the table and text consistent and readable to improve reading experience.\n**Alternate training**: \n- In Fig. 3(a), for each k, are epochs adjusted accordingly? I believe this is important because authors report that with smaller k, the model underfits. But what about the experiment of training the model parameters to convergence, followed by training the SPT to convergence (k=1). This experiment is crucial to understand why the alternate training is required. Please provide the details of this experiment. \n**Qualitative results**:\nAuthors show attention maps in Fig. 4b and claim that with SPT, the heads cover the object. I do not see a difference between visualizations of SimGCD and SPTNet to be honest. Instead of showing 4 examples with all the heads, I recommend authors to be more specific and show exactly (by highlighting the region) what they want the readers to focus on. In its current form Fig. 4 does not add anything new to the discussion and can be removed entirely to make space for more important experiments (suggested above)."

                "value": "**Suggestions**:\n- The writing of the paper can be improved. Few sections (ablation, Section 3.2) need improvement. \n- Font of text in Fig.1 font is too small and I recommend increasing that. \n- Difference between SPTNet and SPTNet-P is not clear in the main paper. Readers have to look to supplementary to get clarity. Since this is an important part of the contribution, its better authors move Fig. 5 to the main paper. Also provide an example of computing total number of parameters of SPT in the supplementary. \n\n**Questions**:\n- What happens when you train Bahng et. al's Global prompts by increasing the number of parameters to match SPT? I understand its not a whole lot of parameters but how much would that change the performance of using Global prompts?\n- In the paragraph below **Stage 2: Fix p_{1:n}...**, authors present that they use the spatial prompts as augmentations. But by using learned prompts as augmentation, you are asking the network to be invariant to it, how does this help? The intuition behind using this and why would it improve the performance? How much does it improve the performance of contrastive loss? If that is a significant improvement, then that would be a good result for self-supervised literature.\n\n**Please address all the concerns and questions raised above for me to improve my ratings**"
