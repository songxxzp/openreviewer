This model incorporates Past-Decomposable-Mixing(PDM) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM). As for PDM, it first decomposes time series into seasonal and trend parts. Subsequently, PDM processes seasonal and trend in a fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine manner. After PDM processes input time series, FDM forecasts future observations with multiple predictors. TimeMixer equipped with PDM and FMM shows the best results in various datasets for short-term and long-term forecasting. Furthermore, it proves the efficacy of the decomposition, different-way processing, and multiple predictors."

Good performance with simple models**  \nEmpirically, TimeMixer exhibits remarkably low computational and memory costs because it consists of only simple linear models. However, it's important not to overlook its performance, which should not be underestimated.\n\n**3. Good observations**  \nFrom the thought that fine-scale seasonality can provide coarse-scale one with detailed information while coarse-scale trend can provide fine-scale one with more denoised information, TimeMixer processes trend and seasonality in a different way. The experiment section proves the efficacy of this design and thought. I think that this can broadly affect how to utilize multiple scales in time series.\n\n**4.

                "value": "In spite of the good aspects of this paper, I hesitate to give acceptance because of some minor but important concerns.\n\n**1. Absence of some important baselines**\nBecause this paper is based on decomposition, I think the authors have to include methods based on decompositions [1] into baselines. Furthermore, (although they are not accepted to any conference, ) it is beneficial to include methods based on MLP-Mixer [2,3]. I think that this absence makes the second and fourth strengths fade.\n\n**2. Insufficient experiment in ablation studies**\nI think the biggest contribution of this paper, or the main reason for acceptance, is different-way processing (coarse-to-fine and fine-to-coarse). Although the thought leading to this asymmetric design is not quite intuitive, Table 5 provides empirical results. However, the used datasets are insufficient. Considering its importance, more datasets should be used so this design has to be tested more rigorously. Furthermore, because small $M=1$ is employed for short-term forecasting such as M4, M4 cannot prove the efficacy of the asymmetric design sufficiently. Finally, there isn't an ablation setting where seasonal is coarse-to-fine and the trend is fine-to-coarse. These insufficient ablation studies make the third strength vanish.\n\nIf these main concerns are resolved (include more related baselines and design more strict ablation studies to prove the efficacy of asymmetric design), I will consider raising my points.\n\n\n[1] Shabani et al., Scaleformer: Iterative Multi-scale Refining Transformers for Time Series Forecasting, 2023, ICLR\n[2] Li et al., MTS-Mixers: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Factorized Temporal and Channel Mixing, 2023\n[3] Chen et al., TSMixer: An All-MLP Architecture for Time Series Forecasting, 2023"

However, just summing Figure (b,c,d,e) doesn't result in Figure (a). When I checked your code, not average but the sum was implemented. Can you explain this situation?\n\n3. In table 4, I am confused about the meaning of x mark in pasting mixing and future mixing columns. What does it mean in each column in detail? In other words, how did you implement the method with x mark in each column?"

Specifically, when juxtaposed against competing models, it's not lucidly expounded how TimeMixer excels in capturing temporal variations. A deeper dive into this comparative analysis would have been enlightening. Introducing spectral analysis or similar methodologies might offer theoretical insights that bridge this understanding gap.\n\n2. **Alternative Decomposition Methods**:\n    - The paper seems to sidestep the exploration of alternative decomposition techniques that are prevalent in the domain. For instance, methods such as the Discrete Fourier Transformer (DFT) have been widely recognized in time series analysis. How does the TimeMixer's Past Decomposable Mixing distinguish itself fundamentally from these frequency-based techniques?
