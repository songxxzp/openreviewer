Does this imply that, in an ideal scenario, the denoiser network essentially mirrors the Gaussian distribution introduced to the state initially? If so, what is the purpose of training such a denoiser when we already know the noise model added to the input? How does the denoiser contribute to achieving better rewards and enhanced robustness?\n\nIs a denoiser model used for the continuous (AS-PPO) case? What constitutes the smoothing component in this PPO scenario? What does \\Delta S_t represent in the paragraph following Equation 9?\n\nI am not clear on why this denoiser method helps in achieving a better trade-off between robustness and reward.

Although randomized smoothing offers robustness guarantees, its direct implementation in the DRL context often results in a trade-off between utility and robustness. To overcome this limitation, the authors introduce two innovative algorithms, DS-DQN and AS-PPO, tailored to train DRL agents that achieve high clean rewards and robustness certification in both discrete and continuous action spaces. DS-DQN and AS-PPO surpass previous robust DRL agents and introduce a more potent adversarial attack. Their contributions encompass addressing issues in prior methods, extending robustness guarantees to PPO settings, and introducing action bounds for continuous-action agents."

While the selected baselines do provide a reasonable basis for comparison, it is necessary and valuable to discuss these adversarial robust RL papers (as well as others that are not mentioned) in the related work section. I am concerned that the literature survey of robust RL baselines by the authors might not be comprehensive, especially with regard to recent works. (The authors do cite [1], but why do not discuss ATLA?)\n\n2. Furthermore, I find the presentation of the experiments to be somewhat confusing. In Table 3, why is the comparison limited to SA-PPO and vanilla PPO, and where are Radial-PPO and other PPO-based baselines? It appears that the proposed method performs better only on larger attack budgets. However, in Table 8, it shows that AS-PPO does not have a significant advantage, or even any advantage, on large budgets. \n\n3. In Table 5, the paper fails to clearly demonstrate the advantages of DS-DQN and AS-PPO; the terms \"high\" or \"highest\" are quite vague and do not provide an intuitive representation of contributions.\n\n4. This paper introduces attack methods based on RS.
