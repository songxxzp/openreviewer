By converting protein structural information into graph structures, the model employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to process the structural graph information of proteins. It then integrates the structural representations learned by the GNN with the representations of the ESM-2 model, ultimately resulting in a protein representation that has been enriched with structural information. The paper validates the model's performance on various protein function prediction tasks and compares the impact of different factors such as model size, pre-training strategies, and the amount of structural information on the model's effectiveness."

On the contrary, the introduction of the PST framework is vague. How the node embedding output by GNN is further incorporated into the residue embedding of the original ESM? Did they just add, concentrate? or viewed as the individual token embedding which is conducted with self-attention to the residue embedding of the original ESM? I highly suggest the authors to add more details.\n2. The introduction of structural knowledge of 3D protein structures is limited. This paper just compressed the 3D structures into 2D graphs without considering the 3D geometric features, such as the SE(3)-Equivariant features, which have already been confirmed to be critical in modeling the 3d protein structures or the protein-protein docking patterns by many works, such as Alphafold2, EquiDock, etc. The only considered feature is the distances between nodes severed as the edge attributes while performing less-satisfied on the downstream tasks.\n3. The paper only adopts the subset of AlphaFoldDB. I wonder if the author ever tried other structural databases such as metagenomic protein databases predicted by ESMFold? How do the data quality and quantity affect the performance of PST?\n4. The downstream tasks adopted in this work are limited. As the protein structure information decides the physical and chemical properties of proteins, the downstream tasks should not only be performed on protein structure prediction tasks, but also on other tasks, like protein solubility prediction,  secondary structural prediction, etc. Like xTrimoPGLM (chen et al. ) and Ankh (Elnaggar, et al) do.\n5. Besides the ablation studies claimed in the pre-training strategy, the author should add Seq-only to get rid of the reason solely brought by the sequence-based training.\n6. \"While PST typically surpasses its base ESM-2 counterpart at similar model sizes, this performance gain tapers off with increasing model size. \"Does this observation indicate that if we adopt a huge amount of protein sequence data and also the large scale of PLMs,   the structural knowledge can be well-captured on the sequence-based pertaining, like xTrimoPGLM with 100B dominates on most of the downstream tasks?\n7. From the Table.1, although the PST with fixed representation outperforms the GearNet MVC, the end-to-end PST(fintuned) lies behind the GearNet MVC on the fold classification tasks. How to explain this?\n\n\n\nGanea, et al. \"Independent se (3)-equivariant models for end-to-end rigid protein docking.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.07786 (2021).\n\nChen, et al. \"xTrimoPGLM: unified 100B-scale pre-trained transformer for deciphering the language of protein.\" bioRxiv (2023): 2023-07.\n\nElnaggar, et al. \"Ankh\u2625: Optimized protein language model unlocks general-purpose modeling.\" bioRxiv (2023): 2023-01."
