The performance improvement on ANES and Diabetes ReadMission is relatively weak in the Supervised setting (which is the setting with the overall best performance). This makes the proposed method weak.\n3. The hyper-parameter of the proposed method lacks thoughtful discussion. For example, the alpha in the label distribution handler determines how quickly the model can adapt to the latest label distribution, which may seriously affect the performance.\n4. This method calibrates the logits with sample-wise temperature and estimated label distribution, which can only handle the label distribution shift problems rather than covariate shift problems.\n5.
