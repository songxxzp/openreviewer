It reveals a counter-intuitive phenomenon - representations of cumulative gradients exhibit some independence from the initial point from which they are calculated. This means that the learned gradients can be assigned to other arbitrarily initialized networks while maintaining a similar representation to the original network. Model fusion can also transfer learned representations across models by assigning the weights of one network to another network. When learning sequential tasks, both gradient assignment and model fusion can mitigate catastrophic forgetting to a certain extent. Extensive experiments on convolutional networks and ResNet demonstrate that this phenomenon occurs. This challenges traditional non-convex optimization theory of neural networks and provides new insights into their \"black box\" nature. In summary, the main contribution of this article is to reveal an interesting counterintuitive phenomenon, provide theory and experiments to analyze it, demonstrate its potential to improve deep learning techniques and provide new insights into understanding and improving neural network optimization."

                "value": "While this paper presents an intriguing phenomenon, a few aspects could be improved to enhance the completeness and clarity of the work.\n\nFirstly, some additional details on the experimental methodology would further strengthen reproducibility. Specifically, providing the full specifications for initialization schemes, optimization techniques, and learning rates utilized would allow readers to better comprehend the empirical results. Furthermore, incorporating key theoretical derivations directly into the main text, rather than relegating them to the appendix, would improve readability. Overall, reorganizing portions of the paper could enhance the flow and explanations for the reader, like explaining the phenomenon before presenting formulations.\n\nSecondly, expanding the experimental evaluations to encompass more diverse datasets and network architectures would better demonstrate the generalizability of the phenomenon. The current experiments focus heavily on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 with simple convolutional and residual networks. Evaluating the effects across more tasks and models could further substantiate the claims.\n\nFinally, deriving more rigorous theoretical analyses to elucidate the underlying reasons for the surprising phenomenon of gradient independence could elevate the contributions. Supplementing the empirical results with detailed proofs grounded in optimization theory would provide greater justification for the counter-intuitive findings.\n\nIn summary, this paper uncovers an intriguing phenomenon but could benefit from refinements to the presentation, expanded experimental validations, and strengthened theoretical explanations. Addressing these aspects would help realize the full potential and impact of this promising work. With revision, the study has the opportunity to make significant contributions to demystifying deep neural network optimization."

Although the authors state that they performed extensive simulations, I would say that they are instead pretty limited.

This is not enough for a paper which contains no theory predicting the phenomenon (e.g. I would expect runs both on MLPs, on convnets with varying architectural details, and on large-scale models).

                "value": "Presentation.\n- The first page is boilerplate text which could apply to any paper, and does not add anything.\n- The rest of the introduction feels vague and not to the point. There are several references here and there, but they do not help the readability of the paper, and it is not easy to follow the narrative.\n- There is no mention to catastrophic forgetting in the intro (beyond the bullet point where the authors state they study it) nor in the related work section.\n- The argued invariance is about cumulative gradients, but cumulative gradients are never explicitly defined, so essentially we don't know what we're talking about. \nOne guess would be that this is about gradient accumulation, but in this case all the accumulated gradients are used as a single gradient (i.e. it's just a way to circumvent memory problems). Eqs.4 and 5 hint at a definition, but they use a compact notation which is not self-explanatory and is not explained in detail by defining the objects or making the dependencies explicit. The way the equations are written, it would seem that the cumulative gradients are just the full-batch gradients calculated at step 1, but then the authors would just have said that, or have written that the theory is for GD instead of SGD (and also, it would not be clear what is done at the following steps). If instead we are not talking of full-batch gradients, it could be that we are talking of several gradients calculated at different times, but then there should be a dependence on time on the loss function and on the gradients. So essentially I am not sure about what the found symmetry consists of, and I do not want to be guessing.\nMy first suggestion would be to explicitly include time in the equation, and try to make it very clear what the preocedure consists of.\n \n - The procedure of assigning the waits from a differently initialized model is not clear. For example, are the models trained in parallel and the gradients assigned to the other model? Also, I would have appreciated attempts at really understanding the process. For example, what happens if I permutate the labels in the original model?\n \n - It is also not clear what is done when the authors say that weights from a model trained on another dataset are taken. What does it mean that the authors took a \"well-trained\" model from another dataset? How are the gradients transferred? At every time step? Is the procedure invariant under label permutation and weight permutation? Since the other datasets are taken, that have a different number of classes, also the numer of weights are different, so how are the weights in the last layer transferred.\n \n - It is not clear how models were trained, whether and how hyperparameter tuning was done, for how many epochs the models were trained and whether this was enough for convergence, what the loss functions and the optimizers were, and so on. These are important questions, both because of reproducibility, and because these elements could have an impact on whether the claimed phenomena are present. \n   \n \n- It is not clearly presented that the performances are training performances, and other times it is ultimately not clear. For example, table 1 mentions that the accuracy of the original model ($\\theta_A$) is accuracy=1 (so I would guess we're talking about training accuracy), while table 2 says that the test accuracy of the original model is 0.61. \n- The language looks sometimes inadequate. For example, \"we employed the original convolutional network as our network architecture\", or talking of \"The conclusions in Equation equation 4 have been supported by numerous empirical results Nguyen & Hein (2017); Li et al. (2018)\". Eq.4 does not have any conclusions, and it is not clear what the two references are cited for.\n\n- the figures would be clearer if it was always explicit on the label whether training or test loss is depicted, and if the xlabels (alpha) were explicitly written.\n\n- It should be specified on the captions what the numbers in tables 5 and 6 are (accuracies). Also, I suggest that all accuracies be written with the same notation (in previous tables they are written as numbers between 0 and 1, and now between 0 and 100).\n\n\nCode. \n- The code is not made available. This is especially a problem because I was not able to check and understand what the procedures consisted of."

I think it distracts, and is potentially misleading, since the more or less high training performances \n\n- Why is the test accuracy in Fig.3 higher than the training accuracy, even though no data augmentation was used?\n\n- In Eq.7, wouldn't it be more intuitive to write it as a linear interpolation between the two models [$\\theta_n(1-\\alpha)+\\alpha\\theta_A$]?\n\n- From section 3 (and from intuition) we know that if we use the original model ($\\theta_A$) we have better performance than if we transfer the gradients.

As this work only investigates shallow networks there may not be enough layers for this to worsen the model's outputs at values of $\\alpha$ near 1.

For example, [\nModel Fusion via Optimal Transport (Singh \\& Jaggi, 2020)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/fb2697869f56484404c8ceee2985b01d-Abstract.html) fuses larger models while preserving more accuracy when moving between disjoint datasets.\n\nThe experiments could be fleshed out more (see questions), and some of the presentation could also be improved:\n- the introduction and related work section are overly broad and the paper does not make clear how some of the cited works are related, such as the work related to information compression (Tishby et al.).\n- the interesting results in appendix B could be shown in the main text instead."

                "value": "1. What are the baseline performances of the trained networks, such as $\\theta_A$ without adding gradients/fusion, as well as performance of at different scales, i.e. $\\alpha \\theta_A$?\n2. What are the results for both residual and non-residual networks in all of the experiments? Some larger networks (e.g. VGG-16, ResNet-18, etc.) could also be shown.\n3. Does the linear combination of $\\alpha \\theta_A + \\beta \\theta_B$ preserve performance on task $B$ as well as task $A$? In general, if combining two networks which are both trained, it would be instructive to know how the performance on both tasks varies with $\\alpha$.\n4. Given that this work investigates the performance of networks along linear paths, how does this work relate to the literature investigating the linear (mode) connectivity of networks?\n5. What are some other implications or applications of this work?"
