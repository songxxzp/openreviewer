The aim of inversion is to recover the original image as faithfully as possible in the reverse process from the noisy latents obtained in the forward process of the diffusion model. Authors build on an existing technique that rely on solving an optimization problem for each time step in the reverse process, and propose a modification that does away with the costly optimization. The resulting fast inversion technique can be used with diffusion-based editing framework to perform purely text-based image editing."

How is the approximation impacted by the number of steps? \n\n- If we approximate the optimized null-text embedding with C, it means that the same solution could have been found by null-text inversion, especially with shared embedding across time steps. How does null-text inversion compare with shared embeddings? Can we improve upon simply plugging in C by performing *some* optimization around C (not necessarily in every time step to reduce cost)?\n\n- The experiments would be better presented in a way that compares inversion/editing performance *given a fixed time budget* in order to highlight the efficiency of the algorithm.\n\n- I don't quite understand why the method is called negative-prompt inversion. Negative prompting commonly refers to a description of features in an image we do not want to generate in the context of text-conditioned diffusion models."

Experiments demonstrate that the proposed negative-prompt inversion obtains comparable reconstruction quality as existing methods and is more than 30 times faster than null-text inversion.

The primary motivation behind this work is to achieve high-quality image reconstruction while reducing the computational cost and processing time involved.\n\nThe paper builds upon null-text inversion, a technique that leverages the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) inversion and Classifier Free Guidance (CFG). Null-text inversion optimizes the embedding vector of an empty string to align the diffusion process calculated by DDIM inversion with the reverse diffusion process calculated using CFG. Negative Prompt Inversion is based on the observation that using the origin (resp. target) prompt instead of optimizing the null prompt brings comparable results in reconstruction (resp. edition). This simple modification offers a substantial improvement in processing speed."

This comparison would help assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method in the context of image editing. Moreover, the proposed work as well as the Null-text inversion are also very close to the prompt tuning inversion paper and could also be compared to it. \n\n- **Mixed performances** The paper mentions that the image editing performances of Negative Prompt Inversion are below DDIM with CFG. This observation raises questions about the practical utility of the proposed method. \n\n- **Lack of justification** The paper does not sufficiently justify the underlying hypotheses and assumptions of the Negative Prompt Inversion method in the main paper. Specifically, the paper relies on two strong hypotheses regarding the equivalence of null-text inversion features and initial DDIM trajectories, as well as the equality of predicted noise at adjacent denoising steps. These hypotheses are not adequately explained or justified in the main paper and are relegated to the supplementary material. Providing a more robust rationale for these assumptions would enhance the paper's credibility and comprehensibility. Furthermore,  Proposition 3 in the supplementary is supposed to justify the second hypothesis in the general case, but it lacks clarity. In particular, the implication that $\\alpha_t \\simeq \\alpha_{t-1} \\Rightarrow z_t^{\\ast} \\simeq z_{t-1}^{\\ast}$ should be clarified and expanded."

In the latter case, editing results with DDIM + CFG could be provided here. \n\n- Most of the justifications in the supplementary material (sec. A.1)  are provided for the case where the noise component is conditioned on the clean sample $z_0$. In this case, the conclusion holds $\\bar{z}_t = z^*_t$. However, as stated later, the denoising model does not have $z_0$ as input. If it does not support the justification in the actual process of DDIM sampling, I wonder how useful are Prop. 1 and all the discussion from eq. (7) to (23)?"
