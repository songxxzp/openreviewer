This suggests that a different model needs to be trained on each network topology and also that a model trained on one topology cannot generalize to other topologies. This renders the proposed approach impractical for several applications.\n\n- Another weakness of the work (which is also discussed in section 6) is that the number of parameters of the proposed model depends on the number of edges of the graph. In case of network topologies that consist of a very large number of edges, this can lead to very large models which are hard to train and might suffer from poor generalization if not many training samples are available.\n\n- It is not clear whether the comparison against the baselines is fair. Are all models evaluated under the same parameter budget? Based on the values shown in Table 2, I would guess that the answer is no. Furthermore, in the case of GCN and GraphSAGE which do not support edge features, the edge capacities are aggregated and used as node features. This is very likely to have a negative impact on those models' performance. I would suggest the authors replace those two models with other architectures that can handle edge features.\n\n- The paper focuses only on a single property of routing strategies (MLU). It is not thus clear whether the proposed method provides performance improvements in tasks where other properties need to be predicted.\n\n- There are some related works which also use graph neural networks to predict the values of other performance indicators that are not discussed in the paper (see for instance [1] and [2]).\n\n[1] Rusek, K., Su\u00e1rez-Varela, J., Almasan, P., Barlet-Ros, P., & Cabellos-Aparicio, A.

It is unclear to me how can PEW handle graphs with varying sizes and structures. Do we have to train a respective PEW-GNN for diverse real-world graph topologies? Is there a solid reason for just overfitting a specific topology?\n\n- Variance to node permutation. One importance feature a GNN should possess is invariance to node permutation. It is unclear to me if PEW have such a feature, or if PEW doesn\u2019t need this feature.\n\n- Unclear generalizability. PEW seems to be based on some strong assumptions (\u201cnode identities are known\u201d) and specifically designed for one problem. What other tasks do you anticipate PEW can excel at?\n\n- Unclear scalability. The handled graphs have only dozens of nodes. PEW wouldn't lead to an unreasonable number of parameters for such graph scales. However, is this a reasonable scale for real-world applications?\n\n\nRegarding experimentation:\n\n- Potentially unreasonable baselines. Prior works related to \"ML for routing flows in computer networks\" are summarized in the \"Related Work\" section. However, both discussions of and comparisons against these works are absent. Instead, the authors compare PEW to some widely applicable standard GNNs, which is not convincing enough for me.\n\n- Absence of comparisons with non-learning baselines. Are there any non-learning baselines for this task? If so, comparing PEW against them would be more convincing.\n\n- Insufficient validation of motivation. How are the ground truth labels generated? What are the advantages of learning-based prediction over the way the ground truth is generated? Are they verified in the experiments?"

This method builds upon across-relation graph attention networks. The proposed methodology is experimentally assessed on 17 real provided topologies and 2 routing schemes (SSP and ECMP).

This potentially makes this work relevant to a wider audience, e.g., the communication networks community.\n2. The main observation behind PEW is meaningful. One expects that edges cannot play the same role in the underlying flow network, so that we cannot uniformly aggregate the messages received along each edge. The fact that the proposed methodology uses a different message function per edge thus makes sense in such a context.\n3. The paper uses real network topologies, which makes the results more reliable. The traffic matrices are synthetic but use the gravity model, which is considered quite realistic in the traffic engineering literature.\n4. The results for MSE indeed show that PEW is indeed able to outperform other graph approaches as well as MLP. This is aligned with the authors' claim that the PEW trick can improve performance in flow networks."

                "value": "1. The ML/AI contribution seems to be rather limited. Using a different message function per edge as opposed to identical message functions across all edges is meaningful in the context of flow networks, but the novelty is rather low otherwise. The PEW architecture is a variation of the across-relation variant of relational GATS, so the proposed architecture cannot be viewed as a novel contribution of this work.\n\n2. I am not exactly clear what the motivation behind this paper is. The authors describe the challenge that \"a priori knowledge of the full demand matrix is an unrealistic assumption, but ML techniques can address this by learning a model trained on past load that can perform well in a variety of traffic scenarios\". However, the real network topologies used in this work are rather small. In that case, it is not clear whether an ML model can provide a substantial benefit. Perhaps one could simply run linear programming algorithms to compute the MLU for a new traffic matrix (if demand changes) or for the new topology (if the network topology suddenly changes)? \n\n3. Continuing point (2), if the authors state that the proposed PEW is the correct architecture for network flow problems, then it would be easier to make such a point if PEW showed potential for devising alternative routing strategies. Currently, the authors have simply used the new architecture with a regression task, i.e., that of computing the MLU. If PEW is the right architecture for general flow problems, then it should show the same potential with other tasks (e.g., classification tasks, or the harder task of learning a policy, for instance via RL). The current setting is too specific and in my view it is not sufficient to show the full potential of PEW.\n\n4. One shortcoming of PEW is that it cannot generalize to new, previously unseen topologies, since the message functions depend on the edge. This can make it cumbersome to use this framework in practice, because one needs to train a separate model for each network topology using lots of different data points. Architectures that would be easily adapted to new networks (e.g., with similar number of nodes/edges but very different topology) would be very helpful.\n\n5. The authors experimented with rather small networks, up to 82 nodes. It might have been useful to consider even larger networks, since small networks may be easier to handle with traditional algorithms. Furthermore, it may have made sense to experiment with synthetic topologies as well, e.g., with networks generated with the BA model, the ER model, or the WS model (all are available in the NetworkX graph analysis package). Strong results on a variety of synthetic topologies (possibly with more nodes) would further strengthen the current claims in the paper. That said, the proposed method may not be easily scalable to large graphs due to having many more learnable parameters (especially, as the number of edges increases).\n\n6. I am not sure I understood Table 1. As mentioned in point (2) above, the authors seem to claim that a motivation of this work is to learn a graph model with high predictive performance under changing topology or demands. To show this claim, the authors would have included the MSE on the varied graph structure. Ideally, we would want the MSE to remain low for a high predictive performance. Instead, the authors mention the WR and the MRR, which is only a relative measure which does not properly reflect the absolute predictive performance. Similarly, in Figure 4 the authors only show how PEW performs with raw demands and GAT with sum demands, but they do not show how PEW performs with sum demands or GAT with raw demands.\n\n7. I am not sure it makes sense to use a fixed number of demand matrices for all topologies. Large topologies would naturally need more training points than small topologies. Normally, we use a dataset that is adequate for learning purposes. The fact that the authors used a fixed number of demand matrices everywhere may be distorting the results, especially for larger graphs."

Have the authors tried to experiment with larger networks? what about synthetic networks?\n4. Could the authors provide clarifications on Table1 and Figure 4? For Table 1, in particular, does the MSE remain low when we apply the learned model to the changed demand matrix or the changed topology?\n5. Why did the authors use a fixed number of demand matrices?\n6. Can the learned models generalize to new topologies?
