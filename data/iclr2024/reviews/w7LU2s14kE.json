                "value": "It is well known that language models acquire knowledge of subjects, objects and their relations. However, to date, it is not well understood how these relations are represented in the model. The paper posits that relations are implemented as Linear Relational Embeddings, that is, affine transformations mapping from the embedding of the subject to the embedding of the object. The paper proposes to compute these mappings from the Jacobian $\\delta o / \\delta s$, where o and s are object and subject embeddings at certain layers, respectively.\nThe paper validates this approach by measuring a) faithfulness, i.e., whether decoding from the LRE mapping matches decoding from the true model when given a prompt expressing the relation, and b) to what extend this mapping is a causal explanation by providing an inverse of the LRE capable to change s such that a different, desired o results.\nThe experiments show that the method results in relatively high, but far from perfect, faithfulness and causality scores. The method is compared to number of reasonable baselines/ablations. Finally, the method is applied to the use case of detecting when the language model outputs false relationships despite knowing the true relationship."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* Limitations are not discussed in enough detail. For example, given a fixed subject and relation, it is possible that there are multiple true objects. This has consequences both for the generation of the datasets (where examples are filtered out if they're not generated by the model) and questions to what extend an invertible function can be a reasonable approximation of the true function, since invertibility implies that the function/relation is injective. Discussing these aspects would improve the paper.\n\nI am a bit skeptical with regards to some results:\n* Table 4 (Appendix A) shows the number of correctly predicted relations per language model. It is quite remarkable that some models in some categories get zero percent of the facts right, whereas other models get a much larger percentage right. Zero percent hints at systematic errors that remain undiscussed in the paper. For example, the LLaMA-13B achieves zero percent on the task of predicting president's birth year and election year. This is quite curious, given that these are quite well-known facts that appear a lot in the pretraining data, and the other models get them right. There is a reason for the poor performance of LLaMA on this particular task: Their tokenizer represents every digit as its own token. However, the caption of Table 4 states that only the first token was used to determine correctness. Since the LLaMa model would require 4 tokens, it had no chance of predicting the \"correct\" token. IMO, this is shortcoming of the proposed measurement, and accepting this bias should at least be discussed. I suspect that similar reasons might cause zero percent accuracy on some of the other tasks.\n* Table 4 (Appendix A) shows that GPT-J gets zero examples from the \"occupation gender\" category right. Hence, none of these examples from this category should remain in the dataset for GPT-J according to the description in Section 4 (Dataset). Curiously, Figure 3 shows that \"occupation gender\" has a near 100% faithfulness success rate. How can that be if there are no such examples?"

With experiments on 47 different relations, the authors find that for some relations the linear approximation hold. However, this linear attribute is not universal.
