This paper offers certain reference value for this field.\n- The writing of the paper is enjoyable, featuring a clear method description, and the experiment is easy to follow as well.\n- Technically, the paper presents several innovations. For example, this paper combines natural language generation and formalized language verification, using theorem provers to verify whether the generated natural language reasoning steps are valid.\n- The experimental data in this paper effectively demonstrate the value of the data generated by this framework. The evaluation section analyzes two models, multiple fine-tuning strategies, and training data, showcasing rich results."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper has some limitations:\n- The improvement of involving the theorem prover is relatively minor (e.g., see $\\texttt{in}$, $\\texttt{ra}$, and $\\texttt{va}$ in Table 4), and it raises the question of whether the best result should be derived from direct fine-tuning without any filtering and sampling.\n- The subset sampled for manual verification is small (only 88 data points). Given the variance in the dataset due to the different performance of the theorem prover on various types of math problems, the results on such a small dataset may not accurately represent the statistical characteristics of the whole dataset.\n\nAdditionally, there are some minor issues in the paper:\n- It is unclear to me which model is used for generating the MUSTARD dataset. It would be helpful if the authors provided the performance of the LLM used for data generation as a reference.\n- The scalability of the framework is still unknown. Only 7,335 data points are generated, which is a small token size for LLM fine-tuning, and the results after fine-tuning are mediocre. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this framework for larger LLM models (e.g., 34B or 70B models or GPT3 models) remains to be investigated.\n- Since both natural language problem-solving and autoformalization are generated by LLM, and only ATP is used to verify the entire scheme, it is unclear how the authors handle inconsistencies between the final result calculated by the #reduce statement (as shown in Figure 2) and the natural language. The filtering strategy in Table 13 does not cover this situation (as ATP will not report an error).\n- There seems to be a significant misalignment between the generated 7,335 data points and the test set. For instance, the paper showcases a problem about the convergence of alternating series, which is within the scope of undergraduate mathematics, while the test set GSM8k only covers elementary school-level problems. Additionally, the paper mentions using the #reduce statement in Lean, which is an approach for math word problems but is not consistent with the style of various theorem proofs in Mathlib."
