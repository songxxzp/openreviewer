                "value": "The paper provides a comprehensive and extremely insightful investigation about the point aggregation module -- the core in point cloud architecture where, given a target point, how we aggregate information from other source points. \n\nThis paper fills a blank of this point convolution area -- i.e.Which type of point aggregation is the best? From my viewpoint, most existing works on point cloud architecture like PointNet++ PointConv and KPConv are trying to improve this convolution module in terms of different subtle details like neighborhood querying, kernel function etc. Even the recent point transformer falls in this scope by replacing conv-based aggregation with attention-based way under a mild assumption that the feature of target point is known whereas the point conv doesn\u2019t require it.  Although those works gradually improve the performance on the common benchmark, comprehensive study is still missing -- in other words, different modules are not compared in a controlled setting -- and leads to the best design choice unknown. Because of this, I\u2019ve been bothered so many times by having no idea about which modules are better. So from my perspective, this paper fixes this problem in this area and I believe it can inspire future works like mine. \n\nThe derived suggestions are very useful. It includes: no ReLU in MLP, ball-query better KNN and kernel point is better than MLP. For the latter two, I think it\u2019s not surprising as I also observe this. But it\u2019s still useful to have a fair comparison to show it. And for the first one, it\u2019s something new to me. \n\nAlso, from my viewpoint,  the formula presented by the author is easy to follow. I would consider using the same formula -- it summarizes the most of existing convolution in a unified way-- when I teach a lecture about point convolution next time."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper has several weaknesses which I\u2019ll detail below. \n\nMore modules could be considered -- for example like the very powerful PAConv that defines the convex kernel function. Also the recent PointMLP [1] defines an interesting local aggregation module that relies on normalization. I think the author can further improve the paper by including more options. \n\nThe paper utilizes the KPConv with fixed kernel point location which is suboptimal in original KPConv paper. So I would recommend discussing how the deformable KPConv fits in the formula. This would make the paper more comprehensive. \n\nI\u2019m not very sure if I can agree with the argument made in Eq. 1 where the Point transformer is not a convolution. From my perspective,  it also has a similar formula if we consider the query point\u2019s features. But this is my personal viewpoint. I wouldn\u2019t convince authors to convey point transformers in a convolution way. However, given that the author doesn\u2019t consider the point transformer as a kind of convolution, it\u2019s a bit weird to validate the proposed tips derived from convolution into the point transformer. So I think the author might want to clarify it a bit in the paper. \n\nThe paper didn\u2019t use the ModelNet40. Although it\u2019s a synthetic dataset that is highly saturated by lots of existing methods, I believe that it\u2019s still a proper dataset to fairly investigate the different subtle modules in point convolution. Or the paper needs to justify why the paper doesn\u2019t use the popular ModelNet40 in my opinion. \n\n[1]Ma, Xu, et al. \"Rethinking network design and local geometry in point cloud: A simple residual MLP framework.\"  ICLR 22."
