For example, the discussion of the Langevin dynamics in 2.3 would strongly benefit from having the corresponding equation clearly written for definiteness, especially because several conventions exist, and also for the sake of readability.\n- While I admit some technical details are essential in the understanding of the result and the flow of the paper,  this is not the case of all of them (e.g. the discussion at the beginning of 3.1.1 could be shortened). \n- As a consequence, the assumptions on the scaling of $d,n,N$ are also dispersed through the text, making it difficult to follow which assumptions are needed in the end for the results to hold."

Does it refer to the ansatz (12)? Since the target only depends on $H_{1,3}$, I do not understand why the model would depend on higher order Hermites, nor why this would be a sign of feature learning. Could you elaborate?\n\n- Am I right to understand the theory quantitatively predicts the experiments only in the GFL phase, and only holds qualitatively in terms of phenomenology to explain the transition to GMFL-I and II phases?\n\n- (Minor) In Fig. 2, solid lines correspond to the theory? It should be explicitly stated for better readability.\n\n- (Minor)  It would be more compelling to complement Fig. 3 with experimental simulations, similarly to Fig.1 middle and right."

                "value": "This paper studies phase transitions in a model of deep neural networks. The authors focus on two distinct tasks: polynomial regression and modular arithmetic. Using an approach to study large width neural networks trained to equilibrium with Langevin dynamics, they derive an action that defines the Bayesian posterior distribution of read-in weight vectors given the training data. The authors show a competition of the Gaussian weight prior proportional to $\\log p(w) \\propto - \\frac{1}{2} |w|^2$ and a data dependent likelihood term which arises from integration of the readout layer. Because of the competition of these terms, the action can transition from having one saddle point at $w=0$ (giving the lazy NNGP kernel + small feature learning corrections) to having multiple saddle points which all contribute to the final predictor. Beyond a certain point, the outlier overlap values dominate the action and the $w=0$ saddle point no longer contributes. These define the 3 phases of what the authors refer to as Grokking transitions and the three phases are Gaussian Feature Learning (GFL), then Gaussian Mixture Feature Learning GMFL-I and GMFL-II.  For tasks with a target function that is controlled by a single direction $w^*$ , they show that the overlap $w \\cdot w^*$ has a distribution which becomes multimodal and that this can be made dramatic by scaling up the likelihood term. The authors argue that this phenomenon can lead to sudden changes in the learned representations and generalization error in neural networks as a function of $\\sigma^2$ , dataset size $n$ or model width $N$ since all three of these quantities appear in the likelihood term, in analogy to first order phase transitions."

I do not see this as a fundamental limitation of the paper (which I quite appreciate) but mainly as an issue of framing. In my opinion this work is a more fundamental phenomenon than grokking since it pertains to fundamental questions in deep learning such as how width, data and parameterization affect feature learning. The paper is not completely rigorous and relies on various approximations, but I think that is completely fine since it supports its claims with experiments and computations at a physics level of rigor. It also relies on some prior work from Seroussi et al 2022 and a short summary of this approach in the Appendix could be helpful. Lastly, some of the exposition is a bit challenging to follow (see questions below). \n\nThat said, if these issues/questions are addressed I would be happy to raise my score."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. I am a bit confused about the scaling limits. What is the exact order of limits taken? Is width $N$ and data $n$ scaled together in some way? Is the kernel $Q$ always full rank? What about the scaling of $\\sigma^2$ with various quantities? In the Appendix, this is discussed in a high level ($n$ large first, then $d$), but the resulting action still contains factors of $N, d, \\sigma^2$ , etc rather than $O(1)$ quantities, which makes it a bit difficult to interpret. Is it thought that the $n$, $d$ limit commute? I suspect not, as the authors discuss various joint scalings like $n \\sim d^3$ or $n \\sim d^{1.5}$ etc in Appendix. Which (if any) of these are actually adopted when deriving the action? \n2. In the Appendix A.1 the authors describe how they adopt a mean field parameterization, yet the resulting action\u2019s likelihood term vanishes as $N \\to \\infty$. Is it clear why finite width networks would have less feature learning in the mean field parameterization? I was under the impression that this should be constant with $N$. \n2. Could one study mean squared error so that the likelihood term was intensive in dataset size corresponding to a loss $\\mathcal L = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{\\mu=1}^n \\ell(x_\\mu, y_\\mu)$ and parameter distirbution $p(\\theta) \\propto \\exp\\left(  - \\beta \\mathcal L - \\frac{1}{2} |\\theta|^2 \\right)$? If this choice was made does the dataset size still control the phase transition? The reason I ask is because this would correspond to Langevin dynamics on a reasonably scaled and regularized cost function $\\mathcal L + \\frac{1}{2\\beta} |\\theta|^2$ with added Brownian motion with variance $\\frac{2}{\\beta}$, which at large $\\beta$ is closer to how networks are trained in practice ( mean loss, rather than extensive sum over data points). I am wondering if many of the factors of $n$ which appear in the computation are in fact artifacts of the comparison of the raw scale of the likelihood to the prior.\n4. I understand that the density of $w$ undergoes transitions as the number of critical points in the action changes, requiring use of multiple saddle points when computing observable averages. Why must a saddle point approximation over the density of weights $w$ be taken? One could also imagine computing observable averages by sampling this non-Gaussian density as in works on mean field neural networks like Mei et al 2019 or Bordelon & Pehlevan 2022? Is there something lost by approximating each ``well\u201d around a minimum of the action $S(w)$ with a quadratic? Is this the approach taken by the authors when they predict macroscopic quantities like scale of cubic component in the predictor? Could the authors comment on these different approaches?\n5. Could there be a connection between the phase transition reported here and the transition in https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02157 Figure 5c where as the feature learning strength $\\gamma_0$ increases, the training dynamics transition from having a convergent perturbation series in $\\gamma_0^2$ to a non-perturbative regime where the power series diverges?"

Otherwise, the reader might have to keep moving between pages.\n- I think the paper could have a broader reach if improved intuition is provided (e.g., explaining how the terms in the action stem from the loss, regularization, and added noise more explicitly)."

Two settings are studied: a student erf-network learning a single index teacher; and a two-layer net with quadratic activation learning modular addition.\n\nThis paper doesn't introduce the background knowledge and related work at all, making it a very hard task to understand what they are exactly doing."

                "value": "* This paper is poorly written. It claims that it is using an \"adaptive kernel approach\" to explain grokking, but they never explains what this method is. I tried to read the previous works, but they are not easy to read for ML audience, either. I urge the authors to introduce the background better: What is the \"adaptive kernel\"? Why is it important to study \"action\"? Why does the approximation in the paragraph beginning with \"Next,\" in Page 4 make sense? What is the theory of phase transition in physics? How are phase transitions connected to bifurcation and saddle point equations? The current version of the paper contains too many unexplained jargons. Even if I could have spent hours reading previous works to understand the background better, I don't believe the current version of the paper is ready for ML audience to read.\n* If this paper focuses on theory, then it is better to organize the claims into theorems and lemmas. In the current version, there are no theorems and lemmas at all. Everything seems to be stated in a very informal way, making it very hard to check the correctness.\n* In my current understanding, the whole \"adaptive kernel approach\" builds on top of the Langevin dynamics, where isotropic noise is injected into the weights. If there is no noise or the noise is not isotropic, then the theory in this paper may not hold anymore. However, in the paper that proposes grokking (Power et al., 2022), the noise should be from the random sampling of batches and thus can hardly be isotropic, but the grokking phenomenon can still be observed. The adaptive kernel theory in this paper cannot cover this case at all."
