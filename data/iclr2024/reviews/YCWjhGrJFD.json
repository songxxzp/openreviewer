Compared with DPOK, the modification of policy optimization is somewhat incremental. In the related work, the authors claims that training on many prompts is one of two key advantages over DPOK. But, DPOK also can train with multiple prompts and provides quantitative results for that experiment. It is better to conduct this experiment with the same setting to support this point. Besides, the authors only show that the proposed method outperforms simple RWR methods. It is essential to compare with previous works. For example, show different methods\u2019 ability to handle prompts involving color, composition, counting and location. \n-  As shown in Appendix B, there is a subtle bug in the implementation. This bug maybe affect the quantitative comparisons and lower the support for the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is one of my major concerns about this paper. \n- In the experiment related to aesthetic quality, the finetuned model produce images with fixed style, as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 6.

The authors implement DDPO via policy gradient (i.e., REINFORCE) or together with importance sampling (i.e., PPO-like approach).

It seems like DDPO improves prompt fidelity at the expense of sample diversity, so I wonder if there is a way to control the amount of reward during generation. \n- It seems like the reward function for different tasks have different ranges, and thus DDPO uses running mean and variance for normalization. I guess the difficulty of solving MDP varies across different prompts. Could the author elaborate on the optimization analysis with respect to the difficulty of prompts? \n- In implementation, the author chooses T=50 throughout experiments. What if the timesteps become smaller or larger? Definitely the denser timestep sampling would require more cost, but I believe it can reduce the variance of gradient.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) In terms of image generation quality, the paper lacks a quantitative and qualitative comparison with recent works. It fails to provide experimental support for its effectiveness. Specifically, in the absence of comparisons in image quality with all methods related to \"Optimizing diffusion models using policy gradients,\" it is challenging to discern the improvements this paper offers over baseline approaches. This makes it difficult to evaluate the paper's contribution to the community.\n\n2) Regarding originality and community contribution, compared to DPOK and \"Optimizing ddpm sampling with shortcut fine-tuning,\" I did not observe significant differences between this paper and DPOK from the introduction to the Method section. The structural similarity in writing is quite evident. The most noticeable difference is the introduction of importance sampling in method 4.3. However, this alone does not sufficiently support the paper\u2019s claims of innovation, especially without experimental evidence backing its effectiveness (if such evidence exists, please inform me during the Rebuttal phase). The second noticeable difference is the automated generation of rewards using BLIP, which is already a standard engineering practice and has been claimed by RLAIF. I do not believe the methodological contributions and community impact of this paper meet the acceptance standards of the ICLR conference.\n\n3) The experimental evaluation criteria are unreasonable. Most pretrained reward evaluation models are not designed for robust data manifold, especially for treating it as a \"fine-tuning teacher.\" Consequently, out-of-domain evaluation is necessarily needed. For example, the authors use Aesthetic Quality as a reward function to fine-tune the Diffusion model and employ the same Aesthetic Quality for scoring during evaluation. This approach does not allow for assessing whether an improvement in the Aesthetic Quality Score correlates with an enhancement in image generation quality. A more reasonable evaluation, as exemplified by DPOK, would involve fine-tuning with one Reward model and then evaluating it against both this model and a new, out-of-domain Reward model. DPOK's evaluating approach might provide a more substantial basis for assessment.\n\n4) Lack of code. The lack of open-source code, compounded by the absence of comparisons with recent works, makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the approach."
