                "value": "This paper presents a theoretical analysis of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a technique for efficiently fine-tuning pre-trained models, including large language and diffusion models. It establishes that LoRA can effectively adapt a fully connected neural network to represent a smaller target model if the LoRA-rank is sufficiently high. Specifically, the required rank is at least the product of the model's width and depth. For Transformer networks, the study demonstrates that a model can be fine-tuned to match a target of the same size using LoRA adapters of a particular rank. These theoretical assertions are underpinned by practical numerical experiments.\n\nThe paper concludes by highlighting the importance of LoRA's rank and the pre-trained model's depth in achieving close approximation to the target model. Despite these advances, it points out that the construction method for LoRA adapters might not be fully optimized and that better parameter efficiency could be achieved with more refined techniques. The paper also calls for additional research to measure approximation errors when LoRA-rank is not ideal, especially in the context of Transformer networks, and to further explore the application of LoRA in more complex network architectures."

                "value": "The experimental approach raises significant concerns. Given the widespread application of LoRA to various large language models (LLMs), such as LLaMA, there's an opportunity for the authors to substantiate their findings using models tasked with different challenges. Considering the availability of various model sizes in LLaMA and the comprehensive range of results provided by the original LoRA study, a comparison between the proposed theoretical analysis and empirical observations of LoRA would be insightful.\n\nThe use of Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a metric in the authors' presentation is questionable. Performance scores for LLMs typically exhibit a weak correlation with perplexity (PPL) or loss values. Therefore, relying solely on MSE for validation, particularly in the context of generative AI, may not adequately address the nuances of expressive capability. A multifaceted evaluation, including different performance metrics, would offer a more robust validation of the claims made in this work.\n\nAdditionally, it is acknowledged within the community that even very low ranks (such as 4, 2, or even 1) can yield satisfactory fine-tuning results. Readers would benefit from an exploration into how low-rank adjustments are able to achieve effective fine-tuning. The experimental outcomes presented in the paper currently do not offer practical insights for practitioners working with LoRA-based tuning, who would be looking for such guidance.\n\nThe authors are urged to establish a clearer connection between their theoretical discoveries and the empirical results previously reported for LoRA. Doing so could significantly streamline the hyper-parameter selection process for LoRA, reducing the effort required to fine-tune models effectively."

Many methods were proposed to selectively update smaller parameter subsets or introduce lightweight adapters, significantly reducing computational and storage costs. The dominant method in this context is Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which employs low-rank adapters to pre-trained weight matrices. Empirical evidence shows that LoRA can match or surpass the performance of full fine-tuning. However, there is a lack of theoretical understanding regarding how LoRA works, including questions about the minimum rank of adapters required for effective adaptation and how model architecture influences this threshold. Addressing these theoretical questions will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and principles behind LoRA's adaptation of LLMs."
