                "value": "In general, I like the idea of cycle consistency argued by the paper, and the connection to TSP is very stimulating.. However, and this is preventing me from giving an higher score, there are a number of issues with this paper. Provided that some of them are solved during the discussion phase, I will be willing to change my evaluation.  Here are potential questions and remarks for the authors :\n\n- Existence of solution for Eq 9 should be discussed. Notably, it seems that as soon as there is mass splitting or whenever one measure has a small number of atoms, the composition (product) of couplings can not yield identity (as soon as there might be rank deficiency in the coupling matrix), and the feasible set is empty. In the reviewer\u2019s opinion, this should be detailed or analyzed. \n\n- Regarding the optimization part, there is no clear justification for the alternating scheme proposed here (solving sinkhorns, then updating the cost matrix for every sub-problems). I think there might be connections to Generalized Conditional Gradients or Majoration-Minimization methods here (as the ones used in the POT library). I encourage the authors to better justify their algorithm 1. Also, what is the impact of the entropy parameter $\\epsilon$ in solving the problem (10) ? How do you set it ? How many iterations wrt. K are needed for finding a solution ? In the reviewer\u2019s opinion, this would deserve a discussion in the paper. \n\n- Authors do not mention the case when K=2. However, I believe that it might also be interesting. In the case where the number of samples (atoms) is the same in the two distributions (with uniform distributions), we have obviously that $P P^T = Id$ but when  mass splitting occur,  it is not always the case. What is then the impact of the regularization on the original sinkhorn problem ?  \n\n- In the applications of OMT (visual point matching, or neural model fusion), how do you define the sequences/orderings of measures ? Are there any change in the performances if one changes this ordering (as we can expect because of the non-commutativity of coupling matrices product) ?  More generally, and as soon as K>2, I guess that the choice of the cycle (when given a set of input measures) is in itself a problem. It could be better discussed in the paper  \n\nMinor comments\n - in Eq 7 the first k should be a capital K\n- I do not really understand the difference between Eq. 10 and 17 \n- Figure 3 could be enhanced to better distinguish the differences between the two versions of the transport plans, which is difficult to see at a first glance \n- p6, what do you mean by \u2018\u2026 Algorithm 2 can not achieve the ideal closed-loop solution which may be\ndue to the simple setting of \u03b4k and too many regularized terms of closed-loop constraints\u2019 ? \n- in Multi point matching, performance measures such as CR or CACC show a bias toward the presented method, since it directly relates to the criterion which is optimized."

In fact, it is not much different from the one using Sinkhorn. \n\nI do not agree with other two metrics, i.e CR and CACC,  assessing the performance of methods, since they favor the author's method.\n\nIn the problem of multi-matching and model fusion, I do not see that the method is natural application to those problems unless the data sets have cyclical structures. From Figure 5 for example, I do not see the data have that cyclical structure, if we switch the order  of pictures of the second column and third column, does it change the final results? The most natural applications, among those presented, of the method is TSP, but the empirical result is still worse than its current SOTA result. \n\nWith the cycle consistency requirement, the problem wants a solution which is a permutation matrix at every transportation stage, since product of \"transition\" matrices, (all entries are non-negative),  must be equal to identity matrix. Hence the real constraint is to make the transport maps are close to permutation.  The objective function (17) is just a relaxed version of the true objective function. What is the guideline for choosing the parameter $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$? \n\nOverall, it appears to be interesting problem. But it also appears to be a slightly different version of multi-OT problems, thus it looks like an incremental solution to some current methods.

Another simple baseline is to iteratively fuse two models.\n- Tab. 3: For CIFAR10 + VGG11, the finetuned accuracy is the same as the best pre-trained one, which raises concerns about efficiency.\n\n**Minor**: \n- The title of Section 2.3 should be only \u201cVisual Point Matching and Model Fusion\u201d because the usage of OT is not mentioned enough.\n- Notation consistency for $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\n- Should use different notations for $\\mathcal{C}$ in Eq. (7) and (8).\n- entropy regularization \u2192 entropic regularization\n- The usage of $\\delta$ as a regularization coefficient should be avoided as $\\delta$ denotes the Dirac measure earlier.\n- \u201cTab. 3 shows the fusion results\u201d This sentence can be removed from Section 3.4.\n- Some typos"
