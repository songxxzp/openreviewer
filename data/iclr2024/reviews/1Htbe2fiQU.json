This approach may not capture scenarios where multiple patches collectively contribute to a counterfactual result, which could be a critical aspect in understanding complex medical images.\n\n- Addressing multiple patches simultaneously would lead to a computational complexity of 2n2n, which is not practical. The authors should acknowledge this limitation and discuss potential ways to manage this complexity, or propose alternative strategies to handle multiple patches.\n\n- The use of prompts in the methodology is unclear and seems inconsistent. Typically, prompts should be uniform across tasks to ensure consistency. However, Figure 4 suggests that the prompt includes image-specific information, which could create confusion. The authors need to clarify their use of prompts and maintain a consistent approach throughout.\n\n- Section 3.1 of the methodology, which covers existing concepts and methods, seems misplaced. It would be more appropriate to move this content to the related work section, allowing Section 3.2 to solely focus on the novel aspects of the proposed framework. This would streamline the paper and highlight the unique contributions of the work.\n\n-  To convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, the authors should present results based on the best counterfactual images generated at the end of training.
