It is proposed to design a generator of such time series from limited observation data.Those data being limited in the sense that only two patterns type are considered as available. The aim of this paper is then to be able to generate 'intermediate' patterns. This is performed through the use of recurrent auto-encoder with a conceptor-based regularization. This conceptor-based regularization is based on two folds: (1) ensuring a close representation of patterns and (2) ensuring close conceptors for each pattern. \nFrom this trained recurrent auto-encoder, a linear interpolation of conceptors is proposed to generate intermediate patterns.\n\nExperimental results are reported on sine-wave patterns and MoCap motion modelling."

It is hard for me to judge the practical significance of the problem settings of the work, learning a continuous spectrum of representations that can interpolate between two training examples. The work mentioned related works of interpolatable representation learning in different areas, including locomotion modelling, robotics, and reinforcement learning. None of the mentioned work studies problems settings even close to the proposed setting. The proposed setting also restricts the approach to a two-shot learning setting and it is not clear how the approach can be extended to few-shot learning settings with more training examples and if the proposed approach would still have any practical value when larger amount of training data is available, which is not unusual in practice. \n2. The proposed CARAE is based on an artificial RNN model with specific architecture designs, which is different from more commonly used RNN architectures like LSTM or GRU. Extending CARAE to these more common RNN architectures or more recent transformer architecture could significantly improve its practical value.\n\nApart from my concerns on practical significance, the work also have the following minor weakness:\n1. In Sec. 5, the work uses *two data sets* and *two distinct examples* to call $u_1$ and $u_2$ which can be confusing. It would be much more clear if $u_1$ and $u_2$ are referred to as two training examples consistently in the work.\n2. The work only presents qualitative results and training loss curves.
