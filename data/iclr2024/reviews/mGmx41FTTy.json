                "value": "The paper addresses the problem of causal discovery in a time series setting where data from two time slices are given. To do this, the authors propose an approach that identifies the topological order and results in a smaller number of potential edges, which simplifies the pruning problem. The suggested approach utilizes independence tests and the lagged time series structure. In the experiments, the authors compare different causal discovery approaches on artificial data and one real-world dataset."

Section 10 of the book \"Elements of Causal Inference\" could help in formulating a clearer problem statement.\n- Novelty is unclear, since Theorem 1 seems to follow directly from the assumed lagged time structure (see Question section for details).\n- While there is comparison with a broad range of methods, they are mostly designed for the IID setting rather than the time series setting. \n- The functional form in Eq. (1) is more restrictive than the referenced additive noise model class."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "My main concern is the unclear positioning of the paper. It refers to DAGs and compares approaches designed for IID data (e.g. PC, FCI, etc.) but in a time series setting, mixing the definitions. A much cleaner definition of the problem setting and introduction of \"time slices\" is needed, especially the connection between observations at different times as interventions. \n\nSome remarks and questions:\n- You refer to \"unique orderings\" of the topology. However, this appears impossible since equivalent orderings exist (e.g. X \u2192 Y \u2190 Z has completely equivalent orderings (X,Z,Y) and (Z,X,Y)). If the \"uniqueness\" refers to something else, then this should be clarified early on.\n- After the introduction, it is unclear why the problem isn't an edge pruning problem, as mentioned later. It is unclear why the 'naive' approach of pruning edges after obtaining the causal order is insufficient.\n- Consider avoiding the use of notations that has not yet been introduced, such as X^t-3 in the introduction.\n- You write \"two time-slides data\" at the end of the introduction. What is a \"slide\" here?\n- The related work is mostly IID approaches with very limited discussion of time series approaches. Why is this?\n- You mention causal discovery algorithms identify the equivalence class, which is true for some (e.g. PC, FCI) but not all (e.g. NOTEARS aims to recover the whole DAG). \n- When you mention 'DAG', do you refer to the summary graph? This should be clarified.\n- Defining X_i as a random variable does not make sense in the time series setting, where X_i^t is a random variable (with typically only one observation). See Section 10 of \"Elements of Causal Inference\".\n- Equation (1) is more restrictive than an additive noise model. An additive noise model is defined as Y = f(instantaneous parents, all other lagged parents) + N in a time series setting. In your case, you restrict the lagged variables to be separate functions and has only an additive influence. This seems quite restrictive.\n- The time slice definition is confusing. You mention an initial slice from 1 to t-1 and the present is t. Where is the gap between them? \n- Assumption 1 seems flawed. X^t should be independent of X^t-i-k given X^t-1, ..., X^t-i since any previous lag could directly impact the current time lag (skip connection), rendering them dependent. \n- Definition 2 is unclear. What about X \u2192 Y \u2192 Z? It has 3 layers (X)_L1, (Y)_L2, (Z)_L3. By the definition, L1 > L3, so X has a direct edge to Z, which would be wrong?\n- Theorem 1 seems to follow directly from the lagged structure and Markov property. A discussion comparing it to Section 10.3 of \"Elements of Causal Inference\" and the paper \"Necessary and sufficient conditions for causal feature selection in time series with latent common causes\" by Mastakouri et al. would be helpful.\n- Unclear why a time slice is an intervention. It seems a time slice just means recorded at different times (i.e. with a time gap)?\n- How do you apply the IID algorithms like PC and FCI to the time series setting? Do you just treat it as IID?\n- While the experiments have many approaches in the comparison and different data set sizes, more relevant comparisons to time series methods like Granger causality or VARLiNGAM would be insightful. The functional relationships could also be more general, like neural networks with random weights to generate arbitrary non-linear connections."
