Will EC-Ideal have the same convergence guarantees if you add \\eta in step 6, with the same values as for EControl?\n-Bounded variance: This assumption contradicts strong convexity. I understand it is in several works in the literature. Take for instance F(x,y,z) = zx^2 + (1-z)y^2, z follows Bernoulli (1/2), then E_z(norm(\\nabla F(x,y,z) - \\nabla E_z(F(x,y,z)))^2) = (x-y)^2 and this is not bounded for all x and y in R.\n-You mention in page 7 that \"The asymptotic complexity of EControl in this regime with stochastic gradient is tight and cannot be improved,\"  I understand for the depence on \\epsilon, however can you tell why the dependence on other parameters can not be improved.\n-In the experiments, how you relate \\zeta to the noniddness, why for instance zeta equal to zero is iid and zeta >0 is non idd.\n-Did you try \\eta= delta/400 suggested by the theory in the experiments? why you need to fine tune it, since it is fixed by theory. Is only fixed \\eta = \\delta/400 that works in theory or many other values can work, this is not clear in the paper.\n-Did you test with other compressors?"

EControl utilizes contractive compressors to reduce communication overhead, effectively mitigating issues like unstable convergence and compression bias commonly associated with naive implementations. Notably, EControl's standout feature lies in its ability to regulate error compensation by controlling the feedback signal's strength, making it a valuable solution for data heterogeneous scenarios.\n\nUnlike previous methods, EControl dispenses with impractical assumptions such as bounded gradients or data homogeneity. It demonstrates rapid convergence rates in standard convex and nonconvex settings, showcasing its adaptability and robustness. Through comprehensive numerical evaluations, the paper substantiates the effectiveness of EControl, highlighting its potential to revolutionize distributed training by alleviating communication overhead challenges and facilitating more efficient and stable model training processes."

If we the compressed version of $h$ in the initialization $h_0^i = \\mathcal{C}(g_0^i)$, and take $\\eta = 0$, then EControl will be equivalent to EF21. In other words, with a little bit twist in the initialization, EF21 can be viewed as a special case of EControl. However, I haven't found any discussion about the relationship between EControl and EF21 like this. Furthermore, I recommend to add some ablation experiments where $\\eta$ varies and gets tuned gradually closer to 0, which I guess will give a training loss curve closer to EF21."
