The authors introduce CLaM-TTS, which uses probabilistic residual vector quantization for two main benefits: it significantly compresses token length and enables the generation of multiple tokens simultaneously, eliminating the need for cascaded modeling. Experimental results show that CLaM-TTS performs on par with or better than existing zero-shot TTS baselines in terms of naturalness, intelligibility, speaker similarity, and inference speed. The study also explores how the pretraining extent of language models and their text tokenization strategies affect performance."

CLaM addresses two critical issues in the field, demonstrating sufficient novelty and contributing meaningfully to the existing body of research.\n\n- The experiments conducted are comprehensive, effectively demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed methods. The completeness of these experiments lends credibility to the findings and supports the conclusions drawn in the paper.\n\n- In terms of RTF, the CLaM-TTS model exhibits superior speed compared to the Voicebox and Vall-E TTS models. This enhanced performance highlights the advantages of the proposed approach."

Once this part of the network is trained, the authors propose to train latent language model with a gaussian mixture based decoder that attempt to sample codes that would match the ground truth.

CLaM-TTS combines several ideas from the literature into a single model trained on several large-scale datasets and demonstrates high-quality speech generation. The input to this model is text and the output is mel spectrograms, which must then be converted to audio waveforms using a vocoder.\n\nThe model consists of the following components:\n\n1. Audio quantizer: They introduce Mel-VAE, a model for encoding mel spectrograms into a sequence of multi-dimensional discrete codes. The Mel-VAE decoder is used to convert the discrete codes back into mel spectrograms during inference.\n2. Autoregressive synthesis network: A conditional language model is used to convert text into discrete codes. The language model is conditioned upon text (encoded by a pretrained network) and autoregressively predicts discrete audio codes. \n\nThe audio quantizer is based on residual vector quantization (RVQ). Unlike traditional language models which use a softmax output layer to predict discrete codes, the CLaM-TTS synthesis network instead uses a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in order to predict a continuous output, which is then converted into a discretized output using the Mel-VAE RVQ quantizer.\n\nThis system is then trained on 100k hours in multiple languages and evaluated on a number of metrics, including speaker similarity, MOS, and ASR-based intelligibility and WER, demonstrating competitive performance."

This approach elegantly avoids having to build a conditional multi-level sampling scheme, which is expensive at inference time. \n\nThe baselines used for this paper are recent and strong, and the metrics used to evaluate the result are also thorough and varied.
