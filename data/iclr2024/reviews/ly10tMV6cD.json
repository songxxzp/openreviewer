The presentation is poor and can be further improved. I suggest the authors clearly state what kind of benchmark they are constructing in their introduction - I did not understand it until Section 3, and then realized that it was a QA format. Also, there is no reference in their Section 1, while most statements need supporting evidences/references.\n\nAlso, I would like to remind the authors that it is not a proper manner to put most of their key results in the Appendix (and no discussion and analysis is given!) - reviewers are NOT asked to read their appendix."
