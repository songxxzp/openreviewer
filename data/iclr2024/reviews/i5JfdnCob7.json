A term-by-term comparison between the equations of these two score functions could provide valuable insights into the sources of their respective strengths and weaknesses.\nThe use of Gaussian process for $f$ is noted as advantageous for preventing overfitting and negating the need for explicit training of f. However, this brings with it a computational complexity of $O(n^3)$?\n\nIn terms of empirical validation, the paper focuses on demonstrating the learning of simple bandwidths. To underscore the method\u2019s versatility and general applicability, consideration of more complex kernels, such as deep kernels, would be beneficial.\n\nOn the matter of clarity, questions arise regarding the method\u2019s performance under non-Gaussian noise conditions and whether Equation 13 can be derived in such scenarios.

                "value": "1. I don't quite follow the first example given in the Motivation section by the authors to attack the weakness of Huang et al. 2018. The authors give an example to show the dependency between the error and the regressor under the RBF kernel, boiling it down to the inadequate model capability to capture the causal relationship. As I understand it, the linear function class on the RKHS induced by RBF kernel is capable to be consistent with any underlying model. For example, Theorem 8 of \"On Consistency and Robustness Properties of Support Vector Machines for Heavy-Tailed Distributions\" ensures the consistency once the RKHS is dense in the L$_1$ space, while Theorem 4.63 of \"Support Vector Machines\", https://pzs.dstu.dp.ua/DataMining/svm/bibl/Support_Vector.pdf proves that the RKHS of the RBF kernel is dense in L$_p$ for $p \\geq 1$. Instead, an alternative explanation may be the finiteness of samples in practice. Another problem is that the term \"correlated\" is not equivalent to \"dependent\"; the error seems to be linearly uncorrelated with the regressor. \n\n2. I also have some questions on the second example given in the Motivation section. I think if one is going to test the (conditional) independence of X_1 and X_3 given X_2, they should regress X_1 on X_2 and X_3 on X_2 and compute the correlation between the errors according to Huang et al. 2018. I wonder about the explanations of regressing X_2 on X_1 instead and the reason why it leads to a spurious edge between X_1 and X_3.\n\n3. The algorithm proposed by the authors is to maximize the marginal log-likelihood \\log p(X = x, PA = pa | f, \\sigma_x), while the corresponding term in Huang et al. 2018 is \\log p(X = x | PA, f, \\sigma_x). What is the difference in their dynamics that leads to potential performance differences needs more discussion\uff1f"

                "value": "The paper proposes a kernel-based method for causal discovery. The criterion for the dependency estimation is derived through mutual information between noise term and independent variables. The main claim is that kernel hyper-parameters can be optimized by the proposed criterion, which can be seen as the marginal likelihood of the joint distribution. The performance is verified through synthetic and benchmark function."
