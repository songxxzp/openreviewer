                "value": "This paper proposes simple and effective method for dataset distillation. Since Back Propagating Through Time (BPTT) is computationally expensive, we truncate a trajectory of inner  optimization steps, called truncated BPTT. However, the performance of truncated BPTT is worse than BPTT due to the biased gradient. In order to get better trade-off between computational cost and performance, the paper proposes to sample random window of inner trajectory, which uses the same amount of computational cost as the truncated BPTT but with better performance. Moreover, it proposes \"Boosted Dataset Distillation\" to mitigate intercorrelation between distilled images, where it iteratively learns to distill a dataset into a small set while setting the learning rate of previously distilled instances to small value."

If the dataset becomes large, we may need large $M$ for convergence at inner loop, which hinders scalability of the proposed algorithm.\n\n- It is hard to analyze why the proposed method helps improving performance compared to BPTT or truncated BPTT.\n\n- The paper requires more comprehensive empirical experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. First and foremost, the authors of the paper did not conduct experiments for architecture generalization. While Table 1 simply demonstrates the method's ability to generalize from a shallow convnet to a wide convnet, I believe this is not adequate. I am curious about how the proposed dataset distillation method can be applied to other architectures, such as VGG, EfficientNet, and ResNet. Secondly, I wonder the proposed method scales to ImageNet dataset which has 1000 classes. \n\n- There is no comparison of computational cost between the proposed method and the other baselines. I think the proposed method is way more expensive than other baselines (such as FrePo) which simplify the  inner loop."

Notably, all existing distillation techniques use SGD. Is this the main reason for improvement compared to other techniques? How does RaT-BPTT (SGD) compare with RaT-BPTT (Adam)? I would suggest referring to [5] for a better understanding of using Adam in data distillation.\n\nI'd be happy to consider increasing my overall rating if some of these questions are addressed in the rebuttal.\n\nOther comments and suggestions (not used in deciding my overall rating):\n- Please include full-data performance in Table 1.\n- The meta-gradient of SGD in the inner-loop can be efficiently computed [6].
