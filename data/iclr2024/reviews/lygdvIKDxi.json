These attacks allow adversaries to create a substitute model that mimics the original model by querying the black-box model with unlabeled inputs. The paper introduces SEEKER, a query-efficient model extraction framework that leverages semi-supervised public knowledge transfer. The framework incorporates an offline stage for pre-training the substitute model without any query costs, a semantic alignment scheme, and a multi-encoder query generator. Experimental results indicate that SEEKER significantly improves query efficiency while maintaining high accuracy and attack success rate (ASR) compared to state-of-the-art methods."

If so, what is the query efficiency just a side effect? We need more justification that only experimental results. \n2. The paper presents a complex methodology without providing much intuition. I can get a main idea of whole methodology. But the motivation of each part is not clear. For example, in section 3.2, why a good framework should be designed this way."

Among other things, doing so allows whitebox adversarial attacks to be used to target the victim model. This particular paper proposes two major components for improving such attacks. The first is a semantic alignment, done both as offline pre-training and during querying. The second is a way of parallelizing the query generation process by encoding the information of multiple samples into a single sample. The result is a method that is much more query-efficient than prior methods, gaining high substitute model, fidelity, and attack success rate with far fewer queries, while also being strong in the large query regime as well."

This is important as a large number of queries renders a method slow and computationally expensive, while also significantly raising the risk of being detected (and stopped) by the target system. Figure 5 effectively illustrates how much faster the substitute model\u2019s metrics can improve using the proposed approach vs the baseline methods. Highlight claim is that this can be up to 50x more query efficient.\n\n## S2. Empirical Results\nThe empirical results of this paper are generally strong. Again, Figure 5 provides an excellent summary, showing higher accuracy, fidelity, and ASR vs competing methods, with fewer number of queries. At the (very) high query range, the proposed approach also shines (Table 2), barely edging out DFMS-SL. Results also appear to generalize to other model architectures (Table 3).\n\n\n## S3. Generally clearly written\nThe paper is clearly written and easy to understand. That said, the paper could still use another round of editing: there are a few typos, some potential improvements to the technical notation, and a number of other issues to fix (see Miscellaneous under Weaknesses). Overall though, this paper was easy to read."

                "value": "## W1. Novelty\nSemantic consistency is presented as one of the two methodological improvements proposed by the authors. The concept, however, doesn\u2019t strike me as particularly new. Offline semantic alignment is simply self-supervised pre-training on a different dataset (very reminiscent of [b], in fact); it\u2019s not particularly surprising that this is helpful, as that\u2019s more or less the whole point of self-supervised learning. The similarities in Grad-CAM visualizations doesn\u2019t necessarily have much to do with model extraction: it may be more due to having stronger features, which presumably the victim model also has, resulting in strong correlation. Online semantic consistency is more or less just knowledge distillation [d] with augmentations.\n\n## W2. Aggregation Design\na) Why the query perturbation/residual is added to the first input sample $x_{pub,1}$ (as opposed to, say, $x_{pub,2}$) isn\u2019t clear and seems like an arbitrary choice. It would seem like there could be a smarter way to select which of the $m$ samples to chose as the base sample. \\\nb) It\u2019s also not clear to me why there is a separate encoder per query index. As far as I can tell, the relative ordering of queries within a parallel batch is not meaningful, so there doesn\u2019t seem to be any added value behind having separate encoders, vs just having a single shared encoder or some other permutationally invariant design (e.g. a transformer).\\\nc) I don\u2019t fully understand the design of the reconstruction loss. Why do we care about reconstructing the input data? We already have the input data. Rather than generating new images through an encoder and decoder, what about simpler methods like MixUp or CutMix? The formulation in Equation 3 also involves a significant number of hyperparameters $\\alpha_j$ to tune, and it\u2019s not clear why they should be meaningfully different; as in b) above, it doesn\u2019t seem like the order of the samples have any inherent meaning, so why for example should $\\alpha_2 \\neq \\alpha_3$?\n\n## W3. Source of empirical improvements\nThe ablation study in Section 4.4 is very helpful, but it\u2019s also somewhat concerning too. From this table, it appears that the offline semantic alignment is the bulk of the source of improvements. While doing this offline semantic alignment is reasonable, as stated in W1 above, it\u2019s really another name for starting off with a stronger substitute model through standard self-supervised pre-training, which is already well known by the community to be generally effective for many downstream tasks. The form of self-supervised learning used by the authors is fairly standard, so it\u2019s not clear to me if this really can be counted as the authors\u2019 contribution.\n\n## W4. Section 4.5\nAnalysis of the proposed method\u2019s performance against defense mechanisms is welcome, but most of the actual results (particularly the paragraph on \u201cPassive Defenses\u201d) appear to be absent from the main paper and deferred to the Appendix. If these analyses are going to be introduced in the main paper, then at least some quantitative results should be included.\n\n## Miscellaneous:\n- pg 2: \u201cMosafi et al.(Mosafi et al., 2019)\u201d <= use in-text citation\n- pg 3: \u201cwith [a] generative adversarial network\u201d\n- Section 2.2: This section leaves out transfer-based blackbox attacks, which generate attacks on the attacker\u2019s own model, which are then given to the target (victim) model. Such approaches have also been combined with query-based attacks, with very low query requirements, e.g. [a].\n- pg 4: \u201ca[n] aggregated\u201d\n- pg 4: Why not denote $x_{pub}$ as $x_p$ instead, to match $D_P$?\n- pg 4: \u201c$i$-th query dataset\u201d <= isn\u2019t this just a sample and label, not a dataset?\n- pg 4: \u201cthat share the same weight[s]\u201d\n- pg 4: This is a standard Siamese network approach to self-supervised learning; more such methods should be cited: e.g. [b,c]\n- pg 5: \u201cwe [a] propose aggregated query generator\u201d\n- Eq 5: If I\u2019m understanding this loss correctly, I think this is for the $i+1$th iteration, not $i$th. Also, as written, this implies we only care about a new query sample not resembling the immediately previous query; this doesn\u2019t prevent a query for example from flipping back and forth between two queries.\n- pg 6: \u201cSecond, [w]e design\u201d\n- Fig 5: Caption should mention what dataset this is on.
