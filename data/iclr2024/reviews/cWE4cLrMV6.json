It is well known analysis based on existing methods (SAM, GSAM, GAM). Rather, The new modeling parts of SAM-MTL is gradient decomposition on each task and gradient aggregation based on whole tasks. However, i do not get convinced why these gradient decomposition and re-organization are required in the context of multi-task learning. This is not empirically validated by additional ablation studies.\n\nIn Figure 4, the author claim that suggested algorithms significantly improves the task-wise flatness than ERM algorithm. What if we conduct simple SAM on MTL, not based on your gradient decomposition and re-organization? I conjecture that the flatness would be similar to SAM-MTL, your method. The extensive comparison with SAM variants (SAM,GSAM,GAM) is required.\n\nPlease empirically provide the computation cost increments by applying SAM-MTL.

The proofs and theorems\u2014which the authors claim to be a major contribution of the present work and on which the proposed algorithm is supposedly based\u2014are poorly presented.  In turn, without which, the proposed approach is largely heuristic and lack theoretical support (excluding results that have been established in prior work, i.e., the constituent component of SAM and gradient-based MTL methods).\n\n    - The \"mild assumptions\" are not clearly stated nor justified.  E.g., theorem 2 used the assumption that the loss function is bounded by $L$, which is not mentioned anywhere except in the proof.  Also, please justify and elaborate on the assumption that \"that adding Gaussian perturbation will raise the test error\": is it required for all $\\theta$, or local minima?  It would be best if the assumptions are listed explicitly.\n\n    - The conclusion of theorem 3 looks wrong.  First of all, in the proof, the induction is incorrectly applied\u2014the $\\xi$ cannot alter between cases.  The $\\log1/\\delta$ term in $f^i$ should be $\\log m/\\delta$.  And, does the conclusion not follow theorem 2 directly via a simple union bound?\n\n    - The outer $\\max _ {\\\\|\\epsilon_\\textrm{sh}\\\\|<\\rho_\\textrm{sh}}$ in the statement of Theorem 1 and 3 does not make sense to me.  The max is taken over a vector of $m$ dimensions.  ~~Is the max coordinate-wise?  If so, it should go inside the square bracket.  If not,~~ is the max well-defined?  Or, how is the total order of the vector space defined?\n\n3. Regardless of the above potential issue with the theorem statement, I fail to see the connection between Theorem 1 (or its complete version 3) and the approach in section 4.3, i.e., the idea that \"the worst-case shared perturbation $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{sh}$ is commonly learned for all tasks\".  Specifically, how is computing the worst-case perturbation on each task separately and then aggregate the gradients $\\\\{g^{i,\\textrm{SAM}}_\\textrm{sh}\\\\} _ {i\\in m}$ related to the idea above?\n\n4. As mentioend in point 1 of strengths, there are some grammatical issues and weird word choice that may lead to confusions.  E.g., what is the \"**ultimate** gradient descent direction\" (in the abstract)?  Also, \"is the compliment set\" --> \"is the complement set\"."
