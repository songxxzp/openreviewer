                "value": "This paper presents a new method to model the conditional density in heteroscedastic regression problems. The idea is to convert metric regression to an ordinal regression problem, in which the conditional density is approximated by a number of fixed bins. This is in essence a histogram approach. Unlike most ordinal regression methods, the authors do not consider an underlying latent continuous variable, but they model every bin via a separate neuron propagating from the embedding layer. A softmax operation is used to guarantee that a valid probability density function is returned, but, unlike classification methods, a loss function that incorporates the order in the bins is used during training. \n\nIn a conformal prediction type of experiments, the authors show that this new model results in better prediction sets compared to some baselines for modelling the conditional density, such as quantile regression and kernel density estimation."

                "value": "I do see several important weaknesses. \n\n1. Contributions:\nAfter reading the introduction it was not clear to me what the contributions are. This only became clear to me after reading the experiments. Contributions should be clear from the beginning. To my opinion, the main contribution is proposing a new nonparametric method for modelling the conditional density. However, I don't see any contribution w.r.t. conformal prediction. In the experiments, the authors only consider the standard split conformal prediction, which is arguably not the most useful type of evaluation for heteroscedastic regression problems. I would argue that conditional coverage guarantees need to be analyzed in such cases. This can be established via Mondrian conformal prediction or normalized nonconformity scores, such as normalized absolute residuals. Estimates of the variance could be obtained with any method that models conditional densities, or with methods that directly estimate the variance, such as mean-variance neural networks. So, in that regard, I find the scope and the experimental setup quite limited. \n\n2. Baselines:\nThe authors consider a few other methods for estimating the conditional density, such as kernel density estimation and quantile regression. However, many other methods exist for estimating the conditional density. Since this is the key contribution of the paper, I would like to see a more thorough experimental and theoretical comparison with such methods. Examples of such methods are mean-variance neural networks, conditional transformation models and methods based on normalizing flows. The proposed method estimates the conditional density via a specific histogram. Methods based on nearest neighbors and regression trees also produce histogram-style conditional densities. Another approach to model multimodal distributions is via Gaussian mixtures. So, there is a lot out there already... Where should we situate the new method is this diverse landscape? I would classify the new method as yet another way of modelling the conditional density. Not better or worse than others, perhaps useful in specific situations, such as multimodal distributions, but more discussion is needed.  \n\n3. Limitations of the method:\n- By modelling the conditional density as a histogram, one obtains a very non-smooth approximation of the density. So, that's why interpolation is needed to obtain good nonconformity scores. Some of the other methods that are described above don't have this limitation. \n\n- The number of bins looks like a very tricky hyperparameter to tune. The performance probably highly depends on that hyperparameter. What would be a good way to tune this hyperparameter? Another tricky hyperparameter is the level of entropy regularization. I would assume that the results are also very sensitive to that hyperparameter.\n\n- I believe that the proposed method might work reasonably well for multimodal distributions that are not too complex, but I would not recommend this method for unimodal regression problems. For such problems, there are too many degrees of freedom.\n\n4. Unclear aspects of the experiments\n- In Table 3 a lot of standard deviations are zero, or close to zero. How is that possible? What is randomized? With randomizations of the testset these numbers are unrealistically small I would say. \n- Table 1 versus Table 3: normally one would see that the length of the intervals increases when the coverage increases. So, the two criteria highly depend on each other. Any comparison of two methods should always make the trade-off between those two criteria."

E.g., Sec 3.1, \"We  aim to compute... classification context\" does not add much. In the end, you have a traditional neural network with softmax output, which everyone understands. Similarly the comment \"This approach is both straightforward and efficient ... information or structure.\" does not add anything substantial. Sec 3.2 \"It would be desirable to be able to use similar methods for both classification and regression conformal prediction\". This is a somewhat subjective (and distracting) claim that I believe is best avoided. The paragraph starting with \"These values y\u02c6 \u2208 Y\u02c6 f...\" is unnecessarily verbose. Sec 3.3 introduces a loss function without giving an example of what it could be. \n- Table 1 is very hard to understand since (i) the methods are not connected to the acronyms, (ii) it is not clear what is inside the brackets, (iii) length and coverage is not defined in the paper. \n\n## Technical concerns\n- Most results are not reported with error bars making them less reliable. For instance, in Table 1, CHR does worse than CQR but it should not?
