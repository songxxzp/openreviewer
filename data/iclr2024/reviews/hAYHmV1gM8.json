FedWon eliminates normalization layers and reparameterizes convolution layers with scaled weight standardization to effectively model the statistics of multiple domains. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that FedWon outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. FedWon is versatile for both cross-silo and cross-device FL, exhibits robust domain generalization capability, and performs well even with a small batch size of 1, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices."
