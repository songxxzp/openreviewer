                "value": "Novelty: **Collaborating Networks** [Zhou et al., 2021; [Zhou et al., 2022] have formulated the quantile regression as a bi-level collaborating optimization problem. The authors should compare and analyze the novelty of their work in relation to these studies.\n\nWriting and Organization: The writing and organization need improvement. There are some confusing and contradictory arguments in the main text that the author should clarify further. In the Introduction section, notations X, Y, Z, and E are used before being defined. Figure 1 only shows the dose-response curve of X on Y, which is a typical continuous treatment setting. Additionally, the green nodes are not defined, and the \u03c4-value is also not reflected in the figure. Figure 1 should be an abstract motivation of the problem, but it does not demonstrate the importance of Quantile Regression. I cannot obtain information from this figure that demonstrates Quantile Regression can help estimate causal effects.\n\nRelated Literature and Baselines: This paper is related to the **Quantile Treatment Effect** [Powell, 2020; Xie et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021] and **Collaborating Networks** [Zhou et al., 2021; [Zhou et al., 2022]. It would be beneficial to provide a more thorough analysis with existing quantile causal models.\n\nWrong Critical Statement:  In causal inference, most works assume that the covariates Z are collected before the treatment X is administered, and the outcomes Y are observed after the treatment is implemented. This is fairly common in real-world applications. For example, doctors provide treatment based on the patient's health condition, and these variables also affect the patient's final treatment outcome. I believe that such causal models and assumptions are reasonable and valid. Therefore, I disagree with the author's criticism of the causal models proposed by (Johansson et al., 2016; Yoon et al., 2018; Bica et al., 2020; Liuyi Yao, 2018), claiming that they are often unknown and difficult to identify with limited samples.\n\nPotential Contradictory Statement: There seems to be some inconsistency in the paper. On one hand, the paper states that causal models are often unknown and hard to identify in practical applications with finite samples. On the other hand, the paper relies on the same predefined causal model, requiring covariates Z as a set of common causes for X and Y. This seems to contradict the previous statement.\n\nQuestion: Can the proposed method address unmeasured confounding bias, specifically eliminating the indirect effect from unmeasured confounders, i.e., $E \\not\\perp(X; Z; Y)$?\n\n[Powell, 2020] Powell, David. \"Quantile treatment effects in the presence of covariates.\" *Review of Economics and Statistics* 102.5 (2020): 994-1005.\n\n[Xie et al., 2020] Xie Y, Cotton C, Zhu Y.

Typically, this problem is solved by explicitly representing the causal relationships using unobserved noise terms as input, and subsequently reconstructing the noise to estimate counterfactual outcomes. However, this paper proposes a different approach, modeling counterfactual outcomes as a quantile regression problem. This method utilizes the fact that an intervention do(X = x) results in an interventional distribution for the target variable, while in the counterfactual case, fixing the noise yields a point estimate equivalent to a quantile of this interventional distribution."

                "value": "The paper and method is very interesting, but there are some unclear points:\n\n- The link between quantile regression and counterfactuals within Pearl's framework is not well explained in Section 3. This could be clarified by explaining that typically one obtains an interventional distribution for Y|do(X=x) (rung 2), and the next step, proceeding to rung 3 in Pearl's framework, involves identifying a specific point on this conditional distribution, which is here formulated as a particular quantile of the interventional distribution. This would make the connection much clearer.\n- Large part of the evaluations focus more on the \"interventional\" performance rather than the \"counterfactual\" performance. The average treatment effect evaluation actually assesses E[Y|do(T=0)] - E[Y|do(T=1)], which are quantities derived from rung 2 interventional causal queries that do not require counterfactuals for the estimation. While I see the point of formulating it as the difference over the counterfactual outcomes of individual observations, it actually reduces to the difference between the means of the interventional distributions. Here, additional comparision with point-wise counterfactuals would be more insightful, as done in the related deep-learning literature you are referencing."

            "questions": {
                "value": "The following is a mix of remarks and questions:\n\n- The introduction assumes a good understanding of counterfactuals in Pearl's framework, which may not be the case for all readers. The use of the term \"counterfactual\" varies across the literature, and it is particularly different in the PO framework in comparison to Pearl's framework (due to the explicit modeling of the noise), despite their logical equivalence under certain conditions.\n- In the three-step procedure\u2019s prediction step, it can be clearer specified that estimated noise values are utilized, instead of just mentioning \"U\".\n- After introducing quantile regression in Section 2, at this point already, an explanation of why this problem is statistically simpler than estimating the conditional expectation would be insightful.\n- Many deep learning models cited in related works are not used for comparison, despite being considered state-of-the-art for counterfactual inference. Why not?\n- The paragraph after Theorem 1 needs more clarification: In what scenarios is it not idenfitifiable when using the mean, while it is using quantiles?\n- While you only refer to \"discrete data\", it should be noted that the functional causal models listed (e.g., additive noise model) are intended for non-categorical data. In categorical cases, point estimates for counterfactuals are not possible.\n- In the modeling part of your method, where do assumptions such as monotonicity come into play, and how they are encoded in the model? In the list of models you provide at the end of Section 3, this is for instance encoded by restricting the model classes to ensure invertibility with respect to E. Or in case of an autoregressive flow model, this is given by the invertibility property, etc.\n- You sometimes use \"U\" and sometimes \"E\" for the noise. This could be more consistent.\n- I definitely want to avoid a typical reviewer comment like \"why didn't you compare it with xyz\", but here I see some obvious points: Given the referenced works on counterfactual inference: 1) There is no comparision with the mentioned recent deep-learning works in the experiments. 2) A more direct estimation of the quality of the counterfactuals using artificial data, especially with a larger graph, would provide more insights than estimating treatment effect quantities (like you did in Table 1). As mentioned before, the latter does not even require counterfactual estimates (for Table 2). In this regard, even a simple comparision with additive noise models would be insightful.\n- The PEHE and Rpol metrics are not introduced."

I believe that the Introduction should provide a more detailed explanation of the main idea of the paper. Currently, I am unable to understand how the main idea of the paper is introduced in Section 1. Specifically, I am confused about why $P(Y \\leq Y_{X=x'} | x',Z=0.5) = P(E \\leq -0.5)$. If we are given $X=x'$, then $Y = Y_{X = x'}$. Therefore, it seems to me that $P(Y \\leq Y_{X=x'} | x',Z=0.5) = P(E \\leq -0.5) = 1$ since $Y = Y_{X = x'}$ given $X=x'$.\n\n2. Theorem 1 does not appear to be formal. For instance, it is unclear what is meant by \"corresponds\". Does it mean that they are equal?\n\n3. This paper lacks mathematical rigor, resulting in logical gaps in the proof of Theorem 1. These gaps undermine the credibility and validity of the results. For instance, in the proof of Theorem 1, what is meant by \"$Y_{X=x'} \\vert X=x, Y=y, Z=z$ can be calculated as $f^i(X=x',Z=z,E=e^i)$\"? If this implies that they are equal, please explain the reasoning behind their equality. It appears to me that $f^i(X=x',Z=z,E=e^i)$ represents $Y_{X=x'}(e^i)$ when $Z=z$. Even if $e^i$ is evidence of $(X=x,Y=y,Z=z)$, it does not imply that $Y_{X=x'}(e^i)$ is equal to $Y_{X=x}' \\vert X=x, Y=y, Z=z$. The former is a real value, while the latter is a random variable.\n\n4. Other miscellaneous weaknesses are summarized in the Issues Section below."

Instead, they assume a proxy of the causal model, such as a graph and a distribution (or data that follows the distribution). As an alternative to the graph, the conditional independence embedded by the structural causal model can be assumed (e.g., ignorability). Overall, the availability of the causal model is not assumed.
