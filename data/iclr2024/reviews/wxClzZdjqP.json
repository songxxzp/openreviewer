Moreover, the API of chatgpt has a limitation on the amount of queries per day. How long for one experiment on one API should also be discussed\n\n2. There is no comparison between gpt for argumentation and directly using GPT to do the prediction. [1] show very good node classification results directly utilizing LLM for prediction\n\n3. The Giant baseline is not well-discussed. There should be a clear discussion with GIANT, showing the difference and the contribution of the paper\n\n4. The proposed method seems to be just comparable with GIANT while being much more expensive. Moreover, in table 1, GIANT on Hist can reach a performance of 74.16 which should be the second best method. \n\n5. The selected datasets do not include the large-scale ogbn-product dataset. \n\n6. The motivation for the TACL is still lacking. Why does this method fit in the LM than other GCL methods? \n\n7. What is the novelty of the LLM as a text encoder?

For instance, in the case of the arXiv dataset, the zero-shot accuracy of 73.50 achieved with GPT-3.5, as reported in [1], sets a baseline for comparison. The independent reasoning approach employed for node feature augmentation in this paper essentially replicates the zero-shot task, where the model is provided with the paper's title, abstract, and an instruction to classify the paper. Given this, the expected outcome should be at least matching the accuracy achieved by this straightforward baseline. However, the results on the arXiv dataset do not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LLM-augmentation+ GCL method, especially if it doesn't outperform vanilla LLM performance. A potential solution could be to report the accuracy of node classification following both independent reasoning and structure-aware reasoning in the node feature augmentation. \n- Similar concerns arise with the performance on the PubMed dataset, where the reported zero-shot accuracy is 93.42. \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Harnessing Explanations: LLM-to-LM Interpreter for Enhanced Text-Attributed Graph Representation Learning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19523"
