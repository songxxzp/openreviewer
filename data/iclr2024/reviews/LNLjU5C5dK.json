                "value": "The paper proposes a novel alignment strategy as a replacement of the RL step in RLHF. This is motivated by the observed unstabilities in PPO, and the complexities involved in online optimization. The idea is to mitigate the limitations from behavior cloning by proposing expert annotations that are actually generated by GPT using the generations of the agent as a form of conditioning. Moreover, the training samples are selected thanks to an external reward model. They also include additional information during the supervised fne-tuning by over-weighting the key modifications/deletions. The proposed FIGA improves performances compared to baselines. They ablate the performances."

This is a huge limitation. Moreover, this should be ablated against other strategies that would also use gpt-3.5-turbo, such as distillation strategies.\n- More generally, the experiments lack many important baselines, in particular DPO [Rafailov2023].

Not sure if this would help, but what might happen if you were to optimize by e.g., not using $\\hat{Y}$ and $\\tilde{Y}$ in their entirety, but doing more \"atomic\" changes like only changing one span at a time? Is it too difficult to align the spans? \n\n--thoughts on using this kind of method for tasks requiring even longer outputs? since i wonder if this fine-grained feedback is more valuable in longer-context settings, so i wonder if you would get larger performance gains compared to baselines. though those tasks might be more challenging to evaluate.\n\n--how consistent are the revisions from ChatGPT having smallish levenshtein distance between $\\hat{Y}$ and $\\tilde{Y}? any analysis (even qualitative) on how good ChatGPT's categorization of the 4 types of issues is, and how good are its revisions at addressing these? would be curious to see this analysis since it could point to potential future directions for improvement\n\n(note- i suggested a few different things here. to be clear, i definitely don't expect further experiments on all or even any of these.)"

The authors argue that the current paradigm of only giving the developed model (\"rollout model\") the quality label (e.g., good or bad) of the demonstration and instructing the rollout model to imitate human-preferred responses is insufficient, as the rollout model may not fully capture the correct alignment behaviors. Therefore, this training paradigm can make the rollout model suffer from the distribution shift between its own outputs and imitated outputs. \n\nThe author proposes to bridge the gap of this distribution mismatch by creating a surrogate target that is more similar (tries to maintain a small edit distance) to the model's original low-quality outputs, but is of better quality. The creation of such a target is mainly done by first using a pretrained reward model to filter out queries where the model gives low-quality output, and then instructing ChatGPT, the state-of-the-art LLM, to compare the developed model's original outputs and the human-preferred and do minimum edits to improve the original outputs. \n\nThe authors build a new dataset SPA based on previous human preference datasets by replacing the human demonstration with the surrogate target and training the developed model to edit its outputs to surrogate targets via a token-wise loss. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over various tasks."

                "value": "1. **Narrowed Application Range**: It seems the proposed dataset creation method is strongly biased by the rollout model checkpoint and the reward model used for identifying low-quality outputs. As each rollout model and reward model combination may have different failure modes, it is not clear if the practitioners want to switch to other rollout models and other reward models, how much this dataset can still be helpful. It can be an unreasonably large consumption of computation power if we need to re-apply the proposed method for every rollout model and reward model checkpoint. This might be the problem for almost all human preference datasets as they also use rollout outputs from some model (e.g., Anthropic HH-RLHF uses Anthropic's own LLM outputs), but there seems to be more model-specific limitations for the dataset created by this method as the token-wise label used in the new dataset is also model-dependent. It would be better if the author could discuss about how much data is necessary to achieve reasonable performance gain, whether it can be applied to other LLMs (not only Alpaca-7B), and the budget decomposition. \n\n2. **Possible Unfair Comparison to Baseline**: The reviewer noticed that in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3.1, the dataset used for the proposed training method and baseline methods are not of the same size. This may or may not give an unfair advantage to the proposed method. It would be better if the author could verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by subsampling the created dataset to double-check the effect of the dataset size. \n\n3. **Unclear Alignment to Human Preference, and Insufficient Evaluation**:  The goal of Human-LLM Alignment is to make the model outputs more aligned with human values. It is okay to use a surrogate objective to better train the model for optimization purposes. However, it is important to ensure the training is still making progress towards the original goal. Therefore, there should be some evaluation on whether the model trained in the newly proposed way is getting closer to human preference.  A straightforward yet missing \"inherent\" evaluation is comparing the updated rollout model outputs to the original human-preferred ones -- how similar it is, and what is the proportion of samples getting more similar. Also, after training, whether the model truly learn to do \"desired behaviors\"? Has the model learned to avoid any of the aforementioned four types of mistakes? (In Section 3.1) The specific Reward Model can be biased and only reading \"Reward\" numbers at tables hardly gives readers confidence in the alignment performance in terms of human preference. This also applies to other benchmark numbers -- what the model is learning under the proposed method? The current version of the paper lacks analysis on this side. \n\n      As human preference is more complicated than the benchmarks listed in this paper, more careful investigation should be conducted on the user side to understand how such target-changing would influence user perception.  It has been widely reported that GPT-4-based Evaluation (e.g., Vicuna Benchmark) has various biases (e.g., positional bias, verbosity bias, and self-enhancement bias as reported in [1,2,3]) and cannot fully represent humans, so it would be helpful to do the human evaluation to examine the quality of the rollout model outputs after going through the proposed training method. \n\n4. **Unclear Experiment Detail**: Some hyperparameter setups in Section 4.3 seem arbitrary (e.g., in FIGA-contra, FIGA-reward and FIGA-fix). Why does the author set up the hyperparameter like that?\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Zheng, Lianmin, et al. \"Judging LLM-as-a-judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena.\" NeurIPS 2023. \n\n[2] Wang, Peiyi, et al. \"Large language models are not fair evaluators.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.17926 (2023).\n\n[3] Pezeshkpour, Pouya, and Estevam Hruschka. \"Large language models sensitivity to the order of options in multiple-choice questions.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.11483 (2023)."

                "value": "It seems weird that using \"Average\" scores to compare the models trained under different methods -- the value magnitude of \"Vicuna\" and \"WizardLM\" (\"Reward\" scores are multiplied by 10 as the author noted in the footnote)  are not consistent with performance numbers in other benchmarks, and the test data numbers across different tasks are also not the same. What is the motivation for using this metric?"
