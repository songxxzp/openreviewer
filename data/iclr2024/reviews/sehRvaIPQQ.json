                "value": "This paper proposes a simple but effective technique for improving the \"communication\" between two or more LLMs when \"debating\" about an answer (called CIPHER). Instead of the LM generating natural text with some token sampling technique (e.g., temperature, nucleus etc.) that is then passed to the other LM in the input context, this work generates token representations that are a weighted average of the full vocabulary. The weights are determined by the softmax predictions. So instead of natural text, the sequence of aggregated representations is passed to the other LM. The final answer is generated in natural language by falling back to the regular token sampling technique.\n\nAuthors experimented with several LLaMA models on a few reasoning tasks and found this technique to improve the final answer after a few rounds of debate between two models by 1-3.5%."

                "value": "While the idea of enriching the communication across models is exciting, I believe there are several shortcomings in the current work:\n\n1. The method requires access to the output embeddings of the model and the full output probability, so cannot be directly applied to LLMs served via API.\n2. While there method is described in several sections, the definition of the method still didn't feel precise enough. For example, I assume that at each step of the autoregressive generation the input token embedding is the previously aggregated token embedding and not a single sampled token? Or do you still sample tokens for decoding and just convert the full sequence to aggregated embeddings after?\n3. There is a lot of discussion on the effect of sampling temperature, including ablation experiments etc., that I am confused about. From my understanding of the method (e.g., Equation 2), there is no temperature parameter in the method. The only effect of temp is in the final generation of the answer by one of the models. Therefore, I don not understand why are two temperatures reported, or the ablation in Figure 5.\n4. The experimental results are only on 4 datasets and the improvements are relatively small, and no confidence intervals are reported.\n5. I didn't see any discussion on validation set for hyper param setting, and according to the appendix it seems like different temperatures were used for the main baseline (NLD) and for CIPHER? Why is that? This raises some additional concerns about the experimental setup.\n6. In addition to the point 2, the variants of the method are also not precisely described. For example, on Table 2: \"This issue can be addressed by maintaining a bijection mapping between\nthe vocabulary embeddings of the two models.\" I can guess how it was implemented, but would appreciate elaboration.\n7. Would be interesting to further understand the effect of passing these aggregated embeddings to the model. The communication to later generated tokens is anyway through K,V embeddings of the self-attention that have some dense representations and not limited to the token vocabulary. Some exploration on how the input embeddings impact the K,Vs could perhaps shed some light on how CIPHER modifies the communication"

If an optimization procedure is being used for temperature selection as part of the method, then this should be described in detail along with the rest of the method in Section 3.\n* The temperatures used should all be clearly reported, and whatever process is used for temperature selection should either also be applied to the other baseline methods where relevant, or ablated away in a separate experiment to highlight potential sensitivities to this hyperparameter, or both. \n* In Section 4.1 you say \u201cwe select the response from **the debater operating at the lowest temperature** as the final answer\u201d. But in Section 5.2 you say \u201cTo determine the optimal temperature pairs, we utilize Bayesian optimization (Nogueira, 2014\u2013), and report the accuracies based on the final round response generated by **the first debater**\u201d. These appear to be contradictory.\n* In the caption for Figure 5 you say \u201cbest performance is achieved when temperature 1 is lower than temperature 2\u201d but this is not at all apparent from these plots. The only clear take-away from them is that accuracy is high when temperature 1 is low.\n\nIn many places in the paper the notation and formatting are confusing or nonstandard, making it difficult to read:\n* Using \u201cl\u201d to refer to a token index rather than a layer index\n* Using long names and blocky Courier-esque fonts for variables (e.g. \"$\\texttt{embresponse}$\u201d)\n* Using the direct-sum symbol for concatenation\n* Captions for Table 1 & Table 2 are above their respective figures rather than below. These tables, captions, and their adjacent paragraphs are also extremely close together.\n* The micro-parentheticals in Table 2 make the overall table hard to read without adding much, I would recommend removing these or adding them as supplemental information in the appendix.\n* The heatmap plot in Figure 5 is very hard to interpret.
