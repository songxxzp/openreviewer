                "value": "The key idea is to employ optimal transport for OOD detection which is especially useful in settings where OOD detection is perform on an entire test set of samples rather than a single test sample. The intuition is that, when estimating Wasserstein distance between a training ID set and a test set, OOD test points will be treated differently from ID test points. While I like the general direction of research, I have problems with details on the approach, especially empirical evaluation and it's similarities to recent works.\n\nPost Rebuttal:\nAs per my opinion, the authors seem to lack understanding of literature, missing/ignoring many important baselines. Evaluation is far from thorough. The arguments presented in rebuttal are in particular erroneous. For instance, all the well known baselines include (Garg et al, 2023) are unsupervised, not utilizing or assuming knowledge of a validation set when training OOD detector. Using a validation set obtained from ID set itself~(Hendrycks et al., 2019), is a standard practice for tuning the OOD detector so as to maximize OOD detection on OOD validation set while maintaining 5% OOD rate for ID set. While this is an optional step in all the present methods including (Garg et al., 2023), there is no reason to not utilize outlier exposure in any method. Ignoring this ground breaking work by (Hendrycks et al., 2019) as a justification for missing important baselines is misleading to the community. So I am updating my score to strong rejection. \n\nDEEP ANOMALY DETECTION WITH OUTLIER EXPOSURE. Hendrycks et al. ICLR 2019."

                "value": "My concerns are as following. Similar work is accomplished in (Garg et al, 2023) where, instead of Wasserstein distance, KL-divergence is estimated in its dual form between an ID training set and a test set. From that perspective, these two works are highly similar. Especially, in the dual form, expression for Wasserstein distance and optimal transport are similar. While the authors cite the work in the very beginning of the paper in an abstract fashion, the connections between the two works are completely ignored, be it experiments, theory or methodology. Furthermore, as per my understanding, existing methods perform OOD detection for a given test point whereas the proposed method utilizes entire test set. While it is appreciated that, in continual learning settings, a test set is indeed available for better OOD detection rather than restricting, I would have liked to see details on this in the evaluation setup. How do you relate these two different class of methods in same setup? A lot more details are required on this particular aspects. Furthermore, while the framework of optimal transport is appealing despite being a straightforward extension of the previous work (Garg et al, 2023), the other proposed techniques of using contrastive learning, feature extraction, seem unnecessary. As per understanding, as in (Garg et al, 2023), dual function being a neural or kernel similarity like function, would take care of representation learning (feature extraction, contrastive learning), etc. Otherwise, the approach becomes unnecessarily complex, hard to decipher, and looses it appeal to some extent, especially in the era of end to end learning. Last but not least, experimental evaluation should be more thorough in general and it must include experiments on Imagenet as ID dataset as done in the recent works. In particular, the comparison between CIFAR10 vs CIFAR100 as (ID vs OOD) is not intuitive."

This is both interesting and raises questions. One analogy is the subset of OOD methods that try to fit a density to the test points to do likelihood ratio tests (the density is evaluated on each test datapoint but is the result of learning on all test points). \n\nIf I understand correctly, though you briefly acknowledge using geometry of the whole test set as a motivation, you eventually do not return to a discussion on this particular aspect of the setup. I think it's worth differentiating between methods that use the whole test set for each test point's decision or not. Could you provide more discussion on this (what to take away from it, and what could be inspired by it in the future)? You could potentially consider introducing some new tasks as well such as making decisions on sets of points. Apologies if you discuss this in more detail and I missed it.\n\n- (minor) Could you consider changing the terminology \"score function\" to \"scoring function\" or something similar? \"Score function\" already has a few meanings so for example it's hard to read \"conditional distribution score function\" and not think of \"nabla_u log p(u|v)"
