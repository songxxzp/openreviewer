To use this for generating samples that maximize a user-desired criteria, reinforcement learning can be used for training. However, policy gradient-based optimization methods for reinforcement learning suffer when data is scarce, leading to instability and increasing sample complexity during training. The authors propose to mitigate this problem by making the trained SDE consistent with the associated perturbation process, which is global and covers wider space than training samples. The authors propose actor-critic policy gradient algorithm, and showcase their method\u2019s efficacy on the problem of structure based drug design."

It seems to me that SDE is a tool for distribution modeling (modeling maximum likelihood), and they would like to use this approach to maximize some \"rewards\". If this is what the authors are trying to do, why should I care about distribution modeling? I mean, how does this improve standard optimization approaches, such as local search, monte-carlo tree search, reinforcement learning, etc? Why do I need to use this fancy SDE idea to search for molecules of some good properties? I think the authors have an intricate problem to solve, but the presentation is far from clear.\n\nThe authors need to make the equations and their associated explanations easy to read for general readers. The organization of the paper can be improved to increase clarity. Here are a few questions that the authors may consider clarifying in their revised manuscript. For example:\n\n1.\tIn equation 1, what is sigma_t?\n2.\tWhy is it natural to train SDEs with RL? What if the training data only consist of samples with desired characteristics? Do we still need RL in that case? The authors cited relevant work, but the basic idea/counterexample should be mentioned here (in a sentence)\n3.\tIn equation 5, where is p_t as mentioned afterwards?\n4.\tFigure 1 and 2 needs to be further up in the paper, as they are the motivating examples for authors\u2019 rationale of the paper.\n5.\tIn section 2.3, it is better to state that the MDP is mapping to Equation 5 rather than Equation 1.\n6.\tIn definition 1, what is p0,q0? There are no such symbols in Equation 1."
