This is not surprising to me, because when togetherly trained with sufficiently many epochs, the two models should be in the same basin (as the original LMC suggests), and the direction of interpolation between models is towards the basin while a random direction might not.

The authors can conduct an experiment with a moving window of $l$ layers to show the group-layer-wise connectivity. For instance, given a 20-layer network with $l=5$; the experiments should be conducted: LLMC of 1-5 layers, LLMC of 2-6 layers, LLMC of 3-7 layers, ..., LLMC of 16-20 layers. Current experiments cannot jump to the conclusion that the middle part of layers will cause barriers because you didn't control the variable of the number of aggregated layers $l$. \n* For the convexity of LLMC, I think the current Theorem is not enough and is far from the practice. Theorem 4.1 didn't consider the non-linearity of the neural networks, i.e., the activation functions. I think a more solid theorem should be derived to verify the convexity of LLMC.\n* The discussions on personalized federated learning should be given more focus and I think this is an important point for this paper to have a broader audience and be more applicable to practices. However, I think current implications, experiments, and discussions are not enough. \n    * The methods of personalized layers or layer-wise aggregation in personalized federated learning should be implemented and compared.\n    * Based on the findings of this paper, a new method should be devised, but the paper didn't showcase the applicability by proposing a simple method.\n    * Experiments on feature shift non-iid in federated learning should be conducted to verify the claim that personalized-layer-based techniques can work in feature shift federated learning."

However, from the reviewer's perspective, while the findings are interesting, they may not introduce profound novelty.\n- The presented phenomenon of smaller layer-wise barriers may not be surprising. For instance, if we consider a situation where all layers are created equally, the averaging of only $\\frac{1}{s}$ layers would typically result in approximately $\\frac{1}{s}$ of the loss increase induced by averaging all layers. It is plausible that the observation of Layer-wise Linear Mode Connectivity (LLMC) is due to the averaging of a smaller number of layers rather than a unique layer-wise structure. If the loss increase from averaging $\\frac{1}{s}$ layers is significantly less than $\\frac{1}{s}$ of the loss increase induced by averaging all layers, then this observation would lend more credence to the LLMC conjecture.\n- The theory is for single layer interpolation, whereas the experiments have been conducted on a subset of layers.\n\n### Minor issues\n- There seems to be an error in the author name of the paper \"Which layer is learning faster? A systematic exploration of layer-wise convergence rate for deep neural networks\". The surname of the first author could possibly be Zhou instead of Yixiong Chen.\n- The citations for Singh & Jaggi (2020); Ainsworth et al. (2022); Jordan et al.

In Fig. 2 (a), both middle and deep layer averaging seem to result in high losses, and Fig. 2 (a) implies high losses upon averaging both middle and shallow layers.\n- The layer-wise convexity appears straightforward since the single-layer interpolation $\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}^{(1)} \\ldots\\left(\\alpha \\boldsymbol{W}^{(k)}+(1-\\alpha) \\boldsymbol{W}^{\\prime(k)}\\right) \\ldots \\boldsymbol{W}^{(L)}$ is a linear function of $\\alpha$. The reviewer questions whether interpolating two layers would render $L(\\alpha)$ non-convex.\n- Does \"non-iid\" in Table 1 represent less severe non-i.i.d., and does 'path.' signify pathological non-i.i.d? Why does partial averaging perform better in the pathological non-i.i.d setting than in the less severe non-i.i.d. setting? Shouldn't higher degrees of non-IID reduce performance?"

If averaging the layers does not result in a model with error significantly above the average error of the two initial models, the the two networks are said to be layer-wise linearly mode connected (LLMC). The paper studies for several different networks/datasets the evolution of the error barrier of the full model as well as the error barrier in each layer.  (Note that layerwise error barrier is not \"symmetric\" as you can use either model 1 or model 2 as the base model; the paper presents plots for both.)  The general conclusion is there is often no layerwise error barrier even when there is a barrier for the full model.\n\nThe paper then makes several further contributions.  LLMC is studied for groups of layers instead of just individual layers, and a toy example of a deep linear network is given to demonstrate how there can be no layerwise error barrier when there is a barrier in the full model.  Some attempts at further understanding this phenomenon are presented by looking at the effect of random perturbations in the loss landscape and perturbations in directions related to the training subspace.  Finally, some results are presented in relation to averaging models in federated learning."

I did want to confirm that LLMC is the barrier with respect to *the average error of the two full models* not the average error of one full model and that model with a specified layer swapped.  The latter would not be very informative if this significantly increased the error, but Definition 2 seems to imply the authors used the former.  I would emphasize this before the definition in the paper because readers coming in with intuition from LMC will assume it's the average of the two end points of the interpolation; a figure might also be clarifying, similar to Figure 3 but illustrating how the barrier is computed.\n\nSection 4 and 5.2 are also strong sections in my opinion.  They do a good job of emphasizing the idea that certain layers may provide better directions in the loss surface as compared to averaging the full model (e.g. Fig 4)."

One would then see that the full model has less curvature along the averaging direction as compared to a random perturbation, but a few of the layers have the opposite trend.  The paper states:\n\n```\nMoreover, the networks are much more robust to random perturbations compared to the direction of interpolation between models. This suggests that averaging directions are special in the sense of having much higher curvature than random ones.\n```\nAre the authors referring to just the layerwise results here?  If so this should be made clear because my reading of the plot is this does not hold for the full model.\n\nSecond, is the random perturbation for each layer the size of the norm of the layer-wise interpolation for that particular layer?  This raised the question for me if the results on LLMC were actually better averaging directions in the loss landscape or simply much smaller perturbations to the model. (Also the build up of the error barrier over groups of layers could be increasing the size of the perturbation).  The results in Fig. 4 seem to point to the latter, and *I think this would be an important baseline to include for the other results, i.e. what would the barrier be for a random perturbation of the same size as $\\alpha =0.5$.*  If you get the same result from randomly perturbing the layer there seems to be minimal benefit to doing the averaging.\n\n**Section 6:** In Table 1, these are just the results for different groups of layers, not layers chosen based on the LLMC results.  Is the takeaway just evidence that averaging a subset of layers can be more effective?\n\nIn an application, how would you suggest choosing the layers to average? It seems it would be inefficient in some applications to compute the each layer's barrier every few epochs throughout training."
