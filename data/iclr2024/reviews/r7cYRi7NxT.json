The authors evaluate the approach on both dense prediction (COCO) and the classification-style tasks (VTAB), in a reasonably extensive set of evaluations. The experiments are a strong point of the paper. \n\nOverall I gave this paper a 6, but with some additional experimental validation I would consider increasing my rating."

So I like the setup of the paper.\n\nOne advantage of HST is that, similar to other side-tuning approaches like LST and ST, \u201cgradient computation for the trainable parameters does not requrie backpropagation through the large pre-trained backbone model.\u201d The authors don't mention this, but Fig 2 kind of makes this point. \n\n\n### Experiments:\n\n- Good that the authors included an ablation study on the model components\n- Good experiments and comparisons in VTAB in Table 1\n- Good experiment on multiple architectures using standard learning rate schedules in table 2"

E.g. what happens as you scale up the size of the HST network? I.e. compare the performance as you scale up the training data, network size \u2014 and compare the performance to analogous settings of LoRA\n- The ablation study on VTAB is well-done, but since the paper positions HST as aimed mainly at dense prediction it would be helpful to see a similar analysis on COCO \u2014 or at least the current ablation study broken down over classification/structured/specialized (as in Table 1)\n- The grad-cam visualizations were nice, but were these cherry picked? The results were unsubstantiated with numbers (e.g. object localization via grad-cam) and weren\u2019t really discussed in the paper. I\u2019d either add a discussion or remove the visualizations."

SWIN is hierarchical, or you could use the same linear interp strategy for ViT\n- Why do you think the method outperforms full FT for VTAB, but not as strong for ObjDet/SemSeg? Is this simply a result of COCO being a large dataset? The scaling experiment above might help answer this. \n- Figure 2: Why is the conv stem necessary? What happens when it is excluded?

This paper is motivated by the observation that current PETL methods cannot compare with fully fine-tuning on dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation or object detection, and the proposed side tuning method is targeted at solving this problem. Another related work [1] also proposes a vision transformer adapter for dense prediction tasks. What are the key differences between this work and ViT-adapter, in terms of model architecture, training strategy, etc.?\n\n2. The paper emphasizes the importance of a side network which leverages intermediate activations extracted from the backbone and generates multi-scale features to make predictions. However, the proposed algorithm also incorporates several other designs that share similarity with previous work, for example, adding meta token is similar to VPT [2], and LN-tuning is reminiscent of BitFit [3] which tunes the bias in the network. Although the final results are very promising, it is not clear the improvement comes from the side network or other designs. An apple-to-apple comparison to baselines to show that the side network really matters (no LN tuning, not meta token, etc.) is probably important to support the claim that side network is important for dense prediction.\n\n3. I'm confused by the number of tunable parameters. Table 1 indicates #params is only 0.78M. However, if each side block contains a FFN and they are all tunable, the #params should be way more than 0.78M, since each FFN will contain several millions of parameters.  Why is the reported #param so low?  Please elaborate on how #params is obtained and what is the exact architecture design of side blocks.\n\n[1] Chen, Zhe, et al. \"Vision transformer adapter for dense predictions.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.08534 (2022).\n[2] Jia, Menglin, et al. \"Visual prompt tuning.\" European Conference on Computer Vision.
