Essentially, I believe there are two types of distributions that matter in the context of Diffusion models for offline RL, namely the actual data distribution and the learnable Gaussian kernel (noise) distribution (which is pre-scheduled on the mean values with fixed variance). If the actual learnable $\\pi_\\theta$ is used as the appropriation/predictor of the policy distribution (which I believe is the case according to Eq. 9?), then what is the difference between this proposed paradigm and the Gaussian case, while the latter is believed to be lacking in expressivity, as mentioned by the authors in the intro and Fig.2, however the $\\pi_\\theta$ that you are sampling from is also a Gaussian with known variance and learnable mean value.\n\n- Following my previous point, which I think is also related to the choice of $t$ in Sec. 4.2 and also in Eq. 9. If I misunderstood the actual usage of distribution here, and the proposed SRPO method actually uses the actual distribution, which corresponds to $x_0$ (or somewhere close to $x_0$), as the optimal policy that you are trying to sample from, then the expressivity concern does not exist, but then in this case, the entropy term in Eq. 9 does not hold, because we don\u2019t have any prior on the actual distribution of $x_0$ also on its variance?"

Equation (9) provides a simple trick following equation (8) to show exactly where pre-trained diffusion models can be used for the behavior distribution, where the diffusion model e(a|s, t) can approximate the grad log term of the behavior policy.
