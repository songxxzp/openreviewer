This problem is much more challenging than learning to reject for plain error because, as the authors show, the rejection thresholds for the various classes are coupled. Moreover, no reduction to cost sensitive learning with fixed per-class misclassification costs exist, since these costs change depending on the fraction of examples in each class not rejected.\n\nGiven the challenges, the authors present an approximate scheme for minimizing balanced-error with a reject option, and they compare its effectiveness to recent methods for learning to reject on 3 image classification datasets. The proposed method out-performs or matches the compared-to methods across all datasets.\n\nAdditionally, the authors formulate the Bayes optimal solution for minimum balanced error rate with rejection to one for any metric that is a function of the per-class error rates. This allows for minimizing the maximum per-class error rate, and the G-mean metric; as well as for balancing error rates across an arbitrary partition of classes -- e.g., balancing the error rate across the set of frequent classes and the tail classes."

The problem of 'learning to reject' has been studied before, but mostly in the setting when the performance metric of interest is classification accuracy (or 0-1 loss). In this work, the authors consider more general and practical performance measures, balanced error and worst-group error in particular. The authors derive Bayes optimal classifiers (and rejectors) for the general measures, and provide a practical algorithm for estimating them with samples. \n\nTwo key contributions: 1) Clear formulations of the learning to reject problem, various metrics of interest, and deriving Bayes optimal forms for the different metrics. While general performance measures have been considered before in different supervised learning settings, deriving general results for classifiers with reject option is novel as far as I can tell. 2) Algorithm for estimating the classifiers and rejectors in practice for general performance measures, and supportive empirical results on standard datasets.\n\nOverall, I find the paper to be sufficiently interesting to any ML audience, with technical depth and contributions par for the venue.

For instance, I would love to know if there's an intuitive explanation for the 'discount' factor $-\\mu^*_{[y']}$ in (2). \n2. I found it a bit of a leap to go from deterministic classifiers in Theorem 2 to stochastic classifiers in Theorem 5. Balanced error does involve weights that are distribution dependent, while general $\\psi$ metrics studied in Theorem 5 I believe are functions that do not depend on the distribution in any way other than via the arguments $e_j(h,r)$'s. So where is the stochasticity arising from? Also, it would be good to draw corollaries where for some simple forms of \\psi functions, you indeed get deterministic classifiers and rejectors (when $h^{(1)} = h^{(2)}$ holds, etc.)"
