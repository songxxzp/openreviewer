                "value": "This paper presents LLMZip, an algorithm that leverages the recently developed Transformer-decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) for better compression. In this paper, we study the combination of LLM with various lossless compression schemes and analyze their empirical performance. We also explore how LLMZip's performance can be further enhanced with the availability of side information, such as text summaries. Experimental studies on various datasets are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LLMZip approach, which indicates that LLMZip achieves a better bits-per-character ratio compared to the traditional Zlib lossless compression method."

As mentioned in the introduction, it seems the connection between compression and prediction has been developed decades ago. Using language models for compression has also been explored before, with LSTM and/or RNN being used. Therefore, it appears that the sole contribution of this paper is the substitution of previously explored smaller language models with large language models (LLMs)\n- Only Llama2 has been used as the language model in the experiment. It is unclear how the performance of LLMZip would vary when employing LLMs of different types and sizes.\n- LLMs usually require GPUs for execution, whereas traditional compression algorithms can run on CPUs, which are more widely accessible and easier to democratize.\n- The LLMZip approach presented in this paper appears to be more suitable for submission to an information theory conference or journal, such as ISIT."

The paper's attempt to innovate using the advanced LLaMa2 as an LLM seems to lack strong novelty.\n\n2. Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2, which discuss text compression methods other than arithmetic coding, appear superfluous.\n\n3. The detailed explanation of Arithmetic coding might be redundant; perhaps it would be better placed in an appendix.\n\n4. In Section 2.2 regarding Entropy bounds, the equation H(S) = H(X) / E[B] does not appear to be a significant finding.\n\n5. The use of text-summary for compression seems misjudged. Theoretically, adding bits to describe a summary would only be beneficial if the probability estimation isn't flawless.\n\n6. The claims about the entropy bounds of the English language are debatable. For instance, Table 1 lists 0.6936, while Table 2 cites 0.7741 from a different dataset. The input data chosen for testing does not seem to be a true representation of English text, with entropy rates that fluctuate depending on the input.\n\n7. Minor Remarks:\n- The use of \"It's\" may not be suitable for a formal paper.\n- Terminologies such as $N_{tg}$, $N_{cg}$, and others need clear and precise definitions."
