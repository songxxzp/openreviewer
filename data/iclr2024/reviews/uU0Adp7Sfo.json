                "value": "The paper proposes a new GAN model known as Collaborative-Competitive GAN (CCGAN), aimed at improving existing GANs in tasks such as multi-modal generation and image super-resolution. The authors argue that CCGAN overcomes the limitations of pure-competitive GAN models and other existing collaborative GANs. Essentially, the authors design collaborative regularization as the divergence metric to align the loss functions, reduce complexity in finding optima, and derive closed-form equilibrium points. The experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets for image-image translation, image super-resolution, and a toy dataset for image colorization. They are compared to a few baselines, including COCO-GAN, CollaGAN, and Co-GAN. Additionally, the paper validates the proposed GAN against false data injection attacks. \n\nThe design of collaborative regularization is not entirely new; it bears resemblance to the popular \"trick\" of label smoothing used by the community to enhance GAN stability. There is a question about whether the original GAN loss, combined with regularization, is necessary, as it alone may perform well. However, the paper makes a contribution with its theoretical analysis.\n\nOverall, the paper's structure is easy to follow, and the results show encouragement when compared to some existing GAN methods. Nonetheless, there are many concepts that are not well-defined, and the claims in the paper lack strong empirical support. Most of the experimental results are qualitative, and quantitative results are limited, lacking a comprehensive study on the most significant contribution of collaborative regularization. Many claims in the paper remain unsupported by experimental results. Detailed comments can be found below. I recommend rejecting the paper in its current form."

                "value": "1. The paper presents various claims together with some concepts which are not popular and without definition or explanation, some of which somewhat quite arbitrary. The authors argued that CCGAN overcomes the limitation of a pure-competitive GAN model and other existing collaborative GANs in terms of beyond the \u201cauthenticity\u201d  of data distribution, incorporating \u201cadditional knowledge\u201d. or \u201charmonizing\u201d the loss functions, reducing \u201cdegree of complexity\u201d in finding the optima and deriving closed-form which \u201cserves as a guidance for training and hyper-parameter tuning\u201d. \n\n2. The authors should clarify what form of \u201cadditional knowledge\u201d does the proposed regularization add into? What is \u201cauthenticity\u201d of the data distribution? What is \u201cmutual dependency\u201d and why is it helpful for GANs training to break this? In addition, could the authors conduct experiments to support claims of \u201charmonizing\u201d the loss function, reducing the \u201cdegree of complexity\u201d in finding the optima and how does the regularization \u201cserves as a guidance for training and hyper-parameter tuning\u201d?\n\n3. As mentioned in the paper's introduction, it is not entirely clear to me why replacing the cross-entropy loss with the least square loss or Wasserstein loss fosters collaboration between the generator and discriminator. Could the authors provide clarification on the definition of collaboration and how it is enhanced with these losses compared to cross-entropy?\n\n4. From mathematical perspective, it is unclear why $JSD (p_{data} || \\frac{\\lambda - 1}{\\lambda} * p_{gen})$ is superior than $JSD (p_{data} || p_{gen})$ of original GAN? As the new JSD appears not optimal, regardless of the selected value of $\\lambda$, JSD never converges to optimal values.\n\n5. The regularization appears close to the label smoothing \u201ctrick\u201d which is widely used in GAN training. This suggests regularization again might suffice as a GAN loss. Have the authors explored the impact on results when removing the GAN loss function in this study?\nCan the author explain why the optimal D in Theorem 3 help CCGAN avoid the training collapse?\n\n6. The experimental results are mostly the qualitative results and quite limited. For instance, only one quantitative result in Table 1 for image super resolution. The regularization is the key contribution which needs to be extensively studied but missing in the current form. Could the authors provide the ablation study to investigate the impact on $\\lambda$ and how to select it, as well as how the performance changes with different values of $\\lambda$? \n\nTypo in conclusion: presente"

As I read from the introduction, the authors seem to regularize GANs to learn partial modes or addition restrictions, the so-called learning beyond the authentic distributions. However, the established regularization term does not indicate those intensions. \n2. This paper claims that existing regularized GANs do not have closed-form equilibrium, which is proved based on the very simple Gaussian case. This is not very convincing. Even though, in my opinion, for training GANs, the way to approach the equilibrium is more important than the closed-form solution obtained by ad hoc regularization terms. It is well-known that for the vanilla GAN with closed-form equilibrium, we are not always ensured to get this equilibrium.\n3. The experimental results are also confusing for me, even contradictory to the introduction. In the introduction, the authors claim that \"in multi-modal generation Liu et al. (2021), the focus is on learning one or multiple modes within the data distribution.\". However, in the experiments, the authors verify that the proposed CCGAN is able to learn all the modes in the synthetic datasets.\n4. The verification is weak and not convincing for me. The comparing baselines are basically not designed for those experimental tasks. For example, COCO-GAN is designed for generating images, instead of image-to-image generation and super-resolution. By my understanding, the regularization in COCO-GAN is for allowing for generating by patches. If the authors wish to beat the COCO-GAN, metrics such as FIDs by generating patches should also be provided. Also for the super-resolution task, 30.43 dB is not generally a good PSNR. \n5. Why Theorem 3 proves that the CCGAN can avoid the mode collapse issue? The experimental results related to the mode collapse test are not convincing as well. The authors should present statistical results instead of illustrating several subjective results."
