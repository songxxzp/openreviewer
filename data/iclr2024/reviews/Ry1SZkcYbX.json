I would expect a significant improvement in efficiency/quality if the paper is to be accepted by a top-tier conference. \n\n- Sampling time comparison: I cannot get the key points from Table 1. Which is the proposed method (Edge32 w/ GP)? Looks like the original NeuS sampling is already the best. \n\n- Comparison with NGP: from Table 3 it looks like NGP is already fast and with high quality. This is also my major concern, different representations (MLP, NGP, K-planes, 3D Gaussians) would have very different sampling strategies, making the method hard or even impossible (e.g. 3D Gaussians) to apply to those representations. Also, powerful new representations would weaken the contribution (efficiency) of the paper.\n\n- The authors only conduct experiments on 4 DTU scenes, which is not convincing to me.\n\n- Too many equations in the paper. I would further simplify equations 1-8 as it is only a recap of previous works.\n\n- The writing of the paper could be further improved."

                "value": "This paper presents a new sampling technique called Edge-Sampler for efficient training of neural implicit surfaces in 3D reconstruction. Neural implicit surfaces, which use signed distance functions (SDFs), have shown improved geometry reconstruction compared to neural radiance fields (NeRFs). However, training SDFs is challenging and time-consuming due to the need for large sample counts to capture thin surface edges. The existing error-bounded sampling technique is effective but requires a large number of samples. The Edge-Sampler technique reduces the required sample counts by up to 10x while still preserving the error bound by reducing Riemann integral bias. It achieves this by using a double-sampling strategy to detect thin intervals of surface edges and fitting density functions with bounded CDF errors. The technique demonstrates superior results in terms of geometry reconstruction details, reduced sample counts and training time, and generalizability to different implicit SDF frameworks."

However, this assumption doesn't hold when the optimization process begins with an unknown underlying surface. This might result in slower convergence, particularly when the initialization is far from optimal. The manuscript does not currently acknowledge or address this limitation.\n\n-\tIncomplete manuscript\n  -\tThe evaluation of reconstruction accuracy is based on only four scenes from the DTU dataset. The selected results are only for Lambertian surfaces, while many prior works showcase results of specular surfaces of DTU dataset as well. Without insights into the results for the entire dataset, it's challenging to assess the performance comprehensively.\n  -\tThe choice of a single baseline (NeuS) for surface accuracy evaluation is limiting, ignoring the recent developments in surface reconstruction techniques, including but not limited to [Yariv et al, 2021] [Wang et al, 2022] [Fu et al, 2022] [Wang et al, 2023] [Li et al, 2023] [Li et al, 2023] [Li et al, 2023] and etc.\n  -\tWhile the manuscript claims improved efficiency, the speed comparison neglects the Occupancy Grid technique proposed in Instant NGP [Muller et al, 2022]. Furthermore, the proposed approach is slower than NeuS unless NeuS' interpolation technique is employed. Moreover, an important baseline is missing, which is the combination of the proposed network and NeuS.\n  -\tFigure 4 doesn\u2019t have captions.\n  -\tTable 3 time doesn\u2019t have units.\n\n-\tMismatch motivation and implementation\n  -\tThe manuscript contains a significant discrepancy between its stated motivation and its actual implementation. In the introduction, the manuscript emphasizes the advantages of the Laplace distribution as seen in VolSDF [Yariv et al, 2021] compared to other SDF-based rendering methods. However, in the methodology section, the proposed sampling approach appears to be predominantly focused on enhancing VolSDF. Surprisingly, in all the experiments, it appears that the approach utilizes NeuS' formulation instead. It is important to justify if this is the case and why so.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nYariv, L., Gu, J., Kasten, Y., & Lipman, Y. (2021). Volume rendering of neural implicit surfaces.
