                "value": "This paper delves into the realm of deep neural networks (DNNs), addressing a critical gap in understanding the interactions encoded by these models. Unlike existing interaction extraction methods, which lack theoretical guarantees for transferability, this work introduces a precise definition for the transferability of interaction primitives. Building on this foundation, the authors propose a novel method aimed at extracting interactions with maximal generalization power across different DNN architectures. Extensive experiments across language and image domains validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating enhanced generalization of extracted interactions.\n\nThis paper makes a significant stride in demystifying the interactions encoded by deep neural networks, introducing novel concepts and methodologies backed by solid experimental evidence. Addressing the highlighted weaknesses and questions will further fortify the paper's contributions, making it a valuable addition to the field of DNN interpretability."

To tackle this, Ren et al. (2023) established a series of theorems demonstrating that a DNN's inference score can be explained as a small set of interactions between input variables. However, these interactions lack generalizability and thus cannot be considered as faithful primitive patterns encoded by the DNN. To address this, the authors propose  a method to extract interactions that are common to different DNNs trained for the same task."

Although generalizability is critical in AI algorithms, especially when dealing with different tasks or data from different domains. However, the authors focus on explainable AI, and the generalizability is defined on different models of the same task, which does not align with the conventional understanding of DNN generalizability.\n- The proofs in the paper rely on two papers currently under review ([1,2] See appendix C). This poses a problem as the validity and peer-review status of these references are uncertain. Moreover, it would be beneficial for the readers if detailed derivations of Equation 11 were provided to better understand and verify the proofs.\n- While the paper provides a clear mathematical definition for generalizable interactions, it lacks a discussion on the existence of generalizable interactions. Moreover, the method proposed in the paper is derived heuristically using Occam's Razor principle instead of being grounded on mathematical theorems satisfying the definition. The paper does not satisfactorily address why this approach would yield generalizable interactions.\n- The experimental section of the paper only compares the proposed method with a single baseline. Including more baselines could strengthen the paper's persuasiveness.\n\n[1] Technical note: Defining and quantifying and-or interactions for faithful and concise explanation of dnns.\n\n[2] Where we have arrived in proving the emergence of sparse symbolic concepts in ai models."

Then it observes that such a composition could be ambiguous, and that it might not generalize to other models of the same data.  Then it proposes a framework for finding small and/or cohorts by optimizing for sparsity (eq 4), and further for maximizing sparsity while blending in another loss term that takes account sharing of variables in some way (eqs 5, 6).  Then it introduces a noising scheme (page 7) and proposes optimizing the search for cohorts in the presence of some level of noise.  Finally, the paper sets up experiments to search for such and/or cohorts within the behavior of a few large neural networks, examining extremely small subsets of the behavior of those network (reducing to 8-10 input variables), by manually selecting 8 patches within MNIST images of \"3\"s and 10 tokens for each set of inputs for SQuAD and SST-2 data sets, and examining the ability to find and/or cohorts that explain behavior of BERT, Llama, ResNet, etc.  It claims that with these methods it able to distinguish interactions that are shared between different models, and interactions that are in common."

                "value": "The paper does not refer to other work in examining shared features between networks, for example: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09346\n\nThe conclusions drawn from the paper are both noncommittal and unconvincing.  For example, the paper claims \"The sparsity and universal-matching property of interactions provide lots of evidence to faithfully explain DNNs with interactions.\"  However, the methods are considered over only tiny subsets of just 8 or 10 features, (e.g., explained in appendix G, just 8 hand-chosen patches of images of MNIST \"3\" digits, or just 10 words out of the hundreds for each example in the NLP data sets).  As a result, what is being explained with these methods cannot be claimed to be faithful to \"ResNet\" or \"BERT Large,\" but actually a very miniscule slice of the behavior of those huge networks.  The claim of faithfulness is not backed up empirically.\n\nThe methods are not clearly presented.  The main method comes down to Equation 6.  However most of the pages of the paper are spent on discussing Theorem 3, which is only tangentially related to the method and which does not clarify what the method actually does. For example, how continuous neural network features are discretized for the and-or analysis is not discussed at all.  How the search to optimize the discrete objective in Eq 6 is not discussed, and the level of sparsity, or the number of cohorts found in a typical solution is not revealed in concrete terms. If the goal is to clearly explain the method, it would be more helpful to move the tangential theorems to the appendix and spend more pages explaining equation 6 more precisely, with both concrete examples of how the interaction matrices are formatted, and concrete examples of how a search over cohorts would work in a specific small example.  Since runtime seems to be a major concern, it should be discussed. The size of the sets of features is small enough that it seems that a real-data example of how the method operates on a single example could be shown in detail.\n\nThe experiment results are very unclear, and it seems like it would be very difficult to reproduce the results given the information provided.  For example, in results in Fig 2 and 3 the y axis \"Interaction Strength\" is not explained other than that \"it is in log space\" or \"it is the ratio of shared interactions\".  What number is this this strength, and in what units? Beyond the lack of units, after the results are shown, they are not analyzed.  By analyzing the log-odds output of the ground-truth label, it looks like it is measuring faithfulness, but the plot captions claim a measurement of \"interaction strength\".  How interactions are being measured is not clear.  There is a very tiny 1/20 |I(s)|_max inside one of the plots that looks like a hint, but it is not explained.  Similarly, the units for Figure 4 are not explained.  All experiments are compared to a \"Traditional\" baseline which is not explained or summarized other than a reference to \n\nFigure 5 shows some qualitative differences, but it is not clear what conclusions should be drawn from the differences.  For example, it shows that a disjunction \"Ring just cold wet Seattle...\" etc is promoted from the \"Distinctive interactions\" column using Traditional methods to the \"Shared interactions\" column in the Our method.  Is this a success or is this a failure?  If there are two different ways of identifying the interactions, does the new way provide more insight?  Or are they just different? Figure 5 select \"some of the sailent\" interactions - is it cherry-picked?  What does it look like when not?"
