Only one example demonstrates the ability to combine multiple experts in Figure 9, and only three examples are shown for a single-expert combination. Most importantly, only four examples are used for quantitative experiments, which is insufficient to get solid conclusions.\n\n* The improvement is marginal for both VL and NLP tasks. From Table 1, we can find that MOLE cannot achieve the best text-alignment score for 2/4 cases and cannot achieve the best image-alignment score in the second row for 3/4 cases.

Particularly, each expert corresponds to adapting the pretrained model using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on a separate (subset of a) dataset. Unlike prior work that uses a simple addition of multiple LoRA modules or gradient-based methods for combining them, this work proposes a gating mechanism that computes weights for the modules based on the outputs from the pretrained model and each of the modules. Additionally, this work also proposes making the combination more fine-grained, with the mixture weights being layer or block specific in a transformer based model.\n\nExperiments in text-to-image generation and natural language inference (text-only) with 3-4 experts show that the proposed approach outperforms simple combination, and other methods comparable to simple combinations (SVDiff and LoRAHub)."

Particularly, it is claimed that the \"arithmetic operation-based fusion\" suffers from \"identity confusion among multiple LoRAs\". This issue needs to be clarified. How does the proposed approach fix this issue? Also, the details of the \"reference tuning-based fusion\" method are unclear. Is the approach from Gu et al., 2023 comparable to this work? If so, why is this approach not compared against them?\n- Training method: Section 3.5 says that only the gating parameters were trained, and the others were frozen. Does this mean the LoRA parameters were first individually trained and then kept frozen while the gating parameters were being trained? The current text implies that the LoRA parameters were never trained.\n- Experiments: How were the number of experts chosen for both the experiments?\n- Results: The results in Table 1 are unclear. What is the difference between LoRA expert 1 vs. expert 2 in the image alignment experiments? Is it the number of experts used? Why are these settings not shown for text alignment?\n\n\nThe experiments, especially the NLI ones, are limited and are not well-motivated.\n- Each of the experts is trained on one NLI dataset, and the mixture is evaluated on a mixture of NLI datasets. These are all essentially the same task. What are the experts expected to learn differently in these tasks? It would make more sense to build task specific experts and generalize to new tasks.\n- Moreover, the base model used is Flan-T5 which was already trained on all the NLI datasets used in this paper. It would make more sense to adapt the model to other datasets, or use a different base model."

It might be helpful to evaluate how much the performance varies based on the choice of the data used for training the gating function, and check whether the variance is lower for MoLE compared to baselines.\n- In Table 2, the labels under the \u201cModel\u201d column in the \u201cIn-Domain\u201d setting must be typos. Instead of MoLE^{r}, MoLE^{c} etc., these should be MoLE^{ar1}, MoLE^{ar2} etc. Can you please confirm?\n- In both image-generation and NLI experiments, the number of experts trained is between 3 and 5.
