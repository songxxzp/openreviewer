                "value": "As mentioned by the authors, the basic idea of using the sequence form to speed up column generation/double oracle for extensive-form games was proposed by Bosansky et al (2014). I do appreciate the authors' frank discussion of this comparison (Appendix A), but I think this should be reflected in the framing of the paper (e.g., perhaps Bosansky et al.'s method should be introduced in the body, and then the proposed DCG method should be framed as the natural analogue of that method for adversarial team games). I think the current framing of DCG makes it seem like it is more complex of a method than it really is. Phrased another way, in some sense I think Appendix A is the most important part of this paper from a conceptual standpoint, and it should be as much as possible moved into the body/discussed earlier, maybe even in the introduction. (if space is needed, for example, I'd suggest moving some of the ablation experiments, or the discussion of the BRO to the appendix; these matters are in my opinion less important than correct positioning of the work within past literature).\n\nFor the BRO, there should be some discussion of the total size of the representation (number of nonzeros in constraint matrix), as a function of e.g. the number of sequences, number of players, game size, etc. It seems to me that this size can be exponential in |H| in the worst case (when the number of players is large), which is somewhat troubling especially compared to past BROs which, as you say in Appendix A, do not have this problem. (For example, consider a polymatrix game with $N$ players and $A$ actions per player converted in the natural manner to extensive form---such a game would have $|H| = O((NA)^2)$ but every tuple of sequences will be relevant, so the  BRO will have representation size something like $A^N$).\n\nOn a more minor note, I would also like to see experiments on team-vs-team games, in which both teams would have to apply this column-generation method. In that setting, my guess would be the advantage over the baseline DAG algorithm will be less, because of the added inefficiency of having to perform CG for both sides---but I would still expect the method to perform very well."

Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework and how it compares to SOTA approaches for TMECor computation. The authors sufficiently discuss the novelty of their approach in the main body of the paper as well as in Appendix A. It is clear that their approach outperforms existing approaches in certain settings, and thus is a valuable contribution."

The role of the best response routine is to progressively expands the DAG representation.\n\nThe paper shows that this procedure does not worsen the theoretical bounds of the previous algorithms, and thoroughly evaluates different variants of the main algorithm on a large suite of games."

This property is not clear to me, and I thnk it should be better specified in the text\n* the BRO algorithm presented in Section 3.3 is not completely novel. A similar algorithm was provided in \"Subgame Solving in Adversarial Team Games\" by Zhang et al., with the similar purpose of providing a more sparse BR (in that case sparsity is useful for reaching fewer private states in the same public state).
