The key idea in their work is that exploration is required in on-policy reinforcement learning. When there is no exploration, certain states may fail to get explored and the policy might get trapped. In order to provide a remedy to this, algorithms typically use methods that do not depend on the frequency with which states are visited, which can provide suboptimal results compared to using simply using a method that incorporates details of frequency with which states are visited. As a remedy to this, the algorithm incorporates using a ReLU function to the advantage function. The way this is performed is that in the critic step, dropout is employed and in the actor step, ReLU is used. The motivation behind using the ReLU is that it enables a Bayesian inference over the actor's parameters. The rationale for the changes are justified in the Methods section. The work incorporates a theoretical bound that illustrates how their methods allows a maximization of estimation of state value functions plus a constant. The constant is then massaged in the spectral norm refinement stage of the algorithm. There are also very extensive empirical studies."
