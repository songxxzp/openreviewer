For instance, previous approaches generally consider directly predicting the neighborhood. However, given a generative diffusion model one might consider generating several neighborhoods, evaluating them, and selecting the best. Otherwise, you might also consider integrating optimization-based objectives in the diffusion model to guide the diffusion model towards generating better solutions. \n\nAdditionally, while the authors do evaluate many metrics, the performance difference between the proposed approach and previous work seems to be quite small and within the uncertainty intervals. It seems unclear that the proposed approach does improve over previous work but in the case that it generally does improve just within a small margin, you might consider evaluating win rate across instances or computing an average rank across instances to understand which algorithm generally solves the problem the fastest.\n\nThe problem instances also seem to be effectively solved quite quickly with the primal gap quickly reaching below 10-3. It would help to explain what level of primal gap is reasonable for these instances to be considered solved."

It seems that they all readily take the ILP formulation as input without much tuning (other than selecting the neighborhood size which is needed in this work as well).\nIn the same paragraph, it is not obvious why a data-driven approach is necessarily a better alternative as it assumes access to a distribution of problem instances and requires offline training. Here it might be helpful to give a high-level explanation of why learning-based methods should work well. \n\nIt would be helpful to explain why local branching is something we desire to learn, does it give performance guarantees for LNS? Does it empirically work well but is just too slow?\n\nAverage rank seems to be computed using the summary statistics. However, it might be informative to include a metric measuring the average rank that averages over problem instances. This would help give an idea of whether a given algorithm was generally solving problems faster overall. \n\nSmall errors:\n\n2nd paragraph\nHeuristics \u2026 is called \u2026 -> heuristics are called\n3rd paragraph\nHand-craft destroy -> hand-crafted destroy\nP3 local branching paragraph\n\u201cCan we\u201d -> delete this, or missing rest of sentence?"

Large neighborhood primal heuristics can be used to quickly find high-quality solutions to ILPs using commercial ILP solvers. They do so by iteratively destroying (using a destroy heuristic) and repairing (using the ILP solver) a given starting solution. In recent years, a number of machine learning approaches have been proposed that aim to learn good destroy heuristics. The proposed method builds upon earlier works (using the same model architecture, features, and data collection) but uses a diffusion-based learning scheme. The authors evaluate their approach on 4 problems and observe that it outperforms earlier approaches."

The authors only conduct one experiment that analyzes the effect of the number of diffusion steps. They report results for the values 5, 10, 20, 50 and find that 50 steps lead to the best results. This raises the question if the performance of the approach can be further improved by selecting an even higher number of steps. Overall, the relationship between number of diffusion step, prediction time, and prediction quality could be explored further. Fig. 4, which shows the results for the existing experiments, is also a bit difficult to read. Furthermore, the influence of other hyperparameters (e.g., destroy size) could be evaluated further.\n- The novelty of the paper is very slightly limited by the fact that the authors use the same model architecture, features, data collection etc. as earlier work. The main contribution of the authors is that they replace the imitation/contrastive learning approach of earlier works with a diffusion-based approach.\n- The quality of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 could be improved. For example, by using the same font for all Figures. Both figures are also not mentioned or explained in the text. For Fig. 2 it is not clear what elements are added and why only x_1 and x_n are considered on the right hand side (and not x_2, x_3, \u2026). \n- It is not clear based on which (near-)optimal values the primal gap is calculated. Ideally, the authors would also report the primal bound in the Appendix to make comparisons for future works easier.\n- There are some minor spelling mistakes etc. (LSN instead of LNS (page 2), Arechitecture (Fig. 2), unnecessary comma at the end of the baselines paragraph. etc)."

Related to the previous point, It would be good to report the ML inference time overhead during testing.

For LB-RELAX there seems to be quite a huge difference. From my own experience, sometimes it is due to different software versions (like SCIP or Gurobi). The other time it might be due to hardware differences: a slower machine computes different heuristics at the BnB nodes and thus produces different results if the wall-clock time budget is fixed.\n\n2. Difusco-LNS also takes advantage of multiple good solutions following previous work. I wonder if a contrastive learning component can be built into the diffusion model so that you can leverage bad solutions from LB?\n\n3. I realize the green curve in Figure 4 has an increasing trend at around 500-600 seconds. What happens there?\n\n4. From the ablation studies, it seems that DIFUSCO-LNS is sensitive to a couple of hyperparameters. I wish to understand whether you need to fine-tune them for different benchmarks."
