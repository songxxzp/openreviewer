Unsupervised Training: Two mixed audio recordings are combined, and the separation network aims to reconstruct each original mixture.\nWeakly-supervised \n2. Weakly-supervised Audio-language Training: Here again, two mixed audios are combined. The goal is to separate each individual source present in both mixtures. This is achieved with the bi-modal contrastive loss and a reconstruction loss. The bi-modal contrastive loss is employed to enhance the similarity between the predicted single source and its corresponding language prompt. The reconstruction loss, mirroring the unsupervised training, aims to reconstruct the original individual mixture prior to combining.\nThe paper provides comprehensive experiments, demonstrating that the proposed method surpasses baseline methods in performance."

The approach leverages CLAP embeddings to enforce semantic consistency in the separation results, even when individual source tracks are not explicitly provided but merged within the data.\n\nThe proposed model comprises three key components:\n\n1. Mix-Separation Paradigm: This component creates separation datasets from weakly-labeled noisy data, where more than one source is present in a single audio clip.\n\n2. CLAP Embeddings: The model employs CLAP, a joint embedding of text and audio modalities, to establish a constraint that ensures the separation results align with the same semantic characteristics, primarily focusing on timbre. This constraint is enforced through the CLIPLoss between the separation audio embeddings and the associated single-source text embeddings (e.g., 'This is the sound of [class]').\n\n3. Training: The entire separation model is trained by integrating the above two components with corresponding loss functions.\n\nThe experimental results demonstrate that the incorporation of CLAP embeddings significantly enhances separation performance by making the model sensitive to mixed and overlapping events in the data, ultimately leading to superior separation outcomes."

It ingeniously employs CLAP to establish a method for validating the consistency of separation outputs, integrating loss objectives that effectively converge both intermediate semantic consistency and separation content accuracy. Furthermore, it extends this innovative approach into a semi-supervised learning framework, broadening the potential applications of the data.\n\nThe paper demonstrates a robust and comprehensive experimental performance evaluation.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I assigned a 'weak reject' score to this paper due to what I consider to be a critical issue in the design of the separation pipeline and an empirical problem in the experimental results.\n\nFirstly, the paper introduces the utilization of CLAP embeddings as a constraint to enforce semantic similarity between the separation output and the source constraint. While this is a technically novel approach, it raises two important concerns:\n\n(1) The use of CLAP, or similar contrastive learning models, to enforce semantic similarity is not as solid as it appears. This is because CLAP is also trained with the same noisy, weakly-labeled data. When the paper uses prompts like '[this is the sound of flute],' these prompts have been trained on audio clips that contain more than just flute sounds, potentially including piano and guitar sounds. Therefore, the data used in the current setting for training this proposed separation model, is exactly the data that CLAP was trained on (and even more). This raises questions about whether the constraint effectively operates as intended, especially in cases where the separation sample contains multiple sources, one of which is the target source. To ascertain the true effectiveness of CLAP as an exclusive text embedding, further experiments are necessary.\n\n(2) The semantic alignment is a fancy phrase but in this audio separation case, primarily restricts the timbre of the audio rather than aligning the semantic content. While a high CLAP score indicates similarity in timbre, it doesn't guarantee similarity in content. Semantic alignment comes more in the case when the text itself contains different arrangement and logics. However, here the model only uses one or two single prompt such as [this is the mixture/sound of [class]]. A worth-noting question to ask is: why not use a timbre classier to verify it? You can send the separation result to an audio classification model to force the output to be in one timbre. Or a more direct question is: did you try this as an ablation study to show that using CLAP to align the semantic similarity is better than training a timbre classifier to enhance the separation results? I think this ablation study is a good point to show the technical solid of this paper. Such an ablation study would strengthen the paper's technical foundation without compromising its flexibility. Because for every data trained in this pipeline, you should at least know the source type to make the prompt text. A timbre classifier seems can be trained in a fixed (but large) candidacy slot.\n\nFrom another perspective, the paper presents a substantial number of experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the separation results. The appendix is comprehensive and aids in clarifying various aspects. However, the experimental results on the MUSIC dataset, achieving an SDR performance of 7.9 and 9.9 under the semi-supervised learning paradigm, do not significantly outperform the results in the recent LASSNet paper [1] (9.75 dB and 10.45 dB). While I acknowledge that both papers were produced during the same time period, this raises concerns about the necessity of CLAP as an embedding for enforcing semantic similarity. It prompts a reconsideration of whether CLAP could be superseded by a simpler text- or audio-query model with CLAP or CLIP embeddings, but a different separation design that doesn't require semantic similarity.\n\nBesides, any listenable demo for this paper? It would be beneficial to provide a demo page to assess the performance of the separation and we might see more interesting findings, such as how CLAP is trying to enhance the separation result. \n\nIn light of these concerns, I eagerly anticipate the authors' response to address these questions. Until it can be convincingly demonstrated that CLAP is a crucial element in enhancing performance or that it offers greater functionality than a single classifier constraint, I believe this paper may fall slightly below the acceptance threshold for ICLR.\n\n\n[1] Separate Anything You Describe, Arxiv."

For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which. \n\n2. Building upon my previous argument, I think that when one is using these large pre-trained networks on single-source data like CLAP, the underlying method becomes supervised in a sense, or to put it more specifically supervised with unpaired data. The authors should clearly explain these differences throughout the manuscript.\n\n3. I think the authors should include stronger text-based sound separation baselines like the model and ideally the training method that uses heterogeneous conditions to train the separation model in [A] which has already shown to outperform LASS-Net (Liu et. al 2022) which is almost always the best performing baseline in this paper.\n\nI would be more than happy to increase my score if all the above weaknesses are addressed by the authors. \n\n[A] Tzinis, E., Wichern, G., Smaragdis, P. and Le Roux, J., 2023, June.
