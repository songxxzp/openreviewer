The article introduces three metrizable conditions: direction optimality (evaluating the gradient between two distributions), separability (examining the distinctness between two distributions), and injectivity (measuring the metric as a distance). These conditions aim to provide clarity on the underlying motivation. Furthermore, the article includes a theoretical proof and introduces a new loss function and a normalized linear layer. These enhancements are designed to boost the discriminative capability of the discriminator and enable the generation of diverse, high-fidelity samples from the generator."

The article proposes three metrizable conditions, namely direction optimality (evaluating the gradient between two distributions), separability (evaluating disjointedness), and injectivity (measuring the metric as a distance).\n\nAdditionally, the article provides both theoretical and empirical evidence to demonstrate that only Wasserstein GANs fulfill these conditions. To enhance the discriminative capability of the discriminator and facilitate the generation of diverse, high-fidelity samples from the generator, the authors introduce a new loss function and a normalized linear layer. This normalized linear layer serves as a plug-in component that can be seamlessly incorporated into various GAN models.\n\nIn experimental evaluations, the SAN model achieves the best FID score when compared to numerous GAN baseline models."

                "value": "I have read the paper carefully, so i want the author to clarify the questions as follows:\n\nIf the author can clarify the following questions well, I'd like to raise my rating score.\n\n1. If I understand correctly, \"direction optimality\" implies that a negative gradient of the metric between the generated distribution and the target distribution , which guides the generated distribution toward the target. \"Separability\" pertains to two disjointed distributions, and \"injectivity\" suggests that the metric between the generated and target distributions is a distance. Is this interpretation accurate?\n\n2. Could you clarify the symbol \"$*$\" in Table 1?\n\n\n3. I recommend that when the article first mentions metrizable conditions, namely, direction optimality, separability, and injectivity, it would be more reader-friendly to provide an intuitive understanding of these terms and indicate which paragraphs explain these definitions. This would help readers quickly grasp the key concepts before delving into the detailed explanations.\n\n4. I have a question about the statement as follows:\nmost existing GANs besides Wasserstein GAN do not satisfy direction optimality with the maximizer $w$ of $\\mathcal{V}$. Although most existing GANs do not  satisfy direction optimality proposed in the article, but the discriminator of these gans actually provides the generator with gradients that make its distribution close to the target distribution which has been discussed in other articles[1-5]. What do you think about this question?\n\n\n\n5. There might be an error in the symbol  $g\\# $     $=\\sigma(g^{-1}(B))$. \n\nThe function $g$ is defined as $g: Z \\rightarrow X$, so the inverse function $g^{-1}$ should be $g^{-1}: X \\rightarrow Z$. The term $\\sigma(\\cdot) \\in \\mathcal{P}(Z)$. However, $g\\#$ \n\nis meant to represent the generator $g: Z \\rightarrow X$. Thus, there appears to be a discrepancy.\n\n\n6. I recommend that the author provide a clear explanation of why Equation (16) satisfies Theorem 5.3. I find it somewhat confusing and would appreciate a more comprehensible clarification.\n\n7. I have reviewed the code in the supplementary materials. There is a discrepancy between the code provided in Listing 2 (SAN discriminator) and lines 92-96 in the file \"STYLESAN-XL/pg_modules/san_mondules.py/SANConv2d.\" To ensure accuracy, please verify which version is the correct one.\n8. Should the SAN be trained from scratch, or can it be fine-tuned, especially in the last layer, using the Eq.16 loss function?\n\n9. I find it quite confusing to understand the importance of the three conditions in your theorem 5.3. In my opinion, direction optimality should be the most important condition, while the separability and injectivity conditions may not carry the same weight. This is because metrics used in GANs, such as f-divergences or IPM functions, inherently satisfy the distance property. Maintaining the separability condition becomes increasingly challenging as GAN training progresses and the generated distribution approaches the real data distribution.\nTherefore, I recommend that the author clearly outline the relationships and significance of all three conditions to provide a better understanding.\n\n\n1.Variational inference via Wasserstein gradient flows\n\n2.Variational Wasserstein gradient flow\n\n3.Deep Generative Learning via Variational Gradient Flow\n\n4.A Framework of Composite Functional Gradient\nMethods for Generative Adversarial Models\n\n5.Gradient Layer: Enhancing the Convergence of Adversarial Training for Generative Models"

Initially, they establish a connection between the Wasserstein distance and the Functional Mean Divergence (FM*). Then the Separability is proposed to link FM* to the maximum Average Sliced Wasserstein (max-ASW) distance. Subsequently, they introduce the injectivity for the design of effective discriminators. They examine commonly used GAN frameworks, including Wasserstein GAN and other losses GANs, and find that most GAN architectures, including those using Hinge-loss, Saturating, and Non-Saturating loss functions, typically do not fulfill the criterion of directional optimality. In response to this, the authors propose a straightforward modification to enhance this property within these GANs. To substantiate their theoretical claims, they conduct experiments that demonstrate the significance of these three properties. They also apply their modifications to contemporary models such as DCGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN-XL. The results affirm that their simple yet effective alterations lead to improvements over the baseline performance, thereby confirming the practical value of their theoretical insights."
