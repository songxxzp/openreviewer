Here, the privacy model is as follows. At each time step T, there are K arms. Each arm has a potential reward x_{t, k}. The algorithm is DP if, changing only one of the x_{t, k} causes the trajectory of arms that are selected to satisfy the usual eps-DP property.\n\nThe authors prove tight upper and lower bounds for this problem. In particular, they determine a parameter, similar to the parameter in the non-private setting, which essentially governs the error rate of the algorithm."

Meanwhile, in line 14, it seems there are a total of $T'/Ms_p$ arm pulls, with each pull randomly choosing an arm from $A_p$. \n  - Can the authors provide some high-level intuition behind the choice of $g_i$ and $h_i$ as described in equations (5) and (6)?"
