I summarize some detailed suggestions below. \n1) The experiments follow the base-to-new setting in CoCoOp. However, the base-to-new setting is more about generalization ability. Besides, the performance of the base-to-new setting is very sensitive to the hyperparamers, especially for epochs. It is because the performance of this setting requires a balance between alignment and generalization, which can be achieved by reducing the epochs.  When tuning the training epochs of CoOp, it will also achieve good performance. It is suggested to use the few-shot learning setting in CLIP and CoOp, which is more fair and supportive to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. \n2) The main idea of this paper is to explore how to assign multiple prompts to one class. PLOT also shares similar targets to leverage multiple prompts (ProDA is similar too). Thus, it is much better to employ these methods as the main baselines for comparison, instead of CoCoOp which targets generalization. It is suggested to compare with PLOT and ProDA in the few-shot setting.  It is better to add a discussion about the difference between the proposed method and them. \n3) What are your prompts for GPT-3 to generate prototypes?  Is the model robust for different generations?\n4) There are a series of methods for the class-wise LLM-generated prompts, such as [1-2]. It is suggested to add some discussions and comparisons with these methods. \n [1] Menon, Sachit, and Carl Vondrick. \"Visual Classification via Description from Large Language Models.\" ICLR 2023.\n [2] Pratt S, Covert I, Liu R, et al.

I think the authors should more explicitly describe it. My understanding is that training-free = 50 prototypes only (the second row in Table 4). Correct me if I am wrong.\n    - The description of the training process is also vague. Section 4 omits details on how prototype features are fine-tuned.

It is unclear if this method can work with different CLIP variants, open-sourced CLIP replication or other VLM models. I'm curious if changing the model architecture, training data, or VLM format would yield different results.\n    - While the method appears to be general, I'm concerned about it potentially \"overfitting\" to a specific model and dataset.\n- How does the training process for cross-dataset transfer work? When training on the source data (e.g., ImageNet), the model learns prototype features for ImageNet classes and adaptive attention weights for them. How does this transfer to target datasets where prototypes and attention weights remain untouched during fine-tuning?\n- Could you clarify the importance of the quality of prompts used in the experiments? What would happen if we used GPT-4 to generate the prompts? How does the quality of the input prompt to the GPT model impact the final performance?\n- Although the authors claim that fine-tuning the prompt textual features does not lead to overfitting issues, there are no ablations on the performance of training with frozen prototype features to demonstrate whether fine-tuning the prototype is necessary.\n- In Equation 7, the authors selected a method that can balance between all prototypes and the closest prototypes. Are there other balancing methods, such as using the Boltzmann operator or logsumexp, that could be considered?\n- While the authors aim for diverse prompts, it might be interesting to fix the prototype and only train the attention weights and forcing the attention weights to be a multinomial distribution with low entropy. This would be essentially learning to select the best prototype. It would be interesting to see if GPT-3 can produce a better single prompt than the hand-designed prompts used in CLIP.\n- Have the authors attempted to use the embedding ensembling method used in CLIP?\n\n\nMinors:\n-  In Equation 7, stating the \"average cosine similarity\" is not entirely accurate because the cosine similarities are weighted by the attention weights.\n-  While the trend in Figure 5 is clear, it could be valuable to include settings with 0/1 and 1/0 to further illustrate the findings.\n\nJustification:\nIn terms of performance, this paper demonstrates strength, and I commend the authors for their straightforward yet valuable concepts. Nonetheless, there are various intriguing aspects that remain unaddressed, leaving certain concerns. Additionally, the authors have made claims about the CLIP paper that may not be accurate."
