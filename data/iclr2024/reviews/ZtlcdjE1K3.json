                "value": "PTQ (Post-Training Quantization) is a technique that exports a pre-trained full precision neural network into low-bit. It is a promising way to reduce size of neural networks and costs of inference. However, PTQ can cause accuracy degradation with extremely low-bit settings. To solve this problem, the paper proposes two methods that are for improving PTQ process. \n\nIn the quantization process, weight parameters of a target network are quantized before inference. The paper tackles that there isn\u2019t any previous work that focuses on how to quantize weight parameters better. With a simple yet clear experiment, the paper shows that decoupling quant step and dequant step, and fine-tuning dequant step only lead to performance gain. In addition, the paper points out that outlier activation values that are clipped out after quantization affect performance a lot. To utilize these outlier values, the paper proposes OMR (Outlier-Migrated Reconstruction) that adds several channels to filters and operates them with outlier values which are shifted into safe clipping ranges. It has the same effect as increasing the number of bits.\n\nThe paper surpasses other previous works only with the decoupling quant step and dequant step. In addition, with OMR, the paper shows that higher accuracy can be obtained by sacrificing efficiency."

The authors identify two key obstacles to overcoming the performance drop of PTQ in extremely low-bit settings: (i) Separate quantization step-size scale factors for weight tensor. The authors propose a method called DOMR, which decouples the scale factors of weights at quant/dequant processes, considering the fact that integer weights can be obtained early in the process before actual deployment. (ii) Handling outliers: Most existing methods ignore outliers in model activations that fall outside the clipping range, particularly in lightweight models and low-bit settings. The authors introduce a technique called Outlier-Migrated Reconstruction to save outliers within a pre-defined bitwidth. The experimental results demonstrate that DOMR outperforms existing methods and establishes a new state-of-the-art approach in PTQ. Specifically, it achieves a 12.93% improvement in Top-1 accuracy for the W2A2 configuration on MobileNet-v2. The authors also mention that they will release the code associated with their work, which is rather important considering the complexity of the proposed method."

It's crucial for the authors to provide clear explanations and definitions for these lower and upper bounds of weights and activations.\n- The authors base their Outlier-Migrated Reconstruction (OMR) method on the assumption that the activation function is ReLU. However, it's essential to discuss the applicability of OMR to models that use non-ReLU functions. For instance, MobileNetV3 employs h-swish, and ViT utilizes GeLU. A more comprehensive discussion about the adaptability of OMR to such activation functions would enhance the paper's coverage. \n- The paper mentions that OMR involves duplicating channels for both weights and activations. This duplication may introduce additional computational overhead, but the paper lacks an in-depth analysis of this aspect. Providing a more detailed examination of the computational costs could be better. \n- The inclusion of an overall cost breakdown in Table 11 is appreciated. However, it would be even more informative if the authors could provide a specific breakdown of the runtime costs associated with Quant Time in the Fake Quantization process. This would offer a more granular view of the computational expenses involved in the proposed method, contributing to a deeper understanding of its practical implications."
