Experimental data demonstrates that SAF can significantly reduce training time and memory usage with little to no loss in accuracy. Additionally, it is shown that SAF-trained parameters can be used for inference in SNNs composed of LIF neurons."

For instance, in the section Spike Representation, the intermediate steps of most equations are omitted. And $\\mathbf{x}$ lacks explanation.\n2. What is the purpose of section 2.4.3. The network structure that included in this paper and OTTT do not have feedback connection.\n3. Merely validating the consistency between theoretical reasoning and the experimental results on CIFAR10 is insufficient for the author's purpose. It is evident that the author's approach, despite claiming consistency in the computation of reverse gradients with OTTT, yields different training outcomes (accuracy and fire rate). Moreover, based on the results presented by the author, it is clear that the SNN trained using the SAF method outperforms the OTTT method. Since the OTTT method involves more complex datasets, the author needs to demonstrate the superiority of SAF on those datasets as well.\n4. The author mentions that Equation 2 holds true strictly when the network time step T tends to infinity. However, in practice, the author uses relatively small values of T, which introduces errors between the actual spike accumulation of the SNN and the weighted spike accumulation. These errors arise due to the uneven distribution of spikes[1]. Could the author provide insights on the differences between the training results (using representation) and the actual LIF forward results to address this issue?\n\n[1] Bu T, Fang W, Ding J, et al.
