            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The main weaknesses I see in the approach are:\n1. Integrating over multiple timesteps breaks the markov assumption from which the learning objective in Eq. 8 is derived. This is because, given the multi-state parametrization, a state s_t depends on more than s_{t-1}. This is true not only for the proposed approach but also more generally for every method that introduces a dependency between states (e.g. smoothing). Previous work even noticed that such smoothing can hurt performance (see Smith et al., A Walk in the Park: Learning to Walk in 20 Minutes With Model-Free Reinforcement Learning).\n2. The dependence on a hand-picked segment length K. While having some parts of the algorithm heuristically tuned is generally not a problem, I find this parameter to possibly be challenging to pick (due to its dependence on the task) and time-varying. My intuition is that the problem does not appear in the selected experiments due to their simplicity. I guess it will be much more challenging as soon as the time derivative of the reward drastically changes over time.  A cue in this direction is the failure case on the table tennis task, which shows these characteristics (when the ball is close to the end-effector, the robot needs very high-resolution updates, while a longer horizon is sufficient in the waiting times. This problem is not unusual in most robot tasks: for example, in visual navigation or locomotion, the interdependence between states is rarely constant (e.g., when a sudden obstacle appears, one needs to react fast). I think the paper would benefit from studying this aspect in more detail. Could there be a connection between the derivative of the value function and the segment length K? Can it be learned with the task? \n\nA second limitation is in the experimental setup. Specifically:\na) I find some of the results to be difficult to interpret. In Fig. 6b-c, all methods appear to perform similarly in the dense and sparse setting, which I find surprising. Even more so, almost all approaches (including gSDE, which achieves the best performance) perform better with sparse rewards than dense ones. Why is this case? At least for step-wise methods, dense should do better. Why does this happen? \nb) I think that results should be reported for a longer number of interactions. In Fig. 5,6, and 7, the methods do not appear to be fully converged. Showing results up to convergence (as in Fig. 5a) would give a better intuition about the approach's strength in comparison to the baselines.\n\nOther relatively minor limitations:\n1. The baselines are not defined (e.g., what paper is BBRL?)\n2. The comparison of trajectory-based to state-based is not entirely apple to apple since the trajectory methods require an extra low-level controller, possibly specifically tuned to the robot/task. Their data efficiency could be attributed to this prior. In addition, such a low-level controller is difficult to get in some cases, and a simple PD controller won't do (e.g., locomotion). I would mention this disclaimer to the experimental setup.\n3. There is a typo in Eq. 5."

A more fitting term, such as \u201csub-trajectory based RL,\u201d may better capture the essence of the work.\n2. The paper would benefit from a more organized exposition of its contributions. It appears that applying policy gradient to segments is the primary novel component. And this work integrates techniques from Li et al. (2023) and Otto et al. (2021). A clearer differentiation from these prior works would enhance the clarity of the paper.\n3. While hyperparameters are listed in the appendix, the rationale behind their selection remains opaque. Expanding on this would add depth to the methodology.\n4. I feel that the current experimental setup does not sufficiently justify certain design choices. Consider incorporating ablation studies to address the following:  \n    a. The necessity of the differentiable policy projection, as compared to alternatives like those used in PPO.  \n    b.

To overcome these problems, the authors provide the Temporally-Correlated Episodic RL (TCE) technique. By sampling multi-second trajectories in a parameterized space, TCE improves exploration efficiency and ensures high-order trajectory smoothness and movement correlation capture.

Many terms in the paper are described with words, which makes it hard to understand. I strongly suggest the authors provide mathematical definitions. For example, \n\n- a. Since this is still an RL approach, define the Markov Decision Process first. What is the action space? What is the state space? Now you can explain how your approach differs from traditional RL more clearly, by providing us the details in this different MDP. A tricky question here is that since MDP is Markovian, why do you need the temporal correlation?\n\n- b. It would be more helpful to define the dimensions of $y$, $w$, $\\Sigma$ and $s$.\n\n- c. What are d_mean and d_cov in Equation (4)? Are they Frobenius distances?\n\n3. As a reader, I feel many unimportant texts are taking too many places, which makes it not easy to understand the paper. For example, Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.4 don't need so many places to mention, since they are merely (a) complete-trajectory sampling, (b) GAE, and (c) TRPO-like. Instead, providing the pseudo-code for the whole learning process would be more valuable as a complement to Figure 3. Currently, there are too many technical things and curves in Figure 3, which makes it hard to understand the learning procedure from this single figure.\n\n4. The result is not sufficient to show the significance of the proposed method. In particular,\n\n- a. After checking Appendix C.2, I found that the baselines perform generally well when TCE works well. However, there exist some situations where TCE significantly fails and the other baselines still work well, and these situations are not rare, including LeverPull, StickPull, Hammer, ButtonPressTopdown, and ButtonPressTopdownWall. \n\n- b. Furthermore, the curves for SAC and PINK are terminated after 10M and 27M interactions respectively, whereas the other methods terminate at 50M interactions, which is an unfair comparison. It is hard to show the efficiency of this algorithm unless these baselines are finished. The reason is: in many cases, these baselines would raise their success rates nonlinearly during the training process, and we cannot conclude by only inspecting their intermediate performances.\n\n- c. Several key ablation studies are missing to test the soundness of each proposed component. See the questions.\n\nFinally, there are some typos in the paper. For example, in Equation 5, the left curly brace is missing. In Equation 6, the (|s) looks strange, it might be (s) instead."

Why cannot SAC and PINK be deployed to parallel training? (Also, 'fewer' samples, not 'less' samples).\n\n5. In terms of the ablation studies:\n\n- a. The PPO and SAC in this paper are only used to generate low-level actions. However, both of them are general RL frameworks, which should also be applicable even if the action space is changed to the parameter space of the trajectory. And these versions in the parameter space of trajectory are missing as the baselines. You can still claim that these new baselines are just some naive version of TCE since they do not really calculate per-segment credit assignment and there's no exact probability calculation. But, showing how these frameworks work in this new parameter space is still important, since now we can evaluate how this different action space could improve the sample efficiency by itself.\n\n- b. Smoothness comparison. Define a metric for smoothness, and evaluate how all the final trajectories for all the methods perform under this metric. Since you claim that TCE helps the smoothness, then only showing the success rate is not sufficient.\n\n- c. The significance of the exact probability calculation. If you abandon this component and just use the normal p(w) instead of p(y), how would the performance change empirically? \n\n- d. One thing I am wondering is how this temporal correlation helps the sampling complexity. Can you provide the final Sigma for each DoF? Ideally, this matrix should be far from the diagonal matrix, otherwise, we can just use the step-wise algorithm."
