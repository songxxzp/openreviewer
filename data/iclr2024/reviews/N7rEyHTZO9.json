The authors did not introduce the details of the operation clearly and faired to convince me the advantage of the newly proposed SSC layer. In my point of view, the proposed method is just a special case of convolution and the authors just slectively weighted sum the input features follow a hand-crafted rule. \n2) The experimental results of this paper is not strong enough to support the authors arguements. The authors argue that the proposed SSC layer is a good replacement over convolution operations, however, they did not validate the proposed method on sufficient network architectures. For example, the authors should validate the proposed method on large scale image classification tasks and validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on classical backbones. \n3) The improvement over the existing methods is not significant. Based on the reported experimental results, the speed and memory improvement is minor and the SSC layer will lead to performance drop over the convolution layers. \nTo sum up, the authors should re-write the paper and try to introduce their motivation and detailed operation clearly. Furthermore, the authors need to validate their contributions on more main stream backbones."

Experiments are only done on small scale datasets such as cifar100. Yet, conclusions on small scale datasets does not necessarily lead to a generalization to large scale datasets.\n\n4. According to the experimental results, the training and inference speed of the proposed SSC is not significantly improved but the accuracy of the network is adversely affected even if on the small-scale dataset cifar100.
