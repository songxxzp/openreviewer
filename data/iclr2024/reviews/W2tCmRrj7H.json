                "value": "W1. While the model showcases empirical strength, discussions or case studies on how it might be applied in real-world healthcare settings would enhance its practical value. The paper lacks an important motivation beyond patient privacy on why generating synthetic EHR is useful in practice. Providing this motivation is essential for the paper to be useful in the healthcare setting and should not be high-level only and be supported by experiments. For example, is this useful for data augmentation? If so does having data augmentation provided by this paper\u2019s model improve downstream prediction tasks? And other questions in a similar vain.\n\nW2. It would be beneficial to understand the model's performance across diverse EHR datasets to gauge its broad applicability. \n\nW3. One big challenge in generating synthetic data for EHR is the heterogeneity of the data with respect to specific groups (based on e.g. gender, age, race, etc). The paper is missing this analyses completely as it would benefit the validity of the generated data. Without identifying these spurious correlations, it is not at all clear where such fake patient data would be useful.\n\nW4. The paper combines various components, like optimal transport and diffusion models, which might make the model computationally intensive or challenging to implement.\n\nW5. The paper considers missingness in only static features or only temporal features. This is not a useful separation for missingness of modalities. Missingness in healthcare and specifically in EHR is not in this manner. Missingness is often not at random which in an on by itself provides information for prediction models (e.g. not doctors not ordering urine sample for a specific patient from a point onwards does not indicate missingness at random but rather urine sample is not required for the specific diagnosis that is being made). Additionally, missingness is not for the entire trajectory of the patient but rather at different points in time each covariate could either be missing or not and the method provided in this paper does not delve deep into these cases.\n\nW6. The paper does not handle irregular sampling property of the EHRs which is in fact more important for handling than the type of missingness handled in the paper.\n\nW7. The final results although beating the baselines, the uncertainty is large enough that the model\u2019s performance improvement relative to LDM, EHR-M-GAN is not significant."

                "value": "This paper presents a latent diffusion model for heterogeneous tabular EHR generation. More specifically, the method aims to generate static and temporal EHR data jointly while taking into account of the missing modalities of EHR data. The authors aim to capture intrinsic relationships between static and temporal data via a unified latent space and address missing modalities through an optimal transport problem in the embedding space. The model is evaluated against various baselines including VAE, GAN, and other diffusion models (DM). Their results show that their method outperforms other models in generation fidelity and utility."

                "value": "The main contributions of this paper include formalizing the problem of generating heterogeneous EHR data with missing modalities as well as the use of the optimal transport problem to solve this issue. It also discusses their latent space alignment, an important feature when dealing with missing modality data, in ample detail. The authors evaluate their results against multiple generation methods and uses data from the MIMIC-III and eICU database. The baselines include models of various architectures including VAEs, GANs, and other DMs. In addition, three areas of data evaluation are also considered, namely data fidelity, data utility, and data privacy. The paper presents their architecture in a clear manner that is easy to understand. There is also sufficient breadth covered in the Related Work section."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "In the Related Work section, the authors bring up TabDDPM as a recent model that addresses heterogeneous tabular generation. They claim that existing diffusion-based EHR models are either unable to \u201cgenerate categorical features or their tendency to treat numerical and categorical features independently.\u201d However, if I am not mistaken, TabDDPM combines multinomial and Gaussian losses which implies that it treats categorical and numerical features dependently. In addition, as the authors mentioned, TabDDPM was also applied to EHR generation (Ceritli et al., 2023). If there is no misunderstanding, then this paper\u2019s novelty lies in its approach of using a unified latent space to consider static and temporal correlations and dependencies (rather than being the first diffusion model to capture joint relationships). If this is the case, it was unclear as at first read, it could be misunderstood that the paper was also novel in capturing dependent relationships between static and temporal EHR amongst diffusion models. \n\nIt would also be helpful to clarify what feature dimensions (static and temporal) match to in the context of MIMIC-III and eICU in the Appendix. Even though a table is provided in the Appendix, the corresponding dimensionality is not the most clear. \n\nIn sections 4.1 and 4.2, the authors assume an individual patient EHR to take one of the three forms (all static features exclusively present, all temporal features exclusively present, or all features are present). However, in real EHR data, there are often patients with some (not all) static features present and some (not all) temporal features present. \nIn addition to designating p% and q% missing for static and temporal features, it would also help to see results from randomly sampling patients from the datasets to obtain a realistic distribution of missing data/modalities for training data (as to my knowledge, datasets such as MIMIC already have patients with missing measurements). \n\n\nSince addressing the problem of missing modality seems to be the primary goal of the paper, more experiments in general (perhaps showing more baselines other than EHR-M-GAN or other evaluation metrics/scores for fidelity and utility) would be helpful. Currently, only R-squared values are depicted for generation fidelity and only eICU for utility. More results in the Appendix would help support the claims. It would also be very helpful to include results from training on real data for Figures 2-4 to compare as it would provide more context. Currently, EHR-M-GAN is the only comparison. \n\nLastly, a couple of brief mentions of future work or limitations in the conclusion would also help clarify and reaffirm their current goals and progress. For example, addressing lower privacy scores or lack of ablation studies and their implications. \n\nSome minor edits found:\n\n- Section 4.1: First sentence \u201cwhere ___ contains time-invariant features\u201d should have \u201cS\u201d superscript for x instead of T? \n\n- Section 4.2: Second sentence \u201cembedding the patient information as ___\u201d should have \u201cS\u201d superscript for z instead of T?\n\n- Section 5.5: Second sentence \u201crandomly designate p% of samples as lacking temporal features\u201d should be \u201cstatic\u201d?"

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Table 1 is a bit confusing to read. There is no label for the temporal feature dimensions (d) for MIMIC-III in the table. Does that mean it is the same as eICU? Similarly, is the T for eICU also the same? \n\n- Is the paper also claiming novelty in joint static and temporal diffusion?\n\n- What about considering generating samples that include missing modalities? Should generating missing modalities also be a point of consideration in terms of data fidelity?"
