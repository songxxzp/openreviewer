This does not seem likely in the brain: the period of the gamma oscillation is tens of milliseconds, which certainly would not allow enough time, and even the theta oscillation seems to fast for this.

Some of my comments still apply to this version and are copied here verbatim from my previous review._\n\nThe paper focuses on Equilbrium Propagation (EP), i.e. a learning algorithm for neural networks that was introduced relatively recently and aspires to be more biologically plausible and more suitable for analog hardware than back-propagation (BP). The theoretical version of EP relies on an infinitesimal perturbation (which is not feasible to achieve in physical settings) and on symmetric weights (which are also unrealistic in biology and constrain hardware design). The paper aims to understand the impact of each of these two issues separately. It achieves to do so in the \"holomorphic EP\" (hEP) setting, i.e. under the assumption of complex-valued neurons. The authors achieve this by extending the theory of hEP to asymmetric connectivity, where they show that it is possible to obtain exact estimates of the gradient despite finite perturbations, therefore suggesting that the bigger issue is weight asymmetry. They then proceed to tackle the problem of asymmetry by introducing a loss term that penalizes it directly, and they show experimentally that this term improves the performance of hEP significantly in asymmetrically-initialized networks, in certain visual tasks using a 4-layer convolutional network."

More generally, the paper aims to contribute to an area that is of broad interest, as it relates to machine learning, neuromorphic engineering, and theoretical neuroscience. Furthermore, it truly advances the empirical results of the EP-related literature."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While this is obviously a valuable piece of work in certain respects, I believe it is also significantly limited in other key aspects.\n\nSignificance: The work ultimately aspires to improve aspects of backpropagation that are indeed important and relevant to multiple large disciplines (ML, neuromorphic hardware, neuroscience), however, concretely, the resulting contribution is very narrow. Namely, it improves the performance and the theoretical understanding of hEP somewhat, specifically in the case of asymmetric weights, but it doesn't resolve the problem of asymmetry completely, as can be seen in the performance comparison to symmetric weights (Table 2). Moreover, hEP is a specialized version of EP that makes additional assumptions for complex-valued networks, which limits the applicability and generality of the algorithm. Furthermore, EP itself more broadly is interesting but is a rather limited method in terms of achieving its goals of good performance, efficiency, useful hardware demonstrations, or deep learning, in comparison with other methods that have similar goals that have been more successful. Its biological compatibility could also be debated, given its requirement for multiple network-wide iterations before a weight update. Therefore, it could be argued that the significance of the results only relates to a very narrow subfield. Furthermore, the theoretical advance separating the impact of the finite nudge from that of the asymmetry in hEP is not trivial, but I wonder how useful it is to the ICLR community, beyond the very narrow sub-community that specializes in hEP. In the broader picture, and given the already existing better-working alternatives, the progress made here towards biological plausibility or neuromorphic computation seems small, in my view.\n\nNovelty: The main novelty of the paper is in the theoretical results, since the empirical fact that improving performance by dealing with asymmetric weights is not a new result. Nevertheless, I suspect that to someone with a good understanding of the earlier mathematical work that introduced hEP (Laborieux & Zenke, NeurIPS 2022) the new theoretical results might not be very surprising. However, it should be noted that I am not in a position to judge this fully. In any case, the insight from the theory is the impact of asymmetrical weights, relative to that of finite nudge, which seems to be also covered by the empirical result, therefore the added value from the theory in this case might not be substantial. Regarding the paper's empirical or practical contributions, some novelty exists in the objective function that penalizes asymmetries in the weight matrix. However, the novelty of this is limited because much older learning rules that achieve weight symmetry do exist (Kolen & Polak, IJCNN 1994; see also Payeur et al., Nat. Neurosci. 2021). In fact, these rules do not rely on global iterative equilibria, so the present paper's implementation of learnable weight symmetry could be characterized as a step-back in this regard. It should be recognize though that the new method is applicable when the connectivity is not reciprocal, whereas previous ones probably were not.\n\nContextualization in the literature: The paper does (now) cite some of the works that had similar aims, but only in passing, only in the discussion as opposed to the motivation section, discounts the better empirical results that the other works achieved, attributing this only to the lower simulation cost of the alternatives, and does not mention that some of these methods not only perform better in classification benchmarks, but also require fewer assumptions for compatibility with biology and for efficiency in learning hardware, e.g. by circumventing the need for backward passes of information completely.\nSome examples are: Payeur et al., Nat. Neurosci. 2021; Greedy et al., NeurIPS 2022; Mengye Ren et al., ICLR 2023; Journ\u00e9 et al., ICLR 2023.\n\nIt would be very helpful to the readers and the targeted research communities if the authors motivated their choice to focus specifically on EP as opposed to alternative methods that have similar goals, but don't have the same limitations. This could be a way to mitigate the weaknesses of the paper to some extent.\n\nTo be clear, some of the algorithm's limitations in comparison to alternatives are: reliance on complex-valued networks; constraints in network architecture and depth, expensive simulations for the equilibrium dynamics (e.g. a multi-GPU cluster was used according to the supplementary material, despite the small networks and simple tasks); questionable bio-plausibility of the necessity for equilibrium; hardware implementations of EP are mostly theoretical. To their credit, the authors have mentioned some of these limitations in the discussion. They also provided some solutions or counterarguments, however these are largely theoretical, vague, or speculative.\n\nAll in all, I believe that the work's value might be able to increase if the manuscript could explain its motivations and its contributions in a context broader than the EP literature. At present, this is not clear enough or supported well enough, in my view."

Could the authors please clarify, does any analog substrate achieve the relaxation \"for free\", or what are the requirements, more specifically? For example, the Kendall et al. reference seems to rely on a very peculiar and ad hoc hardware implementation.\n\nAlso, in the most efficient hypothetical hardware implementation, I suspect that \"for free\" is far from the truth, as, even there, the relaxation phase would include multiple weight updates, which consume power; in fact commonly more power than weight reads. Wouldn't alternative algorithms that do not have this relaxation phase be significantly more efficient? The provided references do not seem to disagree with this, so in which sense do the references support the \"free\" claim?\n\nI would appreciate the authors' insight in these questions."
