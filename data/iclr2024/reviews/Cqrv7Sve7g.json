Moreover, the presentation of the results does not consider statistical significance\n* No investigation is done to understand the impact of different choices in the algorithm\n\nThe TGR and UDS are presented too succinctly. If the reader is not familiar with these methods it is impossible to understand how they relate. For example \"UDS relabels unlabeled data with zero rewards\"  seems like a very strange way to deal with unlabeled data - it essentially doesn't deal with it. More details would be needed.\n\nThe paper proposes to \"learn a reward propagation graph and infer rewards\", yet a quick google search on \"reward propagation\" reveals a paper from 2020 that proposes a similar method to infer rewards on nodes with missing reward labels [1]. Although their method is for the online RL setting, it seems straightforward to use it in the offline RL setting. This would be an important baseline.\n\nThe empirical evaluation is not adequate from a scientific rigour point-of-view. Only 5 seeds are used and Table 1 highlights the score of methods for which the standard deviation intersects with other methods. This is misleading, only non-intersecting standard deviations should be highlighted. Perhaps additional seeds could help in this. \n\nVery little work is done to understand the impact of different components in the method. For example, what is the impact of using a reward propagation graph? Why not simply infer the reward through a classification/regression loss that takes as input only the current state. This is another important baseline. Finally what is the impact the different reward factors?"

Since $f_{\\theta}$ must learn the relative importance of each dimension in the node data, it raises the question of the necessary diversity within the annotated data. For instance, if all the annotated data consists of expert transitions with the highest rewards, it might be challenging for the function to discern which dimensions of the node data contribute most significantly to changes in reward. Hence, an important question to address is: \"What level of diversity within the annotated data is required for the proposed method to learn an effective function $f_{\\theta$?\"\n* Is the reward calculated by the graph method bounded by the range of rewards in the annotated data, i.e., $\\max{(R_U)}\\leq \\max{(R_L)}$? This question seeks to understand the extent to which the graph-based reward inference can maintain the upper bound of reward values, as derived from the annotated data.\n* To make the proposed method practically feasible, it's essential to investigate the computational cost requirements. Specifically, showing the computational time and memory consumption required for reward inference helps provide insights into the practical applicability and efficiency of the method in real-world scenarios."
