OLLSO leverages a distance-preserved autoencoder to transform the original high-dimensional input space into a continuous latent space, allowing for efficient optimization of utility functions. The paper provides a theoretical probabilistic safety guarantee from the latent space to the original space. In simulation experiments, OLLSO outperforms existing high-dimensional constrained optimization algorithms. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates OLLSO's real-world application in clinical experiments, where it efficiently and safely optimizes neuromodulation therapy for a paraplegic patient, showcasing its practical utility in safety-critical contexts. Overall, OLLSO offers a promising approach for addressing high-dimensional optimization problems while ensuring safety, with potential applications in various fields."

OLLSO's innovation comes from its utilization of a regularized autoencoder to transform complex, high-dimensional input spaces into continuous latent spaces while preserving distances, enabling efficient handling of hybrid inputs. The algorithm then employs an optimistic local safe strategy within the latent space, distinguishing safe regions through the upper confidence bounds of the safety function. Furthermore, the paper provides a rigorous theoretical probabilistic safety guarantee that spans from the latent space to the original input space. OLLSO's practicality is demonstrated through its application to safety-critical scenarios, where it outperforms existing high-dimensional constrained Bayesian optimization algorithms in terms of both optimization efficiency and safety during sampling. Its successful deployment in real clinical experiments, optimizing lower limb muscle control for a paraplegic patient, underscores OLLSO's potential for impactful real-world applications in safety-critical domains."

Besides, why does the real clinical therapy optimization in Section 6.1 satisfy the assumptions?\n- After Equation (1), I do not think $\\alpha$ smaller than 0.5 will make the solution safe. Maybe I misunderstand some things. In Algorithm 1, there is an extra half bracket in the line 9.\n- Even though the work is quite different from the safe exploration in RL [1], it would be great if the authors could have some discussion about their differences in terms of problem setting, safety mechanism, etc. The researchers in Safe RL would quite appreciate these discussions.\n\n[1] Yang Q, Sim\u00e3o T D, Jansen N, et al.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- __Probabilistic safety:__ Proposed as a novel concept, I find it confusing and believe it needs to be discussed further. \n\nSpecifically, we seek to find the optimal value $x^* = \\max f(x)$ under the condition that $x^*$ is safe, __probably__. Do we not observe whether $x^*$ is actually safe? Is the safety at $x^*$, or any other $x$ we have observed, stochastic? Since I have not completely understood this central aspect of the paper, I reserve judgement until it is further clarified, but the objective in Eq. 1 does not currently appear to be properly defined.\n\n- __Assumptions of unclear validity & subsequent theorem:__ \n  - __Assumption 1:__ While this is a common assumption, _it is conventionally made on the original input space_. Assuming that the VAE latent space adheres to this assumption would entail that the projections from $\\mathcal{Z}$ are sufficiently well-behaved. In vanilla BO, the modeling choices adhere to the assumption through the use of an appropriate kernel (Matern, RBF). However, it is not clear whether the decoding step is well-behaved (and due to its distortion of the space, I would be surprised if if was), so that _the assumption is adhered to_ in the proposed setup. I suggest the authors re-visit this assumption, since its correctness hinges on the continuity of the decoder. What makes them believe that the norm-bound $B$ is preserved through the decoding step? Since the theoretical analysis hinges on Assumption 1, which is decidedly _not_ common in latent space BO, the gap between the conventional assumption and the one made in latent space should be theoretically justified.  \n\n  - __Assumption 3:__ The mapping $U$ is not currently properly defined, since it does not have an output. I believe you mean that $U$ is a _matrix_ or a map $R^D --> R^{d_e}$ (as in HeSBO). Further, wouldn't $g(\\mathbf(x))$ imply that $g$ accepts D-dimensional input and $g(\\mathbf(Ux))$ imply that $g$ accepts $d_e$-dimensional input?\n  - __Subsequent subspace assumption (After A3, henceforth AA3):__ _\"Here we assume that the latent space mapping is an \u03b5-subspace mapping \"_. Please re-state this as a proper assumption for clarity. Moreover, is there a fundamental reason to believe this holds true, i.e. can properties of the IRVAE shed light on this? In HeSBO, the construction of the algorithm ensure this holds true. I don't see why the VAE would satisfy this unless it employed only linear layers (which I assume it does not).\n  - Lastly, the intermediary conclusion, _\"we can properly choose $\\beta_t$ that satisfies the probability safety guarantee, under the noise-free setting\"_ does not mesh well with __Assumption 2__ - observations are perturbed by noise.\n\nDue to the three (A1, A3, AA3) seemingly unverifiable and seemingly incorrect (A1, AA3) assumptions that are made, I do not attribute any value to the theory that is being presented. I encourage the authors to shed light on why these assumptions are valid. \n\n- __Novelty of method:__ OLLSO combines exisiting VAE architectures with trust regions, Thompson sampling and constaints. VAEs for BO have been extensively explored, and the other components are exactly SCBO (Eriksson and Poloczek 2021). While the combination is interesting, no novel building blocks for BO are proposed.\n\n- __Brief methodology section:__ Section 4. is brief and too high-level. Thus, it leaves a few questions unanswered. These are all outlined in the _Questions_ below. I believe addressing these would add clarity to the paper. Moreover, Section 4.2 is related work and should, in my opinion, be moved to Section 2. \n\n- __VAE-related background:__ BO and GPs are well-covered in the background, but the VAE-related design choices are not. As it is a vital part of the algorithm, background on the IRVAE is integral to the paper.\n\n- __Parsing of results:__ Plots are difficult to process due to the small fontsize, and text which overlaps with the rest of the plot (Fig. 4). Consider making it substantially larger, possibly at the expense of moving some of it to the Appendix.\n\n__Minor:__\n- _\"estimates both the posterior and the confidence interval\"_. The confidence interval comes for free after estimating the posterior, so saying that the posterior is estimated suffices.\n- _\"Follows the standard local Bayesian optimization algorithms ...\"_ --> Following\n- $u_t(z)$: If the $\\max C$ is over $z$ (which it should be) then  $u_t$ is not a function of $z$.\n- Fig. 1: Optimisticc --> Optimistic"

Though the discussion involves random-projection-based dimension reduction methods, it lacks direct comparison with the proposed IRVAE, especially when the assumption is shared. Specifically, HESBO [1] offers a comprehensive discussion of the feasibility of $\\epsilon$-subspace embedding and its impact on downstream uncertainty quantification when applying popular kernels. The recent follow-up work [2] further advances this direction by reducing the risk of losing global optimum in the embedding. A direct comparison could better motivate the proposed IRVAE, which lacks a similar theoretical guarantee and requires additional assumption 3 to proceed with the analysis.\n\n2. The related work part also misses a section dedicated to distance-preserving dimension reduction for uncertainty quantification, which is closely related and should have been compared to the proposed IRVAE. For example, [3] and [4] focus explicitly on distance preserving (feature collapse) in the latent space for uncertainty quantification. Additionally, a similar framework, BALLET [5], relying on superlevel-set identification on top of confidence bounds and deep kernel for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization, is missing in the discussion. There is potential for incorporating its regret analysis to enhance the significance of the proposed paper further.\n\n3. Given existing work in distance preserving dimension reduction, local optimization for efficient global optimization, and safe exploration for optimization with Gaussian processes, the general novelty of the proposed method is very limited.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Nayebi, Amin, Alexander Munteanu, and Matthias Poloczek. \"A framework for Bayesian optimization in embedded subspaces.\" In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 4752-4761.

                "value": "Overall, I appreciate the strong empirical studies of this paper. All experiments are based on very real-world application & that is great.\n\nHowever, I am also concerned that the algorithmic contribution of this paper is too incremental: if I understand this paper correctly, it comprises two separate phases (learning low-dim embedding & doing safe BO on the low-dim space) and each phase is a direct application of an existing algorithm. \n\nIn addition, I am also not sure what the current theoretical analysis implies. I understand that Theorem 1 is established to translate a probabilistic constraint on the latent space to another on the original space. \n\nIt seems the math suggest a translation on the UCB of the safety function prediction while in practice, we would want to establish a probabilistic bound on a user-specified constraint g(x) >= h where h is given. Theorem 1 does not provide any handle on this.\n\n---\n\nMinor point: \n\nThe algorithmic exposition is also unclear at several points. For example, in Algorithm 1 (line 6), it is not clear how L_t is defined. Furthermore, how do we update it in line 6?"

            "questions": {
                "value": "Based on the above, I have two specific questions:\n\n1. Could you flesh out Algorithm 1 mathematically in the rebuttal?\n2. Could you elaborate on how Theorem 1 can be positioned to guarantee that with a certain algorithmic configuration, the proposed algorithm would induce P(g(x) >= h) >= alpha for a given h?\n3. Based on 1. and 2., it would be good to highlight the non-triviality of putting together the ideas of safe exploration & BO on latent space. Otherwise, a simple loose coupling of these ideas is somewhat below bar for me -- I of course appreciate the practical empirical experiment -- I think the set of experiments is good but that alone is probably not enough to meet the acceptance bar."
