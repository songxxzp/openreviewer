Although, on this point, I think the authors should compare with the study of how signal-to-noise ratio affects the learning at a large learning rate in (1) https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11774 and (2) https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13093"

The problem setting. First of all, what is a ReLU^2 activation function? I have never seen this. Is ReLU more essential to the proof or is the quadratic effect more essential to the proof? Does the result hold for ReLU? Does the result hold for the quadratic activation? This is unanswered in the paper. To me, this activation neither feels theoretically appealing nor practically relevant\n\n2. Problem setting 2. The second layer is not trained. Essentially, we understand that training with one layer is very different from training multiple layers simultaneously. For example, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11787\n\n3. Problem setting 3. The model architecture -- the authors refer to the model as a \"CNN,\" which just does not feel right to me. I doubt if the majority of readers would agree that this model is indeed a CNN. \n\nIn summary, the point is the same, the problem setting is not sufficiently simple to be considered theoretically essential, nor is it sufficiently realistic.

While they show that this oscillation is *consistent* with their hypothesis, it could be great that the authors comment a bit more of this necessity to assume this. How difficult would it be to remove this hypothesis ? Is the problem to control that the iterates do not diverge ? Or on the contrary that they do no converge locally ?\n\n- If this is the second option, could the authors add some (bounded) label noise at each iteration to show this? This is what is explained to be done in a series of paper like *Label noise (stochastic) gradient descent implicitly solves the Lasso for quadratic parametrisation* L. Pillaud-Vivien et al., COLT, 2022. Could the authors comment on this?"
