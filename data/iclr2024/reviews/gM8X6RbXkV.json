The authors argue that previous methods such as label-free CBM focus on only image-level concepts and therefore could lose fine-grained details in the image. However, one could also argue that the fine-grained details in the image are already well summarized into the image-level concepts. For example, the CUB dataset does contain a large number of low-level concepts (information) such as color and shape of birds\u2019 parts. \n\nEquation 6 essentially introduces an additional gating mechanism to turn on/off different concepts. The key goal is to introduce sparsity of concept activation. While this make sense to me, why not use a simpler approach, e.g., sending S_H into another linear layer, followed by some L1 regularization? Would that work too?\n\nThe proposed method seems to heavily build on Panousis et al., 2023, introducing limited novelty. For example, the whole high-level concept discovery section is nearly identical to Panousis et al., 2023. For the low-level concept discovery, it is actually a simple adaptation, i.e., replacing the whole image in Equation (3-6) with each patch, resulting in Equation (7-9). The only difference is in the aggregation of the patch-level information and the link between both levels. \n\nThe idea of using pretrained models like CLIP is not new either, with the baseline label-free CBMs as an example. \n\nThe notation is a bit confusing. In Equation (7), does $[P]_n$ refer to the collection of all $P_n$ where $n$ goes from 1 to P? Or does it only refer to the $n$-th patch? Or does it refer to all patches from Image $n$? If it is the former, this is no different from Equation (3). Similar questions arise for Equation (8). What is $c$ in the size of $P_p$? Is it the number of image channels?\n\nIt is unclear how to draw the line between high-level concepts and low-level attributes. In Section 3.3 the authors mentioned *cat* as a high-level concept and *eggs* as low-level attributes. Why couldn\u2019t *eggs* be a high-level concept? This also goes back to the motivation of introducing low-level concepts mentioned in the comments above. From Section 4, it seems the so-called *concept* is simply the class label and the low-level concepts are actually the commonly used *concept* in CUB/SUN? This does not make too much sense. \n\nIn terms of performance, the proposed CPM underperforms CDM by a considerable margin on both CUB and SUN. Also, it is not fair to claim that label-free CBMs is not capable of concept discovery, since they do automatically discover concepts using CLIP. The only advantage is in terms of sparsity, which can actually be trivially enforced by additional sparsity constraints in label-free CBMs."

This method, instead of the conventional whole-image similarity approach, employs a concept hierarchy that targets specific regions of the image for granular concept analysis. The framework's effectiveness is backed by experimental results, showing superiority over existing CBM methods and advancing towards a principled path for interpretable models. The approach emphasizes both low-level and high-level concept discovery, using text and attributes for detailed image patch descriptions and classes for holistic image understanding. A linkage matrix, learned from the data, defines the interplay between these concept levels, resulting in a structured and interpretable model."

(2023) is referred to as the 'high level concept discovery' in this current paper. This paper proposes to split an image into non-overlapping patches and repeat the same method to obtain 'low level concepts' for each patch. A max-pool is applied to predict the image class from the the patch level outputs. The paper then proposes a method to obtain a map between the low level and high level concepts. The joint-model is trained using stochastic gradient variational bayes and the results are compared with other state of the art methods."

Further, the paper also unfolds a paradigm in concept discovery for enabling multi-level concept selection.

It'd have been better to say \"two-level\" or \"coarse-to-fine concepts\", instead of \"hierarchical multi-level\". \n* Sec 3.3 talks about how the high-level and low-level concepts are connected. It states that the presence of a high-level concept provides information on which low-level concepts may or may not exist. I would have expected to see the concepts organized the other way \u2013 the presence of a set of low-level concepts triggers a high-level concept, the way it would happen in a visual processing pathway. Why is this flipped? What are the implications of this flip? \n* Continuing with the above point, if the high-level concept is first inferred, can\u2019t the low-level concepts be inferred in an independent manner without the network itself? Acc to Fig 1, there is an independent classification layer for high-level and low-level concepts anyway, and one could use just the high-level module to classify.\n* The need for hierarchical concept selection could be strengthened by designing experiments in CPM setting with A_Hactivations and without (replace it with whole set) to see the performance of A_L since the proposed model relies on both activations. Such ablation studies and detailed analysis seems lacking. For another example, experiments on different size of concept-pool would also help in evaluating the overall performance of the method across a varied condition resulting in validating the findings better. As stated earlier, including more levels of concept would be needed to strengthen the idea presented as a \u201cmulti-level concept discovery\u201d work.\n* Technically speaking, the work seems to be a derivative of the cited paper \u201cSparse Linear Concept Discovery Models\u201d; the architectural differences lie in the use of two-level of concepts: high and low, rather than a single set of concepts. Furthermore, important ideas have been drawn from the paper such as sparsity inducing Bayesian approach. \n* The idea of multi-level concepts can be introduced directly in a standard CBM too, such that high-level concept activations in the first would trigger the low-level concept activations (with end-to-end). Why will this not address the stated purpose? \n* It is not clear why Region-CLIP or other CLIP variants that deal with images at the level of patches/superpixels/regions were not considered for the second level of concepts.\n* The literature survey does not seem complete; there are papers like \u201cProbabilistic CBMs, ICML 2023\u201d that have been missed. \n\n\n*Minor suggestions:*\n* I would recommend using \\citep for references used as part of a sentence vs \\cite in another places. This helps the readability of the paper.\n* In Eqns 1 and 3, A seems undefined. It appears that it should be \\mathbb{A}. Please correct this."

                "value": "1. The paper, in its introduction, lists limitations of CBM models. It is not clear why \"(iii) their interpretability is substantially impaired due to the sheer amount of considered concepts, and (iv) they are not suited for tasks that require greater granularity.\" are a problem for CBMs. How does having a large number of concepts actually affect CBMs? I found this argument to be rather weak.\n2. A similar statement is also made in Sec 2: \"With the number of concepts ranging from the 100s to the 1000s, this can severely undermine the sought-after interpretability.\" Why do a large number of concepts affect interpretability?"
