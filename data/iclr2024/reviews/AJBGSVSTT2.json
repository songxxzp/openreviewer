It's noticeable that all BC layers in the provided experiments are fully connected (fc) layers. Is there a specific rationale or intuition behind this? Given that BC layers are often the first fc layer, it could be intriguing to explore adjustments in their structure, size, and hyperparameters. Additionally, is there a possibility that within a single BC layer, certain parameters or neurons are more crucial than others? If this is the case, why not consider selecting critical parameters or neurons across multiple layers instead of exclusively focusing on critical layers?\n\n3. What is the reasoning behind the sequence of Local Training, Forward Layer Substitution, and Backward Layer Substitution, as opposed to individually training each layer using poisoned data and subsequently sorting them?"
