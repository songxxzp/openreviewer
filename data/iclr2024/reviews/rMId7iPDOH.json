To distinguish these two cases, this paper considers a multi-environment setup in which the user is aware of multiple datasets with the same content but different styles. Given a pre-trained backbone, the paper introduces a feature selection method called Stylist, which selects the more env-invariant features by computing perturbations across environments. By focusing solely on the env-invariant features, Stylist improves upon previous feature-based novelty detection methods."

In doing so, it proposes an intuitive method that can be integrated with existing techniques, resulting in a clear improvement over the baseline.\nWhile tackling a niche problem can be an easy way to write a paper, I believe that in representative venues like ICLR, the focus should be on addressing the core of the problem rather than opting for low-hanging fruit.\n\nThe authors could explore more impactful problems. For example, a single scalar uncertainty metric fails to differentiate between novel styles and contents. The proposed Stylist can be viewed as introducing a two-dimensional uncertainty to address this limitation.\nBuilding on this concept, the authors might consider developing a unified framework that addresses both domain generalization and novelty detection in real-world situations.\n\n---\n**Comparison with invariant learning**\n\nThe paper aims to select domain-invariant features in a post-hoc manner. However, features can also be trained to be invariant using methods such as IRM.\nA comparison between the proposed post-hoc feature selection and invariant learning is necessary, considering both domain generalization (tables in IRM) and novelty detection (tables in this paper).\n\n---\n**CLIP should be the default backbone choice**\n\nIn the methods section, the paper states, \"our approach leverages pretrained embeddings with extensive coverage across various content and style categories.\"\nHowever, the paper uses ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet for the main results, which does not align with the statement.\n\nThe paper should primarily consider models like CLIP, which are trained on diverse datasets and known to be robust to domain shifts.\nThe paper presents the CLIP results in Table 2, and the performance gap is significantly lower than that of the (domain-variant) ResNet.\nThus, the overall benefits of the proposed method may be exaggerated, and it would be more appropriate to conduct the main results using the less domain-variant models like CLIP.\n\n---\n**Hyperparameter selection**\n\nThe OOD detection competitors considered in the paper apply simple methods, such as OCSVM or kNN, on top of a fixed representation.\nGiven that this paper refines the representation, it is unsurprising that the proposed method enhances the original representation when appropriate hyperparameters are selected.\n\nFurthermore, how were the hyperparameters selected? It seems they were chosen for optimal performance in the reported table.\nHowever, (1) hyperparameters should not be spoiled by the test cases, and (2) the OOD detection method should be robust to unseen samples.\nThe correct approach is to select hyperparameters in a validation domain and evaluate their performance on novel test domains.\n\n---\n**Dataset contribution is marginal**\n\n(1) The necessity of COCOShift95 over prior works is unclear.\\\nThe paper introduces a new benchmark called COCOShift95, where objects are cut and shifted to different backgrounds.\nConsequently, this benchmark is artificial and does not demand substantial effort, unlike previous works such as fMoW and DomainNet, which require considerable effort to collect realistic images.\nWhat new insights can be gained from COCOShift95, aside from adding yet another column to the table?\n\n(2) The cut and paste strategy has been considered in prior works.\\\nThe approach of creating an artificial dataset through cut and paste has been proposed in previous works, such as Waterbirds and Background Challenge.\nAdditionally, why not use more natural benchmarks, such as MetaShift, which also include multi-domain images from COCO?\nTherefore, the technical contribution of the proposed dataset collection strategy is also not convincing.\n\n---\n**Nitpicks**\n\n- \"+0.0\" should not be highlighted in green in Table 3. It exaggerates the benefit of the proposed method.\n- \"Stylist\" seems to be too ambiguous as a name for the feature selection method in multi-domain novelty detection."

The authors note that their approach is different from previous work in that it focuses on feature ranking rather than domain adaptation or anomaly detection. They also highlight the importance of identifying environment-biased features that contain spurious correlations and should be ignored for novelty detection.\n\nThe authors' contributions include a formalization of the problem of detecting novel environments based on semantic and style changes, a feature ranking approach that focuses on dropping environment-biased features, and an evaluation of their method on several benchmark datasets.
