                "value": "The authors address how gradient-based feature learning interacts with anistropic input data. They do this by studying the sparse parity problem where feature coordinates have varying magnitudes. To this end, they analyze the learning complexity of the mean-field Langevin dynamics, which describes the noisy gradient descent update on two-layer neural networks. They show one can use the anisotropy of the data to improve the statistical complexity (i.e. sample size) and computational complexity (i.e. network width) of the mean-field Langevin dynamics. This improvement is found when the main directions of the anisotropic input data aligns with the support of the target function. They also provide a method using coordinate transformations determined by the gradient covariance to show that the computational complexity can be improved by exploiting the anisotropy."

It would be great if the authors could better motivate a connection between this problem and more general neural networks with real-world datasets.\n\n- The authors state on page 2, under \"Feature learning under structured data\", that \n\n  > in certain regression settings with low-dimensional target, structured data with a spiked covariance structure can improve the performance of both kernel methods and optimized NNs (Ghorbani et al., 2020; Ba et al., 2023; Mousavi-Hosseini et al., 2023; Suzuki et al., 2023b). However, these regression analyses do not directly translate to the binary classification setting which the k-parity problem belongs to.\n\n  This implies that the intuition \"anisotropy helps\" is perhaps already observed in the literature, which may weaken the impact of the paper.

This is not to speak negatively about this work, but it seems that this topic is less generally relevant in its nature and may not be best suited to this large-scale style of conference. \n\n* Could the authors provide a definition of anisotropic input data?
