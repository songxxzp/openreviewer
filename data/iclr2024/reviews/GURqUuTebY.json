By reframing text-to-3D optimization as a multi-view image-to-image translation problem, the authors propose a new gradient update rule to drive the optimization. Besides, through the use of a predetermined timestep schedule, the algorithm improves the speed and quality. The paper claims that DreamFlow is 5 times faster and produces higher quality 3D content than existing methods."

Although the authors are developing an optimization loss from a different angle, the algorithm they ultimately present is actually the same as Variational Score Distillation (VSD). Similarly, I also noticed that the results obtained by the authors are similar to those of VSD. From this perspective, it doesn't seem sufficiently novel.\n(2). The author mentions that score distillation uses randomly drawn time steps at each update. However, there have already been many works that use a linear time schedule, which decreases from large t to small t during optimization. Additionally, there is a specialized work (DreamTime) that specifically studies this point. From this perspective, the technique does not appear to be original or novel.\n\n2. Unclear Connection Between Motivation and Technical Details:\n(1). From the abstract and introduction, it is evident that the authors' motivation is to address the issue of gradient variance. However, the methods section does not clearly explain how the proposed method or modeling perspective is related to the problem of gradient variance. \nThey only visualize the gradient norm in the experimental section at the end to indicate that it is more stable (of \"norm\", instead of \"direction\"). However, this also relates to the time schedule; a random time schedule would naturally result in varying magnitudes of the gradient because the intensity of diffusion output scores can vary based on the timestep t.\n(2). It remains unclear why this (\"norm\") variance is problematic for the optimization process. How is this demonstrated? For optimization, the direction of the gradient seems to be more important than its magnitude. In the experimental section on page 8, the author states, \"This is because of the randomly drawn timestep during optimization, which makes optimization unstable. Thus, we observe that VSD often results in poor geometry during optimization, or over-saturated.\" I am unclear about the logical relationship indicated by \"thus\" here."

Is your model only applicable to a linear schedule?\nWhat distinguishes your method from the timestep annealing mentioned in works like DreamTime?\n\n3. Does your modeling approach have any broader applications? For instance, are there applications that could not be achieved in previous score distillation methods but might be feasible with your model?\n\n4. Please elaborate on the differences and similarities between your method and VSD, as the final formulations appear to be nearly identical.\n\n5. Please elaborate in detail on where the improvements in experimental results come from. For example, why is it faster, why do you think the results are better than VSD, and have you conducted independent ablation studies?

I think the same thing can be implemented for VSD as well, but no such comparison is shown. Maybe this sampling method is more naturally motivated for this method than VSD.
