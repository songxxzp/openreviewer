                "value": "- The authors propose a new architecture for geometric graphs that combines simplical message-passing, Clifford algebras, and equivariance.\n- On a high level, their approach is based on linking the expansion in the number of vertices that occurs in simplices with the expansion in grades in a Clifford algebra.\n- A given geometric graph is first lifted to simplices, then the outputs are computed with a message-passing algorithm between the simplices. Different from Bodnar et al (2021), the proposed algorithm uses Clifford algebras as representations, the geometric product to compute simplex features, and Clifford Group Equivariant NNs (Ruhe et al, 2023) to construct messages. These changes add a geometric inductive bias to the algorithm and make it equivariant.\n- The algorithm is demonstrated on experiments ranging from simple toy data to motion capture data, molecular dynamics, and even NBA data."

                "value": "- The authors overstate the naturality of their method. While the approach feels intuitive at a quick glance, it mixes two different concepts: Simplices are a topological concept, while the geometric product is related to the geometric space that the graph is embedded in. This leads to a number of issues. Even in 3D space, one can construct 100-simplices, but the Clifford algebra only goes up to grade 4. While intuitively higher-order simplices encode more information, higher-order grades eventually become lower-dimensional. More generally, the geometric product is lossy: different simplices will be described by the same multivector. These all seem like undesirable properties for a simplex representation. I wish the authors would acknowledge and discuss these issues, which to me seem central to this paper.\n- While I like the experiments, it would be useful to see the performance on more standard benchmarks of geometric deep learning. The authors acknowledge that they do not achieve SOTA results on some of these tasks. That's fine, but it would still be useful to see how the method performs compared to other generic equivariant methods.\n- The paper's contributions are somewhat thin: the authors essentially plug together two existing ideas (simplical message passing and Clifford group equivariant networks). Of course, the same can be said about many other papers."

It's well possible I missed something here.\n- On page 2, what do you mean with \"geometric products are meaningful in all such cases\"?\n- On page 7, you mention that you use an equal parameter count for CSMPN and the baselines. Is that really fair when compairing equivariant and non-equivariant baselines? Usually, equivariant methods have far less parameters for the same expressivity."

To implement it, the paper discusses methods for lifting a set of points to a simplicial complex and embedding simplicial data in the Clifford algebra, where various types of lifts like Vietoris-Rips and manual lifts are considered. The results and evaluations of the CSMPNs are across various domains showing the effectiveness of this method."
