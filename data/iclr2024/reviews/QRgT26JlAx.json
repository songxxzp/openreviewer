The paper models such temporal label noise via a matrix function (num classes x num classes), as is standard in the literature, but parameterized by time, which is new. The authors propose extensions of the so-called 'forward' and 'backward' loss correction mechanisms for empirical risk minimization on training data with temporal noise, and show that ERM using the proposed losses under noisy labels is equivalent to ERM on the clean data, i.e., their Bayes optimal classifiers coincide. The noise function however also needs to be estimated from the data -- so the authors propose a joint training objective to learn the noise function and the classifier, by parameterizing the noise function via a neural network. Empirical results and various ablations show the effectiveness of the proposed formulation and the learning algorithms. \n\nOverall I think the paper has enough merits but there're some missing details that need to be resolved so that I can better evaluate the contributions. I've some questions below which I'd like the authors respond to in their rebuttal."

If even if there are not any theoretical guarantees for TENOR method, it would be good to discuss why the optimization works and is not derailed by too much label noise (in the experiments, I see even for about 30% noise, the learning is pretty robust). \n- More importantly, it's unclear how the TENOR objective imposes regularity across time 't', e.g. if we know the label noise say increases with time in the instances, or varies sinusoidally, etc., it's surprising that the model can learn such Q(t) functions, without any additional regularization or at least a good initial point. The Frobenius norm reg. can't do this. Part of this confusion arises because of my lack of clarity in how Q_w(t) is modeled via a neural network -- are there just one set of weights and an additional 't' parameter (integer) that gives the noise matrix estimates across 't'?\n- Theorems 1 and 2 are about equivalences, but there are no forms of estimation/finite sample guarantees in the paper."
