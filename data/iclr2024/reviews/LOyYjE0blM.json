                "value": "1. The authors repeatedly use the phrase \u201cprecursor training task\u201d and equate this with \u201ccausal language modeling.\u201d Causal language modeling is an example of a self-supervised training strategy or a pre-training objective. Using these more commonly used terms and removing this equivalency will improve the clarity of the work. Similarly, \u201ctask-specific readouts\u201d refers to 3-layer MLPs / classifier heads.\n\n2. Because the major claim of the paper relies on the novelty of the IBP task and resulting performance improvements, there should be a naive pre-training baseline other than random weight initialization. For example, prior work in NLP shows that simple synthetic pre-training tasks [Wu, Yuhuai, Felix Li, and Percy S. Liang. \"Insights into pre-training via simpler synthetic tasks.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 21844-21857.] can achieve similar benefits.\n\n3. The authors might consider reading and citing the literature of neural scaling and \u201cfoundation models\u201d specifically related to chemistry, where multiple prior works contain detailed discussions and results related to neural scaling and pre-training for small molecule chemistry; and [Caballero, Ethan, et al. \"Broken neural scaling laws.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.14891 (2022).], which discusses the functional form of scaling laws.\n\n4. The axis labels in Fig 2b have no quantitative meaning and can be removed. \n\n5. Neural scaling laws are almost always proposed with respect to a pre-training loss (e.g., cross-entropy loss for a causal language model). Improvements in this loss may or may not result in improvements measured on downstream tasks. It is confusing to refer to the MoA deconvolution accuracy results as a function of model size and dataset size as a \u201cneural scaling law\u201d, when there is nothing presented of the form L ~ x^(-beta). What does the IBP validation loss look like as a function of compute, model and dataset size?\n\n6. A scaling curve provides a best-case scenario; it is not a guarantee that 100% accuracy on MoA will be achieved at 14M additional experiments. This assumption ignores aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in the assay and resolution limitations in the scaling performance.\n\n7. Can the authors provide more discussion and justification of why the approach uses an MLP trained on vector embeddings rather than a CNN or MLP-mixer trained directly on cell painting images?\n\n8. What are the relevant baselines for tasks for which cell profiler is not compared against?\n\n9. Have the authors considered regularization to prevent overfitting to their small datasets?"

This paper hardly scratches the surface on any such respect and is clearly far from the lofty goals discussed in the intro.\n\nOverall, the presentation is convoluted at times and makes unreasonable baseline assumptions: was the original task basically a small resnet directly predicting some of the annotations without any pretraining on any type of images?  (How should I read this sentence to understand the actual architecture: \"DNNs consisted of 1, 3, 6, 9, or 12 layers of these blocks, each with 128, 256, 512, or 1512 features.\"?)

If not, perhaps drop the second copy of the molecule.\n\nWould any lessons from past datasets, say those released by Recursion over the years including past competitions, help with the architectures, the self-supervised tasks, or with understanding of the problem domain? Or is this JUMP dataset completely unrelated to the limited past disclosures and thus there are no lessons learned from them?"
