For example, in the delayed reward setting (SMAC), the agents only receive the reward at the last timestep, the credit assignment of the whole trajectory in MACCA is only related to the state and actions of the last timestep, which is unreasonable.\n\nThe states of the environments adopted by this paper are low-dimension vectors.

Specifically in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) settings, the diversity in different distributions of data complicates the task of assigning individual credits. To address this problem, the paper proposes a framework named Multi-Agent Causal Credit Assignment (MACCA). After discussing the related work in offline MARL and multi-agent credit assignment and the preliminaries of the method, the paper breaks down the MACCA framework into offline data generation, causal model learning, and policy learning with assigned individual rewards. The estimates of the observation and reward produced by the agents in the policy learning phase are fed into the policy network for generating the next-state actions. The authors conducted experiments in various environments and compared their method with the other baselines that follow the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) and independent learning paradigms. They also carried out ablation studies to evaluate the interpretability and efficiency of their approach."

It is very obvious that the method consists of generative process, causal model learning phase, and policy optimization by reading this section. In the experiments, a sufficient number of baselines are applied for performance comparison and most of them are relatively new. Three different MARL testbeds are used for evaluation, which shows the generalization capability of the method. Careful ablation studies are performed in order to clarify the impacts of causal structure, ground truth individual reward, and causal graph setting. Furthermore, the math used here is formal and clear, improving the soundness of this work. The proof of identifiability is correct and a good supplement to the paper."

There are some grammatical errors, and the details will follow.\n\nAlthough the evaluation of MACCA has been conducted in multiple benchmarks to demonstrate its generalizability, it is questionable whether the method has top performance in all of the environments that belong to a specific benchmark. For example, the SMAC benchmark has more than 20 original battle scenarios, including a few Super Hard challenges. However, only three of the maps, including a single Super Hard challenge, are shown in the results.\n\nRegarding the MACCA architecture, clearly, the policy learning part is crucial for the model. However, this part is mostly taken from previously established methods such as I-CQL, OMAR and MA-ICQ, especially the term $J_{\\pi}$. Also, after looking at the experiments in different environments, it is not clear whether MACCA-CQL, MACCA-OMAR, or MACCA-ICQ has the SOTA performance overall.\n\nThe code for the proposed method is not included in the submission. The disclosed information about the hyper-parameters and environmental settings is limited.\n\nA few more points worth mentioning:\n \n- The figure or the algorithm in Appendix D can be moved to the main paper to improve the clarity of the description for MACCA.\n \n- In section 3, when defining the Dec-POMDP, an additional $\\Omega$ is included in the tuple as it denotes the joint observation space. Then the observation function is expressed as $\\mathcal{O}(s, i) : \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow \\Omega$.\n \n- In section 4.1: Define $D_s$ and $D_a$ as the {numbers} of dimentions of ...
