The authors emphasize that these evaluations should encompass a wide range of tasks and domains. They cite several benchmark datasets and metrics, both automatic and human-based, commonly used for evaluating LLMs in various areas, such as chatbot performance and knowledge assessment.\n\nThe paper introduces second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) into the evaluation of LLMs, which the authors claim provides a more nuanced assessment of risk compared to traditional metrics like standard deviation.\n\nThe paper outlines the statistical tests for assessing almost and relative stochastic dominance and their theoretical underpinnings. They highlight the importance of central limit theorems and bootstrapping in estimating the statistical significance of these tests."

Since the connection of two topics is also not very clear, I would suggest that splitting the paper into two might be useful.\n2. **No quantitative or qualitative assessment criteria are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation method.** In my understanding, this paper proposes a new, statistically robust risk-assessment metric to compare two (multi-variate) probability distributions. However, the paper lacks an empirical demonstration of how the proposed method overcomes the issues of existing metrics. Given the focus of this paper, just applying the proposed metric to evaluate various LLMs is not enough. In addition, for the portfolio selection part, the paper should investigate if the proposed metric aligns with human preference more than other existing metrics to demonstrate the benefit of the proposed method.\n3. **The manuscript is hard to follow.** The paper sometimes lacks explanations of theorems or motivations to introduce theorems.

Then, deriving (4) seems straightforward, and I couldn't understand why the complex theory is needed for SSD. The manuscript should provide more explicit motivation for the theoretical analysis.\n\n2. Are (1) and (2) always be equivalent? Similarly, are (3) and (5) always equivalent? In my understanding, (1) measures the cumulative probability of observing performance less than $\\eta$, and (2) measures the $p$% quartile. It is not clear if (1) is always equivalent to (2) because they are measuring different quantities (though the statement may be true under some specific conditions about $\\eta$ and $p$). Similarly, (3) measures the area under the CDF, while (5) measures CVaR. If the paper claims that (1) and (2) (or (3) and (5)) are equivalent, either citation or proofs should be included about this part.\n\n3. What does the paper mean by \"Note that FSD implies SSD, hence SSD is a finer notion of dominance\"? Does it mean that FSD is a special case of SSD?\n\n4. What is the intuitive understanding of $\\epsilon$-FSD? Does it mean the probability that $X$ is preferred to $Y$ under the FSD criteria?\n\n**Other minor things (typos)**\n- page 4: period (.) is needed right before Eq.

The proposed methodology has analogies with portfolio selection and optimization under risk aversion. First, an overview of the notion of stochastic dominance is performed, in terms of cumulative distribution and quantile functions. This involves covering relaxations of stochastic dominance and introducing the notion of relative dominance. Afterwards, asymptotically normal test statistics are derived to test for stochastic dominance and relative stochastic dominance. Finally, the presented methods are applied to assessing distributional risk in foundation models. The key idea here is to evaluate the model on multiple tasks that each output some sort of metric of interest, and then to pool together a \"portfolio\" of metrics, finally comparing the models by comparing their portfolios using the tests proposed in the paper. The method is then tested on some complex real-world models."

                "value": "The connection between mathematical theory and the applied problem at hand is not emphasised enough. The transition between theoretical sections and experiments is somewhat abrupt. Simulation experiments validating statistical significance do not reflect real data experiments. Overall, I believe the paper can benefit from more clarity on the connection between the theory and the applied problem, a more realistic validation study on the simulated data and a much more explicit discussion of the failure modes of the methods (which assumptions need to be satisfied for the method to be theoretically justified and whether one indeed can check if these assumptions are satisfied in practice)."

I cannot quite connect this to the \u201cmore realistic\u201d experiments later on. The fact that this works for two Gaussian random variables does not necessarily imply that it works in a similar way for more complex experiments. \n\n-\tThe point above is also related to the underlying assumptions of the method. It is not uncommon to assume in some mean-risk models underlying Gaussian distribution. However, many attempts have been made to relax this assumption in finance since it is deemed to be unrealistic. How essential is it for the problem at hand?\n\n-\tWhat other assumptions need to hold for the method to have theoretical validity? How can one check if these assumptions indeed hold before applying the proposed method? \n\n-\tA lot of results are mixed and are presented in the appendix, even if described in the main text. I believe the paper could use restructuring to highlight the most relevant results and theory in the main text."

Observing the desirability of such a comparison for evaluating machine learning models (esp. those likely to have large exposure to end users, such as language models), the current paper improves upon previous results from the econometrics literature to develop a statistical significance test for almost second order stochastic dominance (SSD) between random variables, as well as a variant of this test for comparing multiple random variables. They combine this test with a simple rank aggregation scheme, and a weighted geometric mean of different metrics (called metrics portfolio) to produce a ranking among a number of models, tested on the said metrics. They compare their method to other methods for ranking language models."

Please see the comments in the next section.\n- There are long stretches where the text reads like it is from an econometrics paper, with the lack of emphasis on how the introduced concepts will be relevant for model comparison distracting from the main contributions of the paper. I recommend being more sensitive to the conference audiences' background, and frequently reminding the reader how a concept or result will help resolve an important sub/problem in the overall model comparison. See the first sentence of my summary of the paper for a simple example of an arguably more accessible framing.\n- In the experiments, the paper's results with SSD almost perfectly line up with those obtained by using previously known mean-risk models: I believe that how exactly the current methodology improves upon these simple and useful models is not sufficiently discussed."
