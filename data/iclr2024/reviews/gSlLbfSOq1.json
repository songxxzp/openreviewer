This is especially targeted at disease progression in longitudinal medical images. The method uses an encoder to project scans from different time points into a representation space and employs a temporal equivariance module that can predict future representations using existing ones. Unlike other methods, this approach directly transforms medical image representations in time, capturing irreversible anatomical changes, like those due to degenerative diseases. The authors introduced a regularization loss term to maintain the sensitivity of the time parameter and constructed contrastive pairs from different patient visits to learn patient-specific features. The method outperforms other equivariant contrastive methods on two temporal eye scan datasets, emphasizing the importance of temporal sensitivity for assessing disease progression risk. The TC method's main limitation is its reliance on irreversible diseases with scans acquired at discrete intervals."

The proposed TC method has been tested and has demonstrated superior performance against other state-of-the-art equivariant contrastive techniques. This is evident from its application on two temporal datasets related to eye scans, which solidifies its robustness and reliability.\n\nS3. The paper does a good job of articulating the need and significance of the proposed method. The clear presentation of the challenges associated with degenerative diseases, especially the irreversible nature of certain anatomical changes, underscores the importance and timeliness of the TC method.\n\nS4. The potential ramifications of the TC method in the medical field is highlighted. Its ability to predict disease progression and effectively assess a patient's risk of advancing to more severe stages of a disease can be a game-changer in patient care and medical diagnosis. This predictive capability is not just about identifying risk but also about enabling timely and personalized interventions.\nS5. The TC method's ability to generate future representations without needing corresponding patient scans showcases its versatility. This feature is particularly beneficial for medical scenarios where timely scans might not be available but predictions are essential for patient care."

                "value": "W1. While the TC method introduces a promising approach for handling irreversible diseases with discretely acquired scans, its utility seems confined to this specific scenario. The real world of medical conditions is vast, and many diseases do not follow a strictly irreversible path. The narrow scope potentially limits the method's broader applicability across the diverse landscape of medical imaging and conditions.\n\nW2. The method heavily relies on the assumption that degenerative diseases follow a monotonic non-decreasing function over time. This is a strong assumption that might not hold across all conditions or datasets. Diseases can have varying trajectories, with periods of stability, rapid progression, or even temporary reversal. Basing a method on this assumption might lead to inaccuracies in real-world applications.\n\nW3. Although the paper claims superior performance against other methods, a deeper comparative analysis, considering a broader range of conditions, datasets, and variability, would be more convincing. A comprehensive comparison would provide clarity on the margin and conditions of this outperformance.\n\nW4. Medical images are notorious for their variability and potential anomalies, especially given the variation between patients, imaging equipment, and acquisition protocols. The paper does not delve deeply into how the TC method would handle potential anomalies, outliers, or inconsistencies in the longitudinal medical images.\n\nW5. While the paper alludes to reduced complexity in comparison to other models, a more explicit discussion or breakdown of computational costs, resource requirements, and scalability considerations is conspicuously missing. For real-world application, especially in clinical settings, understanding computational overhead is crucial.\n\nW6. The paper mentions that temporal medical datasets are costly to obtain and challenging to release publicly. This heavy reliance on hard-to-obtain datasets can be a significant bottleneck for the practical application and scalability of the TC method. Additional experiments with non-medical images would provide beneficial to applicability of this model into other fields and since it already has the potential, lack of its presence is a weakness in the paper.\n\nW7. The introduction of a regularization loss term, crucial for maintaining time parameter sensitivity, is presented without an in-depth rationale or derivation. A clearer explanation of this term's derivation, its impact on the model's performance, and sensitivity analyses would provide more confidence in the method's robustness.\n\nW8. There are only 3 baselines tested for the experiments and for these the performance improvement is minor. Error bars should be added to identify whether these performance improvements are significant and how robust to different random seeds is the model compared to the other baselines."

However, when using such contrastive learning approaches, it is standard to make sure that the random perturbations/transformations used for data augmentation only consist of changes that the model shouldn't care about whereas the ones that we actually want the latent embedding representation to learn should not be used in data augmentation. Am I missing something here?\n- How does the proposed method TC relate to steerable equivariant representation learning (Bhardwaj et al 2023)?\n- Please update the experimental setup so that error bars could be reported (such as running experimental repeats with different random seeds and reporting mean/std dev of different achieved evaluation scores).\n- Overall I would like to see a much more detailed discussion of precisely why the authors think that the proposed method at times outperforms existing 3 equivariant contrastive methods.\n- There is a large body of literature on medical image registration.
