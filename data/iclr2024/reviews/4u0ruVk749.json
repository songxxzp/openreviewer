Lack of discussion on why diffusion models can tackle unmeasured confounding. \n\nI think a huge missing part here is to justify why diffusion model can tackle causal inference problems and unmeasured confounding. This could be improved by re-organizing the paper a bit. Instead of directly coming up with diffusion model, it is helpful to first explain why generating synthetic unmeasured confounding can be useful, and how. Then, one can talk about why diffusion model is a useful tool in doing so. In particular, there appears to be no \"causal\" thinking across Section 3. I even cannot see what the unmeasured confounder is in the expressions. Is it $x^{(T)}$? Why can we learn it from data given that we never observe them? Is that because there are observable implications of a correct unmeasured confounder that we can leverage in the training? What does the variational lower bound mean? Why maximizing the log likelihood gives a good sampler for unmeasured confounding? Also, though section 4 appears at the end of theory & method, maybe it is more appropriate as a motivating point. \n\n2. Missing details of the experiments. \n\nThough the experiments are thorough, and given the provided codebase, I believe the methods are solid. But due to missing details I am confused how the performance is evaluated, such as how do we get the ground truth, and how is the ground truth defined. \n\n3.

I'm also not sure how to access the true $\\tau$ here. Do we have ground truths of the ITEs?

(2017), which could restrict the model\u2019s flexibility.\u201d\n\nIn the Introduction section, the authors give the example that the environment in which the patient lives and works (ita) can affect both the patient's socio-economic status (observed confounder X) and gene (the unobserved confounder Z). Can the authors use this example to illustrate the forward diffusion process and the reverse diffusion process? For all formulas in section 3.1, only ita and X are involved. How does Z come into play? It needed clarification on how z_i is derived by the diffusion model as zi ~ \\miu_theta (c, t. ita_i) + beta_t \\ipsilon (the third line after formula 13).\n\nThe authors use the Gaussian transition kernel. Would it only work when X is a continuous variable? Can X be more than one dimension? What if X is discrete?\n\nCan the authors provide details on what variables are treated as X and Z in the two real data examples, ACIC 2016 and IHDP, and how are Z inferred?\n\nSince Z is only inferred from X and both X and Z are included in the model to learn ITE. It was not clear to me how this additional step of inferring Z from X would help, especially when the ITE is learned from the flexible neural network models. Isn\u2019t all the information already captured in X? Also, how the proposed diffusion model guarantee that Z is learned correctly?\n\nAs the authors pointed out, the distance metric (the last term in Formula 13) used to balance two distributions play a significant role in improving the estimation of ITE. Therefore, I wonder, is the diffusion model better than the VAE (used in CEVAE) to learn the unobserved confounder, or is the benefit mainly driven by the use of the distance metric? Also, even in the synthetic datasets, methods that do not account for unmeasured confounding such as TARnet and CFR_MMD have very good performance and even outperforms the proposed."

                "value": "This work tackles the problem of unobserved confounder measuring in the scope of estimating Individual Treatment Effect (ITE). The authors proposed to use diffusion model to fit on the observed covariates and generate representations for unobserved covariates using sample from an intermediate time step in the reverse process. The generated representations are then incorporated in the downstream learning task, which is jointly optimized with the diffusion variational lower bound. Experiments are conducted on various datasets (including simulation datasets) with various benchmark, where the proposed model showed best performance among benchmarks on some of the evaluation metrics."

Experiments are done thoroughly with various benchmarks, and visualization of the results helped understanding model performance. Overall, the topic of the paper is of decent significancy as unobserved confounders is a crucial problem for causal identifiability, and incorporating modern deep learning tool to tackle this problem is an interesting angle."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I don't stand by the theoretical justification for using diffusion model to generate unobserved confounder. It does not align with the causal graph you proposed in Figure 1, in which $Z$ and $X$ are conditionally independent given $\\eta$. Thus, generating $z$ by using $\\mu_\\theta$ plus noise makes no sense to me.\n\nBesides, the factorization in the proof of the ELBO replies on the bayesian network for the generating process to be either $\\eta -> x^{(0)} -> x^{(1)} ... -> x^{(T)}$ or $\\eta <- x^{(0)} <- x^{(1)} ... <- x^{(T)}$, which is also unjustifiable to me.\n\nThe motivation for using diffusion model is also very doubtful. It is very unclear to me why one would use it to diffuse covariates vector, which in most real-world cases aren't even fully continuous, let alone having Gaussian noises, and in some case aren't even available in high-dimension. The simulation cases you proposed aren't really realistic to me for that reason. Although it is mentioned in one sentence in the introduction, it's still very much unclear to me why diffusion model is preferred over an VAE approach and why the assumption that the covariates are generated from a denoising process is preffered over no assumption.\n\nIn a bigger picture, on the scope of missing data imputation, prior work [1] has already proposed using diffusion model to impute missing data, and has advanced the \"impute-then-generate\" framework you're using to directly account for the uncertainty\nof missing data in the learning process, and the drawback of \"impute-then-generate\" framework was illustrated.\n\nOverall, the contribution of this paper is flawed and unsubstantial in my opinion.\n\n[1] Ouyang, Yidong, et al. \"MissDiff: Training Diffusion Models on Tabular Data with Missing Values.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.00467 (2023)."

                "value": "1. Could the authors elaborate on why diffusion model is preferred over an VAE approach for covariates imputation? In the introduction, you said VAE \"could restrict the model\u2019s flexibility\". How is making less assumptions restricting model's flexibility? Isn't that the opposite?\n\n2. What value does Theorem 1. add to the paper really? If there's any part of the proposed method that aids to identifiability or true latent recovery, please elaborate.\n\nMisc.:\nLine 3 of Eq 20: missing negative sign."
