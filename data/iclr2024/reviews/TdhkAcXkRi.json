Then, the local clients embed the global gradient information into the local updating steps as a momentum item.\n\nThe strategy is simple and straightforward, just as the title highlighted. Particularly, this work gives detailed proof to validate the effectiveness of the simple strategy, which is appreciated (but with some mistakes).

Please check the following Questions 2 and 4.\n\n3.\tThe problem complexity is studied over the convergence rate under the same fixed hardware budget, such as communication cost or memory consumption. However, this work forgets to mention the extra requirement over the communication budget or the local storage.\n(a)\tFirstly, the costs of the downlink communication may be two times more expensive than other methods since the proposed method requires the broadcast of the extra averaged gradient information from the center server to each client, together with the new model parameters.\n(b)\tIf the algorithm tries to maintain the same communication cost, then it can only broadcast the averaged gradient information. But it will require the local client to save a copy of the initial parameters of (r-1)-step, i.e., transferring the global updating step to local clients.\n\n4.\tDespite the doubt about proof, the method itself is not novel. Embedding local or global momentum seems straightforward. Meanwhile, considering the broad application scenarios of FL, the experiment is too simple, which is not valid to show the effectiveness of the method.

I.e., without the popular bounded data heterogeneity assumption, how the local gradient information contribute to the global convergence? Can you briefly explain it?\n\n2.\tThe second question is independent but may be correlated with the first one. I checked the proof of Theorem 1 (Theorem 11 in the Appendix), and the building of the above relation can track the source back to Lemma 5. However, the very second inequality of the proof of Lemma 5 (Page-14), which builds the above relationship, seems to be wrong to me. Considering the updating step is x^{r+1} = x^{r} \u2013 \u03b3g^{r+1}, the item \u2212\u03b3||\u2207f(x^{r})||2 comes out from nowhere, and the sign of the item \u03b3\u27e8\u2207f(x^{r}),g^{r+1}\u27e9 should be negative, and it is the real descent item.\nThen, without Lemma 5, the most important result in this work, Theorem 1, may be wrong.\n\n3.\tThis work uses Young\u2019s inequality four times (Page 14, 17, 22 and 25), but actually, I am not really sure how to get the derived inequality by applying Young\u2019s inequality each time. Please elaborate on each one.\n\n4.\tThis question is correlated with the Question 1 and 3. Basically, each time when you use the Young\u2019s inequality, you will use the relation, E||x^{r} \u2013 x{r\u22121}||^2 <= \u03b3^{2}E(\u03be_{r-1} + E||\u2207f(x^{r-1})||^{2}) in next step, for example, it has been used to derive the second inequality in Page 22.\nIt is not true to me without any assumptions. Basically, you are saying the averaged gradient can be bounded by the true gradient with some error, this is basically a (new) variant assumption of the assumption you claim you have abandoned (bounded data heterogeneity assumption). I believe you should not abandon the more standard bounded data heterogeneity assumption.\n\n5.\tI checked the mentioned work VRL-SGD that can handle unbounded data heterogeneity. It is not published, and the soundness of the proof is being doubted in the previously peer-reviewing stage. You should be careful to present the conclusions of VRL-SGD as formal results in your work."

                "value": "This paper focuses on the FedAvg and SCAFFOLD algorithm in federated learning. In literature, many works that analyze the performance of these two algorithms have to rely on bounded heterogeneity assumptions, which is unrealistic. In this works, momentum methods is employed to solve the data heterogeneity issue in federated learning. Without any other modification on Fedavg and SCAFFOLD, plain SGD with momentum updates can achieve similar convergence rate as literature. Furthermore, this work show that in the setting of partial client participation, momentum update can accelerate convergence."

            "strengths": {
                "value": "1. This work overcomes one of the most common problem in FL analysis, the data heterogeneity issue. Although a lot of works in literature analyzes the convergence result of the two algorithm, most of the works have bounded heterogeneity assumptions. This is the most basic problem in FL analysis. This work utilizes momentum method to overcome the difficulty.\n2. The experiment result is encouraging and directly validate the theory."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The major concern is novelty. FedAvg and SCALFFOLD are well-known methods in FL. Momentum method is also a popular optimization algorithm. Thus the algorithm design lacks novelty. Further, some work has analyzed the performance of FedAvg with Adam update, e.g, Reddi, Sashank, et al. \"Adaptive federated optimization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.00295 (2020). Adam algorithm is closely related to SGD with momentum, thus the proposed analysis lacks novelty."
