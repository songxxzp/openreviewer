                "value": "The paper considers iterative methods to determine Nash equilibria in finite, non-cooperative games. To avoid cycles of best responses, e.g., as is the case with myopic best response in Rock-Paper-Scissors, current state-of-the-art iterative methods like PSRO calculate best responses against all previous policies. This is effective in avoiding cycles, leading ultimately to learning a Nash equilibrium, however, it has a considerable (and often forbidding) increase in computational time by continuously increasing the opponent's self-play population of policies. \n\nWith the aim to improve the self-play algorithm complexity, the paper proposes the idea that when such iterative algorithms enter a cycle, then this cycle must be the support of a mixed Nash equilibrium. It provides a rigorous proof that a complete cyclical set is necessary and sufficient to form the support of a Nash equilibrium. This implies that myopic algorithms, like AlphaZero, can in fact learn the support of a Nash equilibrium when they enter a cycle (or of course, learn a pure Nash equilibrium). Based on this intuition, the paper proposes a self-play algorithm, called GraphNES, that exploits the graph-search dynamics of the above formulation to either stop at a pure Nash equilibrium or to identify that it has entered a cycle. Empirical evaluations on Connect4 and Naruto Mobile suggest improved performance over baselines."

Also, some abrreviations are not defined, e.g., \"is guaranteed by DO\" and some definitions are not rigorous enough, e.g., \"previous strategy\" in a cyclical set or whether the paper only considers symmetric games (as indicated in some parts of the analysis).\n- The finding of Theorem 3.1 is not surprising to me and it seems that it at least anecdotally known in the literature. Also, the paper seems to ignore a lot of papers on the average case performance of best response dynamics that have related results.\n- The title does not seem representative of the context of the paper. Chaos does not seem to be relevant - and many recent studies on chaos are not referenced/acknowledged.\n- Some claims seem to be poorly justified. E.g., why does \"This allows us to represent the learning representation of an equilibrium point in noncooperative games as a directed graph search\" (see Intro) or why \"This aligns with Zermelo\u2019s Theorem, providing theoretical validation.\" or \"Hence, the learning representation of a noncooperative game as a graph provides a theoretical guarantee to\nfind a NE.\"\n- Figure 2 is hard/impossible to parse due to the small font, but even then, I don't understand what do the numbers represent.\n- The complexity of the proposed algorithm is not discussed and in particular, the problem of scaling this algorithm, is mentioned in the limitations of the paper. Thus, the paper provides only low-dimensional experiments. But this is precisely the problem that the algorithm was seeking to solve, to my understanding."

The authors never for example try to even hint at whether they mean Li-Yorke chaos, Lyapunov chaos, Devaney Chaos, etc. In fact the paper seems to be about best-response dynamics.\n\n2. Reading through the intro and even up to and including the main theorem statement I still do not know what the paper has actually showed.\n\n3. The definition of cyclical best response strategies which appears in theorem 1, while being undefined, is still not properly defined. The definition that follows the theorem is referring to an optimal strategy of the opponents (-i). Optimal to what? Is this meant to apply to a zero-sum games? If not, to which strategy of the agent i is this to meant to an optimal response. Also, pease do not use notation of the form \\sigma^{i}_{*'}. Those indices are very hard to read.\n\n4. Does theorem 1 refers to two players games or n-player games? Is it about zero-sum games as many of the examples suggest but in the  game theory basics we have definition for n player games.\n\nI believe that the could be some interesting statement made here, but this paper needs some thorough work before it is ready to published."

Drawing a line from the early observations of cyclic patterns in strategies, such as those seen in Shapley's polygons, through to the formal predictions of the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem, the paper successfully situates its findings within a historical context of strategic analysis. The assertion that the detection of cycling within Path-Response Strategy Oscillations (PRSO) dynamics is tantamount to discovering the support strategies of a Mixed Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) is a significant one. This claim underscores the potential of cycle detection not only as a diagnostic tool for understanding strategic behaviors in games but also as a means to unearth the foundational structures that underpin MSNEs. The result, therefore, is not just a reflection of dynamic behavior in games but also a powerful statement about the nature of equilibrium within the strategic play."

However, this raises a significant question about the computational tractability of Nash Equilibrium. The paper should address why cycle detection is presented as an easy task and not as evidence that finding a Nash Equilibrium is tractable. It would be beneficial for the authors to delineate the aspects of their cycle detection methodology that may incur exponential time, which would then align with the conventional complexity understanding of Nash Equilibria.\n\nIf this is not the case, how did we avoid PPAD-hardness of the result?\n\n2) \n\nNovelty of the Result: The paper's results, while compelling, do not seem novel in the light of existing research. The concept of cycling and instability of Nash equilibria has been addressed in several key papers, such as \"Nash, Conley, and Computation: Impossibility and Incompleteness in Game Dynamics\" by Milionis et al., 2022, and \"No-regret learning and mixed Nash equilibria: They do not mix\" by Vlatakis-Gkaragkounis et al., 2020. Furthermore, \"Cycles in adversarial regularized learning\" by Mertikopoulos et al., 2018, touches upon similar themes within FTRL dynamics, which are akin to BR-dynamics with a strong convex regularizer. \nFor a discrete example see section 4.5 of Vlatakis-Gkaragkounis et al., 2020. The authors cite also books where preliminary results are already known in the literature for simpler dynamics.\nVaguely speaking, current literature actually is far ahead from proving simply cycles by giving understanding also the econometric impact of them: Papers like \"On the Interplay between Social Welfare and Tractability of Equilibria\" by Anagnostides and Sandholm discuss the outcomes of non-converging gradient descent methods, which  form a cycle and explain the impact of cycle in PoA  results. \n\nMoreover, going to the core of the problem, Milionis et al, their predecessors and follow-up  works such as \"The Replicator Dynamic, Chain Components and the Response Graph\" by Biggar and Shames, and E. Akin's \"Domination or Equilibrium\" (1980), have already discussed the elements of strongly connected component (aka a  ``generic'' cycle) of best response dynamics includes the support of a Mixed  Nash state.\n\nIt is essential for the review committee to consider the depth of related literature on this topic, potentially uncovering more foundational results which covers also exactly PRSO dynamics. Although the age of a result does not undermine its relevance, it does affect the suitability of the work for a conference setting, as opposed to a journal that might better accommodate such ``slight'' rediscoveries.\n\nGiven these considerations, I recommend that the paper be accepted on the condition of a significant expansion of the related work section. This expansion should not only acknowledge the depth of existing research but also elucidate the specific differences in the dynamics studied by the paper that add to its merit. A more in-depth comparison with the broader body of literature will greatly enhance the paper's contribution and ensure a thorough understanding of where it stands in the context of existing knowledge."

                "value": "Empirical game theory methods such as Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO) aim to compute a Nash equilibrium in normal-form games by iteratively solving for the equilibrium of a consistently growing game. Such algorithms often exhibit cycling behavior over a set of action profiles. The authors show that the action profiles over which these algorithms cycle form the support of the set of mixed Nash equilibria. This results enables a novel graph search learning representation of self-play that finds an NE as a graph search. The authors demonstrate in experiment that their method is efficient in discovering Nash equilibria in normal-form games such as Connect4 and Naruto Mobile."
