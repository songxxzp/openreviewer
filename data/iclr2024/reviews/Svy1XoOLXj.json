It is suggested that (2) results in overfitting, and the main idea behind the proposed BiLoRA is to train singular values and vectors on a different partition of the training set."

Without any evidence on the alleged limitations of AdaLoRA, it is unclear what advantages the bi-level optimization approach brings. \n* Although the main methodological difference with AdaLoRA is the bi-level optimization approah, the paper doesn't really experiment with the associated hyper-parameters. How is the number of iterations for singular value/vector updates found? Does this result in large performance/training-time differences? If the results are robust to the choice of $T_1$ and $T_2$, why not alternate between the two, i.e. $T_1 = T_2 = 1$? How does the dataset partition (choice of data on which singular values and singular vectors are trained on) affect the performance and training times?"
