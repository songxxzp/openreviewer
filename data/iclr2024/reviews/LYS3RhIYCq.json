Such work is a complement to the current RL/IL community.\n\n2. The empirical study presented in this paper is thorough with an extensive amount of experiments, and the result clearly supports the claim that the performance of IL scales smoothly with computational budget and number of parameters.\n\n3. The paper is well-written, with a clear discussion on limitations (reward as metrics could be non-smooth, hyperparameters are not tuned for each profile), possible future directions, ethics statement and reproducibility statement, and implementation details carefully listed.

The experiment results first show a clear power-law of the optimal model size, data size, and MLE loss with respect to the compute budget. Then this paper considers the metric of policy return and the empirical results show a similar conclusion. Finally, this paper uses the law obtained early to predict the optimal model size and data size required to achieve the expert policy. They train NetHack agents with the predicted optimal model size and data size and find they outperform prior state-of-the-art by 2x in all settings."

                "value": "This paper studies scaling laws in the setting of imitation learning. That is, it searches for relationships that are linear on a log-log plot of the following quantities: compute (FLOPS) & #parameters & amount of data vs. cross entropy loss & reward.\n\nWhilst such laws are widely studied in supervised learning in various domains, this is the first work in the imitation learning setting, which is the major novelty of the paper.\n\nThe paper argues that such scaling laws do exist in several environments -- several Atari games and the more complex Nethack environment. They follow two established fitting procedures to define coefficients. Data for all experiments is generated by a single expert policy (PPO agents for Atari, and a scripted agent for Nethack). Actions are discrete, and optimized via cross-entropy.\n\nThe paper uses their laws to predict / extrapolate the ingredients for a model that should recover expert performance in Nethack, though the resulting agent falls below that level.\n\nThey offer a brief experiment using online RL (rather than imitation learning), and present scaling laws also discovered in that regime on reward."

                "value": "- The objective of the paper -- studying scaling laws in BC -- is timely and I'm sure would capture the interest of many researchers in and around imitation learning.\n- The paper presents a suite of experiments, and subsequent analysis, that required substantial effort to set up, and significant compute to run. I see value in sharing this with other researchers.\n- Presentation is mostly clear. The main results, particularly Figure 1, come out very clean.\n- The paper offers something of a counter-opinion to the recent work of Hilton et al.."

                "value": "I see several red flags in the paper -- both in the framing of the paper and the experimental design. These are severe enough that I wouldn't recommend acceptance at this time.\n\nMajor -- framing\n- A casual reader could be led by the framing of the paper to believe that scaling laws hold generally across imitation learning. However, a more critical read leaves one with the impression the authors set out deliberately to uncover environments with relationships that could be classified as scaling laws in imitation learning. At its core that is the main issue with the paper -- rather than being a scientific investigation of these properties, it is a biased search for results that fit the scaling-law template.\n- There are fundamental reasons to expect that such laws regarding rewards would _not_ hold generally across imitation learning -- as was the focus of Hilton et al.. Indeed there is the straightforward issue of saturation at the expert's return level, clearly seen in Figure 2's Atari curves, which invalidates any scaling laws beyond a point. There is only brief mention of this in the limitation section.\n\nMajor -- experiment design\n- The authors mention that environments that do not fit the story of the paper are excluded -- Double dunk proved too simple an environment -- and games that were selected were picked due to intuitions that their score would lead to scaling laws. This drastically reduces any conclusions that can be drawn from the paper -- it shows only there exist _some_ environments where scaling laws hold for _some_ portion of the compute space.\n- As I understood, learning rates were held fixed, both across and within model sizes. This has been shown to be a critically important detail in other works -- Hoffmann et al., Hilton et al.. Justification for this requires more than a small note in the limitations section.\n- The true test of scaling laws is their ability to predict properties of models orders of magnitude larger than what coefficients have been fitted for. I'm pleased the authors were brave enough to take on such a test and share results. Unfortunately, the forecasted Nethack model delivered a return of 4x smaller than it was forecast, discrediting the accuracy of these scaling laws.\n\n\nOther issues\n- The RL portion of the paper is distracting and tangential to the main message of the paper.\n- The model sizes in Atari are very small (1k to 5M params) -- it feels a little incongruous given work around scaling laws is motivated to help understand very large models.\n- Model scaling was done by changing the LSTM and CNN width only. Is it not important to proportionally scale depth?\n- Data was generated by a single expert algorithmic policy per environment. Whilst this is a common set up for RL benchmarks, it is far more restrictive than work on scaling laws in other domains, such as language, which are fitting data from a broad distribution of demonstrators."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- See major issues within weaknesses.\n- One thought that occurred to me -- scaling laws require a decomposition of reducible and irreducible error. Usually it is intractable to estimate the irreducible error in domains like language, but it would be possible in imitation learning with a fixed policy. Might this add depth to the analysis?"
