It is worth noting that a slight compromise in performance metrics can lead to a significant reduction in model complexity. Therefore, the claim of computational optimization in the abstract, which states a 64.4% reduction in computational complexity at the cost of 9.8% of SI-SNRi for the PP variant, and a 41.9% reduction at the cost of 7.70% SI-SNRi with the FP variant, may not be entirely convincing, as similar results might be achievable by simply reducing the model size without necessarily relying on the SOI method.\nA more fair comparison should be made on the same performance level with different complexities or the same complexity level with different performances. From the experiments, I did not see a significant advantage of the SOI method compared to STMC in this regard."
