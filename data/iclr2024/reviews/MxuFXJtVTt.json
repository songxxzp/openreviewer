This approach proposes to use a temperature\nparameter in the softmax to control the diversity of responses. The work is showcased on discrete prompts."

The paper builds directly on the recent work by Duan et al. 2023 [1] and proposes a very limited extension. \nMoreover, it incorrectly states the method from the previous work [1]. Namely, this submission states that [1] \"it requires a source of unlabeled non-private training examples to facilitate the knowledge transfer to the student\". It is incorrect, [1] in Table 2 studies two settings, (IID Transfer) when the public dataset is from the same and (OOD Transfer) different distribution than the private training data. Moreover, [1] selects which tokens are taken into account as labels and is flexible in the selection of these tokens for the labels. \n2. The main contribution is not related to the prompts. \"The aggregation method should preserve privacy but to facilitate the knowledge transfer from teachers to the student, should critically also preserve the diversity of the teacher distributions. Our primary technical challenge was to formalize this requirement and design an aggregation method with a good privacy utility tradeoff.\" If this is the main contribution the hot PATE can be used for any task, not only for the discrete prompts. \n3. It is not true that PATE was used only for the classification tasks. The submission claims: \"Until now, PATE has primarily been explored with classification-like tasks, where each example possesses a ground-truth label, and knowledge is transferred to the student by labeling random examples.\" Many follow-ups for PATE consider, e.g., image generation: G-PATE https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/171ae1bbb81475eb96287dd78565b38b-Abstract.html \"G-PATE: Scalable Differentially Private Data Generator via Private Aggregation of Teacher Discriminators\" [2]\n\nAdditional comments:\n- \"utility must deteriorates with the diversity of teacher distributions.\" -> must deteriorate\n\n\n\n** References: **\n[1] Haonan Duan, Adam Dziedzic, Nicolas Papernot, and Franziska Boenisch. \"Flocks of stochastic parrots: Differentially private prompt learning for large language models.\" NeurIPS 2023.\n[2] Yunhui Long, Boxin Wang, Zhuolin Yang, Bhavya Kailkhura, Aston Zhang, Carl Gunter, Bo Li. \"G-PATE: Scalable Differentially Private Data Generator via Private Aggregation of Teacher Discriminators.\" NeurIPS 2021."

In its current state, I believe the submission needs more work to meet the (writing) standards expected for an ICLR paper.\n\n- The scope and contribution of this submission seems not clearly stated. Initially, the paper appears to claim a general extension of the PATE framework, but the method and experiment sections mainly focus on prompt learning. A clearer definition of the scope is needed for an accurate evaluation of the submission. Furthermore, since the distillation formulation (which aggregates distributions as this submission intends to do) was briefly discussed in the original PATE paper [1] (Appendix B.1), it's crucial to articulate the novelty and insights of this work in comparison to that prior research.\n\n[1] \"Semi-supervised knowledge transfer for deep learning from private training data\", ICLR 2017"

Specifically, it might be helpful to check the consistent and proper use of hyphens and to verify the correct application of \\citet and \\citep. Some sentences could benefit from rephrasing for clarity. Below are a few examples from the submission that need further clarification: \n  - Diversity and privacy appear to be conflicting in that DP requires that the output token is supported\nby sufficiently many teachers, a \u201creporting threshold\u201d that depends on the privacy parameter values.\n  - Therefore, low probability across many teachers is something we care to transfer whereas high\nprobability in few teachers, the \u201cbad case\u201d for privacy, is also not something we need to transfer.\n  - A tokens j that broadly has a low probability q will appear, sometimes, with very high\nfrequency cj that does not depend on q. What does depend on q is the probability of this event. This allows it to pass through a high \u201cprivacy threshold.\u201d\n\n- Some \"minor\" points regarding Definition 1:\n  - Missing left-bracket for $f(p^{(i)})_{i\\in[n]})$  \n  - The notation $j\\in V$ might not be rigorous. Perhaps $j$ should denote the *index* for words in $V$.\n  - Why is the dependence on $\\tau$ completely not reflected in the example shown on page 4"
