However, the baselines are evaluated on different variants of the initial neural networks (e.g. different number of parameters, etc.) and hence are not really comparable. Besides, the baselines achieve typically much higher (absolute) accuracy, but as as just said they are not really comparable.\n\nOverall, the fact that Ramanujan graphs were already used for pruning (Hoang et al ICLR 2023) makes this contribution rather iterative (going from random Ramanujan graphs to deterministic ones). I am willing to change my score if authors / other reviewers address my concerns and convince me of the significance of the contribution.\n\nMinor comments:\n* Wrong use of \\citep vs \\citet (e.g.\"[..] data independent contexts Cheng et al. (2023)\" must be (Cheng et al., 2023) and many more such examples)\n* Perhaps typo in title \"Neural Architecture**s**\"?"
