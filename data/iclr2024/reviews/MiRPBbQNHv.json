A better approach would be to release the code for the community to experiment with, rather than creating a dataset that doesn't seem to add much to the field.\n- If we interpret peripheral image transformation via TTM as a form of image perturbation, results are unsurprising. The observation that models perform poorly on shifted domains (in this case, TTM generated images) and become more robust after training on the new domain (COCO-Periph) is not surprising. The results are, in essence, not only predictable but do not provide an insight on periphearl vision. To be clear: the exact same results could have be obtain with ANY image transformation resulting in a domain shift.\n- The paper fails to provide a clear explanation for why the proposed model, even after fine-tuning on the entire dataset, still performs significantly worse than DINO. This raises questions about the efficacy of the proposed model and whether it addresses the problem of peripheral vision adequately.\n- Figure 5, which assesses the model's resilience, is presented misleadingly. It only demonstrates the model's performance across various eccentricities, which is expected, given that the model was trained on the same data. Still, as we see from Table 1, the proposed finetuned approach performs worse than DINO. It would be interesting to see absolute performance on 20 degs, for DINO and the proposed model (I imagine, that would not show any advantage)\n- The paper includes an experiment comparing humans presented with objects at different eccentricities with a model presented with a uniform peripheral transformation obtained with TTM. This comparison is not fair. This essentially tests the model on out-of-distribution data, making the poor performance of the models obvious. In no way I see a support for any conclusions regarding properties of the peripheral vision. \n- The paper lacks a clear explanation of the practical importance of a peripheral vision model. The only advantage seems to be an increase in robustness for very related image transformations..."

My concern revolves around potential artifacts that could have been introduced during the experiments, possibly influencing the outcomes.\n\nWhile previous results seem to corroborate a substantial match with human performance, it's crucial to note that the stimuli utilized in their study differ in certain aspects from those in previous research, such as the grayscale images presented in Ehinger & Rosenholtz (2016). Additionally, there seems to be a noticeable discrepancy in the texture quality of the images.\n\nAs well, although data-based solutions seems to shorten the distance  between CNNs and human performance,  I am eager to learn about the authors' insights and opinions regarding the fundamental mechanisms absent in CNNs but present in humans, which might account for these observed disparities. What specific aspects of human cognition and perception do the authors believe are not adequately captured by current CNN models, and how might future research bridge this gap to enhance the performance of computer vision systems?"

The paper generates a new dataset, COCO-Periph, which is MS COCO processed through the TTM at different eccentricities. Humans performed a forced-choice object detection experiment, viewing the target object location at various eccentricities. Human accuracy was high well into the periphery (out to the 20 deg tested). Object detection models performing the same task using the TTM synthesised images showed performance drops to chance that occurred at smaller eccentricities than humans. Training on COCO-Periph raised this somewhat, but still not to human performance. The paper also presents some mixed results on noise robustness. The conclusions are that (1) the tested models are insufficient to match human peripheral performance (2) future model architectures should try to close this gap and (3) the COCO-Periph dataset is a valuable benchmark for achieving this."

                "value": "### An alternative explanation for the results is that the TTM is an inadequate model of human peripheral vision \n\nIf the TTM discards more information than the human visual system in fact preserves, then we would expect this pattern of results: humans have better performance out to larger eccentricities than DNNs trained on COCO-Periph. This is not because of the model architecture, but because the COCO-Periph training set distorts images too much. If this were the case, then closing the gap between human and machine peripheral vision may not be about testing more advanced model architectures, but about finding a better representation for human peripheral vision.\n\nThe paper currently gives the impression that the TTM and related approaches have unequivocal support as a model of human peripheral vision:\n\n> Humans viewing these transformed images perform visual tasks with an accuracy that well predicts human performance while fixating the original images\n\n> This model has been tested to well predict human performance on an extensive number of behavioral tasks, including peripheral object recognition, visual search, and a variety of scene perception tasks\n\n> rendered images that capture the amount of information available to humans at (5\u25e6, 10\u25e6, 15\u25e6, 20\u25e6)\n\n> previous work demonstrated that TTM is a close match to human peripheral vision (Ehinger & Rosenholtz, 2016), so differences in performance cannot be explained by stimuli alone.\n\nHowever, there is other work that would rather seem to support the alternative explanation above [refs 3, 4, 5, 6]. \nUnder some circumstances, humans are more sensitive to image distortions than predicted by these texture models.\nWhile there are undoubtedly tasks for which TTM does correlate well with human performance (e.g. visual search, scene gist recognition, etc), object detection as tested here may not be one of them.\nIndeed, it is generally considered that crowding is about discrimination, not detection. \nIf the present paper had instead used an object discrimination task then the correlation between human and TTM-trained-DNNs might be much higher.\nIn any case, it remains uncertain whether the \"gap in performance between humans and computer vision DNNs in the periphery\" can or should be addressed through the development of more advanced DNN architectures and training on COCO-Periph (e.g. \"In future, it would be interesting to train and evaluate transformer based- architectures.\"). \nRather, the adequacy of the TTM as a model of the human periphery for this specific purpose remains an open question.\n\n### A more comprehensive description of the TTM should be provided\n\nThe paper lacks a comprehensive description of what the Texture Tiling Model (TTM) computes, which hinders a clear understanding of its workings. \nThe reference given for the original TTM is Rosenholtz et al., 2012a (e.g. Figure 8 caption). \nThat paper also does not contain a detailed description of what the TTM actually computes, that would be sufficient to re-implement the model.\nIt is also unclear whether the authors intend to release the TTM code, as the paper mentions the public release of the COCO-Periph dataset \"along with all analysis code\" but doesn't specify whether this includes the TTM.\nFor a more in-depth understanding of the TTM's summary statistics, reference to Portilla and Simoncelli (2000) is necessary, although this reference is absent from the paper and should be included.\n\n### Data analysis and quantification\n\nThe absence of uncertainty indications in the data plots is a noticeable shortcoming. \nAccuracies and psychometric function parameter estimates (Figure 3c, 5, 6, etc) should give indications of uncertainty in the data and parameter estimates (e.g. confidence intervals). \nAre the psychometric function parameters estimated from all human data pooled? \nFor each participant individually? \nOtherwise it's hard to evaluate the precision of the data.\n\nFor instance, Figure 5 shows human criticial eccentricity $\\mu$ values of around 22. \nHowever, if this is a fit to the accuracy data in Figure 3c (as it seems to be) then this value seems implausible: the psychometric function threshold is likely far higher. \nThis point seems to be supported by the fact that the two images that were removed (A. 3.4, Figure 13) appear to show basically no eccentricity effect -- including these images would further support a far higher $\\mu$ value.\n\nMoreover, the step size of TTM eccentricities might be insufficient to offer robust constraints on the model's $\\mu$ values. \nFigure 3c illustrates multiple almost-equally-plausible psychometric curves that could be drawn between the relevant points of DINO FocalNet, potentially altering the $\\mu$ estimates. These issues highlight the importance of disclosing uncertainty in parameter estimates, making it difficult to evaluate the improvement gained from training or fine-tuning on COCO-Periph.\n\n\n### References\n\n\n[3] T.
