Their method has two stages. First, train a deep neural network (DNN) to classify sleep stages jointly with a linear projector which projects the DNN embeddings (penultimate layer) into a pre-defined feature space. These features are hand-extracted and clinically motivated for sleep stage definition. In the second stage, an interpretable model (boosted trees here), is trained on the projection from the DNN embeddings onto the clinical features space. Because embedding's projections are aligned with clinical features, the authors propose to interpret them as so making their model directly interpretable w.r.t to clinical features importance."

Also, the effort in terms of experiment is significant. Below is a detailed assessment of the strength of the paper:\n\n### Relevance of the task\n\nAs noted by the authors, interpretability and explainability are key to the acceptance of ML by clinicians. The authors do a great job of motivating the problem and highlighting the gap between interpretable models based on clinical features and black-box or non-clinically relevant models. \n\n\n### Experiments\nThe authors made a great effort to consider two datasets and many baselines. In particular, they made the effort to adapt possible baselines to their framework to have a more fair comparison. The results in terms of performance clearly show what the authors wanted to highlight, a trade-off between the clinical feature-based model and DL. Given it is valid, (see weakness below) the interpretability section is a very nice addition."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "### Questioning concerning the interpretability of the model \nThe authors learn a linear projector from DNN embeddings onto (a scaled version of) a set of features and they use these projections, as if they were the features themselves, to train a glass-box classifier. In that way, they hope to achieve better performance than training directly on the features.\n\nFor me, this is problematic from an interpretability point of view. Indeed, if the linear model can perfectly regress the features, then training on the projection or the features is strictly equivalent. In that case, interpreting the projections as the features themselves is fine, as they are identical. However, the performance is also identical, thus less good than the black-box models. On the other hand, as the regression error increases between features and projections, the downstream performance might diverge (in a positive way) as well. However, the more projections and features diverge, the less one can assume to interpret them as if they were the features themselves. \n\nThus, I believe the method to be ill-posed, as improved performance can only be achieved at the cost of guarantees in terms of interpretability. \n\n\n### Clarity\nThe second main weakness of this work is the overall clarity in my opinion. After carefully reading both the main body and supplementary, I found the paper to still be quite hard to understand. Here are some examples:\n- The ordering of sections, hurts the reading with typically the second section being a presentation of the data, before even knowing about the task or method of interest. \n- The choice of the term \"epoch\" to refer to a 30s segment of sleep recording which is highly confusing with the term referring to a full pass on a dataset when training a neural network.\n- The definition of a new metric where terms are not properly defined. What does alignment between nodes and domain knowledge mean?\n- The authors refer to \"glass-box models\" throughout the paper without defining it. I understand it's a common terminology in interpretability but it should be defined. \n\n### Lack of related work \nLinking to the lack of clarity, I believe the absence of related work is both a limitation for putting the work in the context of the field and also for the clarity itself.  \nTypically, clear links exist in this work with the ideas of partial concept bottleneck models, which aim to create a similar trade-off between performance and maintaining concept-level interpretability. \n\n### Other issues\n- No confidence interval for the experiments\n- The authors did not always bold the best method in their results\n\n## Conclusion\nIf this work tackles a highly relevant problem in the field of clinical ML, closing performance on black-box model while preserving interpretable models, the limitations of the proposed method in terms of guarantee for interoperability as well as the lack of clarity and related work push me to recommend rejection. Because I had a hard time understanding parts of the manuscript, some of my concerns may be in fact caused by my lack of understanding and not justified, hence my lower confidence score."

Indeed, it feels to me that, by construction, NormIntSleep features are similar to those used in the alignment metric, when FeatLong features are not. I might not understand what the alignment metric actually measures, which is also a problem in this paper.\n- code to reproduce presented experiments is missing\n\nHere is a more precise list of comments, suggestions and quick questions:\n- in my opinion, Figure 1 could be clearer. In particular, I think panel A should help the reader understand that there are multiple steps represented (step 1: fit DNN, step 2: extract and normalise domain features, step 3: fit linear mapping between latent representation from DNN and domain features). Moreover, I find it misleading to use the boxes \"embeddings\" and \"normalization\" as inputs of the box \"optimization\". Finally, you could already add notations at this stage (for $T$, $F$, $E$, etc). Generally, it is not clear to me what the colour code used for boxes represents.\n- although I find this paper generally well written, the overall layout feels a bit dense. In my opinion, Algorithm 1 and 2 are mildly informative and take a lot of space: maybe they could be moved to the appendix. I have a similar feeling about Fig1.c\n\t- As a side note, in algorithm 2 line 9, what is $R'$ compared to $R$? Similar question for $T'$ in algorithm 1\n- equation 1: to me, a clear definition of what it means for a node to be \"aligned with clinical domain knowledge\" is still needed at this stage, otherwise the overall definition of the alignment metric feels very circular. In particular, do you use the threshold value to determine if a node is aligned? Moreover, it feels to me that this notation should specify what nodes are compared to (in this case, I guess it would be the AASM Manual, but details feel hazy to me)\n- results are reported without standard error to the mean, so in my opinion it is hard to assess which approach is performing the best\n- Table 3: I think this table would be easier to read if names of interpretable methods were split in two columns (features and glass-box model)"

Can you comment on why you think this is possible? My concern is that, if the linear projector had perfect accuracy when reconstructing features, there should not be any difference of sleep-stage decoding performance between models trained on ground-truth features and predicted features. Could it be that your framework somewhat regularises features from FeatShort in a way that makes them more prone to fitting a glass-box algorithm?\n\t- As a follow-up on this question, I would be very interested to see how a glass-box model trained on ground-truth FeatShort performs on predicted FeatShort (i.e. `NormIntSleep`) and vice-versa. Could you please include these results to better understand what is going on?\n\t- Moreover,  FeatShort-LogisticRegression seems to be missing from Table3, could you please add it?\n- in Figure2: I am wondering what the same figure for a model trained on ground-truth FeatShort features would look like. It feels to me that $\\text{Alignment}_{DT}$ should be very high for this model as well\n- as stated in the \"weaknesses\" section, I have trouble understanding the $\\text{Alignment}_{DT}$ metric ; however, I wonder if it is fair to compare `NormIntSleep` to FeatLong through this metric, given that `NormIntSleep` was built to have features similar to that of what the alignment metric expects. This feels like a form of double-dipping to me. Shouldn't you try to extract a subset of features from FeatLong, train your linear projector on this subset, and then compare alignment values to AASM?"
