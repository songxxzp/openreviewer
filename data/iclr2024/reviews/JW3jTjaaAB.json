                "value": "This paper considers the task of air quality prediction (PM2.5) simultaneously over a network of weather monitoring stations, using wind direction and speed as covariates. This is achieved with the help of an enoder-decoder architecture which can represent past values of the target variables and covariates, including the spatial correlations between the different stations. The encoded structure is used to solve ODEs based on advection and diffusion through a suitably designed Graph Neural Network, which can represent the spatial relations between the different stations. Instead of using computationally expensive Chemical Transport Models (CTM), this physics-based NN model can predict the state at the end of the prediction period (24/48/72 hours) and this is used to generate the final predictions of PM2.5 using decoder. It is shown that the proposed model can perform better than existing NN-based models and traditional statistical models for air quality prediction, including in situations where there is abrupt air quality changes. Some intuition is also provided through a case study, where the pollution hot-spots are found to shift in the direction of winds."

Is it possible to train it on one city and use it on the other? Which parameters will need fine-tuning in that case?\n5) Is the data periodic in nature? How strong is the spatial correlation between the different stations?\n6) Two covariates are considered- wind direction and wind speed. Do the competitor methods also use these? How will the proposed model perform if these covariates are not considered? Or if more covariates are considered?\n7) How are the two \"traditional\" methods - HA and VAR implemented? Specifically, are they done specific to each station separately? If so, it may not be a fair comparison.\n8) How does the proposed approach compare with CTM?"

Experimental results on two real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AirPhyNet over several state-of-the-art baseline models in various forecasting scenarios.

Although the authors briefly explained the difference in Section 2.2, the details are not clearly stated. More discussions would be better.\n2. In Equation 9, the authors claim they adopt a reparametrization trick to derive the hidden representation z_{t_0}. The rationale behind this choice is not fully explained. Why not directly use the final hidden state of GRU as z_{t_0}?\n3. In Section 2.4, the authors mentioned they leverage a decoder to generate the prediction results, but it lacks sufficient explanations. For example, the instantiation of the decoder should be illustrated in the paper. Moreover, the loss function should be formally defined.\n4. Some existing forecasting methods, such as DCRNN and AirFormer used in this paper, can also model the diffusion and advection process to some extent. So, what\u2019s the major advantage of injecting physical principles into machine learning models? More discussions are appreciated.\n5. There are some typos.

This method not only enhances the model's interpretability by tying it to real-world physics but also shows superior performance on real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art models in various test scenarios and reducing prediction errors by up to 10%.

Instead, authors take what other researchers have developed for physics-guided ML in a variety of domains (e.g., physics) and use them for air quality prediction. Therefore, the method appears to be a combination of multiple well known methods with some developments in how to incorporate the specific physics priors for air quality priors. The air quality priors are just new equations and do not pose a significant technical challenge. Therefore, I do not think this is not a significant contribution for ICLR's research track. Perhaps the paper's contribution is better suited to a domain journal or the applied track of an AI conference.\n\n- Liang et al. 2023 (cited by authors in experimental setup) performed experiments in 342 cities in China and data appears publicly available.
