                "value": "The paper has a few limitations which should be better discussed by the authors:\n\n1. First, it only considers natural image data. The statistical properties of images have been intensively in the context of signal processing, and the observation that natural images tend to display a power-law behaviour is much older than neural scaling laws, see e.g. [Ruderman 1997]. The assumption of power-law features is also classical in the study of kernel regression, where it is known as \"*capacity conditions*\" [Caponnetto 2007].\n\n2. Second, the paper focus on the bulk of the sample covariance spectrum. While one does not expect universality beyond the bulk, they play a central role in learning. For instance, consider a $k$-Gaussian mixture data $X = y\\mu^{\\top}+Z$ with means $\\mu\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times k}$ and labels $y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$. In this case, the information about the $k$ modes is on the outliers, and the performance of a classifier trained in this data set will crucially depend on the correlation between the labels and the means. Moreover, the outliers is crucial in feature learning: it has been recently show that for two-layer neural networks a single gradient step away from random initialisation takes precisely the form of a rank one spike that correlate with the labels [Ba et al. 2023]. The neural collapse phenomenon provides a similar observation for deep neural networks [Papyan et al. 2020]."

                "value": "- **[Q1]**: In the abstract, the authors say that:\n> \"*These findings show that with sufficient sample size, the Gram matrix of natural image datasets can be well approximated by a Wishart random matrix with a simple covariance structure, opening the door to rigorous studies of neural network dynamics and generalization which rely on the data Gram matrix.*\"\n\nHowever, how these results open the door to the study of \"*neural networks dynamics and generalization*\" is actually never discussed. In light of my second commend in *Weaknesses* on the relationship between feature learning and generalisation with the outliers, why the authors believe the observation of spectral universality of the bulk is relevant to the study of generalisation?\n\n- **[Q2]**: I miss a discussion on the relationship between these results and error universality, which has been intensively investigated starting from [Mei & Montanari 2022; Gerace et al. 2020; Goldt et al. 2022; Hu, Lu 2023]. Here, one looks directly at the universality of the training and generalisation error instead of the features, taking into account the labels and the task. Although more restrictive, it has been observed to hold for data close to the one studied here [Loureiro et al. 2021]. For a simple regression task, a parallel with the type of universality discussed here can be drawn, since the computation of the error boils down to a RMT problem [Wei et al. 2022]. In particular, it has been noted that in some cases the structure of the bulk fully characterises the error, even for multi-modal distributions, see [Gerace et al. 2023; Pesce et al. 2023]  \n\n\n\n**Minor comments**:\n\n- Although that's ultimately up to the authors, the notation $X_{ia}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times N}$ is unconventional in machine learning.\n\n**References**\n\n- **[Ruderman 1997]** Daniel L.

The local and global eigenvalue statistics used in this paper are standard and can effectively represent the spectral behaviors of the dataset. Potentially this indicates we can use classical random matrix ensembles like GOE ensemble and Poisson ensemble to analyze the spectral properties of deterministic real-world datasets, understand the representation in datasets, and construct certain metrics to measure the quality of datasets. There is another potential motivation for analyzing the eigenstructure of the datasets. In certain cases, we can use synthetic data generation like GANs to create new datasets for training. So understanding the spectral distributions of real-world datasets via correlated Gaussian datasets helps us to further investigate if the synthetic data we generate really captures the useful representation of the data.

This paper analyzes the bulk spectra of real-world datasets by a Gaussian sample covariance matrix whose population covariance is generated by a Toeplitz matrix and power parameter $\\alpha$. The construction of this Toeplitz matrix and $\\alpha$ indicates the correlation among the features of each sample. However, there is no algorithm to find the suitable $\\alpha$ for different datasets. Besides, it would be more informative to have an additional discussion on power law scaling, encoding information in the Gaussian dataset, and the representation learning of the dataset. \n\n2. This paper focuses on bulk eigenvalues but, in machine learning, the outlier eigenvalues and eigenvector statistics are more important for learning. For instance, [1] shows that representations of GAN-data behave as Gaussian mixtures, where spikes in spectra are beneficial for linear classification. As also studied in [2], power-law tails in the spectra may not represent useful features in neural networks but the principal components contain some useful features for learning. There should be some discussion on this here to indicate this power-law scaling is useful for real-world datasets.\n\n3. The authors may need to present additional references in RMT or more detailed proofs for the formula they presented to help readers in the machine learning community better understand the math here. For instance, the claim in (4), formula (11) and (28). Especially, (28) seems to provide the limiting Stieljes transform of correlated Gaussian sample covariance matrix.

In this ensemble, we still have i.i.d. structure but the distribution of each entry may have heavier tails. How do you exclude the case that the real-world datasets are not in this universal class?\n\n2. This paper empirically shows that the bulk eigenvalue distribution of the Gram matrix of the real-world dataset can be mimicked by a correlated Gaussian sample covariance matrix. Does that really mean the synthetic dataset captures useful features in the real dataset? Is it possible to train a neural network separately on both real and synthetic datasets and see if they have similar generalization behaviors? This may provide a better understanding of whether this power law scaling in datasets is useful or not.\n\n3. In the introduction, you claimed that $O(10)$ large eigenvalues are separated from bulk and the rest of bulk eigenvalues have power law. Is this order $O(10)$, in Eq. (3), a constant order or is it related to the number of classes in the dataset? Further quantified analysis may be needed to provide here by increasing the number of samples.\n\n4. If we consider the spectra of different classes in one dataset, like CIFAR10, do they have the power law scaling with the same $\\alpha$ or not in Figure 1? So far, I have not seen a relation between $\\alpha$ and classes in the dataset. Concretely, does the bulk spectrum of the full dataset have the same power-law scaling as the spectrum of the data points in a certain class of this dataset?\n\n5. Eq. (1) looks incorrect. Are $X_{ia} $ entries of the data matrix or a full matrix? You need to make the notions consistent.\n\n6. In Eq. (2), is $\\mathbf{I}_{ij}$ the $(i,j)$ entry of the identity matrix?\n\n7.

The authors motivated the study of Gram matrix using the neural scaling law, but how do the macroscopic and microscopic properties of the eigenvalues (especially the microscopic properties) relate to the power law scaling of learning performance? I cannot find such discussion in the main text. For example. although we know that the universality of eigenvalue spacing distribution can be very robust, it is unclear what insight a machine learning researcher may acquire from such statistics. It would appear that the more important quantity is the Gram matrix of the neural network representation, which has been explored in many recent works including (Seddik et al. 2020) (Wei et al. 2022).   \n* (Wei et al. 2022) More than a toy: random matrix models predict how real-world neural representations generalize.   \n* (Seddik et al. 2020) Random matrix theory proves that deep learning representations of GAN-data behave as Gaussian mixtures. \n\n2. Related to the previous point, it should also be noted that the eigenvalue statistics alone do not decide the learning curve. For trained neural network, the aligned eigenvectors due to representation learning play a major role in the improved generalization performance, as shown in (Ba et al. 2022) (Wang et al. 2023). The authors should comment on whether such eigenvector statistics also fit into the universality perspective in this submission.    \n* (Ba et al. 2022) High-dimensional asymptotics of feature learning: how one gradient step improves the representation.  \n* (Wang et al. 2023) Spectral evolution and invariance in linear-width neural networks. \n\n3.
