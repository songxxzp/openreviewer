For example It would be beneficial if from the experimental results some takeaway message were more explicit provided. In its current shape the paper requires visiting the experimental result section and understanding which specific model or architecture best transfer according to the proposed metric. Given that a significant portion of the paper's contribution is about empirical validation of the proposed transferability metric, this aspect should be improved. This is important as the paper claims \"strong correlation\" both in the abstract and conclusion. \n\nThe paper frequently refers to the \"domain shift\" causing features not to lie on the hypersphere. The implications of this assertion are not clear, and what is meant by it being \"too strict,\" needs clearer elaboration. The paper seems to lack a direct discussion on this. In which way not lying on the hypersphere is related to neural collapse? For instance, could the final classifier bias parameters be disregarded, thereby naturally aligning features with the hypersphere? The connection between domain shift and features not aligning with the hypersphere should be better clarified.\n\nThe metric introduced appears to hold even when training does not proceed until TPT.

Class Fairness term uses intra-class and inter-class covariance, which are also used in Variance Collapse term. But, the relationship between the two terms is not studied enough."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Why does between-class covariance $\\Sigma_B$ in Variance Collapse use global average $h_G$ instead of class average $h_k$? I believe $\\Sigma_B=\\frac{1}{K} \\Sigma_{k_i} \\Sigma_{k_j} (h_{k_i} - h_{k_j})^2 $ would be more correct for the between-class covariance than $h_G$.\n\n- Bhattacharyya coefficient looks similar to Variance Collapse term. Bhattacharyya coefficient is a multiplication between inverse within-class covariance and between-class covariance, while Variance Collapse is a multiplication of within-class covariance and inverse between-class covariance. How about replacing Variance Collapse with inverse Bhattacharyya coefficient for simplicity of formulation?"
