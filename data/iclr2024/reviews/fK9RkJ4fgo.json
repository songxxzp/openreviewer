First the authors introduce a stochastic interpolant with coupling, then it is shown that the density satisfies the transport equation and a loss is derived. Furthermore, in the style of diffusion forward and reverse SDEs are introduced. Then this approach is applied to (class) conditional sampling for instance image superresolution and inpainting."

While I am a huge fan of the idea and the developed theory, I think quantitative experimental evaluation is necessary for acceptance. An appropriate baseline could be the OT coupling flow from Tong et al.  \n\n2) In the proof of Theorem 1, I do not fully understand one step. In equation (23) for the second equality apparently the definition of conditional expectation is used. Please clarify this via some additional justification and the definition of conditional expectation. You kinda have to use that the expected value only depends on (the time derivative) of the stochastic coupling. \n\n3) Is there any intuitive interpretation for the losses like in the diffusion case? \n\n4) It would be nice to see failure cases of  joint learning of time coefficients and score. Since one simultaneously learns the time coefficients $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ .. and the $g$ I am expecting some not so nice local minima when one is not careful with initializing. Did you encounter any of those? Why didnt you use it in the inpainting/superres experiments and decided to fix $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$?\n\n5) In the paper it is discussed, that one needs $\\sigma>0$ in the superresolution experiment. If not one would try to establish a normalizing flow between a lower and a higher dimensional manifold. However when one thinks about the inpainting example filling all the boxes with random (Gaussian) noise could lead to an overestimation of the dimension of the target data, therefore prohibiting \"a true transport equation\" to hold as this defines a normalizing flow. \n\n6) Is it possible to derive the losses from the forward/reverse SDEs so one does not necessarily enforce invertibility?\n\n7) A small nitpick: I think the formulation \"reverse\" SDE is more appropriate since backward has a different meaning in the probability theory context."

In particular, the paper notes that much of the construction can be connected with existing SDE and ODE formulations, all of which depend on the score function ([1] for the straight path ODE that is described in the paper, otherwise the standard OU process). In that case, the conditional methodology would follow from the score function argument as well, implying there would be little difference on the empirical side with existing methodologies. However, the proposed framework does generalize beyond this to other base distributions (for example), so I would expect (or rather, like to see) more empirical emphasis to be placed on this setting.\n* In a similar vein, for the inpainting experiments, there is a big issue in that existing score based methods (e.g. ScoreSDE) can inpaint (up to some approximation error + some necessary hacks) without having to retrain, while the current results come about through retraining.\n* The experiments don't give me that much confidence. In particular, the results are entirely qualitative (meaning they can be easily cherrypicked). For the upsampling experiments, I want to see some numerical comparisons against the standard cascaded diffusion models setup (eg generate 64x64 and upscale to 256x256 to compare FIDs).\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00848"

The derivation of the transport equations in section 2.1, which takes a great portion of the paper, was already done in section 4 of [3] for the unconditional case, where the addition of the conditioning repeats the same derivation with marginalization over the condition. Furthermore, conditioning for super-resolution has been shown in [5] as well as beening widely used in diffusion models (e.g., [4]), and since they can be thought of as particular cases of stochastic interpolants, the addition of conditioning is straightforward. \n   2. Data dependent coupling was already introduced in the context of Flow-Matching [1,2], which is an essentially equivalent framework to stochastic interpolants. \n\nWhile the work provides a coherent, complete formulation of conditional and data-dependent generative modeling in the stochastic interplant framework, I believe the paper needs to be reframed and further emphasize the analogies to existing works and highlight the benefits of formulating these concepts in the stochastic interpolants framework as opposed to for example Flow-matching which already provides the same degrees of flexibility in the design of generative models, or another example, the inpainting application considered in section 3.1 which is equivalent to the setting used in [4] only with a different noise scheduling. \n\n   \n2. **Empirical evaluation** - the empirical evaluation is solely qualitative, which makes it impossible to assess whether there is a benefit in using conditional and data dependent couplings in the stochastic interpolant framework. \n\n\n[1] Pooladian et. al., Multisample Flow Matching: Straightening Flows with Minibatch Couplings (2023)\n\n[2] Tong et. al., Improving and generalizing flow-based generative models with minibatch optimal transport (2023)\n\n[3] Albergo et. al., Stochastic Interpolants: A Unifying Framework for Flows and Diffusions (2023)\n\n[4] Saharia et. al., Palette: Image-to-Image Diffusion Models (2022)\n\n[5].
