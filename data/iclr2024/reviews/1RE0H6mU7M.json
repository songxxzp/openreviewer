They propose three changes to Dreamer-v3, that make it better suited to meta-RL style POMDPs specifically. The changes are training the model on full episodes, scheduling the training horizon length, and adding rewards and timesteps to the observations. They test the proposed model on meta-RL tasks and show that it works well. Additionally, a theoretical result is presented, which shows that decomposable task distributions can enable much lower sub-optimality than non-decomposable task distributions. Using that theoretical result they suggest a simple empirical modification applicable to VariBAD, which achieves better results in the decomposable task distributions. The proposed method naturally enjoys the same benefit."

I would not want you to drop any of the domains already included, but it would make the paper stronger to run the algorithms on something more complex than reacher, which is from the easier end of mujoco tasks.\n- It would be good to run the algorithm on at least some common meta-RL environments to help people who are familiar with that literature to ground the performance. I have no doubt that this works well there but it would be reaffirming to see those results. Consider running this for example in Walker and Humanoid tasks.\n- In the theory section, it is discussed that the local reconstruction could be harmful in high dimensional non-decomposable task distributions. It would have been good to include a demonstration of such failure mode in the experimental section.\n\n## Presentation\n- I found it confusing that the results from the room experiments were discussed in 3.2.2. before the room experiments were described.\n- Figure 2 is very small and busy. Neither 3.2.2 nor the caption contains enough detail to understand what is going on in the figure.\n- The sentence in parenthesis in the first paragraph of 3.2.2 is hard to interpret. Maybe a typo?"

This work leverages this connection to propose a new meta-RL approach based on Dreamer called MAMBA. Compared to Dreamer, MAMBA differs in three ways:\n(1) Like many meta-RL algorithms, MAMBA augments the state with the current timestep and the reward.\n(2) Whereas Dreamer only computes the latent variable over the past 64 steps of the history, MAMBA computes it over the entire past history. This helps in the cases where important information was discovered more than 64 steps ago.\n(3) MAMBA introduces a curriculum where the horizon of the episode is increased over time to help combat the effect where long-range model predictions are inaccurate at the beginning of training.\n\nThis work evaluates MAMBA and finds that it performs favorably compared to VariBAD and Dreamer."

However, they seem fairly sensible and result in fairly good performance gains.\n- Additionally, this work makes interesting connections between model-based RL and VariBAD, and shows that Dreamer can outperform existing meta-RL algorithms.\n\nOverall, this work unproblematically provides several contributions that are interesting to the meta-RL community, so I would be in favor of acceptance."

                "value": "I think this work already provides valuable contributions, but can primarily be strengthened significantly by shedding more light on its results.\n- MAMBA proposes 3 changes over Dreamer. It would be very helpful to perform an ablation study on these 3 changes and understand which ones are most important and how they impact performance.\n- This work finds that Dreamer performs better than VariBAD and HyperX out-of-the-box on meta-RL tasks. I find the paper's claim that this performance gap probably results from architectural differences (VariBAD uses a very simple architecture, whereas Dreamer's is heavily tuned), but it would be interesting to ablate this and understand this better. At face value, non-meta-RL algorithms outperforming meta-RL algorithms on meta-RL tasks is somewhat surprising, and warrants further investigation. Further, it would be worth understanding in what ways these algorithms differ out-of-the-box. Does Dreamer result in better exploration? Or just exploitation? Computing the results in Figure 4 for VariBAD could be very helpful. Additionally, on what sorts of tasks do we expect Dreamer to be better than VariBAD? The tasks in this work take a very particular structure (they decompose nicely into iterated tasks). Is this a structure that clearly benefits one of the algorithms? What happens when this structure is violated?\n- Further analysis of when it's important to predict the whole past + future (as in VariBAD) vs. local reconstruction (as in Dreamer) would be helpful. It's quite believable that local reconstruction could result in better empirical performance due to optimization, though the reason why VariBAD predicts the whole trajectory is as a proxy for predicting a distribution over dynamics, which is intractable. Predicting long-past events could in principle be really important for learning a good representation if some observation explains the dynamics seen early on, though this structure is not present in the current tasks, which may contribute to the conclusions drawn in this work. Some experiments or discussion on this would be helpful.\n- Similarly, discussion about when it is necessary / possible to use the entire past to compute the context variable would be helpful. For really long horizon tasks, rolling out a recurrent policy is simply computationally intractable, so chunking is necessary, e.g., along the lines of R2D2 (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1lyTjAqYX)\n- DREAM (https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02790) reports better exploration than VariBAD on tasks requiring more sophisticated exploration. It \nand subsequent papers (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08802.pdf) also provide more complex tasks. Given the results of Dreamer outperforming VariBAD out-of-the-box, it would be interesting to consider discussion or comparison with DREAM or on these more complex tasks.\n- Despite meta-RL being core to this work, the related works section glosses over a rich literature on meta-RL, including model-based meta-RL e.g., see https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08028, https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06424, https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11347, https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05214\n\nThese open questions are what justify my score of a 6 over an 8."

The example quoted for task decomposability by the authors is a little confusing, the authors  provide an example of a robot being required to solve several independent problems in a sequence.  Isn't the fact that they should be performed in a sequence make the tasks dependent, and thus not independently decomposable? Further, in the Appendix (section C multi-goal Reacher-N) the authors claim that the environment is decomposable into *nearly independent sub-tasks*, which is a little vague and confusing.\n\n**Algorithmic contribution is minimal**\n\nThe proposed algorithm is a minor modification over Dreamer, with the only significant change being sampling full-meta episodes instead of a smaller fixed length"

How does altering the number of sub-episodes influence the algorithm's performance?\n\n2. The algorithms are tested in deterministic environments (although I could be mistaken). How do you anticipate the performance would be affected if the environments were stochastic? Could the introduction of randomness potentially complicate the task identification process?\n\n**Minor Clarifications**\n\n1. In Figure 1 (left most) Why isn't the agent exploring the right portion of the semi-circle during the first episode? \n\n2. To enhance understanding, it would be beneficial to have comprehensive descriptions of the new environments (Multi Goal Rooms and Multi Goal Reacher), including details about their state-space, action space, and reward structure.\n\n3. I would encourage the authors to add markers to all plots to enhance readability."
