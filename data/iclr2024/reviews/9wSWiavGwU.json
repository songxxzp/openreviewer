They used the SimPilot simulator and implemented a rule-based algorithm to have the ego overtake other agents. They used the rule-based driver as the ground truth expert.\n\nThe authors then designed a transformer-based architecture to make lane-change decisions. The inputs of the model are lane ID segmentation images and agent information. The main task of the model is to predict lane-change decisions and lane-change velocities. They also proposed two auxiliary tasks. One is to predict the ego vehicle's future positions, and the other one is to predict a distance matrix between all agents.\n\nThe model uses ResNet-18 to encode the lane ID image and uses an attention-based module to process agent information.\n\nThe authors evaluated the proposed model in the simulation environment. They compared against the following baseline methods: MLP only, transformer only, transformer + auxiliary tasks, and SwapTransformer. The result shows that the proposed model has the best performance in terms of speed difference, time to finish, and overtake ratio."

The second contribution is the formulation of the problem: instead of tackling this problem as a motion planning or trajectory forecasting challenge, it is assumed that a controller exists for ego which can perform lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, and controlled lane changes, and that the   task is to provide the controller with inputs indicating when to perform lane changes and in which direction. The final contribution is a proposed model along with comparisons to a variety of baselines.\n\nThe dataset abstracts away the perception system, collecting lane segmentations and object lists from the environment. These inputs are passed through a CNN and transformer architecture with a few auxiliary tasks. The auxiliary tasks include ego trajectory prediction (represented as Bezier curve conrol points) and predicting the pairwise distances between all vehicles in the scene. The core task is predicting the lane change maneuver as well as future ego velocity five steps ahead.\n\nThe paper compares a variety of models. The proposed model, SwapTransformer, uses decomposed attention with transpose operations in between. The input object list is represented with two spatial dimensions, one for the input feature and one for time; alternating transformer encoders with self attention on either dimension resembles common approaches for handling 2D inputs (somewhat similar to e.g. Axial Attention, Salimans 2019, for example). The baselines are a transformer without auxiliary losses, a transformer with axis swapping, and a simple MLP baseline; the proposed model outperforms these baselines on a few metrics such as the speed prediction accuracy."

The dataset is generated in simulation specifically for this formulation of the problem. While less ambitious than approaches that tackle full imitation learning for the controller, this formulation is potentially simpler to deploy in a real-world system building upon existing driving assist capabilities.\n\nOverall, the quality of the writing is high and the descriptions are clear, with the caveat that system rests on the Traffic Assist system, the implementation of which is not documented besides a high-level explanation of its inputs and outputs"

If the key contribution is meant to be the dataset, I would recommend evaluating other future forecasting and prediction models (e.g. Wayformer) on the dataset; if the key is the model, I would consider focusing on public future forecasting benchmarks. If the main contribution is meant to be the problem decomposition, I would compare an end-to-end trajectory forecasting system with this proposed Traffic Assist-based decomposed model. Without these sort of connections to existing literature, it will be challenging for the community to derive value from this work."

If so, reports on the results of this work would strengthen the work significantly."

Although the proposed method finishes faster and overtakes more often is it possible that some of these were risky maneuvers (I.E. network predicted overtake when it shouldn\u2019t of)?
