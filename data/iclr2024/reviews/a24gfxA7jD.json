As indicated in the original score-based model paper, for each generative SDE, there is a corresponding probability flow ODE. While it is expensive and difficult to distill an SDE model, it is much easier to distill an ODE model. The author uses existing methods from the PINN literature to distill a probability flow trained with score matching. The empirical results are promising, but some theoretical assumptions, such as the score function is Lipschitz continuous, are a bit far-fetched."

The existing methods consistency model and EDM (which is heavily referred to when developing this paper) perform much better than the proposed method. \n\nThat being said, it would be great if the authors can demonstrate qualitatively and quantitively how the proposed method is better than EDM and/or consistency model (such as distillation efficiency, inference time, etc.)."
