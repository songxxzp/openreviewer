Initially, a diffusion model for vertices is defined using the graph Laplacian, which is then extended to create a diffusion model for paths. Once learned, the model can be used for path generation through conditional sampling given a pair of origin and destination vertices. A significant advantage of this approach is its capacity to learn expert paths without assuming that they minimize linearly accumulative costs, a departure from standard search-based path planning.\n\nThe proposed method is evaluated on real-world road network datasets and is shown to outperform several existing methods."

The ability of the proposed model to generate paths without assuming linearly accumulative costs is intriguing.\n\n**Quality**: The overall quality of the work is high. The proposed method is well-designed and technically sound.\n\n**Clarity**: The paper is well-written, with clear statements of the work's motivation and contribution.\n\n**Significance**: The significance of the proposed method is evaluated on a real road network dataset, a strong point of this work, although I have some concerns about the dataset itself, as shown below."

In other words, I'm not sure if the dataset is fully suited to demonstrate the proposed method's significance.\n\nIn fact, the performance improvements over Dijkstra search are not very significant in terms of the DTW metric. With only average scores reported, it's unclear whether the proposed method demonstrates overall small improvements or if there are a few samples in the dataset where baselines completely failed to work. Similarly, the performance difference between the proposed method and CSSRNN is relatively small in Table 3. Does this suggest that path planning on the new dataset can be mostly solved by existing approaches that assume linearly accumulative costs?\n\nAnother concern is the computational cost. Classical path planners like Dijkstra are appealing because they can run quickly even on CPUs. In practical situations, people use path planning (e.g., route search on a map app) on mobile devices that don't always have sufficient GPU resources. It's not clear how much computation resources are required by the proposed method and other baselines."

At least the standard deviation or confidence intervals should also be reported in each table, but I wonder if the proposed method's strength could have been demonstrated more systematically using synthetic data that simulate paths that existing methods cannot plan or imitate from demonstrations? Such controlled experiments can be as important as real-world data evaluations.\n- How does the proposed method compare to other baselines in terms of computational costs?"

                "value": "Overall I enjoyed reading this paper. I think the core of the method is good, interesting, and useful. I do have some questions:\n\n - In Table 3, the authors present an ablation as \"trivial uniform diffusion\". Do the authors mean the \"generic categorical diffusion\" with Q = $\\alpha_t I + \\beta_t 1 1^T / V$? If this is the case, the authors should make that more clear so that readers may enjoy the significant improvement their work brings. If this is not the case, and the authors mean something else, they should run another ablation using \"generic categorical diffusion\" as a baseline, since that seems like the relevant benchmark to beat.\n - Can the authors elaborate on the beam search aspect, and how often a sampled path is actually invalid (i.e., disconnected, or with loops, etc), and what heuristics are used to fix those sampled paths?\n - Can the authors discuss their Guassian mixture model for path lengths in some more detail? While some metrics are provided in the appendix, it is not clear what information this model takes, if any. It seems to me that path length is highly dependent on origin and destination, so I assume their mixture model takes these as input. Can the authors elaborate exactly what the structure of this model is?\n - What is the scaling of the algorithm? Especially compared to Dijkstra? Both in terms of path length, and number of graph vertices.\n - Can the authors elaborate on how they generalize to paths without learning a joint distribution across time? Sampling nodes independently certainly would not yield a sensible path. I could imagine this would work if the reverse process was conditionally independent (i.e. $x^i_{t-1} | x_t$, the latter $x_t$ being _all_ nodes instead of $x_t^i$), but eqn 9 does not actually seem to suggest that. The text touches on this (end of paragraph 3 in 4.3, \"masking $\\hat{x_0}$\"), but to me this statement is quite uninformative, and seems like a very essential point of the paper.\n - Does it generalize to different graphs? i.e. do you need to retrain for each city?\n\nMinor points:\nThe text is generally well written, but it seems like a few paragraphs were missed during the proof reading stage.\nA non-exhaustive list:\n - first paragraph of 4.2 \n - first paragraph of sec 5\n - App. D\n - 6.2 paragraph 2\n - typo in Fig 2. \"Pais\", it is also confusing for 3rd panel to say \"Real\", since the text says these were generated using Navi"
