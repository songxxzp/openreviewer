Is it average performance on all data?\n\t\n2. Table 1, authors bolded the values of Mirage in MSE, where clearly Cross-former is the lowest scores. Is this mistakes been done to create misinterpretation fir the reviewers or just type error?\n\n3. Overall the paper is very hard to conceive, specially Sec 4 Evaluation. \n\t- For someone not in medical/health data expert, the real world medical data needs a bit more explanation. What do the timeseries represent, length of the sequence, condition, etc.? Is biluribin level a time-series feature for patient?\n\t- I am not clear on the part how the trajectory steps are being tracked and how the heatmap being generated? Is the heatmap represent the attention weights?\n\t- used many abbreviations w/o terminology, e.g., acf\n\t- Table and Fig. captions are not self-explanatory.\n\n4.

Isn\u2019t this inherent to any TS data? If variable scale is an issue, why not just normalize? And how does MIRAGE specifically tackle this?\n* Why use an LSTM and not a transformer as prediction architecture?\n* How is $C$ determined?\n* Why is the MSE of MIRAGE on eICU data (Table 2) not reported? Perhaps authors could report reconstruction error in addition to  forecasting performance.\n* How do authors determine that \u201cinterpretations appear quite smooth\u201d in Fig 7?\n* Could authors provide numerical results that support the interpretability/correctness of latent trajectories, beyond the few qualitative examples proposed?\n* Also would be curious to understand how HUFL can be interpreted as contributing to a drop in variable OT, whereas the least dominant feature LULL also shows a trend over a similar timescale\u2026"
