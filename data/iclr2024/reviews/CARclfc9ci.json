The authors propose a convolution operator with a graphlet filter to learn higher-level object relations. The method allows it to be directly applied to the learning problem without the need to explicitly model then which is the case in traditional Graph Learning. The method consists of an inner product relation module and relational convolution. The inner product relation module models pairwise relations between the input sequences. The relational convolution module uses the graphlet filter to extract features of relations between various object groups. The model is tested on relation games and set card datasets showing strong performance."

                "value": "This paper tackles the problem of learning representations of relations between objects. Specifically, we are concerned with higher-order relations, that is, _relations between_ the relations between objects, and so on. This paper proposes a new neural network architecture by leveraging the principle of graphlet filters, to implicitly learn relations in an end-to-end fashion.\n\n## Algorithm\n\n1. We start with an initial set of $m$ objects, each represented by some vector.\n\n1. **Multi-dimensional inner product:** These objects are embedded in some space by some non-linear operation, and multiplied with a linear embedding matrix. We take the dot product between the embeddings of each pair of objects, to get an $m \\times m$ matrix representing the interactions between each pair. This process is repeated with $d_r$ different linear embedding matrices to get a $m \\times m \\times d_r$ tensor representing $d_r$ different kinds of interactions for each pair of objects.\n\n1. **Relational Convolution:** Now that we\u2019ve captured interactions between _pairs_, the next step is to represent interactions between _groups_. A graphlet filter is an $s \\times s \\times d_r$ tensor where $s \\le m$. The $m$ objects are split into groups of $s$ objects each, and we perform an inner product between the $s \\times s \\times d_r$ graphlet filter and the $s \\times s \\times d_r$ pair-wise interaction sub-tensor from the larger $m \\times m \\times d_r$ tensor. This is meant to mimic image convolution with a filter.\n\n    This will give us a single number. This process is repeated for $n_f$ different filters to get a vector of size $n_f$ representing different aspects of the group. If there are $|\\mathcal{G}| = {m \\choose s}$ different groups, then this gives us $|\\mathcal{G}|$ different embeddings, each of size $n_f$, to carry to the next layer of the architecture.\n\n4. **Grouping:** What if $|\\mathcal{G}|$ is too large and we can only consider a maximum $n_g$ groups? The authors propose to learn $n_g$ \u201csoft\u201d groups, by using a learned \u201cgroup matrix\u201d $G$ of size $m \\times n_g$. An entry of this matrix $(i, k)$ captures how much the $i$th element belongs to group $k$. Given some group of elements $g$, we can calculate their affinity for group $k$ by simply multiplying together the scores $G[i, k]$ of all the elements $i$ that belong to group $g$ (with some Softplus/Softmax stuff to take care of positivity and normalization). These affinity scores form a matrix of dimension $|\\mathcal{G}| \\times n_g$.\n\n    This is where the embeddings of dimension $n_f$ from the previous layer come in. Each embedding corresponds to some group $g \\in \\mathcal{G}$. This forms a matrix of $n_f \\times |\\mathcal{G}|$. Multiply this with the affinity matrix $(|\\mathcal{G}| \\times n_g)$ to get $n_g$ embeddings, each of dimension $n_f$.\n\n5. Through Steps 1, 2, and 3, we have transformed the representations of $m$ objects into $n_g$ representations, each corresponding to some grouping of the $m$ objects. This altogether comprises one layer of the RelConvNet, and there can be arbitrarily many layers to capture hierarchical relation information.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe authors then compare their model with other models on two benchmarks - a \u201crelational games\u201d artificially constructed benchmark, and the game SET. They show that their model is able to learn complex relational tasks in a sample-efficient manner, and the gains are most pronounced for the most complex tasks.\n\nPerhaps most impressively, the authors show that all the other models are _unable_ to learn the game of SET, at least with the train/test setting and the architecture that the authors considered."

The discussion about Transformers as message-passing networks with implicit relations was a new and interesting perspective for me.\n\n1. The presented architecture is very very general, yet none of the design choices feel arbitrary. It is clear why the architecture achieves the inductive bias that the authors want. Its structure reflects its desired function.\n\n1. The evaluation clearly shows the superiority of the proposed architecture for solving specialized relational reasoning problems. In particular, the result on SET was very impressive."

Despite interpretability being presented as an advantage of this architecture, there is no qualitative analysis of the results on SET or relational games. It would be fun to see how the model has implicitly learned to group things according to shapes and patterns, and how the final decision comes together by aggregating all this information.\n\n1. (This point is also mentioned by the authors in Limitations, but re-iterating). This paper\u2019s approach is seemingly very powerful, capable of modeling interactions between many objects (with learned soft grouping) and learning higher-order relations beyond just second-order. But the evaluation is relatively tame in comparison, almost a toy example. Presented in this light, the paper seems almost like a solution in search of a problem, rather than the other way around. I feel like a short discussion about some real-world applications of such hierarchical reasoning would round-off the paper well.\n\nBecause of these two concerns, I gave this paper an overall score of 8 instead of the full 10."

If my understanding is correct, second-order relations need **two** layers to be represented accurately by your model. How is it that you\u2019re still able to model SET and the \u201cmatch pattern\u201d accurately?\n\n1. I can think of a much easier way to do the grouping layer described in Section 4 - just have a single linear transform of dimension $|\\mathcal{G}| \\times n_g$, with learnable parameters (and probably a Softmax). I assume you must have considered this and rejected it; could you give a short explanation of why? Is it because it is more parameter-efficient to use a matrix of size $m \\times n_g$?\n\n1. What are some real-world applications of higher-order relational reasoning that could make use of the full power of this model (with multiple layers and learned soft groups)? I know that one could construct artificial benchmarks, but I would like to qualitatively understand the problem too.\n\n1. Could you provide some insight into the interpretability of what the model learns? For example, for the SET game, does one of the dimensions correspond to \u201ccolour\u201d, one to \u201cshape\u201d, one to \u201cnumber\u201d?"

This grows quadratically with $n$, so could become prohibitive for large $n$. The paper does not discuss optimizations like sparsity. In relational convolutions, naively considering all possible groups of objects scales exponentially. The grouping mechanisms help, but analysis of their scaling is lacking. Stacking many relational convolution layers could substantially grow the sequence length, increasing memory and computation per layer. The paper does not report metrics like parameter count or floating point operations. There is no experiment systematically increasing the number of objects and relations to analyze how performance degrades and costs increase. The experiments use fairly small input sizes.\n\n* Main experiments are on simple synthetic tasks.\n\nThe relational games and SET tasks have at most simple second-order relations. Testing on tasks requiring modeling higher-order relations would better evaluate the capabilities of the relational convolutional networks. Besides, these tasks have a small fixed number of objects. Scaling to variable, larger numbers of objects would be more realistic.\n\n* Lacks comparisons to recent related works on explicit relational reasoning.\n\nThe paper cites some prior works on relational reasoning like PrediNet and CoRelNet, but does not discuss or compare to other very recent methods such as Abstractors. By empirically comparing performance of relational convolutional networks to these contemporaneous methods on relational reasoning tasks, the unique advantages and tradeoffs of the proposed approach could be clarified. The lack of these head-to-head comparisons makes it harder to situate the advances of this architecture among other recent work. Adding these comparisons would significantly strengthen the paper."
