Overall, there is a lot of content squeezed in the 9 pages which makes the paper mostly incomprehensible.\n- Due to above issue, I strongly suggest to publish the paper in a journal (which usually have no page limits). The quality of the write-up would highly benefit from this.\n- Section 2 (Methods) needs a major rewrite to make it more accessible to readers not familiar with image quality metrics. Here are some points that can be improved:\n    1. The section mentions multiple times that $\\Delta_v \\in [0,1]$. \n    2. The variable c is used before it was defined.\n    3. Authors should stress that $\\Delta_v$ is just an auxiliary quantity that later is used to define the VCR.\n    4. Authors could consider adding a figure to give an overview of the used and introduced metrics. As a reader, I was overwhelmed by all these acronyms. An overview would have been very helpful.\n- I very much appreciate that the authors shared their code, however I find it inappropriate to refer to it as a \"toolbox\". In my opinion a toolbox is an installable Python package that is easily applicable to different models and datasets. Authors have to spend more time on their code repository before calling it a \"toolbox\".\n\nMinor details:\n- page 2: $max$ should be $\\max$\n- Tbl. 2 -> Tab. 2\n- typo page 4: \u201ccoverages= of\u201d and \u201c[0..1]\u201d (should be [0,1])\n- Two paragraphs in the abstract look unusual\n- Suggestions: \"Uniform(0,1)\" -> \"U(0,1)\""
