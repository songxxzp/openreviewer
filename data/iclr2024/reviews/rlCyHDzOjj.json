For empirical evaluations, the authors only compare with TT and T-SVD, both of which are very old and classical models. It should be encouraged to choose more recent baselines.\n5.

This might be interesting in applications where there are natural multi-dimensional correlations such as videos, genetics and others.\n\nI have the following comments about the paper:\n\n1. The presentation is difficult to follow and certain details about the method are not clear.\n\ni.  Firstly, the main section 4 will be difficult to follow for readers unfamiliar with tensor methods, particularly the T-product. Currently, it is not clear how the factor tensors interact with each other to form the full N-order tensor. The T-product between 4th-order tensor and how to multiply a third tensor with a fourth order tensor contracted using T-product is not obvious.\n\nii. t is claimed that applying T-SVD to higher order tensors suffers from the curse of dimensionality problem . But this is not clear or obvious to readers and should be explained why this is the case, and how does TTT over come this issue.\n\niii. how to choose the TTT-rank vector for a given N-order tensor? Are these ranks unique for given tensor? Are they related to tubal rank corresponding to T-SVD?\n\niv. How do we show that the space of all tensors of TTT-rank no higher than a given r_k is closed?\n\nv. What does best low TTT rank mean and how to compute this for a given tensor?\n\nvi. Algorithm 1 output says,  an approximation with error tolerance \\epsilon is returned. But this \\epsilon is not an input parameter. How do we control the error? Perhaps this is a typo.\n\n2. The computational cost and scalability of the proposed method is not clear.\n\n3. In the numerical experiments, we things are not clear.\n\ni. Why is the runtime of TTT less than the TT method? Shouldn't T-SVD computation be more expensive than SVD?\n\nii. The advantage of TTT in the applications considered is not really clear and seems a bit forced. Reshaping the images into 10th ordertensor seems strange, and the choice of the rank values in TTT-rank vector seems arbitrary. Wouldn't considering the images (in all 4 examples) as 3rd order tensors and just using T-SVD be good enough? Comparison with this approach of just treating the images and videos in the natural 3rd order form and using T-SVD would be interesting to show that TTT actives something different/better. \n\niii. Why a 10-order tensor is considered and what happens to the performance if a lower order is chosen? \n\nMinor Comment:\n\ni. Section 3.2, middle tensor if -->  middle tensor is\n\nii. Recently, \\star_M product, a generalization of the T-product, where FFT is replaced by a general invertible matrix M has been proposed. Perhaps, TTT can be extended using this general version of the tensor product. For image applications, it has been shown that DCT matrix as M performs better than FFT."
