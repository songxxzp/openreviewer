The paper presents two significant contributions: firstly, the introduction of an adversarial training framework for COD tasks, and secondly, the implementation of ICEG to overcome the limitations of incomplete segmentation and ambiguous boundaries for camouflaged objects. However, the two contributions seem disconnected, and they appear to be independent approaches aimed at enhancing network segmentation without a clear connection between them. Consequently, the primary storyline of the work is missing. The authors must establish the relationship between the two contributions and articulate how they work together to achieve the overall objective of the paper.\n\n2. The adversarial training framework, which represents the primary contribution of this paper, is not a novel concept. Although it has yet to be implemented in COD tasks, the fundamental idea and implementation are similar to other tasks, such as image deblurring. It would be beneficial to underscore the unique difficulties and differences between COD and other tasks if the implementation is non-trivial.\n\n3. Missing detailed descriptions for Figure 3. It lacks detailed descriptions and makes it challenging to comprehend the main idea presented. Given the complexity of the figure, it is important to provide proper explanations to ensure a comprehensive understanding. I think that the explanation of the network design may come across as a technical report and, as such, should be included in the supplementary material. In the body of the paper, I would like to see clear and concise motivations and rationales for each design, rather than technical details. The author should enhance the descriptions in Figure 3 to ensure they are easily understandable for readers.\n\n4. It is imperative to ascertain the efficacy of the proposed adversarial training framework for other state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks by conducting ablations of the framework with alternative methods. This endeavor would furnish evidence to substantiate the generalizability of the proposed approach and its applicability to other networks."
