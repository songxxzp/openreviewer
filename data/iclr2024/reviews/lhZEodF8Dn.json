EDDPM utilizes probabilistic reparameterization to determine whether a time step should be skipped or not, thereby identifying and eliminating redundant steps during training. This approach, which jointly learns mask distribution parameters with model weights, includes a real-time sparse constraint to significantly enhance training efficiency. Remarkably, as the model reaches full proficiency, random masks converge to a sparse and deterministic form, retaining only crucial steps."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. As far as I know, there is typically a trade-off between sampling speed and sample quality. Having fewer sampling steps usually improves the sampling speed but often results in a decline in the quality of generated samples. This observation has been discussed in numerous studies focused on accelerating diffusion sampling. Why does Figure 1 indicate an enhancement in sample quality when the number of sampling steps is very low? Is this a consequence of randomness or an mean outcome? Is there a qualitative explanation?\n\n2. If I didn't miss it, the article doesn't employ the L0 norm. If that's the case, I recommend not introducing L0 in the notation section. Additionally, in Equation 6 and subsequent formulas, if you are using the L2 norm, I suggest explicitly writing it as $||\\cdot||_2$ not $||\\cdot||$.\n3. Under section 3, \"In this section, for the convenience of presenting our method DDPM......\", I think it should be EDDPM;\n4. Regarding the mask variable, $\\mathbf{m}_t$, I understand it to be the $t$-th entry of the vector $\\mathbf{m}$. Following tradition, a single random variable should not be represented in bold form, and it is recommended to write as $m_t$.\n5. Under Eq.(9), $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(\\mathbf{x}_t,\\mathbf{x}_0)$, $\\tilde{\\beta}_t$ should be written as $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_t(\\mathbf{x}_t,\\mathbf{x}_0,\\mathbf{m})$, $\\tilde{\\beta}_t(\\mathbf{m})$, because they depend on $\\mathbf{m}$. \n6. Under Eq.(9), in the definition of $\\tilde{\\beta}_t$ it has an extra \"t\" in the lower right corner.\n7. Due to the L1 constraint on $\\mathbf{s}$, most entries in $\\mathbf{s}$ will be pushed to 0. But why are the other entries pushed towards 1? Are there situations where some $m_t$ are around 0.5? In such cases, how should step $t$ be handled? Is there any explanation?\n8. Under eq.11, it should be $\\nabla_{\\theta}\\Phi(\\theta,s)$ and $\\nabla_{s}\\Phi(\\theta,s)$.\n9. Equation 12 is confusing because $\\gamma_e$ is not used in the algorithm. Is this a typo? Is it the case that $K=\\gamma_e*T$, and $\\gamma_e$ is expressed as in equation 12?\n10. In the context of image synthesis, the baseline comparison is limited. There are many acceleration sampling algorithms proposed for image synthesis, such as DPM-solver (Lu et al., 2022). While these works are mentioned in the related work section, they are not compared in the experiments.\n11. There are several issues with the citation format and some references are duplicated or inappropriately cited in arXiv format, even though they have been published."

Also, it's not very clear to me why the learned $s$ is doomed to be almost 0 or 1 . The L1 constraint can do it for sure.
