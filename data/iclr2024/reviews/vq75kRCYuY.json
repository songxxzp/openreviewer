There is no formal/theoretical justification for the claim \u201cwe believe that the information of the accumulative neurons in the final time step could yield the most distinct and clear error value among all given time steps\u201d. It is obvious that only considering spatial gradient for the last time step will lose a lot of information on previous time steps, and the experimental results indeed show a significant drop in accuracy, especially for neuromorphic datasets with temporal sequences. For static datasets, there is no temporal information and binary neural networks (or taking T=1 for SNNs) can easily work well, so experiments are not surprising or appealing. It is unclear what\u2019s the advantage of the proposed method over existing online training methods [1,2].\n\n2. The idea of the proposed method may, to some extent, be viewed as a special case of a recent work [3]. It proposes a method SLTT, which drops the temporal dependency of BPTT and only uses spatial gradients at each time step, and it further proposes a variant SLTT-k, which randomly samples k time steps for the spatial gradient. The method in this paper may be viewed as taking k=1 and fixing the considered time step as the last time step. However, this paper ignores gradients for previous time steps, leading to much poorer performance.\n\n[1] A solution to the learning dilemma for recurrent networks of spiking neurons.
