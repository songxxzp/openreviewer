However, instead of categorizing sample difficulty into two binary sets, wouldn't it be better to dynamically control the learning process by assigning weights or using other methods based on continuous difficulty values? Additionally, excluding OOD/outlier and atypical samples from model training could potentially enhance the model's generalization capability. So, couldn't excluding them altogether from training be a suboptimal choice?\n3) The author mentioned that existing works have a disadvantage of conducting indirect evaluation in downstream tasks. In that case, how does the proposed framework perform direct evaluation?\n4) In Figure 6, Spearman rank correlation scores for HCMs are reported. As far as I know, Spearman rank correlation calculates the correlation between two variables. How was the correlation computed from multiple runs in this case?"

The Near OOD, far OOD, and the atypical perturbations used in the experiments are oversimplified in my opinion. In the real world, defining near/far OOD and atypical have a complicated notion of support of the sample distribution, but the use of Gaussian noise, texture changes for near OOD and exchanging MNIST with CIFAR (which are drastically different) for far OOD, and using simple invariant functions like shift and zoom for atypical does not do justice to these concepts.\n3. [Minor] The bulk of paper is focussed on creating a taxonomy for hardness evaluation and then building a software toolkit to evaluate existing methods for its quantification. Some initial discussions during the taxonomy creation and some of the non-obvious takeaways are instructive for the researchers in this field, but most of this work is geared towards practitioners. This isn't necessarily a negative thing, but limits the research novelty/impact of the work."

Before evaluating HCMs, you need to know what type of hardness is present in the data. This may not always be possible in real-world scenarios.\n2.

If I understood incorrectly, please provide clarification. Also the categorization of hardness into mislabel, ood and atypical is quite unsatisfying. Why mislabel? Also in this era of self-supervision, LLM autoregressive, etc., I find this paper a little not keeping up with time. What is hardness in this new day and age?\n\nExperiments on cifar and mnist only --- authors claimed that they did not select imagenet because imagenet has less than 5% mislabel.

                "value": "The paper presents a benchmark for evaluating methods that make supervised learning models robust to hard data examples. The paper introduces a taxonomy of hard cases and defines each category in terms of where the corruption happens and how the data distributions differ. The authors developed a toolkit to automatically evaluate models and include 13 algorithms in their study. The paper summarizes the results and presents the main highlights, together with an extensive supplementary material with more details."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* The conclusions of the study seem limited. Despite the extensive experimental work, it is unclear how the hardness characterization field can make progress. While the paper claims to have practical tips, there is the underlying assumption that the hardness type is known and coming from only one type. This is not realistic in practice and undermines the value of the recommendations for practitioners.\n* The paper insists that studying data hardness is critical for advancing data-centric AI, but it is unclear what data-centric AI is, and why HCMs are the key to advance it. A more fundamental question is, do we really need HCMs at all or we only need to create high quality datasets that eliminate corrupted examples?\n* Following the need for HCMs, a baseline of training models without HCMs is missing. There are two scenarios that should be considered as baselines: 1) training a model without HCM with the same level of corruption introduced as the other models. 2) Training a model without HCM and with only the easy examples, i.e. removing the portion of corrupted samples. This would be informative to evaluate what cases in the taxonomy really need to be investigated further with HCMs and which ones can be addressed by simply cleaning the dataset.\n* The taxonomy is manually defined based on the interpretation of previous literature, and the datasets used in the study are intentionally clean (MNIST and CIFAR) to simulate hard samples. Perhaps data hardness should be evaluated in a data-driven way, i.e., using a real world dataset and using data science, statistics, and machine learning to find out the nature of hard samples on the dataset. This reviewer finds the approach of defining the hardness of data artificial, and perhaps not reflecting the challenges of current problems and datasets.\n* The paper points to the use of indirect measures, such as improvement in downstream performance, as an issue (Sec. 2.2). However, it seems like the metric that they use to evaluate methods and create the benchmark is downstream performance in the corresponding classification task. It was not clear what the proposed solution to this issue is in the benchmark.\n* The writing style and paper formatting is too flashy and very distracting. Instead of having a natural flow, the paper has sentences in bold, boxes in colors, and other decorations that ask for too much attention, giving the impression that there is something more important to read than the argument the reader is focusing on. I found this style very hard to follow. In addition, the paper reads as if it was trying hard to sell a toolkit rather than presenting a study with solid conclusions."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Unfortunately, I don't find this study very compelling as a full research article. As it is currently, the paper seems to be more appropriate for a Datasets & Benchmarks track at NeurIPS, for instance, rather than bringing in novel insights to advance hardness characterization methodology. Maybe I'm missing what the most important conclusion is, which is what I'd like the authors to clarify."
