                "value": "Although the content of the current version is satisfactory, some points listed below can further enhance the depth and completeness of this work:\n\n- Some details regarding the diffusion model need clarification. For example, the sampling strategy is not very clear to me. It seems the authors deploy a VP sampling with uniform sliding timesteps similar to the one used in Nichol and Dhariwal, (2021). In the appendix and the code the authors also seem to leverage some implementation from Karras et al. (2022). As we note the sampler in Karras et al. (2022) involves additional correction steps, the NFE of the diffusion backbone would be more than T. \n\n- The theoretical results are based on the hypothesis that the evidence lower bound is tight. It would be intriguing to explore the implications of the gap between the likelihood and this lower bound, especially when viewed through the lens of the Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification. Exploring how this gap influences robust classification performance could enrich the paper's depth and utility.\n\n\n- While the current experiments are limited to relatively small-scale datasets, there is inherent value in examining the method's scalability. It would be beneficial if the authors could present results or potential methodologies to apply their approach to larger datasets, drawing inspiration from other generative classifiers in the Bayesian paradigm, such as those highlighted by Heek and Nal (2019) and Han et al. (2022).\n\n\n- This paper also has close relation to other generative classifiers not specified for robust classification. Although the authors have discussed some concurrent works, some prior works may need to include and discuss potential connections. \n\n- The current form of the paper draws parallels to several generative classifiers, though not specifically designed for robust classification. While some works have been discussed as concurrent works, it might be helpful in enhancing the completeness to integrate and discuss other prior works, emphasizing their relevance and potential connections to the proposed methodology.\n\n----------\nReference:\n\nHeek, Jonathan, and Nal Kalchbrenner. \"Bayesian inference for large scale image classification.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.03491 (2019).\n\nMackowiak, R., Ardizzone, L., Kothe, U., & Rother, C.

                "value": "The main weaknesses are twofold: computational complexity and paper presentation.\n\n### Computational Complexity\n\nEven with the proposed multi-head U-Net and other complexity reduction measures, the computational complexity still seems to be high. While the likelihood maximization step only requires $N=5$ forward and backward passes, approximating $p(x|y)$ requires $T$ U-Net queries. That being said, I agree that this drawback can be left for future work.\n\n### Paper Presentation\n\nMany important details are missing from the discussion. Some of them can be found in the appendix, but they really should be in the main text. This is especially the case for Section 3.3.\n- Theorem 3.2 discusses \"optimal diffusion models\". In what sense is the diffusion model optimal? The proof to this theorem clarifies that such a model minimizes the noise estimation error, but this should be in the main text.\n- There is a softmax operation in Theorem 3.2, but the quantity on which it operates is a scalar (a norm square divided by some variance). What does softmax exactly mean here? Same for Corollary 3.3.\n- \"We find that the optimal diffusion classifier achieves 100% robust accuracy in both cases, validating our hypothesize that accurate density estimation of diffusion models facilitates robust classification.\" How was this found? Also, it should be \"hypothesis\", not \"hypothesize\". What is the main gap between an optimal diffusion classifier and an empirical diffusion classifier? Is it the limited amount of training data? Or is it how well the U-Net is optimized?\n- Section 3.5 says, \"instead of calculating the diffusion loss using all timesteps like Eq. (9), we only sample a single timestep\". How is this time step sampled? Uniformly randomly?\n- Section 3.5 also says, \"(BPDA) approximates the gradient with an identity mapping\". How exactly is the identity mapping applied? A pseudo-code or Python code explanation would be appreciated.\n- It would be nice to have the experiment results from the CIFAR-100 dataset to have some diversity in the evaluation."

                "value": "- Since AutoAttack with BPDA is used for evaluation, is the Square Attack component of AutoAttack also included in the evaluation? Does Square find additional examples on top of the BPDA gradient-based attacks?\n- In Figure 2a, why is the robust accuracy barely over 30%? What is the value of $T$ and $T'$ for the main results (Table 1)? Does the result get even better if $T'$ is larger than 1000? How large is $T$ during the training of the diffusion model? If we train a diffusion model with fewer time steps (i.e., discretize the trajectory into less than 1000 steps during training), should we expect the resulting classifier obtained via the proposed method to work well with a smaller $T'$?\n- With multi-head diffusion, is it true that only the last layer receives the class condition signal? How does this affect the performance compared with injecting class conditioning into various locations in the U-Net? It would also be nice to see some generations from this diffusion model."
