Specifically, more efficient (smaller) sets compared to RSCP while having the same guarantee, and larger worst-case lower bound.\n\nThe technical and theorethical components of the paper are sufficiently detailed and rigorous. Theorem 3 can be seen as a generalization of Theorem 2 by Gendler et al. The analysis in Section 6, while making stronger assumptions, is interesting and shows when we can expect improvement.\n\nThe exprimental results are expected since the derived bounds are tighter.\n\nThe contribution is significant, as is the improvement over the previous SOTA."

                "value": "While the authors do consider the finite-sample error induced by the finite size of the calibration set, they fail to account for the finite-sample error due to the Monte-Carlo sampling (they use 10000 samples) when estimating the expectations under the randomized smoothing framework. Therefore, the resulting sets are only asymptotically valid.\n\nAs pointed out by a concurent ICLR submission (https://openreview.net/forum?id=BWAhEjXjeG) RSCP also suffers from the same issue and it is non-trivial to correct for this. The same issue is also discussed among the reviewers and the RSCP authors on their respective openreview page (https://openreview.net/forum?id=9L1BsI4wP1H). Naively, one would have to apply a union bound over all examples in the calibration set and the test example such that each of the randomized smoothing expectations hold simultaneously. There is also a subtler alternative solution. When correcting RSCP for this error the resulting sets end up returning all labels, i.e. they are useless. It is not clear to which degree COLEP suffers from the same issue. In any case, the \"fix\" proposed by the concurent submission is orthogonal and can be applied to COLEP as well. Still, this finite-sample issue needs to be addressed in the paper, especially given that the goal is to produce a sound certificate. \n\nThe second weakness is in the PGD attack. The authors state \"For fair comparisons, we apply PGD attack (Madry et al., 2018) with the same parameters on CP, RSCP, and COLEP\". However, it is unclear whether the PGD attack is adaptive, i.e. it takes the learning-reasoning component into account. An adaptive attacker can in fact know that a reasoning component is used, and thus can try to perturb the input such that both the class and the concept probabilities are suitably changed as to fool the entire pipeline. While this is not critical, not using adaptive attacks makes the conclusions drawn from Figure 3 less reliable."

The main new component is the integration of probabilistic circuits into the construction of a nonconformity score of the APS (Romano et al) type, where an underlying model's class probabilities output is postprocessed according to a collection of reasoning rules, which help correct each class's predicted probability before plugging it into the APS score. The benefits of the reasoning components are investigated theoretically, by means of a theorem stating that under some assumptions marginal coverage will be strictly better with than without these components, as well as experimentally over three datasets and compared to two benchmark conformal method (one with adversarially robust guarantees)."

It is also more generally easy (as the authors show) to propagate estimation uncertainty through the learning-reasoning pipeline. This type of provable guarantees is, to my knowledge, novel and has not come up in the conformal literature before.\n\nMoreover, the proposed technique is more flexible than standard conformal prediction, in that it can provide guarantees not just over all classes, but also for each class separately (at its own coverage threshold).\n\nThese above technical innovations, as well as the practical potential of learning-reasoning components to improve domain-specific performance of conformal prediction, lead me to conclude that the proposed paper would be a novel and interesting addition to the conformal literature."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Empirical evaluation is quite limited, which is quite unfortunate given that including more settings beyond datasets as simple as CIFAR-10, as well as more benchmarks, would likely let the guarantees afforded by the learning-reasoning setup shine even more: both in terms of the ability to construct rules specific to each considered setting, as well as the resulting adaptivity compared to other conformal scores/methods.\n\nRelevantly, I was quite confused when the authors repeatedly call the APS score of Romano et al (2020) 'SOTA'. It is certainly one of the existing reasonable conformal approaches to use, but by no means state of the art when it comes to adaptivity and especially set size. For instance, its generalization and improvement, the RAPS nonconformity score introduced in \"Uncertainty Sets for Image Classifiers using Conformal Prediction\", may still be considered close to the SOTA frontier for many domains --- and it would be very pertinent to include it, along with further improved conformal methods developed thereafter. Also, CIFAR 10 not quite sounding like the natural domain to apply potentially highly complex learning-reasoning boosts, it'd be wise to show the performance of the framework on Imagenet; as a byproduct, it would help me convince myself of the tractability of useful learning-reasoning in more challenging settings. In any case, having just three relatively simple datasets and only two comparison methods, Romano et al and Gendler et al, appears insufficient to fully explore the relative advantages of learning-reasoning.\n\n2. The main other weakness to me is the overbearing nature of the notation used, and the overall presentation. It took me many hours to internalize the type of the guarantees that learning-reasoning components lead to, and even the notation itself. Moreover, especially the multi-subscript-superscript notation involved in both theorem statements and proofs related to the learning-reasoning component was very hard to parse and even read. The notational review in the last appendix was a nice touch, but only marginally helpful as it only listed some of the relevant notation; Diagram in Figure 4, describing the overall certification flow, also felt confusing and didn't really help, making me resort to understanding text only. Instead of structured definitions of the main notations and concepts (using appropriate latex environments), everything was crammed into the paragraphs, thus diluting the structure of the presentation and making it hard to backtrack to the context in which a piece of notation was originally defined."

In discussing experimental results, it is of especial interest to discuss which learning-reasoning components were used in each domain. Other details are quite standard and common in the conformal literature, but this one is novel and thus should be propagated to the main part rather than left in the appendix. The current running example is the stop sign example, but it would be very useful to have a walk-through of how the rules were implemented in actual experiments.\n3. In the same vein, right now the experimental part only features plots of standard metrics (coverage, set size, ..) Meanwhile, I would like to see a visualization of what the learning-reasoning components do to the predictions of the underlying model --- e.g. which rules turned out to correct the initial estimates by the largest amount, etc.\n4.

                "value": "COLEP is a learning-reasoning framework for conformal prediction that provides improved certified prediction coverages under adversarial perturbations. The framework is composed of a learning/sensing component followed by a knowledge-enabled logical reasoning component. The learning component consists of several deep learning models while the reasoning component consists of one or more probabilistic circuits. Alongside the main classification task, the deep learning models are used to predict and estimate the probabilities of other concepts in the input e.g. shape, color etc. The PCs in the reasoning component encode domain knowledge specified as propositional rules over the class and concept variables and helps to ensure robustness against $\\ell_2$ bounded adversarial perturbations to the input variables. The experiments show that COLEP achieves higher prediction coverages as well as smaller prediction set sizes compared to other SOTA methods."

                "value": "The paper presents a novel idea to improve certified robustness of conformal prediction using deep learning models. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work on using tractable probabilistic circuits to improve the coverage of conformal prediction.\n   \nA positive side of the work is its theoretical analyses. The authors have derived certified coverage for COLEP under both $ell_2$ and finite calibration sample size. And then show that COLEP received higher certified coverage compared to a single model. \n\nExperimental results are also promising."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The manuscript is strong overall, but there are areas where it could benefit from further elaboration and additional empirical support. \n\n1. The reasoning part seems to be missing significant details to understand how the PCs are working together to reduce the error produced by the main classifier. The paper makes a strong assumption that the reader will be familiar with semantics of PC structures. There should be some brief introduction to these models. \n\n2. The leaf weights (factor weights) are assumed to be prespecified and then there are also the Bernoulli parameters estimated by the neural networks.  It is unclear how these estimated parameters, predictions (classes and concepts) and user defined knowledge rules are combined together to make robust decisions. The coefficients of the component PCs $\\beta_k$ should be more clearly specified in the main manuscript.  \n\n3. The theorems in the main paper need a more detailed discussion. Having only a short paragraph for each theorem doesn't fully explain the complexities and nuances involved, which doesn't give the paper's theoretical contributions their due.\n\n4. To make the empirical evaluation stronger, the authors could consider using more datasets or testing against different types of attacks. This will help confirm that COLEP is robust and works well in various situations."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. How many PCs were considered in each of the experiments? Can the authors give an idea on the complexity of the PCs? \n\n2. Can the scope of the evaluation be extended to include the performance of COLEP against  other forms of adversarial attacks? \n\n3. Why wasn't the effect of varying the parameter $\\alpha$ and $\\rho$ on COLEP's performance analyzed?"
