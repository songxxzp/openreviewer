The key idea is to map the latent token embeddings to the final output space by disabling self-attention and propagating through the feedforward layers. This allows retrieving the closest text description for each token from the model's vocabulary. The authors demonstrate how these interpretations can provide insights into the model's reasoning and enable controlling model behaviors like fixing adversarial attacks, reducing biases, and replacing entities."

Since CLIP aligns the visual embeddings (CLS) with the texts, the method can retrieve texts based on the CLS embedding after turning off the cross-attentions. Otherwise, if the model\u2019s token embeddings are not trained to be aligned with the texts, it is doubtful whether the method can still work or not. It would be best if the authors can show that the method can workin on other non-text trained models like MAE, DINOv2, etc.\n\n2. Most of the comparisons are against the \u201crandom baseline\u201d, which is not a very strong baseline. For example, additional stronger baselines should be compared with, like the ones listed in the \u201cmodel interpretation\u201d in the related works sections. Moreover, it\u2019s better to include related work [1].\n\n3. The method is based on text-retrieval, which assumes a finite set of candidate texts (closed world). In related work, the authors criticize that Koh et al (2020) (concept bottleneck network) is limited to a closed vocabulary, but isn\u2019t this work also closed vocabulary? \n\n4. The method is training free. As an extension, can the method be extended for improving model training? \n\n[1] (arxiv 2301.13081 STAIR: Learning Sparse Text and Image Representation in Grounded Tokens)"

There is no theoretical motivation -- which isn't strictly needed, but I would be much likelier to trust the method beyond just the empirical results.\n\n- It's unclear what the benefit of these natural language descriptions for latent tokens is, or how these descriptions should be leveraged. The examples in Section 4.3 (\"Our Interpretations Reveal Visual Reasoning\") do not seem very convincing, and are more about how one chooses to interpret the tokens' NL descriptions (e.g. I would not think \"motor vehicle\" + \"valley\" = \"overpass\" is necessarily a correct reasoning, let alone whether that's actually how the model went about the reasoning process)."

The first question is why we want to find latent tokens but not salient regions?\n\nConceptually, the biggest advantage is that there might exist \u201chigh-level\u201d and \u201cabstract\u201d latent tokens. For example, in Figure 3, using Grad-CAM to find regions corresponding to \u201coverpass\u201d might result in a lot of matched image patches while using the proposed method can find one single latent token corresponding to the concept.\n\nHowever, this is not reflected in the quantitative experiments. For the fixing typographical attacks and reducing spurious correlations experiments, ideally a gradient-based baseline could be included, where we seek to use grad-cam to find and zero-out a few important image patches. Then one could compare whether the proposed method can achieve the same performance but zeroing out less tokens. Otherwise, it is hard to claim that the method can find \u201chigh-level\u201d latent tokens.\n\n\n(2). Suppose we wish to find latent tokens corresponding to a text description, why should we resort to the proposed method but not a gradient-based method where we calculate the gradient with respect to each latent tokens of every layer?
