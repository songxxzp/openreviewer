In fact, in the paper, the authors replace the uniformly bounded gradients with bounded second-order moments, which still bounds the gradients of the expected function. Further, [1] shows the convergence of Adam without the assumption of gradients uniformly bounded or second-order moments bounded.\n\n2. In practice, people will use random shuffle instead of random sampling. However, the convergence results only hold for random sampling. In fact, there is a counter-example for the proposed algorithm that can not converge when we use a random shuffle. Let $\\beta1 = \\beta2 = 0$, and $f_1(x) = 1.9x$ and $f_2(x) = f_3(x) = -x$. With the constraint that $x \\in [-1,1]$ the optimal solution should be 1 instead of -1. Thus, although the algorithm can converge in the random sampling setting, it does not deal the case in the practical case.\n\n\n[1] Li, Haochuan, Ali Jadbabaie, and Alexander Rakhlin. \"Convergence of Adam Under Relaxed Assumptions.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.13972 (2023)."
