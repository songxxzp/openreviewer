                "value": "This paper presents a method called InsertNeRF, which aims to instill generalizability into Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) without extensive modifications to the vanilla NeRF framework. The method utilizes multiple plug-and-play HyperNet modules to dynamically tailor NeRF's weights to specific reference scenes, allowing for more accurate and efficient representations of complex appearances and geometries. The main contributions of InsertNeRF are: (1) introducing a novel paradigm that inserts HyperNet modules into NeRF-like systems to achieve generalizability, (2) designing two types of HyperNet module structures tailored to different NeRF attributes, and (3) demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and potential in various NeRF-like systems. The paper also discusses related works on generalizable NeRF and hyper-networks, and provides an overview of the method's background and implementation details."

Section 2.1 do not include Hypernetworks based NeRF. Authors do not mention TriPlaneNeRF or MultiPlaneNERF. Furthermore the generative models using NeRF should be mentioned. \n4. It is quite difficult to understand formula (3). F_view take as an input one point (x,d) or all points on the ray? F_sample take as an input one point (x,d) or all points on the ray?\n4. It is quite difficult to understand formula (4). it looks like  F_sample was change to NyperNet. What is an input to Hypernetwork and what is an input to F_sample? Such formula should be describe more carefully. \n5. Figure 2 is completely unclear.\n6. Authors write, \"While this method can be adapted to a variety of NeRF-based systems (Sec. 4.4), we focus on its application on the vanilla NeRF in this section.\" and then directly built the method on formula (3) dedicated to Generalizable NeRF.\n7.
