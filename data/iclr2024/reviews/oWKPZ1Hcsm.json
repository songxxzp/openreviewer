Some paragraph is confusing and hard to follow due to poor organization. Especially in Section 4 and Section 5, the important conclusion in these paragraphs need to be highlighted and summarized. In Section 5, the transition from Monte Carlo (MC) pretraining to emphasizing both actor and critic regularization is perplexing, especially since these regularization are not introduced in the methods section. And the title \"Application to Adroit Environments\" is incongruous as the methodology differs from the prior parts.\n\n* The two parts of pretraining and regularization that the authors want to underscore appear to be incremental additions rather than naturally integrated components. This disjointed presentation detracts from the coherence of the paper and needs to be addressed.\n\n* Regarding the methodology, the paper's primary emphasis appears to be on the use of Monte Carlo (MC) estimates as pretraining targets. However, the results in Appendix A.3 indicate that the efficiency and performance during pretraining stem from the Behavioral Cloning (BC) loss rather than MC. MC only contributes to stability during subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, in Section 5, the authors assert that pretraining is less critical than both regularization techniques. Consequently, I am unconvinced about the significance of this work.\n\n*  The experiments are also limited in variety of dataset types and domains. For instance, BC pretraining may depend on data quality; therefore, additional dataset types such as \"medium-replay\" and \"random\" datasets are necessary to substantiate the importance of this work. Moreover, further ablation studies are required to validate the paper's claims. Current results in Figures 3, 5, and 6, which only base on a single dataset, are unconvincing. Additionally, the inclusion of more domains, such as AntMaze, would be beneficial."

This works propose to bridge the supervised approach and the off-policy approach aiming for a more stable offline RL. The key innovation is the pre-training of the critic using a supervised Monte-Carlo value-error, which leverages information from offline data. This step provides a consistent actor and critic for off-policy TD-learning. The experiments on D4RL MuJoCo benchmark show that the proposed method is more stable and efficient during the offline training comparing with other method, such as behavior cloning and TD3.  Meanwhile the results in Adroit shows the proposed method can achieve good performance for most of the tasks."
