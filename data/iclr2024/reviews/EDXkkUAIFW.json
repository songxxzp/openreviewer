Only DIAM was published in the past two years. Some recent Deep AL method is missing in the empirical evaluation. \n\nFurthermore, the benchmark datasets evaluated in the paper are somehow simple.

In the empirical setting part, I'm confused about the setting of *50 distinct architectures*. Since it's noted in the footnote that all the experiments were conducted with the same GPU and CPU, I'm wondering whether it's still necessary to employ such method?\n3.
