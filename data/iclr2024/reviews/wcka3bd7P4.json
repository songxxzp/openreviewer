This observation raises curiosity about the specific conditions or types of datasets under which FROND demonstrates significant performance improvements. Clarification on this matter would greatly enhance the reader\u2019s understanding and application of FROND in various contexts.\n\nTo further highlight the strengths of FROND and to provide clearer guidance on its optimal application scenarios, I would recommend conducting additional evaluations on datasets that necessitate long-range interactions[1]. \n\nThe content in section 3.3 offers valuable insights, and I believe it could be enriched with additional technical details and formulations related to the graph layer. This enhancement would aid readers in developing a more comprehensive and profound understanding of the model.\n\n\nDrawing a more explicit connection between fractal characteristics and FROND\u2019s efficacy, particularly in handling tree-like data, would contribute to a more coherent narrative and justification for the framework.

It appears that Maskey et al. 2023 approach also tackles oversmoothing via long-range dependency of the dynamics, which is the main theoretical justification of the current work as well. More specifically, are there simple examples in which one framework strictly encapsulates another? Most importantly, what is the advantage of using this framework over Maskey et al. 2023 framework? \n\nI understand fast mixing of graph random walk results of Chung 1997 and its dependence on various factors, such as eigenvalues of the adjacency/Laplacian. However, it is not immediately clear to me that the same fast rate carries over to graph neural ODE (which has some kind of skip connection across depths). Can this be explained more thoroughly?\n\nIs it possible to give a proof sketch/intuition of Theorem 2, in particular, why should we expect the slow algebraic rate? It is also interesting that the rate is tight. Following the proof in the appendix seems to suggest that this come from a deeper result by Mainardi but there is not a lot of intuition there.\n\nMinor issues:\nM1: F(s) in equation (1) is not defined (I assume it is the Laplace transform of f). The variable s is also not defined (I assume it is the variable of the transformed function). \nM2: There should also be conditions under which the Laplace transform exists (and the Laplace transform of the derivative)\n\n---\nAfter the rebuttal phase, the authors have addressed my concerns and I am raising my score to an 8."

Missing graph ODE literature: recent papers like 'Anti-Symmetric DGN: a stable architecture for Deep Graph Networks' and 'Ordinary differential equations on graph networks'.\n\n3. In one of the main contributions, it is said that \"We provide an interpretation from the perspective of a non-Markovian graph random walk when the model feature-updating dynamics is inspired by the fractional heat diffusion process. Contrasting with the traditional Markovian random walk implicit in traditional graph neural diffusion models whose convergence to the stationary equilibrium is exponentially swift, we establish that in FROND, convergence follows an algebraic rate.\". Why is it true? if $\\beta=2$ then the process is not diffusive at all. Rather, it is oscillatory, as shown in GraphCON (Rusch et al.)\n\n4. In section 2.3, the authors should also discuss FLODE ('A Fractional Graph Laplacian Approach to Oversmoothing') which is very similar to this work and also uses fractional calculus.\n\n5. In section 3.1 the authors discuss the initial conditions of the ODE. It is not clear to me how do you initialize $\\beta$ time steps. From the text I can infer that it is the same condition as the input features. Is that was was actually done? If so, does it make sense from an ODE perspective? Have the authors tried other initialization procedures?\n\n6. The authors mention that here only $\\beta$ is only considered between 0 and 1. I wonder why. How would your model behave theoretically and practically if it larger than 1?\n\n7. I am not sure it is correct that the model can have global or 'full path' properties if $\\beta$ is smaller than 1. For example, I think it is fair to say that if $beta$ is indeed smaller than 1, then a second order process as in GraphCON cannot be represented by the model. \n\n8. The experiments indeed show that the proposed method improves compared to baselines produced by the authors, but they are quite narrow and show a partial picture of the current state of the art and existing methods. I would expect that the authors compare their work (experimentally) with other methods like FLODE, CDE, GRAND++, as well as other recent methods like ACMII-GCN++ ('Is Heterophily A Real Nightmare For Graph Neural Networks To Do Node Classification?') or DRew ('DRew: Dynamically Rewired Message Passing with Delay').\n\n9. The authors state that the proposed method can be applied to any ordinary differential equation GNN, so can the authors please also show the results when applied to other baseline methods as discussed in the paper?\n\n10. $\\beta$ is a hyperparameter. What would happen if you learn it? how will it influence the results and the stability of your solver? Is there a principles way to choosing the hyperparameter?\n\n11. I am not certain that the method is novel, as it was also shown in 'Fractional Graph Convolutional Networks (FGCN) for Semi-Supervised Learning'.\n\n12. Missing literature about skip connections in GNNs: 'Understanding convolution on graphs via energies'.\n\n13. A general point - the focus of the paper is the mitigation of oversmoothing. But, also as the authors state, there are many methods that already do it. Then my question is what is the added value of using this mechanism ? Also, another important issue is oversquashing in graphs. Can the authors discuss how and if would the proposed method can help with that issue?"
