                "value": "This paper proposes FLAN, or FLow Attention for NAS, a neural predictor that incorporates a unified architecture encoding scheme to enable prediction across different NAS search spaces. The unified encoding is a mix of several unsupervised methods, like Arch2vec, CATE, and Zero-Cost Proxies, while the GNN predictor incorporates new mechanisms to potentially overcome the oversmoothing problem. Several design components of FLAN are ablated, and transfer tests are performed with an emphasis on sample efficiency."

Figures 1-3 especially are nicely done.\nThere is detailed ablation on the design aspects of FLAN. Transfer experiments are performed, as is search."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The are issues with the contributions and statements made in this manuscript:\n\nFirst, DGF: The author's point out that \"GCNs are prone to an over-smoothing problem\", although really this issue affects Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in general. The author's then attempt to validate the efficacy of FLAN's predictor using the DGF and GAT in Table 1. I am not convinced by these experiments. GCN was proposed in 2016 and since then other GNN-types like GAT, GIN [1], GATv2 [2], etc., all of whose manuscripts demonstrate a superiority over GCN, so its no surprise that for FLOW, GAT > GCN. Also, it is unclear whether the DGF module used actually solves the oversmoothing mechanism at all. A simpler explanation is that adding skip-connections and more weights simply leads to better performance. Thus, results in Table 1 are inconsistent and do little to alleviate this concern, and it seems this paper cannot decide if it wants to be about correcting GNN problems or neural predictors in NAS.\n\nSecond, Unified Encodings for transferable NAS prediction. The author's cite Multi-Predict and GENNAPE. Given the focus on cell-based NAS, there is related work in this field called CDP [3] that is older than Multi-Predict/GENNAPE (both recent 2023 papers), but the authors seem unaware of. The form of encoding in this paper is weaker than related work for three reasons: First, there is no guarantee an architecture encoding will be unique as it possible for two different architectures to have almost the same ZCP scores/latency/FLOPs/etc. but be different structurally. 'Score-based' is a better descriptor for this encoding and I think the authors would be better off emphasizing that term to describe their method. Second, the use of \"unique numerical indices\" limits FLAN to a small number of predetermined search spaces so it cannot address the need to \"validate NAS improvement without incurring the large compute cost of performing NAS on a new search space\". Finally, the statement \"However, search on a global graph structure\u2014one that encompasses all NNs\u2014can be an intractable search problem due to its size.\" is very weak. Large search spaces have never been an impediment even for early NAS methods [4][5], and it is still possible to perform search within cell-based NAS-Benchmarks even if using transferable encodings like CDP or GENNAPE.\n\nThird, experimental inferences are not supported by the tables/figures. E.g., Fig. 4 t-SNE plots, specifically \"In contrast, CATE doesn\u2019t exhibit such distinct clusters, instead scattering NNs according to their computational complexity.\" Actually, the CATE plot shows a large number of individual clusters per search space, and the clusterings for each search space are close to each other. I am skeptical of making strong claims like that on a t-SNE plot as its very hard to interpret what each axis is measuring. Also, in Sec. 5, \"Score-based encodings typically help prediction with low sample count but there are diminishing returns with more training samples\". In Table 2 FLAN_{ZCP} sweeps performance for NB101 and ENAS, yet loses to TAGATES at the lowest data percent; also, the ZCP row itself does not boast impressive performance, but still monotonically increases with \\%samples.\n\nResults in Tables 3/4 do not instil confidence given the goal this paper is trying to solve. For Table 3, On NASBench-101, DARTS and ENAS (FixWD) FLAN+ZCP dominates all the time, less so on NASBench-201 and DARTS_{FixWD}, and for Table 4, it only dominates on ENAS<->DARTS. For a method that targets transferability when few samples in the Target search space are available, you would expect it to either dominate quite conclusively, or be able to provide reasoning why the best setting changing depending on the transfer target. That is, when the method is deployed in an actual scenario where you actually do not have a lot of labeled data (whereas here, you are just artificially limiting the amount), some inference can be made about which predictor configuration (+Arch2Vec, +CATE, +ZCP or +CAZ) is the best fit, given the Target dataset. \nThe lack of either of these mutes the usefulness of FLOW. \n\nNext, NAS search results are not impressive. The author's deliberately limit themselves to cell-based benchmarks where there is a wealth of literature, but mostly on CIFAR-10. Unlike CDP they do not even evaluate on ImageNet, much less other tasks where the utility of NAS should be aimed.\n\nFinally, the presentation in mixed. The introduction and related work are easy and nice to read, but beyond that, the writing is subpar, especially in Section 4.1 when describing the GNN/DGF. Floats from Table 1 onwards (DF+GAT x NB201 typo) leave a lot to be desired.\nE.g., Figure 4 is a mess: Text is way too small and there are red dots which seemingly have no label in the legend. If the author's are that insistent on plotting out these many search spaces they should make use of different colors and marker shapes to help distinguish search spaces. Figures 5 and 6 use different marker shapes but its too small, some are the same color, and just generally difficult to make stuff out. Also, less is more - plots should have fewer entries, only several important variants so the viewer can actually see what is going on. \n\nIn summary, this paper starts off good with its writing, only to start making incorrect/unsupported statements/inferences in the methodology and results sections. This culminates in a very dense results section that fails to instill confidence in the efficacy of the proposed method should it be used down the line. For these reasons I recommend rejection of this manuscript.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Xu et al., \"How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?\" In ICLR 2019.\n\n[2] Brody, Alon and Yahav. \"How Attentive are Graph Attention Networks?\" In ICLR 2022.\n\n[3] Liu et al., \"Bridge the Gap Between Architecture Spaces via A Cross-Domain Predictor\", in NeurIPS 2022. \n\n[4] Zoph and Le. \"Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning.\" In ICLR 2017.\n\n[5] Bender et al., \"Can Weight-Sharing Outperform Random Architecture Search?

Maybe I understood this wrong, but would the choice of operations index for a search space impact the predictions when transferring to a new search space? For example, if search space A and B are similar, while search space A and C more distinct, would using index say 1, 2 and 10 for A, B and C, respectively, be a more reasonable choice than using 1, 10 and 2? Or is this invariant to the index choice?\n\n- Did authors evaluate their simple NAS method in section 5 (Table 5) on other search spaces except NAS-Bench-101?\n\n- In Table 4 it seems that the performance of FLAN + ZCP, almost in all settings, especially ENAS -> DARTS and vice verca, deteriorates as you increase the number of samples.
