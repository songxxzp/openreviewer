At the moment it looks like an approach to extend DrNAS, but at least DARTS and/or GDAS (or more recent TE-NAS) should have been considered.\n\n-  On the macro search space, it would make sense to consider a macro approach and then introduce the cell-based part of the proposed method. It's not clear what the reference is for measuring the improvement. Nevertheless, the comparison with existing methods is useful. \n\n- (Major limitation) This is a benchmark driven approach. It would therefore be useful to include the latest results on NAS, e.g. from Lukasik, Jovita, Steffen Jung and Margret Keuper. \"Learning where to look - generative NAS is surprisingly efficient.\" European Computer Vision Conference. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland, 2022. Then it would also be helpful to discuss why and when the paper lacks performance compared to the latest state-of-the-art approaches. For example, on the DARTS search space (Table 4), the current SOTA is much lower than the paper's results (the cited paper or TE-NAS, for example, perform better). It is therefore important to compare with the latest approaches and possibly improve on their setup.\n\n- Clarity: The method re-defines the parts of the search space. For example, the superset search space and edge definition are missing. In general, the method would benefit from a section defining this problem."
