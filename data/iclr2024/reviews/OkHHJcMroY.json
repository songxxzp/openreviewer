Since the paper claims the algorithms they propose achieve the first $O(1/K)$ convergence rate ($K$ is the number of\niterations) with constant step-sizes for PE with nonlinear function approximation, it is better to give some brief statistical intuition of achieving this result.  \n\n2. The paper proposes a new metric for convergence performance, and gives the abundant explanation for using this concept, but it is hard to be applied to other performance metric, for example, $|\\widehat{V}^{\\pi}(s) - V^{\\pi}(s)|$, where $\\widehat{V}^{\\pi}$ is the estimate you get from a policy evaluation problem."

                "value": "1. From Corollary 1, the sample complexity of PILOT is $O(\\sqrt{M}\\kappa^3\\epsilon^{-1} +M)$, where $M$ is the number of state-action pairs sampled by the evaluated policy, and $\\epsilon$ measures the error under the new metric of convergence performance in this paper. Intuitively, to get a accurate estimate of the $V^{\\pi}$, we need a sufficient number of samples (a big $M$). However, it seems that this $\\epsilon$ has nothing to do with $M$. Additionally, I have noticed that the Assumption 1 needs $M$ to be sufficiently large. Can authors give the detailed justification of this explanation? I would like to see how $M$ will affect the accuracy of the policy evaluation.\n\n\n2. For the sample complexity of the algorithm, the first term $O(\\sqrt{M}\\kappa^3\\epsilon^{-1})$ seems redundant, because the total number of samples is fixed, i.e., $M$, and in this paper the first term of sample complexity comes from sampling from this dataset, and this operation does not increase the sample complexity (it will not interact with the environment). Therefore, I think PILOT+ accually saves the computational cost, not sample complexity of PILOT. Can authors explain this concept more carefully?"
