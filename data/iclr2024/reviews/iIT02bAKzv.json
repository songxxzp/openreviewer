Traditional global pruning methods are costly, and recent layer-wise pruning approaches lack a global perspective. To overcome this, the paper introduces Efficient Coarse-to-Fine Layer-Wise Pruning (ECoFLaP), a two-stage approach that leverages global importance scores for determining sparsity ratios and then performs efficient layer-wise weight pruning. The computation of global importance scores is achieved using the zeroth-order approximate gradient through a forward-forward algorithm.   ECoFLaP demonstrates significant performance improvements in both multimodal and single-modal models, particularly in high-sparsity scenarios. Notably, it achieves these improvements while using only 40% of GPU memory compared to backpropagation and maintaining competitive accuracy."
