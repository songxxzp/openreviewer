Two algorithms are proposed with corresponding bounds on the (Bayesian) regret and (Bayesian) query complexity. The novelty lies at the application of randomization into the algorithm design in the preference-based feedback setup, making the algorithm more computationally efficient. It shows that there is a trade-off between the regret and the query times, i.e., more queries lead to less regret. The relationship is quantitatively characterized in the main results in terms of the parameter $\\beta$."

The proof technique is very routine and it is hard for me to see novelty here. There are a large body of theoretical works based on linear MDP and using model-free algorithms. The author didn't have a concrete comparison with them. Extension to nonlinear function approximation using eluder dimension is fairly well-known as well. People know for a while the only known function class for smaller eluder dimension is linear and generalized linear. There are many more general complexity measures for RL: Bellman-Eluder, Decision-Estimation Coefficient, bilinear class. The appendix is very long. I feel it might not be good to prove everything from scratch. There are so many prior works and I might suggest the authors to query existing lemma as much as possible to respect prior works.\n\n2. This work is far away from the practical RLHF use case. There is no experiment at all and the algorithm seems to be practically feasible. For example, it is unclear how to implement LLM fine-tuning through RLHF using algorithm 2. It is also unclear why we care about cumulative regret in the context of RLHF for LLM alignment."
