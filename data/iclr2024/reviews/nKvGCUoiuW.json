However, it is typically expected that LLMs should discern users\u2019 intentions based solely on text inputs (dialogue history). As presented in Table 5, the addition of these explicit identifiers results in a relatively marginal performance improvement (from an average of 48.6 to 49.8). It is worth noting that if users are required to explicitly select a task, a system could alternatively leverage state-of-the-art specialized methods at a potentially lower cost. For example, BEIT-3 (2B params) could be used for Visual Question Answering with an 84% accuracy, X-VLM (500M+) for grounding achieving ~92 on the RefCOCO+ testA, and Co-DETR (348M) for object detection with COCO mAP of 66. These specialized methods may present a more optimal choice compared to the proposed MiniGPT-V2.\n\nFurthermore, the paper proposes a three-stage training strategy with increasing image resolution. It is important to note that similar strategies have been adopted in recent works, such as Lynx and Qwen-VL. The authors also suggest a new integration of Visual Transformer (ViT) outputs, achieved by concatenating every four adjacent visual tokens into a single token. This method is proposed to reduce the sequence length, akin to the Resamplers, and the manuscript would benefit from an ablation study to substantiate the efficacy of this approach."

This model serves as a unified interface, enhancing the handling of various vision-language tasks. Unique identifiers for different tasks are incorporated during the training phase, aiding the model in easily distinguishing between task instructions and boosting learning efficiency for each specific task. Following a three-stage training process, MiniGPT-v2 demonstrates robust performance across several visual question answering and visual grounding benchmarks, outperforming other generalist vision-language models.
