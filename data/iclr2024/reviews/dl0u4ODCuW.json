To take such cases into consideration, can the authors also evaluate performance using two other metrics: the success rate as in Retro*, and the set-wise exact match accuracy as in FusionRetro?\n3. How sensitive the method is to the number of samples when computing line 4-6 in Algorithm 1?\n4. It is interesting to see retro-fallback with transformer can be more computational efficient, and the authors elaborate more on that (e.g., how to combine both for improvement)?"

The reviewer might have misunderstood something, but the problem described in Section   4.1 could easily avoided if the authors used a hash table for implementing the search algorithms.\n(Using a hash table is a standard technique for proof-number search.)\nIf a hash table is used, a cycle could be easily detected, so it is possible to avoid problems caused by the same molecule or reaction appearing multiple times in a path.\n\n1. P. 1.\n\"Although existing algorithms may find multiple synthesis plans, they are generally not designed to do so, and there is no reason to expect the plans found will be suitable as backup plans (e.g. they may share steps with the primary plan and thereby fail alongside it).\"\\\nThe following paper proposes an AND-OR-tree-based search algorithm for retrosynthesis, which keeps enumerating (probably) all the synthetic routes one by one in the order of some preference.\n> Shibukawa, R., Ishida, S., Yoshizoe, K. et al.
