Random walk is one of the important research topic in graph, the fundamental research is worthy of applause. Random walk related approaches have also be applied in downstream tasks in the real-world applications, such as graph embedding and community detection. However, the focus of this paper seems to be more fundamental. Random walk theoretical research usually fits better in venues like graph theory (lean more on mathematics) and computing theory (e.g., STOC). So I have concern on audience interest for ICLR. \n\nC2. More real-world related applications are expected. The authors applied the proposed random walk mechanism in three applications. But the three seem to be more abstract than those driven by real-world applications or hot topics in the current research community. For example, graph kernel approximation covers one major category of approaches for graph embedding. PageRank vector approximation is also one of the fundamental problems for graph embedding and community detection. Graphlet detection is used in subgraph representation. Compared to the three in this paper, graph embedding, subgraph representation, and community detection may be closer to real-world scenario. In recent 10 years, deep learning approaches attract more attentions in almost every research field. If the fundamental research like this paper can show enhancement against recent so-called advanced methods or benefit the recent popular approaches, that would be more exciting.\n\n=================\n\nAfter reading the authors response where more examples were involved. The response address some of my concerns. But more real-world related applications are expected (C2 in my review) in this paper. \n\nAs a result, I increased my score."

For instance, the reduction in approximation errors when estimating PageRank using both standard and repelling random walks as shown in Table 2 is relatively minor.\n\nW2.  The validity of certain arguments is heavily dependent on specific assumptions. Take Theorem 4.2, for example: its accuracy hinges on the assumption that the count of random walks is less than the minimum node degree in the provided graph. Nonetheless, in a variety of real-world network structures, the minimum node degree stands at one, rendering repelling random walks virtually indistinguishable from standard random walks. \n\nW3. The paper's presentation needs improvements. The current manuscript contains ambiguous sentences and unclear notations. For instance: \n- Page 2: the notation $P^{(i)}$ requires clarification, as the paper defines $P$ but not $P^{(i)}$. \n- Page 3: the notation $i_1$ and $\\delta_{i_1}$ require clarifications. \n- In the appendix on Page 20: the reasoning behind the statement \"only walkers originating from the same node are correlated\" requires additional explanation.\n\n--- \nDuring the rebuttal phase, the authors and I engaged in detailed discussions regarding the novelty and contributions of the paper. I appreciate that the authors have effectively addressed the issue related to the minimum node degree assumption (i.e., W2). We also had a thorough discussion about the fundamental differences between Repelling Random Walk and Radar Push, a closely related work. The authors' responses were not only prompt but also convincing. Consequently, I have decided to revise my initial score from 5 to 6."
