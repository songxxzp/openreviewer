TAFS is capable of efficiently searching for and discovering new, effective activation functions within GNN applications. Firstly, for the search space of activation functions, TAFS introduces a continuous latent space equipped with a general approximator that includes an additional smoothness constraint. Specifically, TAFS utilizes a MLP to approximate the optimal activation function, where the parameters of the MLP are optimized as part of the search space, incorporating a Jacobian regularization term. Secondly, employing stochastic relaxation techniques, the search space is reparameterized with a Gaussian distribution, shifting the optimization target from the parameters of the activation function to those of the Gaussian distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on node and link-level tasks demonstrate that this method achieves excellent performance."

In the text, \"... and demote by \u00afw_\u03b4 all the parameters of GNN, \u2026\", the word \"demote\" appears to be misspelled.\n\n4.

In Figure 4, subfigure (a) shows that larger values of K yield better results but at a slower pace, demonstrating a \"trade-off between accuracy and computation time.\" Is the Y-axis in (a) representing accuracy?

From the experimental results, the performance of TAFS needs to be improved.
