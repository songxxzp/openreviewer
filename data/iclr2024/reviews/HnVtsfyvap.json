                "value": "The paper presents a method called \"task-oriented knowledge transfer\" for training smaller, task-specific models by leveraging knowledge from large Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). This approach involves three steps:\n\n1. Fine-tuning the VFM on the target task using labeled data.\n2. Transferring knowledge from the fine-tuned VFM to the target model using an unlabeled dataset (transfer set) based on the knowledge distillation framework.\n3. Fine-tuning the target model with labeled target task data.\n\nAn alternative method, called \"task-agnostic knowledge transfer\", involves distilling knowledge from the frozen VFM image encoder to the target model image encoder and then fine-tuning the target model using labeled data. \n\nThe paper makes a comparison of task-oriented knowledge transfer with task-agnostic transfer, direct web-scale CLIP pretraining, and supervised ImageNet-1k pretraining. The authors show that the task-oriented knowledge transfer method performs better on many benchmarks.\n\nThe study also emphasizes the importance of the transfer set, where using a transfer set with an image distribution similar to the target task image distribution leads to better performance. For cases where a large target task-related transfer set is not readily available, the paper proposes a solution: curating task-related transfer sets using image retrieval with images from the limited labeled target task dataset as queries. Authors show that this method improved segmentation performance when compared to using a generic transfer set."

Under the setup the authors consider, the proposed approach is the most straightforward approach one could consider. While the investigation of the use of not in-domain transfer dataset is interesting, the finding \u2014 when sufficient in amount, in-domain transfer set is better \u2014 is somewhat expected (e.g prior work[1] on open-set semi-supervised learning has shown that out-of-domain example can hurt performance of semi-supervised algorithm). It would be more interesting if the authors investigated the use of data from different domains (medical, satellite, clipart, etc) for distillation and proposed a strategy for selecting the right data for distillation. The current submission does contain some investigation on selecting the right data for distillation (section 3.5), but the investigation is not thorough enough to convince the reviewer that their strategy is applicable for different target tasks and with data from different domains. \n2. Problematic Baselines: One would consider using the task-agnostic approach if fine-tuning the pre-trained models could be an issue (perhaps due to compute-constraint) but since the authors only consider compute-constraint during inference (instead of training), it seems unnatural to consider task-agnostic distillation as a baseline. In addition, the CLIP-pretrain baseline is trained on an internal dataset. Without knowing the distribution/statistics of the data and how the dataset compares to CC3M or DataComp-1B, it is difficult to understand whether the CLIP-pretrain baseline is worse because contrastive pretraining is not the right approach or the data used for training is flawed \n\nCitation:\n[1] Saito, Kuniaki, Donghyun Kim, and Kate Saenko. \"Openmatch: Open-set semi-supervised learning with open-set consistency regularization.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 25956-25967."

Have the authors tried distilling from the patch tokens from CLIP? \n\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Additional baseline: CLIP is a weakly supervised pre-training approach, the reviewer recommends adding self-supervised pre-training approaches such as DINO.\n2. Transfer set: The use of not in-domain transfer set is worth more explanation. Right now, there is not much explanation/description on the use of not in-domain transfer set (e.g. why an in-domain transfer set is difficult to obtain).\n3. Distillation mechanism: Distilling patch features is important for the segmentation task. However, there are only a few sentences describing the process. The reviewer recommends expanding the section on loss function either via using equations (the use of contrastive loss for distillation is uncommon) or by providing a figure explaining the process. \n\nPre-rebuttal rating: Overall, the paper contains some interesting investigations on how to use distillation for constructing a small model from a large model pre-trained on different source tasks. However, the investigations are so far incomplete and the quality is not up to par with ICLR\u2019s standards. The reviewer thus recommends rejecting the submission."
