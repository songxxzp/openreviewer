                "value": "There is nothing new in this paper for the ICLR community. The learning mechanisms are known, the problem is known. The only thing that is new is the identification of the \"key points\". However, I am not aware of any recent papers in the operations research (OR) community that does not use \"key points\" to solve packing problems. It is entirely obvious that these points must be used. I am not an expert on container packing, so I admit that I do not know if there is a proof out there that these points will lead to an optimal solution. However, I know enough about the problem to confidently say this paper has no place at ICLR. Accepting this paper would constitute running around the OR reviewers who are experts at this domain and can definitely say whether this is an interesting proof or not. The proof has literally no bearing on learning: the \"key points\" are essential to any heuristic (or exact) technique. I encourage the authors to submit to a journal like EJOR or C&OR where packing problems have been a focus of many works.\n\nI am also not sure about the application in this paper being all that important or relevant. The bin packing problem typically seeks to minimize the total number of bins used, the metaphor being packing trailers for trucks, or containers for airplanes or ships. Minimizing the height (or any dimension, really, since it is irrelevant which one is minimized) is not a problem type I am familiar with.\n\nAnother note on the experiments: these just use a bunch of randomly generated instances. Multiple benchmarks for bin packing exist (e.g., Bischoff and Ratcliff (1995) and Davies and Bischoff (1999) just to name two). Why not use these? Real problems generally have some structure to them and are not just a bunch of random things thrown together in a container.\n\nFinally, I would like to point out the tautological title that can only be considered clever if we ignore the fact that the authors literally call the points \"key points\" and then say they are key... because they are key points."

                "value": "1. The concept of KP proposed by the authors and their attempt to provide some proofs based on this concept are presented in a rough and overly complex manner. \nFor instance, IS = (R3 \u2212 U), where R3 is not defined in the paper, and the physical meaning of IS should also be elucidated. \nIn Definition 1, the key point is symbolically defined, yet there is a lack of detailed illustration, insight, or algorithm design for computing the key point. It's difficult for readers to grasp the concept of the key point and determine if it's a reasonable design\u2014for instance, whether it might lead to infeasible solutions or if the computational complexity of the KP algorithm itself is too high. \nIn the appendix, the authors provide proofs related to KP, but the overly symbolic expressions appear confusing and tiresome. Perhaps outlining their insights might alleviate the readers' burden. \nThe authors should reorganize their presentation to make their core contribution precise and succinct. If they enhance the clarity of their article, I would consider raising the score.\n\n2. The authors' contribution seems overly emphasized, given that offline packing methods (such as attend2pack, RCQL) and candidate-based packing methods (Zhao et al. (2021a)) have already been introduced. Moreover, I noticed that the authors' method largely draws from these existing works during the implementation process. The authors' contribution solely introduces a new heuristic rule, KP, and I believe these limited contributions might struggle to meet the standard for acceptance at ICLR.\n\n3. Restricting the action space is a sound approach, as verified in existing works (Zhao et al. (2021a)) and observed in our own practice. I'm surprised to see that KP outperforms action designs like EMS and EV with an average of only 16.7 valid action counts. I'm also curious why EP and EMS perform equally, as in previous research, EMS had significantly outperformed EP. While examining the authors' code, I noticed they only submitted their own work's code and did not provide the baseline code. I believe submitting all baseline code for verification is necessary to assess the correctness of the authors' conclusions."
