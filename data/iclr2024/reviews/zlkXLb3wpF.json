They come at the cost of additional forward and backward passes through the normalizing flow at hand. The present paper reduces this computational overhead to compute path gradient of reverse KL, while being analytically equal to previous work. It then provides a new path gradient estimator for the forward KL. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting path gradient estimators work both in the forward and reverse KL setting on physical sciences data sets (where the unnormalized $p(x)$ is known)."

Allowing the forward KL to make use of the unnormalized density is attractive, as the forward KL may have better properties than reverse KL (mode covering instead of mode seeking)."

                "value": "Generally, the presentation interpretation of the results can be greatly improved. I also have concerns on some of the results.\n\nIn detail:\n\n1. The notation of Proposition 3.2 and its proof in the appendix are sloppy and I cannot determine the correctness: what is the inverse of the rectangular matrix $\\frac{\\partial f_\\theta(x_l^t, x_l^c)}{\\partial x_l^t}$? Is it a pseudo-inverse, or is it a part of the network Jacobian? I suggest to greatly rewrite this proposition as a Theorem that outlines the general idea of the recursion (that the path gradient can be constructed iteratively by vector-Jacobian products with the inverse of each block, if I am right). Then proceed to derive concrete realizations for coupling blocks and affine couplings in particular if they allow for unique results.\n2. What is the cost of computing Proposition 3.2? As I mentioned in the first point, by rewriting the recursion more generally, this could easily be showcased.\n3. What is the intuition behind Proposition 4.1? What is the regularization obtained from including the unnormalized density (probably something like the corrected relative weight of each sample according to the ground truth density)?\nWhat derivative vanishes in expectation? How large is the variance of the removed gradient term? Is your result an improvement in this metric? What is the regularizing effect? Vaitl et al. 2022b have useful visualizations and explanations in this regard.\n4. The baseline Algorithm 2 should not be used to measure baseline times. The second forward pass through the network is unneccessary, as one can simply store the result from the first forward pass, once with stop_gradient and once without. Please report Table 2 again with this change.\n5. I have strong doubts on the validity of the experiment on the multimodal gaussian model. It is hard to believe that a standard RealNVP network cannot be trained effectively on this data, with an ESS_p of 0.0(!). I see several warning signs that a bad performing network has been selected in order to have a badly performing baseline:\n\t- the network is huge, with a number of parameters bounded from below by six coupling blocks $\\times$ five hidden subnetworks $\\times$ (1000 $\\times$ 1000 entries in each weigh matrix) amounting to more than 30 million parameters;\n\t- the batch size of 4,000 given 10,000 samples makes the network see almost the entire data set in every update.\n  This indicates that the training is set up in a way that training from samples only must fail. Given that training yields useful models in only five minutes, it is reasonable to expect hyperparameter tuning of the baseline model from the authors.\n6. In this light, how much parameter tuning was involved in the other experiments $\\phi^4$ and $U(1)$? Please compare your numbers to the state of the art results on these benchmarks.\n\n\nGiven that the theoretical results need improved presentation and explanation, and given the doubts on the numerical experiments, the manuscript does not reach the quality ICLR in the current form. Many of the proposed changes can be achieved with additional explanations and better notation. I am looking forward to the author's rebuttal, happy to be corrected on my understanding.\n\n\n\n## Minor comments:\n\n- Eq. (13) is missing a logarithm.\n- The caption for Figure 1 is on page 21 in the appendix, took me some time.\n- The statement that building up the computation graph takes measurable time is false, as this simply means storing already  computed activations in a dictionary (right before section 3.1).\n- Eq. (25) is missing that $p_{\\theta, 0}$ can be computed from the unnormalized density.\n- If a reader is not familiar with the terms forward and reverse KL, it is hard to understand the introduction. Point the reader to Section 2 or drop it here, leaving space for more explanations on theoretical results."

                "value": "I have a naive question about computing the pathwise gradient of the\nreverse KL. In equation (2), it seems to me that we could rewrite the\nequation by using the Jacobian of the forward transform based on the\ninverse function theorem, so that the $+\\log |\\textup{det} ~ dT^{-1}/dx|$ term\nbecomes $- \\log |\\textup{det}~dT/dx_0|$. Then we could compute the quantity and\nuse backprop to get the pathwise gradient. Am I misunderstanding, or\nwhy would this not work? Is the computation of the Jacobian too\ncostly?\n\n\"Path gradients have the appealing property that they are unbiased and\nhave lower variance compared to standard estimators, thereby promising\naccelerated convergence (Roeder et al., 2017; Agrawal et al., 2020;\nVaitl et al., 2022a;b).\"  -> Other estimators are also unbiased. The\nsentence makes it seem like they aren't. Also, the \"have lower\nvariance\" is not always true. I suggest revising to make the sentence\ncorrect, e.g., making it \"tend to have lower variance\"."
