This allows the model to leverage the benefits of hyperbolic geometry, like hierarchical representations and dimensionality reduction.\n\n- An approach to estimate the hyperbolicity of datasets using Gromov delta-hyperbolicity is presented.

The paper does not explain and analyze why negative sampling harms the performance of the hyperbolic model, which does not occur in the Euclidean model.\n4. The paper does not optimize the model with the compatibility of data with hyperbolic space, though it tries to obtain a more accurate estimation of the curvature of hyperbolic space. The role of curvature is not fully used in the recommendation design.\n5. The authors state to apply hyperbolic geometry in the sequence learning settings.

The addition of this paper is the extension of SASRec with a hyperbolic layer as stated at the last sentence Section 5. I am not sure how much originality is there.\n\nAs mentioned previously, it would be great if the authors could add some references from recent works of recommender systems on real use-cases just to contrast it with the current SOTA in real applications. Do we expect that such an approach would be viable or would give better online results in a real system?\n\nIn Section 3.2 authors mention that negative sampling is typically implemented using uniform sampling which is rarely the case for real use cases where one employs heuristics in order to sample hard negatives and learn more robust models.\n\nI do not understand the statement \"distributional properties of items based on the popularity hierarchy\". What exactly someone would like to capture here? And why popularity cannot be captured with non-hyperbolic geometry?  I cannot see how this would help a recommendation system.\n\nIn the experimental part I would add the following baselines:\n- Most popular\n- Co-occurence baseline, where one would recommend the property that co-occurs more often with the last item in the sequence. This is often a very strong baseline.\n\nAdding challenging datasets also would be great. In recent years many datasets have been released that can be used for sequential recommendation. For example:\n- https://xmrec.github.io/wsdmcup/\n- https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/pkdd22-challenge-expediagroup\n\nGenerally the results are no convincing/great. It seems in some cases there is some slight improvement (third digit). And the classification in good and bad datasets is arbitrary. What is the hypothesis that in one dataset of Amazon data the hyperbolic version is better and in another one (like Products) is not better? This seems random."
