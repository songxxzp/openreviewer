In practice this is never known and the paper does not consider the case of a misspecified G. \n\nThe theoretical results are good but they rely on stringent assumptions (although possibly weaker than other works). In particular it seems that the sample efficiency results are specific to the case of an erdos-renyi graph. Furthermore, the methodology rules out complete graphs and in general requires a degree of sparsity in the underlying graph. Since G is given or estimated this could be enforced but possibly unpalatable in some cases. Furthermore, as with other approaches to interference using partitioning algorithm there is a trade off with statistical power."
