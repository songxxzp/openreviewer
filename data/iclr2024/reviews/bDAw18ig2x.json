These frequent exchanges of information result in a significant communication burden.\n\nThis paper proposes FEDBIF, a new technique for communication-efficient federated learning using bits freezing. Namely, in FEDBIF, the central server quantizes the model and sends it to the participating clients. Then, the clients perform local training on the quantized model, optimizing only chosen activated bits of the quantized model parameters (using virtual bits and STE). Finally, only the optimized bits are sent back to the server that aggregates the updates and updates the model parameters.\n\nComparison to several alternatives over three image classification tasks shows that FEDBIF performs well with less bandwidth (e.g., 4 bits for downlink and 1 bit for uplink) and even outperforms FedAVG."

(b) the evaluation uses 10 clients where all clients participate in all rounds. Such a small number of clients with full participation is expected in cross-silo FL where updates can be sent in both directions and there is no need to quantize model parameters. (c) the reported baseline accuracies are very low suggesting that the hyperparameters are not tuned. E.g., for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 the baseline accuracies are expected to be, e.g., 85+  and 65+ respectively (to the least and surely for the IID setup).

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) Several claims made in the introduction section are not well justified. \n\na) The downlink model updates are compressed in existing works because such quantization is not needed as the aggregated model parameters are already in the quantized domain. b) Quantization aware training is well-known in the literature [1]. c) The proposed method does not completely eliminate quantization error either. It is debatable whether the proposed method outperforms post-training quantitation and quantization aware training. \n\n\n2) Several key aspects of this paper are not well-developed. The paper claims FedBiF can outperform FedAvg because it achieves better generalization by limiting the growth of the model\u2019s Lipschitz constant. The Lipschitz constant of other quantization methods are not provided in Figure 6. It is not clear whether it is related to quantization in general or FedBiF itself. Furthermore, I think the Lipschitz constant is small due to the model sparsity that may be introduced by FedBiF. However, to my best knowledge, pruning methods typically do not guarantee better generalization in deep networks. One evidence is that CIFAR10 with ResNet18 can easily achieve above 90\\% accuracy [2] while the paper reports 75.2\\%. Therefore, the optimization implementation may not be sound and the results in Table 1 needs further study. Finally, the choice of activated bits are rather random and worth further investigation. After all, no theoretical analysis is provided. My advice is to study bit freezing without Federated Learning (FL) and carefully study its behavior in optimization before merging it with FL.\n\n3) I appreciate the author's acknowledgment of potential memory consumption issues in the appendix. Without their proposed trick of aggregating frozen bits, the memory consumption would become $m$ times that of the original local training. However, when bitwith increases, the memory consumption would also increase accordingly. Therefore, this limitation makes this method less attractive in practice as the local memory resources are very valuable. \n\n4) There's a typo: \"Sectoion 3.2\" should be \"Section 3.2\".\n\n[1] Training Deep Neural Networks with 8-bit Floating Point Numbers  \n[2] HeteroFL: Computation and Communication Efficient Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Clients"
