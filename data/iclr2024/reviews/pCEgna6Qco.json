This problem occurs when Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) lose their in-context learning abilities after being fine-tuned for a specific task. To elaborate, PLMs are initially fine-tuned for the task using soft prompt tuning, wherein only the soft prompt is tuned for that specific task. Then, all parameters, excluding the trained soft prompt, are fine-tuned for the same task. Experimental results show that ProMoT not only prevents the format specialziation but also enhances the performance on the target task."

Furthermore, experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in alleviating the issue of format specialization after being fine-tuned on the classification (RTE) and translation (WMT14 En-Fr) tasks.\n- **Clear Presentation;** This paper is well-written.

Multi-task training was done on only 2 tasks while it would be more informative to do it on a lot more tasks, results over multi-task 1-shot baseline are very mixed and is also missing 4-shot comparison.\n- Prefix + Parameter tuning baseline seems to be missing. What happens if you do both prefix and parameter tuning but don't use the prefix embedding for other tasks. This should be done in both single task and multi-task setting.\n- It would be good to include a prefix-tuning column. This would have some performance for the source task and same performance as the pre-trained model on other tasks.\n- It is hoped that the prefix-tuning stage learns the format. It would be good to empirically test this hypothesis. One simple experiment is to check if the prefix embedding outputs the source task format on other tasks.\n- Results on Palm 8B in the appendix don't look as promising and they should not be in the appendix but in the main paper. The approach seems to show worse performance than pre-trained model on other tasks after using the proposed approach. Would also be good to include 4-shot results here."
