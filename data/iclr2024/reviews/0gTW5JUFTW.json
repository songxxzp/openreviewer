They develop two simple MLP-based heads for topology generation, based on impressive detection performance. The proposed model, TopoMLP, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark and ranks 1st in the 1st OpenLane Topology in Autonomous Driving Challenge.

Using two simple MLP for the head is the core contribution I suppose. Is there any ablations to verify that using some complicated design (like a Transformer head) could \"downgrade\" the OLS score?\n\n2. Section 4.6 is a good contribution to the open-sourced community. Do authors communicate with organizers of the Challenge to reconsider the metric and maybe the leaderboard would be refreshed? On further consideration, the current OLS is a general metric. Is it good to design a separate metric to evaluate the topology performance at intersections (which is crucial I suppose)?\n\n3. This work generates the centerline of the lane, which is not the physical representation of the road scene. Is it a good formulation? On a higher level, I think the current form of Openlane-v2 tackles only partial challenges in the static road recognition. How to utilize the topoloy to faciliate downstream task? This could potentially trigger more future research in related domains.\n\n----\nMinor\n\n1. Topo in Figure 2. \"Topoogy\"\n2. G^LL in Equation 3 is the operation of Topology in Figure 2? I suggest to align the concept with equation and the figure.\n3. How to balance the different weights in Equation 5 of different branches? Are there some ablations or just equally distributed?"
