                "value": "This paper considers a variant of the online knapsack problem in which items arrive online, and the algorithm does not know the weight and value of the item before it arrives. Upon each arrival, the algorithm must make an irrevocable decision to either accept or reject the item. The goal is to accept a set of items such that (1) the total weight of the accepted item does not exceed the capacity of the knapsack; (2) the total value of the accepted items is maximized. By observing that the algorithm for the online knapsack problem may not be fair for each item, the authors include a fairness constraint to the problem, which leads to a new variant of the problem.\nThe main contribution is a fairness notation, and they show that such a fairness notation is too strong to admit a bounded competitive algorithm. They then relax the constraint and propose a deterministic algorithm that is Pareto optimal on fairness and efficiency. In addition, the authors also consider the learning-augmented algorithms. This work also includes some numerical experiments."

Although the basic idea of the algorithm comes from the classical threshold algorithm of OKP, the proposed algorithm contains sufficient new ideas and analysis.\n3.The results included in the paper are rich. The authors provide a lower bound for the studied problem. In addition, the authors show that randomness can further improve the ratio.

I have taken a quick look at the proof of Theorem 4.3, and I also understand that such a definition plays an important role in the analysis. But the practical meaning of such a relaxation is not clear. For example, when \\alpha=0 or epsilon, what does \\alpha-CTIF stand for? This part is important since the main purpose of the work is to make the OKP\u2019s algorithm fair. Thus, finding a suitable fairness notion is critical.\n2.It seems that the authors try to claim that fairness is important in the online knapsack problem by Example 1.1. But Example 1.1 is just a typical example of the online knapsack problem, and it does not reflect the importance of fairness. One may need to find another example to convince people about the importance of fairness."

In particular, the authors are interested in competitive algorithms that don\u2019t discriminate items based on when they appear in the sequence of observed items. First, they formalize the notion of time fairness. Second, they observe that previous OKP algorithms with good competitive ratios are not time-fair. Third, they show that randomization can be used to reach Pareto-optimal trade-off between fairness and competitiveness. Pareto optimality here, means that neither measure can be increased without decreasing the other. Fourth, they run empirical experiments, which show poor performance of the randomized algorithm. The authors liken this to the results of Reineke in 2014, where similarly poor empirical performance was observed on theoretically strong randomized algorithms for caching.  Fifth, they show that learning-augmented algorithms can be used to improve both fairness and competitiveness. Finally, they show the superior experimental performance of the learning-augmented algorithms."
