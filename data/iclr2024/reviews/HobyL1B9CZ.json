                "value": "This paper proposes chain of experts (CoE), a framework that uses multiple LLM agents to solve operations research (OR) problems. Most complex OR problem requires coordination among multiple experts, each solving a subproblem. In CoE, these experts are implemented using specialized LLMs augmented with, e.g., knowledge bases or reasoning skills targeting the subproblems they are designed to solve. A separate conductor model orchestrated this coordination process. This framework is further augmented by a backward reflection process, that, conditioning on the feedback provided by the program execution environment, recursively runs backward to identify potential errors in the chain. CoE does not require updating the parameters of the LLM agents, and thus is applicable to both proprietary and open-source models.\n\nCoE is evaluated on LPWP (elementary linear programming problems), and complexOR (a newly created dataset by the paper, containing 20 expert-annodated OR problems). Experiments with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-2 suggest that CoE outperforms baselines. An ablation analysis quantifies the contribution of each design choice in CoE."
