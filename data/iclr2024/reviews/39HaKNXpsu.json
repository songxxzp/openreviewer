The proposed Flash-Diffusion method appears to be a straightforward blend of the severity encoding method and certain existing techniques/tricks that have been previously proposed in prior works, such as the technique proposed by Chung et al. (2022c) that starts the reverse diffusion process from a good initial reconstruction instead of pure noise.\n\n2. The severity encoding method seems to be a minor trick. It is based on a restrictive and impractical assumption that the prediction error in latent space can be modeled as zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian, despite the authors making some efforts to mitigate this assumption through noise correction.. While the presented experimental results may provide some insight into the potential effectiveness of this technique, I believe that they are insufficient to prove the viability of it.\n\n3. The authors highlight in the abstract that \"our technique achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based techniques, with significant improvements in computational efficiency\". But they only provide a very short paragraph before **Conclusions** to illustrate the efficiency of the method, and there is a clear lack of comprehensive comparisons or benchmarking against other techniques, particularly in terms of computational efficiency. Additionally, Figure 6, which is meant to illustrate the efficiency of the method, is confusingly labeled with an x-axis for \"NFE\" and a legend for \"fixed steps\", making it difficult to interpret. Furthermore, while the authors mainly try to achieve significant improvements in computational efficiency, they still stick to DDPM and use more than 100 NFEs. In terms of sampling efficiency, DDPM is rather weak and outdated. The authors should at least try to combine their method with DDIM and DPM-Solver, or other more advanced fast sampling methods for diffusion models (which only require less than 20 NFEs to obtain reasonable generation/reconstruction).\n\n4. As far as I can tell, the authors only present experimental results for the deblurring task, but mention in the abstract that \"We perform numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear **inverse problems**\". For \"inverse problems\", I would expect to see the results for various types of inverse problems, instead of only for deblurring. Please be more precise."
