For watermarking, it points out that diffusion purification can effectively remove low-perturbation budget watermarks but fails to work on high-perturbation budget ones. For the latter one, the paper proposes using a model-substitution adversarial attack to remove the watermarks. It also proposes a spoofing attack against watermarking by blending a watermarked noise image with the non-watermarked target image. Finally, it demonstrates a trade-off between the robustness and reliability of classification-based deepfake detectors."

It is common sense pointed out by several previous research that the stronger the perturbations, the more difficult for purification. Using random noise or adversarial perturbations to compromise the machine-learning-based forensics models (watermarking and deepfake detection) has been studied in the past, which is also mentioned in the related work section.\n \nThe experiment settings are insufficient to demonstrate the claimed problems. Besides DiffPure (Nie et al., 2022), there are other diffusion-based approaches, such as DDNM (Wang et al., 2022), and non-diffusion-based ones, which are not investigated.\n \nThe robustness of the proposed attack methods, which is an important property, was not evaluated. DiffPure (Nie et al., 2022), JPEG compression, or Gaussian blur can be used to mitigate such attacks, although it may slightly degrade the clean accuracy.\n\nThe paper should include a paragraph of ethics statement."
