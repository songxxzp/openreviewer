Correct me if I am wrong, to my understanding, the proposed framework can be applied any pretrained model with good semantics like DINOv2[2], CLIP[3] and ect. Those framework has been proved to have very good features. What would be the results to distillate from those pretrained models for image matching and visual localization.\n3. One minor question of the use of SAM. SAM can segment different levels of object due to ambiguity. For example, a person can be defined as an object or the cloth of this person can be defined as an object. When applying semantic grouping, how to define such grid propmt for SAM?\n4. Can we directly use SAM feature for such image matching and visual localization task?\n5. For the first line of table 3, how is it different with MTLDesc?\n\n[1] Y,Liu, et al.

However, acquiring structured information through SAM (PSRD), and using semantic grouping to construct positive and negative samples, thereby introducing contrastive learning, have already been briefly discussed in previous works (SFD2, TPR). From this, the paper is more like an integration of some schemes combined with the SAM  model. Hence, its technical novelty is somewhat weak from my perspective.\n\n(2) In practical applications, is it really necessary to adopt all the components described in the paper? The actual contributions of different losses to model optimization still need further verification. For example, in Table 3, how about the performance without using EAG? In addition, are WCS and EAG really irreplaceable by each other? For instance, could eliminating WCS and adjusting the weight of EAG not affect the final results? This raises concerns about the actual importance of WCS ( the semantic embedding ) in the current framework.\n\n(3) Again, regarding Table 4 in the Appendix, the performance seems quite sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters. Would adjusting the loss weight of EAG also further affect the choice of these hyperparameters? After all, as mentioned in the main article, the features enhanced by EAG are further used for subsequent WCS calculations.\n\n(4) Some technical implementation details are still unclear. For example, for Local Feature Detection, is the enhanced C3 computed first before proceeding to calculate C4? The structural diagram in Figure 2 and the description in the subsection on Local Feature Detection have caused confusion regarding more specific technical details. I hope the authors can polish this part."

I would highly suggest the authors have a deeper study on the proposed techniques on how they are contributing the final performance.\n\n2. It is not clear how much overhead for the training after adding the extra loss functions. For example, if I understand correctly, the relationship distillation seems to be very computational heavy in that the affinity matrix contains quadratic number of entries to the image size. Likewise, the second loss term need to compute the with-group and cross-group similarities for all image regions. Overall, I am afraid that the proposed method is very time consuming during training. \n\n3. The experiments in the paper is not satisfactory. There is not much detailed and deep analysis on the proposed method as I mentioned earlier. Given the two tables Table 1 and 2, it is hard to tell whether the proposed method is fairly compared with previous works. For example, the authors mentioned that they used MTLDesc as the baseline method. In Table 1, the reported MMA@3 is 78.7 for it. However, when it goes to Table 3, the first row shows 75.7 MMA@3. This makes me a bit confused and doubted whether the authors are conducting solid and fair comparisons across the board. More importantly, it is also not clear about the main difference between the proposed method and others, regarding the learning techniques, vision encoder, training regimes, etc. \n\n4. Following the last point, the incorporation of SAM for local feature learning is interesting and valuable. However, it is not clear how the settings for the distillation affect the final performance. For example, the density of grid in SAM for automatical segmentation, the image resolutions, the number of sampling points for the proposed training losses, etc, all of them are not studied, which make the contribution of the work and effectiveness of the proposed method hard to assess."
