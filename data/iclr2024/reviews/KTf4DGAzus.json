While the paper has shown the existence of model selection problem, I am not aware of how important this problem is. There can be lots of problems in multi-modal reasoning, but some may not be of much value. Specifically, is there a huge gap between an oracle model selection and a random selection? Is there a na\u00efve solution that can approach the oracle performance? The authors are suggested to add these preliminary experiments to illustrate the significance of the problem.\n\n2. Lack of ablation study on model inputs. The paper claims that other model selection methods do not take subtask dependency into account. However, the ablation study does not show the effect of using subtask dependency as input. More broadly, because the framework uses various inputs, including multi-modal inputs, node embedding, subtask dependency, a more extensive ablation can be done by removing each component successively. This will show the importance of each component."

I find some of the notations are used without introducing first, which hinders a smooth reading. \nEspecially in Section 3.2:\n* Page 4, bottom line, $\\phi \\circ \\psi$ is used but they have not been introduced.\n* Page 5, Section 3.2.1, Para 1, $\\psi := [\\psi_1, \\psi_2]$ is used without explanation.\n\n2. Why choose SER as the metric rather than accuracy? From Figure 1, I thought a wrong model selection will mainly cause the system to give false answer. But the main metric adopted is to measure the successful execution rate. I think there is a difference between successful execution and final accuracy.\n\n3. What is the difficulty level in tab2? How do the authors define the difficulty level?"

                "value": "This paper addresses the importance of model selection in multi-modal agents, where Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in orchestrating various tools for collaborative multi-step task solving. Unlike traditional methods that use predefined models for subtasks, these multi-modal agents excel by integrating diverse AI models for complex challenges. However, existing multi-modal agents tend to overlook the significance of dynamic model selection, focusing primarily on planning and execution phases, which can make the execution process fragile.\n\nThe paper introduces the M3 framework as a plug-in with a small runtime overhead at test time. This framework aims to enhance model selection and improve the robustness of multi-modal agents in multi-step reasoning scenarios. In the absence of suitable benchmarks, the authors create a new dataset called MS-GQA, designed to investigate the model selection challenge in multi-modal agents. The experiments demonstrate that the M3 framework enables dynamic model selection by considering both user inputs and subtask dependencies, ultimately enhancing the overall reasoning process. The authors plan to make their code and benchmark publicly available."

It remains to be seen whether it is important for the entire task and how it can benefit real-world applications. The selection method proposed in this paper involves complex proxy training and may need to be more universally applicable or scalable for different reasoning tasks.\n\n2. Lack of reproducibility: The paper must include crucial details, such as the LLM used. The constructed MS-GQA dataset is not yet open-sourced, and the paper fails to provide even a single example of the dataset. Furthermore, the paper does not demonstrate how the proposed methods can improve various reasoning tasks and whether they can be applied to open-source models like LLaMA.\n\n3. The implementation of the baselines is weak: The original HuggingGPT paper dynamically selected models for tasks through in-context task-model assignment, yet this paper describes it as only using \"external metrics\" and implements it as \"choosing the most recently published one for each subtask\", which is misleading and causes unfair comparisons.\n\n4. The experiments could be more convincing: This paper only reports results on a newly created MS-GQA dataset. Even though it's compared to simple baselines that do not require training, like directly using the latest or best models (as shown in Table 2), the proposed M^3 method does not show consistent improvements and may even significantly degrade performance. It would be more convincing if experiments were conducted on more reasoning tasks, as done in VisProg and HuggingGPT."
