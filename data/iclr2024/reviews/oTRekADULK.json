                "value": "This work proposes SparseDiff, a diffusion-based deep method for graph generation. SparseDiff uses a message-passing graph transformer and random sampling of node pairs to compute its loss function, which allows it to exploit sparsity during the training phase. During sampling, the network repeatedly makes predictions on different subsets of node pairs until all possible edges are covered. Experiments on both small (molecular) datasets and large datasets (up to 500 node community graphs) indicate that the quality of graphs generated by SparseDiff is competitive with prior methods in both regimes."

Also, as the authors note, the proposed method's sampling complexity scales quadratically in the number of nodes, so it does not scale to very large graphs. However, as they also note, this may be necessary without assumptions about the data distribution.\n\nTypos\n- page 4: quotation marks around \"no edge\"\n- page 4: \"markovian\" uncapitalized\n- page 9: \"SparseDiff comparable\""

One vague question this raised for me is why it is then possible to exploit sparsity only during the training phase. Is the network during training not being trained to predict \"non-edge\" for the appropriate node pairs? Does this also constitute a distribution shift?\n- To clarify what exactly the method is, I would recommend breaking out the training and sampling procedures into algorithms outside the text. There seems to be an algorithm given for the sampling procedure in the appendix, which could maybe be moved to the main paper with the space saved from fixing the margins. Ideally that algorithm could be written in a more self-contained way"

However, there is also no guarantee for SparseDiff that the uniform sampling method can learn to reverse the diffusion process. I suggest the author show that there is a proper lower bound of the model when using such reverse distribution.\n\n(3) While SparseDiff advocates sparsity and efficiency, there is no time analysis. I suggest the author should include such discussion theoretically and empirically.\n\n(4) Some baselines are used in some datasets but not in others, can the authors explain why? Some results are not bolded correctly, for example, RBF MMD of SparseDiff in Ego is not significantly better than EDGE. For the table in D.6, DiGress has better RBFMMD than sparseDiff in the protein dataset and EDGE has better FID than sparseDiff in the Ego dataset, however, SparseDiff is bold for both cases.\n\n(5) A larger dataset should be taken into consideration as the author claims scalability in the paper.
