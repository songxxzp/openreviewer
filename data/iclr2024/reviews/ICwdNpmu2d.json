                "value": "* The paper lacks a clear structure, making it difficult to identify sections dedicated to previous work, the proposed method, and experiment settings. This ambiguity necessitates extra effort from the readers to discern these distinctions.\n* The literature review appears insufficient. The absence of a dedicated \"related work\" section and the lack of references from the domain are evident. The authors can consider papers [A systematic review of fundamental and technical analysis of stock market predictions] and [Neural network techniques for financial performance prediction: integrating fundamental and technical analysis] to make better literature review.\n* There is ambiguity surrounding the proposed method. It remains unclear what exact approach the authors have proposed.\n* The use of ChatGPT services, presumably leveraging LLMs, is revealed only at the end. This critical information should be upfront, as the experiments' outcomes heavily rely on ChatGPT and not even  involving training LLM themselves.\n* It's unclear which dataset was employed, its preprocessing steps, and the data splits used.\nIn Section 3, the link between the established conclusion (regarding the most effective consecutive combination of time periods) and the underlying motivation to use LLM remains ambiguous.\n* The method of computing accuracy in Section 4 is not explained. Given the mentioned accuracy range 0.7-0.72, the efficacy of the proposed approach seems questionable. The marginal improvement in accuracy using LLM raises questions about its necessity for this task. (From 0.72 to 0.73). Section 4 also aims to delve into causal relationships, but it lacks clarity. The results also seem misaligned with the stated objective.\n* Figure 1 lacks a clear y-axis label and accompanying caption to interpret its contents. The relevance and contribution of Figures 2 and 3 are unclear, as they do not appear to offer useful insights. Some expressions, such as \"We were pleased with the accuracy,\" are unorthodox for academic literature.\n* Section 5, discussing the Volatility Index (VIX), does not evidently connect with the paper's primary methodology or objectives. The experiments do not provide clear evidence supporting the advantages of using LLM for the stated task.\n* The paper lacks baseline comparisons to evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness compared other established methods.\n* The paper's contributions is unclear and remain questionable. The alignment between the experiments and the paper's motivation is not evident."
