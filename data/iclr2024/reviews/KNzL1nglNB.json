On the other, I believe that if you assume this, then there is no need for one-hot encodings, e.g., if you use squared error, and map each category to a distinct point in R^m, then optimizing the loss to zero requires the features to collapse for each category.\n\n---\n\n>  Since these label encodings serve as accurate supervision information\n\nThis doesn't seem to be true, at least not without additional qualifiers. From the appendix:\n\n> Furthermore, we observe that $w_c^u$ and $s^u_c$ in Eq. (7) may be incorrect at the beginning of the training iteration. \n> To prevent them from fitting into certain categories too early leading to unstable learning, we perform an additional softmax\n> transformation before calculating cross-entropy loss, which encourages them smoother. \n> The same strategy is also adopted in the following two tasks.\n\n---\n\nIn the intro,\n> One problem of EntMin is that the soft-labels assigned by the classifier could be mainly from dominant\n> categories with large numbers of samples, resulting in a decrease in prediction diversity (Cui et al., 2020) that the samples are prone to be\n> pushed towards the majority categories. One reason for that\n> lies in the absence of more appropriate guidance information for unlabeled samples. So we want to\n> ask \u201cfor unlabeled samples, is there more precise guidance information available?\u201d\n\nTo me, this insinuates that the paper would look at imbalanced settings, as these seem to motivate this work here. In fact, though, this is deferred to future work:\n\n> As a future direction, we intend to investigate the relationship between the LRM and ERM, in the context of\n> class-imbalanced supervised learning.\n\n---\n\nTheorem 1:\n> In addition, Theorem 1 is loss-agnostic and solely relies on the mapping property of f (\u00b7)\n\nIt is *not* loss agnostic. In fact, the theorem itself states that it assumes L(x,y) =  0 => x = y, which is not true, e.g., for max-margin losses.\n\n> The linear classifier is an injective function, which thus satisfies Theorem 1.\n\nA linear classifier need not be injective. In fact, if C < d, it *cannot* be injective.\nRegarding softmax, if you use `f` as the softmax function, and `L` as cross-entropy, then I would no longer call `h` the \"features\" -- these are now the logits. And I don't think applying L2 normalization or ReLU nonlinearities to the logits is a common practice.\n\n---\n\nsec. 4.2\n> These label encodings serve as reliable supervised information for learning from labeled samples.\n> Moreover, note that the label encodings remain consistent for both labeled and unlabeled samples\n> under label insufficient scenarios studied in this paper. Consequently, it is reasonable to apply\n> label encodings to guide the learning process of unlabeled samples. \n\nthat is an unsubstantiated claim (at this point in the paper at least)\n\n> Specifically, we first calculate the weighted average of prediction probabilities for unlabeled samples in each category, i.e., prediction mean.\n\nThe way this is written is wrong, though the actual calculations presented in the paper seem to be sensible. You cannot average predictions for unlabeled samples *of a category*, precisely because the categories are unknown. So the averaging is actually over the predicted distribution of categories as provided by some classifier.\n\n### Theorem 3:\nTheorem 3 seems to be the wrong way around, in the sense that normally, you'd like the original loss/risk to be upper-bounded by your proposed surrogate, so that optimizing the latter gives some guarantees on the former.\n\nOn a positive note, though, Fig. 2 shows that in practice, the two values can be quite close, so this might be more a theoretical concern.\n\n### Readability:\nThe paper would benefit from grammar improvements. Mostly, these do not impact readability too much. Below are two examples where I don't think the overall sentence structure works.  \n\n\npage  2:\n> As the ERM heavily relies on the guidance of the label information and fails to fully utilize the potential of unlabeled\nsamples, leading to suboptimal performance in label insufficient scenarios.\n\npage 9: \n> Accordingly, under the setting where only labeled samples from both domains are\n> available for training, which can be regarded as a class-balanced supervised learning task."
