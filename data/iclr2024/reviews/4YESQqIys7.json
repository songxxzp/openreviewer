The authors did not clearly present the architecture of NfgTransformer - I could not validate the novelty in terms of model design.\n\n- The authors did not give any theoretical guarantee - whether the proposed method secure the desired permutation equivariance, whether the method can reach the desired Nash equilibrium, how fast would the algorithm converge, whether the generalisability of the proposed method (as a learning algorithm) is satisfiable, whether the proposed method has any theoretical advances, etc. Before answering this question, I was quite hesitant about the proposed algorithm.\n\n- I appreciate the empirical results.

                "value": "### First sentence\n\nI'm going to start off by discussing the first sentence of the introduction:\n\n> A number of celebrated results in artificial intelligence (AI) have appealed to game-theoretic principles during training, evaluation and ranking (Silver et al., 2016; Lanctot et al., 2017; Vinyals et al., 2019; Omidshafiei et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022b; Perolat et al., 2022).\n\nThe way this sentence is written leaves the reader with the impression that the citations are examples of celebrated results that have appealed to game-theoretic principles. Let's go through them and examine whether this claim is true. I agree that Silver et al. (2016) is a celebrated result. However, it is not clear to me that it uses any game-theoretic principles during training (it uses supervised learning + self-play) or evaluation/ranking (it uses elo rankings). Lanctot et al. (2017) is not a result at all -- it is a paper that advocates for combining double oracle and deep RL. Vinyals et al. (2019), Omidshafiei et al. (2019), Liu et al. (2022b), Perolat et al. (2022) all use some level of game-theoretic justification, but none live up to the very high standard implied by the term \"celebrated\". One also cannot help but notice that all six of the cited papers are DeepMind papers. While it is certainly the case that DeepMind has made important contributions to RL in games (and perhaps more so than any other group), citing only DeepMind papers here is completely unjustifiable. Arguably, the two most significant sets of successes that directly appeal to game-theoretic principles are those concerning poker (DeepStack/Libratus/Pluribus/ReBeL) and No-Press Diplomacy (Diplodocus). That the submission choses to cite DeepMind papers as opposed to more-relevant non-DeepMind papers to support their claim gives the impression that it is attempting to push a narrative rather than give an honest perspective (or, alternatively, that the submission is simply uninformed). One might argue here that I am being too pedantic about a somewhat boilerplate sentence in the introduction that is not closely related to the submission's contributions. But I think it is important that the submission not mislead the reader.\n\n---\n\n### Motivation of paper\n\nAfter reading the introduction, I am not quite sure I fully grasp the problem that the submission is trying to solve. The submission abstractly states \"We consider the problem of bringing game-theoretic reasoning to deep learning systems and, conversely, using deep learning techniques to solve challenges in game theory\" but does not immediately clarify why would would want bring game-theoretic reasoning to deep learning systems or what challenges the submission is going to solve in game theory. It further states \"In its most basic form, strategic interactions between players are formulated as NFGs where players simultaneously select actions and receive payoffs subject to the joint action. Strategic interactions are therefore presented as payoff tensors, where values to each player are tabulated under every joint action. This tabular view of strategic interactions presents its own challenges to representation learning.\" Under the presumption that doing representation learning on a normal form game is important, I agree there are some representation learning-related challenges, but the submission hasn't really explained why we would want to be doing this in the first place. The submission then lists some game-theory related questions \"Examples of such enquiries permeate different communities within game theory: given sets of actions, what would be\nan equilibrium strategy (Greenwald et al., 2003; Marris et al., 2022; Duan et al., 2023a;b)? How does the efficiency of the system degrade due to individual selfishness (Koutsoupias & Papadimitriou,1999)? How might we cluster actions considering transitivity and strategy cycles (Czarnecki et al., 2020)? Given outcomes for some joint actions, can one predict payoffs for the others (Balduzzi et al., 2018; Bertrand et al., 2023; Vadori & Savani, 2023)? To what extent can we reduce the dimensionality of a class of NFGs (Marris et al., 2023)?\" This gives the reader the impression that these are some of the questions the submission is interested in. But the big question of *Why we need to learn a representation of the game to do this* remains unaddressed -- it is unclear to the why problems such as \"what would be an equilibrium strategy\" ought not to be addressed from a normal-form representation. The submission proceeds to list desiderata for a unified representation for solving these tasks.\n\n---\n\n### Description of methodology\n\nThe submission refers the reader to Figure 1 to understand the architecture that they're proposing, but I find the figure not very easy to grok. What does it mean when two arrows point at the same block?\n\nThe submission describes the architecture in Section 4, but I could not figure out what the architecture was being trained to do. I also still do not understand what the downstream use case of this architecture is.\n\n---\n\n### Experiments\n\nIn Section 5.1.1, the submission says this \"For equilibrium solving, we optimise variants of the NfgTransformer to minimise the NE GAP\n() = maxp p() directly.\" How is the submission performing this optimization? How are we recovering a NE strategy from the action embeddings? These questions are central to the paper, but seem to be unanswered in the text. Furthermore, why should we want to solve NFGs with this architecture instead of using a classical method? Without discussing this question, the reader is left wondering why they should care about these experiments.\n\nIn Section 5.1.2, the submission says this \"We optimise a NfgTransformer network to regress towards the maximum deviation-gain () for every joint pure-strategy (deterministic) , using a per joint-action decoder architecture (Figure 2).\" Again, it is totally not obvious how the submission is doing this based on the text in the paper. Furthermore, the submission again has no discussion about why we should want to use an architecture instead of a classical method for this task (which in this case just amounts to matrix multiplications).\n\nSection 5.2 studies a kind of payoff table completion task. Here it seems reasonable that one might actually want to use an architecture of the kind the submission describes. However, the submission still neglects to disclose how the the architecture was trained."
