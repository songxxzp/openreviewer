Traditional SSM creation methods have limitations, such as the need for noise-free meshes, reliance on assumptions, and long inference times. Point2SSM addresses these issues by inferring SSMs from raw point clouds, a process that is more efficient and widely applicable due to the ease of acquiring point cloud data. Despite recent advances in deep learning for 3D point clouds, the construction of SSMs for anatomy faces challenges such as noisy or incomplete input and limited training data. Point2SSM overcomes these by using an attention-based module for correspondence mappings, demonstrating superior performance in surface sampling and correspondence, thus enhancing the capture of population-level anatomical statistics."

The CPs must accuractely summarize a shape and correspond to consistent anatomical features such that they can be used, e.g., with PCA, to compute population level statistics.\n\nPoint2SSM maps $N$ input points to $M$ CPs. It consists of a dynamic graph CNN (DGCNN) encoder which outputs a feature vector for each input point. Then, self-feature augment (SFA) attention is applied on the feature vectors. Softmax is then applied to produce an $M x N$ attention matrix that maps the input points to the CPs. Point2SSM is trained in an unsupervised fashion. A Chamfer loss is used to ensure the CPs accurately summarizes the input shape and an adapted pairwise mapping error (ME) is used to ensure the CPs correspond to consistent features. While each components of Point2SSM does not seem novel, their combination is.\n\nThe authors compare Point2SSM with several recent and relevant methods on three datasets of spleens, pancreases, and left atriums. They show that Point2SSM summarizes shapes significantly better than the compared methods, while being competitive regarding the consistency of the CPs. They perform additonal experiments showing improved robustsness and include ablation experiments in the supplementary that shows the benefit of each component."

This is not an issue for me, but: if true, I think the inspiration/similarities should be mentioned and Chen et al., 2020 cited in sec. 3.1. If false, I would like the authors to clarify the differences.\n- It is stated that enforcing the CPs to be a convex combination of the input points \"increases surface sampling accuracy\". It is not fully clear to me why this must be true. From the attention maps in App. B, Fig. 7, right, CPs could be placed very inacurately even if they are convex combinations of the attended points. I would like clarification on this point. If it is an empircal observation, I would like it clearly stated (ideally, with an ablation experiment but this is not crucial to me).\n- It is not clear to me why Point2SSM has such a benefit when it comes to adding new samples. How would this work? Would one \"simply\" continue training from previous weights, or does the architecture enable something smarter?\n- Minor point: At the end of sec. 2.3, it is stated that: \"These methods establish correspondence but are prone to overfitting given a limited training budget and are not robust to noise, missingness, and sparsity in the input point cloud.\" I find this to be a strong statement.

Would \"upscaling\" the other models narrow the performance gap? I would like the authors to clarify why/why not.\n- Top of page 5: please specify what \"Euclidean neighbors\" mean. As I can tell, it is the K-nearest neighbors - if so I suggest using that. While Lang et al., 2021 also used \"Euclidean neighborhood\", I think  it would make the text in this paper easier to read with another term.\n- The text in the figures is very small. Also, blue text on blue background in Fig. 5 is hard to read. Improving this would make the results much easier to interpret.\n- For the robustness experiments, it would be nice to illustrate how the pertubations look like. This can just be in the supplementary.\n- For the sparse input experiment, how are the points sampled? Random, farthest point samping or other?\n- When illustrating modes of variation, I find it more clear to deform the mean shape instead of showing deformation vectors. However, this is minor for me and the authors may choose to change it or not.\n- Section 3.1, first line: second use of \"unordered\" seems redundant."
