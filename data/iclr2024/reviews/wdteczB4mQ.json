                "value": "This paper studies the problem of generative model-learned algorithm for Grobner bases. Grobner bases are ubiquitous object for solving polynomial systems, but currently most known libraries that compute Grobner bases do require doubly exponential runtime in the worst case. It is therefore crucial to use tools such as transformers to facilitate this task. This paradigm also poses new interesting problems for Grobner bases: given a Grobner basis, how can one generate a polynomial set that is not a Grobner basis but spanned by the given basis (they call this problem backward Grobner problem)? Moreover, how can one randomly sample a Grobner basis? This paper shows how to solve these problems whenever the polynomials are in shape position and thus for zero-dimensional radical ideals. For the backward Grobner problem, they show a suitable linear mapping can indeed generate a non-Grobner basis while preserving the target set. Their characterization of such linear mapping is rather general, and they show how to sample a subset of these maps via Bruhat decomposition. Finally, experiments are performed, and the accuracy are relatively good. Interestingly, their experiments show that transformers perform much better for lexicographical order instead of graded reverse lexicographical, which is the most popular ordering to my knowledge."

Many algorithms for solving polynomial systems and related do require Grobner basis. However, Grobner basis algorithm is notably inefficient, so studying machine learning-based approaches is crucial. \n\nThe study of transformer-based approach also elucidates new problems for Grobner bases, such as how to sample them, and how to generate a non-Grobner basis given a Grobner basis. These are novel and intriguing problems and might have further applications. This paper attempts to address the first problem by sampling over zero-dimensional radical ideals, so that most polynomials are in shape position that are easy to handle. It is worth noting that zero-dimensional ideals is a vast and popular family in which many applications lie in. For the backward Grobner problem, they provide a characterization of linear maps that do enable the transformation from Grobner basis to non-basis.\n\nOverall, I think the problems imposed in this paper are interesting, and the theoretical results while not super surprising, are solid."

In particular, for the popular grevlex order, the transformer-based approach is very bad. It is surprising that the support accuracy is much higher than the actual accuracy for basis generation. One can argue that the blackbox nature of transformers makes it very hard to interpret the bottleneck of this method, but I do hope other architectures are tried to obtain a better empirical result. This is essential, as the main selling point of this paper is to use machine learning blackbox method to compute Grobner bases more efficiently.\n\nEven though the main motivation of this paper is to use transformers, the theoretical parts and the two problems regarding Grobner bases are intriguing to me than the experiments."

This paper investigates the use of transformers in speeding up the solving.\n\nTraining a transformer requires a large set of input output pairs from a distribution resembling the distribution of interest,  and this set is not available for the grobner basis problem, due to the computational complexity of generation. To solve this issue, the authors propose a novel method to uniformly sample from the output domain, i.e. set of grobner bases and then find a corresponding input in polytime. The authors then train a transformer on this set and demonstrate the efficacy of their approach.
