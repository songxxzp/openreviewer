The proposed approach addresses the limitation of existing perception tasks by providing a unified occupancy representation for comprehensive 3D scene understanding. PanoOcc utilizes voxel queries to aggregate spatiotemporal information from multi-frame and multi-view images, integrating feature learning and scene representation. The method achieves state-of-the-art results for camera-based semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation on the nuScenes dataset, and demonstrates promising performance on the Occ3D benchmark."

It lacks innovation in terms of addressing the specific challenges and design considerations for occupancy tasks. \n2. Limited generalization: The experiments are solely conducted on the nuScenes dataset, which may limit the generalizability of the proposed method to other autonomous driving scenarios or datasets. More extensive evaluation on diverse datasets is necessary to demonstrate the method's ability to generalize. \n3. Limited performance improvement: Despite achieving state-of-the-art results, the paper reports only modest improvements in terms of mIoU. The performance on irregular objects is particularly lacking, which contradicts the initial intention of addressing occupancy tasks for handling irregular shapes. \n4. Lack of in-depth analysis: The paper could benefit from providing more in-depth analysis and discussion on the limitations and potential failure cases of the proposed method. Further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the approach would enhance the understanding of its limitations and avenues for future improvements."
