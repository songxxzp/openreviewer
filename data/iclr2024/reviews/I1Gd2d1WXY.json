It uses Laplacian residual connections to adapt the resolution of models quickly, reducing computation as resolution decreases. ARRNs also incorporate Laplacian dropout to enhance the networks' robustness to low-resolution signals. This allows for training high-resolution ARRNs that can later be compressed into effective low-resolution ARRNs."

It would be better to discuss these papers.\n\n[1] Learning continuous image representation with local implicit image function.  \n[2]  Local texture estimator for implicit representation function.  \n[3] Implicit transformer network for screen content image continuous super-resolution.  \n[4] CiaoSR: Continuous Implicit Attention-in-Attention Network for Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution.  \n\n2. The authors highlight that it is impractical for the majority of deep learning methods to apply a single network at various signal resolutions. Could you provide some examples of such application scenarios in the paper?\n\n3. The experiments are not sufficient. The authors mainly conduct experiments on image classification on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. It is not convincing that the proposed method does not hinder performance or require re-training. The authors should conduct more experiments on ImageNet with more neural networks. In addition, can the ARRNs used in other tasks, e.g., super-resolution?\n\n4.
