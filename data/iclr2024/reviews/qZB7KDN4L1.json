Moreover, this paper designs the model architecture to take control signals such as bounding box, segmentation mask to supplement its model training for fidelity and faithfulness. Using this model, the paper claims that it can perform single subject image generation, multi-subject image generation, as well as human subject generation."

                "value": "- The paper is emphasizing that they have outperformed state-of-the-art in single subject generation, which is not supported by its results. Particularly, the comparison in Table 1 is intentionally ignoring the state-of-the-art results from SuTI (Chen et. al. 2023). I have found neither comparison nor discussion to justify this ignorance. Additionally, it would also be important to do qualitative side-by-side comparison with SuTI to understand the quality of generation. \n  - IMO, a great paper could be one without the state-of-the-art performance, but should not be one that claims to be state-of-the-art without comparing to the actual state-of-the-art method. \n- The reproducibility of the paper is questionable, given that the model training is relying on a large private dataset (at least the labels, masks, and grounding). While the dataset is being argued as one of this paper's main contribution, there is no discussion on quality of the data (not a lot examples in main paper or appendix), no discussion on how bias/privacy is protected, no plan or discussion on releasing the data. \n- The image resolution provided in the paper is quite small (even counting the ones in the supplementary). Having high-resolution image generation is quite important to assess the quality of model in the field of image generation. Looking at figure 6 (when zooming in ), I could find a lot of artifacts in the interpolated results, the face is losing details, the cat face is weird, the lion looks more like a horse to me. Similarly, figure 5 also seems to have a lot of artifacts from my perspective."

However, there is no analysis on the distribution of data (in terms of ethic groups), no privacy filtering (e.g., anonymizing/mosaicing human face, or at least de-associate the name of the person with the face), etc. \n\nGiven that a big part of the contribution from this paper is the dataset, I believe such analysis and some degree of anonymization is required, and would like to ask the ethic reviewer to consider reviewing this particular paper."
