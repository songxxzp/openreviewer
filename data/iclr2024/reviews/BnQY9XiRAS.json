In other words, if the proposed Transformer network is applied to an ordinary graph (say a k-NN graph), does the SE(3) invariant and SO(3) equivariant properties still hold?\n\n1.2 It seems that the node-wise transformer layer in SE(3) invariant message passing (Section 4.1) has no significant difference from the conventional graph Transformer (or graph attention network) [1]. Though detailed design may be different, but the general structure/scheme are similar.

                "value": "The word \"problem\" appears only once (in the abstract), though a rigorous and explicit problem statement might have helped to understand the unresolved challenges. \n\nIf we need a complete and invariant description of a periodic crystal, crystallographers solved this problem nearly 100 years ago by using Niggli's reduced cell of a lattice and then recording all atoms in so-called standard settings, see the book \"TYPIX standardized data and crystal chemical characterization of inorganic structure types\" by Parth\u00e9 et al, which actually applies to all periodic crystals, not only inorganic. \n\nHowever, all these standardizations have become obsolete in the new world of big and noisy data because the underlying lattice (not even a unit cell) of any periodic crystal is discontinuous under almost any perturbation, which is obvious already in dimension 1.\n\nFor example, the set Z of all integers is nearly identical to a periodic sequence with points 0, 1+ep_1, ..., m+ep_m in the unit cell [0,m+1] for any sma;; ep_1,...,ep_m close to 0, though their minimal periods (or unit cells) 1 and m+1 are arbitrarily different. \n\nThis discontinuity was reported for experimental crystals already in 1965, see Lawton SL, Jacobson RA. The reduced cell and its crystallographic applications. Ames Lab., Iowa State Univ. of Science and Tech.\n\nA more recent example from Materials Project shows two nearly identical crystals whose unit cells differ by a factor of (approximately) 2\nhttps://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-568619\nhttps://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-568656\n\nMoreover, atoms in any material always vibrate above absolute zero temperature, so their positions continuously change. As a result, any crystal structure with fixed atomic coordinates in a database is only a single snapshot of a potentially dynamic object, especially for proteins whose structures are also determined often by crystallization. \n\nHence the new essential requirement for any (better than the past) representations of crystals is a proved continuity under perturbations of atoms. This problem has been solved by Widdowson et al (NeurIPS 2022) with theoretical guarantees and practical demonstrations on the world's largest collection of materials: the Cambridge Structural Database. The underlying invariants have a near-linear time in the motif size and were used for property predictions by Ropers et all (DAMDID 2022) and by Balasingham et al (arxiv:2212.11246). \n\nDespite the authors citing one of the papers above, Definition 1 didn't follow the definitions from the past that modeled a crystal as a periodic point set not as a graph. \n\nAny graph representation of a crystal or a molecule is discontinuous because all chemical bonds are only abstract representations of inter-atomic interactions and depend on numerous thresholds on distances and angles, while atomic nuclei are real physical objects.\n\nThe traditional representation in (1) and Definition 5 (appendix A.3) of an isometry order atoms in a unit cell. While many crystals contain identical atoms, the invariance under permutations of atoms is missed because the paper has no words \"permute\" or \"permutation\".\n\nThe permutation invariance seems lost when using angles, which depend on point ordering. \n\nThe property prediction makes sense only for really validated data, not for random values, because neural networks with millions of parameters can predict (overfit) any data."

Some duplicates were reported by Widdowson et al (MATCH 2022) as being investigated by several journals for data integrity. \n\nThe dataset details in section A.5 could include the most important information: whether crystals are simulated or experimental, and if the \"ground-truth\" properties are obtained from computer modeling or physical experiments. \n\nIt seems that all used crystals are hypothetical with simulated properties. Is the main contribution a computer program that predicts the outputs of other computer programs? \n\nIf initial property computations were too slow and most likely iterative, why not to stop their computations earlier instead of writing another program simulating the simulations?\n\nHow many hidden parameters and CPU hours were used for producing the experimental results?\n\nWhat results in the paper are stronger than the past work below?\n\n(1) continuity under perturbations in Theorem 4.2 and generic completeness of the density fingerprint in Theorem 5.1 from Edelsbrunner et al (SoCG 2021),  \n(2) continuity under perturbations in Theorem 4.3 and generic completeness with an explcit reconstruction in Theorem 4.4 from Widdowson et al (NeurIPS 2022),\n(3) full completeness in Theorem 10 from Anosova et al (DGMM 2021), extended in arxiv:2205.15298,  \n(4) 200+ billion pairwise comparisons of all periodic crystals in the Cambridge Structural Database completed within two days on a desktop, see the conclusions in Widdowson et al. \n\nDid the authors know about the classical results in crystallography cited above, starting from Niggli (1927), Lawton (1965), and Parthe (1987)?"
