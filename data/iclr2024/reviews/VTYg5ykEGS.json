                "value": "This work introduces a new OOD detection benchmark for ImageNet-1K, namely ImageNet-OOD (IN-OOD for short). Compared to existing benchmarks (e.g., Species, OpenImage-O, SSB, NINCO), IN-OOD minimizes covariate shifts and operates at a large scale (in terms of # OOD categories and # images). With this new benchmark, the authors evaluate several recent post-hoc detectors under both 1) novel class detection and 2) failure detection schemes. The major finding is that existing detectors are (undesirably) much more sensitive to covariate shifts than semantic shifts, and most detectors do not provide practical benefits over the simplest baseline MSP."

Although not for the first time, this work does focus on and point out several crucial issues for OOD detection research (which unfortunately still haven't been paid enough attention by the researchers in this field). These issues include: 1) the lack of a semantic shift-only, clean, and large-scale OOD dataset for ImageNet-1K, 2) the sensitivity of existing methods to covariate shift, and 3) the mismatch between a) the ultimate goal of OOD detection and b) the \"wrong\" goal reflected by the current evaluation which is the result of issue 1) and 2).\n2. The constructed IN-OOD would indeed be valuable, especially considering the rigorousness introduced by the several filtering processes and the final human inspection. I could imagine how big the human efforts involved in this process are, and I personally appreciate it.\n3. Performing evaluations under both new-class detection and failure detection setting is good, which can provide a unified assessment."

                "value": "1. An important reference, OpenOOD v1.5 [1] is missing (released on arXiv in June 2023). Their evaluation results in the full-spectrum OOD detection setting (considering semantic-shifted and covariate-shifted samples together [2]) are also concrete evidences that current OOD detection methods, not restricting to post-hoc methods, are very sensitive to covariate shifts. This is actually presented as one of their major observations, and thus I believe it is necessary to discuss this work at least in the Related Work section.\n\n2. Like I said, I appreciate the efforts in constructing IN-OOD and I recognize the value in this new dataset. However, I wouldn't say that the observation of \"OOD detectors are more sensitive to covariate shifts than semantic shifts\", which is one of the claimed contributions, is new. Evidences include both [1, 2]. Another major observation of this work, \"the practical benefits of these algorithms disappear under new-class detection\", is also similar to one presented in [1], where they find the improvements in \"near-OOD\" (which essentially has less covariate shifts than \"far-OOD\") detection is limited.\n\n3. This is not really a weakness. I like the example in Figure 1 where \"Animal, Vehicle\" are ID, and training images of \"Animal\" is dog while test images could be cat. This actually points to a type of covariate shift called Subpopulation Shift [3]. I think the discussion on this example could be made more clear by explicitly discussing the relationship between OOD detection and Subpopulation Shift (although I agree that this could often times be application-dependent).\n\n4. Lastly, again this is not technically a weakness, but part of me feels that this work might suit dedicated dataset & benchmark track better.\n\n[1] OpenOOD v1.5: Enhanced Benchmark for Out-of-Distribution Detection\n\n[2] Full-Spectrum Out-of-Distribution Detection\n\n[3] BREEDS: Benchmarks for Subpopulation Shift"

                "value": "As demonstrated by NINCO work, human inspection is necessary for constructing clean OOD datasets (which is also recognized in this work). However, human inspection could be extremely costly, which I believe is the reason why NINCO itself is limited in size (a few hundreds or at most thousands of images). IN-OOD in comparison has a total of 31,807 images. I was wondering how thorough and rigorous the human inspection was for the \"final review\" of IN-OOD at this size. How many human inspectors were involved and how long did it take for the final review?"

How do you choose this threshold, considering that the selection is manually performed. Regarding **Q4**, it would be useful to use such an automatic approach in order to establish a relevant threshold. \n\n**Q6** Regarding Sec. 4.2 - The considered covariate shifts are restricted to image alteration techniques (blur, noise, etc.). But, covariate shifts can also appear when we observe objects in city backgrounds in ID, while in the OOD set, we observe objects on a forest background. \n\n*Q6.1* Have you considered this type of covariate shifts? I assume that the conclusion of this section will not hold in this scenario. Actually, it may be valid for a restricted set of covariate shifts, strongly related with the inductive bias of the considered model architecture. \n\n*Q6.2* Have you performed the same analysis considering semantic shifts? This would be useful in order to conclude that random models are more sensitive to covariate shifts.  \n\n[2] Alvarez-Melis and Fusi \"Geometric dataset distances via optimal transport\" -NeurIPS 2020 \n[3] Radford et al.
