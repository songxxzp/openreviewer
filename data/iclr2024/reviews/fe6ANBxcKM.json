The communication cost shown in [1] not only logarithmically scales with T, but also is more efficient in terms of other factors (M: number of agents, $(1-\\gamma)^{-1} (\\approx H)$: length of horizon). I understand that direct comparison might be difficult given the settings are different, but I\u2019m still not convinced that the communication cost shown in this paper is especially low. It would be nice if you could provide more detailed comparisons with recent literature to help better understand on the communication efficiency.\n\n[1]: Jiin Woo, Gauri Joshi, and Yuejie Chi.

Is there any reason to introduce event-triggered synchronization especially in this setting?\n* The algorithm seems to fix the Q-values and behavior policies to be the same for all agents during local iterations. However, a setting that agents can flexibly change their policy based on their local observations before the next synchronization seems more natural to me, especially in the federated setting. Would it hurt the performance if they can change their policies and Q-estimates locally during local updates? I wonder if letting agents to change their policies can introduce some diversity in their exploration, which might be an advantage in learning."

In the model, there are $M$ agents that play in a given tabular episodic MDP and aim to minimize total regret. More formally, a tabular episodic MDP consists of $J$ episodes, where in each episode, the agents are given an adversarial picked initial state and everyone will keep picking actions till an absorbing state is reached. Each time an agent picks an action, it receives a reward that can help it update the strategy. An agent's regret for one episode is defined to be the difference between the rewards obtained by the optimal strategy and its strategy, and the goal is to minimize the sum of regrets for each agent in each episode. \n\nThe authors first propose a federated Q-Learning algorithm and show that with a communication cost of $O(M^2H^4S^2A\\log(T/M))$, the algorithm obtains a regret of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{H^4SAMT})$, where $H$ is the number of steps per episode, $T$ is the total number of steps, $S$ is the number of states in MDP, $A$ is the number of actions and $M$ is the number of agents. Further, using a higher upper confidence bound, the regret can be improved to $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{H^3SAMT})$ under the same communication cost."

The regret speedup is nearly linear, but not exactly linear, due to the overhead terms that are linear in $M$, the number of machines, that appears in both Thm 4.1 and 5.1. Immediately after Thm 4.1, the paper also states that the algorithm enjoys a linear speedup in terms of $M$ in the general FL setting, despite the presence of the overhead terms. \n2. While the typical martingale-style concentration analysis in the single agent RL setting cannot be directly applied, bounding each local term's \"drift\" from some \"averaged parameter update path\" is a commonly used technique in federated learning. \n3. Compared with contemporary or prior works on federated RL, the paper focuses on a more \"vanilla\" setting, where updates are allowed to be adversarial or asynchronous, the setting considered in this paper is a fairly simplified, bare bones version of federated RL.\n\nMinor Comments\n1. The term $\\beta$ in eq (3) and (4) should be (at least) indexed to reflect the fact that it changes over time. Preferably, it should also indicate that the term changes with $(x, a, h)$. Otherwise, as of now, it appears that a constant is added to the Q-function estimate at every single round and is misleading.\n2. It might be useful to rename paragraph \"New Weight Assignment Approach\" on page 7 to \"Equal Weight Assignment Approach\", or something similar. Currently, the phrase \"equal weight assignment\" is claimed to be a major contribution, but from the manuscript it is not immediately obvious what this procedure means mathematically.\n3. Please see the questions below on the tightness of the technical results.\n4. Due to the overall similarity between RL and bandits, some literature survey on federated/distributed bandit would be a welcomed addition to Appendix A."

Can the authors provide either some lower bound or some additional justification for the overhead terms? \n3. For theorem 4.1, why can we ignore the overhead terms that are on the order of $O(HSAM\\sqrt{H^3\\iota} + H^4SAM)$ in the general FL setting?"
