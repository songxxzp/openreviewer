Moreover, it is not clear why FFB or FairTorch cannot be extended to include more fairness definitions.\n \n2. I find \"fairness tools\" misleading. This is sometimes used to refer to fairness measures,  sometimes to their approximations as regularization terms and sometimes to their implementations.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n- I would recommend following the following guide while writing equations: \nhttp://www.ai.mit.edu/courses/6.899/papers/mermin.pdf"
