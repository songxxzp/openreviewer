The method allows for flexible management of inference costs at test time and can be applied to various datasets and model architectures. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets and show that it outperforms other distillation methods."

                "value": "While the idea of meta-learning for multi-teacher KD has potential, the claims require more empirical and analytical support. Broader experimentation, justification of design choices, and engagement with relevant studies would help validate the work's novelty and significance.\n\n1. Lack of novelty:\n\nWhile multi-teacher distillation is not a new idea, the paper claims to introduce a meta-learning approach to optimize the weights of different teachers. Direct comparisons to related work like AEKD (NeurIPS2020)  that uses optimization methods are missing. More discussion is needed to justify the claims of novelty. Also, meta-optimization is very difficult to implement and not very effective. Currently meta-optimized distillation is generally ineffective or difficult to reproduce\n\n2. Lack of thorough evaluation:\n\nThe evaluation on small datasets is insufficient. Following KD work norms, it should test on large-scale datasets like ImageNet and report downstream transfer learning results. The choice of teacher-student pairs could be better motivated by discussing alternatives like lightweight networks.  \n\n3. Lack of discussion on relevant studies:\n\nTo properly situate this work in the rapidly advancing KD literature, it needs to discuss closely related recent papers [1,2,3,4,5,6] like those pointed out. These address self-supervised KD, representation matching, offline-online transfer, architecture search for distillation, and automated KD - all highly pertinent topics the paper does not engage with. A more comprehensive literature review would strengthen the paper.\n\n[1] Self-Regulated Feature Learning via Teacher-free Feature Distillation.
