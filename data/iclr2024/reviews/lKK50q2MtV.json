First doing joint editing and then propagating the features makes sense. \n- From qualitative results, TokenFlow improves the temporal consistency and preserves fair fidelity. \n- Instead of using other pixelwise correspondences (e.g., dense flow or pixelwise trajectory), the authors propose to use nearest neighbor (NN) to find the correspondence.

Also in the third example \"cutting bread\", there is more flickering in the bread and background compared to Gen 1.

Specifically,  the comparison w/ PnP + propagation. The authors mention that they have an additional comparison with PnP-Diffusion + propagation in the **last sentence, Section 5 Baselines**, but this part seems missing either in the main paper or in the SM. \n- It would be great if the authors could also include runtime comparisons."

Can we apply downsampled optical flow maps to the feature maps? \n- Occlusion: Is the current framework be able to handle some extreme cases, like occlusion? For example, a dog running through some poles but sometimes the dog is occluded by pole. \n- Video length: What is the maximal length TokenFlow can handle? \n- What is the post-procssing deflickering that is used in the SM?"

The emphasis is on producing consistent frames as naively applying an image-based text-to-image diffusion model would generate individually good-quality frames, but when they are put together, it would jointly result in an inconsistent video. The key idea proposed in this paper to solve the problem is called TokenFlow, which enforces the edited internal representation of the diffusion process to preserve the inter-frame correspondences of the original video. The approach is simple and the results shown in the paper and the supplementary material look quite good."

It directly utilizes Stable Diffusion, DDIM inversion, and PnP-Diffusion, and the TokenFlow procedure just requires computing the nearest-neighbor fields for token feature maps. \nFurther, as mentioned in the summary in Sec. 1 of the paper, state-of-the-art editing results are one of the main contributions of this work. Indeed, the edited videos presented in the supplementary results exhibit better consistency than other methods' outputs.  \n\n2. \nA helpful finding from this work is that the internal features offer a shared and consistent representation across frames, and the corresponding features are interchangeable for the diffusion model. The spatial and semantic properties of diffusion features are also mentioned in the concurrent work \"Emergent Correspondence from Image Diffusion\" as DIFT, proposed by Tang et al.; however, they focus more on matching different images and show some results for edit propagation in image editing and for video label propagation on DAVIS and JHMDB instead of enforcing consistency in video editing. While it is not necessary to empirically compare TokenFlow with DIFT, it would be helpful to highlight the differences and the shared ideas.\nNevertheless, these findings of diffusion features provide a promising direction to revisit prior ideas like *Image Analogies* and *PatchMatch*."
