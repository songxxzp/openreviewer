It first points out that the implicit GNNs are suffering from the computational burden brought by (1) full-batch training and (2) a large number of iterations to solve fixed-point equations, limiting their applicability to large graphs. This work proposes a scalable and effective SEIGNN model that employs mini-batch training with coarse-level nodes to encourage information propagation between subgraphs. Extensive experiments are conducted to justify the power of SEIGNN in terms of both efficiency and efficacy."

In subgraph sampling, the coarse nodes are excluded from being the target nodes but will be included in the sampled subgraph through the top-k Personalized PageRank (PPR) selection step, is that correct?\n\n3. Given that the purpose of introducing the coarse nodes is to maintain long-term dependencies in mini-batch training, can SEIGNN ensure that coarse nodes are included in each mini-batch? Or is there a way to encourage the sampled subgraph to include more coarse nodes?\n\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07323\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10247"

Implicit GNNs are models that can capture long-range dependencies in graphs by solving a fixed-point equation. However, they are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, due to their use of full-batch training and a large number of iterations. SEIGNN addresses these limitations by using a mini-batch training method with coarse nodes and a stochastic solver. The coarse nodes are added to the mini-batch to incorporate global information from the graph, and the stochastic solver is used to obtain unbiased approximate solutions with fewer iterations. SEIGNN can be integrated with any existing implicit GNN model to improve its performance. The paper evaluates SEIGNN on six datasets and shows that it achieves better accuracy with less training time than existing implicit GNNs."

The idea of introducing coarse nodes during the process of mini-batching is relatively straightforward and appears in existing literature such as [3]. Therefore, it hurts the novelty of this work regarding the first contribution without a thorough comparison with the current mini-batching GNN methods that also include coarse nodes. Meanwhile, there is a very relevant and similar work that should be added for comparison [4].\n\n* For the second contribution of accelerated training with the Neumann solver, it is unclear how the authors constrain $n$ to be sufficiently large during experiments. In other words, does the performance of SEIGNN be affected even if the proposed stochastic solver is not an unbiased estimator? Could the authors elaborate more on this? \n\n* The setting of the experiments could be improved to better reflect the contributions. Do the results for all implicit GNNs come from full-batch training on all benchmarks? What would performance be if we incorporated different mini-batching sampling strategies for the baseline implicit GNNs? Meanwhile, more recent baselines of scalable GNN should be added for comparison such as [5-6].\n\n* This manuscript aims to scale implicit GNNs to large graphs, but the benchmarks have nearly become standard for even some GNNs that are not specifically designed for scalability. Therefore, large graphs such as ogbn-papers100M should be evaluated for the scalability aim.
