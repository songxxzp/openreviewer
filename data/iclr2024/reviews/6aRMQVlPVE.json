The proposed method drastically reduces training costs while achieving high performance, outperforming competing low-rank approaches. The paper also includes a discussion of the geometric integration theory of differential equations on tensor manifolds used in this work. Empirical evaluation on CIFAR10 using VGG and Alexnet models also shows the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Although the authors emphasize this extension is non-trivial as it requires the use of Tucker decomposition and additional techniques for theoretical analysis, I believe the extension is not significant enough to be considered as a novel contribution. \n\n2. The paper lacks discussion on computational complexity during training. The authors claim the proposed method drastically reduces the training cost but the empirical results on training cost are missing. In Figure 2, the authors only show the computational footprint of the inference stage. However, for such dynamical compression method I believe training cost is more important to discuss. It would be great to show a figure similar to Figure 2 in [1] to visualize the training cost across different rank values. In Table 1, it also would be great to present the total training cost by different methods for a fair comparison.\n\n3. More details of proposed method are needed. For example, what initialization on low-rank factors and does it affect the performance? How to choose the threshold?\n\n4. Evaluation on large-scale datasets and SOTA models are needed. CIFAR-10 is too small to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and VGG16 and Alexnet are outdated models. It would be great to evaluate methods on ImageNet at least using ResNet50.\n\n[1] Steffen Schotth\u00f6fer, Emanuele Zangrando, Jonas Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, and Francesco\nTudisco.

Would be great to provide more details on the training behavior of TDLRT, such as how rank evolves during training, convergence behaviors regarding various compression thresholds, etc.\n\n2. How often do you perform basis augmentation and tucker decomposition using SVD? If it is performed frequently for every step, does the numerical instability affects the convergence? such that, at the later stage of training, the perturbation on $C$ by learning algorithms may be too small compared to the numerical error induced by SVD.    \n\n3. Is there any way to further improve efficiency to make the method practical?"
