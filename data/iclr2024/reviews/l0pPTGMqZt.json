The authors introduce an algorithm, Fair and cONtrastive feature-space regularization algorithm for Domain-linked DG (FOND), designed to enhance the generalizability of domain-linked classes by leveraging representations from domain-shared classes. Through extensive experiments, FOND purportedly demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in DG tasks for domain-linked classes, provided a sufficient number of domain-shared classes are available. The paper also offers theoretical insights into the factors influencing the performance of domain-linked classes."

                "value": "(1) In section 5.2, the description of fairness is somewhat unclear. Is $M$ referring to the model, specifically the neural network? If so, it seems that the fairness loss is intended to reduce the classification loss gap between domain-linked and domain-shared classes, suggesting that minimizing the fairness loss aims to make the classification loss for both types of classes have similar values during training. However, it would be helpful to clarify how exactly this loss relates to fairness.\n\n(2) Does $\\beta$ in equation (4) have different values for each domain? If $\\beta$ is a unique value for all domains, then equation (4) can be rewritten as $...log\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} \\frac{exp(...)}{\\sum exp(...)}$. In this case, should we use $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$ as one hyperparameter instead of two separate hyperparameters ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$)? If so, $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$ would be similar to $\\lambda_{xdom}$.\n\n(3) In section A.3 of the appendix, the hyper-parameter selection and model selection process is not quite clear. It references evaluation settings for domains without distinguishing the source and target domains. Does the selection process use the target domain to evaluate the performance?"
