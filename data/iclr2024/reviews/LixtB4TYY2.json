To this end, a **tune-cross-evaluation** paradigm is proposed: Given a collection of VLIT datasets, the quality of a particular dataset (Dataset Quality, DQ) is measured by tuning a VLIT model on this dataset and evaluating on the remaining datasets. Based on this method, this paper evaluates 9 existing VLIT datasets and reports their quality.\n\nTo improve the quality of VLIT dataset, this paper merges multiple existing VLIT datasets and select data samples based on the proposed data sample quality (SQ), which is measured by how close a sample (when used for evaluation) matches the ability of the remaining datasets for tuning. The experiments suggest that (1) the merged dataset\u2019s quality outperforms any single dataset and (2) data samples selected by the SD metric are better than random selection."

A more reasonable setting is to exclude the specific tuning datasets in evaluation but include data samples with the corresponding ability.\n* According to Eq.3, SD prefers samples on which VLIT models perform well. This may exclude some noisy samples but could also exclude some challenging but meaningful samples.\n* Adding the constant 1 in Eq.2 seems unnecessary.\n\n### The experiments are insufficient to support some of the claims\n* Section 2.2 argues that: (1) MME involves human subjectivity in the data collection process (2) ChatGPT-based evaluation is inaccurate, which is not supported by any evidence and there is no comparison with the proposed evaluation method in these two aspects."

                "value": "The authors aim to understand the quality of the wide range of existing Vision-Language Instruction Tuning (VLIT) datasets. I believe that the problem is quite interesting and relevant to the field of generative multimodal modeling. However, I don\u2019t think that the proposed approach is sound and well-grounded. Hence, I believe that the paper needs to revisit their dataset quality and sample quality strategy.\n\nComments: \n\n- Specifically, the main strategy \u201ctune-cross-evaluation\u201d is based on the fact that a high-quality VLIT dataset is useful for performing well on the wide range of other VLIT datasets. This makes the comparison between the different VLIT datasets \u201cunequal\u201d since there is no fixed evaluation for every dataset. To support their decision, the authors mention that the existing benchmarks are ineffective in evaluating the quality of open-ended answers which I agree with. However, there are some datasets such as Visit-Bench [1] and Touchstone [2] which aim to solve this problem. If these datasets seem too recent to have been missed by the authors, I would cut some slack but would still like to see a fixed evaluation to understand what should training with the high-quality datasets be optimizing for. The authors do propose Eval600 but it is not utilized for calculating the dataset quality. It would have made more sense to me if the dataset quality was measured by fixing Eval600 as a target. \n\n- Let us consider Llava-De (LLaVA-Detailed Description) as D_T. Intuitively, it should be a very useful dataset for VLIT training. However, it achieves a low data quality in Figure 3. This is unexpected due to the nature of the dataset quality metric (Eq. 2) which essentially penalizes the dataset for being \u201cdifferent\u201d from other datasets.\n\n- What is the intuition between Eq. 1 for Meta-quality? To the best of my understanding, Rouge-L, Meteor, and BLEU capture similar facets of lexical or span-level similarity between the two texts. Why do we need to have all of them together? In this regard, the ablation study seemed equally random and not useful. At the core, it is hard to accept a new metric without showcasing that it has high correlation with human judgments for open-ended answers. [1] shows that GPT-4 based eval has the highest agreement with humans in comparison to ROUGE, Meteor, BLEU, BertScore. For instance, the model writes a poem based on a given image and one has a ground-truth poem in the dataset. How can ROUGE quantify the usefulness of the model generated poem by just comparing it with the ground-truth one? Here, GPT-4 and Human evaluation makes more sense.\n\n\n- Finally, I feel that the bi-directional nature of the quality measurements is quite confusing. Specifically, the data quality is defined based on its ability to train useful VL models (training direction), while sample quality is defined in terms of the ability of the other datasets to perform well on it (inference direction). \n\n- I am not sure why CIDEr was considered as a heldout metric while the others were considered as in-domain metrics. I think that the authors do a poor job at providing justifications for their choices.\n\n- I do not think that the quality of the refinement strategy is very good. Table 5 indicates the best CIDer numbers on SPLIT1 are 175.13 at 70% while 100% data gives 175.49. Is 0.36 point improvement worth going through SQ, MQ, DQ evaluations which require many extra training runs? Also I do not think the improvements are significant. On SPLIT2, we do not even observe an improvement in comparison to 100%. \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06595  \\\n[2] https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-VL/tree/master/touchstone"
