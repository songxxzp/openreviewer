The paper introduces a new adaptive scheduling strategy, termed \"spaced scheduling\", inspired by the spaced repetition learning method in humans. This approach dynamically selects the training data mix online, specifically tailored to the pre-trained model, eliminating the need for extensive studies on training data compositions. The results indicate that Spaced Scheduling surpasses random sampling, requires less training data, and prevents catastrophic forgetting.

Baselines: Though it is encouraging that this model improves over vanilla fine-tuning, this is not the only work in improving data quality/curriculum for fine-tuning. In terms of static pruning methods, one naive baseline is to filter sentences with too high or low perplexity (similar to high/low difficulty), as done [for pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04564). In terms of active learning methods, [Data diets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03208) performs a very similar algorithm to the one in this work, dynamically pruning based on a notion of sample importance (the related work of this paper also provides other references). I believe the paper should reflect this in two ways.\n    - The related work and contextualization of the current paper make it seem that this problem has not been studied before, which can be misleading. Better contextualizing the work in terms of prior research in this area will help highlight the novel contributions by this paper.\n    - Though the results provide an ablation study, it is unclear where prior work lies in this spectrum. Regardless of the motivation, this paper is providing a new method, and its important to contextualize its gains with respect to prior work. Though there are too many baselines to evaluate all, I would appreciate seeing a reasonable baseline to confirm that along some axis, this work pushes along various fine-tuning tradeoffs. \n2. Overhead: This algorithm should induce extra time overhead since examples have to be scored, and \"currently difficult\" examples may have to go through the model multiple times. The authors should report the time taken by both algorithms to evaluate this slowdown so one can evaluate whether this accuracy improvement is worth the additional cost.\n3. Connection to spaced repetition in psychology: From reading the paper, it is not clear to me how connected the algorithm is to spaced repetition learning for humans. According to the paper, spaced repetition says that \"brains retain information more effectively when we learn in multiple, spread-out sessions\". However, the actual algorithm proposed does not do this, and frames example selection under dynamic filtering based on example difficulty. Even if the analysis in Section 5.3 implies that the method is implicitly setting a curriculum, it is not clear to me how this connects to spaced repetition. I wonder what value the psychological motivation provides in the context of this work, and if there is a connection I'm missing in this regard.\n\nI am happy to adjust my score provided some further analysis along these axes."
