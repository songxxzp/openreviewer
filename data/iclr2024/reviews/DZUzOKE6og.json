One of the main contributions of the paper is hyperedge filling, but using only hyperedge filling (v1) in the ablation experiment is the worst among v1-v4.

Do all datasets in the experiments satisfy this assumption?\n2. I noticed that in section 5.1, the article uses a setting of 1% of the training set, which is different from most articles. Most other papers use fixed division or 5/10 nodes per category. I'm curious about what the considerations are for such an experimental setup?"

Per my reading of the proof, the value of $\\gamma$ (only need to be greater than 0) seems to not affect the result, while in practice this might not be true.
