                "value": "A new neural network-based visual reasoning pipeline is proposed that processes the language and visual tokens both parallelly and iteratively. The architecture is modular and consists of three parts that happen iteratively at each time step -- (a) Operation Formation where attention mechanisms are used between the input language tokens and existing operation states to form the operation vectors, (b) Operation Execution where the cross-attention between the operation vectors and the visual tokens yield the operation result vectors and (c) Operation Composition where the the operation vectors in memory are composed with other operation vectors at the current time step as well as prior operation states to form the states for the next time step using more cross attention mechanisms. The result of the reasoning process is then obtained using another cross-attention layer between the language vectors and operation result states to yield the final result. Experiments are performed on many standard visual reasoning datasets that test compositional visual question answering, generalization etc. Compared to simple cross-attention, concat attention and MAC (also a recurrent scheme), the results from the proposed method are favorable overall."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "One of the main things that needs to be addressed is the part of the architecture that does the parallel reasoning. From the architecture description, this seems to arise of the first dimension in the some of the internal state matrices of dimension $N_m$. Is it due to the masks in the Operation Composition stage that make these operations \"parallel\" so that these internal states attend to different parts of the input parallelly? I am trying to understand the difference between having a larger internal state versus explicit parallel reasoning. Where is the structure enforced in the architecture that requires parallel processing when possible?\n\nRelated to the above, there is one line that says identity attention is used to \"enable a higher degree of operation composition\". I don't follow this and needs clarity. Overall, I am not sure how this operation composition step is different and not just implicitly subsumed into earlier architectures, where is the parallel processing explicitly arising from?\n\nI think the iterative nature, on the other hand, is immediately due to the recurrent nature of the algorithm.\n\nThere seem to be many design decisions that are not immediately clear as being intuitive, and need further explanation. This is true of the Operation Composition stage. It seems to me that this stage is supposed keep a record of the operations performed up to a time step. It is said that operation states are composed with states from multiple time steps in the past. I don't follow this, isn't the M matrix already encoding memory of states in some way, why look back multiple time steps? This stage of the architecture is difficult to follow.\n\nThe visualizations in the supplement for one example seem to be pointing to some interesting aspects of the algorithm. But I don't see where the parallel reasoning is being utilized or even the iterative aspects. I think a clear explanation of the figure is needed, I don't understand how to interpret the memory states, the parallel processing, or how the prediction \"cylinder\" came into being. Perhaps visualizing other matrices and attention masks is also important here.\n\nMany more visualizations should be added to illustrate these important parts of the algorithm. Otherwise, it is hard to say whether it is indeed the parallel and iterative structure that is helping or a different issue.\n\nSome of these questions also arise because the numbers themselves are also hard to interpret. I don't see why test samples for \"logic\" type in Table 1 need parallel computation. The reasoning the authors provide are circular and seem to be based on the numbers themselves."
