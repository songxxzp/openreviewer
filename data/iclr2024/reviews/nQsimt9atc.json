For the white-box protection, they propose to use the signs of normalization layers in the NeRF model. They experimentally validate their method in aspects of fidelity, ownership verification with black/white-box schema, resilience against ambiguity attacks, and robustness against removal attacks, including model pruning and overwriting."

Scalability to explicit NeRF representations: To accelerate NeRF inference and rendering, multiple works [1,2,3] have proposed to use explicit representations (e.g., grid, mesh, and point cloud) instead of MLP as the NeRF representations. Modifying the weights of explicit NeRF representations seems to have a larger effect on the rendering quality as compared to implicit representations because it can be regarded as changing the location/color of the grid/mesh/point cloud. Thus, it is not sure whether the proposed protection framework can still maintain the rendering quality of those explicit NeRF representations.\n\n2. Insufficient details in \"False Positive Detection Prevention\": In Sec. A.5, the dataset used in this experiment is not mentioned. Does Fig. 5 show the averaged histogram for different scenes in a specific dataset or the histogram for a specific scene? The unprotected standard NeRF is claimed to be trained in the same dataset as a protected one. Is it trained on the same scene or a different scene but in the same dataset?\n\n3. Will the dataset affect the selection of ownership verification? A threshold of 0.75 is set for the black-box ownership verification, and the author claimed that 0.75 is selected \"as the visibility is still evident.\" However, it is uncertain whether different datasets have different optimal thresholds. For example, scenes in Unbound-360 [4] or ARKitScene [5] is more close to the real-world applications [6,7]. Will the optimal threshold still be 0.75 on those datasets?\n\n[1] https://creiser.github.io/merf/\n\n[2] https://mobile-nerf.github.io/\n\n[3] https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/\n\n[4] https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf360/\n\n[5] https://github.com/apple/ARKitScenes\n\n[6] https://poly.cam/gaussian-splatting\n\n[7] https://lumalabs.ai/interactive-scenes"
