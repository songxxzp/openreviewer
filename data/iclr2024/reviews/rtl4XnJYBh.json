It identifies two key mechanisms contributing to robustness: intra-class contrasting and inter-class feature sharing. These mechanisms help the model avoid over-reliance on misleading features and enhance its generalization capabilities, particularly in zero-shot classification tasks. The paper also highlights the positive impact of rich, detailed captions for improving model robustness."

                "value": "1. Lack of distinction from traditional approaches: The research does not sufficiently differentiate multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) from traditional single-modality contrastive learning. It's unclear what unique perspectives MMCL brings compared to these established analyses for conventional contrastive learning. Clarifying this distinction is crucial for understanding the specific contributions and innovations of MMCL.\n\n2. Assumptions about feature learning: The paper posits that intra-class contrasting allows for the learning of high-variance features, leading to the acquisition of generalizable core features beneficial for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, especially when annotated with text. However, it does not adequately explain or justify why this effect occurs. A more thorough explanation is needed to understand how intra-class contrasting specifically contributes to OOD generalization.\n\n3. Need for more intuitive theoretical explanations: The theoretical analysis could benefit from more intuitive explanations, examples, or visual aids. As it stands, the theoretical aspects may be challenging for readers to fully grasp, especially those unfamiliar with complex concepts in contrastive learning. Simplifying these explanations could make the research more accessible and understandable.\n\n4. Limitations of experiments: The credibility of the observations is somewhat compromised by the scale and nature of the experiments conducted. The use of small-scale or toy experiments raises questions about the findings' applicability in more complex, real-world scenarios. Future research would benefit from more extensive, large-scale experiments to test the theories in environments that more closely mimic real-world applications.\n\n5. Implications for method design of contrastive learning: The study falls short in outlining how the observations made could influence future designs of contrastive learning methods. While it discusses the mechanisms of MMCL and their benefits, there is a gap in guidance on applying these insights to the practical construction or improvement of next-generation contrastive learning models. Providing clearer, more detailed pathways from observation to application would enhance the paper's utility for future research and development in the field."

And what does coordinate k mean?\n3. Does rich details in the captions correlate with a high variance of features?\n4. In the experiments section, how is the different accuracy on In-domain distribution obtained?\n5. As the dataset scale is very different, the accuracy on ImageNet is quite small. Is CLIP trained from scratch on MSCOCO? Usually, CLIP models pre-trained on MSCOCO are evaluated on Flick30K. Are the numbers in Figure 2 reported as the average of ImageNet and its variations? To represent ID and OOD distribution, maybe it makes more sense to pre-train on ImageNet original version and evaluate on domain-shifted versions? In Figure.2b, the accuracy drops a lot as the label approach accuracy increases, does this indicate overfitting on the labels?\n6.
