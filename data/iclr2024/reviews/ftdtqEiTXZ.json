The proposed solution comprises of temporal block, spatial message-passing and a cycle message-passing where the cycled clique is realized with a Clique adjacency matrix \ud835\udc68c (a newly defined adjacent matrix). To this end, first, the three blocks are trivial as usual work, while second, the new solution is inherently a new design of 3D-adjacent matrix. For techniques, the construction process of Ac, how to identify the temporal clique (a temporal cyclic subgraph of the topological space) are lacking, and how the new adjacency contributes to final results is still unclear.

                "value": "In summary, I think the problem itself is very interesting, but the quality of this paper is not ready for publication yet. The main weaknesses of this paper are listed as follows:\n\n1. The contribution of this paper is not clear. For the theory part, Theorem 3.1 is a direct result/derivation from a corollary in [1]. Moreover, the connection between the theory and the proposed method is not explicitly shown in the paper. In other words, the theory does not bring any theoretical insights to the readers to understand the proposed method. For the methodology part, the clique adjacency matrix is proposed in [2], the embedding is proposed in [3], and the gated MLP is proposed in [4]. None of these major components within the proposed computing framework is new. Maybe stacking them together can lead to better empirical performance on some datasets, but it seems to be not enough for a publication, unless we have a deeper understanding of why this combination creates better results. I do not think the theory presented in the paper answers this question, at least not in its current form.\n\n2. It is hard to interpret the real contribution of the extra clique adjacency matrix based on the ablation studies. We do not know if the performance improvement comes from extra parameters (since an extra new block is added), or the newly added/rewired edges in the clique adjacency matrix. Moreover, we do not know if the clique adjacency matrix is the best way to add/rewire the edges regarding the performance. For example, spectrum-based rewiring approaches [5, 6] have been widely adopted to resolve the oversquashing issue for graph classification tasks. So I believe more discussions are needed to claim the importance of the usage of clique adjacency matrix.\n\n3. The writing of this paper can be improved. Some sentences do not read well, and some notations are not explained. For example, on page 2, $Z=\\sigma(HU)$, what is $H$ here? Since the input is $X$, should it be $Z=\\sigma(XU)$? Again on page 2, $s(Z) = Z_1 \\odot Proj(Z_2)$, what is exactly the linear projection? Maybe it is better to just keep the original notation which makes more sense, $f_{W,b}(Z)=WZ+b, s(Z)=Z_1 \\odot f_{W,b}(Z_2)$. On page 8, what does \"tiny attention\" refer to? Maybe a reference or a short explanation will help the reader better understand the case study part.\n\n[1] Allen Hatcher. Algebraic Topology.

However, in practice, we usually have a (spatial) graph/network that changes dynamically. In the case of long-term traffic forecasting, the changes in the network can be a) some sensors are down due to technical issues; b) rearrangement of the sensors. How would the proposed method change when the graphs can change over time?\n\n2. In intro the authors claim that \"the proposed model not only exhibits minimal computational cost but also proves to be highly efficient\", but the comparison between the computational costs is not presented in the paper.
