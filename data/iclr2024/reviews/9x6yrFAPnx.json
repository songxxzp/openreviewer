                "value": "1. My main concern is that the algorithm 1 is quite close to [1]. It seems that algorithm 1 is just an application of REP-UCB in Augmented MDPs. The analysis of regret bound is also similar to [1], with only difference to convert CVaR into value function (as Eq. (13) in Page 17), which makes the result not so surprising and significant. It is likely that I miss some novel analysis techniques, so please bring it out and I think it is also important to stress the novelty in the paper.\n\n2. The authors claim the worse dependency of regret bound on $H^7$ is due to the non-stationary transitions in Page 7. I want to point out it may be wrong. Another previous work considers regular low-rank MDPs with finite horizons and time-dependent transition kernels [2], which is the same as this paper, even has better dependence on $H^3$. It is likely that the worse dependency on $H$ of this paper is due that [1,2] assume that the accumulative discounted reward is in $[0,1]$ and this paper only assumes $[0,H]$. I guess that applying similar assumptions and techniques to clip value functions in [2], the regret bound may acheive the same dependence on $H^3$.\n\n3. Based on the two points above, I think the authors can try to enhence this paper by buliding a lower bound of CVaR RL under low-rank MDPs with better dependence on $\\tau$, or try to improve the algorithm to better regret bound.\n\n[1] Masatoshi Uehara, Xuezhou Zhang, and Wen Sun.

Furthermore, the authors introduce a discretized variant of the least-squares value iteration approach and demonstrate its capacity to approach near-optimal policy solutions within a polynomial computational time framework, given access to a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) oracle. This novel contribution enhances the body of knowledge in this area of research, delivering valuable insights to the academic community."

If this is indeed required, it is a major assumption that the authors fail to disclose in the abstract or in a formal statement. I strongly encourage the authors to highlight this fact.\n\n(-) Again, suppose my understanding of the above is correct. In that case, the result becomes fairly trivial: combining the realizability assumptions with a finite model class (assumption 3.2) with access to a simulator, it is easy to see that given enough samples, any algorithm is no-regret. Nevertheless, there is still credit in proving finite-sample regret bounds in Theorem 4.1.\n\n(-) The claim that this is the first provably efficient CVaR RL algorithm is incorrect. There have been regret bounds for CVaR RL in function approximation settings in the literature. \n\n(-) I also encourage the author to at least discuss the difference between dynamic and static CVaR, as this has non-trivial implications in algorithm design and theoretical analysis."

This is a very weird policy to me. First the agent follows the policy to state $s_h$ then takes a uniform action $a_h \\sim U(\\mathcal{A})$ and receives the next state $s_{h-1} \\sim P_h(\\cdot | s_h,a_h)$. If the agent is taking uniform actions in step $h$ then how is it following policy $\\pi_k$. Wasn't $s_h$ the state the resulted in taking a uniform action $a_{h-1}$ in the previous state $s_h$?
