None of the experimental results include such dataset. Infact all of the datasets were generated using a solution for some known dynamical systems. Please look at the questions section for more details.\n- Contribution:\n    - Contribution of the paper is not clear.

In most cases, however, it seems the choice of test systems are chaotic which are exceptionally sensitive to initial condition/parameters. How robust are these discovery systems? since the data are samples from some solution which can be wildly different depending on the initial conditions."

Vet little any attention has been given to actual spline driven fitting of reconstructed track and learning the equation parameters. I find that many of the notations in figure 1 still remain undescribed and the paper jumps from writing about YoLo V8 (perhaps for object detection), \"learning\" 3D trajectory (which looks like reconstructing 3D from 2D detections) to equation fitting which is regression. Are these three different stages of proposed pipeline of everything is learned end to end? \n\n- The paper boasts heavily of being the first one to find these dynamics from images. All presented results however are on synthetic data and does not really justify an expansive 3 camera setup to track and 3D reconstruct the object locations. Authors did not explain well what the type of objects one might want to track, and the challenges associated with the same. Tracking square and star projections using three cameras and YoLo8 seems an overkill and even if one can do so what is novel in doing so?\nI think the paper could do with devoting more time in explaining why the discovery of dynamics is important and how the proposed setup helps in tracking the real objects better for the same. I understand the challenges in getting the real data for the problem at hand but think it is extremely important to present with some real results - even qualitative results with 2D/3D tracking could work leaving the equation discovery out of evaluation."
