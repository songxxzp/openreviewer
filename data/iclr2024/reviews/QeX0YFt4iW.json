Besides, there also exist some questions. \n\n1. The authors only present a solution for a multi-modal adversarial attack via attacking two modalities and selecting a prominent one. I cannot capture the core problem in the multi-modal adversarial attack and difficulties. Please make a thorough illustration. \n2. The evaluation metric designed by the authors is confusing. The paper evaluates PSNR between the original generated image and the adversarial generated image, but I am not sure whether this comparison pair has convincing effects.  I understand the authors aim to estimate the generation effect, but directly comparing two generated images seems to lack stable indications. \n3. The adversarial between the two modalities has no relationship in the paper, also verified in Table 1. Under this condition, I think the paper requires further improvement. \n4. Please clarify the differences in the utilization of SD-2-1, SD-1-4, and SD-1-5.\n5. The imperceptibility has no visible verification."
