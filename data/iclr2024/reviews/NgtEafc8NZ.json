Below eqn (2), the text says \"$a_{t,j}$ defines the $j$th action in state $s_t$\". Does this mean $j$ is enumerating the collected transitions (presumably in a buffer)? Or is this following some other distribution - what distribution would that be? \n  - In eqn (4), since you are no longer summing over $j$, do you still need $\\frac{1}{K}$? \n  - Right above eqn (3), could you clarify what \"upper bound\" and \"lower bound\" this sentence is referring to, and why \"truncated importance weights can provide an upper bound\"? \n- The introduction mentions \"upper bounds of actual Bellman error\" - I assume this is referring to eqn (4) - however it was not explicitly stated around eqn (4). \n  - How was Jensen's inequality used to derive eqn (4) from eqn (2)? Could walk through this explicitly. \n- Connection to Mahmood et al. 2014\n  - In that referenced paper, the authors considered linear function approx setting and presented two importance sampling approaches for off-policy learning. \n  - What they call OIS-LS and WIS-LS seems to correspond to the difference between eqn (2) vs eqn (4). Specifically, their WIS-LS objective is $J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_k \\rho_k (Y - \\theta^{\\intercal} \\phi_k)$, which basically corresponds to eqn (4) of this paper $L(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{t} \\rho_t (V_\\theta(s_t) - (r_t + \\gamma V_{\\bar{\\theta}}(s_{t+1}))^2$ except now $V_\\theta$ is used in place of a linear function. \n  - The core idea of the current proposed approach seems to be simply extending the linear case to general function approximation. Is there any other difference? Either way, this connection should be explicitly stated, perhaps citing the mathematical formulation as well. Of course, I understand the prior work did not consider any continuous control benchmarks, and the contribution of this work is still valuable. But I believe the connection should be made clear. \n- The conclusion states \"proposed a novel approach applying trust region methods in the off-policy setting\" -- is that the main contribution? Or is learning V-function instead of Q-function the contribution. \n\nMinor issues: \n- typo on page 4 paragraph 2 \"Bellmann\" -> \"Bellman\"\n- typo on page 6 \"populate]\"\n- typo on page 8 conclusion \"an novel approach\" -> \"a novel approach\""

                "value": "### Clarity & quality\n**Important details on the value loss function are missing and unclear**: \n\nThe main contribution of this is the use of a surrogate objective for the value function learning. However, the deduction of this new surrogate objective lacks important explanations. \n1. \u201caccomplish this by relaxing the squared loss function from Equation 2 using Jensen\u2019s inequality\u201d. It is not straightforward to me how to use Jensen\u2019s inequality to obtain $L(\\theta)$. Why we can move the ratios just outside of the square? \n2.  In Equation (4), the paper just subsumes the summation over $j$ into the sum over $t$. I\u2019m not sure quite how this can be done, given that the summation over $j$ \u201cimplicitly assumes multiple action executions per state\u201d. But the $L(\\theta)$ in Equation (4) clearly does not have such implicit assumption. Further, in the subsequent sections, there is no discussion on this, and Algorithm 1 just presents a single-action estimate for the loss. \n\n### Significance\n**Some conclusions and statements may need to be further justified**\n1. **the conclusion from the cited work may not carry over straightaway to the value estimation in this paper**. Specifically, \u201cthe new loss function is an upper bound of the original loss function and shares the same optima\u201d. However, in the cited work (Neumann & Peters, 2008), the proof is for the value estimation of $\\pi$ with a given Q and samples generated by the same policy (if I understand correctly). This is different from objective function in Equation (4), which is estimated using target networks and the off-policy samples.  Can the authors provide a theoretical proof for this convergence to the same optima? Also, regarding \u201csolving the relaxed loss should yield results consistent with the original loss\u201d, does it mean that the final loss will be consistent? Or the final policy will be the same? \n\n2. **It is unclear how the proposed state-value-estimation can be useful for the algorithm**: Particularly, the proposed algorithm is a combination of the multiple independent ideas: state value estimation, target networks, trust region projection, Gaussian policy approximation, replay buffer and importance weight truncation. Any of these ideas can be crucial and contributive for the strong empirical performance. It would be hard to detach the state value estimation from the other components and claim that the proposed state value estimation is the key. \n  \n3. **Further empirical studies are needed to verify the proposed idea**: the main empirical results only show the evaluation reward/returns for the trained policies. They are insufficient to show if the proposed value estimation objective can be better in learning an accurate value estimate. Particular, those strong performance of Vlean can be (very likely) a result from other implementation tricks. The paper should consider using Monte Carlo estimate to compare the estimated values with Vlean and the groundtruth values. Moreover, the ablation studies on the replay buffer size are irrelevant to the main idea of the proposed value estimate and should be substituted with a more informative study, e.g., with/without the ratios when optimization $L(\\theta)$. The current ablation studies give no clue on the state-value-function estimation."
