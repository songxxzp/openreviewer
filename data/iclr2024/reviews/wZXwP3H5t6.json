These are my main issues with the paper:\n1- In Eq 1, is L_eval is a loss (where lower is better), it seems trivial to find subnetworks that perform less well than the original DNN. So I imagine L_eval is not a loss (as the L would suggest), but some performance metric where higher is better. Even in that case the problem is not fully defined, since F_yi = F would satisfy Eq 1 while not being an useful solution.\n2- I find the writing of the paper very hard to follow. How are the semantic clusters built? I\u2019m not sure I could follow the explanation in section 4 and algo 1, which is a bit too cluttered. Something as important for the method as the Discriminative Capability Score is not actually explained anywhere. Same issue with the training of the route predictor.\n3- Even in section 3, which introduces the main setting of the methodology, the authors already mention many elements that would rather pertain to the experimental section, like specific architectures and hyperparameter choices.\n4- The authors claim to obtain SOTA results while using relatively old datasets and architectures. I don\u2019t think such a choice invalidates the contribution, but I would weigh the claims accordingly.\n5- What is Fig 1top supposed to convey? It doesn\u2019t seem to show anything. If the idea is to show the difference in sparsity, a simply plot with the sparsity level of each layer would work better."

In turn, appropriate cluster-specific sub-graphs of the base network can be detected and then executed for inference based on the assigned cluster of each object. To do so, the considered approach introduces Discriminative Capability Score (DCS)  , a general purpose method aiming to find filters that can distinguish between semantically similar classes. In experimental evaluations on the CIFAR-10/100 datasets using different benchmark architectures (VGG16, VGG19, RN50), DCS yielded significant improvements compared to other SOTA methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Despite the novelty of the approach, there are some significant issues that need to be addressed, and the main element missing from the main text, at least in my personal view, is clarity. Up until (and including) Section 3, the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The intuition and motivation are very clear. \n\nAfter that, the presentation of the method is very confusing. \n\nWe begin with the definition of the DCS procedure, where the notation keeps changing. The authors start with a given layer $l$ and semantic cluster $\\gamma_m$ (where up to this point, it is not clear if $\\gamma_m$ comes from some ground truth information or is computed as the introduction suggested). For each datapoint belonging to the semantic cluster, the activations for each feature map $\\boldsymbol A_{l, c_i}^j$ are computed and adaptive pooling is perfomed. Then, the feature map is flattened by the dependence on $l$ is gone. This is the first instance that breaks the flow of reading the paper. This trends continues by introducing $\\boldsymbol F^j$ which concatenates all the features for all the filters in the layer and $N_f$ is introduced (again layer-specific with no dependence). The same goes for $\\boldsymbol W*$ that seems to be dependent on both $\\gamma_m$ and $l$. Using some normalization, we then compute the desired DCS value, which again is layer and cluster specific but this is not clear from the notation. \n\nThen, the SINF procedure is presented. The authors present the steps, most of which are not yet introduced. It would be better to first introduce the procedures and then tie them together, instead of noting that everything will be explained later. \n\nHere, the authors note that before deployment, the DCS is used to construct semantic subgraphs. Again is not yet clear how are the partitions obtained. Do the authors use the training set of CIFAR-10/100 that are already somehow prepartitioned into semantic clusters, e.g., the superclasses of CIFAR-100, and use algorithm 2 to extract the subgraphs? Because this is the first step of the approach, that always takes as an input the Partitioned Data. \n\nMoving on to the process of extracting the sub-graphs, we begin with $L$ and $M$, the last layer and the layer before the Common Feature Extractor. In this context, if $L$ is the last layer of (assuming) the backbone network, isn't $M$ also the layer of said network? In Fig.3 there is no illustration of what $L$ and $M$ since they backbone is not shown. The input is just passed through the common feature extractor and a sub-graph is selected without a corresponding backbone. \n\nThe authors use $X$ to denote the number of retained filters in a layer $X$. Again confusing notation, $X$ are the data, and even though it's easy to understand the difference, clarity is reduced. The authors can just use $r_l$ for any layer $l$. The authors note that for each layer $M \\leq l \\leq L$ the $r_l$ is calculated; however, in Algorithm 2, $r_L$ and $r_M$ are given as an input and also updated in the process. At the same time the authors note \"This procedure is performed for different values of $r_L$ and $r_M$. In this paper, $r_L$ is set between 90% and 10%, with steps of 10, while $r_M$ is set between 10% and 1%, with steps of 2\". Why is this procedure performed? Is this some kind of initialization? What happens with the multiple different values? Do the authors select some kind of best performing model? And in this context, what is the intuition behind the computation of $r_l$? It seems to be dependent on the current layer number $M, L, r_M$, and  $r_L$ but how the values affect the results is not clear. \n\nTurning to the classifier, the authors note that the classifier is attached to some $l$-th layer. This layer is the earliest layer that provides good prediction for semantic routes is chosen. What does it mean that the layer provides good predictions for semantic routes? Do the authors try to match the output of this classifier to the potential $K$ clusters (which at this point I will assume stem from ground truth information)? How was the $75$% accuracy was decided? What if for some setting the $l$-th layer is the last layer of the network? What is the impact of different values for this threshold? \n\nIn the experimental section, the authors introduce the notation for the confidence threshold as $\\gamma$, which is also used for the partitions $\\gamma_i$. Again, even though it is something distinct, notation clarity should be improved. \n\nOther points:\n\nIn the context of pruning methods, there exist a plethora of methods that perform pruning end-to-end during training, balancing accuracy and sparsity. Characteristic examples include [1,2,3]. However, one argument that the authors make is that all the (referenced) methods require fine-tuning after pruning, which may be true for the methods that the authors cite but not for all pruning methods. Unless the authors refer to post-hoc pruning methods, in which again there exist methods that consider solvers to balance accuracy and sparsity without any further fine-tuning [4].\n\nI find the definition of the Semantic DNN Subgraph Problem a bit misdefined. The equation itself seems to indicate that the average loss of the partitions should be less or equal to the full network loss; this however can be true for any configuration of the sub-graphs (even random) and restricts solutions that can even perform better, e.g., due to avoiding parameter redundancy. The authors note that $\\mathcal{L}$ is the evaluation metric, but the $\\mathcal{L}$ notation is commonly the loss function in the literature and not the classification accuracy that the authors consider. And in the regression setting, e.g., using MSE as an evaluation metric leads to a different interpretation of the problem setting.\n\nThe fact that the evaluation is only assessed on CIFAR-10/100 undermines the impact of the approach. Indeed, these datasets are considered \"small\" datasets and the authors should assert the generalization capabilities and performance on more demanding datasets and settings, such as ImageNet-1k. At the same time, evidently the algorithms depends on ground truth information about the semantic clusters of the data. If we do not have access to this kind of information, it's not clear: (i) what semantic clusters we should consider, and (ii) how will the algorithm perform in this setting. \n\nOverall, despite the novelty of the proposed framework, presentation and clarity should be greatly improved. At the same time, important  details (like the $r_l$ computation) are not justified, while important ablation studies in the various effects of parameters/settings are missing. \n\n[1] Louizos et al., Bayesian Compression for Deep Learning, In Proc.

There are a lot of existing pruning methods, e.g., DepGraph: Towards Any Structural Pruning\nbut this paper does not provide any comparison to existing works\n\n2. The acceleration on CIFAR10/CIFAR100 is not satisfied.\nFor example, DepGraph achieves an 8.92\u00d7 acceleration with a 3.11 loss in accuracy on CIFAR100 with VGG19.\nHowever, the results provided by the author (~1.72x and 2.83 loss on acc) are worse than previous work.\n\n3. The writing is confusing, it is hard to find the main results.\n\n4. This method applies an additional predictor to discriminate which hyper-class the input should be, which introduces extra inference cost and training effort. Does the provided inference time include the inference time on the additional predictor? Another concern is that the extra network will hurt model generalization ability.\n\n## Minor\n\n1. The authors provided an anonymous GitHub link to share code, but it is an empty link."
