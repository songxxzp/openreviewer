Additionally, there is potential to simplify the formulaic aspect.\n- It would be beneficial if the author could emphasize their novel contribution, distinguishing it from the techniques previously proposed by others. Currently, these ideas seem to be mixed within the intricate details of the interpretations.\n- The overall architecture, as well as certain smaller techniques and theoretical analysis methods, seem to be largely derived from previous work.\n- The contribution on the coreset construction is limited. Although the authors introduce a new coreset objective, they do not provide sufficient NEW optimization techniques for the new objective. I could only identify some techniques borrowed from previous work.\n- In my opinion, the primary contribution of this paper is the modified objective (eq. 9) tailored to personalized federated learning. However, the advantages of this modified objective are not adequately elucidated in the current presentation.\n\nsome minor problems\n\n- In section 3, there is a confusion of n and N. For example, n in Fig 1 should be N. \n- In section 3.2 , it should be $ g_j = \\mathcal{P}_\\theta(\\mathcal{D}_j^i) = E_{\\theta\\sim \\hat{\\pi}} P_\\theta(\\mathcal{D}_j^i) $.\n- The subscript of the bold variable should not be bolded if it is a scalar.\n- many other typos, e.g. missing equation references and confusing sentence like \u201cFor the first term in Equation 1, the authors we use a minibatch stochastic gradient descent \u2026\u201d"

                "value": "- What is the benefits to apply coreset in the personalized federated learning? I think one of the most important is that it can reduce the communication complexity. It would be valuable to investigate and quantify the extent to which the coreset approach reduces communication complexity in the specific optimization task addressed in this work. This can be done theoretically, by providing a complexity formula, and practically, by presenting numerical results from experiments that show the reduction in communication complexity achieved.\n- the intuition behind the new objective in eq. 9 is not very persuasive. If you could compute a coreset with a sufficiently small loss as defined in eq. 3, it is unecessary to add the term representing the \u201cdistance\u201d between $\\hat{q}^i(\\theta, w)$ and $\\hat{q}^i(\\theta)$ since $\\hat{q}^i(\\theta, w)$ and $\\hat{q}^i(\\theta)$ will lead to closed losses; On the other hand, if you couldn\u2019t make it under the constraint $\\| w \\|_0 \\leq k$, which means there is no such small coreset with ideal error, the coreset method could not work well. It would be beneficial to clarify the merits of the new objective, such as its robustness or any other advantages it offers. Experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the new objective would greatly strengthen the argument.\n- Does the modifications of eq. 6 consist of the following two parts: i) use the weighted likelihood. ii) replace prior distribution with global distritution. I am not sure for that.\n- is there any strategy for choosing the value of k in practice?"
