They collect crystal text descriptions based on Robocrystallographer too. Could you compare your dataset with theirs about the text content and text quality? Showing the advantage of your dataset is important for your contribution to data collection.\n\n(2). Section 5.1 \u201cThe possible reason for this improvement might be that LLMProp can easily access the most important information for volume prediction, e.g. space group information, from the text descriptions compared to GNNs.\u201d Could you please make some more ablation about your text information to prove your statement? Also, this is important to measure the importance of different types of information.\n\n(3). Could you please make a task description to show the importance of the two tasks (Band gap and volume) in the experiments? Many other properties are predicted in related works such as energy per atom and bulk modulus. Why did you choose these two tasks?"
