Whereas [1] uses general and in particular nonlinear forward process, this work uses a Brownian bridge where the bridge conditioned on end points can now be sampled in closed form and the forward h-transform is also known. Although this is not useful for the applications considered in [1], it is useful for generative modelling where one does not care about the reference process.\n- The work is well explained and is essentially a continuous time version of [2], which does not detail the time reversal interpretation very well and does not condition on the end marginal in the network, but does in the h-transform.\n- Ultimately this is a conditional bridge matching approach which seems to empirically have a better coupling than non conditioned bridges.\n\n[1] Heng et al.

                "value": "**Novelty**\nUltimately this work trains a conditional diffusion model through score matching, and conditioning on the terminal state x_T from a given coupling. The difference to regular diffusion models is simply conditioning the forward process as well as the backward process with additional information from a coupling. This can also be viewed as conditional bridge matching, by matching the reverse bridge.\n\nAlthough I very much like the connection to bridge matching, time reversal and diffusion bridges, this is not discussed to a satisfactory standard.\n\n**Lack of discussion to prior work**\n\nThe authors' work severely lacks a detailed related works section. Many related works and contributions have been briefly commented in passing. Without proper acknowledgement prior work, the authors' contributions appear inflated. \n\n1) Lacking reference [2], this appears to be the same idea but for discrete interpretation of diffusion models / bridge, derived through a variational approach similar to DDPM rather than time reversal - but which are well known to be equivalent. [2] does not condition on the end marginal in the network, but does in the h-transform.\n\n2) Lack of discussion to bridge matching prior work\n\nThere is a lack of discussion to [1,4,5,6,9], which the authors are aware of given these papers are cited. Although phrased differently they appear highly related to this work. [1,4,6,9] similarly sample from a coupling and train a network for the drift of the of the backward or forward diffusion process (which also involves a h transform), but not conditioned on a one of the marginal points. This work considers learning the the drift of the backward process by learning the score (the score and h-transform (forward drift) make up the reverse drift, as shown in [5]), but instead conditioned on the starting point, x_T. I imagine this work is essentially a conditional bridge matching approach.\n\nAs discussed above, [5] is highly related in that the high level approach is the same: train a network between two points by reversing a diffusion bridge. The differences lie in [5] focusing on general / nonlinear forward process for sampling bridges rather than generative modelling. [5] requires simulating the forward diffusion as nonlinear forward bridges cannot be sampled in closed form. [5] is for a fixed pair rather than amortized across pairs. Indeed, to further illustrate the similarities **Equation 6 within Theorem 1 of this work appears to coincide with the equation written below Equation (4) in Section 2.1 of [5].**. \n\n3) Misrepresenting prior work\n\nThe authors claim \"A related work (Somnath et al.,2023) similarly establishes a diffusion bridge that translates between two distributions and has seen success in protein differentiable domain, but the training objective requires sampling an entire SDE trajectory for computation\".\n\nAs far as I am aware this is not true. I do not understand how the authors came to this conclusion.\n\nMinor:\n-  is it not clear why [3] is being cited for the Schrodinger bridge interpretation of diffusion models. The approach of [3] is not a Schrodinger bridge between marginals but two diffusion models back to back with a Gaussian between, there are significantly more relevant works. If anything this is misleading the reader.\n\n- \"A recent work (Liu et al., 2023) considers a special case of SB\" . I2I SB [9] does not actually result in a Schrodinger Bridge, neither does the same method detailed in Aligned SB [1]. They both perform bridge matching with respect to Brownian bridge reference diffusion but for a data driven coupling. Given the data driven coupling does not correspond to the coupling from Brownian motion, the bridge matching procedure returns a Markovian projection and hence breaks the coupling. See discussion in [7] \"the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge is the unique path measure which satisfies the initial and terminal conditions, is Markov and is in the reciprocal class of Q, see (L\u00e9onard, 2014b).\" One needs to iterate on the coupling and drift in order to obtain a SB. \n\nThis is a tangential remark as one does not need an optimal diffusion in order to perform conditional generation if it can be supervised with given paired samples from a coupling. However there appears to be many errors in papers being published in this area and I feel this should be addressed.\n\n**Claim of generalizing flow matching/ bridge matching**\n\nThe connection of diffusion bridges to flow matching has been established and detailed in [7], detailing the limit as the noise coefficient goes to 0. The original flow matching paper [8] is even derived using result from [4] on bridge matching, so this is widely known. Note: [7] was public well before submission but not published.\n\nHowever, given the score function in this work is conditioned on x_T, the learnt backward diffusion is non-Markovian, hence retains the initial marginal coupling and would not recover rectified flow / schrodinger bridge by iterative Markovian fitting as in [7] or in rectified flow. So I would argue this work does not subsume flow matching / drift matching.\n\n**Summary**\nWhilst I like the core idea of this paper and believe there is a contribution, I believe \"contextualization relative to prior work\" is lacking.\n\n[1] Somnath et al 2023, Aligned Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridges \\\n[2] Li et al 2022, BBDM: Image-to-Image Translation with Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models \\\n[3]  Su et al. 2022, Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges for Image-to-Image Translation \\\n[4] Peluchetti 2022, Non-Denoising Forward-Time Diffusions \\\n[5] Heng et al.

DDBMs work by building a stochastic bridge between a paired samples. DDBMs share several attributes with diffusion models, which allows reusing many of the techniques already available in this field. These new models can be trained in a similar fashion as score matching, and the authors present extensive theoretical backing to allow for a loss formulation and transport between distributions via a reverse SDE and flow ODE. The authors show results in image-to-image tasks with reasonable results. The authors also show competitive results when running tasks currently done by diffusion models, mainly text-to-image generation."

The experiments are very thorough, and the doob-h formulation is sound.\n\nUnfortunately, this paper is written in a way that highlights some misconceptions. It is unclear what the authors see as the contribution of this paper. It has become clear from the wider literature than just the narrow perspective of the same score-based diffusion equation how to do image-to-image translation. In fact, the works that this paper already cite do this, even for both the ODE and SDE between arbitrary densities. \n\nA quick summary of related work that should be properly addressed in this paper, and the authors should highlight what actually sets this method apart:\n- [1,2,3] propose a means of learning an ODE to do connect any two densities, e.g. for your image-to-image translation in finite time $ t \\in [0,1]$ without bias. In fact [1] does this image-to-image translation experiment there directly.\n- [4] shows how to do this for **both** an ODE and an SDE (with the score), also in finite time. It also shows how to avoid the added complexity of doob, and how SBDM is a subcase.\n- [5, 6] shows the influence of changing the coupling $p(x_0, x_1)$ between the densities $p(x_0)$, $p(x_1)$\n- [7] also shows how to use either and ODE or SDE to connect the densities under varying coupling. \n\nThe related worked section, in addition to the intro, should be thoroughly reworked to not overlook these clear contributions. While it is certainly beneficial to have a clear connection to how to do this with SBDM using doob-h and experiments of it, the paper is currently written so as to suggest that there is a clear need to come up with tools to do this as if many works have not addressed it. The reviewer is sympathetic to the fact that this field moves very fast, but also believes that overselling a concept by overlooking other work is detrimental to the field. \n\nWith regards to the statement that the ODE based methods [1,2,3] \"tend to severely underperform when compared to diffusion models,\" there is no evidence of this presented, and in fact the purpose of those papers is to present evidence of the contrary, e.g. see [3]. If the authors would like to make this statement, they should demonstrate it in experiments. It is of the reviewers mindset that the differentiating factor between most simulation-free transport generative models is just whether or not the model was conditionally trained, e.g. as $s(x,y,t)$ vs $s(x,t)$. Many papers report \"unconditional sampling\" FIDs by training a conditional model and using a null-token e.g. $y=-1$ to sample unconditionally, which improves their score.\n\nThere is perhaps a misinterpretation of what optimal transport is, and what role it may play in generative models that are constructed from continuous-time transport plans. The authors refer to \"VE (OT)\" bridges without providing a clear definition of what they mean by OT. Here are the two ways to learn an optimal transport between distributions:\n\n- 1. Choose the optimal coupling $p(x_0, x_1)$, with \"schedule\" $x_t = (1-t)x_0 + tx_1$. This is hard to do, and why people rely, e.g. on Sinkhorn.\n- 2. For independent coupling $p(x_0)p(x_1)$, learn a process $x_t = f_{\\theta}(t,x_0,x_1)$ which gives a time dependent velocity/score and density $v_t, p_t(x)$ that induces a minimum action (or least transport cost) in terms of Benamou-Brenier transport cost.\n\n- In the abstract, the authors reference \"OT-Flow-Matching\", though the work [3] does not propose to solve OT. At most ,they use a relationship about McCann displacement maps (which is related to OT from a Gaussian to a Gaussian) to motivate choosing a straighter conditional probability path -- they are not doing OT. \n\n\n-Throughout the text, the authors need to make sure all acronyms are defined.\n\n- The introduction of the weighting factor in equation (13) is not shown in the text to preserve an exact/unbiased transport. The authors should justify this or state that it introduces a bias, even if a beneficial one.\n\n\n*The reviewer is not opposed to adjusting their score, but there are many organizational and presentational aspects of this work that suggest it is not fit for contribution to the larger body of work at ICLR at this stage.

They discuss a higher-order Euler-Maruyama sampler, but it is unclear if all the comparison to other methods used the same integrator. Many of the methods listed could use a different integrator for the same trained model, and it's unclear to the reviewer what was held fixed across comparisons and what wasn't. The reviewer points this out to stress that a paper is not a method -- the method presented in the paper should be recognizably connected to the conclusions of the experiments. If an auxiliary factor influenced the outcome, e.g. like choosing a better sampler, this diminishes the message about the method itself."
