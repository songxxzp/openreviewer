This means the titular contribution of the paper is not original.\n- There is a lot of hyperparameter tuning that might be unfairly benefiting CrossQ. For instance, the network width for CrossQ is increased from 256 to 2048 units, an 8x increase. Adam\u2019s momentum parameter was also reduced from 0.9 to 0.5. As far as I can tell, these hyperparameters were not tested for the baselines, so CrossQ has been over-optimized for MuJoCo. A fairer comparison would be testing the methods with the same network sizes and then selecting the best Adam hyperparameters for each of them.\n- I feel that the claim of \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d performance is a bit strong given that only 6 MuJoCo environments were tested, and CrossQ is a clear improvement only in 2 of them. The method has not been evaluated in other continuous-control problems nor against other potential baselines, so I would not necessarily agree that it is state-of-the-art. Nevertheless, the empirical results are still great.\n\n**Minor Edits**\n- Inconsistent use of hyphens should be fixed. For example, \u201cQ-function\u201d and \u201cQ function\u201d both appear in the paper.\n- Possible typo in Figure 2\u2019s caption: \u201ca **single double** Q function network\u201d?\n- As Equation 1 is currently written, it is not correct to refer to the Polyak averaging parameter $\\tau$ as \u201cmomentum\u201d since $\\tau=1$ corresponds to a moving average with no inertia.\n- References are not consistently formatted, e.g., some conference names are capitalized but others are not."

Please clarify\n\nIf you could show some evidence on the suspicion that the reason for prior approaches being unable to use BatchNorm effectively is the OOD-ness of the actions from the policy that are not sampled from the batch in the target networks, that would be great as well since it is I think one of the key insights (i.e. visualize the distributions of sampled and policy actions)."

                "value": "1. Can you elaborate on the specific scenarios or domains where CrossQ might outperform other algorithms significantly? Are there any limitations or challenges in which CrossQ may not be the most suitable choice?\n\n2. The paper focuses on empirical results; however, are there any insights or intuitions on why the chosen modifications (removal of target networks, Batch Normalization, wider networks) lead to the observed improvements? Providing additional context on the underlying mechanisms would enhance the paper's impact.\n\n3. To me, I think using wider critic networks played a pivot role in the performance boost, especially in humanoid-based environments. Can you draw SAC+wider networks to Figure 7?\n\nI would be happy to raise my scores if my concerns are addressed."
