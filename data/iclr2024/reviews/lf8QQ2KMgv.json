Second and more importantly, it is natural to expect that changing the optimization objective or including different regularization techniques, architectures, etc would impact the findings. After all, the previous work focuses on one particular setup, which would of course make their findings difficult to transfer to new setups.\n- Because the setup has changed in certain ways, one may expect different train points to be memorized. Hence, the change in the accuracy should be computed after the points memorized *in this setup* are removed (not the ones reported in the reference paper). \n- The analysis is only done for one dataset while the reference paper considers three datasets, which restricts the generality of the findings in this paper.\n- More than half of the original memorized points are included in the new training set. In other words, the post-pruning training dataset has a bigger size, which would naturally incur a smaller change in accuracy; hence comparing the reported accuracy change (0.54) against the original number (2.54) would not be fair."

The stated issues do not necessarily contradict the findings of the previous work, especially in the case of the \"Sub-population Shift\" argument, which I will explain further in my review. Therefore, this paper may not be suitable for this particular venue and might be better suited as a workshop paper or considered for the reproducibility track to facilitate further experimentation and validation of the results.\n\nI am strongly leaning towards rejecting the paper; however, I will try to provide my understanding, concerns, and suggestions for the authors so they can reevaluate their work and make a better presentation of their study.\n\nConcerns, understanding, and suggestions: \n1. The introduction section does not adequately define the problem, and the background section has not provided sufficient background information.\n2. Regarding errors stated in the paper:\n    1. \u201cLack of Convergence: Models\u201d: Why should models be trained to their maximum test set accuracy? You don't have access to the test set during training!\n    2. \u201cData Leakage: Training\u201d: The authors of the original work stated this in their paper in Figure 3 that there is a close match of memorized points in the test set.\n    3. \"Sub-population Shift\": The argument does not necessarily contradict the previous work because it aligns with what they have been arguing in their paper: memorization is necessary due to the long-tail distribution. Both mislabeled and sub-population data points are part of the long tail; therefore. It does not necessarily mean that the model memorized the points associated with sub-populations. They have high influence scores because they are rare in the data distribution, and the model exhibits a similar behavior of memorization.\n3. There is an argument in the paper that the definition of memorization from the original work is incorrect, but there is no strong justification for this claim, and it is deferred to future research. I would suggest the authors first review their observations and results and then use them to formulate a more robust definition of memorization. In that case, your work would be better supported.\n4. There are many repetitions of information with different formats conveying the same content in the paper, such as in the Introduction, Background, Related work, Discussion, and Conclusion. The presentation format could be significantly improved.\n5. The \"Data Leakage\" in the Background section is not sufficiently well explained. I have read the \"Do CIFAR-10 classifiers generalize to CIFAR-10?\" paper, and the context provided in your paper is what they have already explained, and it can be moved to the appendix.\n6. Table 1: It is not necessary to provide a table for symbols in the main pages; it can be moved to the appendix.\n7. A large portion of the paper is dedicated to understanding the original paper, and it is defined in a way that favors the introduced issues mentioned at the beginning of your paper. It can be shortened, and the detailed discussion can be left in the appendix.\n8. Section 5.1 (SETUP): You should check what your models memorize with the modifications you have made, not just the 1015 memorized points provided by the original authors.\n9. The implementation of fixes is not provided along with the submission."

The authors of the reviewed work identify three core issues that they believe led to overstated results in the original study: lack of model convergence, data leakage, and subpopulation shift. They address these issues by implementing weight decay for better model convergence, removing near-duplicates from datasets, and conducting a subpopulation analysis to preserve unique subpopulation examples. Their findings suggest that by addressing these factors, the impact of memorization on accuracy is significantly less than previously reported, reducing the loss in accuracy due to memorization by a factor of five."

The critique regarding subpopulation shifts questions the validity of ignoring the central hypothesis of Feldman and Zhang's work, which emphasized the importance of memorizing near-singleton subpopulations. In particular, when you put examples from small subpopulations back into the original training set in order to allow for the test set examples from the same subpopulation to perform well, that defeats the entire purpose of the original paper where they claim that because some test set subpopulations have only one or two members in the training set, therefore they need to be memorized to perform well. So the results on the subpopulation shift are unfounded in my opinion, but I do agree with the results on model convergence and data leakage particularly, but I do not think that the effect is as prominent as the original claim of the paper. \n2. The paper fails to replicate a key analysis from Feldman and Zhang's work, specifically the varied levels of model accuracy against memorization thresholds, limiting the robustness of the current findings.  I think that this work needs to do a proper analysis to replicate figure 2 of the paper by Feldman and Zhang where they have various levels of model accuracy with respect to memorization value threshold on ImageNet CIFAR-100 and MNIST datasets, and they show that removing random examples is better than removing memorized examples. In my opinion, this is a critical figure and a critical analysis that the authors need to present, whereas at this point, the authors have only presented results at one single point, which does not account for a solid justification that a prior method does not succeed.\n3. There is a concern about the fair comparison due to the reduction of examples used in the training set without adequately accounting for this change in the experimental setup. (See Questions)"
