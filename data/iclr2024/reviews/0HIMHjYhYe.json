                "value": "The proposed approach aims to first model p(s, a) pairs that is it trains a generative model to predict both the state as well as the actions. This is definitely less than ideal for high dimensional state inputs such as images. Second it is unclear how well this diffusion model will work for multi-task policies or even policies in the same environments but where state inputs can have wide distributions. The examples being considered in the paper only focus on very simple toy envs (cheetah, walker) or objects with a single target object (cube for robot manipulation).\n\n**Results:** For the complexity of the proposed approach the environments used for evaluation are relatively toy. Moreover, the proposed approach does not even show any significant gains compared to existing approaches. This is especially true considering that BC policies probably have very few parameters while the used diffusion models will have much larger number of parameters and a more complex training strategy. \n\n**Novelty and related work:** The paper proposes to model (s, a) pairs using a diffusion model. However, for deterministic environments (all mujoco envs considered here), this is similar to modelling (s, a, s\u2019) pairs. Howevever, many prior works focus on modeling both the transition dynamics (s, a, s\u2019) and the policy together. Infact, one of the original papers (Janner et al.), which proposed using diffusion model for control tasks motivated diffusion models with a very similar motivation. Specifically, Janner et al. learn both the transition dynamics as well as the underlying policy of the task. Unfortunately, Janner et al. paper is neither cited nor discussed. One difference between Janner et al. and the current paper is that the current paper is only predicing per state (s, a) pairs instead of an entire trajectory. However, I don\u2019t see that as a huge difference, infact I think modeling the temporal dynamics with diffusion models is probably the right thing to do (instead of per-trajectory options \u2014 this is what diffusion policy (Chi et al.) also does). The current paper is light on specific details, but it seems the current model only uses 1-step (s, a) for training diffusion model instead of trajectories (maybe the authors can correct me if I am wrong). \n\n**Distillation:** The paper can also be considered from a distillation perspective where a diffusion model is learned and then distilled into an MLP policy using the trajectories generated by it. Maybe works that consider distillation with diffusion models should also be considered. Further, some recent work in multi-agent control (MADiff) with diffusion model also has a similar perspective where a diffusion model is used as a generative model to generate data for training. Maybe these works should also be cited.\n\nMeng et al. On Distillation of Guided Diffusion Models\n\nZhu et al. MADiff: Offline Multi-agent Learning with Diffusion Models\n\nOverall, I am unclear if there is anything new that a reader is learning from this paper. The main idea of the paper has been shown previously in slightly different setting but in a much more broader context."

For instance, the authors mention that \u201c[IBC] (Florence et al., 2022) propose to model the joint probability p(s,a) of expert state-action pairs using an energy-based model,\u201d which is not ture. While the energy function formulation in IBC takes both state and action as input, it models a conditional distribution over the action space and not a joint distribution. \n2) I also think that learning the conditional and joint distributions separately introduces redundancy to the model, which is not addressed in the paper.\n3) Explanation for the choice of baselines (Section 5.2) seems very undermotivated.
