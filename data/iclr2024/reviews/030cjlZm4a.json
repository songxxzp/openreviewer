                "value": "**Major**\n\n1 \u2013 Most how the points I would like to raise concern interpretability. (See also the points in the Question section on that matter.)\n\n1.1 - Interpretability is directly impacted by the complexity of the model itself, but the fact that the algorithm is in itself a black box makes it such that understanding why the model is what it is is unreachable.\n\n1.2 \u2013 As discussed in [1], p.17, when it comes to logical rules, the more digits there are to take into account, the less the rule is interpretable. One could argue that the checks from Figure 4 aren\u2019t that interpretable. When it comes to the features themselves: what does it really mean to have an \u00ab\u00a0sd\u00a0\u00bb of FiO2 above 0.035? It is normal? Is it higher than the average? Is it higher than a certain minimum threshold? Such questions arrises with every check.\n\n1.3 \u2013 The interpretation made of the checks from MNIST Images task is questionable. It\u2019s been known for a long time now that saliency maps, especially the vanilla approach of looking at the gradient map, can easily lead to false conclusions, especially when those conclusions match what a person is seeking [2]. Interpretability is needed in the context where explainability (e.g. saliency maps) is not trustworthy.\n\n1.4 \u2013 Finally, the interpretation of the features is made in an example where the relationship between the inputs of a problem and the labels is known. The procedure given in order to make sense of the feature extract wouldn\u2019t work if this knowledge was unknown.\n\n2.1 \u2013 It is shown that the use of the fairness regularizer works in order to minimize both FNR and FPR, but it is not discussed whether or not the constraint impacts the performances of the checklist, so there is no way to truly understand if its usage is really beneficial.\n\n2.2 \u2013 The second contribution states \u00ab\u00a0We investigate the impact of different schemes for improving the interpretability of the concepts learnt as the basis of the checklist. We employ regularization techniques to encourage the concepts to be distinct, so they can span the entire input vector and be specialized, i.e. ignore the noise in the signal and learn sparse representations. We also investigate the impact of incorporating fairness constraints into our architecture.\u00a0\u00bb But since (as discussed in 2.1) there lacks evidence of the soundness of the fairness regularizer, combined with the fact that there is no evidence demonstrating that \u00ab\u00a0regularization techniques encourage the concepts to be distinct, so they can span the entire input vector and be specialized\u00a0\u00bb (as discussed in 1.4), or at least that the \u00ab\u00a0different schemes for improving the interpretability of the concepts learned\u00a0\u00bb truly are responsible for such observations, the soundness of all Contribution 2 can be questioned.\n\n[1]\u00a0: Rudin, C., Chen, C., Chen, Z., Huang, H., Semenova, L., & Zhong, C.

                "value": "1 - Interpretability is not inherent to a family of models. For example, a checklist whose features aren\u2019t interpretable or a checklist with too many \u00ab\u00a0checks\u00a0\u00bb to look at (as with linear models) isn\u2019t interpretable either, for the simple knowledge is drowned in the quantity of information to manipulate. Therefore: how is it made sure that the model, concerning those two criteria, remains interpretable?\n\n2 \u2013 It is argued that decision trees could be of lesser interest when it comes to medical applications. But, the interpretation of a model is part of how the features interact with each other in order to generate a given response. When it comes to checklists, no interaction is presented whatsoever; in the case of decision trees, it is inherent what features need to be looked at carefully given the value of some other feature. Wouldn\u2019t that be more appropriate in the context of medical tasks?\n\n3 \u2013 It has been briefly discussed that there is an exponential memory complexity intrinsic to the model. Was that a limitation to the experiments that have been run?  \n\n4 - How did it impact the training time? Was that training time similar to the compared approaches? How many hyperpameters are there in total, and when compared to the baselines?"

Model comparison in Table 1 would be better to also be illustrated in graph and plots for easy visualization.\n3. Concepts learned from images seem not human-interpretable if looking at the example in Figure 3. The two concepts might still look like visual patterns that could be only differentiable by machines or algorithms. It will be hard in practice to create human-understandable checklist out of the concepts illustrated, especially in clinical domain. \n4. Concepts learned from other data modality is not illustrated in the main paper, especially time series and text, which weakens the claim of interpretation utility of the proposed algorithm in different modality.\n5.

Checklists are a type of interpretable models that are widely used in clinical settings. A checklist model consists of a set of concepts, each of which is assigned an integer weight (always +1 in this paper). The prediction is made by summing the weights of the concepts that are present in the input and comparing the sum to a threshold $T$. Existing methods for learning checklist models are limited to tabular data. To learn checklists from these raw data modalities, the authors propose to train neural networks using a probabilistic logic programming (PLP) framework. Basically, the neural network maps the input signals to a fixed number of logits, each of which is regarded as the log probability of the presence of a concept. One can then use the logits to compute the likelihood of the positive/negative label based on the definition of the checklist model. The likelihood of the positive label is the probability of the event that at least $T$ concepts are present in the input. The model is then trained with the cross-entropy loss. The authors also propose to add several regularization terms to encourage interpretability and fairness. In the experiments, the proposed model is compared to integer programming and deep learning baselines."
