As I understand it, you are learning simply a return-action conditioned density model over states, which could be represented by any network (including e.g. an MLP or a CNN for a suitably encoded state $s$). On the other hand, transformers shine especially for sequence modeling - but as far as I understand the work, you are only modeling individual states, not sequences of states? Please correct me if I misunderstood this.\n\n### On the loss\n\nYou claim that if the state model is tabular, the two losses are equivalent. While I'm not sure which two losses you mean, I don't see how it would be equivalent to either of them. Could you please expand on your explanation?"

I would strongly suggest to shorten introduction and basics, and add discussions to support such statements, either formal or at least through toy examples with reasonable explanations. \n\n- The chess player agents using supervised learning are still quite important benchmarks to compare against (the authors named them in the second last paragraph of the related work section). Indeed, this is the only way to prove RL is a requirement and rebuttal recent voices that supervised learning reins supreme. Once you learn the value function, its corresponding updated policy (greedy or Boltzmann) can be compared against such agents. Or at the very least, their Elo scores can be compared."

It then follows that all such information is also irrelevant to $\\xi(s|a,z)$ as well (as it is part of $Q$). Why?? \n\n- Then, in the Pretraining paragraph, the authors say: training $\\hat{\\xi}(s|a,z)$ is related to $\\hat{\\xi}(s)$ (which is what I expected in the first place).

                "value": "* The paper feels like a proof-of-concept:\n\t* The proposed method does not conclusively answer the question asked in the paper (about the Value Function Hypothesis).\n\t* The proposed method does not beat a baseline (a superiority of discriminative methods was observed).\n* Section 3\n\t* The paragraph \"connecting value function to the logarithmic loss\" is unclear. \n\t\t* The promised connection is not very transparent.\n\t\t* A statement claiming that a set of augmented states converges to a stationary distribution is confusing (it seems like a \"type mismatch\" problem).\n\t* Section 3, paragraph \"discriminative and generative decompositions\" \n\t\t* The decomposition approach is confusing\n\t\t\t* The main components are $\\xi(s|a,z)$ and $\\xi(z|a)$. Both are rather unorthodox when it comes to RL: the former requires the knowledge of future returns ($z$), and the latter gives the distribution over returns only given an action (without knowledge of the state $s$).\n\t\t\t* How are such objects used for inference? A pseudo-code could improve the clarity here.\n\t\t* Discussion following eq 3 is unclear (e.g., why is $\\hat{\\xi}(s|a,z)$ good and $\\hat{\\xi}(z|s,a)$ bad?)\n\t\t* There should be an assumption that $|\\mathcal Z|<\\infty$.\n* Experiments:\n\t* Section 5.1:\n\t\t* The evaluation protocol is confusing:\n\t\t\t* Is the computation of ELO metric and early stopping rule described in the \"main result\" standard? Is there a citation that one can refer to?\n\t\t\t* In the last sentence of paragraph \"dataset\", it is written that models are evaluated on ~24K boards. Where is it reflected in the paper (Table 1 says about 800 games, roughly 50 for each pair of agents, or computing metrics on 28K boards)\n\t\t* Table 1 implies that the generative approach has ELO roughly smaller than 100 when compared to the discriminative approach.  According to the table's caption, the latter is twice as likely to win. This seems to conflict with the statement that \"the two main decompositions are close in performance\".\n\t\t* The results of the ablation part are not very informative (what is the main conclusion? are the conclusions for smaller models also valid for larger ones?). It seems more like content for the Appendix.\n\t* Section 5.2 (gridworlds). \n\t\t* Experiments do not seem very informative, showing that it is impossible to discriminate between the methods significantly.\n\t\t* The (online) training protocol could be better explained (e.g., in the form of a pseudo-code).\n\t\t* It is curious that using a constant uniform return model does not impact the learning dynamics. It would be interesting to see the results in similar environments where this is not the case.\n\t* Other:\n\t\t* The paper often first describes what did not work and then what was done. For example, eq (3) or the second paragraph in Section 4 \"return-action conditioning\". While the information about what did not work is very valuable in machine learning, it could be gathered in a separate place and could possibly be put in the Appendix."
