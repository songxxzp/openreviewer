The main result is that memorization increases linearly with the number of heads, monotonically with the context size, and monotonically with the head dimension as long as it is smaller than the context size. The result validates some of the common practical choices of hyperparameters. The authors verify their data assumptions empirically by checking for linear independence of context vectors and approximately testing the Kruskal Rank. They also present a synthetic experiment that confirms their theoretical findings."

In a common understanding, attention plays a role to capture knowledge from the context according to the \"attention\" on other tokens for each token.  So what does attention memorize? I think the paper should make it clearer before or after the theorectical analysis, or even verify the memorized knowledge with some visualization. \n2. Analysis and comparison with existing works are insufficient, for example,  <<Transformer Feed-Forward Layers Are Key-Value Memories>>. How are the memories different between this paper and the reference? There are also some works about transformer   interpretability and model editing. Do the observations in these related works support the findings in this paper? I think the authors should give more analysis, rather than demonstrating the their propsed theorem only."

The study aims to understand how effectively these mechanisms can remember example sequences, depending on the number of attention heads and the lengths of the sequences. The research introduces new assumptions about the linear independence of input data, which differ from previous models, and under these conditions, it's shown that an attention layer with a certain number of heads and parameters can memorize a proportional number of examples. The paper further discusses how different attention heads process different sequences and how the softmax function contributes to this capability. These theoretical findings are supported by experimental results using synthetic data."
