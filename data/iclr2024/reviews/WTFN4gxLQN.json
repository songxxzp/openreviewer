Specifically, the authors randomly generate MAE masks and calculate two trigger scores based on image structural similarity and label prediction consistency between test images and MAE restorations, respectively. The authors also exploit trigger topology to refine them further. After that, the authors will use their average to refine the poisoned testing sample. The authors evaluate their methods on CIFAR, VGGFace, and ImageNet dataset under 4 baseline defenses."

To the best of my knowledge, most of the existing advanced backdoor attacks (e.g., WaNet and ISSBA) are with full-image-size triggers instead of local ones. However, the proposed defense can only remove local triggers. As such, its application is limited. Of course, I note that the authors explicitly state this in their limitations chapter, which is to be encouraged.\n2. For me, the technical contributions are minor to some extent. Given we only consider local triggers, the main pipeline (without topology refinement) is straightforward. This part didn't enlighten me in any new way.\n3. As for the topology refinement (Section 4.3), the authors should explicitly mention that there are many existing backdoor defenses (e.g., [1-2]) having a similar idea. The authors should also state the similarities and differences between their method and existing ones in the appendix.\n4. I think there are many hyper-parameters involved in this paper, although the authors did not explicitly mention it. For example, those values in first two paragraphs (page 6) and in the second paragraph (Section 4.4). The authors should also discuss their effects.\n5. Please provide more justifications of the last paragraph in Section 4.2. \n6. Please provide more justifications of the last two sentences in Discussion and Limitation (page 9).\n7. The ASR after defense is still high (e.g., >10%) in many cases. \n\n\nReferences\n1. Trigger Hunting with a Topological Prior for Trojan Detection.\n2.

I think it is strange and can the authors provide a reason?\n3. The number of model architectures and attack methods being tested is clearly below the ICLR acceptance threshold. All the experiments are conducted on ResNet against only 4 attacks.\n4. Model repairing-based backdoor defense should be compared.
