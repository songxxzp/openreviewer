This paper does not consider these factors.\n- The pruning and quantization are usually implemented serially in practice. However, the proposed method considers them separately and then merges them together using a simple criterion. \n- The quantization and pruning methods tested in this paper are out-of-date. Also, other compression categories like low-rank matrix and tensor decomposition are not considered.\n- According to Fig. 7, the proposed method does not work well on large-scale datasets.\n- This paper does not compare with SOTA compression methods (published after 2021) that are directly used to compress models on unseen datasets.\n- The training cost is still very high, i.e., 8 days. I don't think the proposed framework can save time a lot as compared to existing SOTA compression methods."

I find that the overall presentation of the work can be somewhat challenging to follow. For instance, in the description of the inner loop of the meta-learning process in Figure 2a, there appears to be a discrepancy where Metadata extraction lacks information from the compressed classifier, which contradicts the description in the main context.\n\n3. The title suggests that the focus of the work is on \"learning to compress DNN\" implying the main objective is to compress various models with different compression methods using a meta-learner. However, the paper is more like \"learning to choose compression methods of DNN\" and predominantly centers on training a compression accuracy predictor to predict performance. It then recommends specific compression methods based on different requirements. This deviation from the title's apparent focus may appear inconsistent or confusing to readers."

Could you please offer further elaboration on the \"META FEATURES\"? Additional details about the specific features used would be beneficial for a clearer understanding."
