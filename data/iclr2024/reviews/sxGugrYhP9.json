Battery dataset are heterogenous in both their measurement techniques and data formats.\n2. Feature extraction is difficult when applying ML techniques to battery data.\n3. Adapting modern ML models to battery data cannot be done in a plug and play fashion.\n\nTo address these problems, the authors provide an open source platform called BatteryML which unifies datasets, provides tools for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, prediction and visualization. They also define the primary battery degradation prediction metrics including State of Charge (SOC), State of Health (SOH), and Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Finally, they evaluate multiple models (linear, neural nets, and random forests) on the task of predicting RUL separately on 7 different datasets as well as combinations of these datasets. They present test RMSE on the RUL prediction task and plots of different battery degradation metrics such as battery capacity vs number of charge cycles."

The reason this is important is to enable the development of models that actively support/engage with physical phenomena in the correct fashion (physically plausible explanations).\n- There seems to be a mismatch between the keywords used in Figure 1 (Normalization) and subsequent descriptions, which use Data Preprocessing. \n- SOC seems to be used prior to being explicitly defined (1st occurrence in Pg. 2, Contributions while definition is in Section 3.3)"
