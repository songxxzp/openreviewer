                "value": "1. Unrealistic problem setting on the agents' incentives. The authors assume that the agents quit the FL process as long as they are \\epsilon close to optimal solution. In ADA-GD, the agents are simply ignored when they are sufficiently close to the \\epsilon-optimal set and are kept waiting in the system. This is highly unrealistic, if the faster agents know the server will implement ADA-GD, then the very first time they are ignored, why don't they early quit and run another round of local gradient update? The assumption that the agents are only first-order strategic is not a good enough assumption, there should be more careful design on the backward induction steps, and I think we need a much more sophisticated algorithm than ADA-GD to make sure strategic agents are happy (incentive compatible and individually rational) to participate in the algorithm given they have realistic outside options (like training the final gradient step themselves). \n2. Unrealistic assumptions on the server's information availability. In ADA-GD, the server can observe the agents' losses instead of just their gradients is not realistic.\n3. In sufficient discussion on the field of FL, strategic learning and insufficient comparisons with related works, I suggest the authors provide a table that list out the (1) type of strategic manipulations of related works in FL, as well as the (2) assumptions those paper make, and (3) convergence as well as robustness guarantees. Moreover, I'm very suspicious about the claim on page 4 \"if there is no shared minima for all agents, applying FL is not reasonable\". First of all, this is not known prior to participating in the FL process for all agents. Secondly, I suggest the authors discuss related works in personalized FL and further explain this claim here.\n4. Very restrictive settings like \"strong convexity, smoothness, realizability, and minimal heterogeneity\" makes the algorithm unable to run on deep learning tasks like vision and NLP.\n5. Unclear why the server wants to find a solution in W^*, as long as the agents are all \\epsilon happy, all participants should be fine with the outcome."

Most applications of federated learning are carried out with a larger number of local updates, $K>1$.\n3. The performance of ADA-GD is not comparable with local SGD using uniform aggregation. Figure 7(a) reveals that local SGD achieves higher accuracy and lower error before the defection happens.
