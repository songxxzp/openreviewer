However when you must train a model on a downstream task it could be that all the features that were learned on the source task are not necessary. So, if one had a way to select which features are relevant, then one could reduce the number of features needed to solve the downstream task and thus deploy smaller models. To address this task, they propose to  impose an L2 regularization which forces to find the most relevant features for the downstream task among all the features of the pre-trained models."

This makes the proposed method a simple variant in the feature-based knowledge distillation framework and thus lack novelty.  \n\n2 Some related works are missing in this paper, including those improving standard transfer learning and those considering transfer learning from multiple pre-trained models. For example, [2] also proposes to match pre-trained features and downstream features during transfer learning. [3] and [4] also consider transfer learning from multiple pre-trained models and propose to use features or knowledge distillation from pre-trained models. More related works in these two topics should be discussed in the paper. In experiments, some of these more advanced transfer learning methods should be compared, instead of only comparing AFT with standard transfer learning or knowledge distillation.\n\n3 Some issues in the experiments. \n\n(1) It seems that in this paper, the pre-trained models are stronger than downstream models. Figures 2(c) and 3(c) also show that transfer learning by directly using pre-trained models leads to better results than AFT. This makes the problem setting in the experiments less convincing, especially considering that the linear probe from pre-trained models is also efficient.\n \n(2) It is good to see experiments from vision, language, and multi-modal tasks, but in each task, only a few datasets are evaluated, and most of them seem to be easy.\n \n(3) Transfer learning from multiple models is interesting, but currently, the number of models in the experiments is still small, and the improvements by using more pre-trained models are not clear from the results.\n\n[1] Knowledge Distillation: A Survey. 2021\n\n[2] Delta: Deep learning transfer using feature map with attention for convolutional networks.

The paper is positioned as a generic method that could be applied to any set of models (possibly containing architectures different to the downstream one). However, while the presented theory to justify the method is sound and generic, the empirical results do not seem to support the claim. For example, in Figure 1 (right) and Figure 2 (b) adding convolutional features to a ViT based downstream model seem to reduce the performance of the model. Why is it the case? To me it seems to suggest that the proposed method is not strong enough to reject some features that will lead to a worse downstream model. \n    - If this is the case the current algorithm should be coupled with model selection techniques to pick the best features that are more likely to help (see [1] and reference therein). Can the authors comment on this more?\n2. The previous limitation gets even worse when the set of conditioning models gets larger since the signal to noise ratio drops, making extracting the relevant information for the downstream task even harder. I suggest the authors to consider comparing with explicit sparsity inducing methods as the ones proposed in [2] and the references therein.\n3. The final algorithm is optimizing theta and rho jointly. However, one would expect \\rho being optimized more often than \\theta. Typically, this is done with bi-level optimization techniques or simple rewriting \\rho in closed form for each given \\theta. Did the authors try those more natural alternatives? If \\rho is not optimized fast enough the most likely trajectory induced by SGD will be around a stationary point of \\rho which leads to a maximally insensitive/uninformative \\rho which will be reasonably good on average for many possible \\theta, however not optimal for any in particular. \n\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] A.

This will make the optimization space much smoother (e.g. by choosing a Gaussian kernel).\n3. Visual evaluation on CIFAR100 is quite limited, to increase the impact of the paper on the community I suggest the authors to extend the evaluation to other datasets as the ones used in [1]. \n\nMinor:\n- Some typos and grammatical errors are present in the paper, please proofread the manuscript.\n- Can you report in the paper the level of sparsity of the rho projection map? This could help the reader understanding what happens when irrelevant pre-trained models are added to the mix.  \n- Make the scatter plots with learn probe accuracy vs test accuracy on the same scale.
