PROSE is entirely based on Transformers and the attention mechanism and draws inspiration from the pioneering line of work on operator learning for differential equations. \n\nThe experiments, performed on 15 multi-dimensional ODE systems, show that the model efficiently leverages information from both the numerical and symbolic domains and predicts accurate solutions both at the numerical and the symbolic levels."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- My main concern is that the claims about the ability of PROSE to perform model discovery are not sufficiently backed by empirical evidence. The number of considered ODEs is limited to 15 and as such, I do not see the necessity of having a symbolic decoder predicting the full mathematical expression. Alternatively, one could have resorted to a simple classification network responsible for predicting one out of 15 classes corresponding to the underlying ODE. The coefficient of the predicted ODE could have then been optimized via, for example, BFGS. In other words, I feel that the hypothesis space considered in the paper is too small, as the number of possible expressions to be predicted is limited to 15.\n\n- Another source of concern is that the model is trained on fixed grids, i.e. training solutions are provided up to 2 seconds. It would be interesting to see how the performance of the model changes as the size of the training window changes. \n\n- I think a more complete analysis should have been performed for the case when input symbolic information is wrong or corrupted by noise. Is the symbolic decoder able to correct the wrong information provided by the symbolic encoder?\n\n- In terms of novelty, while I understand that fusing symbolic and numerical information can help in the prediction of the solution at future time steps, when symbolic information is not available (which is rather common), the model reduces to a relatively simple forecasting approach, whose novelty is quite limited. What would make the approach more novel is the symbolic decoder part, which in the considered setting of only 15 equations, cannot do much more than predicting one of the 15 examples seen at training time.\n\n- Some relevant related works are not mentioned. In particular [1,2] also use Transformer to predict velocity fields at the symbolic level.\n\n- The model is not compared with relevant baselines, e.g. SINDy or DeepOnet, or the aforementioned works.\n\n\n[1] Becker, S., Klein, M., Neitz, A., Parascandolo, G., & Kilbertus, N.

The system equations, which be fully known, known up to their pre-factors or known up to a few random terms, are represented as trees, enumerated in Polish notation, and encoded by a 4-layer transformer. The output of both encoders are then mixed together by a 8-layer transformer.\n\nTwo decoders (both 8-layer transformers) operate on the encoded inputs: one to predict future values of the trajectories from their time coordinates, and one (auto-regressive) to predict the system equation. \n\nExperiments on 15 dynamical systems, with parameters sampled in a small range around a value of interest, show that the model can indeed predict trajectories and actual model parameters with good accuracy, and that the model can extrapolate away from the equation parameters seen at train time."

                "value": "The methodology must be better justified. The overall architecture is fairly complex, and many technical choices and not justified, or validated by ablation studies. Some important information, like the training loss, is missing. \n\nThe training and test sets are too small and not diverse enough. All train and test examples are generated from only 15 systems, with a very small number of free parameters (4/15 have 1 free parameter, 3/15 have 2 and 4/15 have 3). Those parameters are  sampled in a small interval (0.9,1.1) around their value of interest, to generate a training sample of 512k examples -- i.e. 34,000 examples per system. There is a large risk that the training and test equations will significantly overlap, or at least be very similar. What guarantees do you have that your results are not due to train/test contamination?\n\nThe experiments are the weak part of the paper. Appendix B states that the model was run for 80 epochs of 2000 optimisation steps, on batches of 2*256=512 examples. Overall, this means 81.9 million training examples, or 160 passes on the 512k training set. Given the size of the model (several hundred million parameters), and the lack of diversity in the train set (34k examples per system on average), there is a large risk that the model memorize its training data. This might account for some of the results. \n\nFinally, a comparison with baseline results, notably prior work on symbolic regression(see for instance, https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12617), would help assess put the results in perspective. In their current form, the benefits of this approach are difficult to evaluate.\n\nOverall, this paper is interesting and the model shows promise but stronger experimental evidence, and especially a larger and more diverse training set, are needed to validate its results."

                "value": "* related works: previous works on symbolic regression should be mentioned, notably Becker et al. (ICML 2023, https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12617), and probably D'Ascoli et al., Biggio and Kamienny et al.\n* Polish notation: in language models, it was introduced by Lample & Charton in 2019, but the technique is much older (logicians in the 1930s, and computer scientists in the 1950s)\n* \"there is a one-to-one correspondence between trees and mathematical expressions\" this is incorrect: expressions like x-2.1 can be encoded as + x -2.1 or - x 2.1, and x+y+z as + +x y z or + x + y z. Besides, unless simplification is used when the data is prepared, many equivalent expressions result in different trees (2+x <=> x+2 <=> 1+x+1).\n* the 3-token encoding for floating point numbers was introduced in Charton 2022. Lample et al. only use integer pre-factors.\n* \"our vocabulary is also of order $10^4$ words.\" What precision do you use? Charton 2022 uses 3 significant digits, for a vocabulary size of about 1100 words (901 mantissas, 200 exponents, 2 signs). D'Ascoli 2023 uses 4, for a vocabulary a little below $10^4$.\n* Figure 2: the term self-attention layer used in the figure is misleading: these are self-attention+FFN layers, with most of the trainable parameters in the FFN. Maybe use transformer layer instead, or transformer encoder and transformer decoder to indicate the presence of the cross-attention mechanism.\n* feature fusion: an 8-layer transformer seems like a very large model to learn to align the numeric and symbolic representations learned up-front. Have you tried smaller fusion networks (one or two layers, perhaps just self-attention and a single linear layer as the output?)\n* since the symbolic output can have variable length, many authors propose to compress it as a single, high dimensional vector, using attention distillation (Santos 2016), or simpler techniques like max-pool. Have you tried such techniques?\n* what is the training loss? how do you balance between the two decoders, are they trained simultaneously, or separately?\n* could you provide results as a function of system dimension, and number of free parameters? \n* could other metrics be presented? (D'Ascoli uses $L^\\infty$, Charton $L^1$)\n* Table 4, seems to be on the Unknown 3D experiments, please add this to the caption.\n* in table 2, a study of how error increases with the extrapolation interval would be interesting: from data sampled on (0,2) what is the error on (2,4), (4,6), (6,8)?"
