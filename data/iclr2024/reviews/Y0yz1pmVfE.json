I think there could be an interesting contribution here, but the quality of writing needs to be improved before publication. \n\nFrom what I can tell, the experimental results seem strong, but my ability to understand the significance of the results is essentially limited to seeing that CA-GPL's line is higher than GPL's.\n\n\nNitpicks/minor errors (not affecting score):\n* I think $\\mathcal A_{\\mathcal N}$ and $\\Theta_{\\mathcal N}$ should have an $\\exists$ quantifier in their definitions, not a $\\forall$---otherwise, they're both empty sets, since there is not a joint action that is simultaneously in $\\mathcal A_{\\mathcal N_t}$ for all ${\\mathcal N_t}$.\n* In the formulation in Sec 2.2, it is unclear how the team $\\mathcal N_t$ evolves with time.

Is that correct? In any case this should be formally stated.\n2. It seems like the paper is adopting a single-agent perspective, where there is a single learner $i \\in \\mathcal N$ and all other agents' policies are held fixed (is this correct?). But then how can we optimize social welfare, required by Theorem 1, if we only control the single learner $i$? In particular, what if the other agents are acting in such a way that learner $i$ alone cannot achieve social welfare optimality?\n1. At the beginning of Sec 3.3, I don't understand the point of defining $\\mathcal{CS}_t$ only to later set $\\mathcal{CS}_t := \\mathcal N_t$. Does this have a purpose? It seems cleaner to just not define the extra symbol.\n1. In section \"Representation of Preference Q-Values\", there is a clause beginning \"which is presumed ... goal\". What does \"which\" refer to here? Is this an assumption required by Theorem 2? If so it should be formalized mathematically.\n1. What's the purpose of the types? They don't seem to be doing anything, except perhaps affecting transitions---but my interpretation of Theorem 1 implies that we only need to perform local optimizations at each state anyway. Perhaps it would be cleaner---and just as interesting---to write the paper without types?"

                "value": "The paper studies the problem of ad-hoc teamwork from a novel, cooperative game-theory perspective. Specifically, the paper considers conditions on the optimization of the single learner (in ad-hoc teamwork, a single learner is trained to collaborate with different teammates which she has never met before) so that the grand coalition, i.e., the coalition in which all teammates collaborate for the common goal, is stable and preferred by all agents. Importantly, this allows for an approach with variable number of teammates in every round that is not addressed by previous methods. The paper further uses a, possibly time-varying, star graph to model the interactions of the players with the learner in the centre and the non-interacting teammates in the leaves.\n\nThe main contribution of the paper is that it proves that the solution concept describing the stability of ad hoc teams, roughly the core of the cooperative game described above, is reached when the agents maximize the social welfare, i.e., the sum of agents\u2019 preference Q-values as the global Q-value. Based on this, the paper extends the Graph-based Policy Learning (GPL) algorithm to the coalition-affinity GPL (CA-GPL). CA-GPL is then experimentally evaluated in the Level-Based Foraging (LBF) and Wolfpack environments. The experiments suggest consistent improvements over GPL and also dilligently highlight the importance of each assumption used in the theoretical results. For instance, variations of the main model that relax sufficient (not necessary) conditions show similar performance to the optimal model sheding light into possibilities for further research."

This is not explained in the text.\n- Can you please highlight the main theorem that addresses the motivating question at the bottom of page and top of page 2? I admit that I got lost in some parts of the theoretical presentation. \n- An algorithm environment for CA-GPL would have aided the reader to appeciate the novelties over GPL.\n- If I am not mistaken, the notation seems too complicated and redundant. For instance, if I understand correctly, it holds that v_j(C) = w_ji  = R_j and later on R_j = \\alpha_j + (other terms). Similarly for the social welfare that is defined as sum (of sums) of such terms. Thus, I had difficulty to follow the proofs. Is my concern valid?\n- More examples for complicated notation: \n    - what is $|-i|$? Is it the cardinality of the set of all agents other than $i$? If yes, then first, this is never explained, and second why not simply write $N_t-1$?\n    - what is $b_j$ in the bottom of page 2? Is this used later on?\n    - what is $a_{t,j}$ below equation (1)? Should this be $a_{t,-i}$?\n    - social welfare is used in Theorem 1, but it has not been defined before.\n- It seems to me that the definition of the joint policy $\\pi_{t,-i} :\\mathcal{S}\\times \\Theta_N \\to \\Delta(\\mathcal{A}_N)$ allows for _correlated_ policies. However, this contradicts the assumption that permeats the text, that teammates don't interact at all with each other. Is this concern valid?\n- Theorem 1 is hard to parse for me. If the grand coalition is strict core stable (with respect to what valuations?), then what does it mean to show that it is strict core stable? Apologies if my confusion is not justified.\n- Regarding the experiments: In Table 1, we see that the stability metric worsens for CA-GPL in both scenarios as training progresses (especially for the 4 teammates). Why is this? Also, in the figures, we see that the curves keep increasing (they have not converged). Is this a valid concern? And would it make sense to provide larger frames?\n\nThere are many typos or difficult to understand sentences. I name a few below:\n- page 2: \"we translate the achievement .... decision making\". incomprehensible\n- p2: the stability, of ad hoc teams (misplaced comma)\n- p2: LBF -> please name it properly the first time that this is used.\n- p3: \"if a coalition structure ... weakly blocking coalition\". incomprehensible\n- p3: \"There exist an affinity graph\" -> exists\n- p3: continually (you may want to check if continuously is better here)\n- p5: we aims at -> aim\n- p8: \"the relationship among ad hoc teammates is weak to\" -> shouldn't it be the opposite here, i.e., strong relationship?\n- p9: \"theoretical model Our theoretical model\" -> typo?\n- p16: \"...results in that prices ...\" (in Theorem 1) -> incomprehensible.\n- there are more, please check."

                "value": "This work investigates the ad hoc teamwork (AHT) problem. The work introduces coalitional affinity game (CAG) and its Bayesian variant to characterize the AHT problem with open teams. The work further designs the solution concept and an algorithm to tackle the problem. The work mainly compares its performance with graph-based policy learning (GPL). The work even provides an external link to show some gifs about their experimental results."

            "strengths": {
                "value": "1. This work combines open SBG and CAG to propose open-SB-CA-G. This combination seems natural. The work demonstrates that open CAG is well compatible with CAG.\n2. The work subsequently formulate the problem of finding the optimal stationary policy into reinforcement learning. This cast is very natural and it obtains a variant of the Bellman optimality equation.\n3. The work provides some lemmas and a significant amount of experimental results."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Considering that the idea of combining open SBG and CAG is quite natural, and so does the RL formulation, the contribution of the work will concentrate on its practical performance. The amount of testing environments seems a bit lacking, and the difference of the outperformance seems marginal."
