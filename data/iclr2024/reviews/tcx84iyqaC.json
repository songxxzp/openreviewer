But one thing I believe can largely improve the paper is that we can further evaluate the quality of the reward model by best-of-n policy. Specifically, we can fix a LLM, and for each prompt, we sample n responses and then take the one with the highest reward as the final output. Then, we can compare the responses by either human evaluation or GPT4 evaluation. For more details, you may check [1].\n\n------------------------------------\nUpdate in 11.11\nSorry for the late update. I just read the paper again and have a quick question about the choice of U. As I mentioned in the above review, the experiments conducted are rather limited and simple. In particular, the utility function used for the response length seems to be hard to generalize to general practical applications. Could you give an example of the choice of utility function in practice, e.g., used for the HH-RLHF dataset (whose details can be found in huggingface). \n\n[1] let's verify step by step"
