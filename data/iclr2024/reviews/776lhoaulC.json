                "value": "The study addresses nighttime optical flow, hampered by low texture and high noise. Traditional methods employ domain adaptation from auxiliary to nighttime domains but struggle due to domain gaps. To overcome this, the study introduces a common-latent space, using daytime and event domains. It shows motion appearance knowledge can be transferred effectively in reflectance-aligned spaces, and theoretical derivations emphasize substantial correlations between spatiotemporal gradients. Appearance and boundary adaptation are complementary and effectively transfer global motion and local boundary knowledge to nighttime domains, as validated by extensive experiments."

They are complementary and sound reasonable for the performance improvement."

The authors explore a common latent space as an intermediate bridge to reinforce feature alignment between auxiliary and nighttime domains. They construct two common spaces: a reflectance-aligned common space between daytime and nighttime domains, and a spatiotemporal gradient-aligned common space between nighttime frame and accumulated events. The appearance adaptation transfers global motion knowledge from daytime to nighttime domain, while the boundary adaptation transfers local motion boundary knowledge from event to nighttime domain. The proposed method, ABDA-Flow, achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime optical flow."
