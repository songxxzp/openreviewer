By evaluating SSL representations without labeled tasks, improvements in hyperparameter selection and algorithm development are facilitated.\n\n2) Utilizing Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to assess the dimensionality collapse of SSL representations is both theoretically grounded and considerably novel. While RankMe assessed SSL methods via the effective rank of the covariance matrix (related to PCA), LiDAR focuses on the rank of the scatter-ratio matrix through LDA.\n\n3) Detailed experiments highlight a significant and consistent positive correlation (measured by Spearman and Kendall coefficients) between LiDAR and linear probing performance on the same source-target datasets, surpassing RankMe across most settings."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) The manuscript lacks evaluation on out-of-distribution (OOD) target datasets. Although the ImageNet dataset results are promising, the evidence for LiDAR's effectiveness in more realistic downstream tasks, often involving OOD datasets, is missing. Comparing with datasets like iNaturalist-2018 or Stanford Cars, following the protocol in RankMe, would strengthen LiDAR's position as a useful proxy metric.\n\n2) LiDAR introduces two hyperparameters: the number of surrogate classes (n) and the number of samples per class (q). Yet, the manuscript does not provide guidance on determining these values. Given that these values differ across methods, a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis seems essential.\n\n3) The comparative analysis appears limited, with LiDAR mainly being evaluated against RankMe. Other potential baselines, like $\\alpha$-ReQ mentioned in related work, are overlooked.\n\n4) In Section 4.1, the authors advocate for dimensionality reduction (DR) of embedding features, possibly adding another layer of dependency for LiDAR evaluation. The necessity of DR for LiDAR's effective application, and any specific DR algorithms used in experiments, remain ambiguous.\n\n5) Although the authors claim LiDAR integrates the SSL objective, the manuscript does not delve into the relationship between LiDAR and different SSL losses."

                "value": "1) Scatter matrices, $\\Sigma_w$ and $\\Sigma_b$, having dimensions ( p $\\times$ p ), are influenced by both n and the data dimensionality (p). In Section 4.1, the authors note they \"maintain a total of 50 features\" for VICreg. How does this align with rank constraints dictated by the data dimensionality?\n\n2) What guidance can be provided for practitioners to select appropriate values for the number of surrogate classes (n) and the number of samples per class (q)?\n\n3) The authors re-implemented RankMe (without data augmentation) for new architectures, namely I-JEPA and data2vec, using 10k images for rank estimation. This contrasts with the originally suggested 25.6k images. Meanwhile, LiDAR employs at least 50k total samples. What motivated this choice?\n\nThe rebuttal addressed the raised issues well. Therefore, I updated the review."
