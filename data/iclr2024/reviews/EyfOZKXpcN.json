                "value": "This paper addresses factualness in QA systems. The idea of REFEED is as follow: 1) generate an output, 2) use retrieve relevant information from large document collections. 3) Integrate the latter into the prompt and refine the answer. The pipeline is plug-and-play and does not require any fine-tuning. The overall approach is more efficient and cost-effective than human feedback.\n\nMore in depths, REFEED generates multiple diverse outputs. For each, REFEED uses retrieval conditioned on the input and output instead of the input only, which makes it different than standard RAG approaches. The retriever (e.g., BM25) identifies the top-k relevant documents and remove duplicates. During refinement, the retrieved documents are integrated into the prompt along the outputs. However, there is a likelihood that the retrieved documents are misaligned with the output. The authors circumvent this problem by taking the average language modeling probability to rank the generated outputs before and after incorporating the retrieved documents. Then by comparing the different, the authors pick the first or refined output.\n\nThe experiments are based on single-hop QA, TriviaQA, multi-hop QA, and WoW. The models used are davinci-002 and davinci-003. The baselines are fair. The performance in the zero/few-shot experiments are convincing. The ablation study highlights the necessity of the multiple-output generation and the ensemble proposed to identify whether a refined output is better. Finally, the authors show how their approach can be integrated into chain-of-prompt and even improved the results.\n\nOverall, this is a good paper, well written and structured. The idea, while simple, is novel. My only concern would be whether the proposed approach would work for other models than davinci-002/3 (see also related question regarding the calibration). I would ask the authors to experiment with one or two others LLMs (e.g., T5)."
