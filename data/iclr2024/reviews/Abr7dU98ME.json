By building upon and improving the forward-forward algorithm (FF), ForwardGNN is designed to work with graph data and GNNs without generating negative inputs. This results in a more efficient training and inference process. The framework also enables each layer to learn from both bottom-up and top-down signals without relying on backpropagation. Experiments conducted on five real-world datasets and three representative GNNs demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the forward graph learning framework, showing that it outperforms or performs on par with BP while using less memory for training."

A more extensive literature review is necessary to differentiate the present paper. Additionally, the paper's contribution could be strengthened by including experiments for comparison with [2].\n\n2. The data splitting differs significantly from those in previous papers. I recommend that the authors conduct experiments using standard splitting for semi-supervised node classification tasks.\n\n3. In Figure 2, the upper-left corner is crowded with too many methods, making it difficult to read. Presenting the results in a table might be a better approach (the table should be much simpler compared to Table 2 and Table 3).\n\n4. In Algorithms 1-4, the authors state \"optimize layer using the computed loss\" but the details of the optimizer are not clear, e.g., what optimizer is used.\n\n5. In addition to memory, training time is an important metric. Including the training time of the proposed method and baselines will complete the picture.\n\n6. In Table 2, why does SF-Top-To-Loss achieve state-of-the-art performance with one layer, but the performance degrades with more layers? An explanation is needed.\n\n7. In Table 2, the best-performing method varies significantly across datasets. Providing an intuition for this variation would be beneficial.\n\n8. In Table 3, the memory of some proposed methods is higher than BP (even 20 times higher in Table 3 (c) GAT). Would this be a significant bottleneck?\n\n[1] Belilovsky E, Eickenberg M, Oyallon E.

Hence, many nodes (depending on the graph scale) will be connected to the same virtual node forming a bottleneck. This approach seem to be very prone to the issue of over-squashing [1,2].

I suggest finding a stronger motivation in the introduction, such as what the problem FF wants to solve on graph learning.\n2. By training layer by layer, FF can be seen as a time-for-space algorithm. In the experiment, authors only show the limited space utilization without mentioning the overhead training time. I think it is inappropriate.\n3. In the node classification task, authors randomly selected 64% for training, which is not the common practice in graph learning. In most cases, we only select a small percentage for training, as in the GCN, GAT, and SAGE paper author mentioned.
