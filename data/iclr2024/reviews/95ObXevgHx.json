A model is trained to predict high-frequency power across electrodes at moments before and after onset of each word from the contextual embedding at each of 48 layers of GPT2-XL.  A 200 ms window was slid across the four seconds adjacent to the presentation of each word; given the rate of speech this interval overlaps with an irregular number of adjacent words.  For words that were rated as predictable by GPT2-XL, the time point at which the model was most predictive changed systematically across layers by about 200 ms. Similar results were observed for other regions believed to be important in language processing, but not in mTSG.  Results for words that were not well predicted by the language model were much less consistent."

However, as it was discovered, spatially the alignment is not that clear, it's not like you can track which brain area corresponds to which \"layer\" of an LLM.\n\nIn this paper the authors argue that the desired alignment can be tracked, but through time, not through space. They use ECoG recordings that provide them with the ability to track neural signal through time, while the previous studies, those that claimed there is no great alignment, could not do that because they were using fMRI recordings that have very poor temporal resolution in comparison to ECoG.\n\nIn the rest of the document authors show how the best-correlating layers seem to show a distinctive pattern: early LM layers best predict brain activity at early times, mid LM layers - brain activity at mid times and late LM layers - brain activity at later times. This very much seems to confirm the hypothesis that as the representation of a word evolves thought the layers of a DLM, it matches to representations found in the brain in the later timestamps, perhaps because a word evolves in some regards similarly in out brain.\n\nThis highlights an important funding that differently from visual processing, language computation in the brain is temporally hierarchical and is localised in the same area, bringing forward the potential important of recurrent computation for this function."

Before we we ask if we can reconstruct those representations it would be nice to know that they actually carry information about the words and are not just unrelated neural processes. Without this, from Reconstruction : Embeddings -> Signal we know that we can reconstruct and capture the temporal dynamics in the brain signal, but this does not necessarily mean that this dynamics is relevant to language processing (I understand that the area where the signal is from is a language area, but who knows what else it might be doing that is contributing to the signal we are so diligently are trying to reconstruct).\n\n(2) What happens with not-so-much-predictable words?

In my mind (in)ability to do this would be informative in terms of whether the recorded activity actually contains strong enough signal to claim that it carries any bits of language representation in the brain.\n\n(2) What is the canonic path of a word through the brain? Which areas are being activated in which order according to the modern day knowledge on this? The reader would benefit of a figure explaining this, same as we've seen in all the vision papers.\n\n(3) Are there differences between spoken words and written words? Do their brain-paths converge at some point? Where? Do we believe that representations are different depending on whether a word was perceived auditorily and visually? If semantic representation is what we are after, should we only compare representations \"after\" this point of convergence once the word took its abstract semantic representation form that is divorced the \"mechanics\" of delivery?\n\n(4) How did you handle multiple subjects: were their data put into one large pot, or each subject was treated separately (by training subject-specific models)?\n\n(5) Figure 2: How would the whole lag-layer-correlation picture look like if you would shuffle the words that are being decoded? I am trying to understand if this picture we are seeing is indeed due to language structure and representational similarities between brains and DLMs, and whether this nice picture would disappear if we carefully and deliberately remove the sought signal from the data?\n\n(6) Figure 2: Also, if we, once again, remove the signal from the data via some sort of permutation test, how all these plots will look like? Some other shape - which one? Just flat - why? The answer to this question will, in turn, lead to a question about why those shapes look like they do in the absence of the true signal.\n\n(7) Figure 2: And one more here: how high the correlation would rise for the data we know should have no correlation? Would it be actually 0 all the way from -4000 to 4000, or because of some general dynamics and the way how to the linear readout models are trained some positive correlation will still be observed? How high?\n\n(8) Could the correlation be explained by, say, non-sparsity of the representation in DLM in the mid layers, or some other technical reason, and not by the actual match between representations?"

These papers typically train a regressor model (typically a linear regressor) to predict the fMRI measurements from the neural language models' representations. Current linguistic encoding models on analyzing deep language model representations have shown that these models learn rich linguistic knowledge within their representations. The work done in neuroscience has shown alignment between language models with layer hierarchy and high-level language brain regions for both fMRI and MEG recordings. They then evaluate predictive power by measuring the correlation between predictions and actual measurements.\n\nThis paper contributes to that literature by showing evidence that the layered hierarchy of deep language models (DLM) may be used to model the temporal dynamics of language comprehension in the brain with the help of electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings. Further, the authors demonstrate a strong correlation between DLM layer depth and the time at which it is most predictive of the human brain."

                "value": "In this paper, the authors explore the relationship between the hierarchical structure of Deep Language Models (DLMs) like GPT2-XL and the temporal processing of language in the human brain. The authors use electrocorticography (ECoG) to record neural activity from participants listening to a narrative, while also feeding the same narrative to GPT2-XL. Contextual embeddings from the different layers of the DLM are extracted and used to predict neural activity in the brain. The experiment results suggest that the sequential layer processing in DLMs mirrors the timing of neural activity in human brain language areas."
