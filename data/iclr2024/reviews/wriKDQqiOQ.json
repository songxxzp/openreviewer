The paper proposes two tricks to improve the existing methods, i.e., large batch size and normalized momentum. The authors provide theoretical arguments to show the benefits of large batch size (variance reduction) and prove the convergence of normalized momentum trick. Empirical experiments show that the combination of these two tricks outperforms existing start-of-the-art methods."

The use of large batch size also significantly boosts the test accuracy under ALIE attack and FoE attack except for KR and CM for the FoE attack cases. \n3. The combination of large batch size and normalized momentum achieves the best empirical performance in nearly every case. \n4. The use of large batch size significantly reduce the wall-clock running time for training fixed number of epochs."

In addition, this work only considers i.i.d. cases, which is kind of restrictive if not enough theoretical improvements are obtained.\n2. The variance reduction trick using large batch size is a direct consequence of (Karimireddy et al., 2021)), so it is hard to claim that this is one of the main contributions of the current work. Furthermore, the optimization of B is conducted on the upper bounds of the convergence rates, so it does not necessarily leads to faster convergence if we set optimal B. This probably should be made clear in the paper. \n3. The technical elements in proving the convergence of ByzSGDnm are closely related to references such as (Cutkosky & Mehta, 2020), so I am not clear whether there are substantial contributions therein."

In proposition 2, equation (5), why the last term has a $\\sigma^2$ term, while in the work (Cutkosky & Mehta, 2020), this term is only in $\\sigma$. Can you briefly explain why? \n3. Can you explain why KR fails all cases? Is that because KR does not satisfy the definition 1? \n4. Why does CM have degraded performance in table 4 after increasing batch size, this batch size should be right based on its performance in ByzSGDnm, can you provide some comments on that? \n5. In the comparison with Byz-VR-MARINA, why do you use $512\\times 8$ batch size for ByzSGDnm, but never uses that for Byz-VR-MARINA?"
