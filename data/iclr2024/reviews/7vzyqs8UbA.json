This paper focuses on the case when there is the effect of metric autocorrelation in data, which means the variance of feature vectors is positively correlated to their temporal/spatial distances.\n\nModelling: The authors propose a metric-constrained model-based model that leverages the correlation between adjacent estimated models and their locations in metric space. They use Gaussian Markov Random Fields to model inter-observation dependency and use Wasserstein-2 distance to measure the distance between estimated model parameters. Because of the metric autocorrelation, they use a metric penalty that decreases as distance increases.\n\nKey results: From the experimental results, their algorithm appears to be computationally more efficient than other methods and has better performance in terms of ARI and NMI."

Same problem for the fourth contribution. It would be better to at least have a complexity analysis for your algorithm to say that your algorithm solves the problem efficiently with \u201csolid theoretical proofs\u201d.\n3. I think the authors need to justify the use of GMRF in the model since they are fitting a GMRF for each sample. It would make more sense to fit one GMRF for one cluster as different data clusters will naturally have different variable dependency structures.\n4. One of the advantages of the proposed method they can deal with arbitrary dimensions of constraint space instead of just 1-D and 2-D. Did you try it with a 3-D dataset?\n\nMinor comments:\n1. In section 5.1, the authors claim that the proposed method has only three hyperparameters to tune. What about the tuning parameter for Graphical Lasso?"

Only an overview of clustering performance is provided. Ablation studies of the design choices are lacking, so these claims are not well-supported. Comparisons with strong baselines are also lacking.\n\n------\n\n## Post-rebuttal\n\nDear authors, I greatly appreciate the detailed clarification. Some of my concerns are cleared.\n\nRegarding A1 & A2, the major contribution is minimizing the number of failed goodness-of-fit tests rather than optimizing the total data likelihood according to General Response Q1, which seems novel. However, the components are still taken as-is despite being well-crafted as explained in General Response Q2, so my original comment still holds.\n\nRegarding A4, I don't work in your area so I can't suggest stronger baselines. But from a general perspective, TICC was published in 2017 hence doesn't look new. STICC was published in a geoscience journal rather than ML/DL journals/conferences, and it has been cited only 7 times as of now, that's why I had the question.\n\nOverall, I raised my rating to 5."
