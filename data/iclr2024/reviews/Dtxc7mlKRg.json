The notation of the paper is slightly confusing. For example, you use $r_f(X, Y)$ at the beginning of Section 4.2, where $X, Y$ are datasets. However, earlier, you use $r_f(X_{n+1}, y)$ correspond to a specific datapoint $X_{n+1}, y$. Which is it? Moreover, one uses $\\epsilon_y$ to denote the top-k error but $\\epsilon_{n_y}$ to denote a general constant. Using $\\epsilon$ for a general constant definition is not a great practice, in my opinion, and greatly complicates the reading.\n3. The computation of $\\hat{k}(y)$ that achieves sufficiently small $\\epsilon_{y}$ seems very difficult. Indeed, the equation provided to calculate this calibrated class value seems very computationally expensive to find. Moreover, it seems that the quality of the generated sets is highly dependent on $g$. I believe two additional explorations should be included in this work. The first is an ablation oon how different values of $g$ affect the generated length of the sets. If the prediction sets' quality is only strong for different $g$, which vary greatly between different hyperparameters, then doing a hyperparameter search for different $g$ for every individual dataset is very expensive. Comparing a method for which the hyperparameters have been extensively tuned to another algorithm for which this is not the case is not a fair empirical comparison. Moreover, a detailed section on the computability of the calibrated class is in order. It seems that you need to do a linear search over the calibrated dataset many times, which is far more expensive than traditional Split Conformal Prediction. A breakdown here would be nice. \n4. The assumption in Theorem 2, i.e., equation 10, is a very strong assumption. More proper detail should go into detailing when this assumption holds and how. It seems to me that the heavy lifting of the proof of this theorem is done by this strong assumption. It is not clear to me when this assumption should hold. \n5.  I am surprised there is only one baseline for CCP. I believe a vast array of methods for CCP should be compared. This could include the methods from (\"Class-Conditional Conformal Prediction With Many Classes\", \"Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage\", \"Improving Conditional Coverage via Orthogonal\nQuantile Regression\", \"A Gentle Introduction to Conformal Prediction and Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification\"). There is a vast array of CCP works, and comparing to the most basic method is insufficient, in my opinion."

Do existing conditional coverage methods such as those mentioned in \"A Gentle Introduction to Conformal Prediction and\nDistribution-free uncertainty Quantification\" achieves suboptimal set length compared to this weaker notion of conditional coverage.\n2. If the nominated coverage $\\tilde{\\alpha}$ is larger than $\\alpha$, then why are the generated sets shorter? This is not immediately clear to me. Is it because this allows for the use of only the top-k classes, which shortens the intervals? \n3. In the experiments, how were the hyperparameters chosen? I don't see where values such as $g$ were chosen. Were the hyperparameters for the baselines chosen in a similar manner to that of the proposed method?\n4. Do existing works guarantee that their method of CCP outperforms the naive CCP method in terms of the size of the prediction set, or is this unique to this work?"

                "value": "**Significance**\n\n\u201cOur proposed k-CCP algorithm (summarized in Algorithm 2) avoids scanning all class labels y \u2208 Y by leveraging good properties of the given classifier f in terms of its top-k accuracy.\u201d One of the advantages of conformal guarantees is that they do not depend on the classifier used to compute the prediction sets. Assumptions on the classifier make the method no longer applicable as a post-hoc procedure working with a black-box ML model. In addition,  in realistic scenarios it  may be hard to make valid assumptions on the top-k  accuracy of the classifier. Moreover, if a classifier is trained using an imbalanced dataset, one should expect the accuracy of the classifier to be higher for majority classes, which does not necessarily guarantee good performance on the top-$k$ accuracy.\n\nThe computation of $\\hat{k}$ depends on the hyper parameter $g$. One would expect that tuning such a hyper parameter would add a data and computation overhead. The authors do not elaborate on this overhead neither on the process of selecting  the hyper parameter as well as the implications that this process can have. Furthermore, it is not clear if the proposed $\\hat{k}$ will never be such that it violates the target coverage $1-\\alpha$. A definition of $\\hat{k}$ in theorem 1 as well as guarantees that the error terms in theorem 1 are small or can be small with high probability for that $\\hat{k}$  could strengthen the contribution.\n\nThe results of theorem 2 strongly depend on the assumption (10). This assumption seems to depend on the probability distributions that may be hard to safely evaluate and verify in practice without a significant data overhead. It would be very useful to provide insights, or data efficient method with which one could check if (10) is satisfied.\n\n**Novelty**\n\nIf the paper was the first attempt towards class conditional coverage, a failure analysis for the standard split conformal prediction algorithm, would make perhaps more sense. However, given that there are already other algorithms to address class conditional coverage, showing that MCP does not necessarily provide class-conditional guarantees does not seem as a strong motivation  for the current work.  Existing prior work [2] has already provide evidence that MCP does not satisfy class conditional guarantees. Besides MCP was never designed or claimed to achieve class conditional coverage.  \n\nGiven that in the experimental results k-CPP and CPP seem to perform very similarly in terms of conditional coverage, it seems that the main advantage of k-CPP is the reduced set size. However, there is no comparison with CPP using the RAPS method [1] that improves over APS. It would be also important to investigate (theoretically and/or experimentally) how the proposed method compares to other approaches with conditional guarantees such as [3], or other approaches to improve the size of the prediction sets [4]. Were there results on how the proposed approach advances over such works, would make the contribution much stronger.\n\n**Presentation/clarity**\n\nThe entire manuscript gives the reader the impression that it was written in a rush as, typos, grammatical errors and poor sentence structure appear very frequently.  These make the work cumbersome to read. Moreover, there seems to be quite some room fro improvement in terms of clarity, flow and cohesion. For example:\n*   In the abstract it is very unclear what the authors mean by \u201cinflated coverage and calibrated rank thresholds\u201d\n*   In the introduction in the 3rd paragraph in the middle  \u201cTo answer the main research question,\u201d  should follow right after the main research question for a nice flow\n*   In the last paragraph before contributions the way the authors are presenting the differences is quite confusing. Instead of stating the methods followed by CCP and then listing the methods of k-CCP, it would have been clearer to compare the two approaches point by point.   \n*  The three bullets in the contribution are hard to read. They lack of proper sentence structure, especially the lack of any articles make the reader struggling to follow. They look more like incomplete notes, than proper text.\n*  The definition of the top-k error for a class $c$ is confusing. $\\epsilon_c$ seems to depend both on the constants $c$ and $k$. Perhaps using $\\epsilon_{c}^{k}$ could make the definition clearer. \n*  In page 5, in the definition of the top-k error it the random variable $Z$ is not defined. Also, in the same paragraph it is not clear what is the distinction between $\\hat{k}(y)$ and $k(y)$. Also $\\hat{k}(y)$ is not formally defined the first time that it is introduced, which is confusing.\n*  It is not clear why $\\sigma_{y}$ is necessary in (10), as the denominator cancels out. One could directly state the condition in (10) using just the nominator of $\\sigma_{y}$.\n\nIn the experimental evaluation, in table 1 the results for the Food-101 datasets on the UCR are not highlighted for CPP method wherever it achieves the lowest UCR among the baselines.  \n \nThe under coverage indicator in the Under Coverage Ratio  assumes a fixed calibration set. However, conformal coverage guarantees on $1 - \\alpha$ are in expectation over the calibration set and the test sample. As a result the UCR definition appears incorrect. \n\n**Typos/Misc**\n\n1.
