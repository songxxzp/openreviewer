Only sentences that lie within a valid region of the feature space can be sampled during generation. Concurrently, they introduce a stronger paraphrasing scheme by generating sentences with minimal bigram overlap compared to the original. Experiments demonstrate that SemStamp exhibits greater robustness against both the baseline and the proposed paraphrase attacks than the baseline watermark."

This could pose issues when there are multiple keys/users, as there might be a need for correction during detection, such as the Bonferroni correction. Reliable detection requires the method to yield a notably low p-value. It would be beneficial if the authors could present some plots between the number of sentences and the z-scores/p-values.\n- As the authors acknowledge, SemStamp demands significantly more generation time than preceding watermarks."

I am wondering how robust SemStamp is to some other unseen datasets.\n- In practice, I think False Positive Rate = 5% sounds not pretty practical, could the authors show some numbers when the False Positive Rate is lower, like 1%?"

                "value": "The paper proposes a watermarking for large language models. The idea behind the method is to watermark a semantic meaning instead of just words, as the prior art does. The watermark is embedded in transformed key-dependent domain, which is a classic trick in watermarking (see for example [1]). The embedding by rejection sampling is a novel feature, though the rejection sampler can have very poor efficiency and allows to embed very small watermark. While the text is not specific about the length of the watermark, I believe it is to  be equal to the number of LSH projections, which is equal to two in experimental settings (paragraph about speed on page 8). This means that the rejection sampler have high success to embed, but the watermarking scheme can suffer from a high false positive rate. This does not seem to be true, since the AUC seems to be high. I would welcome this to be better clarified.\n\nThe major problem of the watermarking scheme is that the effect of watermarking is \"big\". Since the watermark is hidden in the semantic domain, it effectively prevents generating answers with some semantic meaning. This gives the watermark robustness against paraphrasing, but in my opinion the degradation is so severe that the scheme will be useless in practice. This is visible in Figure 5, where the watermarked text is less useful then the non-watermarked.\n\nOverall, I like the idea to hide the watermark in the transformed domain, this brings the work closer to methods used to watermark digital images. But the execution in the text domains is more difficult than shown in the presented text.\n\nI would welcome if authors acknowledge of existence watermarking techniques predating large-language model boom, which exist and are apparently forgotten [2,3].\n\n[1] Bas, Patrick, and Fran\u00e7ois Cayre. \"Natural watermarking: a secure spread spectrum technique for woa.\" International Workshop on Information Hiding.

I think this renders the scheme useless.\n* The length of the watermaking seems to be small. Since the watermark is hidden by rejection sampler, the length of the watermark has to be sufficiently small to make the rejection sampler efficient, which at the same time makes the false positive rate high. Notice that practical watermarking scheme should have false positive rates in order 10^-5 or 10^-6, because most of text is watermarked. You should report detection accuracy at this rate. FPrate 5% means the user will be constantly flooded with false alarms. Again, this is inherent weakness of the scheme, which renders it practically useless."
