                "value": "This paper presents a risk estimation methods that can categorize regression prediction failure into four groups, including ID, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, and High Risk. The paper starts with demonstrating the weakness of epistemic uncertainty based method and show that it is insufficient to evaluate predictive risk when there is Out-of-Support in the modelling. With such motivation, the paper presents its method based on anchoring  predictive model. The transformation of inputs is able to construct a connection between training data points with test data point such that OOS / OOD data could be flagged out through carefully defined functions. In experiments, the paper includes synthetic benchmark function as well as real regression datasets to show the effect of the proposed method. Baselines are those epistemic uncertainty based solutions. Evaluation metrics are somewhat not standard, which is probably introduced by this paper itself. Thus, I cannot tell if the experimental result is indeed trustworthy."

While uncertainty estimation based solution has been there for a long time, there were less contribution made in this field that is not based on uncertainty estimation. This makes the paper stand out as a novel contribution.\n2. The paper is fairly well written with sufficient evidence to support its claim. While some concepts may be a bit hypothetical (I mean not really possible to distinguish between OOD OOS in practice), the motivation and solution are well connected."

I realized the novelty majorly comes from the nature of the anchoring predictive model, which makes me concerning the contribution this particular paper (as it is more incremental now). In addition, how does people use this method to measure regression risk if they don't use anchoring model (which more likely happen in real world)?\n2. Multiple concepts introduced in this paper are hypothetical and may not be possible to know in practice. E.g. OOS / OOD are hard to distinguish.\n3. The evaluation metric introduced in this paper is hard to be convincing in terms of the setting with 20 percentile or 90 percentile in the False Positive and $C_{low}$. Why? What makes the authors to choose those numbers. Is that the real reason of better performance compared with existing solutions?\n \nMinors: \nType: Section 3.3, False Negative (FP) should be False Positive."
