                "value": "Unfortunately, this paper tries to do too much and too little at the same time.\n1. As a paper introducing a new library, there is insufficient details of the design and implementation of the library. It also has insufficient comparison with existing libraries - what sets it apart from existing work? \n\n    a. Table 1 does not really make sense -- the header for column 1 is \"Model\", all the comparisons are different models, but ProbTS is not a model. It would make more sense to compare ProbTS with other libraries/packages (e.g. GluonTS, TSLib, etc.) rather than specific models/papers.\n\n    b. More attributes for libraries should be compared -- metrics, datasets, data transformations, data loading efficiency, ...\n\n    c. More library comparisons should be added [1, 2, 3], and many others.\n\n    d. The characterization of GluonTS as \"each specializing in a single forecasting paradigm, fall short of our research objective to unify the two distinct research branches\" is not accurate -- new architectures can and have been implemented in it. Also see how it has been used in [4]. \n\n2. As a benchmark paper, it fails to perform a comprehensive evaluation in both dimensions of architecture design and probabilistic forecasting head. \n\n    a. In Table 4, only a small number of methods from each dimension has been evaluated on. \n\n    b. A more comprehensive evaluation, combining different architectures with different probabilistic forecasting heads can be presented.\n\n3. As a an empirical study, it does not yield any definitive insights into the interplay between architecture design and probabilistic forecasting head.\n\n    a. More insights regarding various architecture designs should be given -- e.g. for architectures like Autoformer -- how can be attach probabilistic heads, since the architecture design outputs the prediction based on seasonality + trend? What about PatchTST, how does patching affect probabilistic heads?\n\nNote that I am not saying the paper should achieve everything mentioned above, but one particular direction should be chosen to go all in.\n\n[1] https://github.com/unit8co/darts\n\n[2] https://github.com/salesforce/Merlion\n\n[3] https://github.com/facebookresearch/Kats\n\n[4] https://github.com/kashif/pytorch-transformer-ts"

The paper highlights key insights from the toolkit's analysis, revealing that long-term forecasting scenarios often exhibit strong trending and seasonality patterns, while short-term scenarios have more complex data distributions. It also identifies the strengths and weaknesses of different methodological focuses, showing that probabilistic forecasting excels in modeling data distributions, but may produce poor point forecasts. Additionally, the autoregressive decoding scheme is effective in cases with strong seasonality but struggles with pronounced trending, while the non-autoregressive scheme is preferred for long-term forecasting. The paper concludes by emphasizing the potential of combining these research branches to revolutionize time-series forecasting and anticipates that ProbTS will catalyze groundbreaking research in the field."

These factors can significantly impact forecasting performance, and a deeper exploration of their effects would have been highly informative.\n\nMoreover, the insights presented in the paper could have been more rigorously developed and supported. The use of synthetic datasets and controlled experiments could have strengthened the empirical evidence, particularly since the datasets used in the analysis exhibit diverse characteristics that might confound the results.\n\nLastly, a minor point of improvement lies in the Contributions section of the Introduction, where the term CRPS is mentioned before its definition. Providing a definition before using the abbreviation would enhance the clarity of the paper."

The lack of good functioning naive/statistical models for probabilistic forecasting is actually a significant gap in the modern deep learning literature. Could you please include a few methods from this area as baselines in the proposed framework?\n- The benchmark contains many datasets, however key datasets that have been instrumental in designing some of the current architectures are missing. Can you include M4, M5, TOURISM?\n- Most datasets included in the benchmark are small-scale. For the purpose of studying model scaling and ability to model complex distributions, it feels urgent that large scale time series datasets are included in modern benchmarks. In this context, I can think of FRED from https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02887"

How do you deal with the licenses of original datasets?\n- I included a number of questions and concerns and will be very happy to revise my score accordingly if all of them are addressed meticulously."
