                "value": "- The core justifications of the approach doesn\u2019t hold track, or at least are not well justified. The use of Pareto-based multiobjective optimization usually implies objectives that are contradictory, here the objectives aim at similar goals, although they may not be perfectly aligned. The need for such MO is not clear to me.\n- The justification of gradient-free optimization is not clear. These optimization approaches are much weaker and would require more computation to achieve strong results than gradient-based optimization. We currently have a model and losses from which we can get derivatives, I don\u2019t see the issue in using them, the justifications provided are not convincing.\n- The results provided are showing very small improvements regarding the values of PSNR and SSIM (e.g., Fig. 3), even if it looks like a Pareto front, I think the differences obtained are just a slight misalignment between the two metrics, which overall aims at a similar goal. Moreover, at such levels, the differences are not necessarily meaningful, especially for the perceptual losses, which are not to be interpreted to be super precise. The gains provided by the proposed approach looks rather like to me a statistical flukes coming from the fact that we are dealing with population-based optimization, and as such we are able to pick a set of solutions in the population that appears to behave better on our train/validation/test sets (not sure which one was used in Fig. 3), but are in fact within statistical error margins.\n- Looking at Figure 3, with the different images, it is not clear what is what, but overall it is very difficult to figure out anything from the images, they look quite similar and overall not of a very good resolution. Having clearly identified low resolution, high resolution of the patch as well with the one generated with some of the approaches would be helpful. A good example of figures showing well the difference are the on in the paper \u201cA Deep Journey into Super-resolution: A Survey\u201d (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07523.pdf), where differences between the approaches evaluated are obvious (see Figs. 6 and 7 as great examples)."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "I think the greatest issues of the paper lies in its motivations. The fact we should use Pareto MO is really not clear neither well justified. The natural reflex is to combine several objectives in the optimization loss with some weighting (something in the form L = f + \\lambda g, where \\lambda is the weight for the tradeoff between f and g objectives in the loss)  seems the way to go at first. The paper proposes to use something similar, but the adjustment of the \\lambda appears not proper to me, the scale of the two measures are quite different, and various scales of \\lambda need to be tested. Moreover, the use of Pareto MO usually comes from the fact that the objectives at hand working in some sort of opposition, improving one value should lead to a decrease of the others, and some on. I don\u2019t think this is the case in the current case, as the losses are mostly aiming for the same goal, with measurements on different aspects and a slightly different misalignment, but nothing strong. It makes much more sense to combine them than to optimize them as opposed objectives.\n\nAlso, the use of evolutionary algorithms is justified only by the fact that population-based optimization is compatible with Pareto MO, where we are dealing with a set of non-dominated solutions, rather than just the single current best solution (as we usually have with gradient-based optimization). But as soon as we are challenging the notion of making use of Pareto MO, the need for evolutionary algorithm vs gradient-descent does not hold. In brief, the need for Pareto MO in the current context should be made in a more convincing manner.\n\nThe results reported show small gains over the objectives values. Moreover, the methodology to pick the best solution for Pareto MO optimization is not clear. How the solutions reported in Tables 3 and 4 picked? Are they chosen from the Pareto set (non-dominated solutions) according to their test performances (pick the best on test), or on some other training or validation set? Because picking them on the same dataset that the one used to report the results is not fair, as we will pick one that may be \u201cby chance\u201d performing well, given there should be some random variability observed with these measures, compared to the single solutions provided by the gradient approach. That should be explained further to insure that the gains observed with the proposed approach are not just statistical flukes."
