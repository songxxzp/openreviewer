            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There are three major weaknesses of the paper.\n\nFirst, the writing of the paper is not very clear. For example, the majority of the paper describes how we can use MIB to segment trajectories, but there is no description of how this MIB-derived segmentation is actually used in training the policy network. I believe this part should be at least briefly described in the paper. (I found it in the supplementary material, but I would like to mention that reviewers are not subject to reading the full supplementary material).\n\nSecond, while I found the introduced metric novel and interesting, I did not fully get its intuition. In particular, is it just the case that the speed of the robot arm will be very low when it's close to a \"key state?\" Because the uncertainty is essentially defined as s_t | s_{t-dt}.\n\nThird, since the contribution of the paper lies in segmenting trajectories (the policy part is directly following CoTPC, based on the supplementary description), there is little comparison between the segmentation method and other related approaches, such as\n\n- Skill Induction and Planning with Latent Language https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01517\n- Learning from Trajectories via Subgoal Discovery https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6f518c31f6baa365f55c38d11cc349d1-Paper.pdf\n- CompILE: Compositional Imitation Learning and Execution https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01483\n- Identifying useful subgoals in reinforcement learning by local graph partitioning https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1102351.1102454\n\namong many, many others. The authors should discuss, and compare with these algorithms.\n\nAlso, it seems that the proposed method has the limitation that each key state can only be visited once in a demonstration trajectory (due to the Chronological assumption). Therefore, it can't model task descriptions that require loops (e.g., scoop all sugar, possibly multiple rounds, to transfer them from one bowl into another bowl)."
