Figure 5 showcases results from evaluations on VIMABench. However, the baseline VIMA-200 performs slightly better than the suggested approach across all tasks. Although the authors argue that VIMA requires large-scale pre-training, their proposed method also depends on large-scale pre-trained foundation models, such as SAM. It would be beneficial for the authors to demonstrate performance gains on tasks where VIMA has not been trained. Furthermore, the performance gain of 3% over PerAct and 1% over CaP in Table 1, is also not significant. \n\n3. Although employing cursor clicks to create point prompts and guide SAM\u2019s segmentation is clever, applying this approach for the Pick and Place task seems unnecessary. If you have the camera extrinsics, you can easily obtain the 3D location of the click by projecting from the image space to the 3D space, given the depth or known height. In this case, there's no need for SAM. In fact, other example tasks should be selected to better highlight the advantages of the proposed method.\n\n\n[1] Brohan, A., Brown, N., Carbajal, J., Chebotar, Y., Chen, X., Choromanski, K., ... & Zitkovich, B.

The authors write \"Unlike existing methods such as CaP (Liang et al., 2022), which directly generates policy codes, our approach generates decision-making actions that can help reduce the error rate when performing complex tasks.\" But, the proposed methodology also uses LLMs to generate Python programs, so the distinction is unclear. Furthermore, about CaP, the authors write: \"However, its capabilities are limited to what the perception APIs can provide, and it struggles with interpreting longer and more complex commands due to the high precision requirements of the code.\" This seems to be a limitation of the proposed methodology as well, which also relies on a finite number of available APIs. Hence, again, the distinction between the proposed methodology and CaP is unclear.\n    - Why is the oracle version of the proposed method used when comparing to CaP, instead of the non-oracle method? This seems to be an unfair comparison.\n    - Even then, the performance gap seems trivial. Is there any evidence to suggest that the gap in performance is non-trivial?\n  - PerAct\n    - The authors write: \"For simple 3D tasks, such as stacking objects, we introduced an additional parameter to indicate the current occupancy. For more complex tasks, such as opening a drawer, we added some heuristic movements to ease the execution.\" PerAct was able to operate without such simplifying assumptions, which makes this comparison unfair. \n    - Even then, the performance gap is very small. How do we know this is a non-trivial gap in performance? Is there a trend of tasks / cases where the proposed methodology succeeds and PerAct fails? What is the intuition behind the proposed methodology outperforming PerAct, which was trained directly for the task at hand? \n  - Decision Transformer\n    - How was comparison to DT done, as DT doesn't take in language instructions?\n    - What is the intuition behind the page gap in performance between the proposed methodology and DT?\n- Simplistic Tasks.\n  - The tasks considered for evaluation seem limited in complexity, e.g. are simply pick-and-place like tasks. These are tasks which can be very easily solved. More complex tasks have not been explored.\n  - Furthermore, as the \"Generated Policy Code\" in Figure 3 depicts, there is an API for pick-and-place, which the system simply calls upon. This simplifies the already simple problem quite a bit, by abstracting away the more difficult low-level control.\n  - Finally, a lot of processing / engineering is done to get the system to work (e.g. applying a gray threshold filter followed by a morphological closing operation, a morphological opening operation, Non-Maximum Suppression, etc.). If all of this engineering was required to get a simple task like pick-and-place to work (which is further simplified with the use of a pick-and-place API), then I find it difficult to see how the proposed methodology could be extended to more complex manipulation tasks, thereby limiting its utility."

Is the LLM simply prompted a second time, with the hope that the output will not contain incomplete or incorrect code?\n- How much prompt engineering went into this when evaluation? Were the prompts the same across tasks, and across methods (ie when comparing to the baselines)?\n- How computationally expensive / slow is the framework? Can the tasks be solved in real-time?"

On the one hand the baselines make use of a large set of training trajectories, but on the other hand these methods train policies that choose low-level actions. The presented method chooses action primitives such as \"PickAndPlace\" but does not need much training data (apart from the examples). I think adapting CaP to the VIMA benchmark would be a more insightful baseline. \n\n- I think it makes sense in the comparison with CaP to compare using an oracle object detector, but one of the main novelties of the work is replacing the perceptual modules of CaP with foundation models. Therefore it would be interesting to see how this affects performance, i.e. just run the method on the CaP benchmark without the oracle.\n\n- Too much detail in related work: I think the related work section is too long and just a list of papers rather than helping to place the work in the research area.
