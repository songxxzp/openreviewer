The derivation to model accuracy in (1) and (2), following [Karimireddy et al., 2022] and moreover, [Mohri et al., 2018] assumes for m i.i.d. samples. Will it enjoy generalization to the non-i.i.d. case? \n2. Some inconsistencies and incompleteness due to unclear representation. For instance, the authors mention generalizing $\\phi_i$ to become a convex and increasing function (but in which variable), and also, in actuality, the utility is modelled as a concave function? Following that, Assumption 2  needs further clarity. Another concern is Fig. 2, which is not well-justified for the said \"payoff function. I don't see this claim has been experimentally validated apart from numerical evaluation.  \n3. How a_\\textrm{opt} is derived/obtained?\n4. If the profit margin of the central server, defined as p_m, is fixed and known by all devices, I am not sure why it is used after all. (in the later experiments, this is used to indicate the degree to which the server is greedy). Assuming this is unknown would be an interesting analysis. Also, the definition of profit margin should be made more rigorous.\n5. As the authors mentioned, it is hard to bond the composition function $\\phi$, and I am still not sure how, particularly with this framework, we can ensure increased data production leads to better payoffs. In principle, one has to factor in the quality of data or limit combinatorial properties.\n6. Evaluations:\n - Indicate the choice of parameters: z_i.\n- Can the authors be more precise on the whole experimental setup? Specifically, how \"more data\" is used in practice? Did I miss something? \n - In its current form, the discussion on device utility is not rigorous, for instance, how it is evaluated. It would be interesting to evaluate per-device performance, apart from the server's utility, as Top-1 accuracy with optimal data contribution and, later, under the influence of accuracy shaping (with RealFM?). Then, can we get the best of both worlds, a high-quality model with improved generalization/personalization performance? Please comment.\n\nMinor suggestion:\nIn the Fig. 1 caption, it should be said, in my understanding, as such that RealFM ensures better utility for a \"truthful\" participation instead."

Theorem 4, which claims that RealFM eliminates the free-rider phenomena, may not be particularly thrilling. Designing a contract to incentivize individuals when their exact contribution is known is not a challenging task.\n4. The comparison between linear RealFM and local training does not effectively demonstrate how well RealFM incentivizes non-linear devices' contribution to model training. It is understandable that the authors cannot be blamed for weak baseline algorithms, as this paper is the first to aim at incentivizing device data contribution in a non-linear setting. However, in such cases, it would be more valuable to have theoretical guarantees of data maximization to truly showcase the strength of RealFM, which the paper lacks, except for the linear setting."

Moreover, it is hard to decide the difficulty of the learning task $k$ and the server would not have access to data for tuning (Sec. 6) before incentivization. As $a$ is an upper bound, the individual rationality for the upper bound does not translate to rationality for the expected/actual values. \n- The advantage of this work over the existing work has to be made clearer. There needs to be a deeper discussion about Shapley value based/collaborative fairness approaches including Xu et. al. (2021) and Wang et. al. (2020). In appendix A, it is suggested that these work \u201cassume that devices are already willing to contribute all of their data\u201d. This claim may be inaccurate \u2014 these work guarantees that contributing less (nothing) leads to less (no) reward thus devices would respond by contributing more data as in this work. The difference is that there is no closed form function for device $i$ utility.\n\n  Wang, T., Rausch, J., Zhang, C., Jia, R., & Song, D. (2020). A principled approach to data valuation for federated learning. Federated Learning: Privacy and Incentive, 153-167. \n- Some notations are used before they are defined or explained (e.g., $[\\mathcal{M}^U(\\cdot)]_i $ in Theorem 2). This makes the claims unclear and harder to understand.\n- The central server has to compute $m_i^o$ and $m_i^*$ based on the declared $\\phi_i$ and $c_i$. Device $i$ may misreport the cost to get a better reward."

Is the amount of data sharing the same as centralised FL? How does the amount of sharing in this work differ?\n2. The Shapley value and collaborative fairness based approaches in existing work may not assume that devices are willing to contribute data. They just guarantee if they are unwilling and contribute less (nothing), they receive less (no) reward. Resultingly, rational devices should contribute more data as in this work. Can you clarify and make the differences/advantages of your work more specific?\n3. What is the implication/significance of Theorem 2? \n4. Does the mechanism _need_ monetary rewards to incentivise devices (can the profit margin be set to 1)?\n5. In Eq 10, must $\\phi_C(a(\\sum m))$ be less than $\\sum m$ to ensure a profit margin? \n6. What does $\\epsilon$ in Theorem 3 represent or control?\n7. In practice, how does the central server produce a model with accuracy $a(m_i^o) + \\gamma_i(m_i)$? Is it guaranteed to be less than $a(\\sum m)$? Does the server solve for the number of additional data points to use?\n\n\nMinor suggestions\n* The theorem and corollary should come with intuitive description to aid understanding. For example, for C1, a device with lower marginal cost has higher utility and would contribute more data. \n* In definition 1, $m$ can be used in place of $\\sum \\mathbf{m}$. $\\mathbf{m}$ is not defined."
