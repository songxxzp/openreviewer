It is argued that it is helpful to alter the discount factor in order to incentivize an agent to learn early behaviors before later ones, in cases where the reward signal is a proxy reward computed based on the agent's observations in comparison to expert demonstrations. An example of such a proxy reward is optimal transport (OT) between the expert's and agent's observations. Positive results are shown on 9 Meta-World environments (e.g., comparing OT to OT + Automatic Discount Scheduling)."

I appreciate the motivating example of the Basketball task in Meta-World, wherein the agent learns to grasp the ball successfully but then sweeps it away before moving towards the hoop. Does the problem lie in (1) using any \"traditional proxy-reward-based method,\" (2) using optimal transport specifically as the reward function, (3) using optimal transport with a visual encoder that does not capture task details well, and/or (4) using optimal transport over partial observations (where the partial observations are not sufficient to deduce task progress)? My feeling is that (3) is the main reason for the described behavior in the Basketball task, but the paper seems to imply that the problem is with (1), i.e., proxy reward methods in general. I think some additional clarification on this point would be valuable.\n- Related to to the above point, is the motivating example mitigated if one uses a visual encoder that is more specific to the task instead of a frozen pre-trained ResNet -- so that the similarity function induced by the visual encoder better captures task progress? It appears that (part of) the underlying problem is that there is high visual similarity in the end frames (e.g. the visual embedding is focusing on the robot in the frame and not the basketball). Would fine-tuning your visual encoder to the demonstration (as in [1]) help address this problem?\n- What is the motivation for using longest increasing subsequence a heuristic for progress alignment? As mentioned in the paper, this seems to correspond to \"macroscopic progress.\" What are the advantages to LIS over OT for the progress recognizer; and if LIS is good at measuring task progress, can we just use it for the reward function instead of OT?\n\n[1] Haldar, Siddhant, et al. \"Teach a Robot to FISH: Versatile Imitation from One Minute of Demonstrations.\"  2023."

While many convert ILfO problems into Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RL) issues using proxy rewards, the paper identifies a limitation: tasks with a \"progress dependency\" property. In such tasks, agents must first grasp the expert's earlier behaviors before mastering subsequent ones. The study finds that reward signals for later steps impede learning initial behaviors. To overcome this, the authors introduce a new ILfO framework with an Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS) mechanism. This mechanism adaptively adjusts the RL discount factor during training, emphasizing early rewards and gradually incorporating later rewards once initial behaviors are learned. Tests on nine Meta-World tasks show this method surpasses existing techniques, even solving tasks previously deemed unsolvable."

The authors not only diagnose the issue with current ILfO algorithms but also provide a robust solution in the form of the ADS mechanism. Their method's ability to outperform state-of-the-art ILfO methods in all nine Meta-World tasks further attests to its quality.\n\nThe paper clearly articulates the challenges faced by conventional ILfO algorithms, the intricacies of tasks characterized by progress dependency, and the proposed solution. The introduction of the ADS mechanism and its role in prioritizing earlier behaviors for agents is presented with lucidity.\n\nThe significance of the paper is twofold.
