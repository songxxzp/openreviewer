By explicitly introducing error through this smoothing process, the resulting diffusion models, referred to as $\\\\sigma$-CFDM, exhibit generalization capabilities. The paper also provides proof that $\\\\sigma$-CFDM's support contains the exact barycenters of $M$-tuples from the training points. To expedite the sampling process, the authors propose techniques such as initializing with unsmoothed CFDM samples at $T>0$ and utilizing an approximate nearest neighbor search method. Notably, experiments illustrate that $\\\\sigma$-CFDM can generate novel samples without the need for a training stage."

                "value": "My primary concern about this paper revolves around the apparent simplicity of the generalization achieved by $\\sigma$-CFDM. Indeed, the generalization abilities of generative models trained on finite datasets inherently arise from their deviation from a precise fit to the empirical distribution. Introducing explicit error to the empirical distribution, as presented in this paper, seem more elegant and interpretable compared to conventional deep learning methods. However, it's important to note that the proposed smoothing method essentially makes an assumption on the underlying data distribution (or the inductive biases). It posits that the barycenters of empirical data points also reside within the supports of the true data distribution. This assumption shares similarities with the mixing of training data points. An alternative approach would be to directly sample the mixup, rendering the diffusion process unnecessary. For instance, a generative model could be defined by initially sampling $M$ training data points and then returning their barycenter (with probabilities related to the variance) as the generated sample. Alternatively, one could employ a weighted average by further sampling weighting parameters from the $(M-1)$-simplex. It would be valuable to provide a comparative analysis with these alternative methods to offer a more comprehensive evaluation (e.g. FID score and visualization). As the authors mention in Section 6.4, for image data, the barycenters may not be well-registered, and an auto-encoder is adopted, such a comparison should also be conducted in the latent space for real image generation."

Although empirical evidence is provided to justify that this error bound is pessimistic, it also renders the bound unnecessary. Meanwhile, it's unclear if the conclusion that under sigma < 0.4, a large starting T is harmless will generalize to other datasets. \n\n* The 3D point cloud experiment is interesting but I don't understand why the proposed method fills the gap there. Could the authors elaborate on this?\n\n* The practical utility of the proposed closed-form models is also unclear. Given that the model can only sample from baycenters of data point tuples, is there a clear case where we would prefer such a model over a trained score model?\n\n* This is minor, but the readability of section 3 can be greatly improved if not going to the notation convention used by rectified flow, as the proposed method can be described using the standard diffusion model formulation (where the time is reversed and stochastic transition is used). \n\n[1] Vincent, Pascal. \"A connection between score matching and denoising autoencoders.\" Neural computation 23.7 (2011): 1661-1674.\n\n[2] Dieleman, Sander, et al. \"Continuous diffusion for categorical data.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.15089 (2022)."
