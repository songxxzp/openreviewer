It is therefore not surprising that SWD can be used for mesh optimization.\n\n- I feel that the math for the probabilistic interpretation, although probably not explicitly presented in the context of mesh optimization, is unnecessary at least from the practical point of view, especially given that EMD has already been used for mesh optimization.\n\n- The presentation of the paper needs to be improved. There are many notations not explained (e.g., the # operator in Eqn. 5).\n\n- While the proposed method seems general, the scope of this paper is quite limited to cortical structures. The authors may consider trying the proposed method on general shapes and compare the results on common benchmarks (if any).\n\n[1] Wang, Weiyue, et al. \"3dn: 3d deformation network.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2019.\n\n[2] Nguyen, Trung, et al. \"Point-set distances for learning representations of 3d point clouds.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2021."

I would like the authors explain the speed difference between CD and SWD shown in Fig. 3.\n\n2. There are some improved variants of CD, such as [4].

By lying on probability measure space, it can exploit statistical shape analysis theory to approximate mesh as an oriented varifold. It proves a theorem that shows that leveraging sliced Wasserstein distance to optimize probability measures can have a fast statistical rate for approximating\nthe surfaces of the meshes.
