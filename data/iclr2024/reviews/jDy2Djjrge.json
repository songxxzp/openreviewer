                "value": "In general, the paper is an experiment oriented work which demonstrates the GPT-style structure can do various speech tasks. Specifically, this paper introduces LauraGPT, a versatile GPT model designed for audio tasks, including: automatic speech recognition, speech-to-text translation, text-to-speech synthesis, machine translation, speech enhancement, automated audio captioning, speech emotion recognition, and spoken language understanding. To enable these capabilities, the model combines continuous and discrete audio features, utilizing an audio encoder for input and a discrete codec for output. The model is then fine-tuned through supervised multitask learning on a range of audio-to-text, text-to-audio, audio-to-audio, and text-to-text tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LauraGPT achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models across various audio processing benchmarks."

By the end of 2023, speech researchers generally believe that GPT-style models can handle various speech tasks, even though certain specific tasks may not achieve state-of-the-art performance when compared to baseline models of the same size. Instead of offering insights beyond the extensive experiments conducted, the authors primarily focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of GPT-style models across multiple speech tasks.\nI hope the authors will consider demonstrating whether multi-task learning can result in task synergy, where tasks can benefit from each other rather than being treated as separate or even conflicting objectives. For instance, if I have a 1B model that solely focuses on automatic speech recognition (ASR), would it outperform a 1B model capable of performing ASR, text-to-speech (TTS), and speech-to-text (ST) tasks? If the answer is no, then why should we incorporate all these tasks into the same model? It would be valuable for the authors to analyze the relationship between task performance in the context of multi-task learning, as evidenced in Table 2, where LauraGPT lags significantly behind the state-of-the-art LibriSpeech despite its 2B model size.\n\n2. In the realm of fundamental speech models, are there any emerging points of interest similar to those in the field of natural language processing (NLP)? Exploring this aspect could be a valuable research direction. If speech researchers are unable to answer this question, I believe that running multi-task learning experiments alone may not be sufficient to construct the next generation of speech models."

For audio, LauraGPT uses a combination of discrete tokens obtained from an improved Encodec-based audio codec (where only the first quantizer is used as the tokenizer), as well as a conformer-based encoder which is initialized with weights from a pertained ASR model. The autoregressive model predicts the next token (text or audio) given the input embeddings, task embeddings, and the previously predicted tokens. The output text is obtained from the Qwen tokenizer and the final audio is obtained from a so-called codec vocoder.\n- Instead of directly using the decoder of the pre-trained audio codec, LauraGPT uses a codec vocoder wherein a transformer model serves to predicted the sum of all quantizers embedding for ground truth audio given just the first quantizer embedding and additional context. Subsequently, during inference, the predicted audio token embedding can be transformed into the summed token embeddings and passed to the pre-trained codec decoder to generated raw audio.\n- The authors evaluate LauraGPT against strong baselines for each of the task it is capable of performing. LauraGPT performs well on most tasks, only failing to beat baselines in the Speech enhancement and TTS task. It also fails to beat Whisper-Large V2 in English, which is understandable given the smaller amount of English data it was pre-trained on."

Currently, the token prediction scheme is similar to that used by SPEAR-TTS wherein each quantizer level token is predicted one-by-one before moving on to the next audio-frame\u2019s tokens.\n- Some statements are not clearly backed up by experiments. For example, one of the main contributions listed is the fact that continuous and discrete representations of audio are used in LauraGPT and that this preserves both fidelity and generality of audio data. Firstly, I am not quite sure what it means to preserve generality of audio. Second, while it is shown in the ablation that the Discrete IO model suffers, it is not clear to me how these results show that fidelity and generality is preserved because of the use of combined representations. All I see is that performance on various task is improved by using the combination. Also, one additional benefit the combined representation model sees is the use of the codec vocoder. Perhaps that is the source of the improvements in LauraGPT?\n- Section 3.4 would be well served with some more detail. The reader would benefit from some repeating information that the GPT model only uses the first quantizer. I found it difficult to understand initially and had to read from the start of section 3 again. \n- A few figures going into more detail for each of the components in figure 1 would also greatly improve the readability of the the method section.

If the new capability enabled by the proposed approach is audio output, then one of the most relevant systems appears to be AudioGPT, which also supports speech enhancement. The reason that it is not compared or included in Table 1, which shows capabilities of different existing models, is that it integrates an \"expert audio model with LLM\", which I don't fully understand the meaning of. An expanded explanation of this would be very useful in understanding this key point. \n\nAlso regarding Table 1, it should be clarified that it is showing just what the model has been trained/evaluated on, not what it is necessarily capable of. For example, any system that can perform speech to text translation should also be able to perform automatic audio captioning. Similar arguments hold for speech emotion recognition and spoken language understanding.\n\nIn terms of the significance of the results, it is interesting that these tasks can all be solved by a single model, but it's not clear that doing so gives the model advantages over separate models. The performance seems mostly on par. It is also not clear whether the other multimodal systems described in Table 1 (especially SpeechT5) would do better than the proposed system on these tasks as the comparisons are only against single-task systems trained on much less data (the subset of the data that the proposed system was trained on for each particular task).\n\nIn terms of clarity, two different taxonomies of related models are introduced in sections 1 and 2, these could be combined into a single one to make space for more explanation of the data that the model was trained on from the appendix. In particular, it is not clear in the body of the paper whether the model is trained once on all of the data or separately for different tasks or how that is navigated and how much data it is overall.\n\nSome claims about the proposed model's superiority are not well supported by the results. Specifically the claim of being best on SLU, when it is really just SLU accuracy, but not f1 scores. This is also the case for SER in that the proposed model is better on unweighted accuracy, but not weighted f1 or accuracy. \n\nMinor comments:\n* A definition of the \"endless looping problem\" and \"loop ratio\" would be helpful in the appendix\n* \"These results indicate that LauraGPT tends to generate captions that closely match one of the references...\" can you explain how you reach this conclusion?\n* Please define exactly what \"clean_codec_syn\" is in table 7\n* In the appendix, prosody includes both tone and speed, so no need to list them separately\n* In the appendix, I believe \"dereverberation\" is meant instead of \"echo cancellation\" which involves an echo back to the far end of a telephone call, typically.\n* In the appendix, \"For the SER task, we collect corpora including...\" are there other corpora used?
