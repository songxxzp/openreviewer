The motivation is to find commonality among datasets in terms of the latent space and aid in data pooling / data harmonisation, something that is needed when data collection is expensive and data from multiple sources need to be combined.  The hope is that the theory is able to define structure and invariances/equivariances between them,, and invariance to shifts in feature distributions for clinical and demographic features when dealing with image data would be easily drawn. For quantifying  the shift, minimum distance and cosine sim are employed. The paper also describes a reinterpretaion of two differentiable models from adversarial and self-supervised learning families, and walks through a demonstration of latent space operation sequences on MNIST before developing notions of losses and evaluations on data. It reads almost like a position paper with few evaluations."

Invariance to\nsome covariate shifts, e.g., using different acquisition devices, are\nmodeled by enforcing similar latent space\nrepresentations. Equivariance is obtained by enforcing a chosen\ntransformation. Experimens show that the resulting model can retain\naccuracy while removing differences between samples with covariate\nshift in the latent space in cases where invariance is\ndesired. When equivariance is desired, authors show that the latent\nspace transformations are also good."

Experimental results are motivating. Authors compare with some\n   recent work to convince us that the model proposed is indeed\n   useful.\n4.

This\n   should be clearly discussed early on in the article to avoid any\n   confusions and - to be honest - false hope. Given two data sets\n   whose covariate values do not overlap, the current method may not\n   work at all. \n2. The emphasis on couterfactuals is rather questionable. There is no\n   decoupling of the effects of different covariates on data. In other\n   words, a transformation in the latent space may correspond to\n   changes in multiple covariates. A well curated data set may avoid\n   this problem, however, generally this will not hold. Therefore, it\n   is difficult to discuss about counterfactuals and even\n   interventions. The latent space transformations will not be able to\n   account a missing causal model linking covariates, observed\n   images and labels. I recommend authors to reconsider claims\n   regarding counterfactuals.\n3. Figure 5 is not explained at all. This seems like an important\n   figure and requires further explanation in the text.\n4. I find the claim that this approach simplifies recent\n   works in the literature not substantiated.
