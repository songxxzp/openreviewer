Considering the disparity in the accumulated spectral energy between the anomalies and normal graphs, RQGNN leverages the Rayleigh Quotient learning component to capture the accumulated spectral energy of graphs. In addition, RQGNN also proposes the Chebyshev Wavelet GNN to represent nodes. RQ-pooling that regards the Rayleigh Quotient coefficient as the node importance score will be employed to obtain graph representation. The final graph representation is the concatenation of the Rayleigh Quotient learning component and the Chebyshev Wavelet GNN. Finally, class-balanced focal loss is introduced to optimize RQGNN and obtain graphs\u2019 binary labels."

Figures 1 and 4-12 do not clearly show the statistical difference between anomalous graphs and normal graphs with respect to Rayleigh Quotient. Detailed text description about the ''significant disparity\" between two classes is necessary but not found on the current version. (This is the main reason why I currently tend to reject this paper.)\n2.\tI recommend briefly introducing Rayleigh Quotient in the introduction or preliminaries section.\n3.\tIn page 4,  authors wrote  \"If the graph Laplacian $\\mathbf L$ and graph signal $\\mathbf x$ of two graphs are close, then their Rayleigh Quotients will be close to each other and these two graphs will highly likely belong to the same class.\" I tend to think this statement is correct, but it seems not applicable for anomalies. Anything that is different from normal can be regarded as an anomaly, but we actually cannot get training data that can represent the full picture of anomalies. In addition, two anomalous graphs can also be very different. This paper uses two-class datasets for experiments, but what will be the result if we regard the third class that has never appeared in the training set as anomalies to test the proposed model?\n4.\tIn page 5, authors wrote \"However, as analyzed in Section 3.1, to capture the spectral properties of anomalous graphs, it is necessary to consider the spectral energy with respect to each eigenvalue.\" But, the reason for using graph wavelet convolution is still unclear."

From the objective function in Section 3, the method proposed in this paper is a supervised method.

The authors only test on chemical datasets in this paper, while there are other data types that are constructed as graphs, such as social networks.\n5. It seems that the proposed RQGNN fluctuates a lot with the change of hyperparameters and shows instability. The authors should explain the reasons for this observation.\n6. The impact of hyperparameters on loss function is encouraged to be explored.\n7. From the ablation study results, the performance of RQGNN does not consistently outperform the other degradation models, and their performance is quite close in many cases.
