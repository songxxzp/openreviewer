I would suggest the author to move this part to appendix as this is not the contribution of this paper.\n(3) For the conditioner part, how does the cross-attention exactly used? Will it be able to automatically detect which task the model is focusing on?\n(4) There are quite a few confusing part in the paper. For instance, the paper claims that it forms the task into a posterior estimation, but how the prior is used in the model? I don't think the paper explicitly explains this. Also, for cell labeling and knowledge transfer, I don't thinks it's a generation task so that generative model is a good practice in this case. Intuitively cell lebeling and knowledge transfer is more like a prediction task to me.\n(5) I don't feel the strong motivation of using a attention mechanism to help the model learn specific tasks. To me it's more like the proposed method assembles three tasks very hard to let the model to learn. Therefore, the proposed method lacks novelty as each individual task can still be solved in the same framework.\n(6) I'm also confused about the current formation of the x_\\theta(x_0, \\epsilon, c, t). Why not just follow the standard way as in CV that just uses U-Net? I strongly suggest the author to clarify the motivation of their model structure.\n\n[1] Liu et al., Evaluating the Utilities of Large Language Models in Single-cell Data Analysis"

Furthermore, the authors have not quantified the computational cost associated with having a unified model that covers multiple tasks, particularly in relation to the observed improvements. While the enhanced performance might not necessarily stem from the model's extension, it could be attributed to factors like the use of the diffusion process, attention units, or different implementations.\n\n\n**Minor:**\n\n- Some of the experimental settings descriptions, such as those outlined in section 4.2.1, are not clearly explained and can be rather confusing.

In biology, we know that non or less-expressed genes can still play a marker role in some cell types.\n\n- Can you provide further elaboration on Equation 10? It is not entirely clear why the single-cell data are encoded using the suggested *\"TimeEmbed\"* function.\n\n- Why does scDiff utilize a linear encoder / decoder?\n\n- It would be insightful to understand the computational efficiency of using a model like scDiff compared to an equivalent model designed solely for solving one or a few downstream tasks.\n\n- In Table 2a, for the missing value imputation task, the authors reported correlation values. However, is not the primary goal to approximate the value of gene expression rather than capturing the overall expression pattern (correlation at the gene population level)? It might be more informative if the authors report the average (normalized) error.\n\n- In Table 2, it would be beneficial to include the number of genes used for each task per dataset.\n\n- For the study in Table 2a, is there any consideration for zero-expressed genes?\n\n- What is the chance level in Figure 2?

Given that this is an application to a new domain, rather than evaluating it on a suite of tasks with the same mode., it might make sense to characterize the model and the validity of those choices for scRNA-seq datasets.\n\n - W3. The authors tune their own model, and report performance with default values for competing methods. I appreciate the transparency in communication, but it makes it harder to interpret results. Perhaps using benchmarks where train/test splits are fixed, and other methods are reported with tuned performance would be more informative. [Openproblems](https://openproblems.bio/) curates such benchmarks on a wide variety of such tasks for many easy-to-access datasets. Performing some evaluations with those datasets and comparing the pre-defined metrics on those tasks against the leaderboard there would certainly boost my confidence in results.\n\n - W4. While there is an impressive number of tests performed with scDiff coming out on top on all fronts, it is unclear why there is a marked improvement. In particular details about the training and testing procedure are missing at a granular-enough level to reproduce results. For example, the Jurkat dataset consists of ~3,000 cells and ~12,000 genes. Was the network trained from scratch on this? Was any preprocessing / feature selection used to report results on that dataset?\n\n Overall there isn't substantial new methodological development; the performance on scRNAseq datasets is impressive, but manuscript lacks sufficient detail to reproduce them.

                "value": "I have three nitpicks to note in the paper.\n\nFirst, the application here is straightforward, no core ML innovation was necessary to execute this project.\nHowever, I think that realizing how diffusion models map to this important modeling domain and executing the basics well once absolutely justifies this well-executed paper, but I wanted to note that it is not innovating dramatically.\n\nSecond, the authors keep using the term \"casting single cell tasks as posterior inference\" throughout the paper, but do not really perform much inference in truth beyond the classical training scenario of diffusion models. \nI would prefer if they used language like \"we cast these tasks as probabilistic modeling using a shared model\", since inference is not the heart of the story here and in fact is relatively generically solved since we do not really inspect posterior distributions per layer over specific conditions and so on.  This is a minor point, but since I anticipate this paper to be read a lot it would be good to use that language carefully.\n\nIf I can add a third nitpick, the imputation task is not entirely correct in how it is phrased as a conditioning setting. \nIf the authors inspect their predictive distribution, it probably contains outputs beyond the ones that are visible.\nI understand the conditioning mechanism injected per layer will increase affinity towards imputing the right thing, but it's not exactly p(x|m*x) that the authors are modeling, but rather a p(x*|m*x) where x* is sampled from \"some\" distribution conditioned on embeddings of x*m.\nI want to point out that I find this to be a fine approximation to the task and not a reason to reject the paper, but I would prefer the authors to call it out as such and leave space for future improvements."

                "value": "I would be curious to see the scaling behavior of the systems the authors study given different dataset sizes.\n\nDiffusion models tend to be data and compute hungry, how do they behave here? Can we apply them on one screen?\nDo we have to pre-retrain them broadly?\n\nI am sold on the modeling framework and think this paper will stand on its own, but the field would get more value out of it if we inspected these questions of data efficiency."
