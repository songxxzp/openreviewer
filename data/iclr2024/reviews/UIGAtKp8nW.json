Overall, I believe that this manuscript is a high-quality, well-executed benchmark paper of UQ methods for molecular machine learning field.

One example is (pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00502), which should be discussed and included in the reference.\n\n2. Besides the fact that UQ methods can improve the accuracy of models, it is also valuable in the domain of molecular machine learning because it can aid many other machine learning applications such as [1] identifying the activity cliff and adding explainability to model (e.g. pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01073), and [2] Active learning virtual screening of large compound libraries (pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/sc/d0sc06805e). The uncertainty value (e.g. variance predicted by model or obtained from ensemble) can provided explainability to deep learning methods, especially in areas where explainability is important (such as drug discovery). The authors did not mention those advantages of UQ in molecular machine learning field.\n\n3. Some of the models benchmarked are pretrained on larger dataset (ChemBERTA, Uni-mol). Some other models in this work bear the potential of being pretrained (e.g. GIN can be trained using contrastive learning on molecular graph, and TorchMD-net can be pre-trained in a denoising manner). It would be very interesting if we can understand the better performance of pretrained models from the UQ perspective. Unfortunately, the paper did not discuss how pretraining can affect the uncertainty of models."

Also, I do not find any non-UQ baseline in this work. Can authors add a non-UQ baseline to show improvements brought by UQ methods?\n\n2. For the deep ensemble methods, how does the number of models in the ensemble affects the ensemble variance on different benchmarks?\n\n3.

MUBen employs four pretrained \"backbone\" models with near SOTA performance, one for each of four different input molecular representations: ChemBERTa for SMILES, GROVER for 2D graphs, Uni-Mol for 3D conformations, and fully-connected NNs for RDKit features. Two other pretrained models are included to provide additional insights: TorchMD-NET, a transformer pretrained on QM properties, and GIN, a powerful GNN. The authors fine-tune these models on MoleculeNet datasets, providing a mixture of classification and regression tasks across a variety of physiological, biophysical, physical chemical, and quantum properties. In the paper, the authors benchmark a number of uncertainty estimation methods: focal loss, temperatures scaling, deep ensembles, Bayes for Backprop (BBP), Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), MC Dropout, and Stochastic Weight Average-Gaussian. For model performance, the authors report AUC for classification tasks, and RMSE and MAE for regression tasks. For uncertainty estimation, the authors report the negative log likelihood (NLL), Brier score, and expected calibration error for classification tasks, and Gaussian NLL and regression calibration error for regression tasks. By computing the performance and uncertainty scores for all models across all tasks, the authors qualitatively conclude that Deep Ensembles perform best overall, though are computationally expensive, while temperature scaling and MC Dropout are good choices for classification tasks, and BBP and SGLD are good for regression tasks. They also conclude that Uni-Mol, trained on 3D conformations, performs best among backbones."

Also \"As presented in the tables and Figure 5, TorchMD-NET\u2019s performance is on par with Uni-Mol when predicting quantum mechanical properties but falls short in others\", however TorchMD-NET seems to be as on par for biophysical properties too.

Consequently, the quantification of uncertainty (UQ) is recognized as an extremely crucial issue. Yet, there is a lack of standard benchmark platform to comprehensively and systematically investigate such methods. The benchmark proposed in this paper provides researchers with a practical testing platform to exhaustively assess both predictive and UQ performance across numerous downstream tasks. Moreover, the paper reports comprehensive benchmark results using several widely-used pre-trained molecular models. It provides empirically valuable insights into how the combination of pre-trained models and UQ methods can potentially impact both predictive and UQ performances."

Firstly, while Deep Ensembles are fundamentally distinct from other UQ methods being an intrinsic ensemble learning approach and it's intriguing that they perform well even with M=3, it can be intuitively expected that they would likely be the most stable. Although Deep Ensembles necessitate the training of multiple models, which can be resource and time-intensive, this aspect has not been thoroughly explored in this paper. Furthermore, the standout performance of Uni-Mol, which correlates highly with predictive capability, may suggest a straightforward interpretation that later models simply yield better results in UQ. This can be attributed to the fact that the MoleculeNet tasks utilized here have been widely employed for validating molecular pre-training. The original Uni-Mol paper already demonstrated its superior predictive performance compared to traditional methods, and it might be practically sufficient to have stable UQ by using deep ensembles of Uni-Mol. Therefore, if the UQ evaluation highly correlates with this, the implications provided by the validation using this benchmark might appear limited. If the focus is on UQ validation during fine-tuning of pre-trained molecular models, it might also suggest the need for a research environment that can conduct evaluations more broadly beyond just MoleculeNet."

If one has the time and resources to implement Deep Ensembles, it is clear that it would be a preferred option. The paper concludes that Deep Ensembles come \"with significant computation cost,\" but are there any actual comparative results on computation cost presented?\n\nQ2. When using MoleculeNet as the downstream task based on this benchmark, how much of a difference is there in terms of computation cost? How long does it take to fine-tune? (I mean when comparing deep ensembles vs others)\n\nQ3. I understand that scaffold splitting for train/test division is beneficial for evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) characteristics. However, scaffold splitting has been widely used in evaluating the performance of existing pre-trained molecular representations for downstream tasks. Hence, the pre-trained models adopted as baselines in this benchmark have already been confirmed to perform well, assuming scaffold splitting (with MolecularNet data as the downstream tasks). In this regard, I feel it might be more appropriate, both for a realistic evaluation of UQ and in consideration of OOD characteristics, to base the benchmark on data other than MoleculeNet.
