My concerns and questions are as follows:\n\n- What is the difference of the generation scheme in Figure 1a with that of Augmented Memory?\n- The *Autoregressive Language-based Molecular Generative Model* paragraph in *Proposed Method* section should be moved to *Related Work* section as that part is not proposed by this paper.\n- Are there any ablation studies that quantify the effects of Augmented Memory? Are there experiments that quantify the effects of the combination of Beam Enumeration and other generative models?\n- The method description seems a bit vague. I recommend to explain the self-conditionining scheme in paragraph *Self-conditioned Generation* more concretely.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Guo et al., Augmented memory: capitalizing on experience replay to accelerate de novo molecular design, arXiv 2023."

A comprehensive pseudo-code encompassing the entire algorithm, rather than just the beam enumeration, would be beneficial.\n\n## Exaggerated Claims\nThe assertion that this is the \"first method to concurrently address explainability and sample efficiency\" is overstated.

There are additional results in the appendix regarding the impact of the proposed Beam Enumeration scheme on reducing diversity.\nWhile the main text briefly mentions such diversity reduction is expected, the paper would benefit from having (at least some) further discussion (in the main text) on this effect and its extent.\n\n2. There should be further investigation of the impact of k (i.e., the number of top substructures) on the performance of Beam Enumeration.\nThe authors hypothesize that a low top k would be optimal, but wouldn't the use of small k potentially lead to molecules with repetitive substructures and undesirably limit the molecular diversity?\n\n3. Similarly, the manuscript could benefit from having further discussion on the optimal choice of the \"Structure Minimum Size\" - currently set at 15 in the experiments - and its impact on the overall performance.\nIt is mentioned that \"larger substructures ... improves performance\" but what is the best minimum size to use?\nIncreasing it beyond some number would certainly degrade the performance of the molecules and also limit the diversity of the generated molecules significantly.\n\n4. The multi-property optimization (MPO) aspects will need to be discussed in further details.\nCurrently, the MPO appears to completely rely on the baseline algorithm (e.g., Augmented Memory or REINVENT) to be extended with the Beamn Enumeration capability.\nBut since different substructures might be associated with different properties, incorporation of Beam Enumeration for MPO would have to consider the impact of self-conditioned molecular generation when used with a specific baseline algorithm and a specific number of properties for optimization.\nFor example, one may expect that when optimizing a large number of properties, then using a very small k may be detrimental as the selected substructures may be associated with only some of the properties of interest.\n\n5. Finally, while the paper focuses on language models for molecular generation and uses Beam Enumeration for self-conditioning the generative process by filtering the most probable substructures, it would be great if the authors could discuss how similar ideas may be used to extend other types of popular generative molecular design models (e.g., latent space models based on VAE, JT-VAE).\nEspecially, models like the JT-VAE optimize molecules by sampling & assembling substructures (in the form of junction trees), which - at least at a conceptual level - *may* be related to the core \"self-conditioning\" idea in Beam Enumeration, to prioritize certain substructures.\nWhile this may be beyond the scope of the current work, having at least some high-level discussion might benefit the readers."

This paper introduces Beam Enumeration as a solution, aiming to exhaustively enumerate the most probable sub-sequences from language-based molecular generative models. The method demonstrates the extraction of meaningful molecular substructures. When integrated with reinforcement learning, these extracted substructures contribute to enhanced explainability and improved sample efficiency through self-conditioned generation. Notably, Beam Enumeration is adaptable to any language-based molecular generative model and significantly enhances the performance of the Augmented Memory algorithm, a recent state-of-the-art achievement in sample efficiency on the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark. The joint focus on explainability and sample efficiency makes Beam Enumeration a pioneering method in the field of molecular design."
