The paper also talks about sim2real where oscillations are indeed a common problem, but the authors do not make a convincing argument that this is due to non-smooth policies. Sometimes it might be but this has not been well explored as far as I am aware. Overall the paper does a good job of benchmarking existing approaches to increase policy smoothness, but the sim2real / oscillation connection seems weak.\n- More in that vein, the sim2real is only attempted with the best performing method from simulation. If simulation was a good indicator of real-world performance, sim2real would be much easier than it currently is, but this is not the case in my experience. If you want to make this paper about sim2real instead of just policy smoothness, then it would be useful if you had tested all the approaches in the real world to see how the approaches generalized. It would also have been useful to see a video of the experiments as is conventional in robotics. Did the robot actually oscillate or is your smoothness metric just picking up a quick motion (e.g, a simple step function also has high-frequency components)? These can sometimes be desirable. \n\nAs it currently stands, I would consider toning down the sim2real implications a little bit and focus more on smoothness.\n\nMinor: \ntypo: hyperaparameter"
