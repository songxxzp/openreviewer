                "value": "The authors focus on accelerating the Sinkhorn algorithm for optimal transport (OT). The Sinkhorn algorithm is an iterative matrix scaling algorithm used to solve the entropy-reularized OT problem. Its per-iteration complexity is $O(n^2)$ for discrete distributions of size $n$. Its convergence rate behaves like a polynomial converging method, which can be slow. Other optimization methods like second-order methods enjoy super-exponential convergence, but a greater per-itereration cost $O(n^3)$ (e.g. Newton). Here they find a link between the Sinkhorn iterations and the sparsity of the Hessian of the Lyapunov potential. Once the Hessian is sparse, the per-iteration cost can reach $O(n^2)$, hence the same per-iteration cost as Sinkhron while benefiting from the faster convergence rate of the second-order methods. The authors propose to combine the two methods, i.e. Newton iteration once the Hessian is sparse, which improves the convergence rate. They provide quantitative results to validate the algorithm."

They don't inform us on the quality of the approximation. It could be interesting to compare the accuracy of the plan in the case where we have a closed form (e.g. entropic OT between Gaussian distributions [4]). \n- The authors could add a brief review of Newton\u2019s algorithm since it is an important piece of the paper. In particular, on the importance of solving the Hessian system. \n- In eq. 1, you need to define $\\eta$ and specify if it should be greater than zero.\n- Having a preliminary or background section could help.
