For example, this is the major goal of the theoretical analysis in the Intact-VAE paper.~~\nMoreover, the 2nd independence assumption (through mutual information) violates the Markov condition; Z3 and Y are related through the path Z3-T-Y. Any violations of Markov condition are dubious without detailed justification.\n\nIn Prop 2, g maps three variables to a variable. Then, injectivity is impossible unless the domain of g is in fact a 1-dim manifold embedded in the 3-dim space. Similarly, assuming functions K4-K7 are injective is unrealistic.\n\n*Insufficient experimental evidence, particularly for identification and zero overlap* \n\nThe experiments only examine the ATE error and PEHE, without touching on identification. In Fig 3, there are no legends for the x-axis, but the tendency of the proposed method is no better than others.\n\n\nIn Sec 5.3, the claim \u201ceven in the in-sample scenario, \u03b2-Intact-VAE struggles to generate a balanced prognostic score in the presence of instruments\u201d is unconvincing. You only show your method has lower errors, but the reason might be, for example, that your method has better fitting capacity. Moreover, the claim \u201cThe performance of DR-CFR diminishes as the limited overlapping level becomes more severe\u201d is also unconvincing, the differences are very small and in the range of error bars.\n\n*The claim of handling zero overlap is not theoretically supported.* \n\nBut the claims in the Abstract and contributions make readers think the opposite. The statement \u201csince DIRE also generalizes its identification capability to the out-sample setting, \u2026\u201d at the end of Sec 5.2 is also read as if there are theoretical supports.\n\n*No support for the identification of balancing score*. In fact, after it is claimed in the Abstract and contributions, the only place this is mentioned is at the end of Sec 4 \u201cwe predict the treatment using the identifiable balancing score\u201d; again, a blank claim.\n\n*Discrepancy between the theory and method*\n\nIf the theory works, there is no need to use the \u201cELBO decomposition trick\u201d and to add L_{prognostic score} and L_{balancing score}. In general, any departure of practical choices and the theory should be discussed and/or supported by experiments.\n\n*Writing is very unclear and sloppy*\n\nThe theoretical assumptions and statements are not clear and/or not discussed clearly.\n\n- Assum 4.1, the \u201ccircle-plus\u201d symbol is used without introduction. I assume it means \u201cconcatenate the dimensions together\u201d.\n- Assum 4.2, I assume p in eq3 means p(Z1, Z2), but, if j_t is just a general function, what is the difference between the two sides of the 2nd equality? I don\u2019t think \u201cthe second equality is obtained through backdoor criterion\u201d is a meaningful explanation. Also, the symbol j_t is used without introduction (though I know you are following the previous work.)\n- Assum 4.4 comes from nowhere. We need the discussion of its causal meaning, or, if it is a technical assumption, why it should hold in practice should be discussed. For example, rank conditions are usually critical for identification, so we care what is n here?\n- I cannot understand Prop 1. There is a \u201cwhere j =\u201d clause, but j is even not mentioned before! (I assume it is not j_t in eq4). And I cannot understand why it means \u201cwe can always derive a balanced prognostic score\u201d.\n- In Theorem 1, p_{theta} is used before introduction.\n- Symbol p is overloaded, meaning either prognostic score or probability.\n\nThe major (unrealistic) assumptions, as I mentioned in the first weakness, are not listed formally as in Assumption 4.1 etc, but are mentioned in the pass in the theorems.

To be specific, traditional causal inference methods require substantial overlap in covariates between different treatment groups to accurately estimate treatment effects. The paper focuses on cases where this condition is not met, which is challenging for existing methods. The authors propose a solution that allows for the estimation of treatment effects when covariate overlap is insufficient. They achieve this by recovering two types of scores:\n   - **Balanced Prognostic Score**: Reflects the expected outcome of an individual without treatment.\n   - **Balancing Score**: Indicates the probability of an individual receiving a particular treatment, given their covariates.\n\nThe Disentangled Identifiable vaRiational autoEncoder (DIRE) is introduced as a key technical tool. It is a model that disentangles the factors of variation in the data while maintaining identifiable features. Besides, the paper presents theoretical arguments for how the balanced prognostic score effectively manages the issue of limited overlap, and how it can adapt to scenarios where there is zero overlap, addressing out-of-distribution treatments.\n\nFinally, the authors conduct extensive experiments that benchmark their method against others, especially in scenarios with binary treatments and in complex situations where traditional methods may fail due to limited covariate overlap."

It is crucial for the reader to understand the extent to which this method can effectively operate within various levels of non-overlap. Could the author provide a more detailed explanation? Additionally, the experiment study (Q2) suggests that the proposed \"DIRE\" method's performance is unaffected by the degree of non-overlapping. This assertion underscores the robustness of the method, but it warrants a deeper explanation to substantiate such a claim.\n\n2. Section 4.3 discusses the integration of an 'ELBO decomposition trick' into the method, which contributes to the final loss function. The specific advantages of incorporating this technique, particularly in the context of addressing limited overlap issues, have not been fully articulated. What incremental value does this approach provide, and how does it interact with the other components of the loss function, namely the prognostic score-based and balancing score-based losses? If the loss function were simplified to include only these two components, how might that impact the method's performance?\n\n3. In section 5.4, the paper navigates the complex terrain of structured treatment settings. An elucidation of the inherent challenges within such settings would greatly benefit the reader. Does this term imply a scenario with a multitude of treatments amongst which certain structural patterns are discernible? If so, to the best of my knowledge, two interesting studies can be noted: one from the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) in 2023: \"Learning Optimal Group-structured Individualized Treatment Rules with Many Treatments\", and another from the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference in 2022: \"Learning Individualized Treatment Rules with Many Treatments: A Supervised Clustering Approach Using Adaptive Fusion\". Both papers address situations of limited overlap amid an array of many treatments, focusing primarily on the refinement of individualized treatment rules. However, there appears to be a difference in their approaches compared to the one presented in this paper. Could the author expound on the distinctions and potential synergies between these methodologies and the current approach under discussion?"
