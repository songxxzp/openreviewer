Most notably, the paper criticizes the assumptions made by existing strategies but doesn't explicitly state its own assumptions on the missingness process despite relying on either \"missing at random\" or \"completely at random.\" Presently, the experiments only explore \"missing completely at random,\" which raises questions about its practical applicability.\n\n**Presentation:**  \nThe description of the model is currently intricate and would benefit from a simplified presentation. It would be useful to clarify the problem as an optimization problem in which the role of the NN and RNN is clarified. Furthermore, the approach of modeling the residual of the previous model bears resemblance to a boosting approach but this connection is unclear.\n\n**Significance:**  \nThe paper mentions a few existing works but overlooks contributions related to Gaussian processes and RBF interpolation [1]. It is essential for the paper to describe this existing literature and clarifies how it distinguishes itself and builds upon it.\n\n**Technical Soundness:**   \nAs previously mentioned, the methodology needs clarification to assess its technical soundness. Moreover, the experimental setup should incorporate hyperparameter tuning to ensure that the observed performance differences are not solely due to inadequate parameter choices. Additionally, including confidence intervals in the results would help in understanding the significancne of the proposed strategy's improvement.\n\n[1] Wright, G. B. (2003).

Furthermore, it affects the uncertainty in the analysis as fewer data points are available for model training. \n- The claim that \"However, the practical usability of GRU-D may be limited when there is no clear inherent correlation between the missing patterns in the dataset and the prediction task\" requires justification. The paper should elaborate on why this might be the case and under what conditions GRU-D may not provide informative results.\n- The paper should clarify what \"GRUI\" stands for.\n- When stating that RBF networks are often referred to as universal function approximators, the paper should substantiate this claim with relevant references, such as \"Park, J., & Sandberg, I. W. (1991). Universal approximation using radial-basis-function networks. Neural computation, 3(2), 246-257.\""

The method is evaluated on two datasets (with an additional dataset for ablation study only in the Appendix), demonstrating improved imputation performance over conventional deterministic imputation methods.\n\nOverall, the paper is not ready for publication at ICLR in its current form. Firstly, the exposition of the paper is poor, with notations that are not well-defined and consistent throughout the document. Secondly, the paper's position is not clearly stated, and the technical contribution over previous work is vague. Thirdly, the learning of RBFs is not clearly described. Lastly, the experiments are limited to time-series data favorable for their design choices, and the technical claims are not well supported by the evaluation."

Moreover, the reasons for the confounding effects of the autoregressive imputation methods and why the proposed methods deviate from such limitations are not well clarified.\n3. The procedure of learning multiple RBFs based on the residuals (in Section 3.1) needs improvement; currently, it is difficult to follow. Some notations are used without clear definitions.\n4. The initialization of RBF components and how those components are trained based on the given time-series dataset are not clearly described.\n5. Equation (11) should be clarified.\n6. The experiments should provide a more in-depth analysis of the impact of different missingness assumptions (e.g., MAR, MANR) and a wider range of time-series datasets. Some important time-series imputation methods (e.g., GP-VAE [A], CSDI [B]) are missing in the comparison.\n7. Evaluations on the ETT dataset are only given in the Appendix.

Regarding Weakness 2: The imputation of the proposed method is carried out in two phases: i) constructing RBFs and ii) using autoregressive RNN predictions using the continuous functions learned in phase i). Considering this, how can the authors claim that the proposed method deviates from the confounding effects of autoregressive models mentioned in Related Work?\n2. The authors demonstrated in Appendix C that sharing the RBF functions across different features enhances imputation performance compared to using individual RBF functions. However, the reviewer believes that this approach could pose challenges when two time-varying features exhibit distinct temporal dynamics, such as different periodicities, a common occurrence in healthcare datasets (i.e., the domain mentioned in one of the applications). One can expect similar behaviors across different features for the evaluated datasets. What happens if such property is violated?\n3. Some other time-varying features may be informative about a given time-varying feature, which, in turn, will help in imputing missing values in that feature. However, the proposed RBF construction lacks such dependencies. Please describe what happens if there exist strong dependencies across time-varying features."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Although paper is generally well written, some claims I would disagree with. For example, as a part of motivation it was stated that some competitor approaches \"they often rely on strong assumptions, such as presuming that the data adheres to a particular model distribution, or they incorporate information beyond what is available in multivariate time series data, such as specific location data. Consequently, these approaches may struggle to capture the data distribution adequately and may not guarantee good performance on data that deviates from the model assumptions or lacks location information\". It is fair statement though, but it would be fair to also recognize that the Radial Basis Function also assume 'strong assumption' that the value of a function depends only on the distance from a certain fixed point. Moreover Gaussian RBF is using additional strong assumption that value of function decays exponentially as the distance increase.\n\n\nAlso, empirical evaluation, while impressive, it appears to be conflicted with some previously published results. For example, as reported in SAITS paper its performance should be comparable to BRITS on AirQuality dataset - but in Table 1 it is significantly worse than BRITS.\nAlso self-reported results on AirQuality application (in the BRITS paper) appear better than reported in Table 1.\n\nIts not clear why MIM-RBFNN trains a sequence of RBFNNs in a boosting-like fashion. It would be good to make comparison against using just a single RBFNN but with more parameters (more expressive). Also, comparison against Gaussian Processes would be interesting."
