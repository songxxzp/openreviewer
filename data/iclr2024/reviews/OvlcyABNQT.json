Typically, BO methods for RL estimate the objective function (dsicounted rewards) using Gaussian Processes (GP) with a constant mean function for the GP prior. In this work the authors propose a new mean function for the GP prior based on empirical estaimtes of the objective function and the advantages between the old policy and new policy. By using this advantage mean function the authors show that the gradient of the posterior takes the form of the deterministic policy gradient corrected by how closely the mean function fits the observed dataset. This approach is theoretically backed by a new bound derived by the aithors that bounds the residual term of a rearranging of the performance difference lemma for Lipschitz MDPs. Finally, the authors also develop an adaptive scheme for aggregating ensembles of Q function estimators based on fitness measure (R-squared) on the whole dataset."

Performance is only marginally better/worse than existing methods\n\n3. This is not a weakness/critique directly but it relates to point 2. Also this point will be a bit opinionated.\n\nI do not believe that the \"classical RL setup\" of:  exploration towards exploitation(i.e. gradually improving/figuring out the task) is where this method is applied best. Essentially you use the BO + the local mean function interpolation to iteratively improve the policy estimation.    That is why, comparing to \"less rigorous/Bayesian\" approaches the improvements are not very striking\n\nHowever, I believe a stronger case can be made if you would look at the method from a risk-sensitive perspective. Your mean function will give you an informed estimate around the known evaluation. The more you move away from that the more the epistemic uncertainty of the probabilitc model will set in. This would enable you to essentially define a \"safe zone\" around your current estimate.  And your method would have a better informed safe zone compared to other approaches because you leverage the information better using the advantage mean function. Therefore I would expect that your method would still maintain the advantages of a risk-sensitive method (i.e. by monotonic improvement over time) but be more \"quick\"/greedy compared to traditional risk-sensitive approaches.\n\n4. Related,  conceptually speaking   you make your mean function more informed utilizing the performance difference lemma. This, essentially is a form of interpolation from existing points (i.e. estimating the return of a policy \\phi, given knowledge of the return of policy \\theta.).  Such knowledge/modelling naturally would go to the kernel function, instead.  The result of your current approach, infusing it in the mean funciton instead,  is that while you mean function is more informed, your covariance function is not.  Therefore, your covariance function will only be a function of the standard kernel function and X.  This means, your estimate of predictive epistemic uncertainty does not take into account the insight \"using the knowledge of \\theta I can make a more informed guess about the policy \\phi\". So in my opinion you are still underutilizing the insight described in this paper."

                "value": "This paper presents a method for policy search/actor critic based on local Bayesian optimization. The main contribution is in the use of a mean function that captures the advantage (critic) of the model  that relates a set of parameters theta with the queried set of parameters x."

                "value": "The idea of using the recent local Bayesian optimization methods for efficient policy search for high dimensional problems is quite interesting. Furthermore, it is well integrated with the performance difference lemma to enable updates on the information of theta with queries at x. I can see a lot of potential of this work in the community."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There are some limitations that can reduce the applicability of this work and make it difficult to understand. For example, it is never explained the type of policy being used. The derivation is based on nonparametric (tabular) policies, but those type of policies are too limited for the MuJoCo experiments. Even the linear policy seems to be very limited.\nThe idea of incorporating information from x at theta is interesting, but that still requires to sample rollouts from the policy pi_x, which seems counterintutive in a BO setting where sample efficiency is of paramount importance. It seems that the philosophy behind the mean function is similar to having a GP with inducing points. The other advantage of using pi_x seems exploration, but that can also be achieved with importance sampling.\nGiven the nature of the application (sample efficient PS), the authors should include in the comparison both novel AC methods (SAC, TQC\u2026), model based approaches which are also sample efficient (MBPO\u2026). For example, according to the MBPO paper [A], MBPO is able to achieve 6000 reward in a similar number of steps than ABS gets 4000.\n\n[A] Janner M, Fu J, Zhang M, Levine S.

What do you mean by discounted policy returns? It seems that the undiscounted returns like the ones presented in the appendix are more standard in the literature and allows comparisons with other works. Also, the standard approach is to use steps for the horizontal axis, instead of episodes.\n-The R2 analysis is unclear. The fact that for many iterations the correlation is negative and it is mostly below 0.5 means that the fitness might not be accurate. Furthermore, the R2 is a fitness measurement for linear regression, which does not seem to be the case for the Q-function.\n-Policy search with Bayesian optimization has been extensively studied since 2007 [B] and there are many works missing. For example, [C] presented a PS method with BO using local models as well, while [D] also combines parametric and non-parametric (GP) models.\n\n[B] Martinez-Cantin R, de Freitas N, Doucet A, Castellanos JA.
