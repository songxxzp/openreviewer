These models can be exploited to generate sexually explicit content, mirror artistic styles without authorization, or even fabricate celebrity likenesses. A variety of methods have been proposed to \"erase\" sensitive concepts from these text-to-image models, some of which claim to \"permanently remove targeted concepts from the weights.\" Empirical evidence across multiple test instances and use-cases like object removal and artistic style forgetting seem to support the efficacy of these erasure methods. However, the authors demonstrate that such post hoc concept erasure techniques are flawed and can be circumvented. They argue that these techniques essentially perform a form of input filtering, rendering them vulnerable to some more sophisticated text prompts. The authors introduce the \"Concept Inversion\" attack technique to recover erased concepts, effectively defeating seven recently announced hoc concept erasure methods across multiple use-cases. Their study calls into question the effectiveness of existing erasure methods and introduces a strong new evaluation methodology for future concept erasure research."

The experimental section of the article is detailed. The authors clearly expound on the principles behind the latest seven post hoc concept erasure methods and introduce adaptive concept inversion methods tailored for each. Each attack scenario is deeply analyzed, with proposed attack methods that are both clear and logical.\n\n3. The authors' concept inversion method is effective, successfully circumventing most of the advanced Post hoc concept erasure methods. Even in instances where they could not break the SLD-Max method, as depicted in Appendix Figure 9, they provide a reasonable explanation in Appendix B.5."

These assumptions are closer to a white-box setting. However, for most MLaaS (Machine Learning as a Service) platforms, attackers would not have access to the internal details of the model, let alone the ability to add new tokens to its dictionary for executing Concept Inversion attacks. The TRANSFERABILITY method outlined by the authors in Appendix 4.4 also seems to be non-transferable to a black-box environment due to the inability of the attacker to modify the model's internal dictionary. Therefore, the current CI attacks appear to still have limited effectiveness in a black-box setting."

Assumption 5 in section 3 appears inconsistent with a white-box setting, particularly when considering Assumption 4, which grants the adversary computational resources. It raises the question of why an adversary could not alter the weights of the \"erased\" model under these conditions.\n\n4. Regarding the practicality of the proposed attack method, it is important to note that widely-used public services such as Stability AI and DALL-E 3 do not currently accept text-embedding inputs to my knowledge. This may render the evaluation less critical, especially considering that existing methods effectively erase explicitly mentioned words. \n\n[1] Kumari et al., Ablating Concepts in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models ICCV 2023"

A detailed discussion section on this will be useful and make the paper stronger."
