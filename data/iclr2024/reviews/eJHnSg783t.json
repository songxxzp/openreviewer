These would be more of a benchmark on the FEM-MPM-PBD simulation, but this could nevertheless broaden the applicability of the framework.\n2. How does the simulation compare when simulating articulated bodies? For example the lid-opening task, is the hinge a soft body or a joint? How well does this compare to modeling real-world objects?\n3. Adding some runtime reports, at least in the appendix, would be appreciated from a practitioner's perspective, since the choice for using FEM only for the sensor likely stems from high accuracy but high computational complexity as well. Hence MPM or PBD was used to simplify object simulation, is this correct? If so, it would be interesting to see how expensive each part of the simulation is, where simplifications are necessary when used in practice. Were any of the learned grasping or manipulation policies applied on the real robot?\n4. Continuing on the topic of runtimes, for the trajectory optimization tasks in manipulation, it would be interesting to see how many iterations/computational resources each method was given to converge, was it the same for each, or was each method run until convergence?"

In optical simulation, the visual quality of the optical simulation is examined. In grasping, the task is to use a parallel jaw gripper equipped with tactile sensors to see if tactile feedback is helpful. Finally in manipulation, four tasks are performed: surface following, cable straightening, case opening, and object reposing."

It\u2019s not labeled) is much larger than the differences between the different methods, including the random method. This is rather concerning, as it seems to indicate that the system identification method is not very effective at reducing the sim-to-real gap.\n- Rather than a comparison between using or not using tactile sensing for grasping, which has been validated in prior works, or comparison between different methods for optimizing policies to solve the manipulation tasks, I wish the paper focused more on evaluating how realistic and accurate the tactile sensing simulation is, as well as sim to real applications. I think those are the things that will really impact whether or not practitioners can rely on this simulator to generate conclusions that will hold in the real world.\n- The organization of the paper is slightly confusing: I think it would be easier to understand if the tasks were introduced closer in the text to where the results are presented. In general I think the clarity of the writing could be improved, for example, to be more explicit about when tactile signals are real or simulated (for example, in Section 4.2, is the training data real?)"

What are the failure modes?\n- (nit): I recommend adding periods after paragraph section headings or otherwise distinguishing them from the following text.\n- (nit): For the \u201cexperimental results\u201d on page 9: \u201cFor case opening and object reposing, we define the metric as the opened angle of the lid and the orientation of the object.\u201d I think it\u2019s not quite accurate to refer to the orientation of the object as a metric."
