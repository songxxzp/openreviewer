                "value": "Primary Concerns:\n\nNovelty. My main reservation pertains to the novelty made over the work by Wang & Wu (2023). While I concede that the task depicted here is more realistic than that in Wang & Wu (2023), it appears the core insights remain consistent: FCNs are equivalent to global rotation groups, whereas LCNs relate to local rotation/permutation groups. Although the authors consider optimization in the upper bound analysis for LCNs and CNNs, the chosen algorithm, which has just two training iterations, seems quite unconventional and perhaps too simplistic. I'm uncertain whether this presents an improvement relative to the ERM analysis. Regarding the lower bound section, if I interpret it correctly, does the novelty lie mostly in the technical novelty? It appears that the primary objective is to determine the size of the enlarged function class, when the original task is enlarged by the global/local rotation group. I question the significance of the specific method used for this calculation. My primary concern remains to be the novelty over Wang & Wu (2023). If clarity on this point is provided, I'm inclined to upgrade my rating to at least 6. Moreover, it would be beneficial if the paper could elaborate more on the contributions of Wang & Wu (2023) and comparisons with Wang & Wu (2023). For instance, when stating on page 2, \"Wang & Wu (2023) extended this line of work to show a separation between FCNs, LCNs and CNNs. However, that work suffer from the same drawbacks as Li et al. (2021).\", a more explicit discussion on the advancements and remaining problems in Wang & Wu (2023) would be useful.\n\nSecondary Concerns:\n\n1. Regarding the model definitions, what is the reason for limiting the norm of $w_i$ to less than one? This seems implausible.\n2. What necessitates the width of your FCN models to be defined as $k$? Shouldn't the lower bound be applicable to any width, at least intuitively?\n3. Concerning the proof outline for theorem 6.1, in its first step, could there be an inclusion of a more comprehensive technical elaboration? While some readers might be able to grasp its logic intuitively, offering a detailed technical justification, especially given its novel approach, would be beneficial."

It seems that the problem setup is precise enough to run small experiments on the linear models outlined in section 4.2. \n\nFor example, for a fixed amount of $sigma$ and $d$, each linear model can be trained on an increasing number of classes to show the empirical observation of the $k$ term. Similarly, this can also be shown with a fixed $sigma$ and $k$. This is just the first example of what came to mind, but the authors may indeed be able to come up with an even better experiment given their study of the problem.\n \nIf this can be added, I would be happy to raise my score. \n\n## Minor:\n\nAfter the conclusion, there is a QED symbol which is likely a typo and should have appeared after the previous section."

For example, in section 6, 'we establish that learning U \u25e6 DSD with m samples requires learning k \"nearly independent\" subtasks,' and in section 7, 'we establish that learning U \u25e6 DSD with m samples requires learning k independent subtasks.' Dose this result in the difference between the sample complexity of LCNs in section 6 and 7? If this is the case, I think authors could add more analysis regarding how the results will change given the learning setting of 'U \u25e6 DSD', In addition, is there a setting where the sample complexity of FCNs, LCNs and CNNs is similar?

The authors prove lower bounds on the sample complexity of FCNs and LCNs, and similarly demonstrate upper bounds on the sample complexities of LCNs and CNNs to draw firm conclusions under the assumptions made in their theory.\n\nTo carry out the analysis, the paper proposed a toy data model inspired from the concepts of locality and translation invariance in natural images, called the Dynamic Signal Distribution (DSD) task. Here the input is comprised of k consecutive patches of dimension d, and one of the k patches is randomly filled with a noisy signed signal, while remaining patches are filled with isotropic Gaussian noise.

To the best of my knowledge, the proposed DSD model is novel, and the derived lower bounds are enabled by taking the learning algorithm (gradient descent) into account. This is necessary since a learning algorithm can simulate CNNs with LCNs and FCNs. While previous works have established a sample complexity separation when assuming training with gradient descent, they used a data model which did not seek to capture translation invariance and locality."
