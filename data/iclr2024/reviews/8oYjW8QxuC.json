The paper points out that PI-based methods underperform compared to no-PI-based methods. However, it fails to delve deep into the underlying principles causing this discrepancy. The conclusions seem to be drawn mainly from some experimental verifications rather than in-depth analysis.\n\n2. The experimental comparisons are not exhaustive. Several state-of-the-art methods mentioned in Table 1, such as dividemix, weren't comparatively analyzed in the experiments. Given that Pi-Dual incorporates additional information to tackle label noise, comparing it with the current best methods is crucial to gauge the algorithm's effectiveness.\n\n3. Certain ablation studies were not conducted, like the choice of the model backbone and parameters of the additional PI-related modules."

While this approach provides some technical novelty, it may be considered somewhat limited.\n\n- I find the experimental results to be somewhat perplexing. It is reasonable that PI-DUAL doesn't need to be compared to two-stage methods like DivideMix or other semi-supervised pipelines. However, the test accuracy presented in Table 2 exhibits a notable gap compared to the results reported in the original papers or public leaderboards [R2]. Additionally, the test accuracy for TRAM on CIFAR-10N, as presented in the original paper, was 71.8, but in Table 2, it's only 64.9. While I acknowledge that differences in training settings may account for this, it would be beneficial to conduct specific experiments to compare each method under their optimal configurations.\n\n- Typos:\n    - In Section 3.2: Change \"Here, $\\gamma_{\\phi}$ denotes\" to \"Here, $\\gamma_{\\psi}$ denotes.\"\n\n[R1] Transfer and Marginalize: Explaining Away Label Noise with Privileged Information\n\n[R2] You can access the relevant information at http://www.noisylabels.com."

Second, they implement a bidirectional gated output logic structure that decomposes the output logic into a predictive term based on regular input features and a noise-adapted term influenced only by PI. Finally, a PI-driven gating mechanism adaptively chooses between the predictive term and the noise-adaptation term to handle clean and mislabeled learning paths, respectively. \nSecond, from a significance perspective, the results are impressive, and the improvement of the proposed methods is significant.
