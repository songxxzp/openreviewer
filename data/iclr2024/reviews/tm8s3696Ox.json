As a result, it is difficult to judge if the method is indeed OFL. The evaluation is thorough, but if it is not conducted when the clients' models are trained only once, then I have serious concerns about what the paper is claiming and how the experiments are conducted.\n\nSection 3.2 is extremely hard to follow and lacks structure. It is unclear whether the data is generated on the fly during the training of the server model or if it is pregenerated.\n\nAlgorithm 1 does not provide any useful information beyond what has already been described in earlier sections. Please highlight what happens on the server and what happens on the client device. If it is truly OFL, what does the epoch correspond to? Is it the server model training? This question also relates to Figure 1 (a) and (d). If there are multiple epochs of both the client and server, how is it considered OFL?"

If the synthesized samples are hard to fit by the ensemble, why make it even more harder for the server model to learn by introducing adversarial samples? \n\nWhat kind of issues arise when one has multi-round FL? This question is related to the following statement: \"mitigating errors arising from multi-round.\" Is OFL a silver bullet? when it can fail ? Please explain in Limitation section to better contextualize when using OFL is useful. \n\nWhere does the generator G(\u00b7) come from? What is the architecture, and how is it trained? It is completely unclear how data is generated for knowledge distillation eq. 4 to train the server model. I suggest the authors write a separate section explaining it in detail since it is a main component of the proposed method. Is it pure random noise? If yes, why not use [1]?\n\nHow does Co-Boosting not require model transmission? From eq. 2, it seems like the ensemble is created with FedAvg in a single round. But as per section 3.3, the ensemble is not created by weighted averaging of client models? Is that correct? So logits are averaged on synthetic data, which acts as an ensemble for the server model, what is correct?\n\nWhat is GHM? Please provide the full form and a minimal description to improve the readability of the paper. There are already too many references/links to prior work and moving back and forth makes it hard to follow the method.  In eq. 5, does $\\bf{x}$ represent a synthetic sample?\n\nRegarding the statement \"searching for the optimal ensembling weights of each client's logits,\" it is unclear how the search is performed.\n\n[1] Baradad Jurjo, Manel, et al. \"Learning to see by looking at noise.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 2556-2569."

When training the generator, utilizing the output of the ensemble model to calculate the difficulty of samples, assigning higher loss function weights to hard samples.

The one-shot federated learning encompasses various types of methods, including training generators [DENSE, FedDF], uploading distilled datasets [1], utilizing existing pre-trained models [2], and so on. However, this paper specifically focuses on methods related to training generators. This point should be clearly discussed in the introduction and related work sections.\n3. The experiments are insufficient. The most complex model architecture discussed in this paper is a 5-layer CNN, and the most complex dataset is CIFAR100. This raises doubts about the practical value of this one-shot method.\n4. In the experimental section, this paper focuses on class distribution. However, this alone may not be sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This is because when there are differences in class distribution, the weights of the ensemble model will naturally play a crucial role. For instance, if a model does not support category 'a', it would be necessary to reduce the weight assigned to this model. I would recommend the authors to incorporate experiments involving feature distribution differences, for instance, by utilizing the DomainNet dataset.\n\n[1] Zhou, Yanlin, et al. \"Distilled one-shot federated learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.07999 (2020).\n\n[2] Yang, Mingzhao, et al. \"Exploring One-shot Semi-supervised Federated Learning with A Pre-trained Diffusion Model.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.04063 (2023)."
