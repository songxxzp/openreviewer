This problem has been extensively studied, and several first- and second-order methods have been developed. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a second-order algorithm for sparse phase retrieval. The cost per iteration is $\\tilde{O}(s^4+s^2n^2)$, and the number of iterations is $\\log \\log (1/\\epsilon)+\\log (\\|x\\|/x_{\\min})$. The algorithm also considers noisy measurements and proves a linear convergence rate. Additionally, the paper conducts several experiments in different parameter regimes and compares the new algorithm's performance with previous algorithms. The experimental results show that the new algorithm has significant advantages in efficiency, accuracy, and robustness."

The new fast algorithm proposed here can be utilized for a variety of real-world applications. Theoretically, the time complexity for each iteration of the algorithm matches the previous state-of-the-art first-order method, while the number of iterations improves on all previous first- and second-order methods. This is an essential theoretical improvement. Empirically, the proposed algorithm can be efficiently implemented and runs very fast and robustly. Furthermore, this paper is well-written, and most statements appear to be mathematically sound to me."

The main text of this paper does not provide enough intuition for why this initialization is necessary. Second, the initial point of the iterative method is generated via the sparse spectral initialization method by Jagatap and Hegde (2019). This makes the whole algorithm quite complicated. Third, it is unclear what are the technical differences between this paper and the papers by Cai et al. (2016) and Cai et al. (2022). It seems that the proofs in this paper rely on several technical lemmas from previous works."

Page 2, bullet 2: \u201cIt is important to emphasize\u2026\u201d Note that the non-asymptotic convergence of Newton's methods has been studied in many optimization problems in theoretical computer science and optimization. It is indeed interesting to obtain an iteration bound for the sparse phase retrieval problem. But this emphasis seems to be unnecessary.\n3. Page 3, Sec. 2.1: the formulation of the problem is unclear. For example, are the sensing vectors $a_i$ fixed or chosen by the algorithm?\n4. Table 1: it would be better to add references to these methods.\n5. Is there any lower bound on the computation complexity of this problem? \n6. Page 4, Sec. 3.1: $O(n^3)$ can be replaced with $n^{\\omega}$ using fast matrix multiplication since you are referring to the complexity. \n7. Page 4: \u201cWe identify the set of free variables using one-step IHT\u201d, IHT is not defined.\n8. Eq. (4): is there a closed-form expression for the s-sparse hard thresholding? Does it just pick the s largest magnitude entries of the input vector?\n9. Bottom of Page 4: is there any intuition as to why using f_A for free variable identification can improve the algorithm? \n10. Thm. 3.1: \u201c There exists positive constant\u201d -> \u201c exist\u201d\n11. Thm. 3.1: what is the convergence rate of the first K iterations?\n12. Thm. 3.1: what\u2019s the scale of $\\rho$? Is it smaller than 1 or bigger than 1?\n13. Thm 3.2: in this theorem, the convergence rate is characterized for the first K iteration. Why is this different from the noiseless case? Does it mean the algorithm is not robust in a long time?\n14. Lem. B.2: Does $A_S$ mean the principal sub-matrix indexed by $S$? Or does it only include the rows in $S$? How tight is this lemma?\n15. Lem. B.4: why $r=s$ and $s\u2019$? Is it a typo here? Also, what is $\\delta_{s+s\u2019}$?\n16. Lem. B.7: $\\mathcal{T}$ is not defined here.\n17. Eq. (29): it would be better to recall what is $p$ here.\n18. Proof of Thm 3.1: It actually shows a linear convergence rate for the first K iterations. After that, the support of the ground-truth vector is fixed, and the quadratic convergence appears. It seems that in the fast-convergence phase, the algorithm uses Newton\u2019s method to solve a general phase retrieval problem (without sparsity) of dimension $s$. Is the quadratic convergence rate known before for this problem?"
