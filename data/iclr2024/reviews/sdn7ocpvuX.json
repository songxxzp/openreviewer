                "value": "1. I have some big concerns about this paper, especially when looking at the starting Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 in the paper. The authors say that changes in the graph structure affect the graph neural diffusion model a lot. But I don't think they've given enough proof for this, especially when I compare it to what's said in the paper [1]. \\\nIn Proposition 1's proof, they say that $\\tilde{A'}$ and $\\tilde{A}$ can be swapped around (are commutative), **but that's not always true**. The whole point of Proposition 1 seems to depend on this being right. If it's not right, then Proposition 1 doesn't work. This makes me question the other things the paper says. \\\nAlso, even if we say that their assumption is right, the result they get seems too general. **It's not as specific as the conclusion in the Proposition 1 of the paper [1]**. Proposition 2 also uses the same kind of reasoning as Proposition 1.\\\nThe proofs in the paper have one fundamental flaw that leads to incorrect equations.  For instance, in many equations (Eg. Eq(40), (58), (60), (63), (64), (76) etc.), it uses $e^(X+Y) = e^Xe^Y$ **without considering the commutative between $X$ and $Y$.** \\\nBecause of these problems, especially the mistake in Proposition 1, I don't think this paper should be accepted as it is. They need to go back, check their work and related works such as [1][9], and make it clearer.  \n2. **Equation (73) in the proof of Proposition 3 is incorrect.** The validity of Equation (73) requires that **$\\cal{H}$ be a finite hypothesis class and the loss function $l$ be bounded within $[0,1]$.** Specifically, the penultimate inequality in Equation (73) holds only if $\\cal{H}$ is finite, and the last inequality is true when the loss function $l$ is bounded in $[0,1]$. However, this paper does not fulfill the required conditions: the hypothesis class $\\cal{H}$  is not finite as it involves neural networks, and the loss functions used like cross-entropy or MSE are not bounded between $[0,1]$. As a result, the conclusions drawn in Proposition 3 are incorrect. **This issue also affects Equation (85) in the proof of Theorem 2, leading to incorrect in the Theorem 2 conclusions.**  In conclusion, the main claim of this paper, Theorem 2, rests on the incorrect assumption. This error is critical enough to question the entire paper's validity, making its findings untrustworthy.\n3. Using Advective Diffusion Equations in GNNs is not new, see the related works such as [2] and [3].  \n4. This paper also lacks a comparison and citation of related works, particularly those focusing on the generalization of topology distribution shift based on the graphon theory, such as references [6] and [7].  \n5. Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 hold under the data generation hypothesis in Sec. 3.1. How does this data generation hypothesis correspond to the real-world datasets in Sec. 5.2? The citations of the graphon theory are not given in Sec. 3.1. Can you explain more about the graphon?  \n6. In the proof of Theorem 1, why $C=\\bar{C}+m log(I + \\tilde{A}) - \\beta \\tilde{A}$ ?   \n7. For the model implementation in Section 4.3, why have approximation techniques been chosen over the numerical solvers proposed in [4], which are commonly utilized in graph neural diffusion models such as GRAND, GRAND++, GraphCON[8], CDE[3], as well as GREAD[5] models? Have any ablation studies been conducted to compare the effectiveness of different numerical solvers?  \n8. Why are there no results for ADIT-INVERSE in Table 1? Additionally, the results for ADIT-SERIES show only marginal improvement compared to GRAND. It would be beneficial to include more baselines of graph neural diffusion models, such as the model in [1][9] and GraphCON, for a more comprehensive comparison.  \n9.
