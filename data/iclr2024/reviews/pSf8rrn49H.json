Notably, many contemporary generative models face issues of infringement, as some artists are reluctant to have their work used in training such models. The authors introduce a dual-phase approach: the LoRA fine-tuning stage for concept elimination, followed by a memory stage to enhance generation quality for non-infringing images. The paper mainly evaluates the proposed method on well-defined concepts such as Picasso and Mickey."

These basic operations are expected to give good incentives to each participant in the market and enable enough flexibility to thrive in the market. Then, an inverse LoRA approach is adopted to instantiate the extraction operation and a data-free layer-wise distillation is used to combine the multiple extractions or additions. The experiments conducted for style transfer and cartoon IP recreation demonstrate the effectiveness to extent of the proposed method."

As illustrated in the abstract, the framework aims to address the tension between the users, the content creators and the generative models. However, there are no figures, workflow or formulation that strictly define and describe how the proposed model interacts with these roles.\n2. Most components to construct the model are widely adopted. What are the real merits of the work?\n3. The design of the three operations feels quite ad hoc, and there is no explanation as to why these three operations precisely address the problem. Whether these three operations form a complete set or can represent all possible operations remains unanswered. It seems that some potential points have been mentioned rather cursorily, and there hasn't been a comprehensive exploration of this issue."

Given limited quantitative results and comparisons, it would be helpful to see a diverse set of qualitative results. Also, I see that the paper mentions human evaluation in page 7, but doesn\u2019t present any human eval results. I feel human eval results further help in justifying the proposed framework."
