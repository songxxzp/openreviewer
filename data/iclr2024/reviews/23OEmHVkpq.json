We suggest the authors to \u201cmove\u201d the gradient orthogonalization part to the main paper.\n\n2. As the authors explained, the RTD was defined in a previous work, but we believe it is important to be defined in the main paper.\n\n3. In section 4.1, bullets (2-4). In (2), g\\inG appears to be applied to both pixel and latent space. Later in (3,4), where decomposition G is defined, it seems that it can be applied only in the latent space. We believe the authors should re-write this part, clarifying how G can be applied in the pixel space or, if that is not the case remove from (2) the application of g in the pixel space.\n\n4. In equation (4) regularization parameter /gamma is defined. Later in the appendix Q, \\gamma_1, and \\gamma_2 are used in the ablation table. Does this correspond, instead, to the loss: \\gamma_1 L_{VAE-based} + \\gamma_2 L_{TD}.\n\n5. In page 5 footnote, the authors state that RPT can be computed in latent space instead of pixel space. Can the authors provide ablations in the appendix exploring this direction? Do the authors have insights into how this change can affect the final trained model?\n\n6. Finally, our main concern is whether the proposed regularizer contributes to the learning of the disentangled representation or the used base models (i.e., \\beta-VAE, Factor-VAE). Since, in the main paper, only the models with already disentanglement remedies are explored and not the vanilla VAE. More concerning in the ablation, VAE+TopDis is explored, but it seems that the training is not the same as the VAE reported in the main paper. Our guess is that the models in the ablation were trained for less number of iterations. We encourage the authors to include in the main paper VAE+TopDis trained under the same conditions (i.e. same number of iterations) as the reported VAE in Table 1. This will help readers understand to what extent the TopDis regularizer helps learn disentangled representations"
