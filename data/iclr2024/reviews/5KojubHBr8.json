                "value": "The paper introduces an interleaved image-text dataset built upon public VQA/captioning/Reasoning datasets such as Flickr/VQAv2/MSRVTT. It proposes several schemes to convert existing datasets into interleaved-image-text formats. The proposed dataset is used to train a VQA model that can take multiple images as input to answer questions (following user instructions). It shows state-of-the-art results on recent VQA benchmarks such as MME/MMBench, and demonstrated ability to improve downstream task performance using few-shot image-text samples. However, the writing of this paper is extremely bad, consisting of numerous typos, grammatical mistakes, and sentences that are difficult to understand. There are lots of missing details regarding dataset curation and evaluation protocols."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "First, I find it **extremely hard to follow the methodology** in this paper. For example, as dataset curation is one of the most important contributions of this work, I am not able to understand what efforts the authors put in order to gather a massive 5.8M interleaved-image-text datasets. For instance, Could you explain how you manage to collect the sample as shown in Figure 3(b) and 4? In these two figures, it is shown two people quarreling with each other; this requires the original dataset to not just have bounding boxes for person1 and person2, but also the action relation (quarreling) between these two bounding boxes. I would appreciate if the authors could point us to the actual dataset used to gather this particular example, and explain if extra (and perhaps costly) human annotation is required to get such samples.\n\nThe authors should also provide more visual examples from each dataset and more detailed description on how you convert them into instruction-following formats. For example, the current Section 2.3 is very hard to understand. It says *\u201cNext, we employ ChatGPT to rewrite the instructions to describe the key characteristics of each task accurately\u201d* \u2014 what does it mean by *\u201ckey characteristics of each task\u201d* and how did ChatGPT come up with them?\n\nThere are **lots of missing details** regarding model evaluation. \u2028\n\n- For one example, in Table 4, how did the authors select the few-shot samples? Will different few-shot samples affect the performance? No variance/std is provided in Table4.\n\n- How did you manually split ScienceQA-IMG into two groups that require images or not? Did you hire human annotators for this task? What rationales did the annotators employ?\n\n- Table 8 shows that Flickr/VQAv2 are used in your training set. Then how could Table 4 claim that your model achieves good \u201czero-shot\u201d and \u201cfew-shot\u201d performance on Flickr/VQAv2?\n\n- Table 8 attempted to show the licenses for all training datasets, but almost half are labeled with \u201cUnknown\u201d license. This is counter-intuitive because some widely used datasets such as Flickr have well-documented licenses listed on their websites. \n\n- Do you use the same datasets during both stage-1 and stage-2 pre-training?\n\n- As you show on Table 8, Winoground only has 800 samples. How could there be an image score of 44.99?\n\nFinally, it is unclear if the performance boost really comes from having more interleaved-image-text data, because the current paper does not perform ablation on the selection of training data.\n\nThe paper has way too many typos. To list a few:\n- Figure 1: missing a white space \u201cMMICLtypically\u201d.\n- Page 2: fall should be fail? \u201ctheir context schemes fall to\u201d\n- Page 3: missing a period \u201cmultiple images In Fig. 2.b\u201d\n- Figure 3: missing a period \u201cunified format\u201d\n- Page 4: missing a white space \u201cMMICLin\u201d\n- Page 8: hinds or hints \u201cprovide hinds\u201d"

                "value": "# Summary\nThe paper introduces MMICL (Multi-modal In-Context Learning), a novel approach designed to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding complex multi-modal prompts, which include multiple images and text. The authors highlight that while Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in in-context learning from text prompts, VLMs lag behind, especially when dealing with prompts that involve intricate text-to-image references and relationships among multiple images. To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes a new context scheme that includes an image declaration section and image proxy tokens to improve the in-context learning capabilities of VLMs. Additionally, the authors have constructed a new dataset tailored to train VLMs on complex multi-modal prompts. The experimental results suggest that MMICL sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot performance on various vision-language tasks and benchmarks, demonstrating a significant improvement in understanding text-to-image references and relationships between images. MMICL also shows a reduction in language bias, which often leads VLMs to overlook visual content."

On MME, MMICL seems to achieve the best average scores compared with current VLMs on cognition and perception tasks, indicating a strong performance. On MMBench, they also achieved SOTA performance which demonstrate the prominent ability of MMICL.\n\n3. **Reduction in Language Bias:** MMICL reduces the chances of VLMs ignoring visual content, which is crucial for accurate multi-modal reasoning. Their experiments provided promising results."

                "value": "# Weaknesses\n\nAlthough I can spot many advantages in MMICL and I truly believe its a wonderful model. This paper also did a lot of experiments to demonstrate its ability. But here I should address few weaknesses and the authors should better clarify it to make the work's claims more sound.\n\n1. The paper emphasizes the use of interleaved image-text data pairs and in-context learning data for training, suggesting this approach is beneficial for understanding complex multi-modal prompts. However, without experimental comparisons, it's unclear if interleaved pairs offer a substantial advantage over single image-text pairs. It's possible that similar results could be achieved without the interleaved structure. The authors should clarify whether the interleaved structure is a key contributor to performance improvements or if it primarily serves to enhance demonstrations and applicability to real-world scenarios.\n\n2. The paper's focus on MME and MMBench, which involve fixed-format questions, might not fully represent the model's ability to handle freeform answers. Benchmarks like MM-VET[1], which require freeform answers and are evaluated by GPT-4, could provide a different perspective on the model's capabilities. A more diverse set of benchmarks, including those requiring freeform answers, would offer a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and generalizability.\n\n3. The paper does not fully discuss why MMICL's architecture is superior to the Flamingo or other paradigms[2] or other existing methods, which leaves the comparison incomplete. Many claims and designs in Section 2.1/2.2 seems just the author's considerations and are lacking sufficient reasons. Although conducting more comparative experiments may be challenging, the author should at least provide more explanations in these aspects to make the arguments in this paper more substantial. Instead of presenting a final result by combining all designs together, the author should provide further explanations to justify their choices.\n\nFor the dataset and training methodology to be validated, the authors should ideally show that the interleaved image-text pairs lead to better model performance than traditional single image-text pairs, across a range of tasks that include both fixed-format and freeform response requirements. Additionally, the paper should discuss any limitations of the proposed methods, such as potential overfitting to a specific data structure or benchmark, to provide a balanced and transparent evaluation of the approach.\n\n[1] Yu, Weihao, et al. \"Mm-vet: Evaluating large multimodal models for integrated capabilities.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.02490 (2023).\n\n[2] Yao, Zhewei, et al. \"DeepSpeed-VisualChat: Multi-Round Multi-Image Interleave Chat via Multi-Modal Causal Attention.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.14327 (2023)."

Why using interleaved image-text data for instruction tuning an VLM would be considered beneficial? In terms of the model performance, is there any experimental comparison to support this claim?\n\n2. Is there any quantitative results to support the models ability in free-form answering (evaluated by GPT-4)?\n\n3. Why the MMICL's design is better for image-text interleaved chatting than Flamingo-based or other architectures?"
