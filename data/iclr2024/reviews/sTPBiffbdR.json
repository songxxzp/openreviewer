However, recent advanced pseudo-labeling algorithms heavily rely on the data augmentation available for a domain, e.g. images, speech and text, to achieve state-of-the-art results. In this paper authors propose variant of pseudo-labeling, dubbed DAST, which is agnostic to a domain and does not rely on the augmentation. Instead, DAST performs joint cross-entropy and contrastive loss training with pseudo-labels generated by the other head of the network for each loss, emulating EM algorithms and forcing minimization of intraclass distance in the representation clustering. Authors show this EM intuition and provide theoretical justification behind it. With empirical results authors compare DAST with prior methods on tabular data where augmentation is not readily available as well as on graph and image data where augmentation can be incorporated into DAST too. Results show that DAST outperforms domain-agnostic, domain-specific and contrastive methods."

The latter is the simplest domain agnostic method which works well in practice in many domains, including tabular data. This distinction between methods is needed as they have different training dynamic and different problems (e.g. it was shown recently that FixMatch can diverge for transformer-based models in vision  Cai, Z., Ravichandran, A., Favaro, P., Wang, M., Modolo, D., Bhotika, R., ... & Soatto, S. (2022). Semi-supervised vision transformers at scale. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, 25697-25710.)\n- There is no comparison with plain teacher-student baseline to understand if the issue of all continuous methods is exactly data augmentation and /or continuous nature of training. \n- There is no detailed disambiguation in the proposed method between cross-entropy loss with pseudo-labels and contrastive loss, e.g. what is the quality of supervised training when contrastive loss is not used or is used, what about other methods when contrastive loss is added? Does improvement come from additional contrastive loss or from new scheme of pseudo-labels cross usage? (Table 8 only partially answers these questions, and then you need to compare with self-supervised + self-training methods as a baseline).\n- In the projection head, pseudo-labels updating is proposed to do every T steps. Authors did not study how this affects training stability. Could it be that this step is \"must\" for the training, as otherwise both pseudo-labels in E and M steps are changing too fast causing divergence as in prior works, e.g. Cai, Z., et al. Semi-supervised vision transformers at scale. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, 25697-25710 or Likhomanenko, T, et al. \"slimipl: Language-model-free iterative pseudo-labeling.\" Interspeech 2021?\n- Errors in the proof of Theorem 1: \n  - second part of the last part of eq (14) is wrong, there should be log sum exp operation\n  - in eq (16) first row: there is missing |S_j|\n  - why data embeddings are on the hypersphere?

Initial statement should be smoother then.\n- In the text I feel overstatement of error propagation, as now it is indirect and more complicated dependency could be on error propagation if any part of the algorithm is broken (e.g. if contrastive part is broken).\n- Label propagation is not clearly articulated in the text. Formulas are good, but some description what exactly is behind these formulas will be helpful, especially due to usage of classification head pseudo-labels in this process.\n- Table 1: why contrastive is worse than supervised training with labeled data only?\n- Does DAST work better in low data regime as shown in the paper? What happens with larger data regime as maybe contrastive is not so helpful there?\n- SimCLR results in Table 3 are very poor compared to the original paper, why is it?\n- In Table 13: are all boosting methods trained in fully supervised regime?\n- Additional citation to check https://openreview.net/forum?id=TAVBJ4aHsWt"
