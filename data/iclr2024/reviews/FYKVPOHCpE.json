                "value": "The paper introduces a novel approach to non-transferable learning (NTL) that focuses on disentangling content and style factors, harnessing them as guidance for improved non-transferable representation learning. The concept of separating content and style for NTL is innovative and not commonly explored in existing literature. This approach presents a fresh perspective on NTL that has the potential to address the limitations of previous statistical methods. The novelty of this concept makes the paper stand out."

                "value": "1. The paper is technically sound and demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the issues in NTL. It effectively presents a causal model to explain non-transferable learning and provides a well-structured method to address these issues. The utilization of a variational inference framework for disentanglement and dual-path knowledge distillation for learning non-transferable representations is well-reasoned and technically sound.\n\n2. The paper is well-organized and clearly written. It provides a coherent and logical progression from the problem statement to the proposed solution. The use of illustrative figures and the clear description of the causal model enhance the paper's overall clarity. However, the high complexity of the method and the underlying theoretical framework might make it challenging for some readers. To enhance clarity, it would be helpful to include examples or case studies illustrating the practical application of the method.\n\n3. The paper is significant in the context of non-transferable learning. It offers a promising approach that addresses the limitations of previous methods, particularly the challenges related to statistical dependence between source and target domains. The disentanglement of content and style factors is an important contribution as it aligns with human-like understanding and, as demonstrated through experiments, improves NTL performance. The potential impact on the AI research community lies in its ability to advance the field of NTL, making it more effective and practical."

The paper is generally well-structured, but it could benefit from the inclusion of practical examples or use cases to demonstrate the application of the proposed method.\n\n2. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of H-NTL over competing methods, which is a significant point in favor of the paper's claims. It would be helpful to include discussions on potential real-world applications where H-NTL could be particularly valuable.\n\n3. The introduction could be more concise and direct, focusing on the problem and motivation for the proposed approach.\n\n4. Minor grammatical and typographical errors should be addressed for a more polished final version.\n\n5. Including discussions on potential limitations and areas for future research could provide a more well-rounded view of the work."
