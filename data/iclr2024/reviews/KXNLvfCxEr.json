                "value": "This paper presents a method of model-based imitation learning based on learning and evolution. Specifically, the proposed method named EvIL is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem. The outer loop optimizes the reward and transition functions that are used to train a policy by reinforcement learning in the inner loop. The objective function of the outer loop is behavioral cloning loss, and CMA-ES is adopted to optimize the reward and transition functions. The evolved reward function is distilled to simplify the network architecture of the reward function, which improves the performance in the test environment. EvIL is evaluated on Gridworld and Reacher and outperforms BC and AIRL."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The literature review is insufficient. For example, the structure of EvIL is similar to the framework of learning and evolution. For example, Elfwing et al. (2018) optimize hyperparameters of RL by a simple evolutionary algorithm in the outer loop while the policy is trained by RL. In Nielum et al. (2010), the reward function is optimized by genetic programming. Please discuss the relation between EvIL and these classical studies. In addition, a more detailed survey on meta-learning is needed. For example, Evolved Policy Gradient (Houthooft et al., 2018) optimizes a differentiable loss function, where a similar evolutionary strategy is used in the outer loop.\nS. Niekum et al. (2010). Genetic Programming for Reward Function Search. IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development. 2(2): 83-90. \nS. Elfwing et al. (2018). Online Meta-Learning by Parallel Algorithm Competition. In Proc. of GECCO.  \nR. Houthooft et al. (2018). Evolved Policy Gradients. NeurIPS. \n\nMy second concern is the scalability of the algorithm. Since a naive evolutionary strategy is adopted to optimize the reward and transition functions, applying the proposed method to problems with a high-dimensional state space is problematic. \n\nFinally, it would be better to re-organize Section 5 because Figure 3 is explained after Figure 2."

                "value": "1. Figure 1 seems interesting, but I do not fully understand the experimental conditions. The first paragraph of Section 4.1 mentions that the reward function optimized in the training environment is used to train policies in the test environment. However, Figure 1 shows that the reward and transition functions are optimized in the test environment. Please clarify the motivation for the experiments. \n2. Figure 1 shows that the performance of EvIL is worse than that of AIRL in the training environment. However, AIRL failed to improve its performance in the test environment. Does it imply that the initial reward is tuned for the training environment? \n3. Discussions about Figure 2 are needed. For example, in my view, there are no significant differences among EvIL, EvIL with supervised loss, and EvIL with supervised model. In addition, the performance in the online setting is much better than those of other methods. It implies that EvIL failed to find a good transition function even in the Poitmass environment. Would you discuss the quality of the optimized transition function in detail? \n4. Figure 3 is interesting, but I am unsure how the features such as the obstacle position are retrieved from the reward function. As far as I understand, the reward function is represented by a neural network, which is a mapping from a state to a scalar value. Would you clarify the method to retrieve the reward features?"
