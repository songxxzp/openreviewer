                "value": "This paper introduces a framework for unsupervised tree-based end-to-end learning. This framework combines tree structures with generalized mutual information for clustering, resulting in two approaches: KAURI and DOUGLAS. KAURI focuses on maximizing a kernel-KMeans-like objective to iteratively create unsupervised splits by assigning tree leaves to either existing or new clusters. On the other hand, DOUGLAS harnesses the power of differential trees and the Wasserstein distance. KAURI is more suitable for small-scale datasets, while DOUGLAS excels with larger datasets that have fewer features."

Although the proposed method is straightforward, it doesn't appear to offer a high degree of novelty. Consequently, the research's significance remains unclear.\n\nThe simplicity of the proposed method makes it particularly important to validate its effectiveness through numerical experiments. However, the descriptions of these experiments lack adequate detail. For instance:\n\n- The DOUGLAS experiment is said to be limited by memory constraints, but there is no information about the specific memory requirements or the machine resources used.\n- Performance metrics are mentioned, but the paper does not provide data on computational time and memory usage.\n- The Appendix notes that the batch size for the DOUGLAS experiments varies depending on the dataset, but it does not explain the methodology behind this decision. A comparison of the amount of parameter tuning against a benchmark is also needed for further validation.\n- In the Appendix, it's stated that the handling of categorical variables varies depending on the dataset. However, information is only provided for the US congressional votes dataset, affecting the experiment's reproducibility.\n\n(Minor comment: The capitalization of \"KAURI/Kauri\" and \"DOUGLAS/Douglas\" is inconsistent, and there is a lack of consistency in notation.)"

I would like to understand the rationale for using this research approach instead of traditional Kernel KMeans. While one example is provided in Appendix E, I also wondered if there might be cases where KAURI doesn't perform well conversely. I believe the clear difference lies in the fact that it is an end-to-end approach. What might be the motivation behind this choice?\n\n2: How do the experimental results vary when the temperature parameter $\\tau$ in Equation 9 is modified? Although the temperature is set to 0.1 throughout this paper, it is known that this parameter is crucial in the context of differentiable trees. (See Reference [1])\n\n3: Please provide information on the machine resources used, computation time, memory usage, and the amount of parameter tuning (See Weakness part).\n\n[1]: A Neural Tangent Kernel Perspective of Infinite Tree Ensembles, Kanoh&Sugiyama(2022), ICLR2022"

It is ultimately and under-specified property and its value is in the eye of the beholder. \n\nI agree that explain another clustering output using a decision tree leaves something to be desired in terms of elegance. But clusters are often used as a form of explanation, which raises the question why does one need to explain a clustering output to begin with? \n\nWhy are divisive or agglomerative methods not compared against? They can produce trees, albeit perhaps not with annotated internal nodes. Yet, WAD doesn't require such annotations, so they can be evaluated as the authors have done."

It adapts a recent clustering objective into the traditional CART-type greedy recursive partitioning algorithm to learn the axis-aligned tree (KAURI algorithm). And similarly with DOUGLAS algorithm, which just uses the existing differentiable deep neural decision trees.\n3) The paper attempts to motivate for the end-to-end learning of clustering trees rather than using existing clustering algorithm such as k-means as reference. However, both theoretically and experimentally the advantage of end-to-end learning has not been clearly demonstrated.\n4) The datasets used in experiments seem to be quite small. The largest contains 20k points in 10 dimensions. Having a dataset of at least MNIST-level size can help to show its scalability.\n5) Adjusted rand index measure used to compare the clustering performance is questionable. As far as I understand, adjusted rand index uses ground-truth class labels but clustering is an unsupervised problem.
