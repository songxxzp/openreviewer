                "value": "This paper proposes an acceleration method for diffusion-based molecular conformation generation models. The proposed method involves modifying the score-based model in coordinate space and applying multiplier to the discretization of the SDE. The first modification is motivated by an analysis of the relationship between scores in coordinate and distance spaces, while the second addresses score approximation errors. The proposed sampling technique is applied to two SE(3)-equivariant diffusion models, GeoDiff (Xu et al., 2022) and SDDiff (Zhou et al., 2023), and is compared to the annealed Langevin dynamics sampler. While the proposed sampler shows empirical advantages, the paper falls short in terms of justifying the modifications adequately, and the mathematical details are both lacking in rigor and difficult to follow. Without further elaboration on these details and their underlying motivation, the paper has yet to provide compelling evidence to demonstrate a substantial contribution."

                "value": "The argument presented in this paper relies on the assumption that the set of the valid distance matrices can be endowed with a manifold structure, as stated in Section 3.3: \u201cThe manifold of valid distance matrices is a proper sub-manifold of R_+^(n\u00d7n).\u201d Subsequently, the pushforward map d\u03c6 is employed to map the score functions from distance space to coordinate space. However, the construction of a manifold structure for distance matrices is not trivial, considering that not all \u201cdistance matrices\u201d are valid; they must satisfy conditions such as the triangle inequality. The authors should provide relevant references or mathematical construction to support the claims made in the paper.\n\tThe differential geometry arguments in the paper lack clarity. For example, the use of d\u03c6 in this paper is more of a \u201cproposal\u201d than a well-defined mathematical construct. Additionally, while d \u0303\u2208M and \u2207_d \u0303   log\u2061\u3016p_\u03c3 (d \u0303\u2502d)\u2208T_d \u0303  M\u3017, it is repeatedly \u201cassumed\u201d in the paper that d \u0303+\u2207_d \u0303   log\u2061\u3016p_\u03c3 (d \u0303\u2502d)\u2208T_d \u0303  M\u3017, even though the addition between elements of a manifold and its tangent space is not clearly defined.\n\tThe rationale behind the factor of 1/2(n-1) in eq 9 and the unnumbered equation on page 14 is not clear. Since this factor is directly related to the construction of the first modification (eqs 5 and 11), it should be thoroughly explained and justified. It would be better to clarify whether this factor is based on the \u201crescaling\u201d approximation illustrated in Figure 6.\n\tThe implications of the error bound analysis in Theorem 1 are not clear. At least, the analysis does not support the claim that the proposed solution in eq 9 is \u201coptimal\u201d, as a naive choice of C \u0302=C \u0303 (the original coordinates) would yield a tighter upper bound of f(d \u0302 )=\u03b4^2<(2n^2+n-1)/(2(n-1)^2 ) \u03b4^2 if n>1.\n\tIn Section 4.2, the authors assume that the prediction error of the score-based model is a random error leading to an incomplete time step. However, the model error incurred during the score matching training procedure is more likely to be systematic rather than random, i.e., the model error would depend on the input distances and time steps. Since the following analysis in Section 5.1 assumes a random noise scheme, the authors would need to discuss how the results generalize to the trained score-based models with systematic errors.\n\tWhile the method generates conformers of comparable quality to the 5000-step LD sampler, it would be beneficial to demonstrate that the quality is superior to the LD sampler with equivalent time steps. It would be helpful to compare the results with the LD sampler with a similar (~100) or somewhat larger (500 or 1000?) number of time steps in Table 1."

However, the SOTA method of conformation generation like Torsional Diffusion which operates on the hypertorus achieves much better performance than GeoDIFF which operates on Euclidean space. Moreover, the sampling process of Torsional Diffusion only needs 20 steps. Therefore, focusing on accelerating the sampling process of GeoDIFF/SDDiff seems meaningless.\n2. The contribution of the introduced two minor modifications is limited. The operations just introduced two coefficients into existing sampling methods[1] to compensate for the poor performance on the conformation generation task by using [1] directly. From the experiments, the proposed methods don't get surprising results.\n3. The paper is over-clams. The paper doesn\u2019t provide the theoretical results about the statement \u201cWe analyze current modeling methods in SE(3) (Shi et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023) and theoretically pose crucial mistakes shared in these methods, which inevitably bring about the failure of acceleration\u201d and don\u2019t give the reasons why the modification solve the theoretical problems. If the proposed modifications can solve the problems, at least it can be directly used to improve the existing sampling methods applied in (Shi et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023).\n4. The paper is not well-written. The paper hasn\u2019t explained clearly why the introduced two modifications can accelerate the sampling process significantly. For modification one, the introduced $degree_i$ can make the sparse conformation into a fully connected conformation. Why connected conformation can outperform sparse one? \n5. The proposed sampling method mainly improves the recall but gains worse performance in precision. Therefore, this method, which is only used for conformation generation, is not very practical.\n6. The experimental results of baseline GeoDiff are significantly lower than the results reported in the GeoDiff paper.\n\n[1] DPM-Solver: A Fast ODE Solver for Diffusion Probabilistic Model Sampling in Around 10 Steps"
