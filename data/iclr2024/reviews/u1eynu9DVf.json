                "value": "The paper presents a method for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in instruction tuned language models, by building an interpretable forecasting model that predicts which training examples will be forgotten during model refinement, and replaying these examples. The authors compare a logit-based approach, which predicts how token logits on a pretraining example change before and after the model sees the online learning example, and a representation-based approach, which directly predicts whether the online learning example will cause a pretraining example to become erroneous using the latent representations of each example. Although the logit-based approach is more directly interpretable, the representation-based approach is robustly stronger at forecasting as well as mitigating forgetting across various settings (tuning heads only vs. LORA vs. all weights, different types of models)."

How does one train a LM which maps inputs to h(x), where h(x) is supposed to model the gradient of the model at x wrt $\\theta$. I cannot find any details about this or some reference about this. \n- Authors should clarify in Table 1 that they are predicting a minority class of forgotten examples in a binary classification setting. Hence F1 scores lower than 50% still make sense. In general, the writeup is quite poor. \n- Poor empirical results on real large scale models : The proposed approach is heavily reliant on order 1 approximations of training dynamics, which do not hold true of large models as seen empirically. There are quite marginal gains of vanilla baseline of frequency based forgetting prediction on FLAN. Although I do thank the authors for acknowledging this fact, it still remains a major concern about efficacy and practicality of proposed approaches in the paper."
