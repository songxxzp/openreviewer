They examine zero-shot commonsense reasoning, reading comprehension, and few-shot learning capabilities, making the results more generalizable.\n* Outperforms Existing Methods: The paper shows that their method, Compresso, consistently outperforms the existing structured pruning baseline (LLM-Pruner) in all aspects and settings. This includes zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.\n* Efficiency: The method is efficient enough to be trained on 4 Nvidia V100 GPUs, which could be considered a relatively modest hardware setting for such large-scale models. This indicates that the method is not just effective but also practical.\n* Impact of Pruning Data: The ablation study indicates that the choice of dataset for the pruning process can greatly impact the effectiveness of the technique. This adds a new dimension to the study of model pruning and could be a valuable insight for future research."

This discrepancy makes the comparison with traditional pruned models somewhat skewed and potentially unfair.\nThe authors are encouraged to broaden their experimental scope to include other sparse patterns (e.g., unstructured and N:M sparse patterns) to further validate the efficiency of the pruning prompt.\nMinor Issues:\nCertain assertions within the paper lack sufficient backing. For instance, the claim \"To our knowledge, we are the first to apply instruction tuning to weight pruning\""
