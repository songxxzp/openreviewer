                "value": "When training a neural network with SGD, different solutions in the parameter space can be obtained. The linear connection between two different solutions is called Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC). One commonly used approach to achieve LMC is to align the neurons of two network parameters through parameter permutation after training so that they are in the same loss basin. However, the number of permutation matrices is very large, and it requires a lot of computation because it is post-hoc. Therefore, the authors propose Training-time Neuron Alignment by Partially Fixing Neurons (TNA-PFN), which can align neurons at training time to create LMC. TNA-PFN is a method that learns in the parameter subspace by fixing part of the network parameters as initialization, based on the hypothesis that learning a network in an effective subspace with less permutation symmetry can lower the LMC barrier between trained networks. The authors support this hypothesis through both theoretical and experimental results. Also, the authors propose two algorithms, FedPFN and FedPNU, which adapt TNA-PFN to federate learning, and show that they have the potential to improve model fusion on different datasets."

The results are not promising enough to accept that TNA-PFN works effectively.\n\n- As mentioned in the paper, the MNIST results in the second plot of Figure 3 and the experimental results of Entezari, et al. (2022) show that the barrier actually decreases as the network width increases. According to the theorem presented in the paper, the barrier may decrease as the learned dimension decreases, but it does not apply well to these experiments.\n- In many experiments, the absolute barrier is too high when using TNA-PFN alone to be an LMC. Of course, it lowers the barrier compared to the vanilla train with no training, but many experiments show a non-negligible barrier.\n- There is almost no difference in LMC performance between weight matching (WM) after training with TNA-PFN and directly using weight matching. Weight matching after TNA-PFN requires a few fewer iterations, but I don't know how much of a cost savings this provides. From a practical perspective, it introduces an additional hyperparameter, the mask ratio $\\rho$, so I'm not sure how much benefit there is compared to the cost of tuning it.\n- It's good to have a variety of experiments, but there are no experiments on large datasets like ImageNet. It would have been nice to see some experiments on larger datasets, as they generally have different characteristics than MNIST and CIFAR10.\n---\n**Entezari, et al.** [The Role of Permutation Invariance in Linear Mode Connectivity of Neural Networks](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=dNigytemkL). *ICLR*, 2022"

Firstly, the authors propose a mask-based training scheme, which has already been explored in the literature. While there are variations in the masking details, such as random weight initialization for untrained weights, the overall approach resembles dropout regularization, where different subsets of neurons are masked during each iteration.\n\nFurthermore, the results presented in the paper strike me as somewhat expected. The authors themselves acknowledge in Theorem 3.2 that improving Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) is achieved by reducing the number of neurons, denoted by $d$. This essentially means using a simpler model, and the neural network is not necessarily overparameterized. Consequently, the number of minima is reduced, leading to a reduction in barriers between different solutions."

Then $W$ follows a Matrix Normal distribution, i.e., $W\\sim MN(0, I, I)$. By applying permutation matrices $P$ and $Q$ to $W$, the result distribution has the same Matrix Normal form, i.e., $PWQ \\sim MN(0, I, I)$. Hence, the permutated weight matrix maintains the same distribution as the original $W$. This suggests that permuting the weight matrix is equivalent to reinitializing it. Given this equivalence, it raises the question of how to consider all permutations, given that the search space is uncountable.\n2. The \"mask ratio\" is not precisely defined, and it seems to be related to the ratio of untrained neurons to the total number of neurons. \n3. Is it possible to express the results in Theorem 3.2 in terms of \"loss barrier\" or \"accuracy barrier\"?"
