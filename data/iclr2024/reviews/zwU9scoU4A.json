This improves over prior work on Graphon Mean Field Games which only allows for modelling with dense graphs. The authors derive convergence properties for the finite game. In addition, a learning algorithm based on online mirror descent is provided for a particular class of GXMFGs that follow a core-periphery network structure. Finally, the theoretical claims are empirically validated over both synthetic and real-world networks."

The paper presents a specialized learning algorithm for GXMFGs. \n\nKey contributions include:\n\n1. Introduction of GXMFGs, extending the scope of Mean Field Games.\n2. Provides theoretical guarantees to show that GXMFGs accurately approximates finite systems.\n3. Development of a learning algorithm tailored to GXMFGs.\n4. Empirical validation on synthetic and real-world networks, demonstrating GXMFGs' ability to model agent interactions and determine equilibria effectively."
