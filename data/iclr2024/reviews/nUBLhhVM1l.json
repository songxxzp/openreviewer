                "value": "This paper studies the outlier transfer problem, that is, the problem of transfer learning under the setting of outlier detection or rare class classification. The objective of the Neyman-Pearson classification problem, which formalizes the rare class classification problem, is to achieve low classification error on the rare class, while keeping the classification error on the common class under a threshold. However, in practice, we usually have only limited amount of or even none data from the target rare class, but some data from a related source rare class. This is where transfer learning comes into play. The goal of this paper is to theoretically understand when and how the knowledge from a source class can improve the classification performance on a target class under the setting of rare class classification.\n\nThe authors first show that at the population level, under certain assumptions, all the solutions to the source Neyman-Pearson classification problem are also solutions to the target Neyman-Pearson classification problem. Then the authors turn their attention to the finite-sample setting. The authors first define the outlier transfer exponent, which is a notion of discrepancy between source and target under a hypothesis class. With that discrepancy, the authors give a minimax lower bound on the target-excess error, which measures the difference between the expected error of the solution obtained by transfer learning and of the optimal solution. Furthermore, the authors propose an algorithm that does not need any prior knowledge of the discrepancy between the source and target class distributions."

However, in practice, the exact VC dimension may be unknown. Could you please give some practical suggestions on using this algorithm when the exact VC dimension is unknown?\n\n(3) The notation in inequality (4.1) is a little redundant. Since $h_{S, \\alpha}^*$ is a solution to the source problem, the difference between the expected error of any $h$ in the hypothesis class and of $h_{S, \\alpha}^*$ w.r.t. the source distribution must be non-negative. So, there is no need to use the max function.\n\n (4) The theoretical results mainly rely on the previous techniques.\n\n(5) There is no experiment."
