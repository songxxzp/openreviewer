The authors do a good job of explaining and justifying these conclusions given experimental evidence, with the appropriate amount of uncertainty given the noisiness of the data. I think that correctly calibrating the uncertainty is a great strength of the paper. \n\nExcellent analysis of scaling different axes (pretraining data, model size, finetuning data)"

Since the datasets seem to support up to 1e-6 and 1e-7 training sentences, I wish the authors had compared the scaling on even larger finetuning datasets to enable direct comparison to FMT in Figure 3. \n\n#### Fig 5\nI didn't really understand Figure 5. My my understanding is that the figure analyzes the fitted power laws, and the x-y- point indicates the estimated amount of finetuning necessary to achieve the performance parity between the two approaches at different model sizes. Does the ordering here matter (e.g. FMT vs LoRA, or LoRA vs FMT) -- my understanding is that it should not."

This raises concerns about the law's applicability to larger models, especially those of 70B or exceeding 100B in size.\n-The paper omits some details regarding model training.

Can there be, and should there be, some controlling for the complexity of the law itself?\n\n2. Where are the counterparts of Table 2 for the other tasks and other metrics (besides perplexity)? My apologies if I am overlooking something in the paper. It seems like these other numbers would be given prominently.\n\n3. The paper does say that the BLEURT-RougeL picture \"shows high correlation with the PPL scores in general\", but eye-balling Figure 7 in the appendix doesn't support this too well, though it's easy to imagine that the quantitative picture is different. But what is the quantitative picture?\n\n4. The promise of the paper is that the scaling law will provide guidance for people seeking to fine-tune. However, the guidance seems to me that perplexity will generally go down for all methods, but that the best method and precisely ideal stopping point will be highly variable. This guidance is very familiar and doesn't need to be characterized with a \"scaling law\". Is there more specific guidance implicit in this work?\n\n__The authors gave thoughtful answers to the above questions, which helped me understand the work better, and I raised my score by 1 point in response.__"
