The authors utilize a refined attention map by combining norm-based analysis and the integrated gradient method, which offers completeness in understanding the FF block's behavior. In the experiment, Wikipedia excerpts and Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2 datasets are used, and the authors analyzed 11 11 masked LMs and one casual LM. The results show that FF blocks do modify input contextualization by amplifying specific linguistic compositions, such as subword pairs forming a single word. Furthermore, the authors discover that the FF block and its surrounding components tend to cancel out each other's contextualization effects, shedding light on the mechanism and suggesting redundancy in processing within the Transformer layer."

They call this base formulation ATB. The authors further extend this notion to incorporate FFBs. The FFB's nonlinearity which makes it additively non-decomposable [a-la linearity of expectation] is overcome by using the integration gradients paper [Sundararajan et al, 2017]. The three resultant formulations, which incorporate just the linear, thenceforth residual connections and layer norm are christened ATBFF ATBFFRES and ATBFFRESLN. The Pre-Layer-Norm variants are [like the post-LayerNorm one before] named likewise. \n\nThe authors analyze a good variety of encoder only LM checkpoints in addition to a decoder only lM checkpoint [GPT2-117M] , which is also an instance of the pre-LN formulation.\n\nThe authors then interestingly proceed to analyze the contextualization changes caused by the FF block , both in terms of extent of change [based on flattening the pairwise values and taking Spearman Correlation of before-after], linguistic contextualization, as well as the dynamics."
