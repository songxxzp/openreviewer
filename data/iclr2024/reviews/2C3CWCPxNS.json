Rheinboldt, On Measures of Ill-Conditioning for Nonlinear Equations, Math. Comput., Vol. 30, pp. 104--111, 1976.) The formulation of PINNs is also a nonlinear equation in an infinite-dimensional space, so the novelty of this paper is questionable.\n\nIn addition, the proposed preconditioner is exactly the same as that for classical numerical methods. I suppose that if the proposed preconditioner is to be used, it would be better to use the classical numerical method instead of PINNs."

The authors say that PINNs, which are deep learning models that use physical rules, can sometimes face problems. These problems might make the PINNs work less accurately or not learn well.\n\nTo solve these problems, the authors suggest a special algorithm. This algorithm uses the condition number from a specific matrix to make PINNs learn better and make fewer errors. In simple terms, they tweak the problem a bit using a matrix to make it easier for the PINN to handle. This tweak helps the PINNs learn faster and be more accurate.\n\nThe authors tested their new algorithm on 16 different problems, like some common equations. They also checked how their method stands against other top methods. Their results show that their new algorithm works better in terms of learning speed, accuracy, and how much computer power it needs.\n\nKey points of the paper:\n\nThe authors present a new way to spot and fix issues in PINNs using the condition number.\nThey use a special algorithm that makes use of this condition number to help PINNs learn better.\nThey prove that their method works well by testing it on 16 problems and comparing it with other top methods.\nIn summary, this paper adds a lot to the understanding of physics-informed neural networks. It gives a new method that could make these networks work better in many different situations."

This is a well defined concept in the literature, it is not possible to define it however you like. Moreover, the supremum is taken on a dependant variable so it is not clear for me what is actually varying here. \n\nThe central theorem 3.6, which connects their 'condition number' to how the neural network approaches the solution looks nothing like a result one would obtain in the linear case. If one takes a look at the proof in the appendix, we can see how the condition number of the problem is artificially put in the theorem, making the theorem entirely vacuous. Not to mention the strenuous assumptions. \n\nIn section 4, \"Training PINNs with a Preconditioner\" they do not use a NN, $u$ just becomes a vector that is learned: no autograd, just finite differences, no neural networks. This formulation of the problem is very similar to finite elements, and using ILU preconditioning in this context is not new. \n\nEq 11. Have you simply replaced u_theta with the target u to obtain the result you were expecting? I could be wrong but i think this is a mistake.\n\nMany more flaws in the paper, but this is already sufficient for me to advise for a clear rejection."

The key advantage and promise of PINNs, compared to mesh-based/FEM/etc counter-parts, is their ability to generalize to higher-dimensional problems. This ability is unfortunately tainted by the need for the creation of a mesh in the proposed solution. On the second page, the authors make the assumption of d<=4 for the practicality of the proposed solution. This is a significant limitation of the work, and narrows its applicability to situations where FEMs can be expected to already be applicable.\n\n2. Most of the experiments in the paper are done with 5 random seeds. This sample size is inadequate for reliable and significant conclusions.\n\n3.
