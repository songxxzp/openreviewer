In AgentVerse, the user enters in a command/question and then the framework will collect responses to the command/question from the LLM after its been prompted to act as a particular type of expert. Then, the expert agents will collaborate and attempt to synthesize a concise response for the user, either in an unordered/parallel manner or ordered/serial manner. The result of this decomposition produces better responses (as measured by various problem solving benchmarks) that are agnostic to the underlying LLM (GPT3.5-Turbo and GPT4)."

The authors' experiments demonstrate that AGENTVERSE outperforms individual agents in tasks requiring general understanding, reasoning, and coding, especially when state-of-the-art models are employed. The authors analyze behavioral patterns emerging from the AGENTVERSE process, observing emergent behaviors in agent groups, such as volunteering, conformity behavior, and destructive behavior.

The evaluation scores generated by the module are also unreliable as well, especially when the module is following a zero-shot format. The quality of the evaluation scores will impact the framework largely.\n- The framework lacks some details or implementation recommendations (How does the number of agents influence the performance? How do the tools influence the final problem-solving? How many turns on average are needed to solve the problems in the tasks displayed in the paper?)\n- Some basic explanations/analyses are missing in the paper as well. (1) In Table 1, why do agents based on GPT-3.5 have better performance in a solo setting than group? Why is the situation inverse for GPT-4-based agents? How do the agents' abilities matter in the framework? (2) It seems that the Group setting performance usually has a small gain compared with CoT and Solo. I am just wondering whether Group can be easily surpassed by the other techniques, like self-refine, etc.\n- The entire framework is too long and complicated. The prompts include module prompts, interaction history, and agent prompts, which are a large number of tokens to call the OpenAI API. The cost is a huge concern here to use the framework for evaluation. Furthermore, the framework is also much too inefficiency compared with the performance gain led by the multi-agent interactions."
