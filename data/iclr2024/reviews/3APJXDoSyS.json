It observes that improving the transferability of features can harm the discriminability of FSCIL models because too much feature spread can degrade the quality of feature-mean class representations. To address this issue, the paper suggests not only increasing the intra-class distance but also decreasing the inter-class distance. By minimizing the inter-class distance, the learned representation achieves a balance between transferability and discriminability. The proposed representation learning approach, referred to as \"the-Closer-the-Better (CnB),\" combines the joint objective of softmax cross-entropy (SCE) loss with a lower temperature, self-supervised contrastive (SSC) loss, and inter-class distance minimization. The experimental results demonstrate that CnB improves both transferability and discriminability without requiring the storage of exemplars, test-time augmentation, or weight updates when learning new classes. The paper aims to provide a more effective solution for FSCIL by challenging common beliefs and practices about inter-class distance in representation learning."

Additionally, relying solely on hyperparameters to control the L_{inter} and ensure both transferability and discriminability is not practical, especially in long sequences of few-shot incremental learning where old class samples are unavailable, and the number of new samples is limited.\n3. The paper highlights the importance of various hyperparameters, such as temperature, loss weights, and margin parameters. It would be beneficial to provide more guidance on how to tune these hyperparameters effectively, as their values can significantly impact the performance of the proposed method.\n4. While the paper presents experimental evidence, it lacks a more detailed theoretical analysis of why the proposed approach works.

However, this paper lacks of convincing empirical results of comparing with others to support the proposed method.  Moreover, as the authors mentioned that the minimizing inter-distance is counter-intuitive, I suggest the authors can give more detailed explanation on this, not only show some experimental results to verify the assertion. \n\nMore questions,  concerns and suggestions are as follows:\n1. Performance on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR100 and MiniImageNet are less convincing for the validity of proposed method. Prevailing methods like NC-FSCIL and SAVC are not included in the CIFAR and MiniImageNet table.  \n\n2. The main idea of the paper is learning compact and transferable representations by proposing a novel loss function to minimize the distance between features of all classes.  By utilizing this loss, the model is encouraged to learn similar representations of all classes.  However, is it likely to damage model\u2019s discriminability of novel classes?  In figure 1(c), though proposed method allows the model learns less overlapping representations between base and novel classes, it seems the model cannot separate feature representation of novel classes well compared to baseline methods and self-supervised method in figure (a) and (b). Also in Figure 6(c), the model is not separate the novel classes well.\n\n3. The ablations in table 2 are incomplete. If the model is trained simply uses L_inter or L_ssc without DA or low temperature, which has more impact on the performance?\n\n4. Details of experimental setting are missing. Which dataset is used for experiments in figure 2,3,4? What kind of the incremental learning setting is adopted in these experiments (number of base classes, incremental sessions)? \n\n5. In table 5 second row, Inter-class* obtains the best performance in A_N and should be marked as bold.\n\n6. Under the proposed learning objective, is it likely that CR, which simply computing the mean feature of novel classes, may not be very effective for incremental learning? Without any further constraints on the updated classifier , is it possible that the model learns very similar new class prototypes in incremental sessions, which leads to less discriminative performance on novel classes? Considering other methods that updates the classifier might boost the performance further, such as the mode2, mode3 in Constrained-FSCIL or the NC-FSCIL."

A unique characteristic of the FSCIL problem is the sequential learning of new classes during the subsequent phases. However, this work only focuses on the pre-training on the base classes and does not provide deeper insight into how the system continuously learns along the time steps.\n\nThe improvements by this approach seem to be quite marginal, for instance, 63.58 vs 62.50 on CUB200 (1.08%), and 53.32 vs 52.10 on CIFAR100 (1.22%).
