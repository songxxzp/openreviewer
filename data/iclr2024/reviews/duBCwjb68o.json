The main difference between the original consistency models follows: (a) Consideration of augmented ODE with guidance scale $\\omega$ to enable the distillation in a single stage, (b) use skipping timesteps for distillation since pretrained Stable Diffusion uses larger timestep (1,000) than original consistency models that use EDM formulation."

The paper argues there are two main contributions: (a) usage of augmented ODE and (b) skipped timestep (e.g., $k=20$) for better distillation. For (a), it seems quite straightforward to consider augmented ODE since the Stable Diffusion uses cfg. For (b), it also seems straightforward since Stable Diffusion uses a large timestep ($T=1000$), unlike EDM formulation in the original consistency model paper, and thus, one can easily expect using consecutive timesteps for distillation is inefficient. In these respects, I think both (a) and (b) looks too straightforward and marginal technical contribution to be accepted at ICLR. \n-  Title -- \"Latent\" Consistency model? I expected the authors to consider unique aspects of the \"latent\" diffusion model in incorporating the concept of consistency models; for instance, the original consistency model paper argues using perceptual metrics is efficient for better distillation. However, it seems the proposed method does not depend on whether the pretrained model is a latent diffusion model or not; it can be applied to any diffusion model that uses a large timestep (e.g., $T=1000$); thus, I think including \"latent\" in the title is unnecessary. \n- For figures for qualitative illustrations, it's better to provide text prompts to show the image-text alignment as well."

The original consistency model paper mainly uses the LPIPS score, but it seems such a metric is not applicable since this method deals with latent diffusion models."
