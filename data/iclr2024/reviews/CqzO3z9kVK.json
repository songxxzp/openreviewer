Authors mentioned in the introduction part that multi-task learning is one of the two main-stream knowledge fusion methods but it suffers from high annotation cost and complex algorithm. However, I can't see why multi-task learning would be more data-hungry than first training individual models on each dataset and then merging them into a single one. As for the second limitation, still, I am not convinced that multi-task learning would be more complex than existing model merging algorithms.  Moreover, the author postulate that model merging is an optimization problem. However, there seems to be no further explanation, e.g., what is the goal of the optimization \"problem\"? \n+ Table 1 is Confusing. What do you mean by \"round\" and \"key step\"? More explanation is in need.\n+ The structure of the submission still have rooms for improvement. For example, 3.1 is not necessarily a preliminary or premise to understand the method. Therefore I would suggest moving this part to related work. Besides, the experiments in Section 5.4 Ablation Study are not ablation experiments but hyper-parameter analysis, strictly speaking.\n+ Missing related work. The task arithmetic  should be discussed, with EDITING MODELS WITH TASK ARITHMETIC as a representative example."

Development sets are needed to guide the evolution process across rounds. The method can be combined with model merging approaches, which in contrast, perform knowledge fusion across a single round.\n\nThe experiments are performed on the same experimental setups as in the paper introducing RegMean, including the same setups, data sets and initializations.  Results show that the evolutionary algorithm performs better than other methods like greedy soup and mostly better than Fisher-weighted averaging, albeit usually lower than the best model merging method. However, when combined with model merging approaches like RegMean and Fisher-weighted averaging, it leads to significantly better results than evolution or merging alone.\n\nThe novelty of the paper is the experimental results and application of existing approaches in evolutionary algorithms to this problem of knowledge fusion.
