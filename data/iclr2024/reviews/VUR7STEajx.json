But here which part is masked? since there are multiple modalities, is it modality-specific masking? or others? have the authors experimented with any varieties of masking strategies? \n\n\"The genomics data, sourced from SNPs, was encoded to display only the minor and major allele in the sequence.\" what does this mean? every sample has both minor and major alleles? That does not make sense? \n\nIt would be great for the authors to give an exact example of what the input looks like. \n\nIs there ablations on which modality is most useful? For example, is genetics useful at all since some works have shown that EHR information overrides with genetics signals. \n\nAlso, why are only 700 SNPs used? there are 800K genotyped SNPs, if not considering imputed arrays. These could be used for pre-training. \n\nThe authors used MMD disease as the prediction task. The data curation is also based on this task, which is limited.\n\nThere are many pre-trained foundation models for each modality, why not use them? but to train itself?\n\nWhat are clusters in the Figure 2 and 3? There are little information with the current set of labels. Could the authors change to other more meaningful labels? \n\nWhat is \"Mean Absolute Percentage Error\"? \n\nWhy do AUROC and AUPRC differ so much? For example in Table 4, E10-14, XGB has 0.859 the best AUROC but 0.162 worst AUPRC?"

M-BioBERTa introduces novel elements like temporal embeddings for longitudinal data and mixed tabular embeddings for heterogeneous types. The authors utilize UK Biobank data to train and benchmark M-BioBERTa. M-BioBERTa outperforms baselines in disease and drug burden prediction, effectively handling missing modalities.
