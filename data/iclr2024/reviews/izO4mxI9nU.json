I agree that the CIFAR10N to CIFAR10H is more  \u201cclose to the real world\u201d as the paper acknowledges \u2013 I would recommend an expanded discussion of the actual realism of the experimental setup, including the underlying assumptions, and cases wherein these may not hold. \n\n\u2013 Unless I missed it, the paper lacks a few important ablations eg. what is performance without performing noisy label augmentation?\n\n\u2013 The paper does not provide a principled way to select the number of clusters K. It claims that fuzzy K-Means is robust to this, but this claim is not validated. In the paper\u2019s real-world experiments, K=3 simply works well because of a reduction in the number of users/cluster to train a cluster-specific model, which is simply an artifact of the experimental design. It would be helpful to see i) what K values work well with more data ii) what a principled way to select K might be, and if Fuzzy KMeans is indeed robust to this choice.\n\n\u2013 I found the presentation of the approach rather complex and difficult to follow. For instance, Eq. 2 presents a complex per-user feature vector construction strategy without any particular justification/intuition. Similarly, it would be helpful to summarize the intuition behind the crowdlab consensus labeling strategy employed in Eq. 1. \n\n\u2013 The paper would be strengthened by a deeper analysis of the noisy label patterns learned for the real-world data \u2013 while the results presented in Fig 5 are helpful, it would be nice to qualitative visualize examples of some of the labeling biases identified by the user clustering and corrected by the algorithm.\n\n\u2013 It would be interesting to also discuss the applicability of the proposed method to settings beyond multiclass classification eg. would a similar method be applicable in a multilabel setting, where each image has multiple possible latent labels?"

The absence of such comparisons may lead to questions about the thoroughness of the evaluation and the generalizability of the proposed method across different noisy label learning scenarios.\n\n2. **Lack of Comprehensive Review on Learning with Noisy Labels**:\n   Given that the paper addresses the challenge of noisy labels, it would be beneficial to include a thorough review of existing methods for learning with noisy labels. This review should cover the spectrum of strategies employed to mitigate the impact of label noise and how these strategies compare to the proposed HAICO-CN method. By situating HAICO-CN within the broader context of the field, the paper would provide readers with a clearer understanding of the novelty and significance of the proposed method. Moreover, such a review could highlight how HAICO-CN contributes to or diverges from established theories and practices in noisy label learning.\n\n3. **Potential Limitations in Technical Contribution**:\n   While the paper introduces a novel cluster-wise noisy-label augmentation technique, its technical contribution may appear limited if it does not sufficiently differentiate itself from existing work. For example, the paper could benefit from discussing the recent findings from \"Identifiability of Label Noise Transition Matrix\" (ICML23), which also employs a cluster-based approach to infer clean labels from noisy ones. \n\n4. **Reliance on Accurate Clustering of User Noise Patterns**:\n   The effectiveness of HAICO-CN is predicated on the precise clustering of users based on their noise patterns. However, this process may be fraught with challenges. Firstly, it is possible that the clustering assumption does not hold. Specifically, even if it is satisfied, it is unknown when the cluster can be identified, and whether the proposed method can successfully identify them.  There is also the concern of temporal dynamics\u2014users' labeling patterns may evolve due to factors such as learning, fatigue, or changes in the task context. If HAICO-CN cannot adapt to these changes, the performance of the personalized models may degrade."
