                "value": "This paper proposes a new method to address collider bias in causal effect estimation. The main idea is to model the collider bias as a out-of-distribution estimation problem. The algorithm uses two generators for generating the observational data and the selection indicator ($S=0,1$), and correspondingly two discriminators to discern the generated data as coming from $S=1$ or $S=0$. The generators and discriminators are adversarially trained using standard methods such as GAN. Experiments are conducted on synthetic datasets and semi-synthetic datasets with artificially induced collider bias."

The Twins dataset is usually used only for evaluating ATE estimations as there is no ground truth counterfactual outcomes.\n2. Have the authors compared with more recently proposed CATE/ATE estimators? For example TEDVAE [1], DR-CFR [2]. As the currently compared methods are mainly not designed for collider and are a bit outdated, comparing with more recent methods can further demonstrate if the proposed approach is effective. As we are now at ICLR 2024, it seems insufficient to have most of the baselines proposed in 2016/2017.\n3. Also is there any reason for selecting the datasets used in the manuscript? IHDP itself is a semi-synthetic dataset with only one data generation process, which only covers rather limited real-world scenarios. Twins is commonly used for ATE estimation instead of CATE estimation. Datasets with more comprehensive DGPs would be desirable, such as ACIC2016.\n\n[1] Treatment effect estimation with disentangled latent factors.

The authors make several ablation studies, including comparing the results using different datasets with the same CATE estimator, comparing the results with different sample sizes of the experimental dataset, and comparing the results with or without specific modules in DCGM.\n\n4. To address collider bias, the authors assume that a small-scale experimental dataset without collider bias is available, which can be easily obtained by conducting experiments on the target population and seems a common assumption in data fusion works. The assumptions made in the paper seem reasonable to me and are impractical in real applications.\n\nThe paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The studied problem, collider bias, is interesting and challenging. The authors propose a novel formulation of collider bias as an OOD problem and propose a method to generate unbiased samples using generative models with the help of an experimental dataset without collider bias.

In fact external validity is arguably the biggest drawback of the experimental data, as the factors that influence both selection into the experiment (S=1) and modify the treatment effect lead to a difference in the average causal effects between the experimental population and a target populations.\n\nIn healthcare, for instance, people who are eligible AND join the trials (i.e. the experimental data in your case) are nothing near representative of the entire population. Therefore, while it is common practice to compare experimental and observational data or attempt to combine them, this is only possible, without further assumptions, to the extent of \"overlap\" between the entire population (as captured by the observational data) and the experimental population.  See some references for the generalizability of experiments problem in various domains:\n\n\"External validity of randomised controlled trials:\u201cto whom do the results of this trial apply?\u201d Rothwell et al., The Lancet, 2005.\n\"The generalizability of survey experiments,\" Mullinick et al., Journal of Experimental Political Science, 2015\n\"Generalizing causal inferences from individuals in randomized trials to all trial\u2010eligible individuals,\" Dahabreh et al., Biometrics. , 2019\n\nFurthermore, in Section 3.2 the authors state: \n\n\"We notice that the non-random sample selection caused by collider bias mainly results in the S = 0 data, i.e., the unselected data, completely missing in $D_{\\mathrm{obs}}$; And the critical problem in $D_{\\mathrm{exp}}$ is that the selection indicators are unknown.\"\n\nIt should be cited/noted where did they \"notice\" that? I do not see how, in real-world, the experimental data is never observed in the observational data. That would indicate zero overlap between studies which essentially makes any sort of joint inference infeasible. Also why the selection indicators are unknown in $D_{\\mathrm{exp}}$? Isnt it by definition $S=1$? And if experimental data is never selected as mentioned before, why would we expect the generator to ever generate S=0? I think what makes the algorithm work in experiments is the limited implicit overlap between the experimental and observational datasets that is also implied in the design of the generators, which does not seem to be inline with the verbal arguments/assumptions. \n\nThe assumptions as t how the covariate distributions in the experimental and observational distributions differ, with explicit reference to the role of selection/collider bias, should be made more clear, while staying grounded (i.e., the experimental data does not represent the entire population.)"

The concern is that they cannot be the same since they are sampled from two different causal graphs, i.e., there is an edge X->T for D_obs while this edge doesn't exist in D_exp.\n\nI believe that both D_obs and D_exp should be generated with the same causal graph.
