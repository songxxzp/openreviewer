The proof consists of two steps: reduction to sum of independent sub-Weibul variables (Lemma 4), and the corresponding moment bound on a sum of sub-weibull rv's. The first part is done thanks to a conditioning trick with Jensen's inequality. The second part is done thanks to a carful application of Latala's inequality (Lemma 7 in the appendix). This inequality is a direct extension of one from Kontorovich (2014) to an interesting non-trivial case. I particularly like that Theorem 1 does not have any extra logarithms.\n\nIt would be great to include some analysis of how optimal is the bound. Whether there are some cases, where each of the terms is necessary. For example, is it possible to replace the first term with \\sqrt{\\sum_{i = 1} E (F_i)^{2}}, i.e. without the orlizc norm? I understand how to do it if we can sacrifice additional logorithm in the second term (e.g. using Thm 15.10 in [1]), is it possible to do it without this sacrifice?\n\nMy other concern is about sub optimality of the generalization bounds listed on pages 5-6. Since the the original paper Bousquet & Eliseef (2002), there have beed significant improvements in these bounds [2, 3]. The proof in [3] works directly with moment bounds, perhaps it is possible to make it work with their technique and obtain a better generalization inequality. Since you mention generalization bounds in the title, I think it is crucial to make the bound closer to state-of-the-art.\n\nI also want to point out that the condition $|S - S_i| \\leq F_i(X_i, X_i')$ is also to some extent uniform, since it does not depend on $X_1, \\dots, X_{i-1}, X_{i+1}, \\dots, X_{n}$. Does the condition hold e.g. for ridge regression that you mention in the introduction?\n\nTo sum up, although the paper provides interesting results, there is room for immediate improvement.\n\n[1] Boucheron et al (2014) Concentration inequalities.\n\n[2] Feldman and Vondrak (2019).

So the main lemma seems to be Lemma 5. From my reading it is difficult to figure out why this is substantially different from the standard proof that Orlicz spaces ( for phi = exp(t^p) - 1 for p>1 ) have bounded moments. I understand that there is some convexity lost for p < 1 which is what you study but from the proof as written I fail to see the challenge (other than the fact that one can't go directly through the MGF. For example I am thinking of the proof here (https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.pdf Prop 2.5.2). The challenge seems to be showing sums of subWeibull satisfy subWeibull tails (or rather keeping track of the parameters; ) without using the MGF (if this interpretation is correct maybe it is useful to emphasize). In summary would be nice to have a part explaining the technical novelty\n- I would recommend moving the proofs of Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 to the appendix since they are standard to allow the reader to focus on the new contributions of the work. \n- I might be missing something simple but I don't see how one went from a bound in terms of F to a bound in terms of the Weibull diameter without further assumptions on f/F. A priori F is some arbitrary function of F(X_i , X'_i) right, unrelated to the distance? I guess that in the remark there is some Lipshitzness assumed.
