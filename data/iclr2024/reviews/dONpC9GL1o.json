The first condition (Corollary 1) leads to the threshold sampling algorithm, providing a direct explanation for its success. Assuming the loss to be cross-entropy, the second condition imposes a linear constraint that can be solved with a linear programming optimizer.Combining both conditions, the proposed basis-aware threshold (BAT) sampling outperforms its threshold-based counterparts for low-entropy open-ended text generation."

Therefore, the induced sampling algorithm may also discard tokens in the support of true distribution, leading to biased sampling.\n3. In Corollary 1, the statement \"threshold-based truncation sampling correctly discards all tokens that are not in the support of p*\" is not precise, as it may also incorrectly discard tokens that are in the support of p*. A more precise phrasing would be: \"all tokens that are not in the support of p* will be discarded by threshold-based truncation sampling.\"\n4. The relationship between the softmax bottleneck and text degeneration phenomena has not been verified. It remains unclear whether text degeneration is directly caused by the softmax bottleneck, or if increasing the dimensionality (d) beyond the vocabulary size (v) would effectively resolve the issue."

The gist is that if you truncate a sufficiently large portion of the distribution, then truncation sampling will avoid any tokens which are not in the support of the true language distribution. However, this may result in throwing out tokens which *are* in the support of the distribution. The paper then proposes BAT-sampling, which is an LP-based method that can determine which tokens are and are not in the support of the true distribution, even if they are \"out of order\" in terms of the probability assigned (i.e., the method can determine that lower-probability tokens are in the support of the distribution even when higher probability tokens are not). The paper concludes with a set of experiments, including an impressive discussion of speedups for BAT-sampling, as well as some (very slight) improvements over existing methods in certain conditions."

The fact that BAT can determine that some tokens have nonzero true support, even though they are assigned less probability than others which are not in the support of the true distribution, is a surprising and compelling result. Leveraging the softmax bottleneck is a clever trick here and one that will be unexpected to most readers in NLP. \n\nI expected BAT to be computationally infeasible to run in practice due to its dependence on an LP-solver at each tilmestep of decoding. However, the speedups in the \"Basis-aware threshold sampling in practice\" (namely, using a decomposition of the softmax matrix and only relying on BAT when a token under the threshold probability is chosen) seem reasonable and compelling, and the amortized cost of 0.1s/token, while slow, is not infeasible for certain classes of applications.\n\nThe experiments, although not particularly compelling as a reason to start using BAT sampling in practice, seem reasonable and sufficiently thorough. In particular, the analysis of performance as more constraints are added back (after the SVD) is very clear. In contrast, I did not find the \"BAT outperforms all other methods for GPT-2-Large\" paragraph very compelling given that BAT is not the best-performing model on any other model size."

The authors proceed to devise a novel sampling strategy, building upon the approximation error incurred by the softmax output bottleneck. Essentially, the idea is to assume that a token has a non-zero probability under the true distribution, not only if it has a non-zero probability under the predicted distribution (which is a source of overestimation errors) but also if it is non-zero under all distributions that \"map back\" to the hidden state by taking the transpose of the output embedding matrix. Intuitively, this measures whether a token has a non-zero probability by chance, i.e. if its information can be conveyed by any combination of other tokens while mapping back to the hidden state. This is formalized in the paper by assuming that the hidden state is the minimizer of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the true distribution. This insight serves to devise a novel sampling strategy that can sample low-probability next tokens, which differs from current approaches that rely on thresholding."
