                "value": "Modern time series forecasting methods are heavily-parametrised, and in spite of their compelling performance on benchmark datasets, may not be appropriate in resource-constrained settings. In the spirit of recent work leveraging representations of time series in the frequency domain, the authors propose a new methodology that captures amplitude and phase information using a real-valued neural network. A low-pass filter is also included to further reduce the size of the model. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates how model performance is comparable (and sometimes better) to other SOTA techniques while also having orders of magnitude less parameters. The suitability of the model to anomaly detection via time series reconstruction is also validated on a variety of datasets."

The insights on why the model works better on some datasets than others (e.g. citing the binary nature of some time series, as well as overall limitations with benchmarks in the field) was also appreciated."

There is consequently a risk that the experiment featured here might not be sufficiently conclusive (although the results obtained on synthetic data are a step in the right direction)."

Are (i)RIN and (i)rFFT performed in parallel or sequentially? Please elaborate more on how RIN works, either in the Figure or its caption. \n* Have you experimented with more sophisticated layers than just linear? \n* What is the back-casting task, and how is it used in training?\n* Can you motivate in 1-2 sentences why the output length needs to be controlled (Section 3.3)?\n* You say the LPF discards components beyond the model's learning capabilities. What do you mean by this? The model's capabilities are independent of the signal, and high frequencies are not always noise or irrelevant. It seems domain-specific. Furthermore, you say high-frequency components such as trends are filtered out. First, trend signals can be low-frequency, and second, they are particularly important in the forecasting realm.\n* The method is particularly interesting because of its parameter-effectiveness. Can you perform experiments on real-time inference time on simple hardware (not necessarily edge devices) to substantiate this (e.g., real-time anomaly detection)? What are the challenges regarding domain shifts and refitting, and how could they be addressed? This could substantially improve the focus and contribution of the paper."

FITS offers a novel perspective on these tasks, viewing them as interpolation exercises within the frequency domain. This approach extends time series segments for forecasting and reconstructing downsampled data. FITS employs a complex-valued linear layer to master amplitude scaling and phase shift, facilitating efficient complex frequency domain interpolation. Its compact size and competitive performance render FITS an excellent choice for edge devices, unlocking a wide array of applications in time series analysis."
