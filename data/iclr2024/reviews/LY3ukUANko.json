To verify the impact of this gap, the authors conduct systematic studies and provide both empirical and theoretical evidence. Moreover, the authors present strategies for migrating this gap."

                "value": "There's a lot of typos and confusing writing. It's hard to properly understand all the theoretical claims of the work. For starters, Proposition 4.3 should say `u \\in \\{ 0, 1 \\}^{N \\times \\log c}`. The description of definition 3.1 could be improved; a simple example would be quite helpful. In appendix, `N` sometimes means the entire sequence length or the number of triplets in MQAR; this confusion is exacerbated by the fact that the meaning changes in the same theorem/proof.\n\nPage 6 states \"[e]ach BaseConv layer uses O(Nd) parameters and ... O(Nd) operations\". I believe it uses `O(Nd +d^2)` parameters and `O(d N log N + Nd^2)` FLOPs? This makes me believe that the rest of the theoretical results may have to be carefully revisited by the authors.\n\nPage 26. Proof of C.19. It's unclear how `Q[i, :]` can be set to a zero vector when `i \\notin Q` (also boldface 0 suffices to express a vector; no need for a superscript d; also, d is defined as `log(C)` in the same page but `C` is a set. `d = log(c)` small c since `c := |C|`.) and similarly for `K` and `V`, because QKV is actually a linear projection of the input. Linear projection can not implement this non-linear operation of masking some of the activations out. There's a sentence that reads `... where Q, K, V ... are positional embeddings ...`. They are different projections of u.\n\nThe calculation of the percentage of gap due to AR hits could be better motivated and justified in appendix.\n\nOther minor typos:\n - `u * k = FFT^{-1} (FFT(u) FFT(k))` (should drop the convolution operation in frequency domain).\n - Page 5: Other tokens: ... `1,000` => `1250`."

It is not clear whether their claims still holds empirically given the shrinking trend of the performance gap that can already be observed under the current setting. \n\nThe paper does not provide important technical details for reproducibility. The implementation details of the proposed modification of selectively look-up is missing.\n\nThe research problem that the authors are trying to solve has been alleviated with existing [1,2] or emerging solutions [3,4]. The authors do not examine the empirical AR ability of data-dependant convolutions by claiming technical difficulties, but there does exist data-dependant SSMs, such as Liquid-S4 [2], that support causal language modeling. Not to mention the latest GCM, Monarch Mixer [3], that also supports causality. On hybridization, a previous work [4] on dynamic input subset selection for attention modules has also been proposed for efficiently combining SSMs with attention. The authors should consider comparing the proposed architectural modifications with these works to avoid being outdated upon publication.\n\n---\n[1] Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (ICLR 2023)\n\n[2] Liquid Structural State-Space Models (ICLR 2023)\n\n[3] Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (NeurIPS 2023)\n\n[4] Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (NeurIPS 2023)"
