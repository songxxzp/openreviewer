Based on the observation that SPC is not robust to the extreme pixel values (near 0 and 1), the proposed method uses a mask and hyperparameter to dynamically adjust the range. Based on the mask, MSPC proposes a bi-level optimization that can detect backdoor samples without the need to specify a threshold. The experiment results show the proposed method is effective in detecting several existing backdoor attacks."

                "value": "This paper proposes an optimization framework to improve an existing backdoor sample detecting method Scaled Prediction Consistency (SPC). It identifies two limitations of SPC, in terms of the unusual SPC values of backdoor vs. clean samples. It addresses the limitations of SPC by introducing a pre-shift and a learnable mask into SPC, and proposes to use a bilevel optimization framework to first find a small mask and then only scale up the masked region of the image. The new loss function is named Mask-aware SPC (MSPC).  The way to find the minimal mask is similar to the Cognitive Distillation method introduced in (Huang et al. 2023), which should be able to accurately locate the backdoor trigger position. With the learned mask and scaling factor $n$, the authors further propose to automatically identify the backdoored samples from a training dataset with the help of binary variable $w_i$ ($w=1$ for backdoored sample whilst $w=0$  for clean sample). Eventually, if the MSPC loss is >0, then $w_i$ should be 1 to minimize the overall loss $(1-w_i)\\cdot L_{MSPC}$. I.e., counting samples with non-negative MSPC loss or $w_i=1$ yields the final backdoor samples. Experiments with 8 backdoor attacks on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The paper is poorly written, it takes the reviewer to read many times to get the core idea. The relationship to existing works SPC and Cognitive Distillation (CD) should be accurately summarized and discussed. The fundamental/technical difference should be clearly explained.\n\n2. At the beginning of Section 4, it explains why SPC fails the two cases. Yet this was not systematically or quantitatively analyzed. Those are just conjectures.\n\n3. The key technical novelty is the introduction of a learnable mask into the MSPC loss, however, the technique is very similar to an existing backdoor detection method proposed by (Huang et al. 2023). \n\n4. The automatic filtering variable $w_i$ seems unnecessary, as at the end of Section 4, the authors stated that \"backdoor samples will simply be the ones with MSPC loss greater than 0\".\n\n5. The two proposed practical conditions: 1) free of clean data; and 2) free of detection threshold, look both ok to me. Many defense works assume the availability of a small subset of clean samples, which is quite practical in real-world scenarios. The reviewer understands it is nice to satisfy both conditions but does not think this makes the proposed method fundamentally superior to other detection methods. For condition 2, if all training samples with MSPC loss greater than 0 should be removed, the detector will remove many clean samples when the dataset is extremely clean or dirty (extremely low/high poisoning rates). \n\n6. Strong adaptive attacks should know the mask, it then can adapt itself to have low MSPC loss with multiple surrogate models rather than one, in case to overfit the current model as it did in the \"Resistance against Potential Adaptive Attacks.\" experiments. In other words, generating strong poisons should also be done in a bilevel manner.\n\n7. In Table 1, the detection performance shown on CIFAR-10 is worse than that reported in the Cognitive Distillation (CD) paper (Huang et al. 2023) (their AUC is above 90%), and the results on test (and poisoned) samples should also be reported.   This means the use of CD in the proposed way actually hurts the detection performance, which may be caused by the automatic search process with $w_i$ and the SPC loss."

While it is acknowledged that running the STRIP method on ImageNet 200 presents time complexity challenges, I would like to point out that this method does not appear to encounter runtime issues comparable to your proposed methods, which require solving a discrete bi-level optimization problem.
