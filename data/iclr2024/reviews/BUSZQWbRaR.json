PCL is not compared with any existing method for learning a logical formulas, not even standard TMs. The significance of this theoretical results depends on whether PCL is a practical ML algorithm or not.\n- The authors mention practical implications of this work in the abstract.

Vote sum, vote error and the margin are mentioned for the first and only time.\n\n  \"Upon sampling from P(Feedback), TA state adjustments are computed \"\n\nHow does the sampling work? Input pairs (x,y) are sampled according to P(Feedback), which in turn depends on the prediction of the current TM state?
