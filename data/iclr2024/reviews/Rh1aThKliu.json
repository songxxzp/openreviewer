From an end-user perspective, the inputs under either the weak semantic attack or OoD attack are non-sensical. The user of the LLM should simply write a legit sentence if they noticed what they wrote. \n- For example, one improvement that can be made is to use some NLP based metrics instead of p-norm. \n- The paper might want to look into this review paper [1] to formulate more realistic problem setup.\n2. From my understanding, the most common scenario for hallucination is for unperturbed prompts to have a hallucinated response. The paper is probably more relevant to hallucination generation than hallucination itself. \n3. \"Hallucinations are not bugs, but features\" is a very ambitious statement that the paper cannot fully support. I believe this statement is partially inspired from [2]. However, some logics are missing. \n- To identify hallucination as a fundamental property of the LLM model, the author should empirically (ideally theoretically) show that why hallucination is unavoidable. To mitigate it, what is the tradeoff. For example, we might have to sacrifice some performance. \n- For example, the paper might want to adopt a similar strategy to [2] by defining what are robust, non-robust features, and show that the LLM performance rely on both features for high accuracy. \n4. The key techinical contribution of the paper is the development of the hallucination attack, i.e. use a gradient-based token replacing strategy from [3] to recursively obtain the propmt candidate set with (weak semantic) / without (OoD) the metric constraints with the original sample. The token-replaced strategy seems to be a widely-used strategy already, and the author's work seems to change the objective from classical tasks (e.g. sentiment analsyis) into hallucinated response. I would like the author to better explain their techinical novelty compared to the existing works."

I think if the author train a supervised classifier on response prompts with three labels raw, OoD, weak semantic prompts can probably give a higher performance. I don't think thresholds is a realistic defense strategy. \n- If we train the adversarial prompts differently, e.g. let the norm constraint be the entropy constraint, this defense strategy will likely fail very bad. \n2. I am wonderly if it is possible to try other gradient-based attacks than the token replacing attacks? \n\n[1]: Siren's Song in the AI Ocean: A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models.

                "value": "1. My primary concern is that the adversarial attack methods used in this paper appear to be very similar to those of Shin et al. (2020) and Zou et al. (2023). The optimization process, including gradient backpropagation and random position selection, seems to be identical to that of Zou et al. The only difference I discern is that the authors have added a perturbation budget constraint in their \"weak semantic\" setting in an attempt to maintain semantic consistency (the exact implementation of this hard constraint in the optimization process is unclear). Despite these similarities, the authors neither cite nor discuss these related works, nor do they compare their results with them in the experiments. I suggest that the authors thoroughly discuss the similarities and differences with these related papers and consider using them as baselines for their experiments.\n2. While \"hallucination\" may be an overused term today, arguably, people are more concerned with why models produce factually incorrect or inconsistent answers under \"normal,\" \"meaningful\" prompts. Even for weak semantic prompts, the prompts obtained in this paper still seem to have a clear discrepancy from normal human requests. Given this, the results of the paper are not particularly interesting, as Zou et al.'s adversarial attacks have already demonstrated that models can output strings that perfectly match their expected outputs. I recommend that the authors discuss more how their work helps understand the phenomenon of hallucination and better connect their results with the mechanisms of hallucination.\n3. The experimental results are not comprehensive enough. The authors did not consider baseline methods (e.g., from Shin et al. or Zou et al.), making the results difficult to interpret. The experiments were conducted on two open-source models, whereas people might be more interested in the performance on proprietary models such as ChatGPT and Claude 2.\n4. The evaluation metrics in the experiments are also unclear: the authors mention using \"human feedback to assess whether LLMs' responses are satisfactory,\" but what about partial matches? Moreover, they use humans as semantic extractors, but how do they evaluate whether the features extracted by humans meet the \u03b5 budget? The authors could clarify some key details of the evaluation metrics.\n5. The presentation of this paper could be significantly improved. Some sentences are difficult to understand, such as the sentence on page 4: \"For an original prompt x, the key idea is to selectively replace some \u201ctrigger\u201d tokens \u03c4 with several iterations,\" and \"a sentence x is mapping from some sequence of tokens.\" Additionally, there are numerous spelling errors, such as on page 2, \"we also conduct heuristics experiments on defensing hazard hallucination attack,\" heuristics -> heuristic, defensing -> defending against. I suggest the authors proofread the paper carefully to make it more readable for the audience.\n\n\n[1] Shin et al., AutoPrompt: Eliciting Knowledge from Language Models with Automatically Generated Prompts, EMNLP 2020\n\n[2] Zou et al.
