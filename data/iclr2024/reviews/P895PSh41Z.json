For instance, in Lemma 1, formula 1 and formula 2 look identical, I had thought that formula 1 might have been inadvertently repeated.  But it turns out there are slight differences. I think there should be a better presentation such as using the absolute difference is bounded. Furthermore, the content of Lemma 1 raises questions for me.  The textual description seems to discuss the relationship of the policy's value learned from two different properties of P_B.  However, the formula appears to depict the policy's value learned from U and P_B.  I hope the authors recognize this distinction.  One refers to the value function learned under a specific P_B, while the other pertains to the average value function learned on U.\n\n2. While this paper offers a plethora of proofs and new definitions, it lacks a coherent logical thread to effectively connect them. Additionally, the absence of adequate textual explanations for the theorems and lemmas makes the paper hard to follow and comprehend. There is no formal problem formulation for the problem the paper wants to solve. A more structured approach and clear expositions would greatly enhance its readability.\n\n3. This paper introduces the concept of the Relaxed State-Adversarial Transition Kernel. However, the name doesn't seem to genuinely capture the essence of this transition kernel. I'm uncertain where the \"State-Adversarial\" aspect is present. The approach of crafting a new transition kernel using a linear combination appears to be already employed by many robust RL under model uncertainty methods, such as the R-contamination uncertainty set. You may check this paper \"Policy Gradient Method For Robust Reinforcement Learning\"."

Firstly, the authors do not compare their work with state-of-the-art algorithms such as SAC-N, EDAC [1], and LB-SAC [2]. Even when implementing the algorithms based on https://github.com/tinkoff-ai/CORL, this paper's results are inferior to previous methods in most Mujoco and Adroit environments. Hence, I believe there are significant limitations in the paper's empirical contributions.\n\n3. Figure 2 should clarify the color codes representing different algorithms and indicate the corresponding perturbation magnitudes. The paper should explain how optimal state perturbations were determined in the robustness analysis. The connection between the state perturbations in the experiments and the real-world environments, as claimed in the paper, seems tenuous.
