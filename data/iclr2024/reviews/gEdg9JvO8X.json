To mitigate training fluctuation or collapse and stabilize the evaluation of learned policies, this paper introduces stochastic weight averaging of policy checkpoints. Experiments on MuJoCo tasks from D4RL demonstrate that the proposed BDQL-SWA provides good performance without policy constraints."

Also, it is only validated empirically, without theoretical analysis.\n2. The performance of BDQL-SWA on MuJoCo tasks still trails behind modern offline RL methods.\n3.

In offline scenario, the performance of BDQL-SWA is still not good enough. \n3. In SWA, the author mentions ``SWA averages the multiple checkpoints during the optimization''. Do you mean averaging the parameters of the models at different training time? So it is similar to the Target Actor/Critic network trick in most offline RL methods?"

The author claims that the BDQL has sufficiently solves the offline RL problem (OOD issue), and the OOD issue only causes fluctuation in training. The authors tries to illustrate this point with some ablation studies. However, this claim seems weak. It is suggested to add some theoretical analysis supporting this claim.\n3. Actually, the diffusion model is time-costly in model inference. Will this issue also occur in BDQL? Some ablation studies on computation issues are suggested. \n4.

The SARSA update requires the assumption that the offline data is coming from trajectories, and the data collecting policy is a single stationary policy. \n\n3. The choice of using SARSA to train the critic is actually confusing. According to the proposed algorithm, in the statistically asymptotical case, optimization is done perfectly, and offline data has good coverage, the critic will converge to the Q-function of the behavior policy, which might not be a strong policy, and the diffusion policy is just the argmax policy according to the Q-function of the behavior policy, which might be better than the behavior policy, but the performance is still not guaranteed. So it is hard to see why even in the most ideal setting this algorithm would return a strong policy.\n\n4. The argument on regularization for ood from the current algorithm is not very convincing. It seems like an alternative way of regulizing with behavior cloning with a diminishing regularization coefficient. Using this perspective, one can also suspect if this varying objective is causing the instability in the practical performance. \n\n5. No concrete algorithm box is provided. \n\n6. The usage of the term \"theoretical performance\" in the experiment section is confusing."
