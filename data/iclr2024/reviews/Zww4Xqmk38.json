However, this assumption raises doubts as it prohibits anomalies from occurring in only one dimension.\n\n2. **Limitation 2**: The central idea appears to implicitly assume that labels are distributed uniformly across different classes. Consider a binary classification scenario where the major class has a significantly higher probability than the minor class, and the labels are determined by whether $x_{i} < s_{i}$. In such cases, the Hamming distance of the embedding of in-distribution test data may be small among them, primarily because most of the samples reside in the same leaf as the major class.\n\n3. **Regarding Experiments**: It is advisable to present the experimental results in the format \"mean \u00b1 std\" due to the inherent randomness of random forests.\n\n4. **Regarding Related Work**: Decision tree learning and random forests should be traced back to the works of Quinlan (1979), Breiman et al. (1984), and Breiman (2001).\n\nReferences:\n- Quinlan JR (1979) \"Discovering Rules by Induction from Large Collections of Examples.\" Expert Systems in the Micro Electronics Age.\n- Breiman L, Friedman JH, Olshen RA, et al (1984) \"Classification and Regression Trees.\" Chapman & Hall/CRC.\n- Breiman L (2001) \"Random Forests.\" Machine Learning, 45(1), 5\u201332."

The authors propose a mechanism called TOOD detection, which is a simple and effective tree-based method for detecting out-of-distribution (TOOD) samples. The TOOD detection mechanism works by computing the pairwise hamming distance of tree embeddings of the testing samples. These embeddings are obtained by fitting a tree-based ensemble model using in-distribution training samples. The authors highlight that their approach is interpretable and robust due to its tree-based nature. Additionally, the method is efficient, flexible across various machine learning tasks, and can be applied to unsupervised settings. The paper presents extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art out-of-distribution detection methods.

                "value": "The authors define OOD in the abstract, but such a definition may violate the main stream of the community. In my view, telling the difference between two distributions is more related to two sample test. While in OOD Detection,  we typically assume the ID and OOD distribution has been mixed, thus we need to tell data as ID and OOD cases instance/point wise. I think such a setting is more difficult than two sample test, making OOD detection remain a challenging task in the literature. It will be great if the authors can discuss about it. \n\nThe paper is not clearly written. I am not sure if the proposed tree based method uses original features in the input space or embedding feature given by the pretrained classifier. If the former is true, I am not sure if the tree based methods have enough capability to fit complex classification tasks such as CIFAR classification. Also, the computational complexity will be high (even built upon the high dimensional embedding features). If the latter is true, I am not sure if the learned embedding features are good enough in OOD detection, especially considering the reliance of strong assumptions in their theoretical analysis (see also in the below questions).\n\nA related question is about the strong assumption in Theorem 1. In the input space, especially for the complex image classification task, it is obviously not true. In the embedding space, since model cannot perfectly separate ID and OOD cases, it is still a strong assumption. Therefore, I cannot fully understand why the tree based method is superior over previous works such as distance based methods (KNN), MSP, Energy, among many others. \n\nWhy ensemble method can facilitate OOD detection, the theoretical analysis does not cover such an issue, meanwhile heuristic explanation and empirical evaluation  are not sufficient. Therefore, I think the authors should discuss more about why ensembling is critical for the suggested tree based methods. \n\nThe authors make another strong assumption that the calibration failures, which is the main cause of why DNNs fail in OOD detection, will not occur for tree based methods. I am not sure if it is true in the real world, and more evaluation and ablation should be provided. \n\nMore discussion about the hyper parameter setting and the choice of evaluation datasets should be discussed here. More experiments about hard OOD detection and wild OOD detection are also of the interest in the literature."
