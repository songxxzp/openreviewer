Treating open surfaces as entities floating on watertight surfaces is a novel idea with significant advantages over other methods that require unsigned distance fields (UDF). It leads to the development of a manifold signed distance field (mSDF) on the watertight template, which is a sound contribution.\n\nIn terms of quality, the methodology is well-described, and the authors offer a clear rationale for their Ghost-on-the-Shell (G-SHELL) implicit modelling approach. The paper also provides empirical evidence of the advantages of G-SHELL in tasks such as mesh reconstruction and generation, which enhances the overall quality of the work.\n\nThe paper is well-written and the contributions are cleary presented. The authors effectively communicate complex concepts.\n\nIn terms of significance, G-SHELL is a differentiable and efficient implicit representation for both watertight and non-watertight meshes which broadens its impact. Besides it has the potential to be easily adopted in computer graphics pipelines.  G-SHELL applications in reconstruction and mesh generation problems are notable. In particular, G-SHELL\u2019s enables reconstruction methods where the topology, material and lighting are jointly optimized which is crucial for scaning 3D assets from images. \n\nOverall, this paper presents an original, high-quality, clear, and significant contribution to deal with non-watertight surfaces and demonstrating practical applicability through empirical validation."

                "value": "G-SHELL inherits common disadvantages of implicit surface representation methods. Mainly, since it employs a regular grid, surfaces with high and unbalanced entropy will require many grid elements, which can be inefficient and limiting for real applications.  \n\nG-SHELL uses a marching cubes-like algorithm to extract the surface. Even though this method is highly parallelizable, it also represents a burden in computation compared to explicit methods.\n\nG-SHELL does not model self-intersecting and non-orientable surfaces."

                "value": "Regarding the experiments in mesh generation, G-SHELL is compared against other implicit  SDF based methods that can only represent watertight surfaces. Since the experiments are only conducted with a dataset of non-watertight surfaces (clothes), it is thus expected that G-SHELL is going to be better at the job than the rest of methods. How well MD w/ G-SHELL performs with watertight surfaces compared with MeshDiffusion?   \n\n\nPolyGen [40] is regarded on page 3 as ineffective for high vertex counts. Although this is probably accurate, it is worth clarifying in the paper that methods like PolyGen generate non-uniform meshes and use the vertices more efficiently than the regular grid used in G-SHELL.  Comparing vertex counts between the two methods does not seem fair. \n\n\nThe paper lacks experiments on real data, especially in reconstruction. It would be interesting to compare G-SHELL + differentiable rasterizers against the baselines based on volume rendering or even vanilla NERF + marching cubes. Do the authors plan to include such experiments in the camera-ready version?\n\n\nIt would be illustrative to visualize the watertight template being estimated jointly with the open surface in some of the experiments."

Palmer, D. Smirnov, S. Wang, A. Chern, and J. Solomon, \u201cDeepCurrents: learning implicit representations of shapes with boundaries,\u201d in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022, pp. 18665\u201318675.\n- T.

Hannemose, \u201cNeural Representation of Open Surfaces,\u201d 2023, doi: 10.1111/cgf.14916.\n\nThe exposition could use some polishing. In addition to general copy-editing, some details of the method require further elaboration. Most prominently, the mesh extraction algorithm, which is a main contribution of the paper, is described only very briefly in section 4.2, and the lookup table for G-shells is only explained pictorially in figure 3. It would be helpful to readers to include at least a little more explanation of what is going on in that figure and why (even if it has to go in an appendix or supplemental material).\n\nThe description of the generative modeling approach in the paragraphs following eq. (2) is unclear. What does \"unevenly weighted prediction\" mean? What is the na\u00efve diffusion loss, and what are you replacing it with? Why does predicting the linear interpolation coefficient instead of the value of $\\nu$ help? Is there any tradeoff in doing this? If the normalization of SDF values is an issue, would there be an advantage to using more general implicit functions instead? If you are going to extend MeshDiffusion, it would be helpful to include at least a brief summary of how that method works."

(1) sounds like it really promotes hole-closing. In any case, it requires more explanation. What does the parameter $\\epsilon$ do? How should one set it? The paper refers to \"topological holes\" but I assume what is meant here are boundaries, not handles.\n\nThe appendix lists many more loss terms with free parameters, and it is unclear whether all of these terms are necessary. As usual, it would be helpful to add an ablation study. Some of the descriptions of the loss terms are cryptic and could do with elaboration. E.g., how does (12) reduce \"floaters\" and \"inner geometry\"? Why do you need a second SDF regularization after imposing the eikonal regularization? Would it be helpful to include some form of eikonal regularization on $\\nu$ as well\u2014ideally taking the gradient along the surface?\n\n## Minor quibbles:\n- p. 2: \"generation modeling\" -> \"generative modeling\"\n- p. 3: What does \"validity value\" mean?\n- p. 4: referring to a curve as a \"2D mesh\" and a surface as a \"3D mesh\" is confusing. It would be better to say \"polygonal curve\" and \"surface mesh,\" respectively, or something similar.\n- p. 5: \"pose-processing\" -> \"post-processing\"\n- 6.2: \"winding number\" should really be \"generalized winding number.\" Also, I am not sure what it means to look at the generalized winding number on the surface when it is a function in the ambient volume that has a sharp jump at the surface."
