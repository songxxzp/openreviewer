The ablation studies are so weak, this paper proposes coil-attention, and coil representation learning. I was expecting ablation studies on those architecture components, instead of weighted losses, which is a trivial ablation study. \n\n3. Maybe I missed it, seems this work is not based-on unrolled networks. Therefore, I would assume there might be generalizability problems in terms of sampling patterns and others. The authors didn't make any analysis.\n\n4. The paper is poorly written, all the tables are not professional, I haven't seen any paper reports PSNR without decima, and the papers are so redundant, I can barely retrieve any information."
