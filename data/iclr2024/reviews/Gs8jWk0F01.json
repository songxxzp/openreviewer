For instance, the rationale behind the introduction of equations 1 to 5 is not clearly explained. Constraint 3 appears to define t_i^{cur} under various scenarios, but it requires further clarification.\n\n\nClarity, Quality, Novelty And Reproducibility\n\nI had a hard time understanding the notations, often having to refer back to previous pages or struggling to find clear definitions. Examples include mha, sha, D', X', and \u03c0_{j} (is it a set or a sequence of visited nodes?). \n\nBesides, the paper also contains multiple grammar issues, just to name a few:\nPage 3-4: \u201cHowever, the current DRL models that utilize the attention model rely on a fixed number of customer points throughout the solution and cannot adapt to these dynamic changes.\u201d\nPage 5: \u201cThe point with the highest probability il+1 is selected as the target point, which the vehicle travels directly to from the current point.\u201c\n\nFinally, I have concerns about the reproducibility of the paper due to the significant modifications made to transform the static VRP instance into a dynamic one."

The concept of \"dummy depots\" isn't novel, and the proposed re-optimization process could be perceived as potentially time-intensive. Furthermore, the adaptation of using AM for dynamic VRP seems relatively direct and incremental.\n* The experimental setup might benefit from scaling, as the current research is conducted on a rather limited size (with only 50 nodes), which might not sufficiently demonstrate the model's robustness.\n* The manuscript's style and structure seem more suited for a journal than a conference like ICLR. Moreover, there are areas in the paper that appear to be incomplete. For instance, some details and formulas seem to be missing or inadequately explained. Repetitive paragraphs are in Section 3 and there are various typos.\n* The design of action space might need reconsideration. In the context of dynamic VRP, it could be worth exploring whether vehicles should be permitted to wait at certain locations, anticipating the release of subsequent orders. This might enable more strategic route planning, taking into account potential future orders."

First, these are operations research (OR) contributions that ought to be evaluated by the OR community and not ICLR. But even if we accept them as thematically relevant, which they aren't, neither would be accepted in any OR venue in their current state. \n\nRegarding contribution (2): the methods are not even close to the state-of-the-art. In the NeurIPS meets EURO competition the organizers provide a method for solving such dynamic problems (admittedly with time windows, but removing those would be trivial) based on Vidal's Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS), which is the state of the art. It's relatively simple to extend the offline problem in a naive way to support the dynamic version. The approaches offered here are a decade behind the current state of the art. Another option would be to use Ulmer's approach to dynamic routing problems. The author's cite his work, so I am not sure why it is then forgotten by the time we get to the experiments.\n\nRegarding contribution (3): The mathematical model is not structured in a way that any OR journal would accept it without a serious revision. One could call it unconventional at best, i.e., the model is not a mixed-integer linear program (even though the problem is linear). There are good reasons for the standard formats used in the OR community, namely that they are easy to read and interpret, which this model is not.\n\nThe experiments are also rather weak: only randomly generated instances, and even the algorithm run times seem to be randomly chosen. Please see Accorsi et al. (2022) \"Guidelines for the computational testing of machine learning approaches to vehicle routing problem\". Furthermore, the extent of the experiments is very limited. There's no investigation of parameter sensitivity, ablation, etc. It is all missing."

                "value": "1. The paper is not well-written to judge the main contributions. For example, deep RL-based approaches have been proposed [A1,A2]. The algorithm has not made any comparison compared to the other existing deep RL-based work.\n\n2. The algorithm has not explained many things to get proper insights of the algorithm. We should not judge any algorithm's performance truly based on its performance rather how it is being developed (and the intuitions behind that). The reviewer did not get any intuition behind the algorithm. For example, the paper repeatedly mentioned about applying deep RL. What are the parameters for this deep RL problem? What is the reward? What are the transition probability models? How do those change dynamically? \n\n3. The paper uses attention model, what is the logic behind using it.\n\n4. The optimization problem in (1)--(5) is not clear. The notations have not been introduced before proposing the problem, hence, it is difficult to parse what it is doing. Besides, it contains another optimization problem as a constraint (in (2)), hence it is a bi-level optimization problem. How do the authors propose to solve this bi-linear optimization problem?\n\n\n[A1].
