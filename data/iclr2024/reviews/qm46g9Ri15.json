If Eq 4 is involved in inference stage, then one major concern is that the proposed method might not be easy to scale up in practice. Due to the requirement of precomputing text embedding  $T_y$ in Eq. 4 for each visual token similarity computation, this \u201ccross-attention\u201d based image embedding will have the same number of versions as the number of classes. This will limit the application when the number of classes is large. On the contrary, for CLIP, image embedding is not conditioned on text. \n\n \n\nI am not sure how the CLIP zero-shot and finetune attention maps (e.g. figure 1 (b)) plotted. Please explain. Considering CLIP training takes the last token as the image representation trained with a casual mask, its individual tokens are intentionally designed for such attention alignment. For a more convincing comparison, in CLIP finetune, the authors might want to use other pooling techniques after the last layers (e.g. average pooling) instead of using the last tokens. In this case, each visual token will be enforced to have better representation. \n\n \n\nIt is unclear to me what does \u201c$D-V$\u201d structure mean. How $G_{D-V}(X_i)$ is defined."

Specifically, I find it as a combination of existing techniques. \na)The attention alignment problem was already discussed in CLIP surgery (Li et.al 2023). The proposed technique follows very similar architecture and training protocol proposed in (Li et.al 2023) but replaces V-V-V structure with D-V structure. Although D-V structure is interesting, I don't see any advantages of using D-V structure compared to V-V-V structure (in terms of qualitative results in Fig 8). Authors claim that it can reduce computations but I would like to know the comparison in computation (GFLOPS/time) between V-V-V structure and D-V structure and also the quantitative results for V-V-V and D-V structure (if possible). I would also like authors to discuss the contributions compared to Li et.al 2023.\nb) Similarly using guidance form the text classifier of CLIP (i.e using pairwise class similarity to regularize training) was also proposed in B. I would like to know how is the proposed technique is different from the one proposed in B\n\n2) Computational complexity: Authors employ Siamese type of architecture for fine-tuning. This can increase the complexity compared to other simple methods like CLIPOOD or prompt tuning techniques like A, COOP, CoCoOP, MaPLe. I want authors to compare the number of parameters and also training/inference time with other techniques mentioned above.\n\n3) Ablation Study: It is not clear from the fig 3.a, the contribution of AAL and SLS (looks marginal). Similarly, the contribution of SLS compared to Label smoothing is not apparent in Fig 3d. It would be good to indicate the gain w.r.to the smallest bar.\n\n4) Presentation: The writing could be improved, specifically section 3.2. It is hard to understand the method from the current description\n\n\nA: MaPLe: Multi-modal Prompt Learning, CVPR 2023\n\nB: Improved Visual Fine-tuning with Natural Language Supervision, ICCV 2023"
