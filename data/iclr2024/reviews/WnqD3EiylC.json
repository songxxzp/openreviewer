                "value": "**Major**\n\n1. The paper frequently uses notation and terminology that has not been previously defined, and seems to assume some familiarity with quantum mechanics/quantum information theory. Reading this paper with backgrounds in information theory and in functional analysis, but not in quantum information theory, I think I was able to make the right educated guesses to understand most of what the paper is doing, but this guesswork shouldn't be necessary to read the paper, and I don't think this would be accessible to much of the ICLR community.\nSome examples:\n    1. Equation (2): What is $\\otimes$? It seems like an outerproduct, but it's not clear.\n    2. Bra-ket notation is used for inner products (e.g., in Definition 1 and Theorem 4) without any introduction. I happen to have heard of this notation, but have never seen it in a paper, and doubt many people in ICLR are familiar with it.\n    3. Theorem 5: It's unclear what the norms $||\\cdot||*$ and $||\\cdot||_{\\text{HS}}$ are.\n    4. Section 3, just before Definition 2, \"The Quantum counterpart of the Jensen-Shannon divergence (QJSD) between density matrices $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ is defined as... where $S(\\cdot)$ is von Neumann\u2019s entropy.\": What is a \"density matrix\"?\n    5. Page 4, First Sentence: The univariate function $H$ is never defined; only the bivariate cross-entropy function was introduced in Eq. (6).\n\n2. I don't understand the point of much of Section 2 (Background). For example, Theorems 1 and 2 are never referenced or related to the remainder of the paper. I suggest reducing some of this material to make space for (a) clear definitions of the notation used throughout the paper and (b) further motivation and details regarding the experiments in Section 5.\n\n3. The abstract and contributions section both claim that the paper presents consistency and convergence rate guarantees for the proposed estimators, but I couldn't find any of these guarantees in the paper. The only guarantee presented (Theorem 2) applies only for finite-dimensional feature representations ($D < \\infty$), so it doesn't seem to apply to the new estimators proposed.\n\n4. Given the lack of supporting theoretical results (previous point), I was not very convinced by the experimental results. All of them are on simple, mostly synthetic datasets. While RJSD does perform well on many of the tasks, the improvements are mostly small, and, more importantly, there is no discussion of *why* RJSD might perform better than other metrics on these tasks.\n\n5. Section 5.3 only presents the average power of various tests, and I didn't see any evidence that the tests obey their nominal significance levels.\n\n**Minor**\n\n1. Page 2, Second Bullet, \"An estimator from empirical covariance matrices.... Additionally, an estimator based on kernel matrices... Consistency results and sample complexity bounds for the proposed estimator are derived.\": It's unclear here which of the two estimators the consistency results and sample complexity bounds apply to. Please clarify the wording here.\n\n2. Page 5, just after Theorem 5, \"From this result we should expect RJSD to be at least as efficient as MMD for identifying discrepancies between distributions\": To give contextualize this statement, perhaps it should be noted that, among proper metrics between probability distributions, MMD is quite weak [RRPSW15, SULLZP18].\n\n**References**\n\n[RRPSW15] Ramdas, A., Reddi, S.

Is this done by scaling (i.e., replacing $K_X$ with $\\frac{K_X}{\\text{Tr}(K_X)}$)? If so, this should be clearer.\n\n3) Page 3, Last Two Sentences, \"Let $\\hat P_\\gamma(x)$ be the empirical kernel density function by a Gaussian kernel with scale parameter $\\gamma$. Dmitriev & Tarasenko (1974) demonstrate that $H(\\hat P_\\gamma)$ converges to $H(\\mathbb{P})$ as both, $N$ and $\\gamma \\to \\infty$, with probability one.\": I was quite confused by the meaning of $\\gamma$ here. Typically, for the kernel density estimate (KDE) to be consistent, the bandwidth (which I think of as synonymous with the \"scale parameter\") should shrink (approach $0$, not $\\infty$). Does \"scale parameter\" here mean the reciprocal of the bandwidth (i.e., the \"precision\" of the Gaussian)? Also, are there no additional assumptions required here? For example, consistency of the KDE requires that the bandwidth $h$ not shrink too quickly (e.g., $N h^d \\to \\infty$).\n\n4) Page 5, Equation (12): Typo: I think $D_{JS}$ should be $D_{JS}^\\phi$, correct?\n\n5) I don't understand why the exponential moving average (EMA) is applied in Section 5.1, as this doesn't tell us anything about the performance of RJSD and many of the baseline compared could similarly be modified to up-weight recent data.\n\n6) How exactly is the RJSD metric utilized for two-sample testing in Section 5.3? Usually, either a permutation test or an analytically derived asymptotic null distribution is used, but I didn't see any explanation of this."

On the one hand, it is easy to arrange. On the other hand, it seems that consistency results require **probability normalized** Gaussain kernels (i.e. integrate to 1, so the Parzen estimator would be a density), and these have $k(x,x) \\righrarrow \\infty$ with $\\gamma \\rightarrow \\infty$.    Thus it appears the method would not compute the true  JSD.  Please comment. \n Note that MMD does not have such problems. \n\nQ1.1)  \n\nI'm using $\\gamma \\rightarrow \\infty$ above to be consistent with the paper. However, for standard definitions of scale, one should have $\\gamma \\rightarrow 0$ instead. Is this a typo? What definition of kernel and scale is being used? \n\n\nQ2) \n\n\nIn the data generating experiment, the formulation (16) is not a GAN, as the authors note themselves. \nTo me, it is much more simular to a VAE, perhaps an Wasserstein VAE. Thus I'm not sure why a copmarison to GAN's is being made, these results do not seem to be  informative.  The comparson should be with VAE, and with MMD based ones such as InfoVAE. \n \nQ3)\n\n\n Results on two sample tests: \nIn Table 3, there is no clear advatage of RJSD-D, over MMD-D, as the gaps at (400,500) are very small. \n\nResults in Figure 4 do show an advantage of RJSD-D over MMD-D, but this is not a large advantage in almost all cases.  While it is interesing, this can hardly justify a new information notion. I'd suggest either performing additional experiments, or analysing the current ones in more detail, to see why RJSD performs better."

In my opinion, the key insight can be easily grasped by contrasting different summary statistics derived from finite-dimensional kernels or random Fourier features. One common approach for comparing distributions involves evaluating empirical mean embeddings using L2 distance or calculating Hotelling's t-squared statistics. In contrast, the proposed method suggests using the traces of the covariance matrix of random features. While a significant portion of the paper is dedicated to demonstrating that this approach indeed results in a valid divergence, it intuitively makes sense that the trace can serve as a useful summary statistic."

                "value": "This work introduces a divergence between probability distributions by embedding them into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) called the Representation Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RJSD). The proposed divergence satisfies symmetry, positivity and boundedness and is well defined. The RJSD is upper bounded by the standard JSD, a well studied object in information theory. The RJSD corresponding to a chosen kernel K involves the von Neumann entropy of the integral operators corresponding to these kernels.\n\nThe authors propose a computable finite sample estimator for the RJSD which involves computing the von Neumann entropies of some kernel matrices (which are dual objects to the aforementioned integral operators). As such the estimator is sound, since concentration properties of kernel integral operators have been well studied [1]. Furthermore O(n^3) is not insurmountable for a first probe to consider the usefulness of the divergence object considered.\n\nHowever the authors do not present any statistical properties of the estimator. Instead, they proceed to study a further approximation of this object based on Random Fourier Features (RFF) based approximates for the kernels. This approximation is somewhat limited in its scope, and does not particularly behave well when the problem dimensions is large. This is a serious confounder to the various conclusions drawn from later experiments in the paper, and needs sufficient ablation.\n\n[1] On Learning with Integral Operators, Lorenzo Rosasco, Mikhail Belkin, Ernesto De Vito, JMLR 2010"

                "value": "The RFF based estimator is perhaps discussed too soon. I would have liked to read the properties and performance of the kernel matrix based estimator when O(n^3) is not really prohibitive. Typically we are able to compute eigendecompositions of upto 20-30K samples easily on modern laptops.\n\nThe authors say the estimator is \"differentiable\" in the introduction. Is this for the RFF estimator or the kernel matrix estimator. The differentiability for the kernel based estimator is not clear, and would be good to clarify.\n\nThe writing has a lot of room for improvement. \nThe following notational issues bothered (and confused) me while reading this paper. \n1. curly brackets for {X, B_X} that defines measure space instead of the standard round brackets. Also appears above equation (8).\n2. M_+^1(X) is complicated. Can you use a simpler notation say \\mathcal{P} for the set of all distributions on (X, B_X)\n3. is it true that phi(x) = K(x, .) since you are saying H is the RKHS corresponding to K. if phi is mapping into H then i think phi has to be K(x,.). If that is phi(x) is in some other Hilbert space H' (not necessarily the RKHS H) such that K(x,z) = <phi(x), phi(z)>_{H'} then is this sufficient. if by phi(x) you indeed meant K(x, .) then please clarify. This would then mean that C_P is the integral operator of the kernel which is a well studied object. (see [1] in summary), and provide some background on this operator.\n4. \"For the bounded kernel ... and trace class\", is the boundedness only needed for the trace class? If so split this sentence into 2.\n5. Is E[ K(X, X)] < inf necessary for the relation E[f(X)] = <f, mu_P>. I think it would hold even otherwise, just that both sides would be infinite.\n6. In section 2.2 you say unit trace. Is this an assumption for everything that follows? Should all kernel matrices also be normalized to have unit trace? Regardless, if it is clear (or even nontrivial) as to what happens to the entropy when the trace is not unity, a clarification would be useful to the reader. I think this is the general relation: S(c * C_P) = c * S(C_P) + c * log (c). Please recall the fact that trace=1 is assumed anywhere else in the paper where that is used. Is the RJSD invariance to the scale of the kernel, eg if I use K1 = c * K, the RKHSs for K1 and K are the same but their norms are scaled versions of each other. How does this change the RJSD, if it doesnt make this clear.\n7. In paragraph on covariance based estimator. Is this phi same as the phi? If not please use a different letter. Next please write an equation that describes a shift invariant kernel. Unless that is used the formula for p(w) using Bochners thoerem is not clear because till then kappa is a bivariate function. Use a different function name in that formula to avoid confusion. Also state that w_i are iid samples from p(w). Also use a different letter for phi_w since phi is already used in Section 2.1 for something else. State at the end of this paragraph how to choose D (perhaps point to Theorem 2)\n8. Formally define entropy H and cross-entropy H(P,Q) otherwise Theorem 1 doesnt make any sense. Also is this differential entropy, please state this clearly. Differential entropy doesnt enjoy all the properties that entropy from information theory does. eg it can be negative.\n9. In definition 1 you use K(x,x)=1 but that is not true when you are using trace(C_P) = 1. Please make sure things are consistent here.\nNext in this definition, please use a different letter than P for the LHS. It is very confusing to see P both on the left and right side. This issue complicates things further when you are assuming some phi* exists in Theorem 3. Theorem 3 was incomprehensible and needs a significant edit after definition 1 has new notation for the LHS.\n10. In Theorem 3 which space does phi* lie in. Please again use a different letter here. phi has been overloaded by being used 3 times at this point in the paper.\n11. Theorem 5 has a ||.||* which is undefined. Here again you are using K(x,x)=1, does that clash with trace=1. Also formally define MMD_K clearly before stating the lemma. I feel Theorem 5 should just have 2 objects RJSD >= MMD. the other objects can be pushed to the proof.\n12. Avoid using pi1 and pi2, it would perhaps be easier to read with the N/(N+M).\n13. Section 4, is the omega in phi_w o f_w same for phi and w? It seems weird that the networks earlier and last layers have the same parameterization\n14. Figure 1, please mention that the black line is for the closed form expressions between the Cauchy distributions. Please also mention in the caption why the steps are appearing, ie, because you are manually changing the parameters of the distributions at those points. Related to this, please give full forms of the different estimators you have used. \n15. Figure 3, doesnt really add much value as such. What are we supposed to make of these letters? Are they good?\n\nThe comment about the kernel learning strategy is important, but mentioned in a fleeting manner. Please either elaborate on this or avoid it."
