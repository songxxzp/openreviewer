                "value": "General Approach:\nThis paper introduces a method of learning policies for sequential decisions that are justifiable to a (human) judge. The general technique is to use reward shaping, where the reward of an RL agent is determined jointly by the environment and by the judge, and parameterized by a coefficient that determines the balance between performance (determined by environment) and justifiability (determined by the judge). The novel aspect of the approach is the construction of the reward from the judge using a debate game. The reasons given for using a zero-sum debate game in extensive form is to ensure that (1) the evidence presented by the agent is sufficient yet concise, and (2) the argument (collection of evidence) should not be easy to refute by providing additional evidence to the judge.\n\nDebate Game:\nThe debate game is a zero-sum, perfect-information game between a baseline agent and an agent trying to learn more justifiable decisions, where the strategy space is composed of the evidence that each agent can introduce at each stage in the game, and the utilities/payoffs are determined by the judgement of the judge. Importantly, the number of steps in the game, and hence the size of the ultimate evidence set, is much smaller than the set of possible elements that can be added as evidence. The judge provides real-valued judgements J(action, evidence set). Two two agents each suggest an action, and then take turns introducing elements to evidence to justify their action, so they end up each introducing half of the evidence in the evidence set. The judge then judges each action with respect to the evidence set, and the agent whose action is preferred by the judge based on the evidence gets a utility of +1 (and the other -1). The reward from the judge is then proportional to the value of the game (or, rather, an approximation of it).\n\nAn empirical study is done on data for patients with Sepsis, including comparison to trainign with only environment-based and only debate-based rewards and agents who learn without an adversary."

My biggest concern are the ethical considerations that are not addressed. My review would be to accept if not for the severe ethical implications of the work that have gone unstated.\n\nMethodology and Presentation:\nThe model of the game seems more complex than necessary, and bakes in assumptions that don\u2019t have clear motivation. Specifically, both agents must provide equal amounts of information, in alternating fashion. Why not simply have a game where the justifying agent provides some number of pieces of evidence L and the adversarial (baseline or confuser) agent provides any number of additional pieces of information? What is the benefit of creating a game with L stages where the agents alternate with best response? The paper motivates the use of Nash Equilibria to ensure robustness against additional information, but no motivation is given for this multi-stage debate game instead of letting each agent make 1 move each.\n\nA missing benchmark is how often the benchmark and justifying agents choose the same action. This would be highly informative.\n\n\nUnless I misunderstand the methodology, the benchmark with the isolated agent does not seem entirely appropriate. The isolated agent is trained to provide L pieces of evidence and then tested in a setting where it provides L/2 and a confuser provides L/2. It is not surprising that it is vulnerable to a confuser that provides the evidence least-supportive of its L/2 pieces of information. A better benchmark would be to train the isolated in a setting where it only provides L/2 pieces of information, and then see how robust it is to the setting where L/2 adversarially selected pieces of information are added.\n\nIn Fig 2a and 3a-d, the clinician\u2019s performance is compared to the learned policies according to WIS. But why would WIS be a reasonable way to measure the performance of the real-world clinician based on clinical decisions?\n\nThe payoff function G is introduced, but it is never specified how it relates to the utility function U.\n\nThe use of the \u201cBradley-Terry model\u201d (based on the Boltzmann distribution) is never given a justification.\n\nAlso, in the real world, not all pieces of evidence have equal complexity to evaluate, not all combinations of evidence have equal complexity to evaluate.\n\nMinor Errors:\n\nTypo: (Section 3.1) \\gamma^{i} instead of \\gamma^t in multiple places\n\nTypo (Section 3.2):  after the definition of U the text uses J instead of \\mathcal{J}\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any need to introduce the notation \\mathcal{E}(n).

However, it seems as though it would be just as easily used (and perhaps more effective) to implement it for nefarious purposes. For example, consider a chatbot being trained to get victims to reveal private personal information. The chatbot seeks to learn a strategy that maximizes value from the information victims reveal and learns what information/evidence/text to provide the agents that seems most compelling to them. It provides the arguments that are most difficult for the victims to refute, and learns from the arguments others have provided as responses in the past. In that case the judge and the confuser are the same agent. The problem is that the \u201cperformance\u201d may be based on a nefarious objective, and ultimately the debate reward simply trains the justifying agent how to most effectively deceive the judge. One can imagine many more similarly nefarious scenarios that come from this reward-shaping approach, and learning to maximize justifiability in general. Without constraints, or formal statements about what information must be provided to ensure transparency, learning justifiability necessarily implies learning deception. Static methods like SHAP that do not try to learn justifiability do not pose a similar risk."

                "value": "This work describes a framework for producing RL agents which take \"justifiable\" actions. This is done by defining a \"debate game\" for a state and a pair of actions, in which two adversarial debaters (each representing one of the actions) take turns picking \"evidence\" (aka features or factors) from the state, each trying to maximize the chance that a synthetic \"judge\" which takes in all the evidence as input will rate their action higher. A justifiable action is thus an action for which the outcome of the action's debate game does indeed result in the judge rating the action highly. \n\nThe paper describes experiments performed in the RL environment of providing interventions for patients with Sepsis. The work compares a baseline (a standard RL agent trained to maximize reward in the environment) with the novel approach (an RL agent trained to maximize a combination of reward from the environment and reward from the judge's judgment of the result of the debate game for the chosen action vs. the baseline action). The optimal policies for the debate game are trained using self-play RL (the debate game is perfect-information). There is a dataset containing real clinicians' interventions in the Sepsis setting. The judge is trained to predict, for each state in the dataset, the clinician's actual action based on evidence which is sampled uniformly random from the available evidence.\n\nThe work is highly related to explainability. Its methodology is similar to research in learning pairwise preferences.\n\nMany experiments are performed, and there is ample discussion about motivations and future research.\n\n---\n\nPost-rebuttal period update: I originally rated this paper a 6. The authors addressed some comments I made, and performed additional experiments. If I could, I would raise my rating to something between 6, and 8 (but unfortunately such an integer does not exist). I still don't like that the experimental design doesn't exactly match the motivation, but the updated version more explicitly acknowledge this, and the paper is still an interesting proof-of-concept. Finally, with the addition of the new experiments, the paper contains so many experiments to investigate questions that one could want to know the answer to, that its value passes the bar for publication. Therefore, I decided to break the tie between 6 and 8 by rating the paper an 8."

I feel that the paper would be stronger with at least human evaluations, if not human preference data for training.\n  - Also, the abstract says that \"we showcase that agents trained via multi-agent debate learn to propose evidence that is resilient to refutations and *closely aligns with human preferences*.\" Which human preferences is this referring to? Does it just mean that the actions taken are similar to the actual clinicians' actions? Does this presuppose that clinicians' actions == justifiable actions? If so, is this stated anywhere?\n\n\n\nMinor:\n\n- The definition of the Preference Dataset (Section 4.1) seems strange: the preference indicates which of the two decisions is more justified by a given set of evidence in a particular state. But what is that set of evidence? Shouldn't that evidence be included in the tuple? Indeed, in the experiments, the preference dataset used does not fulfill this definition, since $p$ simply indicates the actions that the real clinicians took, not the action that they thought was more justifiable given the (sampled at random) evidence.\n\n\nNitpicks:\n- Perhaps footnote 3 is important enough to not be a footnote. I was searching for a bit to figure out where $a^B_t$ came from in the experiments.\n\n---\n\nI think this paper isn't perfect but it's a good proof-of-concept of an interesting idea, so I recommend it for (borderline) acceptance."

If I'm reading the results correctly, they yielded lower performance, so maybe something like \"while being nearly as effective as [the baseline]\" or \"while barely sacrificing any performance\" would be nice.\n- Shouldn't the description of the Baseline Agent (Section 3.1) indicate that the baseline agent is learned and therefore in practice the baseline agent is approximately optimal, but not necessarily exactly optimal?\n- In the definition of the Justifiable Agent (Section 3.1), I think it would be helpful to explain what $a^B_t$ is. Even though it's described in the next section, it would clarify the dependence of $r^d$ and thus $R_J$ on the baseline agent's policy right away.\n- Debate Game (Section 3.2): I'm just curious: Did you consider defining U to be the difference between the judge's judgments instead of the binary +1, -1? If you did, why did you choose not to use it?\n- Using uniform random evidence to train the judge is surprising at first. Do you think it works well? Are there any alternatives? (can you keep training the judge in a loop while the argumentative agents train, perhaps?) An ideal dataset would actually include pairs of action + evidence, and human rankings over those, right?\n- Creating the synthetic dataset by comparing a random action with the clinician's action seems like it would result in a lot of pairs in the dataset where one action is clearly superior to the other. Is this true? Does this cause any issues?\n- In Section 5.4: \"not only can agents significantly amplify the capabilities of a judge, but they also manage to recognize and correctly convince it of its true underlying preference\" -- what are those two clauses referring to? I can't see how they're different.\n- Section 5.4: Am I reading correctly that the isolated argumentative agent is trained with L = 6, yet in this setting it's only allowed to submit 3 evidences? How does that work (does the isolated one just pick 3 without regards to the choice of confuser, while the confuser picks 1 evidence after each isolated choice)? Wouldn't it be more correct to train it with L = 3?"

                "value": "This paper considers the problem of designing RL agents that can provide evidence supporting their chosen actions ('justification') to a human observer - an important and timely problem that has not received enough attention. The authors propose an approach where a zero-sum debate extensive form game is played out between two agents, each attempting to convince a human judge (or proxy model) that their chosen action is most justified, by selecting 'evidence' (a subset of the state-space) to support the chosen action, contingent on the current state. The result of the human judge proxy model is a reward term which is mixed with the environmental reward, leading to an RL policy that trades off environmental reward and justifiability, as encoded by a dataset of human pairwise rankings of evidence proposals.\n\nThe paper is well written, with some minor grammatical errors. The proposed method is interesting and novel to my knowledge, and seems like a promising approach toward explainable RL policies. The empirical experiments are deep, but consider only one dataset - a medical problem of sepsis treatment. I have left some extensive comments and questions - but this is not a reflection of a weak paper, instead, this is due to my interest in the proposed method. The authors appear to be breaking new theoretical and empirical ground, and to this end the paper seems like a solid first effort in a promising direction.\n\nI'm familiar with single-agent RL (specifically, my background is Inverse Reinforcement Learning), but might be unaware of some prior literature that would be relevant when performing my review. I read the main paper and appendices carefully. I have not carefully checked any theoretical derivations."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* The method appears to require explicit knowledge of the optimal deterministic policy (called the baseline policy $\\pi_B$ as part of the debate framework (unless I have misunderstood something). This seems like a big limitation in terms of practically applying this method to larger-scale problems.\n * Sec. 4.2 mentions that the judge proxy model follows a 'Bradley-Terry' model (and provides a citation). This seems like an important point in the design of your method, but I'm not familiar with this model or the background or history here. Can you elaborate on why this model is chosen?\n * The training of the justifiable agent (and the argumentative agent) appears to use offline i.i.d. sampling of (s, a, a) tuples (Sec 4.3). This seems like it could pose over/under-representation problems for some MDPs with deep trajectories that might be less or more common (i.e. problems where the i.i.d. assumption is more heavily violated by the dynamics). Can you comment about this limitation of the method?\n * Due to the additional structure of the debate game, the method introduces a number of additional hyper-parameters (e.g. evidence size $L$, mixing coefficient $\\lambda$, scaling coefficient $\\alpha$, as well as architecture of the various policy models, to say nothing of the learning algorithm hyper-parameters. Because of this, evaluation on one or more additional MDP problems would strengthen the evidence for the efficacy of this method."

            "questions": {
                "value": "# Comments and questions\n\n * The use of an evidence-proposal debate setup for explainability is interesting and seems really promising to me. It seems like some deeper connections could be drawn to prior literature on the philosophical merits of debate as a form of explainability though. For instance, I'm curious about the following questions;\n   * Why did you choose to have a multi-step debate framework, rather than a single step of evidence proposal? What is the interpretation or significance of the trajectory through the debate game tree (is there any?), or is the reached leaf node the only relevant outcome of the debate?\n   * Similarly, how is a human RL designer or domain expert to interpret the proposal of multiple pieces of 'evidence' at each step of the debate game. If I understand correctly, evidence data are individual entries from the state-space vector (I think?). Is the interpretation of multiple pieces of evidence supposed to be a Boolean AND combination of each entry? (e.g. state feature A is present, AND B is present, therefore my action is better than the baseline policy)? I think a rich area for future exploration would be more structured evidence formats - e.g. \"A is present, and C is present, but B is not present, therefore action X is chosen\". Qualitative evaluations with domain experts would be beneficial in exploring this too.\n * There seem to be similarities between the debate-judge model and actor-critic RL approaches. Do you see any connections here? Could the proposed method be connected theoretically with A-C RL methods?\n * Similarly, as you note, the debate framework seems to have connections with pairwise preference ranking (e.g. Christiano et al. 2017). Given the popularity of RLHF at the moment, it might be illustrative to dig into the connections between this method and RLHF some more.\n * Fig 1. It appears that the baseline policy $\\pi_B$ never acts in the environment - is this correct?\n * The paper refers to the debate-based reward approach as 'reward shaping' several times - please be careful with this term. Reward shaping refers technically to a specific subset of reward transformation that value functions are invariant to (see [A]). Although people often do abuse this term to refer to arbitrary designer interventions to alter environmental reward, it is best to be more careful with the terminology here to avoid confusion.\n * I note the judge reward $J \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is unbounded - this concerns me as a infinite range within which to rank items poses difficulties for a human judge (see psychology and human factors literature for example). Does your method still work with bounds on the judge reward? E.g. $J \\in [-1, 1]$?\n * Can $\\pi$ and $\\pi_B$ output the same action and/or evidence? What happens in this situation? Is the judge proxy model able to output a 'no preference for either' choice?\n * Sec 4.4 mentions self-play is used during training. However I thought the agents being trained are deterministic. How can self-play be used in this case?\n * A compelling goal for future work would be the design of sample-efficient methods for specific MDPs that can operate with actual human-in-the loop judgements, rather than a proxy model.\n * The Sepsis reward design (App. B.3 is important - please provide references for the choice of $C_0, C_1, C_2$.\n * Given the specificity of your empirical experimental case-study, it would be helpful to have some more elaboration of the nature of the problem of sepsis control in the Appendix. I also assume the authors have some prior work or expertise or domain knowledge in this area. It would be beneficial to state if this is the case in the appendix to demonstrate that the research is being undertaken by an appropriately credentialed and/or experienced team (i.e. not computer scientists pretending to be doctors).\n\n# Minor comments and grammatical points\n\n * Sec 3. - The MDP specification is missing a starting state distribution.\n * Sec 3.2 Why does $a_t$ act first in the debate game, not $a^B_t$. Did you test the reverse design?\n * You set the hyper-parameter $\\alpha = 5$ in your experiments - why this value? Were other values tried?\n * Fig 3. caption - please define WIS so the reader doesn't have to refer to the main text.\n * App. B.2 - I believe you mean to say \"setting the [log] probability of presented arguments to negative infinity\".\n\n# References\n\n * [A] Ng, Andrew Y., Daishi Harada, and Stuart Russell. \"Policy invariance under reward transformations: Theory and application to reward shaping.\" Icml.
