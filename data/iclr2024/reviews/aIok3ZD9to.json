If that is the case, why? Because that hardware is not just used for running LLM workloads; it is. probably used for running other workloads as well. In my humble opinion, the embodied carbon -- in the case of LLMs -- should represent the carbon emitted during the training, as trained model is the main product/output of LLM. What do authors think about this?\n\n2) It is not immediately evident to me how carbon (emission) factor is accounted for in this modeling. In principle, this coefficient is location dependent and consequently depending on where you are ruining your LLMs, you should get a different carbon footprint. Can the authors clarify that?\n\n3) While I appreciate the importance of carbon modeling of LLMs, it is not clear from this work i) whether the paper is relevant to ICLR as it does not address any core topic in learning, and ii) how it can be used for optimization purposes."

Much of the equations and parameters of the equations are based on prior work. Is the contribution of the paper to sum up carbon numbers from prior work equations? \n- There is no measure of utility of an LLM. For example, one can reduce the emissions by increasing test loss, but a high test loss can lead to poor performance which cannot be used in the real-world. It'll be interesting to measure the utility across classical ML models such as those used for classification, regression, translation, etc. \n- It would be good to discuss the utility of the measurement tool.
