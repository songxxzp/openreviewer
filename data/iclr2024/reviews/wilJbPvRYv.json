The authors claimed that $f(T, c, i)$ is the portion of time client $i$ participated in AsyncFL. If the training process takes time $A$ and during the $A$ time interval, client $i$ participated in the training process for $B_i$ time units, then I would think that $f(T,c, i)=B_i/A$. However, with this definition, I cannot understand why in Appendix A, $f(T,2,1)=f(T,2,2)=1$ when $T=$\\{$ t_1,t_2$ \\}. Moreover, I also don't understand why $f(T,c, i)$ is irrelevant with $k$.\n\n2. The expression of some terminologies is not accurate. For example, the number of updates given by other clients during the training and communication of node $i$ is not precisely the quantity in Eq (4), and the quantity in Eq (4) only tells the of updates given by other clients during the $0$th update and the $1$th update of node $i$.\n\n3. I understand that for simplicity, the authors treat delays or the number of updates as continuous variables, rather than discrete variables. However, since these quantities themselves are discrete, the authors should at least mention this in the paper."

The formulations for time and resource consumption assume that the syncFL and asyncFL reach the target accuracy after p rounds. How do we determine the number (p) of updates until target accuracy is achieved? In addition, the authors' formulation assumes that the time (T = {t_1,t_2,...,t_n}) required by the clients to download, train and upload the model weights are constant across training rounds. The assumption of T being constant across rounds may not reflect reality because a client model can be faster in certain rounds and slower in others. \n\n-- In section 4, the authors conclude that, based on their formulations, neither syncFL nor asyncFL can be deemed to be definitively superior to the other.

The authors have shown that their approach of determining resource and time utilization for asyncFL closely approximates the actual values, however since this does not establish a connection with previous works that have opposing views, it does not invalidate the previous authors' works which determines that either asyncFL is better than syncFL, or vice versa. Figures 3c and 3d do not justify that the authors' formulations are also accurate when predicting time and resource usage for other aggregation schemes. Those figures do not compare the formulations' predictions of time and resource usage to real ones, instead, they simply show the predictions when using the authors' formulations.\n\nWriting Issues:\n\n* Figure 1 has missing legends, making it incomprehensible to the readers. The figure is critical to the paper as it intends to show that neither syncFL nor asyncFL approaches can be deemed to be definitively superior to the other in regards to reducing time and resource consumption. The authors mention that Figure 1 is a comparison of asyncFL and syncFL in terms of their resource and time utilization, however, it appears that the figure is incomplete and does not compare the two approaches.\n\n* What is D-bar in section 5, under \"Contribution Scaling on a Client Dataset\"?"
