                "value": "1. Lack of technical novelty. All technical components have been established in the prior works, such as FlexMatch [1], Dash [2]. Specifically, Sec 4.1 -> [3]; Sec 4.2 -> [2, 4]; Sec 4.3 -> [1]. \n2. Lack of literature review. This work missed a couple of important baselines to compare with. For example, the methods presented in [4,5,6,7, 8]. \n3. Lack of experimental design. This work only evaluated it on FixMatch. However, in other pieces of literature [3,5,6,8], they evaluated on various SSL algorithms to show the effectiveness of the method, such as MixMatch and ReMixMatch. It would be helpful if the authors can present the results of these SSL algorithms. Moreover, FixMatch was proposed three years ago. It would be interesting to apply SEVAL to more recent algorithms, such as FlexMatch, CoMatch, or other SSL algorithms. \n4. The motivation is not clear to me. The main goal of SSL is to reduce the labeling effort. However, the experimental setting shows they still use a large amount of labeled data in the training data and a labeled validation set. FixMatch can achieve ~90% accuracy when only using 40 labeled data. It would be helpful if the authors could do experiments where the labeled data are scarce, e.g., 40 labeled data in total, while the unlabeled data can be highly imbalanced. \n5. The parameter is tuned on the validation set, which is not practical in my view. How do we prepare a labeled validation set in real-world scenario? If we have such labeling budget, why don't we choose other learning algorithms but stick to SSL? \n\n\n[1] Zhang, Bowen, Yidong Wang, Wenxin Hou, Hao Wu, Jindong Wang, Manabu Okumura, and Takahiro Shinozaki. \"Flexmatch: Boosting semi-supervised learning with curriculum pseudo labeling.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 18408-18419.\n\n[2] Xu, Yi, Lei Shang, Jinxing Ye, Qi Qian, Yu-Feng Li, Baigui Sun, Hao Li, and Rong Jin. \"Dash: Semi-supervised learning with dynamic thresholding.\" In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 11525-11536.
