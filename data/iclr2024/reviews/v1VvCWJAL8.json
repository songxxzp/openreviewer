The data generation mechanism used for creating data in these experiments is too simplistic. It consists of linear transformations followed by a leaky relu (I had to dig into a very long appendix to find this). The model also seems to have knowledge of the precise form of data generation mechanism (linear + relu), and only fits that form.\nTo me, the interesting experiments come in section 5.2. However, I can't find an explanation of how sparsity is enforced in these experiments.\nIn summary, I think authors can restructure the paper to provide more room for experiments in 5.2., and explain the methodology in detail."

In the above, *the structural functions are unchanged*. However, as indicated in my summary, the \u201cintervention\u201d and \u201ccounterfactual\u201d in this paper refer to totally different things, in particular, the \u201ccounterfactual\u201d does *not* consider the past values of exogenous variables which are the gist of \u201ccounterfactual\u201d. Explanations regarding these are necessary, and I strongly suggest *not* using the terms \u201cintervention\u201d and \u201ccounterfactual\u201d in this paper.\n\n*The \u201cgeneralized causal mechanisms\u201d in Prop 2 are only a subclass of \u201cinvertible SCMs\u201d*. There is no formal definition of \u201cinvertible SCMs\u201d in this paper; I think the definition should be like: writing the whole system of SCMs as X=f(\\epsilon) and function f is invertible. In the proof of Prop 2, it assumed that each $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$ is invertible. But this is not implied by the general concept/definition of \u201cinvertible SCMs\u201d I mentioned above, because there is no guarantee that the *subsystem* involving only $z_{<j}$ is invertible; information from other variables might be needed to invert the whole system, and missing any piece of information might render the subsystems non-invertible. Hereafter, I name this class of models *\u201cinvertible autoregressive SCM (IASCM)\u201c*.\n\n*The claim on the generality of the model class (Prop 1) seems problematic*. First, here the model class is IASCM. In the proof of Prop 1, the Rosenblatt transformation should be constructed for a fixed *sample point* of p(X), because each conditional CDF F_j should depend on fixed x_{<j}. Thus, we need a Rosenblatt transformation for each sample point, and we cannot construct the F_p and F_q for the whole distributions p(X) and q(\\epsilon). \n\nI have spent 3 hours to get around the confusion in the listed Weaknesses, and I can only skim the rest of the paper and ask some questions as below. *I will read the rebuttal and the revised paper again and update my review accordingly*."

Although the theory in the paper converts IASCMs on a set of domains into an easy-to-deal-with form that is the canonical ILD. There are no discussions on the identifiability of canonical ILDs, that is, when we really try to learn the canonical ILDs, can we identify the single eq class of canonical ILDs, which contains the true one? The practical application of the proposed idea depends critically on this question. \n\n*How can we understand if a practical dataset satisfies the theoretical setting*? Both high-level discussions and examples are highly desirable. For example, for MNIST datasets, how can we understand that the observable (image) is related to the latent by an injective mapping? Why the latent variables in different domains are related by invertible mappings? And in the end, what are the latent variables? Note that I do not require any precise claims on the causal structure (it is latent anyway), but even reasonable \u201cguesses\u201d would be very helpful.\n\nI think the 2nd equality of eq2 is also by definition?\n\nIn Def 3, point 3, I am not sure Gaussian exogenous noises are without loss of generality, any references and/or reasonings?\n\nShared observation function g should be explained right after Def 3.\n\nThe claim of \u201cboth counterfactually and distributionally equivalent\u201d in Theorem 2 looks strange to me. Can\u2019t we prove that counterfactual equivalence implies distributional equivalence?\n\nThere is a related work [1] that is worth mentioning; it also considers invertible causal mechanisms, shared function between domains, and transferability between domains.

While I agree that it may not be necessary to fully identify the true latent causal model for domain counterfactual estimation, I would appreciate a more intuitive explanation of Theorem 1 and its implications. For instance, it would be helpful to know which specific aspects of the true latent causal model need to be identified to enable domain counterfactual estimation. This could include considerations like the identifiability of latent noise variables, the size of the intervention set, or any other relevant factors. \n\n2) How should we precisely define the size of the intervention set, denoted as 'k'? In discussions about interventions or the number of variables subject to intervention, there is usually a reference to a latent causal model where no interventions have occurred. How do we accurately establish this reference latent causal model?\n\n3) One of the main contributions, in my view, pertains to the definition of the canonical domain counterfactual model. However, this definition might appear somewhat stringent, particularly with its requirement that only the last variables be intervened. Even though it's surprising that any Invertible Latent Domain (ILD) model can be transformed into an equivalent canonical ILD, could you provide some real-world applications to illustrate and justify the relevance and utility of the canonical domain counterfactual model?\n\n4) It appears that in order to enhance domain counterfactual estimation, one needs to have prior knowledge of the intervention sparsity, denoted as 'k.' However, in practical scenarios, obtaining this information can be challenging. While the experiments do offer some insights and analysis regarding the mismatch of sparsity between generative and inference models, could you provide further justification or reasoning for the selection of the appropriate value for 'k'?\n\n\nI would be willing to increase my rating if these concerns are addressed."
