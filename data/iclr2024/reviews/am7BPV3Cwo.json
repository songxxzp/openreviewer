                "value": "The paper studies the problem out-of-distribution (OOD) detection when original in-distribution (ID) data suffers from class imbalance. The authors first report an experimental observation regarding two major challenges in OOD detection under the studied setting: misidentification of tail-side ID samples as OOD (False positives) and of some OOD samples as head-side ID (False negatives). They then statistically compare the learning objectives in OOD detection with class-balanced vs. -imbalanced ID data, allowing them to attribute these challenges to the auxiliary bias term that does not cancel out in the class-imbalanced scenario. Based on this analysis, they propose two unique avenues to mitigate the influence of this bias term: post-hoc normalization and train-time regularization. Together, they form a cohesive framework for OOD detection with class-imbalanced ID data, dubbed ImOOD. The authors provide substantial empirical evidence for the effectiveness of ImOOD."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- I believe the major drawback of this paper lies in the limited scope of the studied problem. It appears that the authors assume that the class-imbalance problem only exists on the original ID dataset. I am not too convinced with the practicality of the proposed scenario; it\u2019s hard to imagine in what deployment scenarios only the ID dataset will suffer from this problem, while the OOD dataset(s) used for training/testing is void of it. Wouldn\u2019t it be more natural to assume that the ID training dataset can be refined in advance to make it class-balanced, while the OOD data the detector must be able to identify arise in various forms, and thus is more likely to be class-imbalanced?\n    - What if the auxiliary OOD dataset used for training and/or the target OOD dataset exhibits class-imbalance as well? I think it is important to study various combinations of class-balanced and -imbalanced ID/auxiliary OOD/target OOD datasets. Does the analysis performed in the paper extend to and hold in such settings? Can ImOOD still outperform other baselines?\n- Please correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the verification of post-hoc normalization (minus the train-time regularization) on larger datasets appears to be missing. Even on CIFAR10-LT, the improvement from post-hoc normalization seems marginal, but this concern could be alleviated, as long as the improvement is consistent across various datasets. If post-hoc normalization is not quite as effective on datasets, it would signify that ImOOD is heavily reliant on the train-time regularization.\n- More details on how the label distribution is learned (during test-time regularization) would be appreciated. Also, do you use the same learned label distribution when performing post-hoc normalization? Or is it used only for training-time regularization? If you discard it after training, one would have to know the label distribution anyways for post-hoc normalization, so do we really need to use the learned distribution in the first place?\n- The empirical validation is limited to one target OOD dataset per InD dataset. Validation on more challenging OOD datasets (e.g., near OOD data, data with spurious correlation) would be helpful to gauge the effectiveness of the proposed method."

It is a direct conclusion and seemingly to be important, but could the authors further connect these two cases to previous works that handle imbalanced data in OOD detection and the proposed ImOOD. For example, why previous works, such as [1], will fail to discern these two cases and why ImOOD can overcome previous drawbacks. \n\ng should be defined in a proper position in advance. It seems that g should be the detector built upon f.\n\nMy main concern lies in the inaccurate estimation of beta, consisting of three terms that are all biased from my view. For P(i|X), a direct failure case is that when we have a detector whose g always greater than 0 (e.g., for distance based scoring), then P(i|X) will be always greater than 0.5. Thus, all data points will be taken as ID cases, making the estimation obviously a biased case. P(y|x,i) also suffers from biased estimation, due to the well known calibration failure of deep models. Such an issue, from my view, cannot be ignored in the field of OOD detection, since it is one of the main reason why MSP score is not effective in practice. The estimation of P(y) is also biased, since the training time data distribution (ID + OOD) is different from the test situation, thus n_o used for training cannot cover the real test situation. \n\n\nDetailed discussion about the hyper-parameters setting and the choice of auxiliary OOD data and the evaluation datasets should be discussed in detailed. More methods that handle OOD detection with imbalanced data should be considered here, such as [1]. More ablation studies to test the respective power of P(i|x), P(y), and P(y|x) should be tested.\n\n\n[1] Detecting Out-of-distribution Data through In-distribution Class Prior."
