                "value": "This paper identifies a challenge for the approach of looking for subspaces corresponding to causal factors of deep neural network output.  It claims that activation patching and subspace patching approaches are at risk of an interpretability illusion where the patching fails to change the causal pathways actually leading to undesired input.  It develops the concepts of dormant pathways and causally disconnected pathways to explain why the interpretability illusion is possible.  The paper illustrates its model of the interpretability illusion using a toy example.  Furthermore, it presents real-life case studies.  One set of case studies focuses on language models, particularly the indirect object identification task.  For the IOI task, previous works have used activation patching to correct a network to output the indirect object of a sentence rather than the direct object.  The paper identifies an approach to the task, using distributed alignment search, that is subject to the interpretability illusion.  It also identifies an approach, using prior knowledge about the network to identify the nodes responsible for the error, that correctly patches the network.  The paper explains the difference between these approaches using the concepts of dormant and causally disconnected pathways.  Furthermore, the paper also studies factual recall in language models as an additional case study.  It presents a set of experiments where it shows that the vulnerability of activation patching to the interpretability illusion depends on the layer which is targeted.  The paper also includes some additional discussion on connections between activation patching and rank-one model edits."

                "value": "The paper does not pose an explicit hypothesis that can be falsified, limiting its scientific validity. Further, the \"illusion\" seems to make **problematic assumptions** and has unclear implications. \n\n- The hypothesis seems to be that every patched subspace \u201cv\u201d discovered by DAS can be decomposed into two directions \u201cv_disconnected\u201d and \u201cv_dormant\u201d (with specific properties), and that \"patching along the sum of these directions, the variation in the disconnected part activates the dormant part, which then achieves the causal effect\". The latter statement assumes that the model behaves somewhat linearly along these subspaces (i.e., the output of the model along direction \"v\" is given by a sum of its outputs along \"v_disconnected\" and \"v_dormant\"), which is a strong hypothesis given that these models are fundamentally non-linear. While the paper provides some evidence for the existence of some \"disconnected\" and \"dormant\" directions, unfortunately, I do not see evidence justifying the apparent linear behaviour of the underlying model.\n\n- The definition of the \"dormant\" subspaces is confusing in the context of this work. If the model output remains unchanged for in-distribution patching and changes only for out-of-distribution samples $x,y \\sim \\mathcal{D}$, what procedures presented in this work result in out-of-distribution samples/activations? As far as I can tell, all procedures described involve patching with in-distribution data.\n\n- Is the hypothesis that such a decomposition does not exist for \u201ctrue\u201d subspace directions?\n\n---\n\nThe paper (especially sections 4-7) is difficult to read, is very dense, and has **several omitted details**. \n\n- The main paper on its own does not seem to be self-contained and seems to contain a significant number of references to the appendix. \n\n- The main hypothesis involves the claims that (1) subspace directions can be decomposed into two directions (disconnected, dormant) with specific properties, and (2) the effect of such directions adds somewhat linearly to the model outputs. However, the paper fails to connect this terminology (\"disconnected, dormant directions\") in sections 4-7, making it difficult to verify whether the experiments confirm or deny the hypothesis. \n\n- The writing and presentation are sloppy. For example, in Section 4, \u201cker W_out\u201d is never defined, and it is unclear how the results in Table 1 and Figure 3 relate to the description in section 4.3. What is ABB / BAB in Figure 3? What does \u201cconnected\u201d in Table 1 refer to? Overall, how do Table 1, Figure 3, and Figure 4 illustrate support for the presented hypothesis?\n\n---\n\nOverall, while this work may present a useful point, its writing (especially sections 4-7) makes it impossible to verify this. I suspect that a thorough rewrite is necessary to clarify its central point."

What are the use cases for identifying model components (neurons/subspaces) responsible for model behavior? What evaluation metrics are available to test whether the components have been correctly identified?\n\n- Do these results for subspace activation patching also hold for usual activation patching? It seems like subspace patching is a generalization, and thus it must, and also I see that the toy example is given for the case of usual activation patching, but the experimental results and the paper's messaging are specific to subspace patching."
