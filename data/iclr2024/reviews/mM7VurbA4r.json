It is well-motivated, clearly written, well-organized and rather complete. \n\nI like the focus on real social interactions, the careful design to promote a diversity of testing scenarios along several axes and the careful definition of the evaluation protocol. This framework appears easy to extend with more complex interactive scenarios (eg multi-player) and more evaluation dimensions, which makes it very useful. \n\nThe study of GPT-4's ability to conduct evaluations is interesting. It appears that its capacity to do so is currently limited, but it's good to have a methodology to measure it, so future work can improve on it and measure these improvements reliably. \n\nThe paper consistently answered questions I had while reading earlier paragraphs, which is a pretty good sign of the quality of its structure."

The results seem to say that GPT4 is rather good at evaluating the goal dimensions and 2 others when it comes to the behavior of other models, but the paper then states \u201cPutting these observations together, we conclude that, with some caution, GPT-4 can be used as a proxy to human judgments for evaluating model performance on most dimensions and for human performance on the GOAL dimension.\u201d --> is 3/7 'most'?\n\nIt sounds to me that it's not bad but also not working so well. Should we use it? Probably not. The authors point out possible biases that might interfere with the ratings, but since they are not studied here it's hard to tell where and when they might play. I think this is fine to say it's not ready yet, but argue that the evaluation protocol is a strong contribution that will help us track progress in that direction. For this reason, I think the authors should commit to release the dataset of interactions between models and human judgments so it can be used as training/testing data to support further research in developing better automated evaluations approaches. \n\nMore generally, since it's a benchmark paper, it should be written somewhere what will be released publicly. Ideally we'd like to see a release of: 1) the codebase to run these experiments, 2) an easy to use way to plug a new language models, define other models it could interact with to get the final (automatic) evaluation score, 3) interaction data across models and with humans, 4) human judgments, 5) GPT4 judgements;; basically all code and data. Please be explicit as to what will or will not be released. The quality of this work will be directly correlated to the amount of things released that can be useful for others. Indeed, benchmark papers that don't release anything are pretty useless. \n\nThe discussion of limitations should probably be part of the main paper and not hidden in the appendix. \n\nCould you provide an estimate of the number of calls made to the API and the resulting costs? It's interesting to see what budget these kind of experiments lead to. Eg: how much would it cost to evaluate a given agent in SOTOPIA using GPT4 evaluation? etc.\n\nMinor comments:\n* \u201cIn the following paragraphs, we itemize all seven dimensions in SOTOPIA, each with a score range in [lower bound\u2013upper bound] form, the explanation, and the literature inspire us.\u201d \u2192 grammar issue in the end of the sentence\n* Table 2: \u201cThe best performance for each dimension is bolded when significant.\u201d \u2192significant does not mean much in itself. What is significant here? The null hypothesis (difference in means? medians? two-by-two?), the level of confidence and the statistical tests used should be stated.\n* couple of typos here and there"

            "questions": {
                "value": "This is a mix of questions and suggestions.\n\n* It could be interesting to have studies that vary single dimensions of the interactive tasks at a time and see the impact on the various evaluation metrics: eg simply vary the relationship between the two players; or vary one personality traits; or vary the goal etc. Does each variation lead in the expected shift in the conversation?\n\n* Did you ask humans to guess whether they interacted with an LLM or a human? Since LLM answers are longer and always repeat the previous point, humans might guess it's an AI and we know humans usually have a negative AI bias that could lead to different behaviors in both cases. eg: do humans perform higher again humans or gpt4 and is this simply due to the quality of the other player or to a negative AI bias? Could you reproduce this effect by asserting that the other player is AI or human whereas it's always an AI?\n\n* Why is there a gap in Table 1 (human + sec)\n\n* why not normalize and rescale measures between 0-1 to make the table easier to read?\n\n* Why is the pairwise performance in Figure 3 not symmetric?\n\n* It would be interesting to study how robust are humans / AI to adversarial humans trying to get them to score lower on the benchmark dimensions. I'd expect AI to be quite sensitive to human behavior in these interactions and to be thrown off quite easily. \n\n* It would be interesting to discuss how to make LLM better on this benchmarks. eg suggesting that we could run these interactions, evaluated them with GPT4, then finetune the model on successful interactions, repeat that and see how performance improves with iterations?\n\nConclusion of the review: I think this paper is very good and will be a good basis for future research IF most things are released. I condition the score I'm giving now on the author adding a statement listing what will be released publicly."

This paper shows that GPT-4\u2019s evaluation of social interactions is similar to the human evaluation scores. The authors performed experiments on several LLMs accompanied by human evaluations in the SOTOPIA-EVAL framework. The results show that GPT-4 performed best among most dimensions compared with other LLMs. But when evaluating on SOTOPIA-hard tasks, GPT-4 still falls short of human performance in terms of goal completion rate and struggles to demonstrate social commonsense reasoning and strategic communication skills. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that SOTOPIA can serve as a valuable tool for assessing the social interaction abilities of both human and model agents."

So it is unclear whether the evaluation using GPT-4 is biased or not.\n- SOTOPIA-EVAL introduces a multi-dimensional framework that utilizes different scores with hand-crafted ranges. However, there is no quantitive explanation/definition for those metrics. According to the prompts, only the positive/negative and higher scores are described, so the scores are not presented to the LLMs like the Likert scale presented to human evaluations and appear to be heuristic in nature. \n- Some of the evaluation metrics are not really related to social intelligence. For example, believability can be just the ability to create fluent dialogue, it doesn\u2019t need to be meaningful social interactions, and social rules can be just memorizing the patterns, it doesn\u2019t capture the agent\u2019s ability to understand the social scenarios."
