Though without references, I can understand some reasons described by the authors why only considering discrete representations, since some underlying latence of humans could be discrete such as gender, and continuous representations can be translated into discrete. However, the authors state that the discrete formulation allows for a more nuanced representation of individualized latent, which is lack theoretical and empirical evidence. If that is an assumption, I would also recommend such strong assumption to be clearly formulated and described in main content, given it plays a key role in the methodology.\n\n2.\tDesign of methodology is not well motivated, and some parts lack details. For example, (a) The motivation of choosing VAE to estimate individual-specific factors, and the motivation of state reconstruction are not clear. The part of feature extraction is not introduced in overview, and the definition of features, and the reason of utilizing feature extraction, are not clear. (b) The proposed method relies on subgrouping of individuals to obtain embedding dictionary, while the part of subgrouping is highly vague in paper and lack thorough motivation and details. For example, (a). There is no reference regarding the motivation of such design, and reasons of choosing the specific subgrouping measure. (b) q is not included in pseudocode. Specific measures to obtain q and how q is determined in experiments are not clear.\n\n3.\tDesign and details of experimental are not clear, which hinders the evaluation of proposed method and reproducibility. Some important details, such as: for synthetic experiments, the goal of the task, how the synthetic datasets are conducted, definitions of states, actions, and rewards, why only 100 samples are generated, how the unobserved latent L and noise are simulated, as well as the reasons of design such synthetic environment without considering existing broadly used environments (e.g., Adroit, Mujoco), especially human-involved ones. For persuasion for good environment, objectives, states, actions, and rewards are not formally defined. Definition of relevant information from the dialogues using the BERT is not provided. \n\n4.\tGaps exist across motivation, methodology, and experimental design. (a) The major work is motivated by complex human-related scenarios, and it is comprehensive that the paper described a lot of educational and healthcare scenarios in major content. But the experimental environments are mainly simple without well-designed human factors as described in motivation. There is one human-related environment used in experiment, i.e., persuasion for social good in the dialogue system. But details of experiments are missing too much for me to thoroughly evaluate the proposed method. (b) For compared methods, it would be more persuasive if they contain: (i) Population level component with the framework, e.g., learning population level embeddings and reconstructing states, so that the effectiveness of learning individualized factors can be isolated to evaluate; (ii) Different state reconstruction methods such as trajectory transformer, GAN, etc. Otherwise, a clear motivation of current baseline selection and choices of utilized techniques in methodology need to be justified. (c) As what I described in (2), motivations are lack in each step of methodology, hinders a thorough evaluation regarding the proposed method.\n\n\nMinor:\n-\tCaption of Figure 3(a): \u201cXX\u201d looks like a placeholder.\n\n-\tLimitation should be discussed. A possible limitation is that the individual-specific factor L is assumed to be static over time, while another common fact is that many unobserved factors related to humans can evolve over time (e.g., [1-2]), such as mental status, and affect human behaviors.\n\n\n[1] Feng, F., Huang, B., Zhang, K., & Magliacane, S.

                "value": "The paper examines the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in personalized settings such as healthcare and education, where individual differences significantly impact the outcomes of RL agents. It addresses the challenge of identifying individual-specific factors that influence state transitions, which are often hidden (latent). The authors propose a novel method for learning these unique state-transition processes from observed interactions, with the significant advantage of theoretical support for its effectiveness. This approach is touted as the first to offer such guarantees. The paper validates the method with both synthetic and real-world data, showing its potential in crafting tailored RL policies. This contribution is particularly relevant for developing RL applications that must adapt to individual user characteristics, a common scenario in personalized services."

                "value": "The paper addresses a critical research question in personalized reinforcement learning (RL) by focusing on the identification of latent state-transition processes. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it tackles the complexities of individual differences that are pivotal in RL outcomes but are often not directly observable."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper presents a methodological approach to personalized reinforcement learning, yet there are several areas where clarity and depth are lacking. Specifically, Section 4 would benefit from a citation on methods used to enhance user experience on multimedia platforms, which is currently missing. In Section 3, the description of the reward function \\( R \\) is incomplete; it is essential to clarify its form and relationship with other variables, which is not currently addressed.\n\nRemark 1 appears verbose and could be made more succinct to help readers grasp the core concept more rapidly. Additionally, Section 4's text is overly descriptive and lacks the necessary equations or algorithmic details to clearly understand the proposed processes, such as noise estimation and its application within the model architecture.\n\nThe paper's novelty is also a point of concern; the work appears incremental and relies heavily on established frameworks and methods without offering new insights or innovative approaches. The rationale behind the use of a noise module following discrete encoding is not clear, and the similarity to continuous VAE processes needs to be justified.\n\nOverall, the manuscript would benefit from a thorough polish to enhance readability and flow. The current state may present difficulties for readers in following the progression of ideas and fully understanding the proposed methods."
