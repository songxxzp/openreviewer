An adapt-retrieve-revise framework is proposed to adapt GPT-4 to the domain without modifying its own parameters. The initial step of the framework is to adapt a 7B LLM to the target domain through continual pre-training and the continual pre-trained model will be used to provide a draft answer. The framework will then use the draft answer to retrieve information and then call GPT-4 to revise the answer. The study shows that answer-based evidence retrieval yields much better results than question-based retrieval. The reported results also show that the proposed framework leads to much less hallucination and better recall on a series of tasks in the Chinese law domain."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There are three main concerns about the papers about focus and motivations, soundness of evaluations, and the paper presentations. \n\n**1. Narrow focus of the problem and wider applicability of the proposed method**\n\nWhile improving the reliability of LMs in legal domains, especially more resource-constrained non-English language is important, this work focuses on a single language, and the proposed method heavily relies on the availability of 7B-size LMs in the target language and dozens of billions of domain corpus for continual pre-training. In many languages such rich resources are not available, and as the evaluations are mostly on Chinese legal domain datasets, it is unclear if the proposed method is applicable to other languages or not. If this work only focuses and improves zero-shot performance in Chinese legal domain tasks, it may not be interesting to wider audience of ICLR. \n\n**2. Soundness of evaluations**\n\n- **Evaluation metrics**\n\nIn Section 3.2, the authors mention that their evaluation simply relies on whether the answer includes the ground-truth law clause title is included or not. \n> For tasks LCR, CP, and LegalQA, our metric is the recall of whether the title of the ground-truth law clause is included in the generated answer. This is because, in real-world applications, with the correct title, the contents of the law clause can be easily revised by the rule-based system, indicating that the title is more important than the content.\n\nI don't think it is the proper way to evaluate accuracy or factuality of LM generation to legal domain related questions. For example, although this is an extreme case, if the only one metric is recall, a baseline always generating all clause titles can get perfect score. Using a recall of certain substrings to assess the quality of legal QA questions doesn't seem approppriate. Or if the end goal is to simply find a title of clause titles, I don't think using LM to generate full answers is the most optimal way to achieve such goal, and improving domain adapted retrieval system might be more suitable. \nI checked the LegalQA dataset Github page, and their metrics seem to be MAP, MRR, and P@1, not recall. This makes me wonder why authors decided to use different metrics. \nhttps://github.com/siatnlp/LegalQA\n\n- **Baselines**\nGiven that the evaluation tasks are mostly evaluating whether a model can generate the correct title or a retrieval task, I think authors should include stronger retrieval models (at least multilingual encoder-based retrievals) as part of the pipelines or even as baselines to compare the proposed methods with. While authors claim that GPT-4with retrieval  (Query-based) is not as good as the proposed method, I suspect it is because their retrieval model is E5, which is not competitive compared to more recent embedding-based methods, and is not a multilingual retrieval system and the retrieval quality is poor. For instance, what happens if the authors use mContriever (Izacard et al., 2022) or even conduct continual pre-training of mContriever on the Chinese legal domain corpus used for 7B LM training? \nAlso except for JEC-QA, the evaluations are essentially retrieval tasks, so I wonder how well a competitive retrieval-based method perform on this task (given a question query, retrieves the clause text and title directly). \n\n**3. Technical contributions or novelties of this work**\n\nContinual training for domain adaptations or retrieval-augmentation for domain adaptations have been already studies. While drafting an answer from a small LM to search relevant document sounds somewhat new and interesting, due to the limited focus and evaluation protocol, I am not sure whether this can be widely applicable to other domains or indeed effective to enhance final generation quality. \n\n**4. Presentation**\n\nOccasionally, I found the paper is hard to follow, making it difficult to understand what the true contributions of this work is. Having a better structure might improve the paper presentations. For instance, Section 2 consists of low-level experimental details (the compuational requirements) as well as high-level ideas."
