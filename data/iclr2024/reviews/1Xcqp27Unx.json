            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1:\nDoes this dataset actually evaluate geometric reasoning of LLMs? I think the main weakness with this work is that it is not clear that geometric reasoning is what is being tested. For instance, in the \u201cwith knowledge\u201d setting. The easy and medium questions are getting high 90\u2019s percents with zero-shot prompting. This leads me to believe that for these questions the model does not need to do geometric reasoning and instead can just guess based on semantic matching. This makes sense given that rule #1 and #2 only ensure that the distractors are in the neighborhood and contain a matching relationship type. Looking at some example questions makes this seem like a fairly easy task. \n\nThe hard questions are a bit more challenging and do require a little more reasoning as some constraints will be met by distractors. However, the hard dataset\u2028\u2028W/o relevant knowledge is much harder, but not because it requires more geometric reasoning. It is not clear how well YAGO matches reality. For instance in Table 8 we have knowledge containing \n\n(Dick Powell, is married to, Joan Blondell); \nas well as \n(June Allyson, is married to, Dick Powell);\nAnd one of the constraints is (Dick Powell, is married to, blank 2)\n\nJoan Blondell and Dick Powell divorced in 1944. It would be hard for a LLM which knows that to get the right answer since its knowledge is that Joan Blondell and Dick Powell are not married. (Nevermind the fact that they are also deceased). \n\nThis means that only the w/ knowledge setting is useful. Or maybe w/o knowledge but using retrieval from YAGO. \n\n2: What is the real world use of this evaluation? \nIt is hard to see how this relates to a use case people want to evaluate for. LLMs answer problems in natural language, so that is a use case we want to evaluate. Can LLMs do geometric reasoning to provide answers to user questions? Alternatively, there may be some real-world geometric constraint satisfaction problems that need to be solved and LLMs could be way to do it. \u2028\u2028Here is a list of natural Language phrasings of the constraints from the examples on page 19:\n\nWho acted in True Lies and Chiefs (miniseries)?\n\nWho is married to Idina Menzel and what movie did they act in together?\n\nWho acted in a movie with Andy Garcia and also acted in \u201cScooby Doo! Where\u2019s My Mummy?\u201d\u2028\u2028Who acted in both A little Princess and Harry Potter?\n\nNot really sure how to do this one:\u2028(Dinah Sheridan, acted in, blank 2); (Dinah Sheridan, is married to, blank 1); (blank 1, acted in, blank 2); (Dinah Sheridan, is married to, blank 3); (blank 3, is married to, Jan Sterling).\n\nDina Sheridan is married to what co-star in what movie? Who is Dina Sheridan married to who is also married to Jan Sterling?\n\nWhich co-actor of Paz Vega in a movie directed by Jada Pickett Smith also acted in Prom Night (2008 film)? And what is the movie they co-acted in by Jada Pickett Smith?\n\nThere are some valuable questions here. However, when making a dataset for a language model, effort needs to placed on the language of the questions. Some of these questions don\u2019t make a ton of sense. In addition, answering from 2-3 options is not in line with most use cases where the answer should be generated. \n\n(Note: Part of the issue is that isMarriedTo is in fact time sensitive. If it was \u201cis or was married to\u201d, that would be different.)\n\n3: Why is this not compared to knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) datasets? Existing KGQA datasets test a variety of geometric reasoning abilities in different ways. For instance QALD-10 (and precedents) test the ability to answer questions using a knowledge graph, including questions involving aggregation (counts/sums), comparisons, qualifiers/constraints, and other geometric reasoning patterns. In comparison to those datasets, this seems like more of a constant satisfaction problem than a geometric reasoning one."

                "value": "Open-book and closed-book don\u2019t seem to align with standard definitions. Open-book usually means there is a corpus of documents or knowledge base/graph that can be retrieved from. Maybe that is what is meant here but \u201cneed to solve knowledge crosswords with only their internal parametric knowledge\u201d does not align with that, and is not what is tested. \n\nThe questions themselves could be presented in natural language and it might be less confusing. For instance\nSection e: \u201cWhich co-actor of Paz Vega in a movie directed by Jada Pickett Smith also acted in Prom Night (2008 film)? And what is the movie they co-acted in by Jada Pickett Smith?\u201d\nThis could potentially be done using an LLM with annotator validation?\n\nWhy does an increase in ICT examples not improve performance? It actually does worse on the easy and medium problems? Seems curious? \n\nWhat are the distribution of relationship types in the constraints and in the knowledge context? Seems like a lot of \"acted in\" and \"is married to\" in the examples. \n\nWhy was YAGO chosen? Seems like there are more relations and questions that could be generated using Wikidata. \n\nI think there is value in this direction of research. However, I think in dataset construction, more emphasis needs to be put on \u201cwhy\u201d. Why would someone use this dataset? What are the real world impacts? Alternatively, a dataset could be used to interrogate a model (instead of a benchmark). How are LLMs able to do geometric reasoning? How do they fail? What kinds of geometric reasoning do we care about and what is missed by existing datasets?  Adhering to a more impactful question would lead to more impactful work."
