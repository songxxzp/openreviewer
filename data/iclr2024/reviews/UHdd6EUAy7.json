The proposed Robust-HDP can handle the different noise levels in the uploaded models from different clients and assign the optimal weights to these models. The advantages are:\n\n1.\tRobust-HDP can evaluate the noise level by robust PCA without accessing the privacy requirements of each client, which leads to better privacy protection. The experimental results show that the evaluation method is accurate.\n\n2.\tPrivacy and convergence are guaranteed by the theoretical analysis, while extensive experiments reveal the effectiveness of Robust-HDP.\n\n3.\tThe paper is organized in a logical way, by justifying each design in the methodology with both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation.

Somehow framing the discussion around client memory limitations seems a bit weird.\n\n2) Sec.3.3: \"all the clients are training the same shared model on more or less similar data distributions\".
