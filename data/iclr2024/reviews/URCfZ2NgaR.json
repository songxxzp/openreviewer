The authors address the challenge of modeling variable dependencies across different regimes while maintaining forecasting performance.

This paper omits related work on continual learning in time series and graph domains.\n3. The hyperparameter analysis used in the sensitivity analysis is unclear, which reduces confidence in the experimental results.\n4. There is no comparison of model complexity or training time with other baselines.\n5. This paper can be read as an incremental work that brings the existing graph continual learning problem to the MTS domain. While the authors define the catastrophic forgetting problem in different regime settings in this paper, they overshadow all other similar problems in the time series domain. For example, this paper almost entirely ignores concept/temporal drift, dynamic graph learning, and continual learning on traditional time series. In this paper, it is necessary to clarify the similarities and differences with these fields and show the relative position in these research lines."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The definition of regime written by the authors in the introduction is unclear, so readers may have difficulty understanding it. The motivation to solve problems caused by different regimes is good, but if readers do not understand regimes, the motivation of this paper may be meaningless. Readers may want to look at Figure 1 for simple examples of problems caused by different regimes instead of SKI-CL's framework.\n2. The introduction on page 2 of this paper explains that the catastrophic forgetting problem in the MTS task is \"the model performance will deteriorate over existing regimes as their associated structural knowledge cannot be maintained.\" Compared to the definitions of catastrophic forgetting in other existing domains, this is a setting in which no tasks or classes are added/incremented. Is this description appropriate compared to definitions in other domains?\n3. This paper needs to add related research to papers that solve concept drift and temporal drift, where the distribution changes with time in a time series. In this paper, there is a need to add related research to the paper that addresses concept drift and temporal drift, where distributions change over time in time-series data. The authors also need to compare the models and experiments in these papers.\n4. This paper needs to describe the position in the research of continuous learning, incremental learning, concept/temporal drift, and dynamic graph learning in each domain. Can the authors explain what the similarities and differences are with these research topics?\n5. As written in the last paragraph of Section 2.2, the authors are aware that FSNet [1] uses MTS data, but do not consider it in the baseline due to the online learning setting. However, the experimental baseline of FSNet also performs including **DER++** and **ER**. This appears to be possible in the experimental settings of this paper, and comparative experiments are needed. If you can compare FSNet, compare the performance difference compared to the model proposed by the author.\n6. Additionally, the paper makes no mention of the MIR [2] method. This should be considered similarly to FSNet above.\n7. The authors need to mention that papers [3-5] dealing with temporal drift are either experimental baselines or related work.\n8. Can you explain how the dependency structure learning proposed by the author differs from the graph structure parameterization in the GTS paper [6]? If there is a similarity, it is necessary to cite the GTS paper.\n9. Section 4.4 of the paper explains as follows: \u201cWe perform experiments on the Traffic-CL dataset to validate the effectiveness and sensitivity of two key hyperparameters in SKI-CL, the weight of structure regularizer $\\lambda$ (1 by default) and the memory budget (sampling ratio) at each regime (0.01 by default).\u201d However, the results for $\\lambda$ of 1 are not shown in Table 3. And the results in Table 3 and Table 4 do not show any settings that match the results in Table 2, so the reliability of the experimental results is reduced.\n10. From the experimental results in Table 2, the AF of SKI-CL of the proposed model does not result in the lowest error compared to all baselines. For example, $\\text{Autoformer}_{\\text{der++}}$ has the lowest MAE for AF in Traffic-CL. There seems to be a lack of explanation as to why other baselines have lower errors.\n11. There is a grammatical error in the sentence \"given the a collection\" above Eq.(1) on page 5.\n\n\n> [1]: Learning Fast and Slow for Online Time Series Forecasting, ICLR 2023\n> [2]: Online continual learning with maximal interfered retrieval, NeurIPS 2019\n> [3]: AdaRNN: Adaptive learning and forecasting of time series, CIKM 2021\n> [4]: Reversible Instance Normalization for Accurate Time-Series Forecasting against Distribution Shift, ICLR 2022\n> [5]: Time Series Forecasting with Hypernetworks Generating Parameters in Advance, arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.12034, 2022\n> [6]: Discrete Graph Structure Learning for Forecasting Multiple Time Series, ICLR, 2021"
