                "value": "This paper attempts to create a mathematical model for a simplified version of \"knowledge transfer\" from a teacher to a student within the context of multi-class learning. Notably, the authors make two key assumptions: that both 1) $\\mathcal{S}$ (representing the space of all possible queries a student can pose to a teacher) and 2) $\\mathcal{A}$ (denoting the space of all possible answers provided by the teacher) are finite.\n\nIn mathematical terms, for each query $s\\in\\mathcal{S}$, let $\\pi^*(\\cdot\\vert s)$ represent the (optimal) teacher policy, or the conditional distribution of labels for the query $s$. The student's goal is to learn $\\hat{\\pi}$, a finite distribution with the same complexity as $\\pi^*$, using only $n$ i.i.d. queries (and answers) from the teacher, represented by the set $\\\\{(a_i,s_i)\\\\}$ for $i\\in[n]$.\n\nIn this context, the authors aim to establish minimax bounds for $\\mathbb{E}_{s\\sim\\rho}\\left[\\mathsf{TV}\\left(\\hat{\\pi},\\pi^*\\vert\\rho\\right)\\right]$, which measures the \"$\\rho$-expected total variation distance\" between the teacher and student's policies. Here, $\\rho$ signifies the distribution that generates queries across $\\mathcal{S}$. The paper successfully derives minimax rates for this problem under three different scenarios: i) when only hard labels are provided, ii) in cases where, in addition to labels, the probability of the label from $\\pi^*$ is also given, and iii) when all class probabilities are given for each query.\n\nThe paper is well-written, and it meticulously references pertinent prior research (as far as I can tell). The mathematical derivations appear sound, with no conspicuous errors. Moreover, there are several experiments, though I haven't examined them closely. Overall, this is a commendable theoretical contribution. However, I believe that the assumption of finiteness for both the \"query\" and \"answer\" spaces oversimplifies the problem, leading to bounds that might not be as intriguing as one might hope (please refer to the weaknesses section for further clarification).\n\nMy vote is a weak accept."

I scrutinized some of the proofs and did not find any significant errors. Furthermore, the other results seem mathematically sound.\n\n- The problem is analyzed under three distinct regimes, with the gradual introduction of additional side information to the original dataset. This approach allows the reader to observe, in a step-by-step manner, the mathematical impact of incorporating each layer of side information.\n\n- The paper also includes some experimental validations, although I did not review them in detail."

                "value": "I suppose that the assumptions regarding the finiteness of both $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$ may have oversimplified the problem. Here is my interpretation of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 (please correct me if I am mistaken):\n\n- In essence, the paper aims to \"learn\" a distribution of dimension ($|\\mathcal{S}|\\times|\\mathcal{A}|$), denoted as $\\rho\\times\\pi^*$. By \"learn,\" I mean the process of minimizing a specific expected total variation (TV) distance, as mentioned earlier. Let me introduce the notation $F = |\\mathcal{S}|\\times|\\mathcal{A|}$. It is already established that having approximately $\\tilde{O}(F)$ (where $\\tilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors) samples, denoted as $n$, is sufficient to capture almost all the probability mass within $\\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A}$ according to the distributions $\\rho$ and $\\pi^*$. This can be directly derived from the coupon collector theorem. Consequently, in the worst-case scenario where both $\\rho$ and $\\pi^*$ are not sparse, we typically have, on average, $\\tilde{O}(n/F)$ samples for each query-answer pair $(a, s)$. Consequently, the overall distribution $\\rho \\times \\pi^*$, as well as any of its derivatives (such as the aforementioned \"expected TV distance,\" which is the primary focus of this paper), can be approximated with an error of at most $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{F/n})$, as a direct consequence of general inequalities like Hoeffding. In my opinion, this summarizes most of Theorem 3.1 and 3.2. However, the rigorious derivation of final formulations, which has been done in this paper, is still a nice addition to MLT community.\n\n- The bounds pertaining to other scenarios discussed in the paper can also be derived using mathematical methods similar to the ones mentioned above.\n\nNonetheless, I commend the authors for their precise determination of minimax rates and their detailed analysis of individual cases. It would, however, be more intriguing if the paper explored more intricate scenarios for $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$. For example, one would naturally expect other (and more interesting) notions of complexity (such as VC-dimension, etc.) of distribution families $\\rho$ and $\\pi^*$ to show up in bounds, instead of the mere cardinality of query-answer spaces."
