It particularly extends the work RepSurf for synthetic point clouds to the case of LiDAR point clouds. To tackle the challenge of sparse, uneven, and large-scale LiDAR point clouds, the authors use a point sliding module to jitter the centroid of the triangle. An additional strategy is to gradually downsample the point clouds and extract the features for aggregation. This work demonstrates its performance in point cloud segmentation and shows some advantages."

Can it be generalized to other types of point cloud problems, for instance, low-level point cloud processing problems, e.g., denoising, upsampling, etc.?\n\n2. A follow-up question is, since this method works well for sparse LiDAR point clouds, can it be applied back to the simpler case which is the dense point clouds or synthetic point clouds? Will the performance also be improved?\n\n3. The Point Sliding Module generates some jittering to the centroid for augmentation. This process has certain randomness because the coefficients are drawn from uniform or Gaussian distribution. I wonder how stable this method would be in the end, because there is a certain randomness in the process.\n\n4. The authors use downsampling with FPS to obtain the RealSurf feature. However, this is also performed in PointNet++. Thus it would be better if the authors could further clarify the way they do the downsampling differs from that is proposed in PointNet++.\n\n5. How this this work compare to other types of advanced feature extractors? For example, those based on transformer modules, e.g., Point transformer and Voxel transformer.\n\n6. How is the computational complexity of this proposal compared to PointNet++ and other competing methods?"

It might be beneficial for readers if the motivation behind the paper were more prominently emphasized. Upon careful reading, I found it a bit subtle to identify the core motivation. Was it primarily about the 'point sliding module'? If so, the contribution of the article appears to be somewhat incremental. I hope the authors can highlight their contributions. \n4. The experimental results are good, but the comparison might not seem very fair. If I'm not mistaken, the entire framework is just PointNet++ with the addition of tangent plane information to its input. Why is there such a significant improvement compared to PointNet++ as shown in Table 1 or Table 2? Does the comparison in Table 1 or 2 involve an unfair comparison? How would it fare against other methods if various tricks were also applied? In Table 2, compared to the previous PointNet++, there's an improvement of 50 points. It seems that some of the latest tricks were used. It's hard to believe that there would be such a significant improvement by just adding some extra information. If there are any unfair comparisons, it would be better to unify some settings for a fair comparison and demonstrate it on top-performing (SOTA) methods. After all, the method introduced in the paper is framework-agnostic and is a general method for point clouds."

Point Sliding is a data augmentation method that jitters the points so as to make the proposed method more robust to noises. In the ablation study (Figure 7), the authors show 0.5 performs best with Guassian noise on SemanticKITTI. I am wondering, is this hyper parameter consistent across different benchmarks?\n5.
