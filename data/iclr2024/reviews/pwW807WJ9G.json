Although the authors derive PAC-Bayesian bound for GNNs in the transductive setting and show how the interplay between training and testing sets influences the generalization ability, I fail to see the strong connection between the theoretical analysis and the proposed method. The proposed method seems to simply adopt the idea of the self-attention mechanism from the transformer and apply it to the graph. It's not clear to me how the proposed method enhances the generalization for the distant nodes.\n\n2. My major concern about the proposed method is the graph partition as partitioning the graph usually leads to information loss. Though node2vec is used for positional encoding purposes, it only encodes the local topological structure, and it cannot compensate for the lost information between different subgraphs. Based on algorithm 1 in Appendix E, there is no information exchange between different subgraphs. The nodes in a subgraph can only receive the information from other nodes within this subgraph and these nodes are isolated from the nodes from other subgraphs. The performance seems to highly depend on the quality of the graph partition algorithms. However, it's unclear whether different graph partitions will influence the performance of the proposed method or not.\n\n3. Some experimental setups are not quite clear. See questions below."

However, in real-world applications, including the experiments of this paper, both nodes features and their labels are fixed, and the randomness come from the random partition of training and test nodes [2,3,4]. Therefore, I think that the authors should use the results in literatures [5,6], e.g., Corollary 7 in [6] to derive similar results as Lemma 1. This can be done by incorporating the techniques in works [7,8]. Otherwise, the authors should conduct some synthetic experiments that treating labels as random variables to verify their theoretical results.\n- The authors claim that the proposed module is plug-and-play, which means that it can be applied on any GNNs. However, they only equip GCN with this module.

                "value": "This paper aims to propose a theory to derive a PAC-Bayesian bound for message-passing GNN in the transductive node classification and interpret the structure imbalance phenomenon. Based on the theory, authors propose the InterpGNN-GW to enhance the interplay between distant and intra-batch nodes via an attention-based global workspace mechanism."

                "value": "1. The derived bound in this paper shows that more information interaction between test and training nodes can lead to smaller generalization errors and interpret the structural imbalance phenomenon.\n2. To address the problem, the authors proposed a new method called InterpGNN-GW which leverages the attention mechanism to global workspace.\n3. Sufficient experiments on different graph datasets have been conducted. The proposed InterpGNN-GW outperforms many baseline methods both on small-scale graphs and large-scale graphs.\n4. The paper presentation is good and the organization is clear and easy to follow."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. In the \u2018Theorem 1 interpret the structure imbalance phenomenon.\u2019 part, authors claim that stronger interplay with training nodes brings small generalization error, and nodes with smaller degrees engage in fewer interactions with training nodes thus having the trend in Fig2. However, it seems like a mistake according to the authors' theory. Nodes with smaller degrees engage in fewer interactions with training nodes should have bigger generalization error, while in fig2 nodes with fewer degrees have better performance.\n2. The Experiment part mainly concentrates on node classification performance and ablation study. It would be better to design experiments to show how InterpGNN-GW increases the interplay between training and test nodes, which also strengthens the claims in theory and interprets the structure imbalance phenomenon.\n3. Lack the motivation to concatenate positional encoding. Authors may add motivation such as position embedding containing the interplay with training and test nodes.\n4. It would be more convincing if authors could provide full ablation study results on all datasets instead of separating ablated models to Tab 5 and Fig 6 and using different datasets.\n5. Can InterpGNN-GW be used in a non-rigorous inductive setting? If yes, what about performance? For example, train InterpGNN-GW on the training nodes and broadcast the workspace to test nodes with test nodes still unseen to the training process. It should be similar to interplaying among out-of-batch nodes mentioned in the intuition part.\n6. Why does InterpGNN-GW fail to outperform some baselines on CoraFull, any in-depth or intuitive analysis?"
