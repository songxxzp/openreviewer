This paper considers one of its relaxed versions: solving a matrix $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}}$ such that $|| \\mathbf{W} \\circ (\\mathbf{A} - \\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}}) ||_F \\le \\kappa \\cdot \\min _{\\mathrm{rank}(\\mathbf{A}')\\le k} ||\\mathbf{W} \\circ (\\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{A}')||$, which assumes $\\mathrm{rank}(\\mathbf{W}) = r$ and removes the rank bound for matrix $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}}$.   \nFor the above problem, this paper proposes a simple algorithm and proves its correctness. As a corollary, this paper obtains the first relative error guarantee for unsupervised feature selection with a weighted $F$-norm objective.

They provide approximation guarantees for the algorithm as well as a supposedly more practical variant of the algorithm, Algorithm 2, which is meant to avoid a computational pitfall of the original method. Furthermore, they provide an analysis of the resulting communication complexity, and relate that to a lower bound. Finally, they conduct numerical simulations comparing the algorithm's performance on model compression datasets with other state-of-the-art weighted low-rank approximation algorithms.

With the practical variant of Algorithm 2, only the storage issue of the resulting approximation is mitigated, but not not the fact that W^{\\circ -1} needs to be computed in a dense manner, which requires O(nd) of storage in intermediate calculations.\nWhile the communication complexity discussion of Section 1.1.2 is interesting, it is unclear whether and how the algorithm can be implemented efficiently in a distributed manner. While the authors claim that their result is the first about communication complexity for weighted low-rank approximation problems, it seems that communication complexity for such results was already previously discussed, e.g., in Musco, Cameron, Christopher Musco, and David Woodruff. \"Simple Heuristics Yield Provable Algorithms for Masked Low-Rank Approximation.\"\u00a0_Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference (ITCS 2021)_. 2021."
