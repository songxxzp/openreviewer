However, these contributions may not meet the high standard of ICLR, as both self-distillation and smoothness-oriented losses (e.g., FL) have been widely discussed in uncertainty estimation / calibration, while the authors have not made significant theoretical breakthroughs nor significantly better empirical results in the current shape of submission. \n\nThere is unfortunately a lack of clarity in the very core arguments: Sec 3.2: \u201cThe loss formulation is inspired by the intuition that as training goes, a model\u2019s prediction becomes refined, and thus the predicted confidence scores can be gradually combined with the ground truth, to form a smoothed target distribution which has an increased entropy compared to the one-hot encoded hard targets, potentially leading to a better calibrated model.\u201d This should be the most important argument supporting the manuscript, but what does this mean? Can the authors please make breaks to improve the clarity?  \n\nAfter Eq. 3: \u201cAdditionally, in multiclass calibration, we care about preserving the class relations. Pearson correlation-based loss function allows the model to be guided appropriately to distill those truly informative multiclass relations.\u201d What does \u201cclass relation\u201d here mean? The argument of this paragraph is not intuitive. Instead, for multi-class scenarios, KL divergence is also computed for multiple classes as well. \n\nAdding smoothness constraints often comes at the cost of losing sharpness, therefore hurting categorical accuracy: the authors are therefore encouraged to report acc for the upper part of Table 2. Even looking at the lower half of Table 2, the proposed approach sometimes loses sharpness compared with NLL + MbLS. Also, what does NLL/FL in the lower part of Table 2 mean? Are they from NLL or FL or from a linear combination of them?   \n\nDespite special considerations for multi-class tasks, when checking SCE (measuring multi-class calibration) and Acc, it is difficult to see if the proposed approach yields better multi-class results than NLL + MbLS \n\nGiven that knowledge distillation, including this work, has been widely applied for label smoothing, the authors are encouraged to discuss at least the following similar works, and make comparisons if they find it necessary: [2-4] \n\n[1] ACLS: Adaptive and Conditional Label Smoothing for Network Calibration \n[2] Self-Distribution Distillation: Efficient Uncertainty Estimation \n[3] Efficient Uncertainty Estimation in Semantic Segmentation via Distillation \n[4] Distilling Calibrated Student from an Uncalibrated Teacher"

The authors are encouraged to highlight this in the manuscript.\n\nGiven that ECE can be easily abused by degenerative solutions, the authors are encouraged to also report Brier scores which are proper functions for measuring calibration. \n\nSensitivity on $\\alpha$'s should be moved to the main text: this would be a common question raised by most readers."
