Notably, this shift is not trivial, e.g., if feature $X_c$ is the cause of label $y$ but due to noises, $X_s$ has higher correlation with $y$ during training but not in testing, then the method may fail. In such a case, $X_s$ is a more prominent component during training, thus, it will be extracted by SVD decompositions and mislead model training including the contrastive training.\n2. I did not find the OOD generalization theoretical guarantees and the required assumptions. According to my understanding, it is impossible to solve OOD generalization problem using purely observational data without any interventional equivalent information or assumptions. Can the authors clarify what are the assumptions and the guarantees?\n3. The method may not be well motivated. I don't see why the authors choose a graph to model the sample correlations."

                "value": "1. The major concern for me on this work is the potential overclaim. The paper title describes the method as a \"graph-theoretic framework\", but instead, the method is purely based on some heuristic ways for constructing a graph from the data. Also, the theoretical analysis has weak connection with graph theory, and is based on linear algebra. Furthermore, the existing experiments fail to show how the method can act as a general \"framework\" where different models can be applied. From my personal view, I would recognize the method as a graph-based model instead of a \"graph-theoretic framework\".\n\n2. The second concern is the limited evaluation in comparison with the broad claim in the title and introduction. For out-of-distribution generalization, there are diverse kinds of distirbution shifts in data, and the current work only studies one particular type, covariate shift. It limits the scope of this paper against the claim of \"unifying out-of-distribution generalization and detection\". Also, the selection for baselines is not that convincing. The baselines for out-of-distribution generalization tasks are published several years ago, and there are plenty of SOTA models that are missing. For OOD detection, the scores appeared in the paper are different from those reported in the paper of baselines. Is this due to that the authors use different protocols?\n\n3. Some of the descriptions are misleading. E.g., the self-supervised graph adjacency and supervised graph adjacency. Also the section tiltle for 3.1 \"Graph-theoretic formulation\" is misguided. What does the graph theory refer to and how is the problem of OOD learning formulated as a graph problem?"

This loss function serves as a key component of the framework, contributing to the overall effectiveness of the method.\n\nMoreover, the paper substantiates its claims through a series of well-conducted experiments that illustrate the capabilities of the framework in the context of OOD generalization and detection.

It is worth noting that the paper claims that the closed-form solution for the representation is equivalent to conducting spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix.\n\nFurthermore, the experimental results, conducted on various datasets, showcase the impressive performance of the Spectral Learning with Wild data (SLW) framework. The evidence provided through these experiments underscores the framework's competitiveness and potential to make significant contributions to the field of OOD generalization and detection.\n\nThe paper's combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation, along with its innovative approach, suggests that it has the potential to bring valuable advancements to the understanding and application of spectral decomposition in addressing OOD challenges.
