The paper's motivation is clear, and the impact of such work is immediately evident. \n4. The extensions are strong and of good breadth. This framework is evidently useful for providing guarantees under different risk settings, not just the initial canonical setting of risk presented first. \n\nOverall, I vote for acceptance of this paper. I have several questions on computability and the writing, but these can be fixed and explained for the camera-ready version."

                "value": "1. Some motivating examples of cases where such conformal risk control would be desirable over the traditional coverage guarantee. One can think of cases where F1-score is more appropriate to measure than coverage. It would be great to mention these examples in the introduction so that the reader understands more the motivation of this generalization. \n2. Why is a bounded loss function reasonable? What examples of loss functions violate this or satisfy this? Obviously, a coverage guarantee satisfies this, but what other metrics satisfy this? \n3. The $\\Lambda$ operator is quite confusing. You do not explicitly define it and still say $L_i$ is a map from $\\Lambda$ to another set. You should have defined $\\Lambda$ before. You also say $\\sup \\Lambda \\in \\Lambda$. Is $\\Lambda$ the set of possible $\\lambda$, so the set of real numbers?\n4. In the buildup of section 1.1, I find the intuitive explanation of the method and why it works lacking. I believe a strong reason of why conformal prediction is so popular is its intuitiveness. I find these definitions unintuitive and the provided explanation lacking. I would spend more time describing the intuition of the constants and claims defined. \n5. One of my main concerns is the computability of $\\hat{\\lambda}$. This seems highly nontrivial to calculate. This seems like the most important point of the paper. Could you describe how to compute this? Moreover, does this formalization make it easier to compute than other similar methods doing conformal risk control? \n6. Does the guarantee of $\\alpha -\\frac{2B}{n+1}$ in Section 1.1 match that of conformal prediction? In that case, the known guarantee is $\\geq \\alpha$, which is loose by $\\frac{2}{n+1}$. Does this method recover the tightest guarantees of Split Conformal Predictions when the loss function is set to be miscoverage?\n7. In the related works section, I find the differences between existing and current work confusing. You mention the guarantee in this paper is in expectation. Why is this better than existing works? Do existing works do worst-case analysis or high probability analysis? The technical similarity between different methods is not a sufficient difference in my opinion. In the second paragraph, I miss what the existing conformal risk works do. Is it possible that existing conformal risk works do not directly generalize conformal predictions or are often less tight? I believe more details on the differences between existing conformal risk papers and this paper are needed. \n8. I find the theoretical section again void of any intuition presented. I would highly encourage the authors to provide more intuition on the proof as to the meaning of each step in section 2.1. I found it very difficult to parse. Moreover, the notation in the proof of Theorem 1 is difficult to read. I believe a little cleaning up of this proof would be helpful. An example is that using $\\hat{\\lambda}'$ and $\\hat{\\lambda}$ are poor notation choices and create a lack of clarity. \n9. The assumption in Theorem 2, i.e. $\\mathbb{P}(J(L_i, \\lambda) > 0) = 0$ is provided without sufficient explanation. What set of loss functions satisfies such a definition and why? Which loss functions do not satisfy this assumption? Providing this analysis will help give intuition as to what Theorem 2 shows and when it works."

A relatively significant point is that, while theoretical bounds here are given in expectation, as compared to existing PAC-type guarantees on general risks developed in other recent related papers, but in practice it would still make a lot of sense to establish good empirical performance of conformal risk prediction relative to those --- and in particular, to Learn-then-Test, which appears both very tractable just as the proposed framework here, but also handles arbitrary losses, not just ones that are monotonic, and thus seems to offer better flexibility in practical settings (without having to resort to discussions of near-monotonicity like the present manuscript does). Since the displayed metrics about the conformal risk control method are agnostic to whether in-expectation or PAC-style guarantees are given, it should be easy to make this comparison quite direct, from a practical standpoint.\n\n2. As a very minor point, the experiment on F1 score control in open-domain question answering, in contrast to other experiments in this paper, seems less useful and set up in a somewhat stylized way that doesn't seem to aim to capture any of the linguistic difficulties in tackling open domain question-answering --- which makes the plotted performance graph seem not very interesting. The F1 score is computed over a rather simplistic bag-of-tokens similarity between predictions and answers, and is not justified by the authors as the risk measure of choice here; moreover, a shift to alpha = 0.3 happens with the scant explanation that this is the best empirical choice such that almost all answers are typically correct. Recognizing that this is just a toy example to support the validity of the proposed method, I would still have liked to see a somewhat deeper discussion of what monotonic risks one could/should use when dealing with natural language; this would be very useful in the context of recent developments in LLMs."

This seems similar to [1], where the index refers to a specific value of $\\lambda$.\n- Can $R(\\lambda)$ be interpreted as a parameterized conformity score and $\\lambda$ as the quantile of the corresponding empirical distribution?\n- [1] addresses the case of non-monotonic risks. How is this compatible with Proposition 2?\n- Does the method apply to the outputs of a regression model?\n- Are the extensions of Section 4 straightforward consequences of Theorem 1 and existing CP theory? \n\n[1]\n\"Learn then Test: Calibrating predictive algorithms to achieve risk control\"."
