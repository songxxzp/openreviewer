For example:\n        - \"previous SHGL methods generally overlook or cannot effectively utilize the heterogeneity.\" Many existing SHGL methods, such as metapath2vec, can capture the heterogeneity. All those GNN-based SHGL methods can also capture both aspects as long as they employ heterogeneous GNN models.\n        - \"metapaths are employed to capture the homogeneity in the heterogeneous graph.\" Actually, many SHGL methods also leverage metapaths to capture the heterogeneity, such as metapath2vec, which applies DeepWalk to the node sequences (containing multiple types of nodes) generated by the pre-defined metapath.\n    2. Unclear benefit of mining heterogeneity. The example given in the introduction section is hard to understand.\n    4.

Is it to train a linear classifier (e.g., SVM) on top of (frozen) representations learnt by self-supervised methods?\n2. Metapaths can also associate two nodes with different node types. The definition of metapaths given on page 3 is therefore misleading. It's just many GNN-based methods tend to use the same-type version to construct homogeneous graphs.\n3. The idea of this paper is kind of similar to DHGCN [1], which also explicitly and separately aggregates heterogeneous neighbors (heterogeneity) and metapath-guided same-type neighbors (homogeneity).\n4. Definition 2.1 is currently hard to understand. The sentence \"if the conditions ... hold\" may need to be changed to \"if $|c_{ik}-c_{jk}|\\rightarrow 0$ ($\\forall 1 \\leq k \\leq F^\\prime$) hold for every $v_i, v_j$ satisfying $v_i \\rightarrow v_j$ (i.e., $||x_i-x_j||_2 \\rightarrow 0$)\"\n5. It would be better to also visualize the self-expressive matrix, to show that it indeed captures homogeneity/homophily.\n\n[1] Saurav Manchanda, Da Zheng, George Karypis: Schema-Aware Deep Graph Convolutional Networks for Heterogeneous Graphs.

                "value": "This paper addresses challenges in self-supervised heterogeneous graph learning. It points out two main issues: reliance on human-defined meta-paths, and underutilization of graph heterogeneity. To tackle these, the authors propose a method that captures homogeneity without predefined meta-paths using a self-expressive matrix. Additionally, they capture heterogeneity by aggregating information from different node types. Two losses are introduced to ensure consistency between homogeneity and heterogeneity and to preserve task-related information. Theoretical analysis suggests the learned representations effectively capture homogeneity and introduce more task-related information. Experimental results demonstrate the method's superiority across various downstream tasks."

They theoretically analyze that the learned homogeneous representations exhibit the grouping effect to capture the homogeneity, and considering both homogeneity and heterogeneity introduces more task-related information\n\nS3. The use of a self-expressive matrix to capture homogeneity without predefined meta-paths is a creative solution, potentially reducing the need for expert knowledge. The introduction of consistency and specificity loss functions enhances the model's ability to extract and preserve task-related information.\n\nS4.  Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method across various downstream tasks, validating its practical utility. The paper evaluates the proposed method thoroughly on different downstream tasks, showcasing its versatility and robust performance."

Complexity and Computational Cost: The paper doesn't extensively discuss the computational complexity and resource requirements of the proposed method, leaving potential concerns about its scalability in large-scale applications, especially the comparison with traditional meta-path-based approaches.\n\nW2. The whole workflow is a little complicated, which may raise concerns about reproducibility. \n\nW3. Some important work missing, the author should discuss them in their paper, including but not limited to Self-supervised Hypergraph Representation Learning for Sociological Analysis. TKDE; Heterogeneous Hypergraph Embedding for Graph Classification. WSDM\n\n\n\nQ1: For section 2.1 (homogeneity), I wonder what the compared results between a message-passing GNN via such a complex self-expressive matrix and the one via graph transformer (learnable self-attention)\n\n\nQ2: I wonder about the scalability and efficiency of real-world datasets.\n\n\nQ3: It seems the whole workflow for node classification is not an end-to-end pipeline, the author first uses their framework to pre-train the model and then they use the learned model for specific node classification. I wonder what's the detailed settings for their task head for the node classification task.\n\n\nQ4. Interpretability: Although the traditional meta-path approach may have some shortcomings as mentioned by the authors,  there is no doubt that these methods are very intuitive for human understanding and explanation. I wonder how the interpretability of the learned representations is. Can the authors provide more insights into how the model's representations can be interpreted, aiding researchers and practitioners in understanding its decision-making process?"
