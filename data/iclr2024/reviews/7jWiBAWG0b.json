            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "First, the model setup is a bit misleading. In the title and abstract, the authors call the setting heavy tails and heavy-tailed. However, what the authors really study is the sub-Weibull tails (Definition 3.6) that excludes polynomial decays as contrast to many papers the authors cited in the paper. Although there is no unique definition of heavy-tailedness, many readers would assume that you are talking about polynomial decay noise while you actually did not. I suggest you at least mention in the abstract that you are working with sub-Weibull tails. \n\nSecond, the technical novelty and the necessity of working with sub-Weibull distributed gradient noise is not very convincing to me. The reason is that I understand that sub-Weibull type distribution can appear in the concentration type inequalities if you want to obtain some high probability guarantees. But this is not what the authors are doing in this paper. The authors simply use very standard $L^2$ type arguments to study the SGD. What I meant by that is that if you look carefully at the proofs in the appendix, the authors only need some assumption to bound the 2nd moment, instead of relying on the full definition of the sub-Weibull distribution as is described in Definition 3.6. That means all the existing proof techniques in SGD for finite variance setups can all be directly used in the paper. If all you need is an application of Lemma C.3. with $p=2$, i.e. a second-moment estimate, why don\u2019t you simply assume that instead of your Definition 3.6. in your paper? Will all the results still go through? Essentially, Lemma C.3. with $p=2$ says that if the second-moment depends on the parameter $\\theta$ in a certain way (where $\\theta$ measures the heaviness of the tail), then it will also appear in the final results. In my view, the authors are not using the full information of sub-Weibull distribution, and there are numerous papers in the literature about SGD with finite variance, and hence to include heavy tails in the title and abstract and use that as a selling point is a bit misleading. \n\nThird, maybe I didn\u2019t read the paper carefully enough, but it is not clear to me whether the same setting has been studied for pointwise SGD. If the answer is yes, then the authors should highlight the technical novelty and difficulty to extend the results to pairwise setting, which to me does not seem to be very difficult. Moreover, the authors should compare the results with the pointwise setting. On the other hand, if the answer is no, then I am wondering why the authors do not study the pointwise setting, which is much more common and popular in the literature, and the authors should comment on whether similar results can hold for pointwise SGD."

            "questions": {
                "value": "For the main results, it would be better if the authors can provide some discussions on the monotonic (or not) dependence of the bound on $\\theta$, which measures the heaviness of the tail, and provide some insights.  \n\nOn page 2, before you talk about developing previous analysis techniques to the heavy-tailed pairwise cases, you should also cite some works about algorithmic stability and generalization bounds for pointwise SGD with heavy tails from the literature. \n\nOn page 3, you wrote that it is demonstrated in Nguyen et al. (2019); Hodgkinson and Mahoney (2021) that the generalization ability of SGD may suffer from the heavy-tailed gradient noise. However, I recently came across two more recent papers Raj et al. (2023) \u201cAlgorithmic stability of heavy-tailed stochastic gradient descent on least squares\u201d and Raj et al. (2023) \u201cAlgorithmic stability of heavy-tailed SGD with general loss functions\u201d that seem to argue heavy tails of gradient noise can help with generalization. I suggest you add more citations and discussions.\n\nAssuming the gradient of loss function being Lipschitz is very reasonable. But assuming the gradient and the loss function itself are both Lipschitz seems to be quite strong. It would be nice if you can add some examples and discussions about your Assumption 3.7.\n\nIn Assumption 3.8. and Assumption 3.9., it would be better for you to add a line or two to explain what the expectations are taken with respect to."

A similar relationship is derived for the SGD under the assumption of heavy tailed gradient noise (without bounded gradient assumption). Next, bounds on the  $\\ell_1$ on- average stability are derived for pairwise SGD under the aforementioned assumptions, which lead to explicit bounds on the generalization error.  Furthermore, bounds on generalization error and excess risk are derived for pairwise SGD under the PL condition, and assuming heavy-tailed gradient noise.
