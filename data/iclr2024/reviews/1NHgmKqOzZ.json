                "value": "The significant contribution of this work lies in the introduction of Progressive Dataset Distillation (PDD). It is a novel methodology in the field of dataset distillation. PDD effectively addresses the limitations inherent in existing DD works by recognizing that relying solely on a single synthetic subset for distillation does not lead to optimal generalization. \n\nSpecifically, PDD innovatively synthesizes multiple small sets of synthetic images, with each set being conditioned on the knowledge acquired from the preceding sets. The alteranated updated model is then trained on the cumulative union of these subsets. This sophisticated approach results in a noteworthy performance improvement."

As far as my knowledge extends, this is the first instance where the synthesis of multiple small sets of distilled images has been proposed. The authors have adeptly addressed the challenge of minimizing bias and ensuring training stability by introducing a conditioning mechanism for each distilled set, based on the knowledge accumulated from the preceding sets.\n\n2. The clarity and coherence of the writing are commendable. The motivation behind the research is robust, and the overall structure of the paper is meticulously organized.\n\n3. The experimental results provided in the paper are highly promising and effectively illustrate the efficacy of the proposed solution."

After Eq.4, the authors claim PDD can be used to **any** dataset distillation method. Therefore, it is necessary to do experiment if the PDD can augment DREAM.\n3. The accuracy is not as good as DREAM. For example, on CIFAR-10 IPC-10, DREAM can achieve 69.4% accuracy. But the proposed PDD can just achieve 67.9%. On CIFAR-100 IPC-10, DREAM can achieve 46.8% accuracy. But the proposed PDD can just achieve 45.8%. \n4. Based on question 3, why does the proposed method have bad performance on IPC-10?\n5. The idea is too straightforward. Is it possible to update the previous frozen subset with small learning rate?\n\n\n I will increase the score if the DREAM-related experiments are added.\n\n[a] DREAM: Efficient Dataset Distillation by Representative Matching, ICCV 2023"

How do the results come in detail, like what's the IPC of each stage, and how to conduct multi-stage training? Although some of these questions are answered in the following parts, the writing is not coherent.\n    * The networks for the next stage come from the training results with previous batches of synthetic data. In IDC, the networks are periodically re-initialized randomly. In MTT, the networks come from checkpoints of training with original datasets. We have to conduct some modifications to these baselines before using PDD. These operations are unclear.\n2. A comment: this method makes an assumption on downstream training using synthetic datasets: models must be trained in a multi-stage way using the provided multi-stage synthetic data, which would introduce a lot of hyperparameters, especially in the cross-architecture setting and make the dataset distillation less elegant. Given that the performance gain is not significant in most cases, the practical value of the proposed method is somewhat limited.\n3. Through the results in Tab. 6, the effect of discarding easy-to-learn examples at later stages is not significant. More evidence is necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness."
