                "value": "1. Oracle assumed is too strong and impractical. The oracle solves a very hard computational problem even in the classical setting, especially in the low temperature regime. The setting in this work is the quantum analogue of learning classical graphical models given an oracle that can always return the sufficient statistics given the energy function of a model. \n\nThe main technical challenge that needs to be addressed in this field is the fact that there are no quantum versions of the pseudo-likelihood type methods that are used to learn classical Gibbs states. The existence of these methods in the quantum regime would bypass the need for these types of oracles. A very recent work (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02243) has shown that the computational complexity of solving this problem is polynomial in the size of the system, without assuming any strong oracles. This new method has much worse sample complexity, so a practical algorithm is still out of reach.\n\nIn general oracles are useful to establish relative complexity of two tasks, inference and learning in this case. But for learning Gibbs states, from classical results, we already know that inference is much harder than learning. So the bounds established in this work are only marginally interesting.\n\n2. It is mostly using established techniques in optimization to solve a standard problem of matching sufficient statistics (essentially Maximum Likelihood).  Novelty of this work mainly comes from the techniques used to establish the bounds on Hessian.  The methods used to solve the problem it self are not new.\n\n3. Overall the method is not very efficient. Theory gives an exponential worst case run-time (which is absorbed into the oracle) and the field of quantum computing is too nascent to provide any high quality data  to establish any practical claims regarding the algorithm. \n\nOverall I don't think this work has made any good breakthroughs in solving this problem and is not a good fit for ICLR. The new  Quantum BP method is interesting and might be a good research direction."
