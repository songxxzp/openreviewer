This exposes it to the diversity needed to handle new datasets and prediction tasks.\n\n\u2022\tNovel prompt engineering strategies are used to transform tabular data into natural language inputs consumable by the LLM.

It achieves higher accuracy than the best neural baselines and boosting methods across the aggregated test sets.\n\nIn summary, UniPredict demonstrates how scaling up training data and prompt engineering enables LLMs to learn universal tabular prediction capabilities not seen in prior specialized models.

This omission of key information is a major limitation. Based on the logo in Figure 2, I infer that OpenAI's fine-tuning API was likely used. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the models in the experiments (e.g. UniPredict-light and UniPredict-heavy) were potentially GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.\n\n2.\tThe previous point raises the concern that the paper seems to conflate the notion that \"Only OpenAI's ChatGPT constitutes a large language model.\" The title reads \"LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS ARE UNIVERSAL TABULAR PREDICTORS,\" but large language models include more than just ChatGPT, such as LLAMa and Falcon. It is well known that ChatGPT has strong generalization abilities, but the authors did not discuss whether their methods would still be effective on other large language models. The experimental results make it difficult to ascertain the validity of the authors' methods, as the results could simply stem from the power of the chosen foundation model rather than the methods themselves. Therefore, the conclusion stated in the title is not convincingly demonstrated.\n\n3.\tThe authors appear to have limited tabular prediction tasks to only classification problems, which is unreasonable. Tabular prediction also encompasses regression tasks. The authors should clarify which validation datasets involve classification versus regression to properly support the title conclusion of \"UNIVERSAL TABULAR PREDICTORS.\"\n\n4.\tPotential data leakage. The tabular data used for testing was sourced from the public Kaggle website. Due to the blackbox nature of the large language models used (not knowing what training data they have seen), we cannot be certain that the experimental results stem from the authors' fine-tuning rather than the LLMs having previously encountered related data from Kaggle.\n\n5.\tPoor reproducibility.

It might be better to demonstrate the performance of the model on datasets that have been used previously, just to get a sense of the model's performance compared to prior literature (eg the Blood, Bank, Calhousing, Car, Credit-g, Diabetes, Heart, Income and Jungle datasets as used in [1])\n3. Regarding baseline methods: some of the stronger baselines like TabPFN ([2]) would also be helpful in trying to understand the utility of the proposed method. In addition to that, the TabLLM baseline implemented is considerably weaker compared to what was proposed in the original paper. Concretely, the original paper uses T0, fine-tuned with T0-Few recipe [3]; which inherently has better instruction following capabilities compared to the GPT-2 backbone used in this paper. This makes the baseline somewhat artificially weak. It would be good to compare against the actual proposed methodology in [1] or (as mentioned above) evaluate on the datasets for which TabLLM reported the results, just to ensure a fair comparison.\n\n\n[1] Hegselmann, Stefan, et al. \"Tabllm: Few-shot classification of tabular data with large language models.\" International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics.

Concretely, (1) do the confidence estimates produced during generation form a valid probability distribution and (2) would it be possible to compute the calibration score for the produced probabilities (maybe something like the Expected Calibration Error, eg as done in [1])? LLMs have been shown to verbalize well calibrated outputs [2], but in my opinion, the degree of calibration observed would probably be a function of the compute used for training the model. \n\n2. The authors of TabLLM observed hallucinations to be a source of errors while using LLMs for reformatting purposes. Was this something that was also observed while generating the reformatted metadata ?\n\n3. Given that Unipredict-light does comparably / better than Unipredict-heavy, I am not entirely sure if including the metadata actually helps improve the model performance. The ablation study presented on page 8 argues that Unipredict-heavy is more robust because the loss in performance is less when not using the label confidence estimates during training. But I am not sure why having metadata (or lack thereof) should impact how the model handles confidence estimates. \n\nTypographic edits:\n1.

                "value": "The paper proposes UniPredict, a model for analytical predictions in tabular data. The work incorporates LLM to multiple tabular datasets, in which a single LLM is trained on an aggregation of 169 tabular datasets with diverse targets. The work compares its performance to other neural-network based and tree-based baselines, and show improvements in prediction performances, especially in in few-shot regimes."

Moreover, strength in few-shot learning scheme may also provide a hint for extending the work for a more robust pretrained model for prediction in tabular datasets."

For instance the example \"Listing 7, A.3\" shows an example with \"Unnamed: 0 is 2346\". This comes from the way of saving a csv file, in which it lists the index of datasets. In some cases, if the data is ordered by the magnitude of the target, this serves as a rank of the target, which might indicate a leakage of labels (target variables).\n- It would be good to observe how the proposed model performs on datasets with more samples in the few-shot settings.\n- Encoding categorical variables with ordinal encoder (for comparing methods) might not be the best option in handling categorical variables. It would also be good to have some comparison with models that handle categorical variables well (e.g., catboost).\n\nIt is unclear to interpret class probability as confidence. There should be a distinct definition of the terms for readers understanding."

                "value": "- How are the hyperparameters for the comparing baseline selected?\n- What are some statistical testing results on the performance comparisons? Can we really say that the proposed method outperform other comparing baselines?\n-  How does the model do in the few-shot regime where the number of samples is greater than the reported datasets?\n- Can we interpret the class probability (in the target augmenting step) as the confidence?\n- Are there better approaches in handling numerical values in the prompts? How does the model perform without using the numerical features?"
