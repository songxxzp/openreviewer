I wonder if the description of the method could be shortened in order to make more space available for related work and baselines.\n\nMany readers may not appreciate the challenges in spelling correction for Chinese.  I might start with a discussion like Jurafsky's book (https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/B.pdf), where they have a language model and a channel model.  You assume errors are just one character for one.  Chinese may be simpler than English in that respect.\n\nAs for the channel model, I'm surprised that you have just two models in mind: (1) random and (2) similar in OCR space.  I might have thought of some others like (3) similar in pinyin space, (4) dependencies involving dialects, (5) dependencies involving input methods (6) similar in distribution.  \n\nIt is well known that spelling correction depends a lot on the context.  We should expect to see very different errors depending on the keyboard.  Typos are different when the user is on a laptop or a phone.  Within phones, there are different keyboards.\n\nThe method of estimating the channel model is somewhat similar to the proposed method here.  They used a boot strapping method where they started with a very simple method to find typos that had just one reasonable correction.  They found  enough of those that they could then estimate confusion matrices.  That probably wouldn't work for Chinese, but it isn't that different from your proposal of training on cases where the probability of the correction is reasonably high."

Due to the lack of large corpus in the field of CSC, two data augmentation methods of random replacement and OCR/ASR-based generation is proposed to generate large-scale corpora. These methods introduce noise into the data, which subsequently causes over-correction. The authors analyze the calibration of the CSC models trained in the two corpora, and observe that random replacement results in better-calibrated CSC models. The authors then propose a corpus refining strategy to filter OCR/ASR-based data. Utilizing a BERT-based model trained on this refined corpus, the authors achieve commendable performance on CSC benchmarks, affirming the efficacy of the proposed method in mitigating over-correction."
