Extensive evaluation show that produced rationales are plausible and improve performance.\n\nMario works a follow. First, it trains a small LM to self-rationalize, with the help of GPT-3. Then, it casts the problem into a multi-reward conditioned rationale generation problem. The key is to leverage a multi-reward setup, where the dimensions to optimize are plausibility, diversity, consistency, and task accuracy. Each reward is based on an automated metric. At the end, the propose method only extend Quark [Lu et al. 2022], which limits the novelty (the proposed method is 3 paragraphs).\n\nThe experiments focus on QA datasets. The two variants of Mario don't seem to significantly outperforms the baselines, Classical underperforms on StrategyQA and Mario on the others. However, the human evaluation show more promising results, showing that automated evaluations are not enough on their own. Other datasets than QA ones should be used to show the generalization of the proposed method. For example, beer, hotel, or amazon datasets. The analysis on reward hacking and optimizing solely on task performance is very interesting.\n\nOverall the work is clear, well-written, and well-structured. It is a bit weird that the related work is put in the appendix. I would highly encourage the authors to move it back into the main paper. My concerns remain the novelty of the method - that seems to extend QUARK for multi-reward steup - and the lack of datasets that are not QA, especially when we are talking about rationalization."

In previous work, rationalizers are at significant scale,  and ignored the semantics of the rationales themselves. In this work, authors invented the MARIO algorithm for much smaller scale LM's to generate higher quality rationales, with multiple rewards for different quality properties of generated text rationales. Besides, generations from the algorithms seem to be more perferred for human experts."

The authors try not to take advantage of the scalability of large language models and instead use a much smaller distilled version of GPT.  Furthermore, the rewards\u2019 design is aiming at generating rationales with better semantic qualities rather than scoring better at the specific downstream task. I think this is a really good design philosophy for training algorithms."
