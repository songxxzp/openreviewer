The first set of experiments shows that this method can effectively remove a concept from synthetic MNIST data by (a) applying it to multiple wide layers and (b) using out-of-distribution concept datasets. The second set of experiments applies this method to (a) remove spurious concepts and improve worst-group accuracy in subpop robustness benchmarks and (b) reduces tcav sensitivity to spurious concepts in a fairness task."

The MNIST dataset is a good sanity check or starting point, but it is not enough to properly demonstrate the usefulness of this approach. A simple linear model can give 90% accuracy on the MNIST task and it is not representative of modern computer vision tasks. The experiments would be more convincing if the results hold on (a) \u201charder\u201d tasks such as CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100 and larger models (e.g., ResNet50 and ViTs)\n- The experiments in S4 do not adequately support RQ2 (concept datasets can be OOD). The OOD concept dataset considered  (EMNIST) is in fact quite similar to the MNIST dataset. It would be useful to provide a more nuanced understanding of when OOD concept datasets fail to remove concepts for example.\n- The experiments do not compare their results with relevant concept removal baselines such as LEACE (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03819) and kernel-space concept erasure (https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.405/). There is no related work section either, so it\u2019s hard for the readers to contextualize these findings.\n- As mentioned by the authors, the regularization term (Eq 3.2) is purely heuristic, so it is unclear if this approach of downweighting the CAV will work in general.\n- The deep concept removal method does not work on the Waterbirds dataset. In particular, it performs *significantly* worse than ERM. The authors do acknowledge this and hypothesize that their method may be more effective at removing high-level features than low-level features. However, this explanation is not convincing at all. What makes a concept high-level? Does this definition of high-level concept distinguish CelebA and \u201cstriped MNIST\u201d concept from waterbirds? I am not sure if subpopulation robustness is the right task to evaluate concept removal. The images in the concept dataset with and without the concept may differ in many ways other than the presence of the concept, and this may lead to a spurious CAV.\n- The figures are hard to parse (missing axes labels, legend too small). The writing in the second half (experiments, details, setup) can be significantly improved as well."
