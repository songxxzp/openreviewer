The method in Appendix B appears too naive and may pose a risk of incorrect sampling for time series pair selection.\n-\t2. Can you provide a more specific explanation of why the counterfactual of non-salient features is superior to ignoring that part (e.g., setting it to zero), as shown in Figure 1? Even though a zero value of $x$ does not affect the training to minimize the loss of prediction with weight $w$ as $wx$, using counterfactuals can have adverse effects.\n-\t3.

The task here is given a multivariate time series of factors to predicting an output variable to identify the regions of the input that are most predictive of the output, here defined by a binary mask. The presented technique uses a perturbative approach to compute the binary mask on the input factors. While perturbative approaches have been considered, it differs from other approaches in how it produces these perturbations. They use a contrastive (triplet) loss across samples  a smoothed sparse gate. They provide a series of experiments comparing performance to other perturbative and other approaches, such as Dynamask and Shapley Features. They use a synthetic white-box experiment with rare observation or time salience and show improved recall with their method compared to others, although all methods showed high precision. Similarly on a synthetic state-switching task they find improved recall, and perform ablations to show how  different inputs vary. They provide further examples using classification and with a real-world mortality task. There is a comprehensive supplement giving further documentation for the methods and experiments."

One of my reservations about this manuscript is even if the algorithm is novel it will be hard for others to appreciate. \n\n* In the white box experiments I had trouble appreciating the experimental design, which made it difficult to evaluate.

Perturbations have been among popular approaches to identify counterfactuals, but the paper argues, in time series these can be particularly challenging since perturbations can make samples OOD, rendering the resulting explanation meaningless to the original goal (i.e., finding a counterfactual). This is especially the case when considering the label-free perturbation scenario, which is less studied in literature. \n\nIn order to address this, the paper proposes a label-free Contrastive, and locally sparse perturbation approach that is more likely to generate in-domain perturbations. \n\nContraLSP has two main components -- first a contrasting objective that seeks to ensure perturbations are dissimilar from the the original time series and are \"more distracting\". There is also a sparse, stochastic gate for each feature to ensure sparsity in feature selection. The final objective contains 3 terms -- contrasting loss, a regularizer on the mask, and a proximal loss to ensure predictions are close to the original, un perturbed input."

The contrasting objective is the only source for potential counterfactual generation, that too it is not guaranteed to do so --  this distinction should be made more explicit in the text, and reduce the usage of perturbations being called counterfactuals. The experiments mostly only measure the ability of ContraLSP on identifying salient features, so this claim should be tempered down. \n* In this context, can the authors elaborate on the failures or weaknesses of ContraLSP? Specifically, when is it expected to fail, perhaps in comparison to techniques that work with labeled data?\n* **The contrasting objective** :  Since negatives are chosen at random, they are likely going to be weak negatives, and claiming these will be \"more counterfactual\" is probably not true. It must also be defined what \"more counterfactual\" means here -- more than what? How does the random negative selection ensure perturbations are crossing over class boundaries? Why is an L1 edit distance the right distance metric to do this? \n* **OOD Perturbations**  how does this objective _guarantee_ or at least ensure lack of OOD perturbations? Is the training of the perturbation function with contrastive loss sufficient to ensure this?\n* **Sparse gating and stochasticity**: Please define what the heavy-tailed nature of the sparse feature selection is, and how it is relevant to ContraLSP. The hard thresholding function in eqn (3) is only needed due to the random noise injected in the masking, since $\\mu'$ is a sigmoid function already.. why is the noise needed in the first place? \n* The paper's writing is not easy to follow, and this makes it hard to assess the core contribution of the work more rigorously. There are a lot of vague statements which are not stated clearly. Some of these are listed below:\n\t* \".. perturbation may not alleviate the distribution shift issue..\" (in the abstract)\n\t* \".. unregulated data distribution ..\" (in Sec 3)\n\t* \".. allows perturbed features to perceive heterogenous samples, thus increasing the impact of the perturbation..\" (Sec 4)\n\t* \".. counterfactual perturbations more distracting..\" (Sec 4.1)\n\t* \".. due to their heavy tailed nature..\" (Sec 4.2)\n* **Illustrations**: I recognize time series explanations are more challenging than visual data like imagery. However, the current set of illustrations are not very clear. For e.g. in Fig 5 why is the sum of salient observations shown? What is the inference from this figure? its very unclear, please make the key observations more explicit, perhaps with the help of a simpler dataset or time series and more consistent with Fig 1, which is easier to follow."
