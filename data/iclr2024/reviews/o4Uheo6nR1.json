One paper formalizes missingness shifts, while the other focuses on empirical studies. The authors should consider discussing the distinctions with their proposed formalization and approach.\n- Equation (2) relies on the assumption: $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon \\mid X_{obs}, M] = 0$. Authors should detail this assumption, its meaning and its real-world relevance. Particularly, does it not imply some independence of Y upon the missing data?\n- In Section 4, there is an implicit assumption of no covariate or concept shift. Making this explicit would enhance clarity for readers.\n- The paper would be strengthened by detailing NeuMISE and why this modelling would better approximate the conditional expectations and a Bayes optimal model. \n- It would be beneficial to delve further into the discussion of Appendix F, particularly in addressing the unclear aspects of why the model performs less effectively when uncertainty increases.\n- While the empirical results employ real-world covariates, the analysis lacks a study of real-world missingness shifts. Considering a dataset with changing missingness processes would strengthen the experimental analysis.\n- Comparing the proposed approach with an end-to-end neural network that uses zero imputed data and mask as input seems a natural comparison to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed NeuMICE.\n\n\n[1] Zhou, H., Balakrishnan, S., & Lipton, Z.

In particular, please elaborate on how adjusting for Y in a source domain can induce missingness shift, but omitting Y results in a stable estimator.\n  * The discussion focuses strongly on the comparing methods that leverage informative missingness vs. \u201cunbiased\u201d estimators that do not. This seems to be a critical point for the paper overall (e.g. related to the second of the three contributions listed in the introduction section), but it did not come through clearly to me in the writing. Furthermore, it is not clear how (or if) this was evaluated in the experiments. This could perhaps be improved with additional exposition earlier in the paper that sets up this argument more clearly with specific hypotheses to be evaluated.\n* Can the results be generalized to binary outcomes? Naively, it seems like the additive noise model limits the direct applicability of this framework to binary outcomes.\n* Is the assumption that the error term in equation (2) depends only on the observed X and M limiting the generalizability of this work? Which aspects of the results would no longer hold if the error term were to depend on the full X?\n* Please comment on the relationship of the results of this work to Zhou et al 2023 \u201cDomain Adaptation under Missingness Shift\u201d and adjust claims regarding novelty and prior work, if appropriate."

This paper describes that when missing data indicators are available, domain adaptation under missingness shift reduces to a covariate shift problem. This finding seems to be related to one of the central contributions of this paper, which is that the optimal predictor remains unchanged if missingness only depends on observables in both the training and test environment.\n\n\n2. It\u2019s not clear to me what advantage NeuMISE (the authors\u2019 proposed method) has compared to the existing baseline in the presence of non-ignorable missingness shift. While the authors have some empirical results that NeuMISE performs outperforms other methods in the presence of non-ignorable missingness shift, I\u2019m skeptical that such a result holds in general. To my understanding, generalizing well to non-ignorable missingness shift should only be possible if the model is in some sense robust to a variety of non-ignorable missingness shift, and I would presume that such a model may trade off some performance on the source data for better generalization across target environments. Is that the type of result that we observe for NeuMISE? What is the reason that NeuMISE is more robust? Furthermore, what benefit does NeuMISE offer compared to existing baselines.\n\n3. It would be helpful to add a few concrete examples where missingness shifts occur in the real-world to motivate the research.\n\nImprovements:\n\n1. It would be helpful if the authors emphasize in their abstract/introduction that they focus on missingness in covariates, not labels. There is an extensive literature on learning with missing labels and it is somewhat unclear what type of missingness the authors are focusing on until the problem definition in Section 3.\n\n2. It would be nice to draw a connection between ignorable / non-ignorable missingness to ignorable / non-ignorable sample selection. \n\n[1] Zhou, Helen, Sivaraman Balakrishnan, and Zachary Lipton. \"Domain adaptation under missingness shift.\" International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics.
