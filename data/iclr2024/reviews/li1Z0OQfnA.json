                "value": "The authors try to shed light on a new chapter of algorithmic game theory -- i.e., nonconcave games. Nonconcave games are simply games where the utility function of each player is nonconcave with respect to their individual strategy.\n\nSuch games have come to the attention of theoreticians due to the advent of an array of machine learning applications. Traditional notions of individual rationality such as the Nash equilibrium need not exist in these games while relaxed notions of equilibria designed for nonconvex games can be intractable. Namely, local $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria is a strategy profile in which no agent can improve their utility more than $\\epsilon$ by only considering strategy deviations of distance $\\delta$ from the initial strategy. Yet, $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-local NE are either trivial to compute, PPAD-hard, or NP-hard (corresponding to the magnitude of $\\delta$ compared to the natural parameters of the game). The latter two cases are known as the *local* and the *global regime*.\n\nTo this end, the authors propose the notion of a *local correlated equilibrium* as to alleviate the intractability of local-NE in the local regime. After they define this new notion of equilibrium they review the notion of $\\Phi$-regret. Briefly, $\\Phi$-regret unifies various notions of regret (e.g., external regret, swap regret) under an umbrella definition; it is defined as the difference between in utility at the end of the online optimization process where the best strategy in hindsight is selected using a family of function $\\Phi$.\n\nThe latter notion is crucial not only for the purpose of an algorithmic solution as well as the notion of the equilibrium itself. An $(\\epsilon, \\Phi(\\delta))$-correlated equilibrium is roughly a correlated strategy profile that achieves small $\\Phi(\\delta)$-regret for each agent. $\\Phi(\\delta)$-regret is the $\\Phi$-regret where the family of modification functions only allow deviations in a radius of length $\\delta$.\n\nThe authors note that, to date, there does not exist an efficient algorithm for $\\Phi$-regret minimization for general sets $\\Phi$. As such, two families of $\\Phi$ are considered:\n* Interpolations between current strategies from fixed strategies\n* Deviations towards a given direction $v$ in a distance of length $\\delta$.\n\nThen, the authors utilize the existing online convex optimization framework (the gradient descent and optimistic gradient descent algorithms) to straightforwardly design algorithms that lead to $(\\epsilon, \\Phi(\\delta))$-correlated equilibria.\n\nAs a takeaway, the authors propose that solution concepts in nonconcave games should be *meaningful, universal, and tractable*.  I suspect these notions would take the place of rationality. Nevertheless, there is not an explicit discussion as to why their proposal attains these favorable properties."
