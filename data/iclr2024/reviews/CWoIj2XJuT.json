To solve the Unbalanced Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge problem, the authors want to extend the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure and discretize it. To do so, they derive a time-reversal formula with killing and birth terms which are used to adapt the IPF algorithm to the defined problem. Then they explain how to sample from their algorithm and empirically study it on synthetic and single-cell dynamic datasets."

                "value": "i) The paper is mathematically heavy and I find its clarity poor. A lot of important mathematical quantities are assumed to be known by the reader as well as some of their properties. For instance:\n1. The generator (Eq. 3) is not derived naturally and it is hard to understand what its purpose is at first.\n2. The decomposition of the generator K is briefly mentioned in Section 4 and the properties of the decomposed parts are assumed to be understood\n3. The DSB method [1] is described rapidly in the related work and it is hard to make the connections between the balanced and unbalanced cases on some concepts \n4. Generally because of the lack of presentation of the generator and the brief introduction on DSB, I find it hard to follow and understand the extension of the IPF algorithm (ie the full Section 4).\n\nii) I find the experiments not extensive enough. The authors only compared their method with one competitor. They could have also considered the following Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge problem approaches (that deal with the balanced case) [1,2,3] and if they cannot be applied to this dataset, they could have considered other single-cell datasets [4].\n\n[1] Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge with Applications to Score-Based Generative Modeling, De Bortoli et al.\n[2] Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge Matching, Shi et al.\n[3] Simulation-free Schr\u00f6dinger bridges via score and flow matching, Tong et al\n[4] TrajectoryNet: A Dynamic Optimal Transport Network for Modeling Cellular Dynamics: Tong et al."

Do you recover the original IPF and Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge?\n\nCan your method be applied to other single-cell dynamics datasets such as [4]? If so, how does your method compare to other methods?\n\nI think the submission's clarity could be improved a lot by giving more details on the Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge in the related work and linking the different concepts to their unbalanced extension in Sections 4 and 5. Currently, the knowledge and understanding of the DSB method are assumed to the reader, making it hard for non-experts to understand the paper and its theory.\n\nDue to the lack of clarity and the lack of competitors and datasets, I feel that this paper should go under a major revision to be accepted at ICLR. Therefore, my current vote is to reject the paper. While I find the theory to be strong and interesting, it might be possible that the paper's scope is too theoretical for a machine-learning venue like ICLR.\n\n###################\nEdit post rebuttal:\n###################\nThank you for the rebuttal. I agree that this is a mathematical paper. In my opinion, it deserves a major rewriting to make it accessible to a larger audience and to non-experts in order for them to understand how to apply the proposed method to real-world problems. \n\nThank you for the novel experiments. I still think that it would be valuable to the paper to consider other single-cell datasets like [4]. \n\nDue to the mentioned weaknesses above, I keep my current score."

It is good for those who familiar with previous SB/DSB works, but I believe most of the ICLR audiences are not familiar with that.

Furthermore, there is only a single baseline for the cell dynamics interpolation task when many specialized methods exist for this task. For me this is the single weakest part of the paper. I would like to see additional comparisons to cell dynamics methods, particularly those based on branching SDEs.\n- Placement with regard to existing work: I believe the authors missed work on Trajectory Inference [1,2,3]. Comparison to these methods which also account for cell growth and death in an SDE formulation would greatly strengthen this work and provide context on other ways this problem has been addressed.\n- UDSB requires known killing and / or birth rates which may limit in practical applications. It seems like these may be difficult to tune in practice, but the freedom to set them is nonetheless quite interesting.\n- Some of the experimental setting is quite unclear at least to me (see questions below).\n\n[1] Lavenant, H., Zhang, S., Kim, Y., & Schiebinger, G.

If the middle timepoint is left out, how is it known that the observed mass increases 35% but then decreases to -25% from the original total mass? The appendix just states a 80/20 test split.\n- The requirement that $k$ is non-negative is not a standard requirement in unbalanced dynamic OT. This seems to be necessary in the theory, but is not a requirement in practice. I did not understand why. Could the authors explain this / clarify in the text?\n- More of a comment than a question, \u201csimulating virus spread\u201d is mentioned once in the intro, in the conclusion with an extended experiment in the supplement. I think either this should appear in the main text or not be included. I don\u2019t really understand why this is not in the experiments.\n\n----\nPost rebuttal Edit:\n\nI thank the authors for taking time to respond with additional clarifications. My concerns remain re: general applicability and experimental validation, therefore my score remain the same. \n\nI think additional validation would improve this work. I suggest the Root dataset from here: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009466\n\nas it has outside observations of approximate cell count via imaging.\n\nI think it would be great to show tangible benefits on datasets without this type of prior knowledge too."
