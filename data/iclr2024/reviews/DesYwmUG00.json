On the experimental side, it is analyzed, from different works, the benefit of using SDEs over ODEs in step 3."

Actually, I do not think that the paper properly gives the answer to this question. This is link to the following point.\n- It is not clear that the proposed theoretical arguments prove the right point. Given $x_0$ (resp. $\\tilde x_0$) sampled from the latent $x_{t_0}$ (resp.  $\\tilde x_{t_0}$. ), with Theorem 3.1, it is proven that the $x_0$ and $\\tilde x_0$ are closer \u201cin distribution\u201d than $x_{t_0}$ and $\\tilde x_{t_0}$. Why is that desired ? \nI think that the authors see $p_0$ as the distribution of clean images $q_0$, and then wish to minimize $KL(p_0, \\tilde p_0)$ to get well-looking images. However, $p_0$ is very different from $q_0$ because the score is not (and for from being) perfectly matched with the denoiser. From this fact, could the authors explain why it makes sense to try to minimize $KL(p_0, \\tilde p_0)$ ? I am more likely to think that, for the purpose of image editing, it does not make sense to try to minimize the distance between these two distributions. \n- In the experimental section, some important information is missing : which model are you using, trained on which dataset ? \n\nMinor weaknesses : \n- In the paragraph \"Samples\" from Section 2. The term \"equivalent\" is not true. Sampling is not \"equivalent\" to discretization ! Moreover, discretizing (4) or (5) does not enable to sample from $q_0$ if the score is not perfectly matched with $\\epsilon_\\theta$.\n- The ODE inversion process explanation should be clarified. The links and differences between deterministic ODE inversion and random Gaussian noise should be explained. \n- The \"mild assumption\" should be detailed, at least in the Appendix."
