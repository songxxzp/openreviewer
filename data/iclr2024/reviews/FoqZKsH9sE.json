It seems the authors may not thoroughly discuss the milestone contributions in the related works. There's a potential confusion between pruning at initialization and post-training pruning. Notably, pivotal works such as Han 2015 [1, 2] and HRank 2020 [3] are absent, while references to some arXiv papers are included. I recommend that the authors structure the related works section with more precise logic. Also, the authors claim that CNNs pruning can be divided into three categories, yet only two are presented. \n2. What is the i.d.d. in Assumption 1?\n3. The experimental results presented seem limited. In Table 1, the authors only explore DeiT-small and Base. It would be beneficial if the authors expanded their experiments to include, at least, DeiT-Tiny, T2T, and other ViTs, considering various pruning ratios. Also, the improvement from UVC is minimal on Deit-Base model. \n\n[1] Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman Coding.\n[2] Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource Efficient Inference\n[3] HRank: Filter Pruning using High-Rank Feature Map"

The performance of vision transformers is usually bounded by the memory accesses, especially for those edge devices. So memory accesses should also be taken into account.\u00a0\u00a0\n* The experiments are only conducted on the DeiT models, which use global attention. It is better to conduct more experiments on other vision transformer models, such as the Swin Transformer, which has been widely used nowadays.\n* Experiments are insufficient. The authors only evaluate the proposed method on the classification task. It is better to discuss the generalization of the method and evaluate different tasks.\n* Only show the FLOPs reduction, without the real speedup. Even with the adoption of block-wise sparsity, there is still some overhead during inference, especially for the sparse model with small block shapes.

It seems like an additional parameter $p_m$ has been added to the FLOPs constraint.\n* Were all the experiments fine-tuned for 300 epochs? If that is the case, it should not be referred to as a post-training method, as illustrated in the abstract. In addition, it is unfair to compare the baseline in Table 1. The baseline in Table 1 is not training with the knowledge distillation, but the LSP models are fine-tuned with 300 epochs with knowledge distillation. And the accuracy of the distilled DeiT-Small and DeiT-Base should be 81.2% and 83.4%, respectively."
