To this end, they introduce a new high-quality Q&A dataset, FreshQA, comprising 600 questions. They evaluate the performance of multiple LLMs under two regimes: STRICT, in which an answer is correct if and only if the reasoning and the answer are correct, and RELAXED, in which it is sufficient for the answer to the question to be correct. This sheds light on whether the models can arrive at the correct answer while hallucinating some facts about the world. To improve performance, the authors devise a method to incorporate search results from Google into the context of the LLM. The conclusion is that LLMs struggle with fast-changing and false premise questions (although GPT-4 seems to perform quite well on these types of questions if the knowledge is before its cut-off date), and retrieval-augmented generation improves the performance of LLMs."

                "value": "Thanks to the authors for the thoroughly executed paper. Although I think that the results are not particularly unexpected or novel (e.g. LLMs struggle with multi-hop questions as noted in Self-Ask, or questions that involve fresh, novel and changing knowledge, and that retrieval from a search engine helps), I think the main scientific contribution of this paper might be considered the high-quality dataset of questions.\n\nThis leads us to the main weakness of the paper. If I understand correctly, the evaluation in this paper is performed exclusively by human annotation. While I appreciate this substantial evaluation effort, it raises some concerns, especially given that one of the authors' goals is to provide this dataset to the community to facilitate further research in this field.\n\nHow many annotators were used to perform each system's evaluation in this paper? Inter-annotator agreement between two evaluators on a subset of 100 questions is reported in the appendix, and it is shown that the agreement is high. Do the authors expect everyone in the research community using the dataset to follow the same evaluation protocol to assess their own systems?\n\nThese questions leave me wondering whether the authors could have created an automatic evaluation metric that might make the dataset more broadly useful to the community and less subject to annotator variance.\n\nFor example, by carefully crafting the questions with multiple-choice answers (with carefully selected hard negative options that could elicit some of the capabilities the authors are examining, e.g., integrating options with incorrect reasoning but correct answers). Multiple-choice is a strategy already used in well-known QA benchmarks such as MMLU or the suite of the original 11 T0 held-out tasks and lends itself nicely to computing accuracy. Can the authors elaborate on why they didn't choose this option?\n\nOverall, I appreciate the effort put into this paper, but I am a bit unsure about the broad usability of such dataset in the current state. I hope the authors can help me clarify these doubts and, if so, I will be more than willing to increase my score."
