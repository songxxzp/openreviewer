Experiments show that the method can effectively improve the performance of the base model without a significant increase in computation, and effectively alleviate the oversmoothing problems."

                "value": "1\uff09The motivation for the paper is not adequately supported by theory. The paper mentions that better flexibility and customization can be achieved by considering the self-attention mechanism as a graph filter in graph signal processing, but does not cite enough papers or theorems to fully convince this point. In addition, when proving that the self-attention matrix conforms to the three properties of the transition matrix required by the convergence of pagerank algorithm, the authors only make a rough qualitative analysis but do not carry out a more sufficient and detailed analysis and relevant theoretical or experimental proof. Since the self-attention matrix in the transformer is unpredictable, once it does not meet the corresponding requirements, the self-attention based on matrix polynomials will not be able to approximate the graph filter, and thus will not be able to realize the expected results. Therefore, I suggest the authors to provide more details in this regard.\n \n \n2\uff09Some experimental data with excessive errors will interfere with the experimental results. In the experimental part, the error range of individual experimental results is too large relative to other data. For example, 70.9\u00b113.90 in Table 2 and 58.1\u00b124.32 in Table 3. When these margins of error are taken into account, it becomes a question which method yields the best experimental results. This may potentially interfere with the fairness of comparisons between different methods, thereby affecting the correctness of experimental results.\n \n \n3\uff09The applicability of CheAtt should be further discussed. The paper mentioned that the effect of CheAtt is very dependent on the quality of the base model. As can be seen from Table 1 and Table 4, in TabTransformer and MET, the effect of CheAtt is outstanding, but there is almost no improvement in SAINT. They are all table representation methods based on transformer, and the original performance of SAINT is the best among the three. So what exactly does the \"quality of the base model\" mentioned in the paper refer to? According to the author's analysis, self-attention based on Chebyshev polynomials can improve the flexibility of the self-attention mechanism. This improvement should not be strongly related to the base model, so do the experimental results mean that CheAtt is not applicable in many situations? I suggest that the authors conduct further analysis in this area.\n \n \n4\uff09The complexity of CheAtt still needs further discussion. First, the data in Table 5 are all in the range of a few milliseconds, does it refer to the time to generate output after the model training is completed? If so, this does not take into account the large number of matrix multiplication operations required during model training. In addition, it is meaningless to only compare the absolute time difference, and it is more convincing to compare the relative time consumption. It can be seen that in Phishing dataset, the additional time spent can exceed up to 40% of the original, which is a huge and unacceptable increase. Another question is why in the MET+CheAtt method and Phishing dataset, the time after using CheAtt is reduced (from 2.7538 to 2.4625). Is this a clerical error or real experimental data? I recommend the authors to perform a more comprehensive analysis and more realistic experiments in terms of computational complexity."
