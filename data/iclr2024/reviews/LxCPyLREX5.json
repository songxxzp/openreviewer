For the first part, this paper proposes VRLS, a regularized version of the MLLS method. The authors further show that the optimization problem can be approximately solved by an EM procedure. The second part introduced how to apply the VRLS algorithm to the federated learning setting. Theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity of the density ratio label density ratio estimator and the convergence rate of the IW-ERM algorithm are provided. Extensive experiments are also conducted to evaluate the proposed methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The weaknesses of the paper are as follows:\n- Unclear main focus: While the paper is titled \"Federated Learning under Label Shifts with Guarantees,\" I noticed that a significant portion appears to study the classical label shift problem in supervised learning. In particular, Section 3 only briefly touches upon applying the proposed density ratio estimation to federated learning, but it lacks a detailed algorithm description and a thorough discussion of its contributions. In Section 4, Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 seem to offer limited insight into how the proposed algorithm might effectively tackle the challenges of federated learning. Specifically, Theorem 1 seems to pertain only to a single client, and the presentation of Theorem 2 is somewhat confusing, as discussed in the next point.\n\n- Clarity of Theorem 2: The statement of Theorem 2 strikes me as somewhat informal, particularly due to my uncertainty regarding the definition of the notation $\\ell$. In Section 2, it is defined as the loss function on a single sample. In light of this, it's not unclear to me how the theorem relates to the objective Eq.(IW-ERM) that the authors are trying to minimize. Moreover, the proof of Theorem 2 seems to be a straightforward application of (Liu et al., 2023, Theorem 4.1). It's not clear how this theorem perspective helps to enhance our understanding of the federated learning problem.\n\n- Unclear theoretical advantages: As indicated by Eq (3.1) and Eq. (3.2), the proposed method appears similar to MLLS with the difference that the model $\\theta^*$, is trained with an additional regularization term. While the experiments demonstrate the benefit of this additional regularization, Theorem 3 shows a similar convergence rate for the proposed VRLS when compared to MLLS. I think the theorem will be more appealing if the authors can provide a more precise explanation of why the regularization helps with the label shift problem.\n\n- Empirical comparison: a closely related work is [1] as cited by the authors, which also considers adding a regularization term to perform for the label density ratio estimation. I think the experiments will be more convincing by also taking [1] as a compared method.\n\n[1]  Azizzadenesheli et al.  Regularized learning for domain adaptation under label shifts. In ICML 2019."

                "value": "1. The connection between the optimization problem in Eq.(Reg-Est) and that shown by Eq.(3.1) and Eq.(3.2) is not immediately clear to me. In Eq.(Reg-Est), the regularization term is incorporated into the training of the density ratio, whereas in Eq.(3.1), it appears to be a part of the loss function to train the classifier $\\theta^*$. It would be beneficial if the author could clarify this by providing a more formal statement that establishes the equivalence between these two optimization problems.\n\n2. Could you provide a more comprehensive theoretical explanation of how the proposed help to minimize goal Eq.(IW_ERM) mentioned in Section 2?  (Please refer to the second point of weaknesses for more details.)\n\n3. I think this paper would be more appealing if the authors could show the advantage of the proposed method over MLLS from a theoretical view.

In FL, there is only limited communication and this critical aspect is not categorized by these theorems. I am wondering how many communication rounds the algorithm requires to obtain a statistical and computational guarantee.\n\n2. Experimental results are weak. Tacking data heterogeneity is a well-known problem in federated learning (e.g., FedProx [r1], SCAFFOLD [r2], minibatch SGD [r3], etc.). However, it seems that the authors only consider FedAvg and FedBN as baselines. I suggest the authors also compare against these papers, which were also proposed to learn a global model with client data heterogeneity.\n\n[r1] Li, Tian, Anit Kumar Sahu, Manzil Zaheer, Maziar Sanjabi, Ameet Talwalkar, and Virginia Smith. \"Federated optimization in heterogeneous networks.\" Proceedings of Machine learning and systems 2 (2020): 429-450.\n\n\n[r2] Karimireddy, Sai Praneeth, Satyen Kale, Mehryar Mohri, Sashank Reddi, Sebastian Stich, and Ananda Theertha Suresh. \"Scaffold: Stochastic controlled averaging for federated learning.\" In International conference on machine learning, pp. 5132-5143.

The authors did not report the communication round result in the experiments section. It is unclear whether improves over FedAvg or  FedBN when there is only limited communication. There is still a huge gap between the IW-ERM and the upper-bound performance (Table 3)."
