While the motivation lies in the exploitation of dependence between variables, the experiment shows better performance and improvement for CI methods compared with CD methods, which is kind of contradicted. Could you provide more insight into the possible reasons?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe following questions stem from what I believe are confusions arising from differences between different fields (which won't influence my rating): \n\nQ2.  Is it possible to provide a formal definition of  **locally stationary lead-lag relation** as \"influence requires a certain time delay to propagate and take effect\" is not clear to interpret mathematically? Furthermore, in the context of cross-correlation used to quantify such relationships, does this indicate that a lead-lag relationship is inferred whenever we observe relatively larger cross-correlation in differing time slots between two variables? (In the causality field, the correlation is not equivalent to influence and effect).\n \nQ3. As a continuation of my previous question, the use of cross-correlation for identifying lead-lag relationships suggests a focus on linear associations. May I inquire if this suggests that the algorithm's applicability is confined to variables that share a linear relationship (e.g., $X_1 = X_2^2$, the cross-correlation will return zero)?"

As introduced in locally stationary lead-lag relationship, such relationship should be static only in a short period of time, which may indicate that it may not work well in long-term forecasting. However, the author also claims good performance for that case. Some elaboration on this will be very helpful.\n3. As a plug-and-play module that works on top of the baseline predictions, some fair comparison about the computation cost such as the total computation load should be considered.

The authors propose a forecasting algorithm called LIFT that exploits dependencies among the time series by first finding a set of leading time series and their corresponding leading steps for a given time series and then uses a Lead-aware Refiner that adaptively leverages the informative signals of leading indicators in the frequency domain to refine the predictions of lagged variates. The first step, i.e., finding the leading time series and their corresponding steps is designed based on Wiener\u2013Khinchin theorem that uses fast Fourier transformation. The second step contains two main parts: state estimation and a frequency mixer. They evaluate the performance of LIFT through several experiments and their result shows that LIFT makes an average improvement over both CI and CD methods."

What if there are more complex interactions in which two or more time series jointly influence another time series? A reason that in some applications CI is outperforming CD methods could be the result of such misspecified interactions in the CD methods.   \n\nConsider a setting in which the influence structure among  the time series is a chain, i.e., $X^{(1)} -> X^{(2)} -> \\cdots -> X^{(C)}$. In this case, there are scenarios in which the pairwise cross-correlations between $X^{(C)}$ and {$X^{(i)}: 1\\leq i\\leq C-2$} are all higher than the correlation between $X^{(C)}$ and $X^{(C-1)}$.
