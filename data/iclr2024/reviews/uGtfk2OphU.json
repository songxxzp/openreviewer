                "value": "This paper studies selective rationalization. Existing methods suffer at some extent from spurious correlation (i.e., shortcuts). The authors propose shortcuts-fused selective rationalization (SSR) to mitigate spurious correlation. More specifically, they employ semi-supervised rationalization: given an annotated datasets of rationals and labels, they train SSR on it. Then, they train an unsupervised rationalization method on the same data and use the previous model to identify spurious tokens. This new knowledge is then transferred to the unsupervised setup. Since the main method relies on annotated data, the authors propose two data augmentation techniques to mitigate the low-amount of available data.\n\nThe method where one exploits a supervised rationalization model to identify spurious rational tokens from an unsupervised model is interesting, but relies on a \"large\" amount of available rationales. Overall, a supervised rationalization model has to be trained to improve an unsupervised one, which greatly limits the applicability of the method, even though a data augmentation approach is proposed. I would be curious whether transferring the knowledge from one task to another could be possible to some extent (not necessary from movie-dataset-1 to movie-dataset-2).\n\nThe experiment section is lacking unsupervised baselines and standard datasets used in selective rationalization [1-6, to cite a few but more are missing] (should also be included in the related work section). In terms of dataset: beers, hotels, amazon, and the other tasks of ERASER. Moreover, I would highly encourage the authors to conduct a human evaluation regarding the produces rationales. The relationship between the number of augmented data vs task/rational performance is currently unclear. I would appreciate having a graph showing how the performance evolve according the number of added data.\n\n1 Bao et al. 2018, Deriving machine attention from human rationales (EMNLP) 2 Chan et al. 2022, UNIREX: A Unified Learning Framework for Language Model Rationale Extraction (ICML) 3 Antognini et al. 2021, Multi-Dimensional Explanation of Target Variables from Documents (AAAI) 4 Chang et al. 2019, A Game Theoretic Approach to Class-wise Selective Rationalization (NeurIPS) 5 Antognini and Faltings 2021, Rationalization through Concepts (ACL) 6 Yu et al. 2019, Rethinking Cooperative Rationalization: Introspective Extraction and Complement Control (EMNLP)"

Here, rationalisation is an attempt to find fragments that influence the final classification The authors note that frequently, in unsupervised approaches, algorithms search for so-called shortcuts, which, while they may be strongly, but spuriously, correlated with the final classification, do not in any way explain the real reasons for a given classification. They therefore suggest a combination of supervised algorithms, where the true rationales (input elements influencing the classifications) are predefined by experts, and unsupervised methods, where the rationales are searched for. The proposal is thus to exclude those unsupervised rationalizations found that are not defined by experts. By excluding these unnecessary shortcuts, the proposed SSR algorithm achieves results that are similar to SOTA approaches, beating many other approaches.\n\nThe use of ChatGPT in appendix C.2 where it, essentially, selects the proposed approach over other methods, is nice and might be entertaining, but it does not introduce anything to the problem at hand. I would remove it, if I were you. But you, naturally, may do as you please.\n\nThe work on this subject is clearly very much needed these days. On the other hand, I think that this paper does not introduce new ideas. The use, or rather the exclusion of the \u201cshortcuts\u201d in a model, does not introduce enough new knowledge to push the model prediction understanding much."

There is no clearly stated hypothesis at the beginning of the text. The approach may be obvious to the author, but readers will not understand and will abandon reading before the end.\n4. The authors introduce a number of loss functions which can be used in different configurations, with no clear intuition which should be used and why.\n5. The authors introduce \u201cdata augmentation\u201d DA approaches into their model. However, they seem to have forgotten the MixedDA solution, which is in the tables but not in the description (section 3.3). The models with and without augmentation are compared, and in some cases of algorithms or data one type of augmentation gives better results, but these results are not consecutive (see table 1). It seems to me that the augmentation ideas not really matter. The differences are small, in any case.\n6. The text introduces a great deal of patterning, both when describing existing methods and the author's own proposal. This does not make it easy to read, as many of them do not explain the next steps in any way, such as the definition of Gumbel-softmax on page 3."

The authors use only one example ('received a lukewarm approach' in the film review) throughout the article. Doesn't such a solution reduce the proposal to a supervised approach? Please use another example of a shortcut.\n2 The entire article is written in a way that is difficult to understand. There is no clearly stated hypothesis at the beginning of the text. The approach may be obvious to the author, but readers will not understand and will abandon reading before the end. Could you clearly state your hypothesis in the introduction?\n3. Is the whole of section 2 your proposition, or the definition of possible solutions used now? It is not clear.\n3. A number of cost functions are given that are to be utilized in different configurations.  Since the background models are quite complex (Transformer, both as encoder and encoder/predictor, as well as other generative models) these loss functions tend to be complex too. Some might be removed with more intuition on the more important in exchange.\n4. What actually is the \u201cshortcut imitator\u201d (pages 5 and 6 and later), what is it used for?\n5. Please explain what is the MixedDA augmentation in subsection 3.3.\n6. In the results tables, these with the best value are bold-faced as the best. But the mean differences may be as low as 0.1%, which statistically are not, in any way, significant. The authors should perform some statistical analysis and group the algorithms into groups of statistical equivalence (see e.g. Demsar, Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple data sets, JMLR 7, 2006; open software for that approach is available).\n\nLess essential:\n1. Difficulty in reading may come from poor English. I suggest the involvement of a native speaker.\n2. Instead of very many formulas, drawing diagrams of the methods should be shown, which would explain much more. Also, nothing is contributed by the detailed descriptions of all cost functions in the description of the general methods as well as the own proposal.\n3. in table 3 the result 90.7 for SSR_unif with DA is chosen as best, even though that of WSEE with DA of 91.0 mean seems better. That is perhaps a typing error, or is it?"

Unlike \"rationales\", there are are pieces of text called \"shortcuts\" that can result in correct prediction but are not proper justifications of the label. The exact difference between rationales and shortcuts is not clearly defined in the paper, so it seems that the distinction is problem-specific and ultimately something that is left to the practitioner. Previous selective rationalization methods can be categorized into supervised, where the rationales are provided during training, and unsupervised, where they have to be inferred during training process. The paper proposes a semi-supervised approach (an extension of a couple of recent papers) where a selector model trained in the unsupervised way is applied to smaller supervised data to identify the shortcuts and retrain the selector model. In addition, two data augmentation methods were proposed to enrich the shortcut discovery. The proposed approach is evaluated in 4 datasets. The model outperforms previous SOTA unsupervised and semi-supervised methods on both rationale prediction and label prediction tasks. The performance is also\ncomparable to the supervised baselines"

Such predictions can help us analyze the reasoning ability of large language models (LLM).\n- The authors conducted comprehensive experiments on more than 10 variants of the proposed approach. Informative discussions are also presented. Tests are performed on four datasets from diverse domains and results are compared with SOTA baselines from all 3 groups of previous methods. Such rich experiments clearly show how each add-on piece affects the overall model performance. The limitations and potential reasons for certain outcomes are also deeply analyzed and discussed.\n- The data augmentation opens up a new approach to enriching labeled data in this area. Instead of using LLMs to augment new instances, which can be inefficient in both computing source and cost, the authors propose to use random/similar tokens to replace shortcuts. Such simple approaches, especially the random one, surprisingly yield promising results."

The author asserts that unsupervised methods frequently identify shortcuts as inefficient rationales and provides examples. Yet, the reader would be curious about how often that happens, and if the model already yields good results, why do we have to give up shortcuts? I suggest a stronger argument for why finding a good rationale is significant, such as it can be helpful for other reasoning tasks.\n- The manuscript's writing style can be perplexing in several sections, notably in Methodology (Section 3). Mathematical expressions should be consistent, straightforward, and clear, and should only be included when indispensable. For example, instead of writing an algorithm for the semantic data augmentation, the reader might be more interested in seeing how specifically you\ndo the semanticly similar word retrieval in Appendix A.\n- It is hard to understand why sharing selector parameters in both supervised/unsupervised phases is not the default setting.
