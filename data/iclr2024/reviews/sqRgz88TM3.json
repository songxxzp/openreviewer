However, the experiments did not validate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics. What is the evidence that shows that the proposed metrics indeed work, representing the real ability of the evaluated algorithms?\n\n- The paper claims to \u201cimplement basic VFL training and evaluation flow under multiple model partition, communication protocols and attacks and defences algorithms using datasets of different modality\u201d. But it lacks a clear exposition of the workflow. What is the training and evaluation flow in VFLAIR and how does the workflow facilitate the benchmarking? \n\n- Following on the above point, the evaluation section is not organised systematically according to model partition, communication protocols, and attack and defence algorithms. The current evaluation section only amounts to a compilation of experimental results, which \nrequires a more structured, systematic and coherent organization. \n\nThere is only one paragraph in related work.

The introduction of the framework is limited.

The insights in Section 6 should be highlighted. Currently, the paragraph is too long (especially Section 6.2) and readers are hard to find interesting results from the experiments. I suggest the authors put the insights at the beginning of each subsection.\n\n3. It seems that the paper divides the datasets into multiple subsets equally. Non-IID data partitioning is an important factor in FL and would be good to be included in VFLAIR.
