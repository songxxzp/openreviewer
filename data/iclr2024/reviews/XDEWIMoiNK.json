The paper mentions that the main challenge of the object rearrangement task is precise localization, but I fail to see how the localization of either the agent or the objects is a challenge in these environments. Have the authors tried classical visual odometry or monocular slam with object detection to register the objects in a map? The proposed L-Net seems kind of an overkill in this setup. The authors also mention that partial observability and their choice of using a single first-person RGB view makes the problem harder. The environment is small enough without obstacles that it can be fully observed in very few views, while including an RGB-D sensor is a fair assumption in robotic settings. \n\nEven in cases where the localization is a challenge, it is an orthogonal problem to the re-arrangement task. I am expecting that the planning is more of a bottleneck here due to the non-trivial sequence of actions that need to be decided (i.e., moving a certain object first might lead to a state where an optimal solution is not possible anymore). This is also recognized as the main challenge of this problem by Batra et al. (2020a)."

The reviewer is concerned that these two extreme simplifications in the environment mean that any conclusions drawn won't transfer to more realistic settings. This concern is reinforced by the result that CLIP features were not appropriate for this environment.\n\nAdditional baselines are needed for L-NET. The embodied AI literature has a large number of tracking methods that were developed for PointGoal navigation, see Partsey et al 2022 for one example.\n\nThe name \"Mobile Object Rearrangement (MOR)\" is confusing as the word mobile could also be used to describe the agent being mobile and differentiate the task from table-top rearrangement.\n\nThe figure 3 caption is very long and has key method details.
