Disregarded Prompts:\nDuring the iterative training process, when a new prompt is introduced to optimize the loss function, the model (either the generator or the discriminator) engages in in-context learning, regardless of whether the new prompt is accepted or discarded. It's worth noting that discarded prompts can also impact the model's training, but the paper does not explore this aspect in detail.\n\nW2-b. Unclear Origin of Benefits:\nThe observed performance improvements in the experiments may not be solely attributed to the accepted examples but could also be influenced by the discarded ones. Furthermore, given that the optimization process relies on the stochastic behavior of large language models, it's possible that the learning effect results from the repeated trial-and-error of prompt modifications occurring during the training iterations rather than from improved prompts. Therefore, the assumption that improvements in experimental results are solely due to adversarial training may not be valid."

Similar to traditional adversarial learning, there is a minimax game between the generator and the discriminator, where the generator aims to generate realistic text to fool the discriminator. The generator is provided with task instructions, several exemplars, and input at each round and produces the output; the discriminator then tries to decide whether the generator input-output pair is real data or model generated. After that, the prompt modifier makes changes to the generator, and the discriminator prompts to improve the adversarial loss. They perform a set of experiments using both open and closed-source models on various generation and classification tasks to evaluate their model."
