Can the author provide a useful example?\n\nIt seems like all the experiments in the paper can be treated as ODE-like dynamical system, so I was wondering what is the major difference here?\n\n2.There is a missing literature review regarding invariant learning and its application in data-driven dynamical system learning, there are a few branches of related work worth mentioning and they are very close to the topic in this paper:\nPhysics/Conservation invariant:\n\n\"Hamiltonian neural networks.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 32 (2019).\n\nLagrangian Neural Networks.

This induces a new algebra that should somehow be given by the parameterization of the model. The empirical results are also very good and suggest that the model outperforms the baseline methods."

For one, there is no guarantee that the model will converge to something that has these separable parameter sets within the motivation of the work. The loss function seems rather standard in the sense that it is the standard loss when one parameterizes a latent variable time series model. It would have been nice to show under what assumptions does the model decompose into the disjoint parameter sets -- the invariant ones and the instance-specific ones.\u00a0\n\nWhile this is a small weakness, the paper seems to claim a bit too much (though I may have also misunderstood). For example, the authors mention they make no assumptions on the structure of the model in the sense of an ODE type of factorization, but still the fact that the first $K$ steps of the time series are used for conditioning does induce a particular structure. In some sense, the ODE interpretation is amenable since one can use the known properties of ODEs to probe the model.\n\nA major goal is to generalize the output on a new domains where some invariant properties are maintained, but the experiments only demonstrated this in the case of changing parameters. However, maybe it would be helpful to see the behavior under shifts in the observation distribution.\u00a0For example, could the distribution of the observation space change in a trivial way (e.g. different color map for the wave equation example) and could the distribution still be predicted?\n\nThere are also some properties that the authors impose in their loss (e.g. smoothness of the latent space) but that assumption seems to violate some of the motivating ideas behind the paper. Smoothness almost implies a differential equation in the latent space."

Will the smoothness and Gaussian terms will force the learned dynamics to resemble something that satisfies an ODE?"

The learned latent dynamics model can be queried at irregular times, and the predicted dynamics decoded via a CNN-based decoder model and compared with the data.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "General problem setting:\n\nWhat is meant by invariant? To my understanding the term \u201cinvariant\u201d in this paper mostly refers to the flow of the underlying system (i.e. the equations given in Appendix 1), while the realization-specific components are different initial conditions from which different observations start. This is also the situation primarily studied in the experimental section. The authors claim to show \"generalization well beyond the data distributions seen during training\".\nHowever, the setting they mostly investigate is just the standard setting in dynamical systems reconstruction, where underlying dynamical processes/flow fields are inferred from multiple or even single observations. I don't think this constitutes generalization beyond the data distribution in the usual sense.\n\nMore interesting to my mind is the question of transfer learning e.g. between different dynamical regimes (as studied out in 6.2.) with different parameter settings of the underlying system, or even between different but in some way related systems. Relating this to a more formal language common in dynamical systems theory might be helpful, since for dynamical systems the concept of invariants, such as topological invariants, fixed points, periodic orbits, Lyapunov spectra, invariant measures etc. is well studied. While the abstract mentions the motivation to \u201c enforce certain scientifically-motivated invariances\u201d these invariances are not really made explicit in the related work or in the analysis of the obtained results and remained somewhat elusive to me.\nFurther, while you mention that your approach \u201cis in principle not specific to physical ODE-like models\u201d, these are the only systems you actually study in the experiments, which naturally suggests are framing in these terms.\n\nTransfer learning setting (6.2.)\n\nYour framework is aimed at transfer learning from \u201cpotentially highly heterogeneous parameters and data\u201d, which as mentioned seems the more novel application of your framework. Most of the empirical section however focuses on multiple instantionations of the same underlying system. The results from 6.2., where transfer learning between different model parameters is learned, however indicate that the transfer effect is relatively weka, with advantages over learning from scratch remaining within the error bars, and comparative performance requiring a significant portion of the new training set (if I understood it correctly corresponding to hundreds of tractories from the altered system).\n\nInterventions/nonstationarities in parameters for dynamical systems can also be viewed through the lense of bifurcations. Increasing the Reynolds number can e.g. induce turbulence, as you rightly point out. From your description it is not altogether clear what changes in the dynamics your parameter changes in this section induce, and whether they lead to qualitative differences.\nSince to my understanding this transfer is the primary motivation for introducing your framework, I found this section to be a little too short and and not in-depth enough.\nI also wasn't 100% sure if you indeed jointly trained on different Reynolds numbers for the flow around a blunt body (Re = 100, 250, 500), which would be an interesting extension of your study in 6.2.\n\nComparisons and Experimental Evaluation\n \nAll datasets studied in the comparison methods are based on solutions to synthetic ODE systems, and include several PDEs. The claim that you provided evaluation on real-world datasets I find a little misleading, since none of the benchmarks are based on experimental/real world data, while of course being inspired by real systems.\n\nSelecting comparisons is always a debatable point, but since all benchmark systems chosen are relatively simple/polynomial form, other classes of comparisons could be valuable: approaches by Brunton et al. based on SINDy and its variants are also frequently studies similar fluid flows. Neural Fourier Operators, which you also mention in the related work have been particularly successful for PDEs, so they might be a better choice here.\n \nAlgorithms like ODE-RNN are tailored towards irregularly sampled, but not necessarily spatially extended data. ODE-RNN in general has very poor performance everywhere in the paper (see all figures including ODE-RNN, e.g. Fig 4 or Fig. J6 b), where they seem to have learned nothing meaningful at all, which indicates that there either is a bug in the training, or the method is not well suited as a comparison.\n\nOverall, since I think the general setting studied here is important and the presentation is good, if my concerns can be adressed I am also willing to adjust my final score."

Would it struggle to infer meaningful dynamics from only single or few trajectories, compared to approaches with a stronger inductive bias, such as SINDy (Brunton et al., 2015), or experimental settings, where there are often only single or few observed trajectories. The models in Table H2 have between 1 and 10 million parameters, and are trained on observations with 400 initial states each used for training, which hints at a data and parameter intese regime given some of the relatively simple underlying dynamical processes. How does your model behave for sparser data? Figure 6 indicates that for comparable performance on the pendulum data, comparable performance requires hundreds of observed trajectories?\n\nRelated Work: \n\nI understand that it's hard to provide an exhaustive overview over related methods, and I appreciate the extended related work. I however want to point out that there are many RNN based approaches specifically designed for inferring complex dynamics and leveraging inferred models for long-term time series forecasting (Reservoir Computing, see Pathak et al. 2018), LSTMs (Vlachas et al., 2018) or RNNs (see e.g. Hess et al., ICML 2023), and could be mentioned here as well."

The results demonstrated LaDID's superiority in all experiments, including challenging few-shot learning tasks.\n\nI appreciate the problem tackled by the author and find the concept of invariant-latent representation learning in dynamical systems intriguing. The paper appears to have a solid metric in place. Nevertheless, there are certain crucial aspects that need to be improved. I am open to potentially revising my assessment following the author's rebuttal."

                "value": "**Major comment:**\n\nMy prominent concern in the paper pertains to the insufficient explanation for why their model outperforms others. The main contribution of the paper lacks clear description and justification. As pointed out by the authors, both LaDID and MSVI (Iakovlev et al., 2023) share several similarities, such as using CNN encoders/decoders and the same transformer. The primary distinction between these models lies in replacing neural ODE with MLPs to learn $f_{\\phi_{dyn}}$ and introducing a smoothness loss to discourage abrupt transitions between latent subpatches. It remains unclear how these modifications enhance the process of learning latent dynamics in comparison to ODE-based methods.\n\n**Minor Points:**\n\n- Figure 1 could benefit from a more comprehensive overview of their framework. Clarifying how each process in the top row corresponds to each step in the bottom row would enhance understanding.\n- The paper's writing can be improved, and some content from the Appendix may be integrated into the main text.\n- The descriptions of the experiments are somewhat confusing and could benefit from increased clarity and explanation."

                "value": "- If I understand correctly, the paper addresses only the initial state as the specific (variant) trajectory factor, right? What about other sources of variability, like measurement noise?\n\n- In section 4.1, Model, the main text says *\"To obtain a latent trajectory,  ... we choose as a set of different sine and cosine waves with different wave length.\"* Could you explain it? \n\n- Could you please explain the choice of using MSE/RMSE for evaluation? It seems that capturing the overall structure of dynamics (direction, shape, etc.) might be more crucial than the absolute amount of misprediction.\n\n- Can LaDID effectively handle time-variant dynamical systems? If yes, how?\n\n- In the graphical model (Figure A1), $\\psi^r$ is out of the box \"$N$\". Then, how is $\\psi^r$ a function of \"$n$\" in Eq. 3 and Eq. 9?\n\n- The text mentions *\" ... mean-aggregation, which can be changed based on the task at hand.\"* Could you elaborate on the role and task-dependent nature of mean-aggregation?\n\n- In Eq. 9, within the representation prior term, none of the variables appear to be a function of \"$n$.\" Can you clarify this discrepancy?\n\n- What does \"$D$\" represent in Figure A1?\n\n- The authors stated that *\"our models are specifically designed to exploit certain invariances that are important in classical scientific models.\"* Could you provide more detail on these \"certain invariances\"?\n\n- Beyond classical scientific examples, can LaDID effectively learn developmental trajectories involving bifurcations and other complex phenomena?"
