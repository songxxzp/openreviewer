The authors analyse existing datasets using the tagging method, finding that a higher average number of tags, and higher diversity correlate with good performance, matching prior work examining instruction datasets. They then use the tags as a data selection method (maximising complexity and diversity based on the tags), and find they can train a strong model with as few as 6,000 examples. Finally, they ablate their data selection method and find that increasing diversity and complexity improves performance, while increasing dataset size only improves performance up to a point (around 6,000 examples)."

The method outperforms a random selection baseline and other popular open models such as Vicuna and WizardLM.\n- The analyses of performance against complexity, diversity, and dataset size are useful, providing useful guidelines for future researchers in data collection and selection."

It would be interesting and useful to see how well this method works with openly available models, or over a variety of different quality models (e.g. how does using GPT-4 as a tagger compare? How about Vicuna? etc.).\n- The tag-based analysis is somewhat restrictive, as discussed in section 4.3. It would be interesting to take the semantics of the tags themselves into account somehow, since (a) some tags may be closer to each other and so overlap in terms of diversity, and (b) certain tags may express queries that are naturally more complex than others (e.g. \u2018solve\u2019 vs \u2018inquiry\u2019 tags).\n- MT-bench evaluation involves a relatively small number of questions (80), which may be easier to cover with 6,000 examples. I wonder how well the TagLM model would perform with more questions (e.g. the alpacaEval setting, which has 800 examples), or on more traditional benchmarks such as MMLU, Big Bench, etc. In general, it would be interesting to see if the selection method is biased towards certain capabilities compared to others.\n\nOverall, I think this work is strong, and my main qualm is that the evaluation of the data selection method is somewhat weak, only exploring one evaluation setting. However, the method proposed is interesting and novel, and produces useful insights for data selection in instruction tuning."
