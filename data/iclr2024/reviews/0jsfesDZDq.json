In the SNN, energy consumption is the factor that measure the network efficiency, and not only network sparsity but also spike frequency will also effect it. And due to the variation of spike frequency before and after training, it is almost impossible to predict whether the pruned substructure remains efficient after the training process."

LNP includes four steps 1) random dropout in HRSNN synaptic weights, where dropout rate is determined by the Lyapunov exponent, 2) mask out neurons with the lowest betweenness centrality from HRSNN, 3) add edges to maximize degree heterogeneity within local neighborhoods, 4) a Bayesian optimization for fine-tuning hyperparameter set of neurons.

This vagueness could lead to bias in evaluating the power of the pruning algorithm.\n2. The results on CIFAR-10 display no error bar. Considering that the spectral graph pruning includes a random dropout, the accuracy variance should also be reported.\n3.
