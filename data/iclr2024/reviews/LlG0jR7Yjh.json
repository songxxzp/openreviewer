For each claim (from the fact-checking dataset), an LLM is asked to generate the corresponding references to the claim and predict whether the claim is correct or not. If the LLM\u2019s prediction is not consistent with the ground truth, the generated references are labeled as hallucination. To identify hallucinations, the authors present a two-step procedure: first, they prompt the LLM to generate multiple references in relation to a given claim, and subsequently, the same LLM is used to assess whether any inconsistencies or contradictions exist among the generated references. The presence of such self-contradictions is indicative of the likely hallucinatory nature of the claim."

                "value": "Though this paper is well-motivated, there are three main problems:\n\n* Some designs of the data generation and detection methods are questionable. In detail:\n  1. The method to classify the generated references is unreasonable since the two-phase pipeline brings much noise and accumulates errors. In Step 2, LLMs take the risk of producing wrong answers from factual references and vice versa. \n  2. The problem caused by model randomness in the data generation process has not been considered. For example, for a given (claim, reference) pair, the LLM\u2019s label prediction could be influenced by sampling-based decoding and the form of instructions, as LLMs are sensitive to different instructions (Zhou et al., 2023).\n  3. The necessity of model-specific generation has not been verified. This motivation makes sense, but the authors should also justify it by testing the transferability of datasets generated by different models.\n\n* The proposed pipeline lacks novelty.\n   1. The method of automatically generating hallucinated references was proposed by (Agrawal et al., 2023). The only difference lies in that the authors generated references from existing fact-checking claims instead of topic words.\n   2. The proposed self-contradiction-based hallucination detection method has also been proposed in previous work (M\u00fcndler et al., 2023; Manakul et al., 2023; Cohen et al., 2023), among which M\u00fcndler et al., and Cohen et al., both utilized LLMs as the contradiction judge. Besides, the design of self-contradiction detection in $(Y,Y^{'}_k)$ pair seems meaningless. Since the generation process of $Y$ is the same as that of $Y^{'}_k$, $Y$ can be considered one of $Y^{'}_k$. The claim `*avoid the problem that SelfCheckGPT incorrectly identifies the conflicts in the K sentences generated*' was not verified. \n\n* The experimental settings are not sound enough, making results unconvincing.\n   1. As mentioned above, the quality of generated datasets is not guaranteed, and hence the conclusion is also questionable.\n   2. Some essential baselines are not compared. For example, (M\u00fcndler et al., 2023), which also uses LLMs as the contradiction judge in an NLI manner.\n   3. Since the contradiction judge based on LLMs also introduces randomness and noise, human evaluation is needed for further guarantee.\n\n* Some essential designs need more in-depth analysis. a) Why did self-check perform worse in the few-shot setting than the zero-shot setting with ChatGPT in Table 3? b) Why was 1gm worse than the few-shot with LLaMa2-7B?\n\nRefs:\n* Zhou et al., Large Language Models Are Human-Level Prompt Engineers.
