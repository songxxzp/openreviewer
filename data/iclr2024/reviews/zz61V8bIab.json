However, as the number of domains increases, the count of their private extractors will also rapidly surge.  \nThe author proposed a novel approach Stochastic Adversarial Network (SAN) to avoid the unaffordable explosion of parameters when encountering the newly emerged domains. Specifically, the author modeled the domain-specific feature extractors as a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, some tricks, such as domain label smoothing and robust pseudo-label regularization techniques, are utilized to improve the overall performance.\nExtensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art baselines."

Here is the question: discriminator D may lack of capabilities to recognize the difference among domains as this loss function does not involve any domain knowledge.\nThere may exists another adversarial network in equation (3), i.e. domain-specific extractor enhances the capabilities of discriminator D and domain-invariant extractor still confuse the discriminator D. \n2.\tAs a classic NLP task, this method inevitably needs to be compared with chatgpt. Currently, chatgpt has shown remarkable zero-shot capabilities. Therefore, you need to convince the reviewers why your method should be used instead of chatgpt or highlight the scenarios in which your method has significant advantages."

                "value": "I have some concerns about this work.\n\n1. Assuming the design of proposed model is sensible (in fact I have doubts on this; see 2), the work heuristically puts together a bunch of well-known techniques to improve performance. Works of primarily such a nature, although potentially valuable in practice, do not possess enough novelty that justifies a publication in ICLR. \n\n2. I have doubts on the proposed approach in the \"stochastic\" part. Let us track the parameter $W_1$ of the domain-specific feature extractor for domain 1. In the beginning it is drawn from the prescribed Gaussian, say, its value is $W_1^{(0)}$, and after the first iteration, the Gaussian parameter gets updated (using the reparametrization trick)  -- well, whether Gaussian parameter is updated or not is not critical here. Then in the next iteration, $W_1$  is drawn again, let us call it $W_1^{(1)}$. If this understanding is correct, then $W_1^{(0)}$ and $W_1^{(1)}$ can be very different. That is, along the training process, $W_1$ will randomly hop everywhere as long as the Gaussian variance is not vanishing. How would such a scheme work at all? Bringing the parameter $W_2$ of the second domain-specific extractor into the picture would show an even more absurd picture: at each iteration $t$, $W_1^{(t)}$ and  $W_2^{(t)}$ are random variables following the same Gaussian distribution. How would $W_1$ and $W_2$ track their respective domain specific features?  If this structure were to work, it would have to be the case where the Gaussian variance is very small (which might be the case as shown in Figure 3 of the appendix). In that case, all domain-specific extractors are more or less the same, i.e, all equal to the Gaussian mean, only subject to some tiny *domain-nonspecific* random perturbation. That would defeat the entire purpose of having domain specific feature extractors. -- I could misunderstood the paper and I am willing to hear the authors' defence on this. In your defence, please also show the initial and final values of the Gaussian mean vector $\\mu$ (say, in terms of its L1-norm divided by its dimension), I would like compare it with $\\sigma$."
