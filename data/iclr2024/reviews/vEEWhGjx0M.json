The paper validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack via extensive experiments conducted on various CMAB applications.\n\nClarity: The paper is well-written and presents the concepts, definitions, and analysis in a clear and concise manner.

By introducing the concept of polynomial attackability and providing a comprehensive analysis, the paper contributes to the understanding of the security and robustness of CMAB algorithms. The finding that the attackability of a specific CMAB instance also depends on whether the bandit instance is known or unknown to the adversary is impressive and may have practical implications for designing more secure CMAB systems in real-world applications."

The limitations of the findings are less discussed.\n\nThe findings regard the polynomial attackability highly depends on the threat model, in which the outcome of the base arms can be modified by the adversary. However, recent researchers discussed different types of adversarial attacks on bandit and RL [1-5], including also environment poisoning attack and action poisoning attack. In the CMAB system, the environment-manipulation adversary could manipulate the reward function $r$ and the action-manipulation adversary could manipulate the super arm $S$.\n\nThe proposed sufficient and necessary condition of the polynomial attackability is limited to the specific reward-manipulation adversary. If one environment-manipulation adversary can manipulate the reward function, $\\Delta_M$ could be changed and the condition of the polynomial attackability does not work. Example 4.2 (Hard example) is also limited to the specific reward-manipulation adversary. Some statement in the abstract and introduction is inaccurate. The limitations of the findings are less discussed.\n\nA more thorough discussion about the scope and limitation of the findings would be helpful.\n\n2. Some problems in experimental results.\n\nI found that the numerical experiments do not reflect the effect of the proposed attack algorithm. For example, in (2(g), 2(h)), the number of the target arm pulls is at most 4e3 after 1e5 iterations. The target arm is pulled in only 4% rounds.\n\nIn addition, the experiment that reflects the polynomial unattackablity would be helpful. I recommend that the author can run some experiments on the hard example. The adversary can attack the hard example instance using heuristics with sublinear attack budget.\n\n[1] Amin Rakhsha, Goran Radanovic, Rati Devidze, Xiaojin Zhu, and Adish Singla.
