In order to alleviate the short-sighted reward designs that often lead the agent into undesirable states where the final goal is no longer achievable, the forward-looking reward (FLR) proposed in this paper can enable the agent to evaluate the achievability of the next subgoal upon the completion of the subtask. FLR can be applied to existing hierarchical goal-based reinforcement learning methods, and the results of the corresponding variants obtained in the Mujoco environment show that FLR can improve the performance of the vanilla algorithm."

It is indeed a problem worthy of attention that the intrinsic reward function designed in hierarchical goal-based reinforcement learning is too short-sighted.\n2. The chosen experimental environment is reasonable. If the reward function designed for the agent in the AntMaze3Leg scenario is too short-sighted, it will indeed lead to task failure.\n3. The analysis of the experimental results is sufficient. In the paper, the author gives the number of episodes where the agent falls and the look-ahead reward difference between the normal and fall states when the proposed FLR is applied, which clarify the role of FLR in reinforcement learning to a certain extent."

Especially in AntMaze4Leg, the performance of FLR+DHRL is almost the same as that of the original DHRL.\n2. The experiment was only conducted in two scenarios. I think this is a more empirical paper and should be experimented in more different domains. The current experimental results are not convincing enough.\n3. I think FLR is more about improving the original algorithm capabilities, rather than really giving it the ability to solve short-sighted problems. For example, in AntMaze3Leg, as training progresses, PIG cannot effectively suppress the number of episodes where the agent falls, and neither can FLR+PIG.\n4. The code is not available, which is not conducive to the reproduction of experimental results."

I think the comparison between FLR+DHRL with oracle-based DHRL in Appendix Figure 6 cannot be directly used to illustrate that FLR encourages the avoidance of undesirable transitions. Is the reason the author gives this conclusion because their final winning rates are similar? How about the learning curve for the original DHRL?"

The main idea proposed in this paper is to use a forward-looking reward (FLR) that guides the low-level policy to consider the achievability of the final goal with respect to the current subgoal or state. The FLR is based on a proxy model that estimates the value function of the next subgoal slightly distant from the current one. The paper claims that FLR can improve the performance and sample efficiency of HGRL, especially when the agent starts from unskilled states. The paper also claims that FLR can be easily applied to existing HGRL methods as an extension. Moreover, the empirical analysis on MuJoCo environments shows that FLR outperforms the selected baselines and demonstrates robustness and stability in complex tasks."

Since RL algorithms often perform high-performance variance in different environments/tasks, I think it is necessary to make comparisons with more baselines. And also, I think it would be better if the authors make comparisons on different environments, not only the Maze.\n- Key designs lack of explanation, e.g., how to determine the $sg$ in equation 5? Parameter searching via enumeration, or gradient-based?\n- Missing introduction of environment details\n- The investigation on the effectiveness of $\\alpha$ is not thoroughly, as the authors only test a range of $\\alpha$ when $\\gamma = 0.99$. More trails should be included.\n- The writing is not good enough. For instance, the supplementary should be improved, e.g., there should include some natural language description for the given algorithm tables, and it seems the authors didn't conduct repeated experiments in Figure 6; The paper mentioned FPS algorithm, but what is FPS algorithm? No reference and no introduction; Figure 3 shows the results of \"initial random rollouts\" settings, but there is no description for this setting.\n\nAnd I suggest the authors improving the writing further, especially the details of the involved environments. As you should not suppose your readers are all familiar with the related work of goal-conditioned RL."
