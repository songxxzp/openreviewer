The proposed methodology uses GPT3.5 to summarise patents and extract functional labels, which are then cleaned and disambiguated by embedding them with a different GPT model and summarizing the clusters. The final labels are then mapped to the corresponding chemical structures of the chemicals associated with the patent. The authors create the Chemical Function (CheF) dataset, containing 100k molecules and the derived functional labels. They show that there is a relationship between the extracted labels and chemical structure of the molecules, by converting the molecules to molecular fingerprints and confirming clusters in the structural space correspond to functional labels when projecting with t-SNE. This finding is further validated by performing a similar analysis on the co-occurrence graph of functional labels. The paper also trains a function prediction model on the molecular fingerprints in the CheF dataset and demonstrates its utility qualitatively on a few real-life examples"
