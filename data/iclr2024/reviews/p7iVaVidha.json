Most of the motivation for designing the offline-AC is clearly explained.\n3.

Though the algorithm is well explained, the most crucial part is that the dataset is not well explained. Some details are very critical to judge the quality of this dataset. For example, how many policies did the author use to collect the data? Does this policy train on all datasets? These are the major components of this paper but need to be well discussed."

Could the author give a very detailed description of this part?\n2. In the appendix Figure 4. The comparison seems not convincing. If the advanced MPLight performs very well on the transferred dataset, then the transfer ratio is also low. Could the author provide another metric to evaluate the performance?\n3.

The fact that the proposed offline dataset is publicly accessible is a commendable aspect, as it not only supports the research presented in the paper but also encourages and facilitates further studies and advancements in this area."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "To the best of my understanding, OfflineLight treats each traffic signal as an independent RL agent. Nevertheless, since there are multiple agents, it is crucial to clarify the definitions of state, action, and reward in order to comprehend the problem thoroughly. It would be highly beneficial if there were a well-defined problem formulation, possibly following a POMDP framework. Additionally, I'm interested in gaining a clearer understanding of the objective function. It seems unusual to aim for maximizing the expected reward over historical trajectories when the rewards for these trajectories are already given. Both Offline RL and Online RL generally share a common objective, which is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the expected return within the true MDP. I would appreciate a more detailed elaboration on your objective.\n\nIt's worth noting that OfflineLight does not take into account the interactions between multiple traffic lights. In contrast, many studies in Traffic Signal Control (TSC) have explored such interactions using various techniques like the CTDE framework and graph neural networks. I would like to suggest that integrating these approaches could substantially enhance the performance of the proposed model.\n\nRegarding offline RL, it's important to emphasize the significance of the size and quality of the offline dataset for the algorithm's performance. Unfortunately, there is a lack of analysis regarding the dataset's quality. Providing statistics on the offline dataset, such as the maximum reward contained within it, would greatly enhance the understanding of its characteristics."

Is the state considered a global state or local information for each agent? Additionally, is the reward shared among all agents or individually assigned? This is a critical matter to address, as most RL-based Traffic Signal Control methods operate in a decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework with a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) setting.\n\n2. Offline Dataset Collection Procedure: I'm interested in understanding the specifics of the offline dataset collection procedure. According to appendix B.2, the offline dataset is collected through three epochs of training. However, this may seem insufficient to attain high-reward solutions. Furthermore, I couldn't find information about which RL method is used to generate the dataset for each scenario. Lastly, could you provide some statistics regarding the reward distribution in the dataset, as the quality of the dataset is crucial for Offline RL performance.\n\n3. Experiment Section: Can you provide more details about the training and evaluation procedures in your experiments? I'm particularly curious about how the offline RL models are trained and evaluated in the New York scenario, given that there is no available offline dataset. Please elaborate on this aspect.\n\nI hope you can provide more insight into these questions to better understand your work."
