It certainly makes sense as a procedure for defining new abstractions, but it does not account for intrinsically motivated conjecture-making (guessing a theorem is true and then trying to prove it).\n  - Section 3 misses essential mathematical background to theorem proving. The equivalence of proofs and programs / computation trees is stated and assumed without further comment, but it is not a trivial concept. The Curry-Howard correspondence and how it applies to Metamath deserves more discussion. See or cite, e.g., [P. Wadler, \"Propositions as types\"] for historical overview.\n- Writing unclarities and bugs: \n  - The example in Fig. 1 was hard to make sense of. (Note that the reviewer is familiar with Lean but not Metamath.) Can the last paragraph of section 3 explain it in plain(er) language, explaining what types of objects `ph`, `wffph`, etc. are and what the theorem means?\n  - Incorrect use of \"connected component\" (several times on p.4). It is used to mean \"connected subgraph\", when in fact \"connected component\" has a different and very well-established meaning in graph theory.\n  - Related, please also explain in a few words why connected subtree is not sufficient for validity. Note that issues related to bound variables would only be worse in more sophisticated proof systems -- this could be discussed as a limitation.\n  - Misc.: Please check your citations (`\\citep`/`\\citet`).\n- Evaluations are only on a relatively simple library and there isn't fair comparison to training-free compression schemes for extracting the new theorems.\n- Also see questions below."

Does this affect the experimental claims?\n  - Do you know for certain that the \"human-written\" proofs were written each proof from scratch? How does it affect the claims if humans copied chunks between the proofs?"

The approach described in the symbolic baseline is intuitive and a fair comparison. The result provides confidence that this is an interesting line of work.\n\nI believe the work is meaningful for automated proof simplification and generating better training dataset to improve baseline theorem prover performance. However, I\u2019m concerned whether extracting \u201cnew theorems\u201d from existing proofs is helpful to the automated theorem proving community, or the maths community in general.\n\nGiven that the metamath library is one of the largest databases, it could be possible that the 19.6% is the best possible result for the current REFACTOR pipeline and architecture. Even though 19.6% is a non-trivial result, it would be meaningful if we know whether the results can be improved by expanding the theorems even more and generating more training data."
