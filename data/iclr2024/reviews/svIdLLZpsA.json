This means the proposed loss does not bring anything new for the current diffusion model. \n3. The effectiveness of the proposed MMD loss (Eq. (7)) is doubtful. From Table 2, the performance gain brought by MMD is not significant compared to finetuning only. \n4. The promising performance gains are significantly attributed to the latent prior (Table 2). Given that the latent prior improvement is not introduced by this work but has been already explored by the literature (Section 3.3), the contribution of this work is marginal.\n\nMinor:\n1. $\\epsilon_0$ is not defined in Eq.

The key idea is to frame training data synthesis as matching the joint distribution of data and labels between real and synthetic datasets. This involves two aspects: (1) matching the marginal data distribution, and (2) matching the conditional label distribution given data.\n\nBased on this framework, the authors improve upon the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion model for image synthesis through three strategies: (1) adding an MMD loss to better align feature distributions, (2) incorporating visual cues along with text prompts for conditioned sampling, and (3) using a informative prior for latent diffusion sampling.\n\nExperiments demonstrate improved image classification performance using the proposed synthetic data, outperforming previous methods. Advantages are shown in replacing real data, augmenting real data, scaling up synthetic data, and for OOD generalization and privacy preservation."
