The authors mentioned other RED methods without theoretical guarantees such as [10] [11] [25], but not comparisons are included. Furthermore, the paper only have results on PGD attack. It's not sure if the method can be generalized to other more recent attack types such as AutoAttack. It's also meaning to consider the adaptive attack case."

This paper introduces a framework that assumes clean data resides in the range of a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). To classify signals and attacks, it jointly addresses a GAN inversion problem and a block-sparse recovery problem, offering deterministic linear convergence guarantees, a first in this context. Empirical results on nonlinear datasets show the effectiveness of this approach compared to existing methods."

The objective of RED extends beyond mere defense against attacks; it encompasses the ability to reverse engineer and deduce the specific nature of the attack. The approach deviates from previous assumptions that clean data is contained within linear subspaces, instead utilizing the capabilities of nonlinear deep generative models. The research paper presents a theoretical analysis that demonstrates the achievement of linear convergence towards global optima in the context of the nonconvex inverse problem, subject to certain local error bound conditions. The proposed model's robustness is demonstrated through empirical validations conducted on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets."

A broader array of these methods should be taken into account for a more comprehensive comparison.\n- The evaluation included a comparison of performance in terms of adversarial signal classification accuracy and attack classification accuracy. In addition to assessing robust accuracy, it would be beneficial to extend the comparison to include clean accuracy.\n- The assessment could extend to more sophisticated datasets, like ImageNet, as numerous other State-of-the-Art methods have previously reported their performance on such datasets.\n- To empirically demonstrate the Error Bound, it would be advantageous to present it across a set of samples with varying sizes and illustrate its consistency. If the consistency holds, the maximum/standard deviation should remain nearly constant with an increase in the number of data samples.\n- The effectiveness of GAN inversion falls short compared to the performance achieved with diffusion models, which are commonly employed in current practical applications. Some studies, such as [Nie et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07460), have explored the use of Diffusion Models for purification, resulting in enhanced performance. It might be worthwhile to incorporate these models in this context, considering their potential for estimating clean data.
