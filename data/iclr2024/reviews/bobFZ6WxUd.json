The intuition behind them is also easy to understand.\n3) The experiments are very thorough, verifying not only the improvement in performance but also analyzing whether the label bias issue has been resolved in the analysis section.\n4) This paper is clear and easy-to-follow."

In other words, this paper is not a game changer for NAT. From the experiments, it appears that addressing label bias offers only limited enhancement to DAT's performance. However, this cannot be considered a very strong point of criticism, as I think the authors' perspective of viewing DAT through the lens of HMM to be very useful and improtant."

For instance, I removed the lower triangular mask matrix in DAT, transforming the model into a globally normalized general HMM. However, the model did not converge. If you could contrast this unsuccessful method in your paper, we might gain a deeper understanding of HMM-DAT.\n\nAdditionally, in DAT experiments, glancing training significantly aids DAT. Do you think this training method can be generalized to all HMM algorithms, such as those used in speech recognition, etc.?"

The former adaptively balances the number of outgoing transitions at different latent states. And the latter uses bidirectional components to regularize each other's label bias.\n\nThe experiments are conducted on WMT14 en-de and WMT17 zh-en. Results demonstrate that both proposed strategies can obtain comparable or better performance compared to previous DAT models, and reduce the influence label bias."

                "value": "### Weaknesses\n\n- **[major]**: Despite WMT'14 and WMT'17 being commonly used in the NAT literature, they are now way overhauled in the broader machine translation literature and should be replaced by more recent test sets to put the results into the context of recent research, see **[1]**.\n- **[major]**: NAT papers should follow the broader machine translation standard to report their evaluation scores using `sacrebleu` and provide the corresponding hash that was used for generating the scores. This will ensure that scores are reproducible and do not vary across papers by up to 1.8 BLEU points due to varying tokenization and normalization, see **[2]**, **[4]**. Mixing `sacrebleu` and tokenized BLEU as done in Table 1 shouldn't be done and needs to be fixed.\n- **[major]**: While it is nice to see that the paper attempts to provide GPU benchmarking numbers, the speed multipliers are heavily inflated since the baseline is a non-optimized autoregressive Transformer. There are many de-facto standard ways in practice to construct are more competitive autoregressive inference speed baseline with negligible translation quality drop using e.g. shallow decoders, shortlisting, or quantization (see **[2]**, **[5]**, **[6]**) which should be adopted here.\n- **[major]**: Table 1 doesn't include parameter counts or inference speed numbers which makes it hard to compare the different approaches and understand if the improvement comes from the better algorithm or, simply, the increased parameter count capacity. For example, Bi-HMM uses two different parameter sets to model L2R and R2L and as a result they should have more parameters. Bigger baselines, potentially in parallel branches through e.g. MoE, or scaling up previous approaches might be needed.\n- **[minor]**: It is unclear how well the proposed approach extends to the multilingual setting.\n- **[minor]**: Figure 4 doesn't show a clear trend in the window size, making it hard to extrapolate the findings to other language pairs or datasets without additional analysis for the dataset at hand. This will require additional grid search tuning trials to adopt and no guidance on how to tune this parameter is given.\n\n---\n### References\n\n- **[1]**: [Non-Autoregressive Machine Translation: It\u2019s Not as Fast as it Seems](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.129) (Helcl et al., NAACL 2022)\n- **[2]**: [Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation: A Call for Clarity](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.179) (Schmidt et al., EMNLP 2022)\n- **[3]**: [Results of WMT22 Metrics Shared Task: Stop Using BLEU \u2013 Neural Metrics Are Better and More Robust](https://aclanthology.org/2022.wmt-1.2) (Freitag et al., WMT 2022)\n- **[4]**: [A Call for Clarity in Reporting BLEU Scores](https://aclanthology.org/W18-6319) (Post, WMT 2018)\n- **[5]**: [Findings of the WMT 2022 Shared Task on Efficient Translation](https://aclanthology.org/2022.wmt-1.4) (Heafield et al., WMT 2022)\n- **[6]**: [Edinburgh\u2019s Submission to the WMT 2022 Efficiency Task](https://aclanthology.org/2022.wmt-1.63) (Bogoychev et al., WMT 2022)"
