GenCO combines  the flexibility of deep generative models with the combinatorial efficiency of optimization solvers. This is achieved by introducing a \"combinatorial loss\" in addition to the regular generative loss. The combinatorial loss enforces hard constraints or add penalties for constraint violation. GenCO's involves generating a problem representation $c$. The combinatorial loss $C$ uses a MILP solver to project $c$ onto the feasible set (for hard constraints) or adds a penalty (for soft constraints). For hard constraints, the combinatorial loss is implemented via a projection that finds the closest feasible solution to $c$ allowing training of the generator without explicit constraints as the projection layer handles feasibility. For soft constraints, the combinatorial loss instead adds a penalty term based on constraint violation. The overall loss function balances the generative loss and combinatorial loss with a hyperparameter $\\gamma$. For backpropagation through the combinatorial solver, differentiable MILP solvers are used. Empirical evaluations are presented on game level generation (with hard constraints) and map generation (with soft constraints on path planning efficiency). GenCO consistently generates more diverse and higher quality solutions than baselines."

It is also used in solving combinatorial problems to guide the feasible and quality of solutions. This kind of methods are like the Lagrangian multiplier method, and the idea of modeling the constraints as a loss term is straightforward. There are also many methods targeting on solving combinatorial problems, such as mixed-integer programmings, by generative models, where the combinatorial constraints are also considered. This paper is more like a gatherer of those methods. If I am wrong, the authors may want to further emphasise the technical contribution.\n2. In experiments, the authors report the loss values for evaluation. However, the loss function may not reflect the generation quality precisely, and it is more like a surrogate metric instead of the final goal. Some other metrices for evaluation should be introduced.\n3. Baselines are not strong enough. When considering the specific scenarios such as game design, it is expected to compare the proposed method with the SOTA method tailored for this task, instead of only considering the GAN+MILP baseline, to demonstrate the effectiveness of GenCO.\n4.
