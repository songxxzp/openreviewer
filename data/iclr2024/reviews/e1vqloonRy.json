                "value": "* The authors have mentioned why analyzing the SGD counterpart of the population gradient flow using the drift and martingale decomposition technique can be challenging. Another avenue for obtaining sample complexity is to use full-batch (empirical) gradient flow similar to Bietti et al., 2022 instead of the population version. I'm wondering if the six-stage proof can be adapted to handle such concentration errors and lead to a sample complexity.\n\n* A particularly relevant paper could be [1] where the authors consider learning a single index model with anisotropic Gaussian data, and show that a structure in the covariance can reduce sample/runtime complexity and even remove dependency on the information exponent. I am wondering if similar observations can be made in this paper by introducing additional structure in the inputs. Furthermore, some aspects of the current analysis also appear in [1] due to dealing with anisotropy, such as having to control a quantity of the type $\\Vert f(\\langle Aw, x\\rangle)\\Vert_{L^2}^2$ or preconditioning, which might be interesting to point out.\n\n* The squared Vandermonde density is never explicitly defined in the manuscript. Perhaps providing an explicit definition and recalling some of its relevant properties can help the readers better understand the problem setting.\n\n## Minor Comments:\n* Is the probability in Lemma 4.5 is over the randomness of $(a_m)$? In that case, it might be helpful to point this out in the statement of the lemma.\n* Theorem 4.2 point (iii) asks for $v_0 = 1 - r_0^2$. Could it be more intuitive to introduce this condition as $\\Vert Aw_0 \\Vert = 1$?\n---\n[1] Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini, Denny Wu, Taiji Suzuki, Murat A.

It is shown that gradient flow on some appropriately defined loss function based on a DeepSets student model structure converges to a student model whose parameters are highly correlated with the ground truth, in time that scales logarithmically with the approximation error parameter and exponentially to the (square of the) information exponent associated with the link function, whenever the chosen student model satisfies certain properties. Moreover, an explicit choice of the student model is proposed and precise bounds for the associated convergence rate are provided. The authors also provide experimental demonstration of their results on synthetic data.\n\nThe results in this paper work under a set of modeling assumptions. First, the teacher model is assumed to have a symmetric structure, in the sense that variable relabelling does not change the value of the function. Each of the unknown parameters influences each variable in the exact same way and, in particular, the $k$-th parameter multiplies the sum of all the monomials of degree $k$. Moreover, the link function is assumed to be analytic and supported on monomials of degree at most equal to the square root of the input dimension. Finally, the input distribution is assumed to be the squared Vandermode density, which is shown to enjoy properties in the symmetric setting analogous to those of the Gaussian for a non-symmetric setting.\n\nThe proof techniques used include complex calculus as well as a crucial identity of Vandermode distributions on the symmetric polynomials setting, which motivates establishing Vandermode distributions as the Gaussian analogue in the symmetric polynomials setting."
