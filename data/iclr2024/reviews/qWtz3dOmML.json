However, the results on the ImageNet 512\u00d7512 Benchmark in Table 1 reveal a performance degradation of the proposed method compared to DiT-XL/2-G, along with increased computational resource consumption relative to U-ViT/2-G. Notably, the absence of comparisons with state-of-the-art methods for 512x512 resolution, such as Stable Diffusion, raises questions. To substantiate the claim that the proposed method is suitable for high-resolution generation, additional comparisons at higher resolutions, like 1024x1024, should be included.\n2. It appears that the author has transplanted the network structure from Bidirectional Gated SSM without adequately explaining the task-specific adaptations and improvements. This lack of clarity can be perceived as a limitation in terms of contributions to the research community.\n3. The ablation studies presented a lack of rigor. Table 2 primarily focuses on changes in loss without directly demonstrating the efficiency gains and quality degradation resulting from \"COMPRESSION IN LATENT SPACE.\" This makes it challenging to assess the true effectiveness of this component. Additionally, relying solely on visual representations may be insufficient, especially given the stochastic nature of the diffusion model."

The presence of two DIFFUSSM-XL (or DIFFUSSM-XL(G-1.5)) entries in the ImageNet 256\u00d7256 Benchmark necessitates clarification regarding the distinctions between these two models.\n3.
