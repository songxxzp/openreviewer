                "value": "1. **rst and foremost, I have reservations about using LLM in causal discovery methods:**\n   - Causal discovery aims to recover the causal relations among observational **variables**, not **variable names**. When the causal relations are already known by people (otherwise it couldn't be answered by LLM), there seems to be little need for causal discovery on the data.\n   - Therefore, utilizing LLM to assist in causal discovery, as in this paper to incorporate prior knowledge into the process, appears completely irrelevant to the core of either of LLM or causal discovery. The application of LLM is just another way to obtain the prior knowledge (similar as asking human experts/human-in-loop methods).\n   - However, in terms of causal discovery with prior knowledge, there exists many prior work with solid theoretical foundations (e.g., algorithms, characterizations, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4972.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02997.pdf, https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05067). This paper has none of the theoretical guarantee.\n   - Also, this paper refers to \"LLM supervised causal discovery.\" To clarify, there exists another paradigm of \"supervised causal discovery (SCL)\" (e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00637.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04875.pdf) that employs data supervision to improve statistical estimations with theoretical guarantees. This paper does not belong to that category either and should be termed \"LLM facilitated/assisted causal discovery\" to distinguish it.\n\n2. **There are notable theoretical flaws in this paper:**\n   - As mentioned earlier, the proposed algorithm is just greedy and seemingly intuitive, but lacking theoretical guarantees. For example,\n     + Why does the algorithm apply LLM-answered causal prior knowledge only to score-based algorithm's output of existing edges and not missing edges? Although section 4.1 touches on this, it remains relatively vague and lacks formal proofs.\n     + When LLM answers \"B.changing V2 causes a change in V1,\" why does the algorithm add a direct edge V2->V1 into prior knowledge? It should represent an ancestral relation.\n     + Similarly, when the LLM answers \"C.changes in V1 and in V2 are not correlated.\", why the algorithm only eliminates the direct edges between V1 and V2? It should be all the ancestral relationships got eliminated?\n     + Similarly, when LLM answers \"C.changes in V1 and in V2 are not correlated,\" why does the algorithm only eliminate direct edges between V1 and V2? It should eliminate all ancestral relationships.\n     + The listed three prior constraints: the second one and the path existence one are equivalent, not just a one-way implication. When Xi precedes Xj in every causal ordering consistent with the DAG, Xi must be an ancestor of Xj.\n     + The authors only trigger the LLM query for directed edges predicted by score-based algorithms. However, nonparametric score-based methods typically identify only a PDAG. How do they handle undirected edges, or what parametric assumptions are required if they assume DAGs can be output?\n     + How to demonstrate that the algorithm can terminate (i.e., Line 13 of Algorithm 1, \"until no new constraints are added\")? Furthermore (and more practically), how to identify and resolve conflicts between answers provided by LLM and conflicts within the data distribution?\n   - Overall, I recommend the authors to disentangle this work from LLM and view the proposed algorithm as causal discovery with oracle prior knowledge. They should then evaluate and establish the correctness of the algorithm within the context of causal discovery with prior knowledge."

Also, the need to check whether the LLM is simply regurgitating memorized facts instead of inferring causal structure is discussed (cf. their Tubingen pairs analysis). The second paper gives negative results for inferring causality from data alone using LLMs. Both of these seem relevant to the discussion in this paper.\n\n4.\tI actually recognized the particular way in which the authors suggested for including background knowledge in a CSL search\u2014by updating the priors for the various scorings done in the search based on known edges in the graph. The last time I saw this approach used in a paper was in: Sachs, K., Perez, O., Pe'er, D., Lauffenburger, D. A., & Nolan, G. P. (2005). Causal protein-signaling networks derived from multiparameter single-cell data. Science, 308(5721), 523-529.  So, this also is not a completely novel approach, at least on my reading of it (though please correct me if I\u2019m wrong).\n\n5.\tThere are other ways to include background knowledge in a CSL search, as implemented, for instance, in the PCALG package or in the Tetrad package\u2014where particular edges can be identified as forbidden or required in a search with rules applied for updating the graph structure given these constraints. A mention of this methodology might have proven useful, or better yet, a comparison to this approach. I don\u2019t know how to incorporate knowledge of required or forbidden paths (longer than a single edge) using that technology though.\n\n6.\tMinor point.

We strongly recommend the authors to learn and adopt the strict math language from Causality Inference and Graph Theory. Such an effort is worthy for better presentation of your contributions.\n\n4. It is hard for us to understand why a general LLM model could always help to enhance the causality performance rather than deteriorate. We understand that it is most likely difficult to prove it in math. That's why we have to refer to your strict presentation of your method in math and your discussions of its properties to understand this point. It sounds reasonable if the LLM used in a particular CSL task has learned of the domain knowledge of that task. The LLM helps to contribute positively like an human expert for the task. However, in your experiments, it seems you are using a general LLM without fine-tuning; thus, why such a LLM helps to contribute positively to tasks from various fields, rather than behaves like a \"layperson\" to offer wrong prior information to misguide the whole CSL task."

Different from previous approaches which utilize the pairwise ancestral information, ILS-CSL uses the data driven approach as driving force to let LLM decide the edge existence. The decided edge existences are used as either soft/hard constraint to feedback to data driven approach iteratively.\nBy doing so, the paper shows the reduction of error counts produced by LLM, and ILS-CSL consistently improves the accuracy of CSL in 8 datasets from bnlearn repository."

The targeted problem is valid and important, timely\nSince the year 2023, there has been more evidence that LLM has a sort of commonsense causal knowledge, and it is very important to consider leveraging its power to enhance data-driven CSL for causal discovery.\n\n2. The idea of using the data-driven approach as a driving force to let LLM decide the edge existence.\nI appreciate the efforts on combining the both in a smart way. commonly. This idea is novel and its effectiveness is demonstrated.\n\n3. The paper is well written. Section 4 (Analysis of important concerns) is also interesting in showing semi-quantitative comparison between this approach vs. ancestral estimation approach"

This seems to suggest that, the ILS-CSL has significant improvement when the baselines are weak?\n\n2) dealing with the situations when the data driven approach give near empty graph\nAlgorithm 1 shows that if the LLM would  not help when the data driven approach outputs an empty graph. We know that there are hyper-parameters that would balance between FP and FN, so in some setting, the algorithm would tent to be conservative to produce edges. I wonder authors opinion on this.\n\n3) The method  seems can be extend to deal with continuous data naturally,  why not conduct such experiment?\n\n4) In Section 4.2 ESTIMATION OF PRIOR ERROR COUNTS,\na) the number of pairwise nodes devoid of paths is \\gamma N(N-1)/2, but these paths does not only have X-...->Y or Y-...->X, but the paths with forks. these cases do not fall into the \"Extra Causality\", so the E_full is an upperbound?\n\nb) also, I wonder how the ratio:=E_ours/E_full change when the performance of baseline data-driven method goes? e.g., if the baseline goes better, how will the ratio change?"
