The problem in doing so is how to obtain a valid notion of posterior, given that the likelihood function is typically unknown and only available through simulation.\n\nThe authors propose a notion of a posterior in this setting and prove that it arises as a solution to a generalized variational inference problem. In particular, they connect the simulation data to the observed (real) data through a \"loss\" function which computes the 2-Wasserstein distance between their respective persistence diagrams. \n\nExperiments show that the proposed method is accurate for various scientific applications, such as simulation-based inverse problems."

                "value": "My main issue with this paper is several-fold.\n\nFirst, the experiments are lacking baselines. The authors provide two kinds of data: point clouds and greyscale images. By themselves, they are independent of computational topology/geometry and Bayesian inference, and thus, there must be some recent non-topological, non-Bayesian baselines out there that the authors can compare against. (I have to admit that I'm not well-versed in this particular area.) Moreover, the authors should discuss and compare the cost of their method to those baselines. In its current form, it is very hard to judge the soundness of the results.\n\nSecond, one of the main selling points of Bayesian inference is the uncertainty associated with the estimate. However, the authors don't seem to explore this---they only show accuracy. Since the form of the posterior considered in this paper is rather non-standard, I think it is important to empirically study its uncertainty calibration. Moreover, I do think uncertainty can be very useful in many simulation tasks, so I urge the authors to try to find applications that cannot be done without uncertainty, in the settings considered in this paper. (E.g., uncertainty in Bayesian neural networks opens up avenues in tasks such as weight pruning, sequential decision making, etc.) This will boost the strength of the paper significantly.\n\nThird, I think the paper's presentation needs to be improved. Sec. 2, for example, is quite dense and might put non-topology people off. The figures can also be improved, e.g. Fig. 1 is very unclear, Fig. 2 is hard to see (in print, at least), and Fig. 3's line width is too thin.\n\n\n## Minor stuffs\n\nAfter reading the paper, I'm not sure how to implement the proposed method---an algorithm about the whole method is much preferable to Alg. 1 which only shows a standard importance sampling algorithm."

In your proof, your strategy is to show that (5) arises in the KL-divergence with $q$, and hence you can conclude that (5) is the solution to the variational problem (8).\n\nHowever, one of the standard ways of deriving the ELBO (i.e. the objective of the form of (8)) is via the KL-divergence itself. So, I can define any other arbitrary distribution in the form of (5) and can prove that it is a \"valid posterior\" by following your proof idea. So, to me Prop. 3.1 seems to suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem, and thus I'm not sure about its validity. \n\nCan the authors please clarify this?"

The framework of generalized Bayesian posterior uses a distribution over parameters together with a generic loss function and provides theoretical guarantees for the existence of appropriate posterior beliefs about the parameter. In this paper, since building likelihood models that connect the parameters directly to observations seems to be a challenging task the authors propose to use an auxiliary generative model that connects the parameters to a variable $x$ and define the loss based on the similarity of the sampled (or simulated) $x$ to the observed data $y$. In this model, the (generalized) posterior over the parameter can be obtained by marginalizing out the variable $x$. The authors use multiple loss functions including Wasserstein and Hausdorff losses and provide importance sampling and MCMC algorithms for the inference of the parameters. Results are shown on synthetic datasets in the context of swarm behavior, fluid dynamics, percolation, and inference of radii of a sphere or torus."

Although the authors motivate the method by quantifying uncertainty in applications where building a generative model is intractable, almost every application shown in the paper follows a clear generative process.\n\nThe presented applications are very unclear. Can the authors elaborate on what the $x$ is in each setting and what prevents us from running a gradient-based algorithm (such as a neural network) to solve the inverse problem and estimate the associated $\\theta$? The main argument of the paper is that for these applications we can't simply solve the inverse problem using gradient-based methods but it's not clear to me what's the main obstacle. This has caused some confusion for me about applying generalized Bayesian posteriors in this context. To get error bounds on the parameters a variety of methods are introduced. For neural networks, one can use conformal prediction strategies or simply apply other frequentist techniques such as Bootstrap.\n\nThe experimental part of the paper is weak in its current form. No comparisons are presented against alternatives. Perhaps the presented method is not the only way of performing these types of analyses. A discussion of the alternative approaches should be included in the introduction and used for comparisons in the results section.\n\nGeneralized Bayesian posteriors existed before, the extension presented in the paper is rather elementary. In addition, the losses used in the paper all existed before. Furthermore, the inference algorithms presented in the paper are standard algorithms. The contributions seem to lie in bringing the generalized Bayesian posteriors to the TDA world and showing its application in the presented settings. Given that the results and comparisons are relatively weak and the motivation is unclear I'm leading towards a negative rating for this paper."

MCMC and importance sampling both take a long time to converge (compared to optimization-based inference strategies). What are the conditions in which one should use this method as opposed to alternatives?\n\nCan you include a clearer description of the generative model, the prior model for $\\theta$, the likelihood model for $x$, and the loss for each application presented in the results section?

This is plug-n-play, and I am not sure if this is novel enough. There are a few reasons to reject this paper:\n\n1)\tNovelty --- Like I said the paper is simply proposing to plug in topological losses into a sampling loss function. The paper discusses some experiments to show its importance e.g. Fig 2 is interesting. \n2)\tLimited empirical results \u2013 The empirical results are all based around the fact that plugging in topological loss is better than plugging in the geometrical loss. This is useful to know in general. These results are not suprising, better losses would give better estimations. There are only a few empirical settings explored. \n\nMinor: There a re a couple of places where the writing could be improved. I would suggest the authors make their contributions explicit in the intro section. The tangentially relevant material about sampling from the loss function could be expanded but moved from to the appendix. I would suggest the authors expand on their contributions to make the paper stronger. \n\nThe authors mention that pseudo-marginal MCMC algorithms can sample from (6) even when p(x|\\theta) may not support automatic differentiation. Can they please expand on this? It is not clear how this could happen? I understand this could be available in Andrieu & Roberts 2009 but it would be nice to expand on it in this paper itself for completeness. \n\nThere are a few typos that require a bit more thorough reading. E.g. Eq (8) it should be p(\\theta) instead of \\pi(\\theta). Similarly Eq (12) there seems to be a typo. Typos in English make the paper hard to read but typos in equations just break the paper."
