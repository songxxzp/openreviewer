The results on CASP14 and CASP15 benchmarks demonstrate significant enhancements in the Local Distance Difference Test (LDDT) scores, particularly for difficult sequences.

While their approach shows promise, it is crucial to provide a more comprehensive perspective and clarify the novelty of their contribution. Unfortunately, the manuscript overlooks several pertinent references, including:\n1. McGee, F., Hauri, S., Novinger, Q. et al. The generative capacity of probabilistic protein sequence models. Nat Commun 12, 6302 (2021).\n2. Riesselman, A.J., Ingraham, J.B. & Marks, D.S. Deep generative models of genetic variation capture the effects of mutations. Nat Methods 15, 816\u2013822 (2018).\n3. Sinai, S., Kelsic, E., Church, G. M. & Nowak, M. A. Variational auto-encoding of protein sequences. NeurIPS 2017 MLCB Workshop\n\nOnce a distribution for a specific MSA is acquired through learning, sampling from this distribution becomes an efficient method for generating multiple protein sequences that share similarities. \n\n---\n\nExamining Figure 4a, it's not immediately clear whether the depth or quality of the MSA holds more significance. For example, if we were to introduce random protein sequences into the MSA, we are uncertain how this would impact performance. This calls for a more in-depth analysis to understand the relationship between MSA depth and quality and their potential trade-offs in achieving optimal results. As an example, if we were to introduce random protein sequences by masking certain sequences within the original MSA, can we also achieve good performance? \n\n---\n\nMy primary concerns arise when I examine Figure 7. I'm curious about the methodology behind calculating the conservation and quality metric. It seems that these scores are derived solely from the provided sequences, such as the six sequences for T1093-D1. Consequently, I question the significance of these metrics. \n\nOne could argue that it's possible to achieve high scores for conservation, quality, or other metrics by simply inspecting the original MSA, identifying the region with the highest conservation metric, and selecting it as a segment. This segment could then be augmented by inserting arbitrary amino acids at random positions occasionally. Such a process could potentially yield perfect conservation scores, quality scores, and so on.\n\nThis concern also ties into my second question: What would the pLDDT score be if I were to employ the aforementioned approach to augment the original MSA?\n\n---\n\n\nIn Section 4.5, the authors make a comparison with Iterative Unmask; however, they do not provide a comparison of the pLDDT scores using this baseline method. Additionally, there is some ambiguity regarding the dataset used for the analysis. It remains unclear which sets of sequences were used by the authors to construct the Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) and what the correlation coefficients are when employing Iterative Unmask."

The paper validates the efficacy of the MSAGenerator using the CASP14 and CASP15 benchmarks, indicating notable improvements in LDDT scores.

The reasons for this choice are not explained, and it raises questions about the potential variation in results had UniRef50 been employed for both stages.\n\n- The introduction of an \"artificial challenging MSA\" requires a more comprehensive explanation. Its significance and the rationale behind its inclusion in the study are unclear. Figure 4 a seems to depict an imbalanced comparison. If homologous sequences were present during the pretraining phase but not considered for the baseline, it would be an unfair representation. This suggests that the MSAGenerator's performance may not surpass real MSAs.\n- For Figure 4c, it is crucial to also represent the \"Real over Virtual\" comparison to provide a comprehensive view(negative interval)\n- Fig4 Queries arise regarding the consistency of the reported improvements when other protein structure prediction methods, like RoseTTAFold, are used.\n- In Table 1, the specific MSA methodology employed in the benchmarking process, as well as the precise parameters and databases used for MSA searches, are not detailed.
