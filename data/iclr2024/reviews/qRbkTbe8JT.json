What is the reason behind this emphasis without providing much evidence to support it?\n\n2. It is important to study the effect of \\alph, \\beta, and \\lambda on the performance. How the user should tune them? A study should be offered for this purpose. If the performance is sensitive with respect to the values of these hyperparameters, then it is essential to provide a solution for selecting the optimal values.\n\n3. There are other common settings to study CL using CIFAR100, e.g., using 20 tasks each with 5 classes. I think adding experiments for these settings is also helpful to demonstrate how well the method scales when there are more tasks.\n\n4. Having learning curves in CL is common and allows for studying the dynamic of learning. I think providing them in addition to the tables is helpful."

The motivation behind the approach stems from the fact that contrastive embeddings lie on the hypersphere, which improves training stability and classification performance.
