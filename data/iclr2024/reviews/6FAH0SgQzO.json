It pointed out that the clusters with concept shifts might not learn a common decision boundary, and existing clustered FL approaches failed in handling the concept shifts. This paper then proposed a novel FedRC with concept shift aware objective function. Experiments demonstrated that FedRC achieved better performance than clustered FL baselines in various data sets.\n\n**Quality:** The motivating example in Figures 3&4 clearly illustrated the principles of robust clustering in handling concept shifts. Then the principles of robust clustering also guided the design of the objective function in Eq. (1). The clients with concept shifts were expected to clustered in different groups. The experiments verified the effectiveness of FedRC with respect to local and global generalization performance.\n\n**Clarity:** The motivation of this paper is clear. Different from feature or label shift, concept shift essentially affects the clustering structure. The objective function in Eq. (1) aims to avoid generating clusters with concept shifts. Experiments show that the proposed FedRC significantly outperforms existing clustered FL methods.\n\n**Significance:** The problem studied in this paper is practical but challenging. In real scenarios, different types of distribution shifts occur simultaneously among clients. As a result, adaptively generating clusters based on the types of distribution shifts can be applied to solve real-world federated learning problems."

                "value": "**W1:** The impact of feature and label shifts on clustering can be further explained. The goal of the proposed clustered method is to separate clients with concept shifts into different clusters. It might consider clients with feature and label shifts into a single cluster. Thus, the clustering quality can also be affected by the feature and label shifts. For example, a single model might fail to hand clients with large label shifts.\n\n**W2:** The optimization of Eq. (2) is unclear. \n- Firstly, the definition of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{I}}(\\mathbf{x}, y; \\theta_k)$ is confusing. It is defined over the weights $\\gamma_{i,j; k}$, but $\\gamma_{i,j; k}$ is also defined over $\\tilde{\\mathcal{I}}(\\mathbf{x}, y; \\theta_k)$ in Eq. (4). \n- Secondly, the updating in Eqs. (4)(5) are not associated with $\\lambda_i$ in Eq. (2). Then how would the second term of Eq. (2) affect the optimization?\n\n**W3:** The convergence of FedRC is not provided. Theorem 4.3 shows the convergence of the centralized version of FedRC. Can it also hold for federated learning scenarios?\n\n**W4:** Step 2 in Algorithm 1 is not explained. It is unclear why checking and removing models are necessary for FedRC during training."

It shows that existing approaches, e.g., FeSEM, IFCA, are not robust to feature and label shifts. But it is confusing how these observations are indicated in Figure 3.\n\n**Q3:** Does FedRC in Algorithm 1 update $\\gamma_{i,j; k}, w_{i; k}$ once and $\\theta_{i; k}$ for $\\Gamma$ local steps?\n\n**Q4:** How are the models of nonparticipating clients generated during testing in the experiments?\n\n**Q5:** Figure 6(d) shows that FedRC outperforms FedAvg and retains robustness when there is only one concept. When there is only one concept, would FedRC exactly recover FedAvg?\n\n**Q6:** Figure 6(c) shows that FedRC with hard clustering consistently outperforms that with soft clustering. Besides, hard clustering can better satisfy the principles of robust clustering by separating clients with concept shifts into different clusters. In this case, It is confusing why not simply apply hard clustering when optimizing FedRC."
