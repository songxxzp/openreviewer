The proposed method has requirements on the detector's performance (mAP>15%) on target data. However, in real-world scenarios, we cannot be certain if the detector performs well enough to meet this requirement. We don't know how reliable is the BoS score. Can BoS be used to  improve the detection results?\n\n2. Another issue is that the evaluation of BoS is primarily focused on single-class scenarios, and it does not perform as well in multi-class settings. In real-world applications, we often encounter multiple bounding boxes detected across different classes. Consequently, the accuracy of matching between the original prediction and the prediction after feature perturbation may be compromised. It remains uncertain whether the performance of BoS will degrade when dealing with multi-class data.\n\n3. Additionally, the length of this paper exceeds the 9-page limit."

                "value": "1. In Table 3, under the multi-class detection setting on Cityscapes and Self-driving datasets, the BoS performs much worse than other methods on car. While under single class setting, the RMSE of BoS of car on Cityscapes is 0.89, which is much better than others.There is no explaination on this point. Does the proposed method unstable in multi-class setting?\n\n2. In each table, does the number besides the dataset or class name reports the real mAP? For example, COCO (34.2) in Table 1. If so, in Table 2, on Kitti and CityPersons datasets, the mAP is 13.3 and 11.8 respectively, which are lower than the requirement (mAP > 15%)."
