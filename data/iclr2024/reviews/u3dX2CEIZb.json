                "value": "Major: As claimed by the authors in the last paragraph in page 4, the utilizing of Mixture-of-Experts is motivated by two reasons/challenges. (A) In complicated systems, compared with global physical constraints, local constraints are more manageable. (B) The scalability of the non-linear least squares solver impeded the increase in the number of sample points (m), thereby affecting the accuracy of predictions. \n\nReason A aligns with the phenomenon we have observed in language tasks [1]: data from different domains can interfere with each other and hinder training. However, the authors did not provide evidence for the occurrence of this phenomenon in dynamic systems, nor did they demonstrate that the improvement of the PI-HC-MoE over PI-HC is due to avoiding such interference. One possible experiment to demonstrate the latter is to randomly assign data points to experts and compare it to the allocation based on spatio-temporal coordinates.\n\nChallenge B can be overcome by utilizing MoE. However, a more straightforward solution will be employing scalable non-linear least squares solvers, e.g. [2][3]. The authors didn\u2019t comment on this line of works. If there are suitable solvers available, I would like to see a comparison between PI-HC and PI-HC-MoE with the same number of data points.\n\nFurthermore, the performance of the baseline appears to be inconsistent with the results reported in [4], e.g., 1D non-linear diffusion-sorption equation results, see [4], Appendix E.\n\nMinor: There are several errors and confusions in the use of mathematical symbols in the text, including but not limited to \n(1) in section 3, first paragraph, line 1, $0$ should be in bold.\n(2) in section 3, first paragraph, line 4, the definition of $\\mathcal{G}$ and in the second paragraph, line 4, the definition of $f_{\\theta}$, other notation should be used to denote the spaces of $\\phi$, $u_\\theta$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\n(3) In section 3, second paragraph, line 5, $f^i: \\phi \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ should be $f^i: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\n(4) In section 3, second paragraph, third to last line, $f_\\theta(\\phi(x))$ should be $f_\\theta(\\phi)(x)$.\n(5) In page 4, two lines above Property (1), the definition of $S_{\\mathbf{b}}$ and $S_\\omega$.\n\nSimilar errors are repeated throughout the paper and should be corrected.\n\n[1] Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer\n[2] Scalable Subspace Methods for Derivative-Free Nonlinear Least-Squares Optimization\n[3] DeepLM: Large-scale Nonlinear Least Squares on Deep Learning Frameworks using Stochastic Domain Decomposition\n[4] PDEBENCH: An Extensive Benchmark for Scientific Machine Learning"

The authors believe that when training neural networks, using well-known physical rules, like conservation laws, can enhance results and speed up learning processes. But, there's a drawback: this method can take up a lot of computing power and storage, especially with big systems.\n\nTo solve this, the authors suggest using MoE. Here, the data is split into sections, with each section having an \"expert\" to apply the rules. Every expert works on a specific part of the data, and a special network decides how much importance to give each expert's output. This method saves on computing power and storage but still gives accurate results.\n\nThey test their method on various physical problems, such as fluid movement and quantum mechanics. They compare their results with other top methods and find their method is just as good, if not better, and uses less resources. Plus, it can handle big systems. In conclusion, the paper offers a fresh and effective way to use MoE to apply strict physical rules, which could make neural networks better and faster at solving complex systems."

The paper proposes a framework that decomposes the domain $\\Omega$ into subdomains $\\Omega_k$ before solving the NLSS problem on each subdomain.\n\nThey tested the framework as a neural PDE solver on 1D diffusion-sorption and turbulent 2D Navier-Stokes equations in a data-constrained regime.

                "value": "This paper proposes a scalable way to enforce hard constraints expressed as partial differential equations into neural networks in order to faithfully model physical phenomena. The problem they try to tackle is given by the fact that backpropagating through constraints over large meshes is a highly non-linear problem that grows in dimensionality with respect to the mesh and neural network size. The authors propose to impose the constraints over smaller decomposed domains, each of which is solved by an expert."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**Clarity:** \n \nThe paper is mostly quite clear. Personally, I would have benefitted from an ongoing example, where it is made clear what the outputs of the neural networks are, what the constraints are, and how the problem is divided in that case. Even better, it would have been nice to use the same example to move from one constraint to multiple ones."

                "value": "**Experimental Analysis:**\n\nThe experimental analysis seems quite comprehensive. My main question is: are PI-SC and PI-HC the only models against which you can compare? \n\nAlso, the authors compare the execution time of PI-HC vs PI-HC-MoE, what about PI-SC?\n\nI am not sure I understand the scales in Figure 3. If the row below represents the difference between the predictions made by the NN and the prediction made by the numerical solver, how is it possible to have a scale between -3 and 3? \n\nThe authors compare their method against PI-HC and PI-SC in terms of computation time, what about space? Is the memory requirement of PI-SC-MoE also advantageous and/or comparable?"
