(7)) and the regularization term (Eq. (9)). In common cases, minimizing the regularization term will make the original objective larger. In this paper, the original objective cares more about higher decimals, while the regularization treats all decimals equally. Thus, adding the regularization term will inevitably sacrifice the accuracy of higher decimals, which hurts the original objective. To my understanding, the original objective already reflects the precision requirement when approximating chaotic systems, and the regularization term only plays a negative role."

After the abbreviation appears for the first time, it would be better to use the abbreviation rather than the full name.\n3. On the 2nd line in the introduction, the citation is of the form \"Name (year)\". But the name is not a part of the sentence, thus it would be better to use the form \"(Name, year)\".\n4. Above Eq. (1), \"it's\" should be \"its\".\n5. The first paragraph in the introduction is too long (more than 1 page), and readers may lose the central idea easily. It would be better to separate it into several paragraphs.\n6. Below Eq. (2), \"maybe\" should be \"may be\".\n7. Significant digits or significant bits are not defined.\n8.

The authors are motivated by chaotic systems, where slightly-inaccurate predictions can diverge quickly from the ground truth. In particular, the authors propose to output each binary bit of a traditional LNN's output, and they introduce several new regularization terms to supplement the regular LNN objective towards the goal of higher binary precision. The authors test their proposed model on the double pendulum and Henon-Heiles chaotic systems, with improvements over the original LNN architecture in the amount of steps before the predictions of each chaotic system's state diverges from the truth."

However, the authors design a training policy that carefully considers possible issues during training (such as the increasing $\\mu_{TC}$ scale term and the proposed regularization term), which is appreciated. \n\nFor instance, $O_{reg}$ is used to supplement, not replace, the $O_{pred}$ MSE loss, and $O_{TC}$ is a good heuristic to deal with the situation in which the Lagrangian of a given system does not have a known analytical form. The increase weight of $\\mu_{TC}$ is also a good solution to reduce instability from the initial transient stages of training.\n\nThe authors also compare between various choices of the precision parameter $k$, and they empirically show that the results of using low $k$ values are similar to the results of the original LNN model, which is an interesting result."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There is little to no explanation, intuition, or motivation about why this method should be superior to standard regression techniques optimizing with mean squared error. In general, there are several methodological concerns I have. For instance, computing the explicit Lagrangian using eq. 8 and comparing it with the ground truth MSE loss seems equivalent to the standard LNN formulation. Thus, the novelty of this method is in the regularization term $O_{reg}$ and in the regularization method to deal with unknown Lagrangians for the underlying system. Can the authors provide some intuition for why $O_{reg}$ is added and why it improves performance? Also, in what sense does $O_{reg}$ provide a regularization effect?\n\nThere is also no discussion and comparison to prior variants of LNNs. One such paper is Finzi et al., 2020, which also performs experiments on the double pendulum. I would strongly recommend the authors perform numerical experiments to compare against other prior LNN variants, not just the original LNN model. Furthermore, there is little to no discussion in the introduction about these LNN variants. At the very least, I would like to see some discussion about prior improvements to the LNN/Hamiltonian neural network (HNN) architectures.\n\nFurthermore, the evaluation for this method seems a bit limited. Recent extensions of LNNs and HNNs target more difficult problems, such as 5-pendulums (Finzi et al., 2020) and pendulums with friction (Zhong et al., 2021). Given these prior works, I would also strongly recommend the authors add more challenging case studies (e.g., any of the ones mentioned earlier) and compare to prior methods.\n\nIn summary, if the authors wish to convince the readers of the novelty and contribution of their work, I would recommend adding a deeper explanation and intuition for this method, adding more difficult test cases, and adding comparisons with other LNN variants (not just the baseline paper).\n\n**References:** \n* Finzi, M., Wang, K.
