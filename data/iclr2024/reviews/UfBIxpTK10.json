The testing binding pockets are ensured to have a different shape than those in the training dataset. The ML-based docking methods fail in this benchmark, so a new training strategy is proposed to improve the results of the diffusion-based models.

                "value": "- The mathematical formulas in the paper should be corrected. Some parentheses are missing, and there are some symbols that were not introduced in the text, e.g. $p_{0t}$. I understand that the equation in Section 4.1 should correspond to the equation introduced in the cited publication (Song et al., 2021), but the new undefined symbols and missing parentheses make this equation hardly readable.\n- In Table 1, the results of DiffDock with modification explained in Section 4.4 and without dataset extension should also be presented.\n- In this benchmark, the only evaluation metric (besides computation time) is the percentage of the poses with RMSD below 2 or 5 A. Given the recent criticism of ML-based docking models, it would be advised to include conformation quality metrics like those proposed in PoseBusters [1].\n- It would be interesting to quantify the similarity between the binding pockets used in training, fine-tuning, and testing. I am curious if using complexes from the same dataset for fine-tuning and testing could create biases in the data due to the way the data is preprocessed and filtered. Furthermore, you should also try fine-tuning using only PDBBind structures, and see if the results for the DockGen benchmark improve in this setup.\n\n[1] Buttenschoen, M., Morris, G. M., & Deane, C. M. (2023). PoseBusters: AI-based docking methods fail to generate physically valid poses or generalise to novel sequences. arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.05777.\n\nBefore this paper can be published, it is essential to clarify the mathematical formulation of the method. Furthermore, additional results that disentangle the three new factors (architectural changes, dataset expansion, and confidence bootstrapping) would not only increase the credibility of the findings but also enhance the overall quality of the paper. I am willing to increase my score if my comments are properly addressed by the Authors.\n\n-----------\nEdit: I changed my score (5 -> 6) after reading the other reviews and Authors' responses. The paper was significantly improved. Most of my concerns were resolved, and it seems the remaining concerns can be resolved in the final version of the manuscript if the running experiments are finished."

                "value": "1. Why have you decided to call your method Confidence Bootstrapping? This setup does not remind me of the classical bootstrapping method. The sampling is done from the continuous distribution (not a discrete distribution with replacement), and each sample is processed independently (not resampled as a subset of the population sample). Why is this method not called, e.g., Confidence Sampling?\n2. What do you think about including conformation quality metrics in the benchmark, like those proposed in PoseBusters? Do you think that self-training using the confidence model can impact the pose quality in any significant way?\n3. Based on the description in the paper, I was not sure which dataset was used for fine-tuning. I checked in the code, and `DistillationDataset` uses the Binding MOAD data. Could you confirm that?
