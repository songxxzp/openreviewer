In the experiment in Figure 4, CRLA achieves performance beyond fixed length on only about half of the tasks. This may be not enough to support the effectiveness and significance of CRLA.\n3.

                "value": "1. Whether in state-based model-based RL or visual-based model-based RL, linearly increasing the rollout horizon with the increase in environment steps has already become a standard practice (MBPO [1], TDMPC [2]). This is not as the paper claims in the abstract, ''To prevent significant deviations between imagined rollouts and real transitions, most model-based methods manually tune a fixed rollout length for the entire training process.'' Therefore, I believe the paper should provide experimental results and analysis on DreamerV3 with a linearly adjusted rollout horizon. If the performance is good, I don't see the necessity of dynamically adjusting the rollout horizon since this requires training a conservator, which will bring additional time and computational resource consumption.\n\n2. In state-based MBRL, there are already many methods that have attempted to address the issue of model compounding error caused by an overly long rollout horizon. These methods can be directly applied to visual-based MBRL, such as discarding samples with excessively large errors (M2AC [3]) and learning a world model that is more accurate for the current policy (PDML [4]). I believe these should all be baselines for this paper, yet the paper only provides the original results from DreamerV3.\n\n3. One advantage of the latent world model is that there is no need to explicitly predict the next observation. Instead, transitions are performed in the latent space, which to some extent avoids model error. In the abstract, this paper claims, \"While longer rollout length offers enhanced efficiency, it introduces more unrealistic data due to compounding error, potentially leading to catastrophic performance deterioration.\" However, no references are cited, and no experimental evidence is provided. This weakens the motivation of the paper.\n\n4. The method proposed in this paper can only be used in discrete action environments (Atari) and is not applicable to continuous control tasks, which significantly limits the practicality of the method.\n\n5. Based on Figure 7, the method proposed in this paper does not show significant performance improvement, and in many environments, it even harms performance.\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Janner et. al. \"When to Trust Your Model: Model-Based Policy Optimization,\" in NeurIPS 2019\n\n[2] Hansen et. al. \"Temporal Difference Learning for Model Predictive Control,\" in ICML 2022\n\n[3] Pan et. al. \"Trust the Model When It Is Confident: Masked Model-based Actor-Critic,\" in NeurIPS 2020\n\n[4] Wang et. al. \"Live in the Moment: Learning Dynamics Model Adapted to Evolving Policy,\" in ICML 2023"

                "value": "1. I am very curious whether, in the latent space, there will indeed be unrealistic samples due to long rollouts that affect policy performance, just as in state-based MBRL methods. Based on this question, I also doubt whether the theoretical analysis from MBPO in Section 3.3 can be used to analyze DreamerV3.\n2. Why does the rollout horizon in Figure 4 start long at the beginning of training and become shorter as training progresses? This is counter-intuitive. In the early stages of training, when the model is not very accurate, it should use short horizon rollouts. As the model learning progresses and becomes more accurate, the rollout horizon should gradually lengthen. I hope the paper can provide a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon.\n3. Why does the performance curve for DreamerV3 only have 5 seeds, while the method proposed in this paper has 10 seeds? I believe this is not reasonable. Additionally, in Figures 4 and 7, the horizontal axis scales for DreamerV3 and the proposed method are not aligned, which can also influence the performance comparison.\n4. Introducing the conservator will lead to additional training overhead. Can the paper provide a comparison of training time with Dreamer V3?"

Despite being conceptually straightforward, the method requires running a complete rollout up to the maximum length before any truncation occurs.
