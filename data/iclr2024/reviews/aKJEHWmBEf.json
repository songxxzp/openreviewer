In the following paragraphs, I listed some of the things that were unclear to me, maybe I did not fully understand these parts, and some points on how to improve the evaluation of the paper:\n\n- It was not clear to me the statements at the end of section 2.3. How $\\sigma \\rightarrow 0$ makes $\\lambda (Q^{pred}) \\rightarrow \\lambda (Q^{simple})$ ? There is no control over the features that come out from the previous layers and the clustering obtained can be worse than $Q^{simple}$ as defined later in the paper, farthest point sampling with KNN. I suppose here $Q^{simple}$ refers to the random uniform partition and not the Voronoi partition used later. If this is true, later I would not refer to the Voronoi partition as $Q^{simple}$.\n\n- Moreover, how sigma is defined to achieve the desired number of parts (number of group truth parts)? How robust is the proposed method to different choices of $\\sigma$?\n\n- Maybe I missed it, but I think $\\delta$ is never properly defined. Moreover, Fig.1 is not helpful unless more context is given. What Fig. 1 illustrates?\n\n- In the Training details paragraph, $Y$ is used to refer to part centers but in the Q Prediction paragraph is used to refer to per-point features. In this same paragraph, the centers are referred as $\\mu$ instead. Moreover, $\\pi$ is never defined. From the formulas, I suppose it refers to the per-point weights of each of the Gaussians in the GMM.\n\n- In Training details, it is not clear how the loss would work. $Y_{GT} \\in R^{n \\times d}$, but $Y_l \\in R^{k \\times d}$ if they are the part centers as the text indicates. Moreover, is each layer supervised by this loss or only the last one?\n\n- In network architecture, it is not clear which network architecture is used. First, it indicates that PoinNet is used but later SpareConv layers are used. From the appendix, I believe all layers are PointNet layers, but I don't understand where the SparseConv layers come into play.\n\n- Regarding evaluation, I believe it needs significant improvement before publication. Here is a list of possible experiments that would help improve the evaluation:\n\t- Comparison with different choices of sigma in the layers.\n\t- Visualization of the intermediate partition assignments will help understand the behavior of the model.\n\t- Experiments on other datasets, such as ShapeNet part segmentation and real 3D scans such as ScanNet.\n\t- Several relevant baselines missing. Only one global rotation equivariant network is used in the comparisons, Vector Neurons. It would be necessary to compare to network architectures that are locally equivariant such as E2PN, LieConv, or simple graph convolution networks. It is not relevant to show improvement over basic point architectures such as PointNet or DGCNN."

(2) can be used to measure the probability of drawing a bad partition from a non-proper subpartition of $Z_*$. The rationale behind defining $Q_{simple}$ in that manner and the behavior of the number $\\lambda(Q_{simple})$ as $k$ tends to $n$ also need further clarification.\n- The approximation error defined in Definition 1 depends on $M$ which is an unknown and possibly large number. Therefore, it is unclear how this approximation error can be employed to control the errors occurring in experiments. For example, given a positive number $\\epsilon$ how can we design the model in a way that the approximation error does not exceed $\\epsilon$?\n- PointNet and DGCNN are non-equivariant models. Therefore, it may not be fair to compare the proposed model with them. Instead, it would be interesting to assess the efficiency of the proposed model compared to other equivariant models for point clouds, with suitable modifications to make them equivariant for partitions of the point clouds."

The sentence \"this simple model enables bounding the equivariance approximation error solely by the probability of drawing a 'bad' partition. Crucially, this bound is independent of any required restriction on the resulting piecewise equivariant model function bounded variation.\" is difficult to follow in the introduction without more context, before read all the theorems and technical details afterwards.\n- Equation 2, as I understand it, as long as the two partitions are inconsistent, | $||ZZ^T - Z_{\\ast}Z_{\\ast}^T|| > 0$, even if $Z$ is a finer partition of $Z_{\\ast}$? Is that correct? If not, can you explain why?\n- Theorem 1, is it possible the $\\arg\\max$ would give a set rather than a single value (i.e. ties)? Would that cause any problems?\n- Table 1, can the authors discuss why the performance of vector neurons are so bad, even compared to baselines?"
