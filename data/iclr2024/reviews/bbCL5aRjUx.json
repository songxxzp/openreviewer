The core layer of MONet is capable of capturing high-degree multiplicative channel-mixing operations for tokens, enabling non-linearity and, as a result, eliminating the need for activation layers. Extensive experiments were conducted on various image recognition and scientific computing benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous polynomial networks and achieving results on par with state-of-the-art CNNs and Transformers."

In ImageNet, the Multi-stage MONet-S achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art, all without the use of any activations. It's also worth noting its robustness to image corruptions. When applied to solving ODEs, its performance appears strong based on the provided cases. The extensive experiments seem to highlight numerous promising characteristics of this new design, which warrant further exploration.\n2. MONet simplifies prior polynomial networks by utilizing mu-layers. It appears reasonable that mu-layers are designed to accommodate only two-degree polynomials, as stacking these mu-layers enables high-order interactions."

FLOPS/parameters appear reasonable in Table 1 compared to other models, however it seems perhaps VRAM usage is much more (see below), which is practically the bottleneck in most GPU-based training.\n* One area where MONets may have more interpretability might be useful is in very specific cases, such as particular ODEs, that have a similar polynomial representation (as demonstrated in 4.4), but this seems like a very niche case.\n* An Ablation analysis on the proposed methodology in the architecture is performed."

We are given a sentence in the introduction \"Interpretability and encryption...\" with no reasons at all given as to why the proposed model architecture would be any more amenable to interpretation or encryption, and certainly no such results/analysis. Even the most academic work needs motivation. Getting closer to reaching state-of-the-art performance on some task alone is not enough of a motivation for a method if there are no tangible benefits over existing methods (and especially when it seems there are disadvantages in memory usage as covered below).\n* Similarly, why are we interested in getting rid of activation functions? No motivation is given for this explicitly, and the only reason I can think of given the interpretability word is to remove non-linearity in the mapping from input to output. A sentence in the conclusion backs this up: \"which avoids the requirement for activation functions or other non-linear mappings\". However, the \"multilinear\" operation in this work is itself still a non-linear mapping of input to output (a polynomial of degree 2), making this statement false.\n* The background is *way* too short and doesn't give near enough information on the current work's context in polynomial network literature.\n* While the method is detailed enough, with much more detail in the appendix on some of the most interesting bits, the paper doesn't explain much at all what specifically is different from current polynomial networks, seemingly assuming the reader should know this. It is up to the authors to explain how their method fits into the current research literature in the background and method and compare their method explicitly with the closest existing work in literature.\n* Requires 4 A100 GPUs to train for a batch size of 448 according to the authors (and they say they maximize batch size). This means that the maximum batch size on each GPU is 112. This is **much more VRAM usage** than the baselines being compared to that are achieving similar accuracy on ImageNet1K - for example, ViT B/16 can fit with a batch size of 256 on a single A100, and ResNet-50 a batch size of 512 on a single A100. Note it is not clear if these are 40GB or 80GB A100 models.\n* Bold figures in captions are misleading, and do not it turns out always represent the best result as you might expect! For example, in Table 2"

In other words motivate your research work and method.\n* Explain the statement \"...which avoids the requirement for activation functions or other non-linear mappings\" in the conclusion.
