                "value": "1. The methodology introduced in this paper is an extension of the RADP method, with the primary modification being the linearization of the nonlinear system. However, the implications of such linearization are not distinctly outlined, nor is there a clear comparative analysis with the traditional RADP method. The absence of a detailed examination of the linearization's impact raises questions about the method's efficacy and novelty.\n\n2. The authors suggest that the rationale behind employing the RCI framework is its potential to enhance the PE condition. Nevertheless, the explanation as to why this approach is effective is insufficiently substantiated. Furthermore, the connection between the RCI and the employed linearization technique is ambiguous, resulting in a fragmented logical flow in the methodology's presentation.\n\n3. The proposed methodology presupposes a comprehensive understanding of system dynamics. However, with known system dynamics, one could conduct policy iteration directly using a \"differential\" formulation as opposed to the \"integral\" formulation, which seems unnecessarily convoluted. For instance, a comparison could be made with the \"Relaxed Actor-Critic\" method detailed in [1], which offers a solution to the HJB equation through policy iteration in the context of fully understood system dynamics.\n\nReference: [1] J. Duan et al., \"Relaxed Actor-Critic With Convergence Guarantees for Continuous-Time Optimal Control of Nonlinear Systems,\" in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, vol. 8, no. 5, pp. 3299-3311, May 2023, doi: 10.1109/TIV.2023.3255264.\n\n4. Unfortunately, the link provided for the open-source code corresponding to the paper's methodology is inaccessible, which hinders peer verification and replicability of the results presented.\n\n5. The proof presented for Theorem 2.1 is unconvincing. It employs the Closed-Loop Stability attribute of Kleinman\u2019s Algorithm, but the narrative fails to clarify why this particular inference is applicable to nonlinear systems as well. The proof lacks a thorough explanation, making the applicability of Kleinman\u2019s Algorithm to nonlinear systems questionable."

The authors also use some notations and concepts and describe them later; which make it harder to track; those should be mentioned at the conceptual presentation stage.\nAlso for experimental sections, I guess it is because of page limit, it is a bit hard to parse what is going on (no indent, no new line...).\n3.

This work failed to mention other similar works in continuous-time LQR setting where different exploitation of the same linear-quadratic structure (as Kleinman's method) leads to different theoretical guarantees and efficient algorithms. The authors may want to conduct a thorough survey on existing works and compare their approaches with other model-based continuous-time LQR methods. A few examples can be found like:\n\n[1] Jeongho Kim, Jaeuk Shin, and Insoon Yang. Hamilton-jacobi deep q-learning for deterministic continuous-time systems with lipschitz continuous controls. The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 22(1):9363\u20139396, 2021.\n\n[2] Haoran Wang, Thaleia Zariphopoulou, and Xun Yu Zhou. Reinforcement learning in continuous time and space: A stochastic control approach. The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 21(1): 8145\u20138178, 2020.\n\n2. It is questionable if the method in this work can be fairly compared to other general purpose RL methods or ADP methods, since the latter typically won't consider the specific underlying structure of the control problem. The authors may want to proceed more carefully when utilizing FVI as the benchmark and perform comparison for tasks like pendulum for which model-based LQR-type algorithm can easily excel."
