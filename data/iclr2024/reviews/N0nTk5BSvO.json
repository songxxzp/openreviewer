Clarifying these key concepts will make the presentation clearer.\n3. Only the overall metrics for predicting accuracy are reported. It is unclear what recurring and non-recurring patterns that TESTAM captured while other methods miss. Some in-depth experimental analysis (see Q4 for details) will better support the claim of the first contribution."

In the abstract, the authors state that TESTAM can model isolated nodes, highly related nodes, and recurring and non-recurring events. Can you provide some experimental results and analysis for this claim, e.g. case study?\n\nMinor:\n1. Please add comments to the meaning of results in bold and underlined in Table 1.\n2. Descriptions and analysis of the qualitative examples in the supplementary material are missing.\n3. Why are some equations in section 3 not numbered?

There are many typos, and some incorrect writings can seriously mislead the readers:\n   - '...choose spatial modeling methods (i.e., expert) properly; and' on page one.\n   - $f(X^{(t)},\\theta)$ should be replaced by 'g(X^{(t)},\\theta)' on page three.\n   - In the formulas at the bottom of page five, the superscript (k) in $W_{q}^{(k)}$ and $W_{k}^{(k)}$ appears to be meaningless and should be replaced by $W_q$ and $W_k$.\n   - On the fifth page, $\\[\\tau^{(t+1),...,\\tau^{(t+T)}\\]$ should be changed to $\\[\\tau^{(t+1),...,\\tau^{(t+T')}\\]$.\n   - In formula 5 on the sixth page, 'larger than q-th quantile' should be corrected to 'smaller than q-th quantile.'\n   - In the seventh page, the sentence 'excludes the relatively coarse-grained loss function only' should have 'only' removed.\n   - The functions such as 'Concat' and the activation functions 'relu' should be written as upright letters.\n   - Some formulas have equation numbers, while others do not.\n\nW2. The effectiveness of Time-enhanced Attention has not been verified through ablation experiments, and readers cannot determine whether it truly enhances the model's predictive performance.\n\nW3. The distinction between best-route selection and worst routing avoidance is not clear. When introducing best-route selection, the authors mention node-wise routing and node-wise pseudo-label but haven't explained them. Additionally, changing 'smaller than q-th quantile' to 'smaller than (1-q)-th quantile' alone is considered best-route selection, but the reason for this change has not been provided.\n\nW4. Experimental results:\n   - The experimental results are inconsistent. In Table 2, the results for TESTAM in the ablation experiment are for a 30-minute forecast, but they do not match the results in Table 1. Additionally, I noticed that in Table 2, the PEMS-BAY dataset performs better in the 'w/o gating' condition than the complete TESTAM model in Table 1.\n\n   - The magnitude of the performance improvement is minimal. Table 1 shows that many metrics only slightly improve in terms of percentiles, at the cost of three times the computational time and memory for building three expert models.\n\nW5. The title doesn\u2019t well match with this study itself. Actually, this work mostly focuses on traffic forecasting, but the title   suggesting a new general Spatio-Temporal Attention Model with MoE seems much more general and broader."
