Since the authors claim that an equivalent resampling is just as good, an important baseline in long-tail would be to compare against MiSLAS.\n3. Could you an analysis where the test distribution is also skewed, independent of the training distribution? How is the performance of existing methods and the derived resampling distribution from Selective Mixup one of the claims made is that these methods are useful because the balancing effect on the training distribution performs well when the testing data is uniform.\n4. I find a lack of novelty in the finding that mixup yields a training distribution with higher entropy, i.e., closer to the uniform distribution, Could you provide any strong theoretical justification that the actual mixup is not contributing to an improvement in the performance since existing works such as MiSLAS do show superior performance to vanilla classifier retraining on training with class balanced samplers."

However, claiming that the performance between selective sampling is similar to that of selective Mixup seems somewhat strained. For instance, in the case of \"Diff. domain+ Same class,\" selective Mixup demonstrates a $6\\%$ higher accuracy than selective sampling. What accounts for the superiority of selective Mixup over selective sampling in this scenario?\n\n2. Similarly, in Figure 2, for ''Same domain'', ''Diff. class'' and ''Diff. domain + Diff. class'', selective sampling is much better than selective Mixup, does this indicate that vanilla Mixup is harmful in this case? Such observations are more evident in Figure 8. The authors have not discussed the reasons behind the occasional superiority of selective Mixup over selective sampling.\n\n3. In Figure 6, given the effective performance of vanilla Mixup, it appears that vanilla Mixup is the main driver for the improvement in selective Mixup, even with the optimal criteria. This observation contradicts the third point outlined in the summarized contributions in the Introduction.\n\n4. In Figure 6, it is observed that for the case of ''Diff. domain + Same class,'' selective Mixup performs worse than vanilla Mixup. Does this observation imply that the resampling effect may have a degrading impact on the performance of Mixup?\n\nI would be willing to increase my score if the authors addressed my concerns."

The datasets often demonstrate conflicting conclusions, for example, results on Arxiv are much different from the Waterbird. Hence, it\u2019s hard to obtain final conclusions. The results on various datasets can be combined which contain similar problem settings and demonstrate consistent results.\n\nInconsistency in Experimental Setups: There is a difference between the number of methods considered for each dataset. Hence, it\u2019s hard to parse which combination of methods is most effective on average across all the datasets.\n\nNovelty: However, the authors have done a considerable amount of experiments.
