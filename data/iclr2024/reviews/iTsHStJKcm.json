                "value": "- **W1 - Technical insights are unclear for the deformable and the general robotics manipulation community.** \n\nOn pre-existing tasks, the paper attempts to show that LLM can generate geometrical representations of intermediate subgoals that guide action planning. \n\nIt seems that the take-home message for the paper is that we can build a planning framework with LLM to do these pre-existing tasks. However, the results and analysis provided by the authors **do not convince me that existing frameworks such as PASTA[1] cannot accomplish the proposed tasks**. \n\nSpecifically, the result section lacks discussion, visualization, and analysis of (1) why baseline approaches like PASTA did not perform well, (2) which part of the pipeline is responsible for the failure (e.g., perception, planning, control), and (3) how do the proposed LLM planning techniques in this paper overcome these challenges.\n\nAnother suggestion I would like to give is to come up with a task that previous approaches really struggled to complete. Currently, the capability demonstrated in this paper, in both simulation and the real world, does not convince me that the proposed approach outperforms prior works.\n\n\n- **W2 - Unconvincing real robot experiments.** \n\nIn the real robot experiments showcased in the supplementary video, the approach struggles to complete the desired shapes. For instance, at timestamp 01:51 of the video, the robot struggles to split the dough into halves. Plus, a human operator, in almost all tasks, needs to hold the rubber cushion below the dough to make physical interactions stable.\n\nIn addition, textual and pictorial details are missing in both the video and the paper. It would be helpful for the authors to provide **the desired final shape**, **the intermediate shapes generated by LLM**, and **the achieved shapes after real robot executions**. It would also be helpful for the authors to discuss how the incorporation of LLM makes a difference, and which part of the pipeline is responsible for failure cases.\n\n- **W3 - The paper lacks a discussion on the limitations of optimal transport.**\n\nThe paper incorporates many techniques that hinge on optimal transport measures being faithful. However, many works such as [2] and [3] have discussed that optimal transport is limited to heavy geometrical characterization of shape differences, and lacks the physical prior to capture the \"physical distance\" to transform one dough shape into another. Please see Figure 4. in [2] as well as the discussion of topology preservation in [3] when directly using optimal transport gradients to transform the shape, which is what the authors are doing in this paper.\n\nIt would be helpful for the authors to provide discussions on how the proposed LLM approach could face the optimal-transport-related challenges in the limitation section. \n\n- **W4 -  Missing visualization of the next reachable point cloud.**\n\nThe authors propose to use optimal transport gradients to geometrically transform the shape. As I mentioned in W3, this transformation does not preserve the topological structures of the initial shape and could lead to planning errors. The system therefore could struggle to generalize. It would be helpful for the authors to visualize the next reachable point cloud obtained from warping the initial shape, and how faithful can the low-level differentiable optimizer recover that shape. It would also be helpful to discuss failure cases due to incorrect next-reachable point clouds in the limitation section.  \n\n\n**Minor Remarks - *Incorrect characterization* of an existing work**.\n\n> Existing works on dough-like volumetric deformable objects majorly rely on a learned dynamic model of the underlying particles Zhu et al. (2022); Arriola-Rios et al. (2020); Yin et al. (2021); **Huang et al. (2021)**. \n\n\nHuang et al. (2021) does not rely on a data-driven or \"learned\" dynamics model. The paper proposes to leverage a built-in differentiable physics engine for trajectory optimization and is thus misrepresented in this citation. I propose that you change this to a more appropriate citation. \n\nI thank the authors for providing the results of building the LLM-incorporated pipeline. I am happy to increase the score if the authors could make the technical insights of the paper clear, and provide more convincing results and balanced discussions.\n\n[1] Lin et al., Planning with spatial-temporal abstraction from point clouds for deformable object manipulation, CORL 2022.\n\n[2] Li et al., DexDeform: Dexterous Deformable Object Manipulation with Human Demonstrations and Differentiable Physics, ICLR 2023.\n\n[3] Jean Feydy, Geometric data analysis, beyond convolutions, PhD thesis."

                "value": "This paper presents a planning-based algorithm for deformable object manipulation from language instructions. Here, the deformable objects are represented as point clouds. At the core of the algorithm are 2 main components. 1. The LLM breaks down the high-level task into more concrete subtasks. 2. Within each subtask, the differentiable-physics-based planner computes the desired initial location and motion of the tool to rearrange the particles towards the desired configuration.\n\nIn the first stage, GPT-4 is queried to break down the language instruction into actionable subtasks. Concretely, GPT-4 is provided with the available tools, the initial point cloud representation of the dough, and the task. It is then queried to select the appropriate tool and write a Python script to generate the desired ending configuration for each subtask.\n\nIn the planning stage, the planner takes the assigned tool, the current dough configuration, and the desired configuration. It iteratively plans to make progress towards the desired point cloud. First, each particle is shifted toward the direction that reduces the EMD between the current and goal point cloud, creating an intermediate goal with dense p2p correspondence. Next, the tool is placed closest to the current point cloud. Then, the tool's movement is optimized by taking gradient steps with the differentiable physics simulator to morph the point cloud toward the intermediate goal.\n\nThe authors compared the proposed method with an optimization-based method, a planning method, behavior cloning, and reinforcement learning in 6 tasks in simulation. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly higher performance. The method is also successfully deployed on a real robot with planning done in simulation, which shows robustness in modeling discrepancy."
