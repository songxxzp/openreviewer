Then, the fine model will refine the accurate landmark locations based on the estimated coarse locations from the previous step. The experimental results have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

In a second step it re-samples again, at a finer scale, the face, eyes and mouth spatial locations. In both steps the reconstructed face volume, combined with positional encoding,  are the input to a CNN that estimates the face pose and the configuration parameters of a bi-linear model (a compressed version of FaceScape's) representing identity and expression, from which a set of 3D landmarks can be produced.\n\nThe experimentation evaluates the accuracy of the estimated landmarks so as their use for face editing and swapping."

I have several comments concerning this experiment:\n- The evaluation is performed with 5 identities from the test dataset from FaceScape.  While this experiment provides some information, a sound comparison should include several other benchmark datasets in the literature and a widely used metric, such as e.g. the mean, median and std reconstruction errors.\n- Is the comparison fair?  I have doubts since FLNeRF was trained with a train set from FaceScape, whereas competing approaches seem to have been trained with different datasets.\n- In 2D datasets landmarks around the jaw do not have a fixed location, but rather represent the face occluding contour, so a reconstruction from their correspondences does not make much sense.\n\nFinally, the experimentation concerning the estimation of landmarks on in-the-wild images, was made with a single image of president Obama, in which the estimated landmark locations are not very good."
