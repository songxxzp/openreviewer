                "value": "This works present a new method for real-time mutual information (MI) estimate. The core of the method is a network that maps a population of empirical samples to the optimal function r(x,y) = p(x, y)/p(x)p(y). This optimal function is represented by a look-up table where the values of x, y are quantized into several bins (e.g. 100). To train this network, the authors use an idea similar to simulation-based inference, that they first extensively simulate data from various artificial distributions, then learn the relationship between the data population and the function r(x, y) behind. It is believed that after seeing sufficiently many artificial distributions, the network can cover the case in real world. Compared to traditional methods which learns r(x, y) from scratch, this method pre-compute r(x, y) via simulation, thereby is much faster at inference time. In addition to MI estimate, the idea can also be extended to compute Renyi's maximal correlation coefficient."

The method does a good job in trying to take the advantage of both worlds;\n- **Novelty**: the idea of this work, to my knowledge, is very novel within the context of MI and statistical dependence estimate. While many recent works have also focused on scalable computation of mutual information and statistical dependence [1, 2, 3, 4], this work presents an orthogonal possibility. The idea of learning to map the data population to the optimal neural estimator via massive simulation is so interesting, and the way to implement this idea via attention-based network is also technically sensible. In fact, the idea of simulation-based learning is not new, particularly in the field of statistics (see e.g. [5, 6]). However, the paper is the first one to apply this idea to statistical dependence modelling; \n- **Presentation**: the paper is also mostly well-written and easy to follow. I enjoy reading the paper very much.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] The Randomized Dependence Coefficient, NeurIPS 2017\n\n[2] Sliced mutual information: A scalable measure of statistical dependence, NeurIPS 2021\n\n[3] Scalable Infomin Learning, NeurIPS 2022\n\n[4] Fairness-Aware Learning for Continuous Attributes and Treatments, ICML 2019\n\n[5] Simulation intelligence: Towards a new generation of scientific methods, arxiv 2112.03235\n\n[6] The frontier of simulation-based inference, PNAS 2020"

                "value": "- **Limitations** (major): while very interesting, the proposed method seems only work for low-dimensional data. This is due to (a) the limitation of simulation-based learning itself, where as the dimensionality grows it becomes more and more difficult to cover diverse cases of distributions; (b) the number of grids in the lookup table grows exponentially with the dimensionality of data, making the discrete representation proposed impractical. That being said, the idea can expect to work well in e.g. 1D/2D cases;\n- **Experiments** (major):  the experiments in this paper are done on synthetic dataset and one (relatively simple) real-world dataset, which is a bit disappointing compared to the interesting idea. In this regard, I think the current experiments do not really show the potential of the method developed. The synthetic task regarding maximal correlation is also not so intutitive/easy-to-understand to me compared to those done in existing works [1, 3, 4]. Why not test the power of the method in the presence of different statistical association patterns (see [1, 3, 4])?;\n- **Discussion on relationship to related works**: as mentioned in the strength block above, the paper presents a new method for estimating statistical dependence in a highly efficient way. It will be ideal to have a discussion between your method and these existing works, highlighting why your method is more preferable compared to these prior works. In addition, it *may* also be nice to mention the connection of your work and the field of simulation-based intelligence due to the inherent similarity between the underlying principles. This will connect your work with the broader community;\n- **Presentation** (minor): while the presentation is overall good, it was only after reading Section 3.1 and Algorithm 1 I can understand your method. In fact, Section 3.1 seems to be important description of the core training algorithm of your method. I think it would be easier to understand for readers if the authors make this part a separate section (e.g. training algorithm) rather than part of the experiments. There are also some typos/errors in the text (for example `MIN-100\u2019 in Table 1)."

Mutual information estimation methods based on the Donsker-Varadhan formula, such as MINE, are primarily designed for estimating mutual information between complex real-world data (e.g., CLIP). Comparing these to simple scalar setups seems inequitable. Should the proposed method be effective with high-dimensional data, the author is advised to validate it through experimentation.\n\n3. Relying solely on Gaussian Mixture Models for training appears to be a limited approach, raising questions about its generalizability to other distributions. To validate training based solely on Gaussian Mixtures, the author should experiment with a variety of distributions. For further reference:\nCzyz et al., \"Beyond Normal: On the Evaluation of Mutual Information Estimators.\"\n\n4. The core concept is to approximate the critic function $\\theta$ which maximizes the Donsker-Varadhan formula using a neural network. The function that truly maximizes this is given by $\\log p(x,y)/p(x)p(y)$. It seems implausible that a single pretrained neural network could accomplish this for every joint distribution $p(x, y)$."

For instance, Energy Distance (ED) by G\u00e1bor  Sz\u00e9kely is one of them which is a dual form of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). In particular, ED  does not require any parametric assumption about the underlying probability distribution of the data, making it easy for many statistical inference problems. It is a good idea to compare the proposed MI estimator and MCC with ED in terms of the correlation of two random variables (similar to Figure 4 ) and computational speed given the fact that ED is quite fast to use in high dimensional data."

For MINE, we still use NNs to parameterize a function and output a scalar via NNs. Is MINE a feed-forward prediction? Please elaborate it.\n\n- 'Moreover, each time the joint distribution changes (different sequences), a new optimization has to be performed, thus not efficient.' -- For Figure 1, which type of sequences are you considering? I don't understand 'a new optimization has to be performed'. Could you please elaborate more? Figure 1 lacks necessary contexts.\n\n- 'This way, we transform the optimization-based estimation into a feed-forward prediction, thus bypassing the time-consuming gradient computation and avoiding sub-optimality via large-scale training on a wide spectrum of distributions.' -- For MINE, we do need to update NNs' parameters. But InfoNet also needs gradient ascent. How to understand 'bypassing the time-consuming gradient computation'?\n\nAll in all, I think the confusion is due to the lack of enough explanations. Could you please elaborate the difference between MINE and InfoNet? The same training objective is used. Both can parameterize the function via NNs, even the same NN architecture.\n\n\n### Method\n\n- To estimate mutual information between two sequences in Eq.(2), InfoNet only considers $(x_{t}, y_{t})$ at each time step? Thus, it ignores mutual information between e.g., $x_{1}$ and $y_{2}$?\n\n- In terms of Figure 2, the difference between MINE and InfoNet is just a look-up table? I think same NN architectures could also be used in MINE?\n\n---\n**Update after rebuttal**: I raised the score: 5 --> 6."
