The author realizes that binary compression causes the loss of high-frequency features in the SR model, which is important for SR tasks. Therefore, the author improves the representation capability of features through residual binarization, and the accuracy rate is significantly improved.\n \n(3) The proposed residual binarization technology is efficient. I think this technology attempts to use a balanced trade-off to solve the performance bottleneck of the binary SR model and maintain the acceleration properties of the bitwise operations of the computing unit (as described in Eq. 9). Since heads and tails are generally not quantified, the binary SR model using this technique adds negligible computation yet significantly improves accuracy.\n \n(4) The binary distillation method is effective and versatile. The distillation between binarized and full-precision networks is natural since they have almost the same architecture. This allows distillation methods to run well on CNN and transformer-based models."

                "value": "First, the flexible residual binarization proposed in this manuscript is effective and efficient. As the most extreme quantization method, binarization discretizes weights and activations to the greatest extent (1-bit), making it difficult for filters and features to extract details, that is, the high-frequency information mentioned in the article. The manuscript uses the second-order residual binarization of weights to restore the feature extraction abilities of the binarized SR network and maintain the acceleration brought by the XNOR-POPCNT instruction in inference. More importantly, compared with existing binarized SR methods, such as ABC-Net and HORQ, residual operations on weights do not bring an inference burden (compared to activation residuals).\n\nSecondly, unlike some existing quantized SR methods, the proposed FRB is structurally universal, which allows the method to be widely used in various structural variants. The proposed binarization method acts at the operator level without affecting the overall architecture of the model. As for distillation, the full-precision counterpart of the binarized network is used, which has the same structure. This makes the proposed distillation flexible for various architectures.\n\nThird, the accuracy and efficiency results of FRB are outstanding. Regarding accuracy, FRB achieves SOTA performance and surpasses existing binarized SR methods by a convincing margin. Regarding efficiency, since the unquantized head and tail account for most of the computational consumption in the binarized SR network, the burden caused by residual binarization is very small. Furthermore, the proposed method produces good visual effects in addition to quantitative results.\n\nFinally, the manuscript is well-written and understandable, and the figures and formulas are well-presented."

Although few existing SR works discuss this point, practical deployment is crucial for binarization methods.\n[1] Larq: An open-source library for training binarized neural networks\n[2] dabnn: A super fast inference framework for binary neural networks on arm devices\n\nFor the proposed binarization-aware distillation method, the motivation for using blockwise distillation granularity is unclear (why not the more flexible layerwise).
