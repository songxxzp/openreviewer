                "value": "1. The mechanism relies heavily on the assumption that malicious clients will remain below 50% of the total. However, its effectiveness may be limited if this assumption does not hold, as adversarial clients constituting over half the clients could possibly sabotage the defense. The authors did not sufficiently discuss limitations to the mechanism or potential strategies if this threshold is exceeded.\n\n2. The proposed method relies on applying the **Three Sigma Rule** to identify outlier clients, but does not adequately justify the underlying assumption that client behavior will follow a **Gaussian/normal distribution**. Without evidence or validation that the models meet this statistical requirement, the correctness and reliability of using this rule is unclear. The authors need to provide empirical or theoretical support for why these distributions were expected in this context, otherwise the key thresholding technique lacks rigorous foundation. \n\n3. The paper claims to propose a new defensive mechanism, but its core algorithms - Krum, Three Sigma Rule and Zero-knowledge proofs - are already well-established in prior work. While integrating existing techniques can still yield new systems, the paper does not provide sufficient insight into how this combination offers meaningful advantage. Without novel algorithmic or analytical insights, the technical value of merely assembling known pieces is limited. To strengthen the paper, the authors should demonstrate deeper understanding of how this specific integration improves upon the state-of-the-art.\n\n4. The evaluation of the proposed method's scalability and performance is limited by the small-scale datasets used (e.g. FEMNIST, CIFAR). While useful for proof-of-concept, these datasets do not adequately represent the data and computational heterogeneity of modern large-scale Federated Learning systems. To fully demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of this defense, it will be important for the authors to test its performance and overhead when applied to real-world FL scenarios at a larger scale. Without such experimentation on industry-grade datasets and systems, the approach's scalability and real-world viability remain uncertain."
