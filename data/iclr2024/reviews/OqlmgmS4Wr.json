The authors propose a 3 stage approach: generating instructions, collecting trajectories, and filtering them based on task reward. For tasks where instructions are not already given, the paper uses similar auxiliary tasks or zero-shot prompts the LLM to construct a task input and outputs. Trajectories are collected by prompting the LLM agent using ReAct to generate actions, running in the environment to collect rewards and extra feedback, and continuing in a loop till an episode is terminated. Trajectories are filtered based on task specific thresholds. Finally, this trajectory corpus is combined with ShareGPT corpus to train a Llama-2 model. The authors show that the model improves baseline Llama-2 on decision making tasks while keeping its general capabilities and is competitive with GPT-4."

Some of the design decisions are also not explained.\n\n1. While the agent trajectories are very valuable and costly to collect, they are mainly extracted from public tasks/benchmarks by using ReAct with GPT models. The overall process with instruction generation, trajectory collection, and filtering can be useful for other data collection efforts but they are relatively straightforward. For example, ReAct/COT prompting is used with no significant change, reward filtering is also a standard practice in imitation learning. I suggest highlighting main challenges and how significant they are in addition to remedies that you introduced.\n\n2. Using an already available corpora with ReAct and filtering trajectories based on a threshold seems to be reducing the size of the data drastically. For example, in Mind2Web, only a tiny fraction is kept. It is not clear if the benefit of COT annotated trajectories can overcome the reduction in the data size. Can you present results where you make use of the data as much as possible even if you can\u2019t inject COT annotations?\n\n3. How did you choose $\\eta$? Given that it denotes the tradeoff between broader generalization vs agent-task performance, it is important to highlight its impact. Are your models sensitive to this parameter? \n\n4. Similarly, how did you decide 1:4 ratio for GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5?\n\n5. What is GPT-4\u2019s interaction trajectory with the DB? How did you end up collecting multi-turn dialogues?

One of the down-sides for open-source LLMs is the ability to generalize to `different' settings from training, but the proposed work has essentially made AgentBench in-distribution by training.\n2. It seems that GPT models are heavily relied on for generating training data. Do we have some sense of how to go beyond GPT models? Suppose we want to push the boundaries of GPT-4, then GPT-4 data may not work as well.\n3. I have concerns for generalization to other agent tasks that are distinct, but not captured in agent-bench. For example, driving or operating Minecraft.\n\nOverall, my main concern is that the improvements might have come from better instruction following, not agent reasoning.\n\nMinor issues:\n- Figure 1 (a), Where does the overall score stand against GPT-4, from which you collected training data?"

I think it is a significant contribution to the LLM community. However, I have some concerns as the following.\n- The authors claim that they use a reward $r$ to filter out low-quality trajectories, but how this reward is calculated/generated is unclear to me. Besides, as the trajectories are generated by GPT3.5/4, I think the trajectories may contain some misleading information. I wonder whether there is a human evaluation of the correctness of the trajectories.\n- It leverages a hybrid instruction-tuning strategy, which is a simple multi-task training in essence. Based on my understanding, improving the agent ability while preserving the general language understanding ability is close to a continual learning scenario. So I think it is important to discuss some typical training strategies like weight regularization[1] and parameter allocation[2] used in continual learning. And it would be better if you can further provide some results when such strategies are applied to see whether these strategies can benefit training.\n- The rationale behind some design choices is not well-explained. For example, why is the ratio of sampling between GPT3.5 and GPT4 set as 1:4 and why is the threshold of reward $r$ is set as 2/3? Are there any rules or experimental explanations for these choices?  \n\n[1] Kirkpatrick et al. Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks.
