                "value": "This work proposes a three-step framework to improve one-shot pruning for large language models to potentially accelerate inference. In the first step, the method performs a standard one-shot pruning such as the SparseGPT method; in the second step, they perform a dense reconstruction of the sparse model to reactivate the pruned connections, aiming to identify a dense model with enhanced pruning awareness; and in the last step, they perform pruning again for the reconstructed model. Comparison to SparseGPT methods show that this three-step method performs better than one-shot pruning with a single pruning step."

I believe that the framework is independent from the base pruning method, thus doing experiments on top of a strong existing method is highly recommended.\n- **Performing experiments on stronger base models:** A clear trend that is disclosed by comparing SparseGPT and Wanda in Sun et al., 2023 is that the stronger the base model is, the more the pruning process hurts the performance of the model. For example, in the SparseGPT paper, pruning retains the model performance on OPT models; however, when Sun et al., 2023 evaluates on LLaMA based models, the performance degradation is way more significant. Such observations make intuitive sense, as the more stronger the base model is, the more information each parameter carries, and the more the model performance gets hurt when the parameter gets pruned. Given this observation, I suggest the authors test on stronger base models like LLaMA to give a more accurate account of how practical one-shot pruning is for real applications.\n- **The extra step leads to diminishing returns in performance as the model scales up:** From table 2, it\u2019s clear that as the model scales up and becomes stronger, the performance of the the re-dense and r-=prune process leads to minimal improvement compared to simply using one step of pruning."

The first sparse framework directly uses existing one-shot pruning algorithms, and the authors use SparseGPT during this phase. Then, a layer-wise knowledge distillation is applied using unlabeled training samples to recover the pruned connections in the model. The paper claims that the recovered dense model has enhanced pruning awareness for the subsequent pruning step. Finally, SparseGPT is applied again with weight adjusting to obtain the SDS sparse model which performs better than SparseGPT on smaller OPT models and on-par with SparseGPT on the larger models. The empirical performance is measured on raw-wikitext2 using perplexity and on some zero-shot downstream tasks like COPA, RTE, StoryCloze, Winogrande, etc."

Secondly, the performance of OPT class of models on pre-training and various downstream tasks is itself not good. So, are the gains reported in the paper statistically significant, or they lie within the standard deviation of the performance of OPT models on these tasks.\n- Sparsity and pruning research is more relevant for larger models to reduce their inference time and the GPU/TPU memory footprint. But the proposed method only matches SparseGPT's performance for the larger models. Is the further Dense-Sparse pruning even necessary?\n- The paper should also report results on the speedup obtained compared to the dense and SparseGPT models with varying model size and sparsity category (50%, 2:4, 4:8)."
