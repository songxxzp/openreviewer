It is fine to make some mistakes at the first step. Here, the reviewer would like to point out some possible mistakes in this paper. \n\n1. If the authors want to use machine learning to study the problem in a new research area, please check the evaluation metric in that area first. For example, the so-called chemical accuracy in quantum chemistry is about 1.7 mHa = 0.0017 Ha. However, in this paper, all the calculation results are given at the level of 0.1 Ha, which is far from the requirement for the evaluation. \n\n2. Please check if there is some existing terminology that aligns with your methodology. Generating DFT data and learning them through neural networks is a well-established research area. One can find related algorithms on Google by searching \"machine learning force field\". \n\n3. Before creating your dataset, please check if there is an existing dataset that can meet your requirements. As for this paper, there are plenty of existing datasets where the authors can compare the proposed method with existing baselines, e.g., Molecular Dynamics 17, Open Catalyst Project.\n\n4. Please make sure the benchmark is meaningful. For example, a comparison between NN-VMC methods (FermiNet/Psiformer) and DFT methods in terms of total energy is meaningless, because the NN-VMC methods directly deal with the Schrodinger equation while the DFT methods compute the energy through the energy functional."

T2E combines text-to-vector encoding with a physics-informed multilayer perceptron (PIMLP). T2E encoder  converts the material name, 3D coordinates, and spin into a vector representation which is then fed into PIMLP for predicting total energy. The PIMLP layer incorporates physics knowledge by using the spin, mass number, and valence electrons as additional features. T2E is evaluated on various elements, small molecules, and untrained materials. It matches or exceeds the accuracy of other methods like FermiNet, PsiFormer, and VMC. Overall, T2E is a strong PoC that leverages pre-trained text encoders and physics informed modules (PIMLP) for predicting total energy of a system. This mix of techniques is novel and hasn't been used in similar machine learning models."

High accuracy with minimal parameters: T2E matches or exceeds SOTA methods like DFT and FermiNet while using far fewer parameters (~52k for PIMLP). This allows fast and accurate predictions with minimal training.\n\n3. A major strength is the low computational scaling and training times of T2E. T2E exhibits constant cost with system size rather than quadratic/exponential scaling for other methods such as DFT. \n\n4. Text encoder allows T2E to work directly from basic material names, coordinates and spin. No need for manually engineering features or preprocessing."

Ablation studies that remove various parts of T2E could help clarify how important each component is to the model's performance. This is not explored in the current version of the paper. For example, why was the CLIP text encoder chosen as text encoder? \n\n3. T2E is benchmarked on small atoms and molecules.
