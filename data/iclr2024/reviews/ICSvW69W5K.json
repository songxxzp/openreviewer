The paper leverages pretrained neural models and tried to narrow down decoding search space by defining IR, type, candidate expressions (whitelisting) to improve semantic parser performance. It goes into details telling the reason why constraint decoding is needed and how it's implemented. Experiment is conducted against KB, and results looks good. The authors put together a complex neural semantic parsing pipeline and proposed a solution for the problem of constrained decoding for non-terminal nodes in structured decoding. On `multi-hop` and `qualifier` test sets, there are decent improvements."

To strengthen the paper, the authors could focus more on novel grammar designs or representations that improve performance.\n\nAdditionally, the experimental validation is limited to a single dataset (KQAPro). Testing the approach on an additional challenging dataset like GrailQA [3] would better verify effectiveness and generalization. With only one dataset, it is hard to determine if the performance gains are dataset-specific or represent a robust advancement for grammar-based decoding. Expanding the experimental evaluation would make the results more convincing.\n\nIn summary, clearly situating the contributions relative to prior grammar-based work and testing across more datasets could help address concerns around novelty and experimental validation. Focusing on where this work provides specific technical innovations or new insights would strengthen the paper. \n\n[1]. A Syntactic Neural Model for General-Purpose Code Generation\n[2].
