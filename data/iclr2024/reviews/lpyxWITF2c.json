The authors start with a setting of homophily dataset where nodes with similar features are more likely connected. As GCN adopts a subgraph/neighbour aggregation, it is not suitable to further magnify such similarity (as input contains more similar features).\n\n-The analytical setting has some strong weakness for it to be practical. For example, it does not consider the effect on model weight.  It is not clear how the proposed result would influence the learning process of GCN and vice versa.\n\n-Missing related work: Jiaqi Ma, Junwei Deng, and Qiaozhu Mei. \"Subgroup generalization and fairness of graph neural networks.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 1048-1061."

Based on the findings, they propose a rewiring algorithm to learn an unbiased typology that is close to the original graph and has a high label homophily coefficient and a low sensitive feature homophily coefficient. Experiments show that the proposed preprocessing rewiring improves fairness when applied to the base GNNs and can be utilized along with other fairness methods to achieve a better fairness-accuracy tradeoff."

Whether the theoretical analysis can generalize to more general cases is unclear.\n\nW3. Clarity can be further improved: The paper organization can be adjusted for a better reading experience.
