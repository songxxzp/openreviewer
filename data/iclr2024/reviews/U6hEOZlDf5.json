Meanwhile, with any modern camera device, one can actually easily capture multiple images as use them as reference. In what scenarios, and why using only one reference image is critical is not mentioned in the paper.\n\n(2) An important component of the method is the 3D reasoning model that learns the 3D volumes from 2D feature maps of two RGB image inputs. However, this is itself a very challenging research topic about open-set 3D volume representation reconstruction with two RGB inputs. It\u2019s difficult to understand why it is possible to obtain reliable 3D representation for an unseen object from only its two views, which may even present large variations in view angle and lighting.
