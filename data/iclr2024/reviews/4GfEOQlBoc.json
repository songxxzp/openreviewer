For any given $D_p(x,\\hat{x})$, it is easy to come up with $\\hat{x}$ to be a counterexample of $S(x,\\hat{x})$, i.e., big ratio corresponding to low human sensitivity and vice versa. For example, the synthesis of $\\hat{x}$ can be performed by the maximum differentiation competition [Wang and Simoncelli] or the perceptual attack [Zhang et al.].\n\n2. The authors should clearly state the meaning of $p(x)$: is it probability density function (PDF) or probability mass function (PMF)? Working with PDF is less reasonable, if the learned distribution is not smooth. \n\n3. Perturbing images with additive uniform noise makes the results in this paper less interesting. Any ideas on the optimal perturbation for the same goal (using probability-related factors to explain/predict human perception)?\n\n4. Parameteric prediction in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) can be trivial and thus meaningless with a deliberately chosen set of $\\hat{\\mathcal{X}}_1$={$\\{\\hat{x}\\}$}. Putting another way, it is not hard to come up with another  $\\hat{\\mathcal{X}}_2$={$\\{\\hat{x}\\}$} to make the parametric prediction nearly impossible.\n\n5. How to apply the computational analysis in the paper? Can the results reflect which quality metrics are better explaining human perception?"

The authors mention this in the discussion as a limitation (that as a proxy for human perception, perceptual metrics were used). However, all of these perceptual metrics are known to be imprecise. Given this, it is overall difficult to know what to take away from the paper. Are the authors actually studying human perception, or are they studying properties of \u201cperceptual distances\u201d that have previously been described? Additionally, the wording throughout the paper should be softened to make it clear that these are just distances measured by a model and not human measurements. \n\nW2: The classical psychophysics experiments are difficult to follow. Perhaps a schematic would help readers understand what is actually being tested in the models? Additionally, the paper states that the classic psychophysics experiments are an \u201cindependent way\u201d to validate the proposed models. I\u2019m not so sure that this is actually independent, as presumably, many of the developed distance measures take into account (either explicitly or implicitly) visual sensitivity based on luminance, contrast, and special frequency. \n\nW3: The authors use a model trained on the CIFAR dataset to get p(x) and then use this for testing, but I\u2019m not sure that this accurately captures relevant properties of human perception (and also whether the distances measures that they are studying are valid on this dataset). Discussion about the distribution mismatch between the datasets that were used to test models of distance measures and the dataset used for training the model used to obtain p(x) might be beneficial."

What are \u201cregions of image space\u201d? Additionally, it seems like there need to be constraints of (1) small perturbations since this is a local measurement and (2) comparing these \u201cregions of image space\u201d only when the ||x-\\tilde(x)||^2 is equal between the two tested regions. Are these necessary? \n\nQ2: In the first sentence of 3.1 the authors use the phrase \u201csensitivities of the metrics\u201d. I think this just means something like \u201chow these metrics change with different probability factors\u201d? The wording is a bit confusing because the paper is studying \u201csensitivities.\" \n\nQ3: Figure 2 is somewhat difficult to interpret. Clearly defining the x and y axes in the figure (rather than in the text) would help the reader. \n\nQ4: Figure 4 y-axis is labeled as \u201cSensitivity\u201d but it would be helpful to explicitly list this as something like \u201cDISTS-derived Sensitivity\u201d.\n\nQ5: The authors state in the discussion that \u201cimages in the subjective experiments usually fall out of the range where you can use the current probability models\u201d. Could the authors spell this out a little more?"

Polynomials can often fit any data so they are not really falsifiable... Here it is true that the authors limit themselves to order 2 polynomials but the decision is only based on fit quality. Is there any reason/motivation to get a second order polynomial beyond fit quality ?\n\n- Here the authors seem to avoid assuming that there is an underlying transduction function proper to an observer. I think this could be a strength but the authors do not mention this and recent relevant literature is not cited (see below). When you assume the existence of a transduction function (that is actually measurable in an observer) and with extra optimal coding assumption you can explicitly derive the relation between the probability density and the perceptual distance. Though this framework is somehow more restricted because it requires assumptions about the nature of the image distortion. In contrast, in the proposed work it should be valid for any distortion (as long as it is small enough) but only adding uniform noise is tested...\n\nExtra-literature : \n- Wei, X. X., & Stocker, A.
