They require only weak labels, which reduces the human time required to assist inadaptation. They show that having some human-generated labeling signal at test time improved performance, which is a very intuitive result as the model is being provided a much more useful signal than it gets without human labels.

Furthermore, the only change to these methods to make them \u201conline\u201d and identical to the proposed method is to assume iteration or additional human labels are allowed to be requested. There is also a large body of work on active learning for domain adaptation that is not covered in the literature and is not clearly a different setting than what the authors propose, particularly when object detectors are being trained (for example https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rse2.200, ). Given this literature, the novelty of the work is a bit more unclear.\n\nIn particular, they do not compare to any alternate active learning or human-in-the-loop benchmarks, which makes in unclear whether their proposed method\u2019s performance increase is fundamentally rooted in the additional labels or is actually tied to something about the method itself. They also do not compare to alternative uses of that human time, which would significantly strengthen the claim that their method is superior in these settings where some human time budget is available."

What is the reason for this gap when human labels are being incorporated? Just the number of training examples with human input? The weak vs strong input? Instead of requiring weak human labels for test frames, how might that human budget be used differently? For instance, providing a strong label for every k frames by correcting the source model detections, where k is set such that the human time is the same? Is it truly better to get a lot of weak labels for adaptations vs a smaller set of strong ones?\n\nThe improvements from the human-in-the-loop adaptation seem small in most cases. How might human time be better accounted for in the metrics or provided as context? What is the value of that human time budget spent on adaptation with class-level supervision for a set of samples vs just spent doing efficient quality control/verification/correction or choosing an operating threshold per-category based on a specific test case? \n\nHow does performance in the \u201conline\u201d setting they propose differ from performance in a 1-shot weakly-supervised adaptation setting, where you would collect k samples and label them (weakly or strongly) and then tune the model on those k samples?
