However, the data selection should be private to both model and data owner in order to keep model parameters and data points private. A technique named MPC can be utilized to jointly evaluate the model privately with forward passes while privacy of both parties could be preserved.  Existing MPC approaches could approximate expensive nonlinearity with cheaper operations for transformer inference, which transformer models are applied in the most deep learning tasks. Meanwhile, they suffers from considerable runtime overhead and poor selection utility. In this work, authors propose an approach to accelerate MPC-based private data selection while preserve the utility of the selection."

The assumption for the unlabeled and probably imbalanced dataset D from data owner is a practical consideration, which makes the work more convincing and challenging than prior related works.\n2. Multiphase selection is a smart strategy. Instead of selecting appropriate data at once. Filtering out most irrelevant data points in the early stage is a way more efficient approach with smaller models and larger models in the later phases provide accurate selection based on filtered data.\n3. Approximation of nonlinear operations with multiple shallow MLPs can simulate the utility of nonlinearity well and reduce high dimensions into much lower dimensions to provide huge efficiency improvement."

It may be more efficient than MPC (not a conclusion and probably interesting for the future investigation).\n2. In the threat model of Section 2.1, can you explain more about what can be revealed (like the purchase budget B mentioned in the Section 4.1) and what should be private (like model parameters and data points)?

                "value": "It seems to lack a clear and precise explanation of the technical aspects of the paper. All the technical details regarding the research method are quite ambiguous, making it difficult to understand the core ideas of the paper. While the paper mentions proposing data selection and appraisal methods when training artificial intelligence models using MPC, it does not precisely explain how these techniques are related to MPC protocols and security. Additionally, it doesn't provide a clear explanation of why each specific technique is necessary and what problems they aim to solve, making it hard to grasp the reasons behind the use of these techniques.\n\nFurthermore, the paper does not offer a clear protocol or source code to understand how each operation is exactly performed. The technical aspects of the paper remain ambiguous, as there is no clear protocol or algorithmic explanation. (I believe that if the protocols and algorithms are given clearly, code submission itself can be considered optional.) The paper lacks explanations for the figures, making it challenging to understand their meanings. \n\nTherefore, I think this paper is not yet ready for presentation at a conference, and a complete rewrite is necessary to clarify each algorithm and protocol and make it more reader-friendly."

How the index with the highest entropy is jointly found.\n4. The definition and details of the QuickSelect algorithm.\n5. The interpretation of Figures 1 and 2.\n6. The role and precise definition of the proxy model.\n7. The dimensions and hyperparameters used for the MLP that replace the nonlinear function.\n8. The data used for proxy model training.\n...\n\nThere are many other unclear aspects that need to be clarified to give the paper more value."
