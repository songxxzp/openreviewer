Experiments are conducted using DSSM and SASRec architectures on three datasets.\n\nThe results show TCF performance generally improves with larger text encoders, indicating limits have not been reached even at 175 billion parameters. However, fine-tuning on the target dataset remains necessary for optimal performance despite massive pre-trained encoders. Comparisons to ID-based CF reveal that while frozen 175B encoders can achieve competitive results on some datasets, fine-tuning is required to consistently surpass IDCF, especially with DSSM.\n\nAdditional experiments demonstrate TCF exhibits some zero-shot transfer ability, but significant gaps remain compared to models adapted to the target data. Overall, the work provides insights into the limits, competitiveness with IDCF, and transferability of TCF models using extremely large language models."

Recommendation system problems are a fundamentally low-rank and high dimensional problem (the number of missing entries is substantially larger than the number of observed entries) so overfitting is a central issue and integrating neural nets (even simple ones) has not been obvious (as the authors also pointed out, many ideas have been proposed/published but few did fair evaluation). So under the context that building a universal foundational model becomes possible, it is intellectually and practically important to ask how the landscape of building recommender systems is changed. The major questions the authors asked include whether the recommender system also exhibits scaling laws, and whether universal representation is possible. The authors further \u201cpartitioned\u201d the questions into smaller, more specific ones that are verifiable/experimentable. The authors\u2019 experiments provide convincing answers to these major questions."

It does not propose a new method, but conducts extensive experimental research on the effect of text encoders of different parameter scales on TCF algorithms. The main conclusions are as follows:\n1. Larger parameter text encoders can continuously improve the performance of TCF, but even at the scale of the OPT-175B model, it is impossible to achieve the ideal universal representation and is still weaker than the fine-tuned small models.\n2. For recommendation scenarios where the main features of the item are text, TCF on the 175B model can achieve a similar performance to the IDCF algorithm and can remove the item ID feature without losing the recommendation effect.\n3. Even with the universal item ID feature, due to the possible differences in the matching relationship between users and items in different recommendation applications, the performance of directly transferring the matching model of a certain domain to other domains in a zero-shot manner is still poor."
