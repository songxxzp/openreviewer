They show that this approach can significantly outperform doing only selective prediction, and also show that it can outperform selection and recalibration done in sequence."

While S-TLBCE seems like a new objective in this context, it does not perform better (in fact it even performs worse on ImageNet) than the jointly optimized version of S-MMCE from [1], except for the OOD tests on CIFAR-100-C. Furthermore, the table describing these latter experiments (Table 1) is unclear - the description claims to be reporting AUC over various coverage levels but only ECE-1 and ECE-2 are reported? Also, the naive confidence-based rejection strategy (which should be described in the main paper) performs very well on the ImageNet/Camelyon17 experiments - the authors say that this strategy falls apart in the OOD case, but is this considering confidence-based rejection with recalibration (in sequence)? \n\n## Recommendation\nOverall I think the paper is tackling an interesting and relatively new problem, but I feel the contribution is too marginal in its current form to warrant a clear acceptance. Furthermore, the experimental results do not seem to me to be convincingly better than the previous work of [1], and for this reason I recommend **weak reject**.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12084"

Reliable confidence estimation is a key property for predictors operating in sensitive domains, but is not typically easy to achieve. Selective calibration combines \"selective prediction\" (i.e., allowing for abstention) with \"calibration\", in the sense that selectively calibrated predictors prioritize having calibrated predictions on the non-rejected population of inputs. Previous work by Fisch et. al. (2022) only considered optimizing the \"selection\" part given a fixed model. This paper follows the natural motivation of also training a recalibrator jointly, which is similar to previous work in standard selective classification such as SelectiveNet (Geifman and El-Yaniv, 2019). It is intuitive to see why such an approach would be a good idea for some input distributions and models (e.g., where the optimal calibrator across the full input space is not in the sigmoid family for Platt scaling, but is after selection).

More broadly, I would have been excited to see a more nuanced approach to selective calibration (which Fisch et. al. also misses), in the sense that not all types of calibration error are necessarily equal. For example, under a selective recalibration framework, all of the following example rejections would be preferred (assuming that they don't have any other structure that makes recalibration easier post selection):\n\n- reject(Predictions with confidence 95% but accuracy 90%) > reject(predictions with confidence 4% but accuracy 0%)\n- reject(Predictions with confidence 80% but accuracy 100%) > reject(predictions with confidence 80% but accuracy 61%)\n\nObviously it depends on the application, but generally speaking it seems that rejecting the top-performing half of predictions simply because their confidences are slightly too high is not a useful strategy. Similarly for under- vs. over-confidence. Considering other calibration objectives (e.g., Decision Calibration from Zhao et. al., 2021) that are more expressive than ECE-1/ECE-2 could add significantly to this work's potential impact. \n\nI'm also a bit worried about the data requirement for selective recalibration to work. If labeled examples from the target domain are not available (e.g., following the setting of Fisch et. al.), can the method still produce reliable rejections? Does recalibration on the training domain help here?\n\nMinor formatting points:\n- It would be helpful to keep equation numbering for all display equations.\n- Unnumbered equation for $h^\\mathrm{Temp}$ would benefit from \\left \\right parentheses.\n\n[3] Calibrating Predictions to Decisions: A Novel Approach to Multi-Class Calibration.

The caption could use some additional clarification. For example, what is the desired coverage level? It seems like the basic strategy that is followed is to reject either the blue or the green (selective vs. selective recalibration, respectively). Though I would still expect a selective only approach to reject the mid-confidence blue examples disproportionately more than the upper/lower ranges (since this is where calibration error is highest per the reliability diagram).\n\n- It makes sense that jointly learning selection and recalibration can help when the calibration error is too complex to be fit by the family of recalibration functions specified by Platt or temperature scaling. I'd be curious to see how this would compare to simply fitting a slightly more expressive family of calibrators (e.g., 2-layer NN), especially for data without distribution shifts.\n\n- This is more of a half-baked suggestion than a question, but I'm curious if the authors ever experimented with the following setup. Suppose we modeled recalibration as a hard mixture of experts, where $h(x) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} g_i(x) h_i(x)$ with $g(x)$ being 1-hot. On new distributions $p(x')$, one could \"turn off\" the lowest performing $g_i$ via rejection until $\\sum_{i \\in \\text{rejected}} \\mathbb{E}(g_i(x')) = \\beta$. This is a generalization of the current setup with $g(x)$ being binary, and only training one $h(x)$ (as the other examples are discarded). On new distributions, however, dynamically reconfiguring this mixture (which will have been trained to fit subdomains in the training data) could prove to be effective, without the need for much new data to jointly recalibrate $h$."

Platt scaling and temperature scaling, the calibration methods used in the experiments, have very few parameters, and discretization-based approaches are also very simple. The argument in the submission is that selective calibration can be beneficial because it may not be possible to achieve good fit for the calibration model to the entire data. However, an obvious approach to tackle this problem is to simply make the calibration model more complex: rather than using a linear logistic regression model as in Platt scaling, one can use a multi-layer perceptron instead.\n\nI am also wondering about the sequential baseline used. A single epoch of calibration is performed before the selection model is trained. It is unclear why a single epoch is used. Also, it seems that improved performance could trivially be obtained by recalibrating again after the selection model has been trained. (This could be iterated, but that would probably be very similar to joint optimisation using gradient descent.)\n\nNo significance testing is performed and no confidence intervals are provided for estimated performance measures.\n\nThe first result in Section C.2 is disturbing: classification accuracy goes down with decreased coverage when applying the proposed method. It is unclear to me whether one would ever accept this in practical applications.\n\nOther comments and typos:\n\n\"whether an instance is correctly classifier\"                                   \n                                                                                \n\"outputs, We\"                                                                   \n                                                                                \nSection B.2.1: what is $\\tilde f$?                                              \n                                                                                \nSection B.4.2 does not mention validation data."
