A weighted replay buffer is used to represent the state-action distribution induced by the ensemble, allowing for training using the entire collected data. The algorithm is evaluated on state-based and pixel-based environments from the DeepMind Control Suite and outperforms existing methods in terms of sample efficiency and performance.

This approach is unique and different from existing methods in the field. The use of boosting in the context of AIL is a creative combination of ideas that brings new insights and potential benefits.\n\n2. The paper provides a thorough and well-structured description of the AILBoost algorithm, including the theoretical foundations, algorithmic details, and empirical evaluation. The authors present a clear motivation for their approach and provide a comprehensive analysis of its performance compared to existing methods. The empirical evaluation is conducted on a benchmark suite of environments, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of AILBoost.\n\n3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors provide clear explanations of the concepts, algorithms, and experimental setup. The organization of the paper is logical, with sections dedicated to preliminaries, algorithm description, and experimental results. The use of figures and tables further enhances the clarity of the presentation.\n\n4. The paper addresses important limitations in existing adversarial imitation learning methods, particularly in terms of off-policy training and sample efficiency. By introducing AILBoost, the authors provide a principled and effective solution that improves the performance and scalability of AIL algorithms.

While the paper compares AILBoost with existing off-policy AIL algorithms such as DAC, ValueDICE, and IQ-Learn, it would be beneficial to include a comparison with more state-of-the-art IL methods as well. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation and demonstrate how AILBoost performs relative to the best-performing IL algorithms in the field.\n\n2. The paper lacks a detailed theoretical analysis of the AILBoost algorithm. While the authors provide some intuition and connections to boosting algorithms, a more rigorous theoretical analysis would strengthen the paper's claims. Specifically, providing formal proofs or guarantees of convergence, optimality, or sample complexity would enhance the theoretical foundation of AILBoost.\n\n3. The paper briefly mentions the hyperparameters used in the experiments but does not provide a thorough discussion on their selection or sensitivity analysis. It would be valuable to explore the impact of different hyperparameter choices on the performance of AILBoost and provide insights into the robustness and generalizability of the algorithm.\n\n4. The paper does not include ablation studies to analyze the individual components or design choices of AILBoost. By systematically removing or modifying specific components of the algorithm and evaluating their impact on performance, the authors could gain a deeper understanding of the contributions of each component and provide insights into their importance.\n\n5. The paper briefly mentions that AILBoost may have increased memory cost due to maintaining weak learners. However, a more comprehensive discussion on the limitations of AILBoost, such as computational complexity, scalability to larger environments, or potential failure modes, would provide a more balanced perspective on the algorithm's practical applicability."

In Section 4, you mention that AILBoost maintains a weighted replay buffer to represent the state-action distribution induced by the ensemble. Could you provide more details on how the weights are computed and updated in the replay buffer? Additionally, how does the size of the replay buffer affect the performance of AILBoost? It would be helpful to understand the trade-off between memory usage and performance.\n\n3. The paper mentions that AILBoost achieves competitive performance with as little as one expert trajectory. Could you provide more insights into the limitations and trade-offs of using a small number of expert demonstrations? How does the performance of AILBoost change as the number of expert trajectories increases? It would be interesting to see if there is a threshold or diminishing returns in terms of performance improvement with more expert demonstrations.\n\n4. In the experimental evaluation, you compare AILBoost with existing off-policy AIL algorithms. Could you provide more insights into the reasons behind the superior performance of AILBoost compared to these baselines?

Could you point out the exact theorem that makes this claim?\n\n3.Can I get a definition for \"off-policy\"? I believe the proposed algorithm is still \"on-policy\" as it compares the current mixed policy state distribution to the expert's.\n\n4.The noise during the policy rollout each round might compound via the buffer replay and disrupt the analysis on the discriminator's side. If this is the case and we need to gather new samples from the mixed policy every round, does this challenge the claim of being fully off-policy?\n\n5. It would be interesting to see experiments where the learner is truly weaker than the expert, such that the expert is nonrealizable. Is weak learnability in imitation learning sufficient for near-expert performance?\n\n6.In Algorithm 2, why do we calculate $\\pi_{t+1}$ without the expert dataset? Is this practical? Any further justification?\n\n7.Why in Algorithm 2, line 10, is the replay buffer given uniform weight for all samples? Any further justification?\n\n8.Could you explain more about the meaning of 1000 policy updates per 100 discriminator updates in section 5.3?\n\n9. As a follow up question from question 1, I believe the returned mixed policy is following the online reduction similar to DAgger[1], among DAgger style algorithms, MoBIL[2] is also using weighted policies, which may be worth mentioning.\n\nMinor suggestions:\n\nPlease mention \"10 trajectories\" in the caption of Figure 3.\nPlease provide more description on the performance of behavior cloning in Figure 3.\nCan you provide each task's plots corresponding to Figure 1 in the appendix?

One example I could think is adding a small figure to describe AILBoost's contribution, but this is not a mandatory comment to follow.\n- There are two different forms of reverse KLD; (1) Donsker-Varadhan dual form from ValueDICE (2) Variational form from f-divergence GAIL. In AILBoost, the second form was used. Do we have any reason for not using the first form?\n- The idea of using weighted replay buffer and boosting seems applicable to general AIL frameworks, although authors applied this only to the variational form of reverse KLD. Can we apply this idea to DAC, and if possible, can we see the performance for those cases? One reason I'm asking is the training procedure that combines DAC with boosting may be simpler than the one with rev KLD.\n- In page 7, line 1, \"we always warm start from $\\pi_t$\". ---> What does this mean? Also, Appendix A doesn't appear in the manuscript. \n- AILBoost's computational complexity increases as $t$ increases in Algorithm 1. Can you please compare training times among DAC, ValueDICE and AILBoost?\n- In Figure 1, \"AILBoost outperforms DAC, ValueDICE, IQ-Learn, and BC across all metrics, amount of expert demonstrations, and tasks\" ---> This is true from IQM perspective, but not true when 1 demonstration is considered with Mean and Optimality Gap. \n- Figure 2,3,4's file sizes seem to be too large, which I think end up the heavy file size (34MB) of pdf file and makes text loading slow. Can we make those figures' sizes smaller?"
