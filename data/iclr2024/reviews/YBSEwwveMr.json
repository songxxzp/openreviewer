                "value": "- To me it is unclear why the score-matching model would lead to a coherent shared latent space, and I would appreciate if authors would clarify that. While in the first step of training we have a prior $p(z_{1:M})=\\prod \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma I)$, what are the modelling assumptions on the parametric prior $p_{\\theta}(z_{1:M})$ in the second step?\n- The comparison with MVTCAE [2] from e.g. Figures 4 and 5 is quite important and should be further commented, with maybe more insights (eg. different $\\beta$ values, average performance across modalities for conditional generation, see below) for at least two reasons. First as it does not sub-sample modalities during training, MVTCAE is not subject to the limitations for generative quality uncovered in [1]. Second, MVTCAE and the proposed model are really similar in performance, and from the results it is unclear which one performs better overall (at least in the first experimental setting). \n- Why reporting only the results on the last modality in e.g. Figure 4? (Even though also results on the first modality are available, in the Appendix).This is only a partial insight on model performance, and results should be averaged across modalities for conditional generation (not modalities used for inference, modalities used for generation) to show performance is consistently good. To back up this point, results on the third modality (Figure 3) indicate that MVTCAE has poor generative quality. However, FIDs in Figure 4 for the last modality indicate otherwise. Hence, it seems that in evaluating model performance, one might want to control for the effect of choice of modality.  \n- Did the authors do an ablation for different values of $\\beta$ for the compared models in e.g. Extended PolyMNIST? In the Appendix it is stated that the $\\beta$ was chosen using the validation set. How exactly was it chosen? Should it be by looking at the ELBO value on the validation set, one should be careful as likelihood values prove often not to be representative when it comes to performance of multimodal VAEs. For instance, with models that subsample modalities, high likelihoods for conditional reconstruction across modalities can be obtained by producing average-looking samples (since the modality-specific information about the sample to be reconstructed cannot be inferred). I think it would be important to report results for the compared models across $\\beta$ values instead of reporting results only for a single value. To back up this point, the conditional generation results from Figure 3 for e.g. MVTCAE seem rather different from what reported original work [2] on PolyMNIST, in which the authors use a much higher $\\beta$ value ($\\beta=2.5$ I think).  \n- I found many typos and imprecisions in the manuscript, that has margin for improvement in writing quality. \n\n[1] Daunhawer I, Sutter TM, Chin-Cheong K, Palumbo E, and Vogt JE.

On the other hand, conditional modality gain refers to test-time conditional generation performance improving when more modalities are given for inference.

They devise a method to learn a shared prior for the latent variables that represent different modalities, in order to understand the interconnections between them. Each modality's training is optimized through the maximization of its Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). The latent variables for each modality are then independently generated using the unimodal encoders. These variables are jointly modeled using a denoising score-matching technique. Additionally, the latent variables are trained to be consistent with each other through a noise-contrastive approach, and the gradient of the noise-contrastive model is used to adjust the scores for latent variables that are not observed.\n\nUsing their proposed method, the authors demonstrate that the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of the created outputs remains stable, even as the number of modalities grows. Moreover, the congruence between the modalities, measured by how accurately the class label of the anticipated modality can be predicted, is enhanced when the model includes a mechanism for coherence guidance."
