The authors demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of G-Patch in achieving universal targeted attacks on ViTs, even in challenging conditions. The experiments show that G-Patch can be deployed in black box attacks and in real-world scenarios. The paper makes several contributions by introducing a new model for generating adversarial patches for ViTs, demonstrating the robustness of G-Patch to various challenges, and showing its effectiveness in black box and physical-world attacks."

However, from the actual visual results (in the cases of physical experiments), I don't find it to be very imperceptible. Furthermore, the author claims that the method has strong robustness against brightness constraints, color transfer, and random noise, yet these experiments lack comparative baselines.\n\nLack of ablation studies and comparative baselines: Although this method is an adversarial patch for the ViT architecture, the experiments lack comparisons with state-of-the-art adversarial patch methods. Additionally, there is a lack of ablation analysis, such as the impact of changes in the generator architecture.\n\n[1] Perceptual-sensitive gan for generating adversarial patches In AAAI\n[2] Generative dynamic patch attack.
