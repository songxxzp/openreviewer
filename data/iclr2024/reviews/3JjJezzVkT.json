Practically, momentum is often used with SGD (as GD is expensive in practical machine learning optimization). In the presence of gradient noise, will momentum still offer benefits? This is the central question studied in this work. \n\nFirst, this work presents a theory, showing that when the learning rate tends to zero, the trajectories of SGD and SGDM are close in two regimes. The first regime is when the gradient noise is large (with $O(1/\\eta)$ variance) but the total running distance is constant. The second regime allows the total running steps to be large but requires an overparameterized model where the global solutions form a manifold. \n\nSecond, this work conducts experiments to verify that for both training and test, SGDM and SGD are close when the learning rate is small and when the batch size is not too large. \n\nThe writing is clear overall. Some places require clarifications. See more in the next section. \n\nI did not check the proof."

                "value": "1. I feel the introduction/motivation could use some polishment. Specifically, the benefit of momentum is for stabilizing GD with a large learning rate ($>2/L$, in terms of improving the minimax convergence rate for (strongly convex) smooth optimization) as discussed in the first paragraph of the introduction. However, I did not recall a theoretical result that claims acceleration of momentum for GD with a learning rate. \n\nOne of the main contributions of this paper is to show that momentum does not change SGD trajectory much when the learning rate is sufficiently small. Therefore, momentum is not very helpful. \n\nI am not sure how surprising this is, since the benefit of momentum is only claimed for GD with a very large learning rate. \n\nAlso, the condition that $1-\\\\beta\\^{(n)}_k = \\\\Theta ((\\\\eta^{(n)})\\^{\\\\alpha} )$ (in definition 3.1) for $\\alpha \\in [0,1)$ (in Theorem 3.5) basically says that the history gradient will be forgotten fast (in a nearly exponential rate) when SGDM runs $\\\\Theta(1/\\\\eta)$ steps. So it's not very surprising that SGDM will be close to SGD. \n\n\n2. In the last paragraph of Section 3, the paper briefly mentions a phenomenon for $\\\\alpha>1$. However, the theorem only covers $\\\\alpha <1$. Could the author elaborate on what happens to SGDM when $\\\\alpha>1$?\n\n\n3. In the paragraph after Lemma 2.4, $\\\\sigma$ is set to be $1/\\sqrt{\\eta}$ to ensure a non-trivial gradient noise scaling. However, later in Theorem 3.5, it allows that $\\\\sigma \\le \\eta^{-1/2}$, and in Theorem 4.5, it allows $\\\\alpha = \\\\Theta(1)$. These seem to be different from the prior discussions. Could the authors clarify the scaling of the noise?  In particular, can Theorem 3.5 be applied to GD and GDM (i.e., $\\\\sigma = 0$)?\n\n\n4. This paper mentions two versions of SGDM, that is, eq (1) used in practice and eq (3) used in theory. I appreciate the usage of $\\\\gamma$ and $\\\\eta$ to differentiate the learning rate for those two versions, which helps highlight the difference in the effective optimization length. \n\nIn the ImageNet experiment, the learning rate for eq (1) is manually rescaled when compared to SGD (to align with the theory setup in eq (3)), which is good. However, for training ResNet-32 on CIFAR-10, the paper writes that \"We first grid search to find the best learning\nrate for the standard SGDM ($\\\\ell=1$), and then we perform SGD and SGDM with that same learning rate for different levels of $\\\\ell$\". I am wondering if the learning rate for SGD needs a rescaling here."

Additionally, similar to previous studies, they construct a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) for the continuous version of SGDM/SGD and, through an analysis of the SDE's limiting behavior, reveal that both SGD and SGDM exhibit a similar implicit bias."

If the paper could establish conditions where, for certain small learning rates, SGDM and SGD consistently approximate each other, it would offer broader insights into the relationship between these methods and provide more guidance on when to expect their similarities.
