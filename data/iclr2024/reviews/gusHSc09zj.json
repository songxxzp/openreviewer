                "value": "**1. Notations and explanations**\n\n1.1 The SCM described in equation (1) differs from equation (6) and also the equation below equation (6); which one is correct? Do you assume additive noise?\n\n1.2 In Theorem 1 equation (*), what is the definition of $a_i$? Does it mean one sample from $i$th SCM?\n\n1.3 In Theorem 1, what are $g_1$ and $g_2$? Should they be $h_1$ and $h_2$?\n\n1.4 As mentioned in the main paper, \"This highlights the idea that learning a mixture model is only beneficial when the underlying SCMs differ from one another significantly. \" could you clarify what the significant difference is here?\n\n**2. Details in the experiment**\n\n2.1 In the experiment section, \"(per sample) indicates that the baseline predicts one graph per sample.\" how to apply the algorithm with only one sample? For example, PCMCI$^{+}$ needs CI tests, and CI tests need a set of samples instead of only one sample.\n\n2.2 In the experiment performance section, AUROC and F1 are used as metrics. However, it is not mentioned which kind of AUROC and F1 refer to adjacency or orientation AUROC/F1?\n\n2.3 As far as I know, the Rhino algorithm is not designed for heterogeneous time series data. In the experimental section, would it be feasible to compare the proposed algorithm with \"Rhino (grouped)\" as well? This would involve applying the Rhino algorithm to the grouped data based on the true underlying causal graph. Considering this, the results regarding Rhino in Figures 3 and 6 could be more comprehensive if grouped data were utilized.\n\n2.4 Could the post-processing of PCMCI$^{+}$ outputs potentially affect the AUROC/F1 scores of PCMCI$^{+}$? If it does, would this influence tend to favor the proposed method in the comparison results?\n\n2.5 In the synthetic data experiment, the metrics are averaged across 3 runs. Does each run requires a newly generated synthetic dataset? Personally, 3 runs seem to be a limited number for comprehensive evaluation.\n\n2.6 In Figure 3, it seems a little strange that the performance of PCMCI$^{+}$ (grouped) is better with $D=10$ than with $D=5$. The same phenomenon happened in other algorithms. Do you have any clue on why this happened?\n\n2.7 In Figure 4, \"The accuracy is averaged across 3 runs and across data dimensionality D = 5, 10, 20.\", is it more appropriate to plot the results for $D=5,10,20$ separately as the value of $D$ could affect the accuracy? Again, 3 runs seem limited to me.\n\n2.8 Could you explain more about \"The clustering accuracy and performance metrics show high standard deviation when K is set to the true number of mixture components K* = 10.\" which is stated in the appendix and explain more about the \"buffers\" when $K>K^{*}$?\n\n**3. Other questions**\n\n3.1 Why maximizing ELBO is equivalent to maximizing or minimizing each term separately in the log-likelihood in terms of $\\theta, \\phi$, and $\\psi$ as $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ appear together in the second term?\n\n3.2 Is it better to mention the Rhino algorithm in the related work section and briefly explain how it works as the proposed algorithm is built on top of Rhino?\n\n3.3 Is it essential to verify whether the data satisfies condition (*) to ensure the reliability of the results? If so, how to verify this?\n\n3.4 The paper mentions that people can also infer functional equations through the proposed model. Could you help me locate the related outputs in the experiment section? Does this mean the causal effect?\n\n3.5 Has any code been provided?"

In fact, analyzing it as i.i.d. often yields better results than analyzing it as time series, frustratingly, as in this paper: \n\nMulti-subject search correctly identifies causal connections and most causal directions in the DCM models of the Smith et al. simulation study. NeuroImage, 58(3), 838-848. \n\nThis paper also treats the distributions as a mixture, though doesn't assume non-i.i.d.\n\n3.\tAs a result, it seems that any study proposing a time series analysis of this data should do a comparison of this result to one obtained by treating the data as i.i.d. instead, since this is a known phenomenon for this particular dataset. This is an issue because the proposed method is specifically designed to deal with time series.\n4.\tThe problem with the DREAM3 examples is that none of the reported results have any lift with AUC; they\u2019re all stuck around 0.5, which is more or less random.
