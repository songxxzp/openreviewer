This idea leads to a better approximation of heavy-tailed densities, which is confirmed by experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The presented (solid) theoretical justification stems from viewing classical VAE as a joint minimization process between two statistical manifolds and relies on replacing the KL divergence with the $\\gamma$-power divergence."

They argue that this new formulation can better fit real-world datasets.  Empirical results suggest that t3VAE performs better in modeling low-density regions, and yields superior performance on the CelebA and imbalanced CIFAR-100 datasets."

While intuitively, adopting the \u03b3-power divergence to the KL-divergence might seem appropriate, a central question arises: Does the \u03b3-power divergence between the two manifolds still lead to the ELBO? This needs to be addressed for better clarity.\n\n- Given that both t3VAE and the Student-t VAE integrate the Student's t-distribution into the VAE framework, a more granular comparison in the related work section would be enlightening. Highlighting the distinct features and advantages of t3VAE over the Student-t VAE would give readers a clearer understanding of its contributions.\n\n-  I noticed that the hierarchical variants of the model weren't evaluated in the experimental section. Such an evaluation might provide insights into the model's performance in different configurations. I'd be keen to see these results.\n\n- Incorporating the Student's t-distributions inherently increases the model's complexity. This can potentially introduce challenges in training and optimization. I recommend the authors delve into these potential challenges, discussing potential remedies and considerations for practitioners aiming to implement t3VAE."

The authors draw upon the EM perspective of VAEs developed by Han et al., 2021 to formulate a joint minimization objective, and use ideas from information geometry to tie together the exponent in the power divergence with the degrees of freedom in the t-distributions. The degrees of freedom hyperparameter is shown to affect the degree of regularization in the model. The model formulation is also described in terms of a Bayesian point of view. Four experiments are conducted comparing the performance of the proposed model with a selection of other competing VAEs: the first involving a univariate synthetic dataset (reporting histograms and MMD test p-values), the second involving a bivariate synthetic dataset (reporting MMD test p-values), the third involving the CelebA image dataset (reporting FID scores), and the fourth involving the CIFAR100-LT image dataset (reporting FID scores). In all cases, the model is shown to vastly outperform competing methods. All arguments are supported with ample theoretical derivations in the supplementary material."
