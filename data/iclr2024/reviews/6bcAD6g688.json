                "value": "This paper investigates the problem of label errors in the context of harmful content and toxicity detection. The paper adopts corrupted learning methods which aim to identify mislabeled dataset examples based on example similarity in feature space. The paper evaluates the proposed methods using five existing toxicity datasets (Jigsaw Civil Comments, PKU BeaverTails, PKU SafeRLHF, Anthropic Harmless, and Anthropic Red-Team). Experimental results show that their method is effective at detecting erroneously labeled examples, showing that almost 70% of the detected labels are actually mislabeled as verified by human annotators. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that the proposed method yields a cost reduction of around 90% w.r.t. finding label errors using human annotators. The paper furthermore shows that fine-tuning models on cleaned datasets leads to superior performances as compared to fine-tuning on the original ones."

Given that labeling according to harmfulness and toxicity can lead to ambiguities and disagreements between annotators, it would be important to have each potentially mislabeled example assessed by multiple annotators and report agreements between annotators. If each example has been rated by multiple annotators, it would be important to provide the agreement rates."

Result on showing increase credibility doesn't seem credible (pun intended) in that there is no external validation, just that applying the algorithm improves their own formulation.  This is a good sanity check but not evidence of effectiveness.\n\nW2. The use of Anthropic's Harmless dataset which is a pairwise dataset and then using them as pointwise labels seems artificially bad.  It would be more interesting to consider how to detect when the pairwise ranking is wrong (which would still be an important error to catch).\n\nW3. In \"Answer to RQ1\" and RQ2, the metrics here confusing, as the approach to sampling examples results in not measuring recall or precision.  I think these labels could be reworked to fit those metrics but would take a little work and more information (trigger rate).  RQ2 seems to make a similar confusion by trying to compute recall based on a sample from where the algorithm predictd it was mislabeled, which I believe is backwards.\n\nW4. The methodology seems to depend heavily on the embedding approach, the task complexity, and the datasets.  It'd be nice to see the work tested on newer, higher powered models as both BERT and GPT2 are relatively old at this point.  For example, does using embeddings from BERT still provide benefit on a more powerful model like GPT-3.5 acting as the classifier?  The reason this is a concern would be if the embedding is less powerful than the reasoning abilities of a larger model, it may effectively regularize toward simpler heuristics of what should have the same label than what a more powerful model understands.  I don't think this is critical for publication but would make the paper more impactful.\n\n------\nThe authors rebuttal sufficiently addressed many of these concerns and so I have revised my score below."
