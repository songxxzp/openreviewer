In fact, in the experiment, authors only use 100 simulated graphs with 30-nodes in the training data. By no means this model would work well for all causal discovery settings.\n  - And we can hardly get other useful information beyond the inferred graph. To be specific, for a constraint-based method, one can conclude that the absence of an edge between $X$ and $Y$ is because they are (conditionally) independent. For a score based method, the obtained graph has the best score (under some score function and possibly other assumptions) among all searched graphs. However, for the proposed method, there is no such information at all. \n  - The pairwise representation used in this method may be beneficial, but it takes $d^2h$ -dim where $d$ is the number of nodes. If we have a 100-node problem and each original feature has $h=4$ dim, this would be $40,000$-dim feature. I think this design would limit the scalability of the problem. Please clarify.\n- The experiments are not convincing: \n  - lacking some important setup details: e.g., how are \"general nonlinear data\" generated  and what nonlinearity is used? what is the average degree of the graph? Also, why GES cannot finish in 24 hours for a 30-node problem?\n  - lacking completive benchmark method: there are many other methods that are empirically good, like GraN-DAG, RL-BIC, NOTEARS-ML. Even though they return only a DAG, one can convert this DAG to its CPDAG and check how good the CPDAG is. Note that GOLEM has specially designed a score function for linear-Gaussian data with nonequal variances. Please also give a try.\n  - important results were omitted: Existing works have better estimation results on Sachs data. For example, the method CSIvA has reported SHDs 5 and 6 on this dataset, while the proposed method has SHD=10. Of course, a method does not need to beat all the rest on all settings, but giving such results can be very informative for readers. \n\n### Minor Concerns\n\n- \"Deep Neural Network (DNN) based SCL, which learns DNNs as causal models, has gained significant attention with its numerous advantages\"--- I think here this type of methods is overclaimed; see the above of my perspective on such methods. Please revise.\n- Since the paper considers transformer based NN model with sampling methods to generate a causal graph, some previous works earlier than CSIvA shall be discussed, as they also use transformer model and/or Bernoulli sampling , like below.\n  - [1] causal discovery with reinforcement learning, ICLR 2020\n  - [2]  Neural Causal Structure Discovery from Interventions\n\n- I am not very convinced by the \"Risk of Bernoulli-sampling adjacency matrix approach\". The reasoning is that edge orientation is done by Bernoulli sampling and may cause as inconsistency problem. However, if we follow the same reasoning, the v-structure in the proposed method is also determined by \"logit\" and may yield a wrong decision as well.\n\n\n\nOverall,  while the paper proposes an improved method over CSIvA , the technical contribution is weak, there is no guarantee or other useful information of inferred graph, and the experiments are not convincing. I recommend REJ for the current version."

                "value": "My main concerns are as follows:\n\n1) Theoretical guarantees: The problem setting appears unconventional to me. Specifically, I'm interested in understanding how the proposed method can theoretically establish its ability to identify true causal structures. From my understanding, the identifiability of general causal structures from observational data typically hinges on specific assumptions, such as model assumptions like linear non-Gaussian or additive noise models for nonlinear causal discovery. These assumptions play a crucial role in both the data generative process and the methods employed. How do the proposed networks align with such assumptions to ensure their capacity for identifiability? Although the proposed method primarily targets the identification of Markov equivalence classes, it is essential to understand how the proposed networks integrate independent tests into the training process.\n\n2) The motivation also appears to have certain issues. For instance, the motivation that using the Bernoulli-sampling adjacency matrix as a learning target can produce inconsistent results raises concerns. To substantiate this, in Section 4.3.1, an example is provided involving two datasets generated by two distinct linear Gaussian models. In this context, I believe that the non-identifiability result is a consequence of model assumptions, specifically the fact that linear non-Gaussian models are not identifiable (with unequal variances), rather than being directly attributed to the use of Bernoulli sampling.\n\n3) The experiments appear to be concentrated on specific non-identifiable scenarios, such as linear Gaussian models or general nonlinear models. It raises the question of why the authors have not included experiments in identifiable cases, like linear non-Gaussian models. I would like to recommend the addition of more experiments in these identifiable cases to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.\n\nOverall, I think that significant improvements are necessary to enhance the clarity of theroblem setting and motivation."
