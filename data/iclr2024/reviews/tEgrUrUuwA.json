There are some reservations regarding the novelty of this paper for the following reasons:\n\n     a) The issues of label imbalance and homophily-heterophily have been effectively addressed in the past. Notably, Tang et al. [1] offered a theoretical explanation for these concerns using spectral graph analysis.\n     \n     b) Building upon the findings of [1], this paper makes incremental enhancements in the field of fraud detection while questioning the complexity of earlier algorithms. Nonetheless, this paper does not provide comprehensive comparison of time and space complexities with previous works.\n\n2. The approach of treating fraud detection as a binary classification problem has inherent limitations. Real-world scenarios often involve anomalies that cannot be neatly classified into a single class and that do not adhere to clustering assumptions. Given the multitude of existing papers that have already presented effective solutions to address the challenges of imbalance and homophily-heterophily by binary classification algorithms, it raises questions about the need for publishing similar articles at the cutting-edge conference ICLR.\n\n3. An analysis about the labeled neighborhoods\u2019 label distributions of central nodes in the training dataset is necessary. This is crucial as the proposed method relies heavily on the labels of neighboring nodes. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize the ratio of normal nodes to anomaly nodes in the training data.\n\n4. Concerns have been raised about the correctness of equation (7).\n\n[1] Tang, Jianheng, et al. Rethinking graph neural networks for anomaly detection. ICML, 2022."

Existing GNN-based GFD models modify graph structures to accommodate GNNs' homophilic bias by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing. However, the authors propose a novel perspective: instead of excluding, they advocate for distinguishing neighbors with different labels. They introduce a method called Partitioning Message Passing (PMP), a message passing paradigm tailored for GFD. In PMP, neighbors with different classes are aggregated using distinct node-specific aggregation functions. This approach allows the central node to adaptively adjust the information gathered from both heterophilic and homophilic neighbors. By doing so, PMP prevents the model gradient from being dominated by benign nodes, which constitute the majority of the population. The authors establish a theoretical connection between the spatial formulation of PMP and spectral analysis, characterizing PMP as an adaptive node-specific spectral graph filter. This demonstrates PMP's ability to handle graphs with mixed heterophily and homophily. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PMP, showing significant performance improvements in Graph Fraud Detection tasks. PMP's innovative approach of distinguishing rather than excluding neighbors with different labels showcases its potential in enhancing the capabilities of GNNs for fraud detection on graphs."
