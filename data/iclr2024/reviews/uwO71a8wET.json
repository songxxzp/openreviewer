                "value": "This paper presents a Bayesian Controlled Neural Differential Equations (BNCDE) framework aimed at estimating treatment effects in time-series data within a continuous time. The approach involves employing a Bayesian Neural Network to model the drift function of the CDE, with the posterior distribution of the neural network weights defined by the solution of a stochastic differential equation.\nThe authors outline a training regimen for the framework by optimizating the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) in an end-to-end manner. \nOn the empirical side, the author includes experiments conducted on synthetic tumor growth data, with a focus on evaluating the uncertainty estimation quality of the proposed model. The results from these experiments are compared to non-Bayesian counterparts, highlighting the performance differences between the two approaches."

                "value": "There are two aspects that warrant further discussion, particularly in terms of its novelty and scalability. With respect to novelty, it appears that the main formulations of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) and Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) are derived from prior works, and the variational inference methods employed are consistent with those utilized in existing latent SDE literature [1]. This gives an impression that the current work may be an amalgamation of these previous methodologies, adapted to extend the CDE framework. Furthermore, there are noticeable similarities between this work and [2]. Despite the authors\u2019 footnote indicating a substantial divergence from [2], there is a potential for their framework to be adaptable for time series treatment and to incorporate CDE elements. A more comprehensive discussion of the distinctions between the current work and [2] could enhance the clarity on this matter.\n\nIn terms of scalability, the neural network weights are modeled through an SDE with a neural network drift function. This configuration implies that the input dimensionality of the SDE drift scales with the dimensionality of the weights, which could potentially escalate to millions. This raises pertinent questions regarding the computational cost and the stability of the training process under such high-dimensional circumstances. An exploration of these aspects would contribute to a more thorough understanding of the framework\u2019s practical applicability and limitations.\n\n[1] Li, Xuechen, et al. \"Scalable gradients for stochastic differential equations.\" International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics.

Since the potential outcome is modelled through the latent embeddings, does this affect the identifiability?\n\n3. The prediction also estimate the outcome uncertainty. But typically, this can potential lead to the a naive model with large uncertainty. I wonder the quantification quality for the aleatoric uncertainty."

In this regard, an unblocked path will open from $Y_t$ and $Y_{t'}$.
