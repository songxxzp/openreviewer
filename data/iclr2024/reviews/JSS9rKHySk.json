So it is exciting to see that the authors are trying to fill the gap.\n\nHowever, the current version is still not ready for publication due to the writing quality and since the relationships to previous works are not clear. \n\n[1] Offline reinforcement learning: Fundamental barriers for value function approximation\n[2] Offline reinforcement learning with realizability and single-policy concentrability\n[3] When is realizability sufficient for off-policy reinforcement learning?"

The authors state many things without concrete examples and arguments but only abstract summarizations (by using the word certain). For instance, the authors mention the previous works of ``Xie and Jiang''by their refined data assumptions, which assuming that the audience is familiar with these previous works. Meanwhile, many notations are used without a formal definitions although I can understand some of them as they have been used by the previous papers but this can still be a problem for general readers. \n\n1 It would be great if the authors could instantiate the definitions present in this paper or discuss the relationships with the previous assumptions like the Bellman completeness in [1] and the realizability in [2]. For instance, in the example 2, it would be better to prove that the standard Q-pi-realizability is a special case of definition 2 by explicitly specifying the $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{G}$.\n\n2 In example 3, may I take \\phi as the mapping from a Q-function to its greedy policy? So completeness w.r.t. $\\mathcal{T}^\\pi$ for all the functions whose greedy policy is $\\pi$ is indeed completeness w.r.t. $\\mathcal{T}$ for all the functions in $\\mathcal{F}$?\n\n3 While proposition 1 is intuitive and reasonable, it seems that many previous works are indeed constructing the lower bounds through a worst-case consideration on the MDP by constructing a family of MDP classes satisfying the assumptions (e.g. [3]). \n\n4 How did the conditions of theorem 1 compare to the assumptions in [1,2]? This should be highlighted so that the readers can evaluate the roles of the corollaries presented in section 5.1.\n\n5 Most of the coverage assumptions are made with respect to the $\\xi(M) \\in \\Pi$, which is more related to the coverage over $\\Pi$, in contrast to the single-policy coverage assumption ($\\pi^*$) commonly used in the previous works. I am trying to understand the case of $\\pi^* \\in \\Pi$. But due to the presence of $\\xi$, the obtained lower bound may not compete with $\\pi^*$. Can you give an example of the unknown mapping $\\xi(\\cdot)$ so that we can understand the meaning of the target $J_M(\\xi(M))-J_M(\\hat{\\pi})$?\n\n\n\n[1] Bellman-consistent Pessimism for Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\n[2] Offline reinforcement learning with realizability and single-policy concentrability\n\n[3] is pessimism provably efficient for offline rl"

Particularly given that worst-case information-theoretic lower bounds are specific to function-class assumptions\u2014e.g., Foster et al. 2021 prove a lower bound for value-based and exploratory data settings while recent papers such as Zhan et al. 2022 overcame the difficulty by changing the function approximation method. \n- With the model-realizability technique introduced in this paper, the authors show the necessity of the completeness-type assumptions."

They then discussed the relationship between assumptions on function approximations and the Markov decision processes (MDPs) those can be realized. Section 5 presented the main Theorem 1, which says that only realizability-type of assumptions are not enough to learn better policies. Corollaries 1-3 then assure similar results for different variants of realizability-type assumptions. The authors later discussed the limitations of the lower bound results, i.e., using over-coverage and not containing $Q^*$-realizability. Theorem 2 then shows a lower bound for $Q^*$-realizability but with partial coverage which may not cover optimal policy."
