                "value": "The paper introduces a novel extension of the Euclidean CART algorithm into the hyperbolic space, aptly named HyperDT. This extension involves a transformative shift from axis-aligned decision planes to geodesic submanifolds and replaces candidate thresholds with equidistance mid-angles. Notably, other components of HyperDT, including objective functions, remain consistent with the traditional CART framework. This adaptation allows HyperDT to achieve a similar asymptotic complexity as CART. Furthermore, the authors present another contribution in the form of HyperRF, a random forest model built upon the foundations of HyperDT. The paper showcases the good performance of these methods across a spectrum of datasets, including synthetic datasets like Gaussian mixtures, as well as real-world data sources such as biological sequences and graph embeddings. These empirical results underscore the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed techniques."

                "value": "1. In Section 3.2, the authors mentioned that the interpretation of axis-aligned hyperplanes within the hyperboloid model is unclear. Can the authors provide a more detailed explanation of why the use of axis-aligned hyperplanes lacks clarity in this context? I am considering that any geodesic could potentially be represented by two axis-aligned or oblique planes, making the use of axis-aligned planes reasonable.\n    \n2. Additionally, does the geodesic boundary offer advantages beyond classification scores and interpretation? One potential advantage I am considering is that geodesic trees may require fewer nodes compared to axis-aligned trees to achieve similar classification scores. Could the authors include metrics, such as the average number of nodes used in the experiments presented in Table 1, to support this claim?\n    \n3. For a more comprehensive evaluation, could the authors include additional comparison results? As mentioned in the weaknesses section, there are now several global optimization methods, such as [1], that have demonstrated superior performance compared to CART. It would be valuable to include a comparison with at least one of these methods to illustrate the superior performance of geodesic decision boundaries over axis-aligned boundaries.\n    \n4. Ablation experiments: The paper lacks ablation studies or experiments to justify the design choices made in the proposed methods, including the selection of candidate hyperplanes. Since the equidistance mid-angles in the proposed method do not have closed-form solutions and rely on numerical solvers, there may be concerns about the algorithm's efficiency. It would be informative to compare the performance and execution times of the equidistance mid-angles with those of naive mid-angles to assess the impact of these choices on the methods' performance and behavior."

I assume that the point characterized by Eq (11) is the closest point to the origin in said intersection?\n- As a general suggestion, it may be useful to the reader to have both Eq. (7) and Eq. (11) in Figure 1.\n- In the set up of Appendix A.2, a vector $\\mathbf{u}$ is defined. It is unclear exactly what this is. From the combined definition in A.2.2 and Eq. (24), I believe that it is a unit vector pointing in a spacelike direction? What exact is its role?\n- I am unsure how you went from Eq. (24) to Eqs. (25-27). From what I am guessing, $\\mathbf{u}$ defines the direction of the intersecting geodesic, but I am unsure about the \"\\sinh\" parameterization given.\n- What is the connection between dimension $d'$ in Eq.

How would this change generating the decision boundary? Especially due to fact that the assumption of letting dimension except for 0 and d being zero is used to generate the hyperplane characterization.\n- Following from the above, why is Eqs.

                "value": "The paper presents an extension of standard decision trees to the data situated in hyperbolic spaces. Certain types of data are better modeled by sets of recursive splits (decision trees), and also currently there is a growing attention to data analysis in hyperbolic spaces, due to development of hyperbolic embedding models. While there was HoroRF, a way to recursively split data in hyperbolic space, the proposed approach uses a different spliting model that is much simpler to operate and train, and this finding contains a valuable theoretical insight. Practically it also outperforms previously available methods."

                "value": "The paper significantly advances the sub-field of decision tree models for hyperbolic spaces by presenting a novel decision tree model, that produces the splits in a different way, compared to previous state of the art, and leads to asymptotically faster computation times and better practical evaluation."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "What is lacking in my opinion is a theoretical analysis of different decision boundaries and their performance for certain kinds of data (certain kinds of distributions of the data, that we may consider natural in certain classes of problems). For example, in case of regular decision trees, it may be observed that tabular data (where regular decision trees are best performers) is usually situated on axis-parallel hyperplanes and is easily separated by similar axis-parallel splits (due to naturally repeating nature / distribution of the data in tables along some dimensions)\n\nThe paper contains an interesting (and possibly simple to further analyze) case of synthetic data in hyperbolic space consisting of a sample from a mixture of Gaussians. It was observed empirically, that proposed method consistently outperforms the previous HoroRF/HoroDT. Providing a theoretical analysis of why it is the case would fill in the gaps and justify a choice of the proposed subset among all possible decision boundaries in hyperbolic space."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Considering the proposed method and HoroRF, we know two ways of splitting the hyperbolic space, which correspond to an inductive bias that we impose on the data. Are there any other inductive biases / splits that can be considered, but perhaps are currently infeasible or otherwise unsuitable?\n- Particularly, there is an inherent asymmetry of the hyperbolic space towards the center of the Poincare ball - and embeddings usually automatically (without being instructed to do so, during regular optimization) utilize this asymmetry to represent well the hierarchical data. Can we use this asymmetry in designing the splitting method?\n- Following from the previous question, consider the following baseline (should be worse than directly working in hyperbolic space, but better than the straightforward use of regular decision trees):\n-- Transform the data into the Poincare ball. After that, ignore the hyperbolic nature of the data (as in regular decision trees) and transform the data into spherical coordinate system. Now run the regular decision tree on such data.\n-- In this baseline the splits will be concentric spheres which are further split into spherical sectors and sub-sectors.\n-- Would be nice to see a comparison between proposed approach and some approach (such as suggested above) that lies in between the Hyperbolic Trees and Regular Decision Trees."
