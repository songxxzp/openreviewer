What is missing is comparison to those baselines. e.g., self-validation based early stopping is also a non-architectural (and popular) regularization to avoid overfitting. Thus, it\u2019s essential to compare against that baseline (and potentially a few more). The authors have confined themselves to a mere disadvantages summary of such important baselines in the introduction.\n\nSection 4 is presented as the first systematic study on architectural dependencies of untrained networks. However, it is redundant with the investigations already done in the literature. e.g., [1] Appendix B already discusses such design choices conclusively.\n[1]Darestani, M.Z. and Heckel, R., 2021. Accelerated MRI with un-trained neural networks.\u00a0IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging,\u00a07, pp.724-733.\n\nA very interesting case to explore would be investigating architectures that still incur overfitting after applying the proposed regularizations; something not explored in the paper.\n\nMinor\n\nThe space before \u201c(\u201c is often omitted. e.g., many cases in  paragraphs 2&4 of page 3.\n\nSince section 4.1 is also and experimental section in its nature, it\u2019d be useful to have the dataset setup here (similar to section 4.2 or 6). This is because untrained networks require different architectures for each anatomy."

Instead of measuring the absolute masked SSIM curves, one should measure the slope of the fall and the convergence value since it isn\u2019t surprising to see deeper networks overfitting at later stages during the course of optimization.\n\nFurthermore, the claim tries to partly deliver the point that #parameters isn\u2019t the primary factor in overfitting; however, the 2-layer 256-channel network has indeed 4x more parameters compared to the 8-layer 64-channel network according to Tab. 3, and therefore more prone to overfitting because of its #parameters?\nFinally, is Fig. 3 averaged over multiple examples or only the results of one sample? If it\u2019s just one sample, it\u2019d be hard to draw such bold conclusions.\n\n- What are the authors\u2019 thoughts on using their method for 8x? The reviewer fully understands that given the limited rebuttal time, it\u2019s not reasonable to ask for conclusive 8x experiments. But given the fact that the difference between untrained and trained networks enlarges by going from 4x to 8x acceleration, would it be possible to claim that the proposed regularization schemes may help reducing that gap?\n\nMinor\n\n- Isn\u2019t there a better way to design Tab. 2? Because currently, the labels Depth, Width, Kernel size, and Skip connections are placed in a very confusing way."

Such a conclusion lacks merit without theoretical justification or validation across diverse data setups. It remains unclear if the proposed architecture would yield similar results in other scenarios. Notably, the comparison against a fully-sampled ground truth, while foundational, is impractical in real-world applications.\n\n- Lack of Novelty: The realm of MRI reconstruction networks has reached a saturation point in performance (see also the results shown on the fastMRI leaderboard). Therefore, any new approach must offer a distinct advantage absent in existing methods. While incorporating input coordinates and applying Lipschitz regularization might be novel in the context of DIP for MRI, these contributions might not significantly impact the broader MRI reconstruction community.\n\n- Performance: The fastMRI 4x acceleration challenge is widely acknowledged as non-challenging for deep learning models. Reference to Table 12 in the fastMRI dataset paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08839.pdf) indicates that classical TV methods, despite being non-learning-based, yield comparable results to those presented in this paper (both in terms of PSNR and SSIM).
