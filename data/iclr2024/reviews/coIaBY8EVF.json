Platforms can typically only control the set of information provided to buyers. In that sense platforms want to find the representations (or sets of information to present) that improves social welfare. The paper in particular tackles the challenge of congestion where supply does not meet demand. The authors develop a learning technique that to find representations that reduce congestion which they argue using equilibrium analysis improves social welfare under a partial information framework."

One approach they take is to penalize the \"no-choice\" option. Is this reasonable in practice? Often the \"outside\" option can have a large market share in studies of demand.\n\n- The theoretical analysis feels a little misplaced. Specifically, the theoretical analysis seems to focus on the perfect information equilibrium, is this really relevant in the online marketplace scenario as the authors note earlier in the paper? Furthermore, this focuses on proxying social welfare with reducing congestion but this may not be the objective platforms want to optimize for. In fact, decongestion seems practical enough objective on its own. This also involves making assumptions like \"item heterogeneity is captured in revealed features\" which is likely violated in practice.\n\n- It seems like the results in the real data section may rely somewhat on how choices are simulated through prices. Can you comment on how this could affect results if there is some additional dependencies in choices."

                "value": "1.\tArgumentation of the setup:\n\na.\tIn Abstract \u201cThe power of a platform is limited to controlling representations\u2014 the subset of information about items presented by default to users\u201d. This statement is very strong and seems not true. For instance, platforms definitely have other means to control information: besides representations (the amount of info provided per item) there are different ways to control user attention between different items like ranking of items, recommendation of items, etc. So, I strongly suggest rewriting this sentence.\n\nb.\tIn Intro, the end of 2nd paragraph and 3rd paragraph: I do not understand why the described here issue cannot be resolved by some auction (or other mechanism design). The way these paragraphs are written, it sounds like the authors are not aware of vast practical application of auction in web services:\n\n\u2022\tsee, e.g., ad auctions, where they are built to reduce congestion by maximizing welfare (e.g., second price auctions, position auctions) through exploiting imbalance between demand and supply; and in this case, prices (bids) are also set in decentralized way \u2013 so, this argument, does not imply strong conclusion that representation is the only one way.\n\nc.\tIn Intro, Page 2, 3rd paragraph: \u201cunder perceived values remain both valuable and diverse.\u201d Why? + Example after this does not help and is unclear. Why does the problem cannot be resolved by auctions (so, the platform adjust price despite its decentralized price input) or by ranking (playing user attention)?\n\nd.\tI strongly recommend reviewing and rewrite argumentation of viability of the proposed setup: the setup itself sounds, but it should not be positioned as the only way for resolve the marketplace / platform issues\u2026 \n\n---------\n\n2.\tPresentation: I believe Intro can have more details (preserving the same space). For instance,\n\na.\tWhile reading the whole Intro, for me, it was still unclear what is meant by \u201crepresentation\u201d: whether representation is dependent on item (in Setup I\u2019ve found it is not), whether it is about smth like ranking or so (in Setup I\u2019ve found it is not)\n\nb.\tWelfare: is it just about users? Or users + platform? Or welfare of users + sellers? Only, in Setup, I\u2019ve found that it is about users only. BUT in Intro, it is written \u201creduced social welfare\u2014to the detriment of users, suppliers, and the platform itself\u201d which is misleading\u2026 \n\nc.\tSection 4: it would be nice to see some practical examples where these conditions are working. \n\n---------\n\n3.\tML \n\na.\tIn Intro, Page 2, 2nd paragraph: \u201cGiven this, we propose to use machine learning to solve the necessary design problem of choosing beneficial item representations.\u201d Is it true that ML usage is a separate contribution in addition to the proposed setup? (Or ML is a part of the setup?) It would be nice to have clear list of the contributions.\n\nb.\tI believe it is better to improve Sec.2 by removing discussion of ML from discussion of the setup (and discuss ML in a separate section or introduce it directly in Sec.3). Right now, it creates a mix of not fully discussed ML injection (2nd and 3rd paragraphs Page 4: there is nothing about learning objective, what to learn \\mu? \\beta? etc) and Problem setup. I believe optimization problem (Welfare without Expectation) should be introduced before stepping into discussion of ML.  \n\nc.\tEq (6) and (7): Is it OK to train both f on S and use the same S for W_S calculation? Should we split S? Despite theoretical analysis of non-ML setup in Sec.4, I struggle from not having any guarantees on viability of proposed ML approach (are we using standard ML setting with well-known theory and practice?).  It would be nice to have such a discussion somewhere in the text.\n\n---------\n\n4.\tExperiments:\n\na.\tHow are V_{het} and V_{hom} formally defined?\n\nb.\tIt would be nice to have formal direct link/ref to Appendix where details of experimentation are given (both for Sec.5.1 and for Sec.5.2). It is important for reproducibility.\n\nc.\tIn Sec.5.2. \u201cwe optimize Eq.(8) using Adam with\u2026\u201d. What is \u201cAdam\u201d? It is better to give better ref / citation, or more convenient naming.\n\n---------\n\n5.\tMinor:\n\na.\tFootnote 3: it would be interesting to know which problem we face (or which assumptions are broken) when sellers adapt quickly (e.g., dynamic pricing is very common setup in ad auctions)\n\nb.\tEq.(7): formally, it is incorrect to write M \\in S since S consists of pairs (M, y). So, either need to replace by (M,y)\\in S or by a sum over l = 1,\u2026,L\n\nc.\tIn Sec.6: \u201c\"..as well as the study of more elaborate user..\"\u201d:  \u201cof\u201d --> \u201cto\u201d ?"
