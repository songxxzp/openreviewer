Consequently, the notations, proofs, and overall presentation become challenging to digest:\n\n1. The presentation lacks clarity, with numerous notations introduced without proper explanation. For instance, in the paragraph surrounding Equations 6 and 7, the authors transform the original 2-layer residual-connected GCN into a new format, but it remains unclear how these two formulations correspond. Questions arise regarding the meaning of symbols like $p\\_\\mathcal{F}$ and $p\\_\\mathcal{G}$. Additionally, it's unclear what $\\sum_{i\\in [p\\_\\mathcal{F}]}$ and $\\sum_{i\\in [p\\_\\mathcal{G}]}$ represent in the context of GCN. It's also unclear whether $w_{r,i}^\\star$ refers to the i-th or r-th row/column of a weight matrix. This section is not well organized, making it exceptionally challenging to comprehend.\n\n2. The notation on Page 6, particularly at the top under the algorithm section, is even more convoluted. The authors introduce numerous notations, but their purpose and connection to GCN are unclear. I have no idea how these notations relate to the GCN.\n\n3. There appear to be errors in the paper. Detailed questions and concerns have been raised, which should be addressed for clarity and accuracy.\n\n4. 2-layer GNN is not deep enough comparing to existing works. Especially the authors argue existing works' considered model is not deep ..."

According to your sampling method, neither $A^\\star$ nor the \"expectation of the sampled adjacency matrices\" is identical to the original adjacency matrix $A$. Won't this introduce bias during training? In other words, your objective differs from the original objective function. In this case, how can we ensure generalization?\n\n3. What does the first term on page 6, in the first line, represent? Without a clear explanation, I cannot grasp the impact of $A^\\star$ on the $\\epsilon_0$ of Thm3.2.\n\n4. Why C is not trainable in Eq. 1-4? Since this is linear-regression using square loss, cannot we just think this C as identity matrix?\n\n5. What is the $r_w$ and $r_v$ in Eq. 11-12?"

While frequently, the GCN layers are not trained the final layer is, up to the Reviewers' knowledge, always trained to be able to linearly separate classes.\n- Another example is in Section 3.1, where the authors highlight their own work in comparison to others by mentioning that other works only accommodate \"shallow GCNs\". However, the cited works also analyze two-layered GCNs.\n- Some of the assumptions seem highly restrictive: For example in section 3.3. the function $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{G}$ are assumed to be smooth functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{d \\times N} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$. However, as the domain is the graph domain, it is not clear whether this is a reasonable assumption as this could break the permutation equivariance. \n- Another example is the final (untrained) layer in Equation 5, which is simply a matrix multiplication. Thus, does not satisfy universal approximation properties.\n- Many notations and definitions are missing, which leads to confusion. For example, Section 3.4 is unclear. \n- The work lacks clarity, and often explanations and intuitions are not given.

How is it possible that $OPT$ is non-zero?\n-  In Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 3.2: It is not clear with respect to which event the probability is taken.\n- In Theorem 3.2: Could the authors present the assumptions better or give more intuitions?\n- Why do the authors average in Equation 14 over all iterations of the SGD steps?\n- How is $(X,y_n)$ sampled, and how is $\\mathcal{D}$ defined?\n- Could you elaborate on many assumptions, e.g., Section 3.4: it doesn't seem clear that the norms of the learned weight matrices are uniformly bounded."
