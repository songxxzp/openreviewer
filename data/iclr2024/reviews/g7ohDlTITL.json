The main idea is to construct flows from noise samples towards samples from the training distribution in such a way that the entire flow concentrates around the specific training example. The flows can be constructed by flowing along gradients of the Riemannian distance, or, as the authors show, gradients of a premetric. Such premetrics can be constructed to give flows that are efficient to evaluate."

The basic idea is similar to the Euclidean setting, where the authors seek to learn a vector field pushing a tractable base distribution to the data distribution, which is achieved by conditional flow matching on a specified path of probability measures. However, the Riemannian setting introduces several challenges, chiefly in the construction of said probability paths and corresponding flows. The authors demonstrate how to construct such flows using general premetrics, a special case of which is the geodesic distance. Practically, the method enables is simple, scalable approach for learning continuous-time normalizing flows on general manifolds."

For instance, can we say anything about what makes a particular premetric \"good\"? Are there principled reasons someone would choose the diffusion distance over the biharmonic distance? Are spectral distances chosen in Section 3.2 primarily for practical reasons, or are there other aspects that make the corresponding premetrics desirable? Is there a compelling reason spectral distances use the spectrum of Laplace-Beltrami operator, rather than some other operator?"
