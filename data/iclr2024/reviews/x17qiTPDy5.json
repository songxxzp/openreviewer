In particular, GANs are efficient samplers, requiring only one pass of a neural network whereas diffusion models require multiple steps of denoising. Thus, this work derives a stochastic differential equation that encompasses the unification. In particular, there are weighting parameters that yield a smooth transition between GANs and diffusion models. Asymptotic convergence guarantees are also provided along with showing explicit instantiations such as TDPM as special cases."

In my prespective, this work can benefit siginificantly from the following strategies: (1) rearrange the material in Section 3 heavily, e.g, move the majority of 3.2 into the appendix, and dedicate more space for the Diffusion-GAN algorithm; (2) It might be better to just state the informal versions and offer intuitive explanations of major theorems in maintext without getting into details about technical lemmas and assumption, and defer the formal statements and conditions to appendix. \n\n\n- Lack of experiments: it is generally not fair to ask for experiments on theory-oriented paper. However, a major selling point of such formulation is that it leads to a natural design of the diffusion-GAN method. Pariticularly, given the extensive discussion of the advantage of DiffFlow over vinilla GAN in appendix C, it is important to provide empirical verification on the performance of DiffFlow-GAN."

Some of the introduced algorithms, like Diffusion-GAN, are original as well. To my understanding (up to mathematical details in the appendix that I could not thoroughly check), **the theoretical derivations seem correct**.\n\nFinally, the derivations in the paper are, for the most part, **clearly written** (except Section 3.3, cf. weaknesses). The core ideas and intuitions of the paper are well presented, especially regarding the details of the particular cases of DiffFlow which are well articulated between each other."

I look forward to discussing with the authors and other reviewers on this topic.\n\n### Overclaiming Results\n\nAs it is currently written, the paper suffers from **strong overclaiming** of its results. Clarifying the claims and adjusting them so that they are properly supported by theoretical or empirical evidence is a necessity.\n\nLet me recall the stated \"research question\" of p. 2, to which the authors provide a \"positive response\".\n> Can we develop a unified theoretical framework for GANs and SDMs that allows for a flexible trade-off between high sample quality and fast sampling speed, while enabling exact likelihood inference?\n\nThe unifying framework does exist, but there is no element supporting the rest of the claim in the paper. While there are new introduced algorithms, **their properties are not assessed with any experiment**. Moreover, to my understanding, there is no concrete discussion as to why the framework enables exact likelihood inference in its general case (and in particular, for GANs).\n\nFurthermore, the unifying framework only encompasses derivations of the vanilla GAN model from Goodfellow et al. (2014), and not all GANs (like Wasserstein GANs, for example). This should be explicitly stated, starting from the abstract.\n\n### Incomplete and Unclear Link with GANs\n\nAn important weakness of the paper and presented framework is the link of DiffFlow with GANs in Section 3.3. While central in the paper's claims and contributions, **the link with GANs is loose and presented in an unclear fashion**.\n\nFirstly, **the development of Section 3.3 is incomplete** to fully understand the presented contribution, as it misses in particular details on how to handle the generator. The development in Appendix Section B should be moved in the main paper for completeness.\n\nSecondly and more importantly, even taking into account Appendix Section B, **the link with GANs remains loose**. The paper does establish that the gradient of the log ratio corresponds to an optimal vanilla GAN discriminator. However, how this can be articulated with GAN generators is left unfinished in the appendix: for example, Equations 27 and 28 only deal with the evolution of generator parameters w.r.t. training time. This does not correspond to Equations 12 or 13 in the main paper, hence to DiffFlow.\n\nThis problem is illustrated by Appendix Section K on framing TPDM (Zheng et al., 2022) using the DiffFlow equation. The authors split the generating equation of DiffFlow into two parts: one with discriminator-guided dynamics (assimilated to the first step of TPDM), and one with score-guided dynamics (the second step of TPDM). Yet, in TPDM, the first step is not a discriminator-guided dynamics, but simply a forward pass through a generator, which is not encompassed in the proposed framework.\n\n### Overclaiming Novelty\n\nWhile the theoretical results seem correct, their presentation is flawed as **it lacks contextualization w.r.t. already existing works**, making them appear more innovative than they actually are. I detail this issue in the following.\n- Proposition 1, to my understanding, is similar to results already obtained by Song et al. (2021), who already needed to compute the variance of the marginal distributions.\n- The noise-corrupting strategies for Vanilla GANs mentioned in Appendix Sections B and C are strongly linked to preexisting works leveraging noise to regularize the discriminator, e.g. instance noise (S\u00f8nderby et al., 2017) and diffusion GANs (Wang et al., 2023).\n- Proposition 2 is a direct consequence of the Fokker-Planck equation (see e.g. Jordan et al., 1998). The result may be lesser known in the generative modeling community, but, given the lack of technical novelty, this should be explicitly stated.\n- By Proposition 2, I believe that the convergence results (minimization of the KL and Theorem 1) are direct consequences of the fact that the studied dynamics is equivalent to the well known Langevin dynamics; cf. Jordan et al. (1998) and the extensive literature on this topic.\n\nJordan et al. The variational formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation. SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis, 1998.\\\nS\u00f8nderby et al. Amortised MAP inference for image super-resolution. ICLR 2017.\\\nWang et al. Diffusion-GAN: Training GANs with Diffusion. ICLR 2023.\n\n### Minor Issues\n\nLess importantly than the above weaknesses, the paper could benefit from further polishing to improve its factualness and readability.\n- In the abstract and later in the paper, the authors state that DiffFlow describes \"the learning dynamics of both SDMs and GANs\". This is incorrect since it does not describe the learning dynamics of SDMs, instead it does describe their generation process.\n- It is not clear to me how Remark 1 makes the convergence result of Theorem 1 directly applicable to the general DiffFlow equation.\n- The organization of the paper is difficult to follow as some of the main contributions listed in the introduction are relegated to the appendix. All contributions should clearly appear in the main paper. The appendix should also appear in the same file as the main paper.\n- The authors state in Section 2.2 that \"the training dynamics of GANs are unstable due to the high non-convexity of the generator and discriminator\". Explaining instabilities in the training dynamics of GANs remains an open problem, so this statement should be supported with a reference.\n- It is not clear how the drift term $f$ can be assimilated to regularization / weight decay.\n- It seems that the first two equations of p. 7 are the same.\n- Remarks on the form:\n  - subsubsection 3.3.1 should not exist as it is the only one of its subsection;\n  - all equations should be numbered;\n  - the acronym SLCD is not explained in the main paper;\n  - the paper Song et al., marked as 2020b in the paper, was actually published in 2021;\n  - the name diffusion GANs is already taken by Wang et al. (2023), cf. the \"novelty\" section of this review."
