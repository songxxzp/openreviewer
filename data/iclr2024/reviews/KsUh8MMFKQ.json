A similar small issue is present in Figure 3 with a typo in \"Separatering\". Unfortunately, most of the presented tasks are dynamic, hence images don't capture them all that well, and hence the animations on the website do a more convincing job on why this particular application case matters.\nAnother point is that a lot of information is pushed to the Appendix, even though it could be beneficial to have in the main text. For example, the description of the hybrid method, which is a quite large engineering contribution of the paper to show working policies, is described on a high-level. A more detailed description would help here, and mentioning how much work it was to tune/balance the gradient-free and gradient-based steps could help the community.

                "value": "The idea of the paper are clear and the writing is easy to follow. Some of that, however, stems from a lack of detail regarding the simulator and the tasks. The description of the simulator, one of the core contributions, is barely a page long and mostly covers high-level concepts, physical quantities being modeled, and methods used to implement the simulator. I would have expected to see greater detail about this as currently it's hard to assess if this is a straight forward task of writing up a few equations or involved required complex derivations and developments. What also would be good is a discussion regarding the chosen way of modeling thin objects, as the approach selected is likely not the only one and a discussion of the pros and cons of modeling the interactions one way or another would be a valuable contribution.\n\nAnother aspect where more detail would be expected are the task descriptions. The tasks are easy to understand at a high level. However, their actual definition is omitted which makes it unclear what objective the various methods are required to optimize for later on. As there are many ways to formulate the described tasks it is important to have this information present.\n\nOne aspect of the experiments that could be improved is conveying what the goal is. The only information is that the goal is to evaluate the performance and behavior of the simulator and methods. Being more concrete and actually laying out the things to be investigated would improve the readability of the entire section.\n\nThe presentation of the results is at times incomplete. For example, Table 2 shows numbers with +/- values but there is no mention of what those values are. One can assume that it is mean +/- standard deviation, however, this should be stated clearly. In that table there is also a single row which has no +/- values, why? There are also various cells in the table that are lacking values, which is not explained. The results list score values for each of the tasks, but without knowing level of \"success\" these scores correspond to it is impossible to know whether the differences in scores are significant or not.\n\nThe presentation of the real-world experiments does not convey any information and fails to provide information. This section should either be improved to add actual experimental data, as opposed to referring the reader to an appendix with a handful of plots, and provide a discussion.\n\nThe paper describes a hybrid approach, though details are extremely limited. Due to the lack of detail of that approach and the focus being about the simulator, it is unclear why this was added nor that it adds anything. The idea of combining global search with local refinement is sensible. However, I would expect this to be common knowledge in the RL community given the (by default) unguided nature of RL exploration and the fact that RL tends to perform well once it finds a solution to a problem. There are also odd behaviors of the hybrid method that are not discussed. In some of the curves shown in Figure 3 the variance in the scores are excessively large, why does this occur?\n\nAnother question that should be addressed is the benchmark aspect. The paper states that the goal is for this to be used as a benchmark. Is the idea to use this similar to gym and atari game setups, or more like the benchmarks used in the computer vision community with tasks on withheld data to counteract overfitting on a set of tasks?\n\nThe core aspects of the paper, i.e. the simulator and task descriptions, are good yet could benefit from additional detail. The experiments are ok, though need to be improved to more clearly convey their information."
