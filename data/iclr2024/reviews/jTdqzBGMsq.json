                "value": "This paper proposes a simple modification of the LLama Adapter V1 in order to achieve more parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The novelty is to have one global set of tokens (or in the extreme: only one token) that all layers attend to, rather than per-layer tokens. Attention weights for each layer are separate. The result is a very small set of parameters to fine-tune. \nThis method (based on Llama2 7B and 13B) is compared against LLama Adapter and LoRA on the Vicuna benchmark for instruction following and the PKU-Beaver dataset for DPO alignment with human values. The results show that the success of the method varies between model sizes and with different numbers of training epochs, but overall scores win ratios of around 0.4-0.5 on Vicuna, and performs better or on par for most categories of the PKU-Beaver set. \n\nWhile the results seem promising, they lack deeper analysis and a more concise interpretation (see below). Given the small novelty of the technical solution, the paper should have allocated more space for an investigation of the implications of this small change."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- In three places it is argued that intuitive inspection confirms the success of the proposed method, by showing one example (Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3). The argument is weak, as it\u2019s not a systematic inspection and could have been a cherry-picked example, and is left for subjective evaluation by the reader without any elaboration of why the quality is sufficient. In Section 5.3 this is particularly irritating since quantitative results for the one-token approach are missing, and the reader is left to trust that this example is representative. In 5.1 the example is used to dismiss the quality of the Vicuna evaluations (\u201ctoo much variance\u201d), which could have easily been tested and quantitatively verified by running the evaluation multiple times and reporting mean and variance.\n- The interpretation of the win ratio for Aligner 1 (1 token) in Table 1 is given as \u201ccomparable\u201d with the baselines, but it is actually <0.5, so technically worse than the baselines. This interpretation seems rather too optimistic, it is missing an analysis and a focus on the loss cases, because in practice no one wants to deploy a technique that worsens previous results, perhaps even if there\u2019s an win in parameter efficiency. The trade-off between quality and number of parameters for the new and the standard adapter would have been helpful to compare directly in a plot.\n- Large portions of the paper are dedicated to reviewing the background, the basics of Llama Adapter and RLHF. Considering that the proposed method is a minor modification, more space should have been rather invested for more exhaustive ablations and deeper analysis of why the method works, how it differs qualitatively from Llama Adapter, and how the hypothesis of separation of form and knowledge can be empirically verified."

Moreover, model-based evaluation has been shown to have several limitation in the literature, and I do not believe the field is yet ready to accept results based only on model-based evaluation. For this reason, despite its technical contributions, and I do not think this work can be accepted in its current state.\n- Several grammatical/language errors and inconsistencies e.g. \"Llama-Adapter\" vs \"LLaMA-Adapter\"\n- Strictly speaking, LLaMA-Adapter (and likewise Aligner) do not prepend prefix tokens. They employ a side-channel of attention over a separate set of tokens. The softmax is compute separately from the actual input tokens (see: Eqn 8), and position encodings are not applied to the LLaMA-Adapter/Aligner keys.\n- The experiment demonstrating the efficacy of single-head Aligner is a simply a handful of examples of generated outputs. This does not meet the bar of rigorous evaluation for a conference paper."
