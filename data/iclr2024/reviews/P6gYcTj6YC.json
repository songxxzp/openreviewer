Even the log-expected reconstruction loss in Eq. (24) can be considered as an upper bound of taking log of the dissimilarity measure $d$, ie, $\\log d(\\textbf{x}, \\hat{\\textbf{x}}(\\textbf{z}))$ (using Jensen's).\n- The above perspective also skips the need for approximating the normalizer of the EDDF. I feel like this perspective can be made especially since the decoding is done deterministically in practice and thus an explicit density $p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\textbf{x} \\mid \\textbf{z})$ does not seem to be needed. As such, additional input for why $p_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\textbf{x} \\mid \\textbf{z})$ should be defined explicitly would be great (and if there is prior work which took such a simplistic approach).\n- One further note, the above perspective seems to fit in the narrative of \"generalized variational inference\" (See, eg, \"An optimization-centric view on Bayes' rule: reviewing and generalizing variational inference\" Section 4.4.4, switching log-likelihood for a general dissimilarity function).\n\nClarity in Section 4\n\n- Eq. (20) is misleading as from Eq. (29) the equality should instead be an upper bound due to Jensen's.\n- Why is the M / 2 factor not utilized in Eq. (24)?\n- Above Eq. (25) there is a mention of \"well-trained autoencoder\" with a condition on $D$. I believe this should be $\\gamma$ instead?\n\nOther:\n\n- It is worth clarifying what the regularization loss is in Eq. (25). I believe it is Eq. (7) with isotropic Gaussian (after digging through part of the code), but I am unsure given the current text.\n- Something to add to Section 3.1: It might be worth mentioning that exponential family distributions can be explicitly be characterized as a density $ \\propto \\exp(- B_f(\\cdot, \\textbf{m}))$ where $ B_f$ is a Bregman divergence, see, eg, \"Information Geometry and Its Applications\" Section 2.7."

                "value": "1) The writing of the paper is somewhat obscure, especially in what concerns long sentences, cf below. \n\n2) The rational to consider the minimization, instead of the standard maximization, of the ELBO objective is not clear.\n\n3) The results seems to be too incremental, many previous works have proposed to replace the Gaussian distribution in VAE by some other distributions. \n\n4) In  2 out of 5 cases in the  described empirical results, the baselines from previous papers performed better (Table 5)\n\n5) The standard deviations in the experiments are not reported.\n\n6) Only two out of many metrics evaluating VAE  quality are calculated.  In particular, the reconstruction errors are not reported in the comparison tables. \n\n7) Rather simple datasets are considered only. Also only the visual domain is considered. \n\nSome remarks :\n\npage 1 : \"VAEs with the commonly used settings practically suffer from performance\ndegradation, such as reconstruction fidelity and generation naturalness\" -> perhaps ... insufficient reconstruction fidelity and... Since as it stands, both the \"reconstruction fidelity\" and \"generation naturalness\" appear as undesired/bad qualities. \n\npages 2-3: \"...with negative ELBO objective... whose maximization ...\" - usually the negative ELBO objective is minimized\n\npage 4, last equation in (16) - it seems that the paper's method seeks to maximize the reconstruction loss, given by a positive distance cf eqs (9), (18).\n\nFollowing improvements made during rebuttal I'm raising the score, however some issues require further work."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Some suggestions: To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, the  standard deviations should be measured in the experiments for various random seeds. Also, more than just two metrics should be measured. The comparison with baselines performance in other domains and on more complex real- world datasets is also necessary for evaluation of the method's practicality."
