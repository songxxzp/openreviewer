While standard attention captures pairwise interactions between tokens, the third-order tensor variant was suggested in the context of capturing triplet interactions.\u00a0\n\nThe current paper shows that\u00a0if the input entries are bounded, and if it suffices to compute each entry of the attention output approximately rather than exactly, then there is an almost-linear time algorithm for computing this operation. The bound on the entry magnitude is asymptotically (conditionally) tight, as the paper also shows that without this bound, computing this attention output in time significantly better than the trivial n^3 time computation is SETH-hard, in the complexity theoretic sense. Both the algorithm and the hardness result are generalizations (in terms of both the results themselves, and the techniques used to prove them) of a recent work of Alman and Song (2023) that proved them for standard attention. The results also extend to tensors of higher orders (than 3)."

It is entirely about a form of tensor attention that has been suggested as a bit of an afterthought in a recent work (Sanford 2023), that deemed it likely impractical and anyway did not implement it. Thus it is not about an architecture that is actually used or presently considered usable. This raises the question of what is the import of showing the existence of an almost-linear time approximation algorithm for it, and whether this algorithm makes sense as part of a neural network (I believe the paper does not touch on this point). A negative outlook on this paper would be that the interesting results and the conceptual message in this line of research were already given in Alman and Song (2023), and the extension to higher-order tensors in this manuscript might be an elegant intellectual and mathematical exercise, albeit without much consequence to the ML community. Nonetheless, since the content does seem elegant, and there is always the issue of benefit-of-doubt about whether a piece of theoretical research would have implications down the road, I prefer to vote for acceptance."

On the other hand, if the max entries of the input matrices are at least $\\Omega(\\sqrt[3]{\\log n}$), one cannot hope to efficiently approximate  the attention matrix in less than cubic time, assuming SETH. The latter hardness result is shown by reducing from the Gap Max IP problem, whose hardness is then shown through a combination and generalization of previous techniques.  Furthermore, the work shows the techniques developed above can be extended to characterize the gap in computational complexity in $k$-th order generalization of the attention scheme."
