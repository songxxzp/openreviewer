What is the downstream task the authors have in mind when they talk about missing of labeled data? Also after the authors talk a lot about pre-training/fine-tuning and the necessity of the labelled data. For the forecasting, e.g., you can use transfer learning/fine-tune. This is related to the discussion on global models that is missing.\n\nRelated Works.\nIn Forecasting section: there are a lot of works, authors should at least cite as Makridakis competitions (M4, M5, M6), moreover, the Gradient Boosting methods (XGB and LGBM) are also often employed and not mentioned.\n\nIn missing value imputation section there are some recent works that use autoencoder methods as a fusion architecture that are not discussed [e.g., Pereira et al., Reviewing Autoencoders for Missing Data Imputation: Technical Trends, Applications and Outcomes, 2020; Buonanno et al.,Fusion of energy sensors with missing values, 2023; ]\n\nAlso in anomaly detection more recent works applied to the energy context are missing.\n\nFig.2(a) the colors of the nodes are too similar.\n\nWhat is the meaning of \"masked and unmasked patches of different nodes can overlap at temporal axis\"? What is the unmasked patches? What is \\tilde{N}?\n\nWhat is the \"learnable mask token\"? A particular token that subtistute the missing data? How this token is learned?\n\nThe table 3 and 4 don't show that PowerGPT is SOTA for the imputation task!\n\nA lot of typos:\ne.g. empolyed\ntrys\nwe retrieval\nhoricontal\ntrianin\nare in v --> are in bold?\nTab. ?? \nconstrastive\nto to\nI suggest to carefully check the english\n\nI suggest to reorganize the results section.

It would be recommended to conduct experiments on one or more established benchmarks as well. I can recommend BuildingsBench [2], which is a recently published benchmark of 7 electricity datasets for evaluating pretraining-the-finetuning approaches for short-term (24 hour) building load forecasting.\n- A discussion on related work is missing. See examples of references, including papers on transformers for load forecasting as well as transfer learning for load forecasting [3,4,5,6].\n- The paper needs proofreading to correct typos and fix grammar issues.\n\n\n### References\n\n1.
