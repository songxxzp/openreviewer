It might be helpful if the authors could write a small appendix with simple examples of dynamical systems/fixed points that meet the various definitions/rely on the various definitions. This could help a reader unfamiliar with dynamical systems analysis gain intuition before trying to dive into the main results.\n\nFor the different phases: how are the sharpness and loss dynamics related to the phases and known phenomenology like Edge of Stability? Ostensibly this information is available in Figure 4, but I find it very hard to parse in its current form. More explicit discussion of these points, and either improved points (or maybe some sort of table of converged values?) would be valuable.

Additionally, experiments without assuming orthogonal data are conducted, and the experimental results demonstrate that the theoretical findings under orthogonal data assumption hold generally.

Even I believe it is reasonable to leave this as a future problem at the current stage, it is not clear that the technical barrier will not affect the results of dynamical systems in Theorem 2.1. Let me be specific.\n\nThe orthogonality assumption can be translated into following statement: let $F(\\textbf{X})$ be a mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{dn}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{\\frac{n^2-n}{2}}$ defined by\n$$F_1(\\textbf{X})=X_1^{\\top}X_2$$...$$F_{\\frac{n^2-n}{2}}(\\textbf{X})=X_{n-1}^{\\top}X_n$$\ni.e., the upper triangle of $\\textbf{X}\\textbf{X}^{\\top}$ without diagonals. The orthogonality is equivalent to $\\textbf{X}\\in F^{-1}(0)$ where $0\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\frac{n^2-n}{2}}$. I have not found a detailed discussion on the relation between $d$ and $n$ (or I have missed it). Intuitively it is a crucial aspect to the results of this paper. Roughly speaking, let's say $dn>\\frac{n^2-n}{2}$ (i.e. $d>\\frac{n-1}{2}$), then what has been proved in Theorem 2.1 holds only if the data set is from a measure zero set ($F^{-1}(0)$ is a lower dimensional manifold, something like that, I did not check the regularity at $0$). I am not sure if we can perturb the current argument from a measure zero set, since analyzing interacting dynamics is a challenging and unexplored direction (Xu et al, 2022). \n\nTherefore, from this perspective, we can only rigorously state: The main results holds if $d>\\frac{n-1}{2}$ and the data matrix lies on a measure set, which is generically impossible. \n\nMore importantly, even we believe what is indicated in this paper, the requirement of $d>\\frac{n-1}{2}$ is unnatural. The size of training set can be arbitrarily large and the dimension of data point is supposed to be fixed as long as the training task is determined. Thus the assumption of orthogonality is expected to capture the case of $n>>d$, but then there seems to be much more work ahead since the equations of defining $\\textbf{X}\\in F^{-1}(0)$ is over-determined and a careful analysis is needed. Unfortunately, this is completely ignored in this paper and the experiment does not capture this case since $d=100$ and $n=80$, or in the appendix, the non-orthogonal data set has not provided the choice of $d$.\n\nAbove observation is crucial in evaluating the importance of the results in this paper, from a machine learning perspective. Note that these concerns might be resolved or argued to be trivial, that will be great if true. The techniques used in this work is interesting and the paper has provided a profound connection between dynamical system and training process."

                "value": "1. Corollary 1 doesn't distinguish catapult, periodic, and chaos behaviors. However, from the experiments it seems both these three patterns can appear. How can we determine the range of step sizes that can differentiate these three behaviors ?\n\n     2. In Theorem 3.3, it appears that the non-decreasing behavior of gradient descent can only occur in this model when the step size is on the order of $O(\\sqrt{m}dn)$, which seems to be a very large value. What are the step sizes used in related research? Can the results in the current paper be compared to them? Additionally, as shown in C.1, several different step sizes are chosen to demonstrate various dynamics behaviors. Do these step sizes conform to the theoretical results?\n\n     3. It is claimed that training in the phases of periodicity and chaos provides the highest test accuracy in the conclusion part. However, in figure 8 it is shown that the testing losses of periodicity and chaos are larger than the decreasing phase. Am I missing something here ?\n\n4. In C.2 non-orthogonal data, what is $d$ in this experiment?"

                "value": "The submission presents an analysis of the dynamics of gradient descent on non-linear problems through a simplified 1-d model. The main results show that, depending on the step-size, the loss can converge with monotonic decrease, non-monotonic decrease, oscillate periodically, exhibit chaotic behavior, or diverge. The results are illustrated through examples on quadratic regression and fitting the first layer of a 2-layer neural network with quadratic activations under the simplifying assumption that the features are orthogonal. The paper presents experimental evidence that similar dynamics appear without this simplifying assumption."

Specifically, that the full range of behavior observed in practice (phases 1-5) are reproducible on this toy example, not only in practice but provably so. I believe this contribution is novel and would be of interest to the part of the community interested in training dynamics and dynamical systems."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I think this could be a strong submission, but its current message is somewhat unclear, specifically in its relation to other empirical work. My main concerns are about\n- Its main message; the motivation for and the significance of the contribution for a general ML audience and empirical researchers\n- And possibly related, the relationship between the submission and concepts originating from more empirical works, such as the edge of stability and catapults.\n\nThe paragraphs below provide specific examples of where I think the submission lacks in clarity, in the hope this feedback can help a revision to better convey the intended message of the submmission. _I do not expect a detailled response to the points below. I would rather the discussion period focus on clarifying the motivation and significance aspects raised in the questions._\nIf a revision adresses those issues, I will raise my score.\n\n---\n\n**Motivation and significance for a more general audience**\n\nThe introduction conveys the message that the dynamics of gradient descent on non-linear models are poorly understood, and that the quadratic model has been used in prior work. The related work seems sufficiently comprehensive. But I find it difficult to articulate what broader problem the submission is making progress towards.\n\nThe related work section focuses on highlighting the difference between existing work and this submission (\"The result are not applicable to quadratic regression\", do not \"formally prove the existence of chaos\", do not \"characterize the 5 phases\", \"not applicable to the cubic map\"). This does not show that the submission is \"solving a problem\", but rather presents a different analysis on a different settings. It might be an interesting mathematical result, but it is not clear what impact it would have on the broader ML community.\n\nFor example, from an optimization perspective, it is not clear that the later settings (periodic, chaotic and divergent) are relevant, as it's not converging regardless. Part of the broader goal might be the connections with unstable convergence, edge of stability and catapults, but if so those relationships are not clear after my reading.\n\n\n**Defining EOS and Catapults, specifying what is meant by similarity**\nPlaces where the text states a similarity or relations between concepts, for example \"Various patterns like catapult (also related to edge of stability)\" (\u00a71.1, pararagraph 2), would be improved by explicitly stating what the similarity/relation is. Is the wording referring to a specific relationship, or using it to convey the message that both exhibit non-monotonic behavior? It is not clear to me what the relation is, especially as those concepts come from empirical observations rather than formal definitions.\n\nThe working definition of catapult used by Lewkowycz et al. includes the idea that the sharpness decreases after a catapult. The definition of Edge of stability includes the idea that the sharpness rises to 2/step-size. To better place the submission in context and make specific claims, the submission should state such working definitions, as not every reader might hold the same understanding.\n\nSuch a working definition is somewhat implied by the use of the wording \"catapult phase\" for the convergent but non-monotonic phase, but I would encourage the more neutral `non-monotonic phase`. Although this phrasing mirrors the one used by Lewkowycz et al., it is implying that the defining behavior of this phase is the presence of catapults, which is not established. Calling it `non-monotonic` and stating that it this is the phase we can expect catapults to exist would be more accurate. Unless, of course, the point that the authors want to make is that this is the _definition_ of catapults, but this does not appear to be the case from my reading. \n\n\nAnother point where what is meant by \"relation\" should be clarified is in\"the chaotic dynamics (and related stochasticity)\" (\u00a71.1, par. General results) and \"A main take-away from our analysis and experiments so far is that [GD] behaves like [SGD], except that the randomness here is with respect to the orbit it converges to\" (\u00a74.2) use \"stochastic\" and \"random\" in a way I do not recognise, as the mechanisms studied in the submission are deterministic.\n\n\n**Terminology** \nThe submission would benefit from being more careful in its choice of terminology. The two more noticeable examples were\n- \"large-order step-size\", which is used in multiple places. The specific phrasing makes me think there might be a special definition of what \"large-order\" means, as opposed to the simpler \"large\", but no definition is provided. If there is no special meaning, I would suggest using \"large\".\n- \"Phase\", which seems to refer to the behavior of the algorithm with different step-sizes. This might make sense to an audience coming from dynamical system or who have read the work of Lewkowycz et al. recently, but this term is overloaded. It is fine when used as in \"phase transition\", but in \"training phase\" it could be understood as referring to different times of one training procedure. I would suggest not using \"training phase\" and making this usage clear on first use for a more general ML audience. \n\n\n**Misc.**\n- The second and third paragraphs conflate two settings. The statements  \"Very much violating the classical case\" (\u00a71, paragraph 3) and \"In fact, the necessity for larger step-sizes to expedite convergence and the ensuing chaotic behavior has also been observed empirically ... by Van Den Doel and Ascher (2012)\" (\u00a71.1, paragraph 2) appear misleading in the context of the submission, or should at least be modified to specify \"the necessity _for step-size schedules to include large step-sizes_\". As it stands, the statement applies to GD generally, including the setting studied in the paper, and it is not clear that observations in one setting transfer to the other(the two settings being [step-size _schedules_ on (classes of functions such as smooth/strongly convex functions that include) quadratics leading to (almost) linear map updates] vs [non-linear maps with constant step-size]).\n- The illustrations need improvements. The font size is too small to be readable. The figures with multiple lines (Fig. 3, 4) would benefit from having different line styles to be readable when printed."
