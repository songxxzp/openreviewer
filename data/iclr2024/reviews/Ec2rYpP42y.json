Regarding the second part, the problem setting is simplified to the case where the authors assume a pre-defined discrete set to choose from, e.g. deblurring, JPEG decompression, SR, etc. UFODM performs favorably over prior arts such as BlindDPS and GibbsDDRM. Preliminary experiments on *unspecified forward operator* is also provided."

UFODM is the first method to tackle the case where one does not even know the class of forward operator (i.e. whether it is deblurring, SR, or JPEG decompression). This is definitely an interesting and practical question, which, when solved, will have a high impact in the field."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Focusing on blind deblurring, UFODM becomes similar to FastDiffusionEM, which also uses $\\Pi$GDM update step for x, and uses MAP to update the kernels. The difference is that [1] uses the plug-and-play denoiser prior augmented with expectation-maximization (EM) approach, which is usually superior to standard gradient descent. Given that the UFODM does not compare directly with [1], I can only guess that it will be inferior to FastDiffusionEM.\n\n2. Extending 1, I think the authors must compare against FastDiffusionEM. One might complain that it is only an arxiv paper yet, but considering the highly fast-growing and competitive nature of the field, and also given that the code is already open-sourced, it wouldn't take too long to run a head-to-head comparison against it.\n\n3. Even when comparing against BlindDPS [2] and GibbsDDRM [3], it does not seem that UFODM consistently outperforms the prior arts. Yes, it does outperform [2,3] when time-travel trick is utilized, but time-travel is a standard trick that can easily be incorporated into all of the solvers, which makes the comparison unfair. Given that UFODM is an ad-hoc mix of Gibbs sampling and MAP optimization, it is important to show the empirical strength, which, in my opinion, is insufficient.\n\n4. The problem setting for unknown $\\mathcal{H}$ is unrealistic. Considering even the canonical degradations that arise in computational photography, the number of classes in the set exponentially grows. This is especially true if we start to consider a mixture of degradations, which usually happen in the real-world.\n\n5. Even if the algorithm is not theoretically grounded, it is intuitive when one does not consider sampling from $\\mathcal{H}$. However, the part of inferring $\\mathcal{H}$ seems quite odd, or at least unrealistic. In order to choose $\\mathcal{H}^*$, one has to run all the diffusion process for each candidate $\\mathcal{H}$, which will be painfully slow as the number of possible class increases. Moreover, the criterion is the distance from the measurement, which does not seem to be a particularly *good* metric. My concern is corroborated from seeing that the accuracy of $\\mathcal{H}$ for ImageNet is 61.3% even when there are only 3 classes to choose from.\n\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Laroche, Charles, Andr\u00e9s Almansa, and Eva Coupete. \"Fast Diffusion EM: a diffusion model for blind inverse problems with application to deconvolution.\" arxiv 2023.\n\n[2] Chung, Hyungjin, et al. \"Parallel diffusion models of operator and image for blind inverse problems.\" CVPR 2023.\n\n[3] Murata, Naoki, et al. \"Gibbsddrm: A partially collapsed gibbs sampler for solving blind inverse problems with denoising diffusion restoration.\" ICML 2023."

When considering unknown forward operators, is the quality factor of JPEG compression inferred as a by-product of the blind inverse problem solver? For SR, is the blur kernel also inferred here?\n\n4. It is said that $T'$ = 65 was chosen, which seems a bit ad-hoc. Do you use a strategy like CCDF [2] for initialization?\n\n5. In the inner for loop of Algorithm 1, Line 8 and Line 10 iteratively samples for $\\mathbf{x}_t$ and $\\varphi$. When sampling for $\\mathbf{x}_t$, a $\\Pi$GDM step will be involved, and an NFE will be needed. When taking $T' = 65$ and $N = 100$ as stated in the paper, this would be inducing 6500 NFE, which is probably not the case. Is there a typo in the algorithm?\n\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Laroche, Charles, Andr\u00e9s Almansa, and Eva Coupete. \"Fast Diffusion EM: a diffusion model for blind inverse problems with application to deconvolution.\" arxiv 2023.\n\n[2] Chung, Hyungjin, Byeongsu Sim, and Jong Chul Ye. \"Come-closer-diffuse-faster: Accelerating conditional diffusion models for inverse problems through stochastic contraction.\" CVPR 2022."

What are the limitations of assuming a known prior p(phi)? etc. The feeling is that it is not easily understandable from the paper in which situation one can implement the author's approach for solving 'real-world' inverse problems.
