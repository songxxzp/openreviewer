Specifically, the author argues that the challenge this work aims to address here is \"investigating the entire set $\\mathcal{F}$ is always a valid but expensive option considering the size of $\\mathcal{F}$\". However, Algorithm 1 needs to iteratively query the verifier on subsets of $\\mathcal{F}$, with the subset in the first couple of iterations potentially quite large. Particularly, at the first iteration, the cardinality of $F_{S_0} \\cup F_{S_1}$ seems to be half of $\\mathcal{F}$. Therefore, it is not immediately clear to me how the proposed algorithm reduces the overall computational complexity, and some additional explanation would be preferred.\n- While the visualizations in Figure 3 are nice, it would be helpful and more meaningful if they could be generated from commonly used model architectures, as ConvNets and vision transformers may attend to different parts of the input image compared with the feed-forward networks used in this paper. Are there any challenges for applying the proposed methods to these more sophisticated networks, since these models usually also have a linear layer as the final layer? I believe that this paper will benefit from a more diverse empirical evaluation.\n- Some typos: \"uppper\" on page 5; \"both the baselines\" on page 8."

However, this paper aims to identify important/human-understandable proof features that can explain how the DNN verifier works, so I wonder why we need a DNN verifier to be explainable in the first place. The following question is: after we obtain the top proof feature (e.g., the one returned by your algorithm), how can we use the extracted insight to assist the DNN verification procedure or the development of adversarially robust models? \n\nWithin the proposed problem formulation, the paper did quite a good job explaining the relevant concepts of proof features and developing a well-motivated algorithm to prioritize the proof features.

Does the provably robust training method CROWN-IBP have a much lower standard accuracy because it overly filters the meaningful features?\n\n3. How can the extracted top proof features benefit the development of better DNN verifiers or robust training methods?\n\n\n============== Post Rebuttal Comments ==============\n\nI appreciate the authors' feedback and additional experimental results.
