It addresses a common concern of the majority of previous works, where the train procedure and the test procedure of the EEs were mismatched (e.g., jointly training all the early exits during training while thresholding their outputs during test). \n\nIn the proposed framework, each EE is associated to a probabilistic gate, and everything is trained jointly with a bilevel optimization problem, where the outer problem is defined over the gates and the inner problem over the EEs. The system is trained to also minimize execution time by training the gates to select the first exit having good accuracy for each pattern.\n\nThey also propose a novel conformal prediction (CP) strategy for EE networks, where different thresholds are selected for each exit (since each exit will observe a different subset of values at inference times)."

                "value": "I find it hard to fully understand the method before reading through the entire paper. In particular: (a) the abstract has no mention of the paper's contributions; (b) the \"Contributions\" also does not explain how the method works; (c) there is no visual schema of the model; (d) some important details are described very late, for example \"Gate design\" is part of the experimental section but it is a crucial design decision. Overall it is understandable, but I think some minor reorganization and some additional visual descriptions (maybe a shortened pseudo-code?) can significantly help the reader.\n\nOn the novelty, I think a few methods could be added and discussed more. For example, the zero-time waste model (cited in the paper) has a geometric ensemble of the early exits which is very similar to their gating probability, if I understand correctly. As another example, differentiable branching (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9054209) considers a trainable exit strategy that also combines the EEs and that can be trained end-to-end with the rest of the network. Some of these methods can be also added to the experimental comparison.\n\nConcerning the last point, I am curious about transfer learning from a large, generalist dataset (ImageNet) to a small dataset which is basically in the same domain (CIFAR-10). Would it not make more sense to test directly on ImageNet? Improvements would be directly comparable with the original pre-trained model.\n\nEDIT AFTER REBUTTAL: the authors have added several baselines and improved the presentation of the method. I have raised my score to 8."

To my understanding, Dynamic Perceiver is the most recent work in this field, achieving SOTA performance in dynamic early exiting.\n    \n2. **Overclaiming contributions**. Based on the above point, the contribution of this paper should not include a new architecture. It is recommended to summarize the contribution as the joint learning procedure only. I believe this would already be significant enough if the learning method is shown effective on more SOTA architectures and on the ImageNet dataset.\n\n3. **Lack of experiments on ImageNet**.

The use of learned early exiting gates and intermediate classifiers, trained jointly with the backbone is common practice for many early exiting architectures. After all the approximations described in 4.1, the loss term for the gating modules turnes into the common practice of summing the losses of independent binary early-exiting classifiers. The main task loss is similarly aligned with prior work from Han et al. (2022b).\n\n- Constructing surrogate binary targets for the learned gates is also common, e.g. FrameExit by Ghodrati et al. CVPR 2021. \n\n- Figure 2a) The fact that samples do not exit at all from the first few early exiting layers in JEI-DNN is puzzling and I am wondering if it is due to the choice of specific hyperparameters that prevent early exiting from these layers. As can be seen, the accuracy of the IM at layer 5 & 6 is far higher that the overall performance. It is conceivable that a good accuracy higher than the green dashed line is still achievable by the earlier classifiers at least for a proportion of samples. Is there any hyperparamer that could potentially give more control into the exiting pattens of JEI-DNN?\n\n\n- All the results in the paper are limited to the T2T-ViT backbone. The authors should show the efficacy of their method for a larger variety of backbones, preferably to models that are established in the early exiting literature such as MSDNet, DenseNet, etc.\n\n- Comparison of the accuracies among T2T-Vit and MSDNet architectures in Fig 5 seem unfair. Most of the gain in accuracy comes because of the more powerful transformer-based backbone and not because of the efficacy of the early exiting approaches. In fact, MSDNet and RANet show more robust early exiting results compared to the results reported for T2T. E.g. MSDNet retains the original accuracy of the model after almost 50% compression. The performance of the proposed JEI-DNN approach in comparison drops very rapidly even with 25% compression.\n\n- The method is only evaluated on three small-scale datasets: CIFAR10 & 100, SVHN. The authors should consider expanding the evaluation to ImageNet."
