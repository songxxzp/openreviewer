A set of fragments is constructed using the BRICS fragmentation method, which leverages chemical structures to define well-behaved fragments. The framework operates at two levels: first, it performs a message-passing step on the short-range graph, and then uses these results to define fragment-level features that are also message-passed at the fragment-level graph. The method demonstrates competitive accuracy on the MD22 benchmark, which contains large structures, and shows some improvements over short-range baselines."

                "value": "- The main weakness of the method, as shared in the paper, is the definition of fragments. First, as mentioned, it is not clear how to define these for most systems, including materials. My biggest concern is the issue of smoothness. In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is crucial to ensure that the predictions are smooth. I can envision many MD scenarios where such partitioning might cause problems, and I would be very interested in seeing the behavior of this model over long simulations.\n\n- The Equiformer and VisNet models have 4 layers with a 4\u00c5 cutoff, resulting in a receptive field of 32\u00c5 in diameter. Most of the MD22 molecules fit well within their receptive fields. While this does not detract from the improvement offered by the method, it should be clearly highlighted.\n\n- The importance of long-range effects beyond a 12\u00c5 radius is subtle, as large effects are usually screened in most systems. One would expect to see little difference in errors between a short-range and a long-range model. However, observables computed from MD simulations might vary significantly, as these long-range effects do not average out over long timescales. To capture these observables accurately, the most crucial factor is the decay of interactions, rather than raw accuracy. There is no reason to believe that your approach would correctly capture this decay, enabling accurate observables in these simulations. I want to stress that long-range effects in large biomolecular systems are mostly relevant for observables, and justifying the method solely through raw accuracy has limited scientific relevance.\n\n- One of the main challenges of long-range modeling is transferability, especially for models without typical decay behaviors. I would be very interested in seeing how this model extrapolates to longer, unseen molecules, and whether it performs better than a local model in this context. This is the only relevant setting for practical applications, particularly for modeling systems where ab initio computations are not feasible."

You could try separating two molecules and plotting the energy as a function of distance. Without sensible decay, the model stands little chance of extrapolating effectively."
