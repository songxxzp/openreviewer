(2) is not invariant to $u_x$ and $u_{xy}$, since it involves an expectation over $p(z_s \\mid x)$, which can shift across training and testing.\n\n2.

(Minor) The authors cite Kivva 2022 to claim that their standard normal prior $p(z_c)$ is a one-component Gaussian mixture, and therefore $z_c$ is identifiable (along w/ the piecewise affine decoder assumption). Calling a standard normal distribution a Gaussian mixture is technically true, but this identifiability argument is a bit tenuous."

                "value": "This paper aims to solve the problem of out-of-distribution classification using a causal approach. In the problem setting, the features $X$ are caused by causal latent variables $Z_C$ and spurious latent variables $Z_S$ and are correlated with labels $Y$ through both sets of latent variables. A typical classifier predicts $P(Y \\mid X)$, using the correlation through both $Z_S$ and $Z_C$. However, under distribution shift, the distribution of unobserved variables affecting $Z_S$ are changed, so using the spurious latent variables for classification can result in incorrect predictions out-of-distribution. Instead, the paper proposes using $P(Y \\mid X, do(Z_S))$ for classification, which severs the correlation between $Y$ and $X$ through $Z_S$ via a causal intervention, thus providing a quantity that is invariant across domains. Estimating this quantity requires learning encoders which map $X$ to $Z_C$ and $Z_S$, a decoder which maps $Z_S$ and $Z_C$ back to $X$, and a classifier $P(Y \\mid Z_C)$. This is done by optimizing over a variational bound on the log-likelihood of the data. After training, predictions are obtained by computing a linear combination of predictions from $P(Y \\mid Z_C)$ weighted by a value indicating the compatibility of $Z_C$ with $X$ (using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate expectations). Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."

                "value": "I am concerned about the soundness of some of the claims:\n\n1. The path from $U_{xy}$ to $Y$ is not influenced by any intervention on $Z_s$. Hence, if $p^s(U_{xy}) \\neq p^t(U_{xy})$, it should also be the case that $p^s(y \\mid x, do(z_s)) \\neq p^t(y \\mid x, do(z_s))$. This seems to contradict what is stated at the end of Sec. 3.1.\n\n2. It is not clear how calculating the expectation of $p(y \\mid x, do(z_s))$ over $p(z_s \\mid x)$ (as done so in Eq. 2) is considered marginalizing out $z_s$. It is also not clear why this is preferable to just choosing some arbitrary $z_s$ to intervene.\n\n3. How are $p(u_x)$ and $p(u_{xy})$ modeled in Eq. 3 if they are unobserved and change between source and target?\n\n4. What justifies that the learned representations $Z_S$ and $Z_C$ truly follow the causal diagram in Fig. 1? Given the generative process of learning these representations (i.e. through $q(z_s \\mid x)$ and $q(z_c \\mid x)$), it could be argued that $Z_S$ and $Z_C$ are caused by $X$ rather than the other way around. Further, it is difficult to believe that a learned representation can contain more information about $Y$ than $X$, but this is what is implied by the graph (i.e. $Y$ and $X$ are independent given $Z_S$ and $Z_C$ but $Y$ is not independent of $Z_S$ and $Z_C$ given $X$?).\n\nIn addition, there are a few points that could use more elaboration:\n\n5. At the beginning of Sec. 3.1, it is explained that the consideration of $U_x$ and $U_{xy}$ address two types of biases: selection bias and stereotype bias. This seems to be an interesting point and could be expanded.\n\n6. Under Alg. 1, the paper mentions the necessity of assumptions to compensate for the lack of observations of $Z$ and $U$. These should be explicitly stated, as this seems to be the crux of the reasoning behind why the model works. Further, are some of these assumptions only relevant to certain types of data (e.g. images)?\n\nI cannot recommend acceptance while I have these doubts, but I look forward to having them clarified in the authors\u2019 responses."
