The main idea is to use Gaussian process (GP) where subgoal z is represented as a Gaussian Process sample; the GP kernel function (e.g. Matern kernel) is learned to capture the intrinsic structure of the (latent) state space. Learning of GP parameters can be done using Bayesian inference so as to satisfy temporal consistency in the low-level state transitions and maximize the distance in the high-level state transitions. The resulting algorithm, HSSR, can learn latent subgoal representations in stochastic (and deterministic) environments efficiently."

The choice of Matern kernel for Gaussian Process sounds good and looks reasonable; it allows a nice, learnable control of smoothness and continuity. The formulation makes sense and learning of Gaussian kernel hyperparameters based on the learning objective is simple, technically sound, and well-motivated.\n\n\n3. Overall, experimental results seem good and promising. The downstream task learning performance with the representation learned can outperform existing baselines.

This seems to be an unrealistic setting that might be too advantageous for the method.\n\n- First of all, it seems that the experiment settings can only deal with local, independent Gaussian noises rather than the inherent uncertainty that is a result of lack of exploration (i.e. unexplored state space).\n\n- Second, why not perturbing the entire state space? I'm also not sure how much stochasticity \\sigma=0.1 adds -- Figure 6(Left) suggest that LESSON with \\sigma=0.1 doesn't degrade as much compared to the fully deterministic case -- \\sigma=0.0, whereas 0.15 can significantly hurt LESSON; so I doubt that sigma=0.1 is a noise that is high enough that would make existing baselines. I think this work should show more clear evidence that HSSR can deal with stochastic noise compared to the baselines (than what is shown in Figure 6).\n\n\n- Minor: Plots (especially Figure 6) are difficult to read, the plot should introduce more smoothing and post-processing. Regarding Figure 6(Left), it's very difficult to examine the effect of the stochasticity (different \\sigma values).\n\n\n- Minor nitpicking: The introduction section deserves a separate, numbered section. \"Preliminaries\" should start as a section 2, and 3. Method, etc.\n- Minor nitpicking: The Matern kernel should have an equation number, say (2). Many equations throughout the paper (especially in Section 2.4) also lack the equation number. \n\n\n- Section 2.3 and Equation (3) could benefit from more clarity: e.g. writing more explicitly what each of the term is trying to do. For instance, \"minimizes the distance between low-level state transitions in the latent subgoal space\" could be accompanied more directly with ||z_i - z_{i+1}||, etc."

Why not simply have the form like \\Delta_f^1  - \\Delta_f^k + \\Delta_z^1 - \\Delta_z^k with some weight coefficients?\n\n\n- Figure 6(Left) should also include HESS which is the strongest baseline other than LESSON.
