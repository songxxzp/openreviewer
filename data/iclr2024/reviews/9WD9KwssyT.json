This is not by itself disqualifying; it is the nature of the field that SOTA systems are often published without source code.  However, I expect that future work iterating on this design will struggle with direct comparison, much in the same way that this paper compares to a weaker reproduction of the original Conformer."

I think the authors should consider including a variant of Zipformer with ~120M parameters, as originally used by Gulati et al.   This would prevent the suspicion that the stronger WER simply reflects the fact that the Zipformer is larger.\n\nStill, I think Zipformer's substantially reduced computational needs demonstrate that superiority over Conformer does not only reflect model size.  So, I'll recommend this paper for acceptance despite the flaw in this comparison."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "From my biased view, the major weakness in this paper lies in the fact that this work actually presents two inter-connected but (arguably) separate works: one is to the novel new encoder structure, including the U-net with middle stacks operate at a lower frame rates, sharing the attention weight with two self attentions, a novel non-linear attention, a BiasNorm and a slightly modified swooshL/swooshR activation function; the other is about the modified Adam optimizer, scaledAdam, which the authors claim that it can explicitly learn the parameter scale, which the widely used adam failed to. Though the author gives some motivations behind these changes and give some ablation studies, it still points to the following unanswered questions: \n\n  - the authors claim that the zipformer is better than the (reproduced) conformer, squeezeformer or other variants of transformer. However, it is unclear to me whether this is because of the model structure or because of the modified optimizer ? For example, in Table 5, the author presents that with all the proposed change (model and optimizer), zipformer-M can achieve 4.79% WER on test-other, however, with the standard adam optimizer, the WER becomes 5.51%. Will the other variants of transformer get better WER with the author proposed optimizer ? \n\n  - On the other hand, I am wondering whether the proposed optimizer, which has many adhoc modifications compared with the much widely used adam optimizer, can be more widely used for other deep learning optimization tasks or does it only work for speech tasks or does it only work for zipformer ? Given the zipformer-L is a pretty small model (only 60M parameters) trained on limited data (<1000hrs) according to today's standard,  will the proposed change still work better than the standard adam when the model and the training data scales up? \n\n\nOther weakness of this paper include: \n\n  - The authors propose changes to many widely used components, which have been well tested over time and over different tasks beyond just speech recognition. For example, the authors claim that the mean extraction in layer norm is not necessary and also remove the variance normalization. While this may seem to work for authors use case, I am intrigued to learn how generalizable this claim can be. \n\n  - Some of the proposed modification seem arbitrary. It would be great if the authors can explain a bit. For example, in Eq (4), for the swooshR and swooshL functions, how the -0.08 is selected ? The authors mentioned that the coefficient 0.035 in Eq (4) is slightly tuned. How general is this parameter ? \n\n- In the ablation study, quite a few modifications results in less than 0.2% absolute WER change. How sensitive of the WERs on librispeech relative to other factors like checkpoint choosing, different training run with different seed ? In my own experiments, these factors can result in up to 0.1% WER changes.\n\n\n- The authors also miss a series of work in the literature that directly apply standard transformer (without much modification) for ASR. For example, \n   * Y. Wang, A. Mohamed, D. Le, C. Liu et al., \u201cTransformer-based Acoustic Modeling for Hybrid Speech Recognition,\u201d in Proc ICASSP, 2020, it reports a WER of 2.26% / 4.85% on test-clean/test-other of librispeech, achieved by CTC + external NNLM; \nThis is followed by a work in: \n  * Zhang, Frank, et al. \"Faster, simpler and more accurate hybrid asr systems using wordpieces.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.09150 (2020).\nwhich achieves a WER of 2.10% and 4.20% using a similar architecture. \n\nIt is also noted that in \n\n- Wang, Y., Chen, Z., Zheng, C., Zhang, Y., Han, W. and Haghani, P., 2023, June. Accelerating rnn-t training and inference using ctc guidance. In ICASSP 2023-2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) (pp. 1-5). IEEE.\n\nIt achieved almost the same WER as the initial conformer paper, but part of the conformer layers (10 out of total 17 layers) is running at much lower frame rate (about 120ms-160ms per frame). This is related to the temporal downsampling used in zipformer."

E.g. introducing a new optimizer (ScaledAdam) is interesting, but it should be tested on a couple of different models and benchmarks, and this would basically a work on its own. Now we have way too little analysis for each of the introduced methods to really tell how good they are. The ablation study is basically only a single experiment, showing ScaledAdam vs Adam, or LayerNorm vs BiasNorm. A single experiment is not really enough to really see how ScaledAdam vs Adam performs, or BiasNorm vs LayerNorm, etc. E.g. replaying LayerNorm by BiasNorm in a standard Transformer, maybe for language modeling, how would this perform? Many of these introduced methods seem to be quite orthogonal to each other.\n\n- For comparisons, it would have been better to use a more standard transducer, not a pruned transducer. Or maybe even CTC, or CTC/AED. This would have made it easier to compare the results to other results from the literature (Table 2).\n\n- Measuring just FLOPs can sometimes be misleading as indicator for speed, because certain operations might be faster than others, and certain operations can be executed in parallelized, while others can not. It would be interesting to also see the actual measured speed on some given hardware.\n\n- No systematic comparison to other Conformer variants, e.g. E-Branchformer, etc. (I don't just mean to have the number from literature as a comparison, as done in Table 2. I mean that the differences are compared, i.e. discussed and maybe also experimentally compared.)"

What batch sizes are used?\n\n\n> Downsample module averages every 2 frames with 2 learnable scalar weights (after softmax normalization)\n\nI don't exactly understand how this is done. For the whole module, there are two learnable scalar weights only? So it could learn to always take really the average, but also to always take the first and ignore the second, or vice versa? This does not make sense to me. Why does it make sense to learn that? What happens if you just take the average? Or maybe use max-pooling instead? What is the influence of this?\n\n\nIf you downsample at the very end to 25 Hz, why not do that earlier, and downsample right in the beginning to 25 Hz, and then never to 50 Hz again? That would make it quite a bit faster. So how much worse does this get?\n\n\nLayerNorm/BiasNorm: When there is a large value, as even explicitly modelled by the bias in BiasNorm, isn't this a problem, that there is a large number in the denominator, so then all the values become very small? The exp(\u03b3) can compensate that then again, however, I wonder if there are numerical problems.\n\nWhat is the influence of exp(\u03b3) vs just \u03b3 (without exp) in BiasNorm?\n\n\nHow does ScaledAdam compare to methods like WeightNorm, where the weights are also normalized?\n\n\n> Since Adam is nearly invariant to changes in the gradient scale, for simplicity we replace this with ht = gt \u00b7(rt\u22121 \u2299\u03b8t\u2032\u22121) = gt \u00b7\u03b8t\u22121\n\nI'm not sure that this would make the code simpler, to have this special case? But I also wonder, what is the influence of this?\n\n\nFor ScaledAdam, as I understand,\u00a0adding the learnable parameter scale would actually change the model, as this scale now is also part of the model? Is this added for every parameter, or only some selected ones, e.g. the linear transformations?\n\nWhat is the influence of the Eden learning rate scheduling?"
