The first contribution, introducing the application of an interior point method (IP) for constrained optimization, represents a straightforward but meaningful addition from an optimization standpoint. Similarly, the second contribution involving the incorporation of neural network (NN) layers into constraints is conceptually clear-cut. \n\n- **Scalability**: The optimization problem defined in equation 15 encompasses all NN layers and parameters, potentially leading to scalability challenges. The authors acknowledge this concern in Section 4.3 and propose heuristics to partially address it. Nonetheless, it is plausible that this issue may persist despite these mitigating measures. The experimental results also reflect this, as the use of a neural network with just one hidden layer took a considerable amount of time to train, surpassing 14,000 seconds. This highlights a critical scalability concern that may limit the practical applicability of the proposed method.\n\n- **Limited experiments**: The validation of the proposed method exclusively on a single dataset may be insufficient to establish its robustness and generalizability. It is advisable to broaden the experimental scope by evaluating the approach across multiple datasets. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its performance under diverse conditions and enhance the overall confidence in the proposed methodology. Expanding the experimental validation to encompass a wider range of scenarios would strengthen the empirical foundation of the study."

The proposed approach builds on previous work that trains a linear model by solving an optimization problem that identifies the best linear model leading to high-quality downstream decisions as evaluated by the true objective coefficients. The authors extend this work by proposing a method for finding the best neural network parameters that lead to high quality downstream decisions. The proposed approach formulates this end-to-end pipeline as an optimization problem which is solved using an interior point method which maintains a current solution, comprised of neural network weights, and iteratively updates the solution to trade off avoiding constraint violation versus rewarding higher-quality solutions. The authors compare three versions of their approach for training both neural networks as well as linear models against three previous approaches: an implicit differentiation approach with quadratic smoothing, a subgradient approach, and a subgradient approach with reformulation. They evaluate these methods on one real world dataset for optimal scheduling of energy storage. The results demonstrate that their approach improves over the baselines in performance while it does take extensive time to train. \n\nWith the main strength being the novelty of the approach, there are several limitations in the method and empirical evaluation. If these are addressed, I am happy to increase my score."

Proper combination of these two has the potential to tightly integrate the learning and optimization components for improved performance as suggested in this work.\n\nThe method additionally does seem to give improved performance over the investigated baselines in a realistic setting.

The authors hint that this might be alleviated by using minibatches which seems reasonable in that they could simply iterate by optimizing over a minibatch of problem instances from one iteration to the next. It would be great to understand whether using minibatches improves or harms the training performance as it may make the training process more unstable. \n\nIn the evaluation, there are a number of aspects that would improve the paper.\n\nIt would be helpful to evaluate the proposed approach against the relevant baselines. For instance, it would be helpful to compare against the other interior point method for decision-focused learning, in the cited Mandi & Guns 2020 paper. Additionally, consider evaluating against the implicit MLE paper [1], differentiable perturbed optimizers [2], dfl without optimization [3], and using CvxpyLayers [4]. \n\nFurthermore, it would be helpful to evaluate some of the LP-based settings used in previous work. For instance, the bipartite matching setting from the cited Wilder et al. 2018, the warcraft path planning setting from [5], or the shortest path setting from the cited Mandi and Guns 2020 paper. Since the evaluation is solely empirical, it would help to further improve the empirical evaluation by demonstrating that the method works in more settings.\n\n\n\n[1] Niepert, Mathias, Pasquale Minervini, and Luca Franceschi. \"Implicit MLE: backpropagating through discrete exponential family distributions.\" NeurIPS (2021) \n\n[2] Berthet, Q., Blondel, M., Teboul, O., Cuturi, M., Vert, J.

It seems that it requires taking the dual of the downstream optimization problem. Would it be readily applicable for prediction plus optimization for quadratic programs? Is it possible to extend this framework to differentiation of nonlinear optimization problems?\n\nWhy is time bolded for the proposed method when it seems to consistently have high running times especially when compared to the implicit differentiation method?\n\n\nWhat is the impact of penalizing the difference between the initial predictions in the formulation? It seems that this is present only for the proposed method but not for the baselines whereas the penalty term could be easily added to the implicit differentiation method by adding a penalty term. It might help to preform an ablation study to understand the impact of training using IP versus adding a penalty for deviating from the initial prediction. For instance, this deviation could also be used for the ID models by adding a loss that penalizes deviation from the initial cost prediction. \n\nAlong the lines of using a pretrained model, does the cold start method have access to the predictions of the pretrained model as it is solving 15? Do the other methods have access to the pretrained model as well in the cold start?"

As one way of approaching this problem, a previous work has used a subgradient methods to minimize a convex surrogate of the regret loss. This work proposes an interior point method to solve the forecaster training problem that avoids overfitting by tracking the validation regret obtains by different iterates. An advantage of this approach is that it can accomodate training of neural network forecasters."

                "value": "1. The problem that the authors study--broadly, how to solve optimization problems by machine learning forecasters, is an important and broadly applicable problem. Practitioners from economics and operations research often interested in problems of this flavor, and it's great that this work aims to develop algorithms that can incorporate flexible forecasters to solve optimization problems.\n\n2. The authors do a good job of summarizing and contextualizing previous work, and they carefully distill the shortcomings of previous approaches.\n\n3. The idea of using a \"validation performance tracking procedure,\" inspired by early stopping, is a simple data-driven approach for preventing overfitting. A common concern in solving data-driven constrained optimization problems is that the solution to the problem may not generalize well out-of-sample. I think this procedure offers a simple, transparent, and promising approach of preventing over-fitting. It's an idea that has come to mind before but I actually haven't seen it formally written up in any works so far. Although the idea is simple, I think this idea could be very useful strategy for handling overfitting in constrained optimization problems, and I would like to see this idea developed with more careful theory in future works.\n\nOverall, I recommend to accept this paper and am willing to raise my score if the authors adequately address the questions listed below. This paper tackles an important and challenging problem, and the ideas that they propose (1) a validation performance tracking strategy to evaluate iterates of an interior point method (2) using interior-point methods to facilitate using neural network forecasters as part of optimization problems--are promising and have the potential to be useful in practice."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. One weakness of this paper is that the authors do not provide very much theoretical justification for why their validation performance tracking procedure may yield improved out-of-sample performance. As a result, the strategy that they propose is largely a heuristic. That being said, I think this heuristic is quite promising and I would hope that future works can develop a rigorous theory to justify this approach.\n\n2. There are some clarity concerns that I had (see questions below), but I believe that these can be addressed with proper writing and motivation.\n\n3. The authors demonstrate a nice proof-of-concept, but I would be interested in seeing a more thorough empirical evaluation, even on synthetic optimization problems."

                "value": "1. It is somewhat unclear what \"the ERM\" is in the following sentence in the introduction ``Secondly, the ERM can be re-written to a single-level\noptimization program by applying duality theory`` -- what ERM problem are the authors referring to? The problem of training the forecaster? The problem of minimizing the regret loss? While this is clarified later in the paper, it would be helpful to make this clear in the introduction as well.\n\n2. In equation 4, the set $S$ is not yet defined? I assume that $S$ is the feasible set for $x$. From the example in Equation 1, I presume that $S = \\{ x \\mid Ax \\geq b}.$ I think it would be helpful if the authors could reiterate the downstream optimization task again in Section 3 for clarity.\n\n3. Do the authors have any intuition on why training a neural network to minimize the SPO+ loss function $l^{SPO+}$ performs poorly?\n\n4. How does the validation performance tracking procedure that the authors propose compare to just solving the original SPO+ problem (Equation 9) with regularization?\n\n5. Could the authors elaborate more on the following sentence: ``We argue\nthat when the optimization program is an ERM for training a forecaster, the points on the central\npath should be regarded as actual intermediate solutions to be tested on the validation set\"?\n\n6. The authors make the following comment: ``Since the proposed methodology currently does not involve mini-batches, the IP solution method processes all the train data in a single run.``\nDo the authors think it would be possible to implement a ``stochastic`` version of the IP method where a new mini-batch of data could be used to solve for each the optimal parameters in each iteration of the interior-point method? Could this also prevent overfitting? Or do the authors expect this approach to be unstable?\n\n7. The idea of warm-starting the forecaster by first fitting the forecaster with the MSE loss is another useful heuristic--this one is probably used in various prior works. Also, it would great if the authors could comment on how much benefit is derived from each stage of training (how far does fitting with the MSE loss get you? how much additional benefit does the IP method provide?). Is the forecaster that is fit with the MSE loss the ``Initial FC`` in Table 1? In addition, the authors comment that a ``refined`` set of features are used to train the second-stage forecaster, how is this refined set of features selected? Also, could the authors add citations to other works that use the warm-start strategy? \n\n8. I am struggling to interpret Figure 2. Could the authors explain the difference betwen the SP-R-IP methods they evaluate in the experiments? What is the expected behavior under each of these 3 different algorithms? Are they all variants on the authors' proposed approach? What is the reason that the validation regret of SP-R-IPs and SP-R-IPd oscillates (instead of decreasing monotonically)?"
