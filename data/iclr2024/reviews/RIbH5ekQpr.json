The subjectivity of image polysemy amplifies all these difficulties. I wonder to what degree this task is even _possible_ to evaluate objectively. For example, it was not obvious to me that the caption and images in Fig 4. Col1 & Col 4 go together. Similarly for many of pairs in Fig 3. \n\nThe subjectiveness of this benchmark calls for a human accuracy check, given that this benchmark is so heavily based on human judgements of image meaning. The human judgements of similarity can then be used to create similarity judgements similar to [1,2] or correct false negatives. Given the dataset construction technique, I'm skeptical whether the evaluations are meaningful given that the captions are abstract enough that many of the might match plausibly match to other images. This could be corrected by verifying human accuracy on the dataset and modifying the benchmark so that correlation with human accuracy is being assessed instead.\n\nNote that the annotation process _does not_ guarantee this, since the annotation procedure does not exclude the possibility that there are 10-15 other captions somewhere in the dataset that describe the image equally well, and vice versa for any image. You could do this by using CLIP to rank _all_ the captions in the dataset w.r.t to a particular image (and vice versa), and having humans rerank the top 50 from each cluster. This could be used to measure both human accuracy, and capture more plausible measurements of human similarity. \n\n\n[1] ECCV Caption: Correcting False Negatives by Collecting Machine-and-Human-verified Image-Caption Associations for MS-COCO\n[2]  Crisscrossed captions: Extended intramodal and intermodal semantic similarity judgments for ms-coco"

The CLIP contrastive loss encodes distances only in the angular difference of the embeddings, so the embedding norms should not contribute to the analysis unless there's a good reason to.\n    - If the used embeddings correspond to CLIP's normalized inner product space, then we also have to be careful about applying any sort of euclidean analysis, because the clustering from the learned representation probably lies on the surface of the N-dimensional normalized sphere.\n- Is it possible to verify that there is no dataset leakage in the zero-shot analysis? Based on my understanding of the dataset collection pipeline, there should be existing captions from previous datasets such as MSCOCO and FLICKR30K included in this dataset, with possibly different image pairings. Can we confirm that none of the pre-trained models have been exposed to MSCOCO or FLICKR30k?"

My major concern is in the characterization of polysemy, which is not much beyond \u201cnon-descriptive\u201d. For instance, does any kind of image-text correspondence ontology emerge? Perhaps this needs human classification of (a subset) captions into a pre-defined categories, or automatically clustering captions, etc. This is especially important since quantitatively MPL2D cannot distinguish noise from diversity. Finally, I would also like to see further statistics beyond word lengths (word clouds, token/type ratio, etc. that would lead us to have a clearer picture of how this dataset is more diverse than existing ones. \n\n- W2: The tasks that perform on this dataset are standard image- and text- retrieval tasks with zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluation. Further, an adaptation of models that address image polysemy does not lead to improved performance (see, e.g., SE models in Table 4). These experiments are a good start but the paper would be stronger with additional tasks that focus on measuring model\u2019s capability in addressing polysemy such as image captioning generation given a \u201ccaption sense\u201d.\n\n- W3: Besides improving the analysis in W1 above, the discussion of image-text datasets can also be further expanded to include additional datasets in the analysis, including RedCaps and SBU captions. \n\n- W4: Clarity on the data collection process is quite obscure (under Table 4). IMO, it is important to include the details on the database used to retrieve captions (CC3M and CC12M) in the main text so the reader is well-informed about the bias of these captions. In addition, it is important to include the details on how the authors optimize for diversity and quality control."

                "value": "**A.** It seems that the \u201cimage polysemy\u201d considered in this paper mainly means: the model should have the ability to match images to both \u201cdescriptive\u201d and \u201cconceptual\u201d captions; previous datasets such as COCO contains mainly descriptive captions.\n\nHowever, I am not fully convinced that the collected datasets have more \u201cconceptual\u201d captions than the web image-text data such as CC3M, since many of the captions in the dataset come from web data. The MPL2D also does not indicate that the collected dataset is more \u201cconceptual\u201d.\n\nThe only advantage of the dataset seems to be that it has multiple captions per image while CC3M/12M does not. But if the final goal is to teach a model to match an image to descriptive / conceptual captions, then it is not clear why it is necessary to have multiple captions per image for training; as long as CC3M has a lot of conceptual & descriptive captions, then the model can learn to retrieve both types captions. \nE.g., say there is a dataset A with 1K images each with 5 captions; suppose a dataset B with 5K images each with 1 caption. The captions in A and B are identical. Then I do not see the necessity of training on A if we have dataset B.\n\nIn sum, it would be better if the paper could illustrate either a) why / how the dataset has more diverse / conceptual captions than CC3M or b) the importance of having multiple captions per image. \n\n**B.** The experiments are not very insightful. While the problem of image polysemy is interesting, the paper simply evaluates/fine-tunes current models with image-text retrieval on the collected datasets. The take-away conclusion seems to be that the task is hard and larger models perform better. \nI would expect more analysis and discussions on why and how studying image polysemy could benefit future vision-language models and how to model such a phenomena. For example, does explicitly modeling image polysemy benefit other tasks that could require high-level conceptual understanding (e.g., understanding actions, events, memes, etc)?\n\n**C.** For the image-to-text retrieval evaluation, how does this test model\u2019s ability to handle image polysemy? If I understand it correctly, as each image has 5 matching captions, as long as the model retrieves 1 of the matching captions, then it is counted as correctly retrieved? Then the evaluation protocol does not test whether the model handles polysemy; if for most images, at least 1 of the captions is \u201cdescriptive\u201d, then a model that only \u201cunderstands\u201d descriptive captions will still score high on image-to-text retrieval.\n\n**D.** For comparing the dataset with CC3M/CC12M on MPL2D, why not treat the collected dataset as a single caption dataset (either downsample to one caption per image or just \u201cduplicate\u201d the images)? \n\nIn addition, I am not sure about the takeaway message by comparing MPL2D: is higher MPL2D score better or lower score better? On the one hand, if there are more diverse / conceptual captions, the score is higher; on the other hand, if the captions are noisier, the score is also higher. Thus, a lower/higher score could be attributed to these two possible factors and we cannot make a conclusion."
