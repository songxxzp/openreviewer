While it can be used, it is very difficult for me to judge its importance and the paper doesn't really help that much. The processing carbohydrate data is \"more complicated than protein data, and requires substantial domain knowledge\". The comparison with protein data, making protein data \"much easier\" to work with is not concrete enough. These claims require some evidence to back it up, otherwise, rather hollow. \n\nThe first database is extracted from Glycosciences.DB with \"domain expertise and efforts\". I think this is true for any database extraction, and not any extraction can be that significant. The second database of simulation also needs to show its significance. Does it requires a massive computing power that costs millions of dollar or can be finished in a PC in a couple of hours? In the end, I am still not sure these databases how much effort, is that absolute necessary to generate once and just once for all, or it can be done by most people in the field? How does this work help the field? Is it irreplaceable? \n\nAnother thing is to show an example of how useful the database is in some problem. The paper keeps talking about chemical shifts problem without a background that is useful for those who do not work on this problem."

The introduction is very extensive (the own contributions basically start at page 5), but in section 3 at page 5 it is only mentioned that substantial domain expertise is required to annotate and process the data from Glyco-sciences.DB. This makes it hard to reproduce the methods and also to evaluate the contribution (Glyco-sciences.DB -> GlycoNMR.Exp). Also the sentence in the middle of page 6 \"we had to utilize domain knowledge to reduce such ambiguities as much as possible when handling...\" is not really describing a procedure in a reproducible manner. It is clear that not all domain knowledge can be described, but one could spend more space on the own contributions and less on the general introduction (currently 4 pages).\n\nFurthermore, the simulated part of the data base is a little bit more problematic, since one model (GODESS) is used directly. It is questionable if ML models trained on the simulated data can learn important parameters that are not already known from GODESS. For a performance comparison of different models the data set might still be valuable, with the remark that GODESS might produce a biased view of the real world in which some methods perform worse than they would perform on real data (and we cannot judge, because we do not know the biases of the individual methods)."
