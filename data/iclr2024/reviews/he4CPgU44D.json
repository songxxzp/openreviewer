The paper considers a variety of continual learning settings, including domain-incremental, class-incremental and task-incremental learning, and examines aspects such as the balance between forgetting and learning in CL aided by active learning. The authors conduct experiments in six benchmark datasets + tasks, including P-MNIST, MNIST and CIFAR-10, and over a range of state-of-the-art continual learning methods for regularization and example replay. In the experiments, the authors examine the performance of these methods integrated with the ACL proposed approach, and compare this to joint learning and multitask learning with respect to overall accuracy, forgetting, and learning-forgetting profile."

What is the meaning of this? Similarly, all the dots representing different strategies make it very difficult to grasp what is the actual performance of each of the selected methods with each of those strategies. I would strongly suggest to find a much better representation. \n- Although the selected datasets are CL benchmarks, these are also the easiest ones. I would have expected to see experimental results on more challenging datasets such as CIFAR-100, some version of ImageNet (tiny-ImageNet, mini-ImageNet), etc. Furthermore, from Figure 3 and 4, it seems that for the slightly more challenging datasets and tasks (P-MNIST, CIFAR-10 CIL, TIL), all the ACL methods perform substantially badly, therefore raising questions on the actual effectiveness of CL combined with active learning, and the significance of the proposed approach.\n- A final remarkable weakness that I see in this paper is the limited number of tasks in the experiments. I would expect that active selection of examples would be significantly more difficult as the number of tasks increases, and therefore would have expected to see results along these lines."
