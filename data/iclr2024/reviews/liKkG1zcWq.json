                "value": "The paper proposed a improved denoising pretraining method for 3D GNN in molecular machine learning tasks. The proposed method, called sliced denoising (SliDe), is inspired by classical intramolecular potential theory. SliDe adds different levels of noise to the length of bonds, the magnitude of angles, and the magnitude of torsion angles. Through a series of theoreticall derivation, the authors demonstrate the equivalence of SliDe method and learning the molecular force field. Lastly, the authors show that the SliDe has outperformed previous denoising training methods on the QM9 and MD17 dataset."

Comparing to previous work such as the Fractional Denoising, the noise designing of this work is a more \"physical\" formulation because changing either one of the bond length, angle degree, or torsion angle degree does not affect the rest. \n\n2. The writing and proof process are of high clarity. \n\n3. Some efforts to the direction of explainablity are interesting. For example, the correlation coefficient between the learned force field and ground-truth force field (Table 1) is a nice way to quantified the learned force field."

                "value": "1. In section 3.1, the claim above Eq. 6 is not correct. Modeling long-range electrostatic (coulomb) interaction is critical in many areas including energy calculation and md simulation. For large system, long-range vdW outside of a cutoff distance may be neglected, but for small molecules in QM9 and MD17, it should not be neglected. When using GNN that takes 3D coordinate and atom type as input approximate energy function, the model should be able to learn those two terms, thus not affecting the approximation of Eq.6. However, the authors should rephrase the sentence. The two citations associated with the sentence does support the claim so they should be removed.\n\n2. The noise design is very import in this work. In the BAT noise (Eq. 9), the parameter vectors are critical but there isn't detailed explaination of them. The authors briefly discussed in the section C.1, but I do think more details and example of those parameter vectors can substentially help reader in understanding the noise design. \n\n3. Missing parenthesis in the second exponential term of Eq. 8. $(\\theta_{i} - \\theta_{i, 0})^2$\n\n4. I do think the superiority of the SliDe method can be strengthen by more downstream experiments, especially energy prediction. For example, the ANI-1x dataset (www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0473-z) is a excellent dataset for such task."
