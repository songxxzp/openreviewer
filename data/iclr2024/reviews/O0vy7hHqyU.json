                "value": "Inspired by the fake news detection task, the paper investigates the use of simulated annealing to perform selection of text and image features while training a multimodal neural network. The proposed framework, Adaptive Feature Matching Optimization (AFMO), consists of extracting text and image features using well-known pretrained models (BERT and VGG), removing sample outliers, and then training a feed-forward neural network while the set of active features in the input is modified by an algorithm whose proposals are accepted or rejected through simulated annealing (SA) based on the loss. The fraction of features which are \"flipped\" in the proposal decreases from 1.0 to 0.0 linearly as the temperature goes from t0 to tmin. The authors evaluate AFMO performance for text-only data on PolitiFact and for image+text data on Gossipcop and one of the Weibo datasets. The results indicate that AFMO outperforms all the baselines w.r.t. Accuracy, Recall and F1-score."

Please address the following concerns:\n- For KNN, you don't need to normalize the dimensions by variance?\n- Which multimodal Weibo dataset did you use? Jin et al., 2017 or Zhang et al., 2021a?\n- Why the statistics in Table 2 do not match those in other papers (see Shu et al. 2018)? Is it showing the reduced data? Could this also explain the discrepancies between the results in Tables 4-5 and those in Hu et al., Deep learning for fake news detection: A comprehensive survey, AI Open, 2022?\n- Does AFMO reduce to a BERT classifier when there is only textual data? If so, what could explain the fact that such simple model it is outperforming all the baselines on PolitiFact by a wide margin; don't you need to include a stronger baseline (e.g., dEFEND)? Or does AFMO still includes the feature selection step?\n\nQ3. What is the performance gain of the feature selection step? What are potential alternatives for feature selection?\n\nQ4.
