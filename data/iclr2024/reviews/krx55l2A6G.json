For example, it is until the description of the SEER attack that the authors mention the availability of auxiliary data at the server, which is not always required by other attacks and can be a strong assumption. \n2.\tLack of details: it is not clear what are the exact client-side checks the malicious server needs to evade; it is also not clear what do the authors mean by \u201chandcrafted modifications\u201d. Why is SEER\u2019s mode not handcrafted? The descriptions of the necessary conditions at the end of section 3 are too vague, not to mention providing any theoretical or experimental proofs for those.\n3.\tIt is not clear how SEER exactly breaks through secure aggregation.\n4.\tQuality and quantity of auxiliary data are key to the performance of SEER. More discussions and ablation studies are needed on auxiliary data.\n5.\tComplexity issue. Algorithm 1 needs to be repeated for each sample in the batch (i.e., retrain a set of models for each property). This incurs high computational complexity, and should be evaluated carefully and compared with baselines.\n6.\tNo evaluations of SEER and baselines under defenses, which is supposed to be the main motivation of the paper.\n7.\tThe results in Table 3 are quite counter-intuitive and curious.

Subsequently, the authors outline a set of requirements for future realistic MS attacks. They then present a novel attack framework, SEER, which operates by disaggregating the gradients in a hidden space. Specifically, the SEER framework encompasses a shared model dispersed among clients for encoding gradients, a server-side disaggregator to nullify the contributions of images not satisfying the pre-defined property and a server-side reconstructor to reconstruct images that comply with the said property. The framework facilitates end-to-end training and presents a challenge for detection using D-SNR, in contrast to previous MS methods. Experiments also show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nThe main contributions of this work include a pioneering study of client-side detectability, the introduction of a novel detection metric, highlighting potential concerns for future MS, and the unveiling of a groundbreaking realistic MS approach."

Despite having relaxed some of the assumptions of previous work, the proposed attack is still somewhat restrictive in the sense that it requires multiple steps of offline training and an auxiliary dataset of sufficient size, and it is not very clear how to deploy such an attack during the federated learning process in practice. In particular, the joint optimization of the shared model seems to ignore the classification loss of the federated task, which might be leveraged to detect the attack in a retrospective way (e.g., a client may evaluate the local training loss before and after each update and choose to opt out of training if the loss is not reduced after several rounds). One reasonable strategy is to deploy the attack in the first round of training, i.e., substitute the random initialization with the optimized model weights, but this may still raise the alarm if it\u2019s beyond normal weight distributions. It would be better to add corresponding discussions and limitations.\n\n- It is not quite clear how to utilize the batch normalization statistics to design the local selection strategy of the property.\n\n- The proposed attack algorithm appears to be quite computationally expensive (~14 GPU days to train for ResImageNet).

It'd better to demonstrate the effectiveness of SEER on more tasks closer to real-world applications."
