The technical contribution is weak.\n\n(W2) Relying on BNS also limits the versatility of ZeroP (as also indicated in the Limitation section)\n\n(W3) If I understood correctly, the key challenge here is to search for PDs that mimic the distribution of the OD. In this case, using only BNS may not be necessary. Depending on the target task, there may be more information we could make use of, e.g. the class names of the target task. (If the finetuning involves a classification loss, this information may already be available.) With such information, instead of searching for a specific PD dataset, we could search for relevant samples via a text-based search engine, e.g. CLIP. \n\nOverall, the reviewer likes the idea of incorporating PD for zero-shot quantization, and also appreciates the superior performance of ZeroP. The reviewer has concerns about the technical contributions and the potential impacts of the paper. Therefore, the reviewer rates the paper as marginally below the acceptance threshold."
