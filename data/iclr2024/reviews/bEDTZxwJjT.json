It seems that Daras et al. (2022) can be used to solve inverse problems, in a non-blind formulation, similar to what this paper is proposing. Can the same strategy/sampling be used in this context? Additionally, I would like the authors to comment on how the present work compares to Delbracio and Milanfar (2023), since this work also discusses the advantage of their bridge formulation in terms of Perception-Distortion trade off. This work is also similar in the sense that requires to train a dedicated model for a specific degradation, and the convex combination formulation leads to a series of intermediate degraded images. This comment also applies to Bridge methods that are applied to solving inverse problems, as the one in Liu, G.H., et al $I^2$ SB: Image-to-Image Schr\\\" odinger Bridge, ICML 2023)\n\n2. **Experimental results**. The experimental results should also include methods that require training of finetuning a diffusion prior for solving a specific inverse problems as what the authors are proposing. I wouuld like the authors to comment on this point\n\n[After Rebuttal]\nMy concerns have been addressed so I'm updating my score to above acceptance threshold."

Specifically, it assumes the degradation model $A$ being a priori known, which is unrealistic in practical applications, even in the tasks of deblurring and inpainting considered in this paper. The provided experimental results are based on synthetic data, in which the degradation model $A$ can be easily specified. However, when considering practical tasks, I believe the proposed method would not perform satisfactorily, as it is hard or even impossible to accurately specify the degradation model $A$. The authors have not provided evaluation on practical tasks, e.g., practical deblurring and inpainting tasks, in comparison with representative methods.\n\n2. The proposed perception-distortion tradeoff method by early-stopping the reverse process is quite straightforward and heuristic.\n\n3. Experiment details are lacking in Appendix. It seems that the degradation function $A_t(\u00b7)$ is necessary in the training process. However, for the deblurring problem, $A(\u00b7)$ is unknown, only clean image $x$ and its degraded version $\\hat{x}$ are available. How to design $A_t(\u00b7)$ with only $x$ and $\\hat{x}$? \n\n4. In equation (10), the network learns to reconstruct $A_t(x0)$ rather than directly reconstructing $x_0$ or noise, compared with DDPM. However, when the degradation function $A_t(\u00b7)$ is linear, it would be equivalent to reconstructing $x_0$. In some tasks, the degradation model $A(\u00b7)$ would be linear, for example, the blur function $y=k*x + n$ in the deblurring task, where $k$ is a blur kernel. How can the deblurring experiment show the superiority of Dirac over DDPM when the degradation model $A(\u00b7)$ is linear?"
