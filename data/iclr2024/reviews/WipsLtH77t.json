Proposed method has been validated in Visual Genome dataset with two classic SGG baseline (MOTIF and VCTREE) and with four recent-most SGG baselines (Resam. IT-SGG, BGNN, and HetSGG). Proposed method increases the performance of the minority classes with slight decrease of majority classes."

Exploring vast un-annotated triplets in the image databases is one of the desired direction of open-set annotation dataset and Visual Genome is one of the most useful resources for conducting such exploration. This paper successfully established this motivation in their introduction. \n\n**2. Novel self-training loss:** The proposed simple yet novel and effective loss is one of the major strengths of the paper. The discussion regarding challenges of fixed-threshold based distinction between background class and un-annotated class is interesting and highly relevant. The proposed class-specific thresholding solves the problem efficiently and demands further exploration. \n\n**3. Less worsening of majority classes:** Traditional debiasing schemes of SGG usually hurt the recall classes significantly while improving the minority classes. However, this paper hurts the recall minimally, especially with the baseline MOTIF and VCTree. \n\n**4. Detailed ablation study on thresholding:** Since the main contribution of this paper is a threshold-based self-training algorithm, authors have performed detailed analysis on how to choose appropriate threshold."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "This paper has the following weaknesses\n\n**1. Comparison with other debiasing methods missing.** The paper demonstrated that their method can improve the diversity of the baseline models. However, such improvement of baseline models is prevalent in SGG literature now. Therefore, a direct comparison with other debiasing methods would shed light more on their performances. For example,  VCTree+ST-SGG should be compared with VCTree+Resample. With that comparison, the readers would have better understanding of their methods performance. \n\n**2. Zero-shot evaluation missing.** Since unannotated triplets are being accounted in the training, this method might improve the zero-shot performance of the baseline model as well. A separate study with zero-shot evaluation would strengthen the claim of the paper."

                "value": "The authors determine the threshold in an object-agnostic fashion considering only the relationship classes. However, the same relationship label has different semantic meaning to different pair and therefore an object-conditional viewpoint of relationship distribution may improve the result more. \n\nTo clarify more, in the loss calculation phase, if we consider the viability of a prediction conditioned on its object, we might have better choice on the threshold. For example, the prediction probability of 'on' will be higher for 'building-window' pair, however, it will be extremely low for 'man-pizza' pair. Is it possible to use such commonsense knowledge in the threshold choice of the loss equation?\n\n**Post-rebuttal rating:** My concerns and queries have been properly addressed and therefore, I keep my original rating of 8."
