In other words, the proposed method \"violently\" clusters the images, all based on pre-trained VLM and LLM. Though I acknowledge the good question and paradigm raised by this work, I feel it is better to incorporate some clustering techniques into the paradigm (maybe in future works).\n2. The refinement operation also seems a bit violent. It seems that if the user is not satisfied with the current clustering results, the whole process is simply repeated. I wonder if the refinement could integrate the experience learned from the last process.\n3. 100 samples from 10 location classes might have biases by random sampling. I suggest enlarging the datasets of location and mood so that they would become reliable benchmarks for future studies.\n4. What is the difference between sending the image description in step 1 and the main object in step 2 into step 3?\n5. There is a related recent work Image Clustering with External Guidance (arXiv 2023) that also leverages the text modality to enhance image clustering, which the authors are encouraged to include in the related works."

However, given that the method does not address the underlying representation, but just relies on the LLM to perform clustering as a black box, this is a minor concern.\n\nThe discussion of prior work in deep clustering is also very brief, and does not position the proposed contributions against current, relevant work. \n \nThe method requires prior specification of the number of clusters, which is a significant limitation and drawback. \n\nThe method is very simple, just a set of straightforward text prompts. The crucial step of doing the clustering is just deferred to the LLM itself, by asking it to cluster N labels into K categories. There is no significant algorithmic contribution here, and the paper is likely to be of little interest to the ICLR community."
