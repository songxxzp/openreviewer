                "value": "This paper provides a construction for a large transformer as a simulator, called TINT, such that it can simulate (on the auxiliary model / the smaller model) the forward pass, do back propagation to update the parameters, and then simulate another forward pass to output the final results. To improve the parameter efficiency, they provided the construction to approximate the layer norm, self-attention matrix, and their back-propagation process. Prior work focused on doing a forward pass one step of gradient descent on linear models or some much easier models, but they showed that actually a larger Transformer can simulate the forward and backward pass for another smaller Transformer. They showed that a GPT2 model can serve as a simulator to train a 125M OPT model in the forward  pass (of larger model) and showed that the perplexity can be improved by 0.3-0.7 on average.\n\nThis idea is very creative and worth investigating in the future. The theory result seems good and solid, but I still have some questions about the motivation and the theory part (see below). It is possible for me to change my score based on author's response and other reviewers' opinion."

The theory looks solid and correct, and the way to approximate linear Transformers using non-linear Transformers (especially the soft-max Transformers) is a topic that may be of separate interest of some community.\n\n3.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The theory part, although the proof seems correct, it is better to have a theorem to include all results of approximating each part of a forward/backward pass of fine-tune a Transformer. For example, this should look like 'there is a transformer with XXX layers and XXX heads, and XXX dimensions such that, when you have an auxiliary model with XXX layers/heads/dimension and a sequence of tokens, it can approximation the objective function (something you want to approximate in the forward pass of the simulator) with an error of at most epsilon'. I think adding a result like this in your main result section (section 2) after the basic setup is essential.\n\nThe most important issue in the theorem above is that how many parameters you need in the simulator Transformers to approximate the in-context learn the fine-tuning objective of the auxiliary Transformer (with XX parameters). The proportion of the number of parameters (parameter size of big TF / param size of auxiliary one) matters since you claim that your construction is more parameter efficient than the construction in previous works [1,2]. \n\nBased on the proportion of parameter size, you can then determine that in the experiments, in order to train an OPT model with 125M params in a single forward pass of the simulator, what size model do you need to use as a simulator.\n\n2. The structure of the paper, I believe, is not optimal, since you put lots of details of definitions and the results of approximating each part of TF in the main text, which I believe can be postponed to the appendix. This makes the paper harder to follow. I believe the authors may need to include more motivations and high-level description in the main text, as well as the the 'global theorem' I suggested in the first point. Then, the concrete way to approximating the back-propagation of soft-max and some details can be deferred in the appendix. I think the 'key component' section is especially hard to follow and I think maybe it will be slightly better to illustrate the structure of simulators in more detail in this subsection, instead of providing some formal definitions (like 2.3,2.6,2.7) in the main text (these are well-known definitions after all).\n\n3. Why do you want to implement/approximate the forward/backward pass of Transformers in-context? \n\nMy understanding is that, you want to do something like 'in-context fine-tuning' for Transformers, because by doing this in-context, you do not need to 'do actual parameter updates' (in classical fine-tuning procedure, you need to literally 'update the parameters'). Then, the natural question is: which is the better and more efficient way for fine-tuning ----- in-context fine-tuning or direct fine-tuning? \n\nIn the paper, the authors did not show **whether it is more computationally efficient for in-context fine-tuning than direct fine-tuning**. By in-context fine-tuning, you need to do a forward pass in a much larger model; and by direct fine-tuning, you need to compute the gradient and update the parameters. Which one need a smaller number of computation (in terms of FLOPS or other metrics)? \n\n4. Another question for the motivation: why do you use Transformers as the simulators? Are there any obvious reasons that make Transformer better than other architecture of Neural Networks here? Since what you want to do is to compute the forward/backward pass of the auxiliary Transformer in a single forward pass of the simulator model, which is a very complex task, why not considering other types of models as the outer simulator? I know that in some tasks that Transformers or attention models showed a better in-context learnability than CNN/RNN, but the tasks they considered are very much different from yours, so I am not sure whether this reason is sufficient enough.\n\n[1] Ekin Akyurek, Dale Schuurmans, Jacob Andreas, Tengyu Ma, and Denny Zhou.
