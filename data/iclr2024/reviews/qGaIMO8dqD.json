This is because the Transformers function $f_T$ and $f_C$ could be much more complex than a single transformer model.

                "value": "This paper made many simplified (possibly unrealistic) assumptions in its proposed theoretical framework and misses the connection to real-world tasks. \n- For example, the paper assumes a model is \"well trained\", meaning the model can memorize all answers perfectly. The authors claimed that this assumption is \"not challenging for the prevailing LLMs with a huge amount of parameters\", but many existing work has shown that even the largest models could struggle with tail knowledge [1].\n- The hierarchical extension assumes a model can decompose complex tasks well into sub-template and sub-content. But as the sub-template and sub-content can have many different combinations (especially if they are in slightly different forms as defined in Appendix A.1, based on label consistency), it is unrealistic to assume that the model is able to search in this combinatorial space efficiently and find the right template/content combination, especially when the task is very complex. Thus the presented theory in its current form, doesn't seem to be sufficient in explaining model's ability to solve very complex tasks.\n\n[1] Kandpal et al. Large Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge. ICML 2023.\n\nIn addition, the experiments are rather weak and do not support the theoretical part very well. \n- The two tasks used are very simple tasks, last-letter-concat and SingleEQ. In order to support the authors' claim on the *flexibility* and *generalizability* of this framework, a slightly more complex task should be presented as well. For example, on slightly more difficult algorithmic reasoning tasks like GSM8K or AQuA, can the hierarchical T-C be used to explain model's reasoning?\n- The results on T/C classification is a bit ad-hoc. Based on Figure 4 right, 1) as the authors mentioned, some green bars are too short to see, so it is unclear which model \"exhibits the clearest T/C distinction\"; 2) can the authors provide more quantitative analysis on the ratio between the green/blue bars? from the 2nd figure and the 3rd figure, the ratios seem not very significantly different, so I'm not sure if one can indeed judge a model has a better \"reasoning capability\" from those ratios.\n- In Figure 5, even on the simple SingleEQ task, the proposed classification already conflicts with the human intuition, so I'm not sure if this can be used in practice, especially for more complex reasoning tasks. Also on this task, the authors define content as \"names, objections, and Arabic numbers\", this also seems very ad-hoc and how can one apply this in general for any tasks?\n\n\nMissing references, the following paper also discusses how text (similar to the \"content\" part defined in this paper) and patterns (similar to the \"template\" part defined in this paper) affect reasoning performance in language models:\n- Text and Patterns: For Effective Chain of Thought, It Takes Two to Tango.
