            "questions": {
                "value": "It would be appreciated if the authors could clarify the following points.\n\n1. One of the main weaknesses of the paper is that only the discrete alphabet is considered, which is not a realistic case. This limitation is mentioned only once in the Preliminary Section. However, it must also be emphasized in the abstract and the introduction. How the results would change in case of continuous alphabets and why this assumption is made?\n\n2. Another major limitation is that, similar to some previous works, this work assumes that the FL algorithms used by the participating clients manage to find the \"global minimizer\" of the self-information weighted semi-empirical risk. This consequently means that the FL algorithm (considered for the participating clients), is \"equivalent\" to a centralized algorithm that has all training data of all participating clients in one place. In a sense, the paper assumes that there is no such thing as \"distributed learning\". While much of the work in the literature shows the different behavior of these architectures. In other words, it seems that the paper is not really about the federated learning setup. But rather the \"mismatch\" between test and training data.\n\n3. My main concern is that, unless I have missed something, it seems that all results are in terms of the \"information-theoretic-generalization gap\". However, except for some \"intuitions\", it has not been shown concretely what is the relation between such a definition and the true \"generalization error\". In other words, what are the concrete implications of these results for the true generalization error? If this relation cannot be established, I am not sure about the usefulness of the results.\n\n4. Considering Theorem 1, this result is obtained by almost purely algebraic manipulations (e.g., proofs of Lemmas 1 and 2) and excessive use of the triangle inequality. Besides the simplicity of the techniques used (except perhaps the proof of Lemma 3, which is inspired by and similar to previous work), the bounds using such techniques are susceptible to being very loose. Similar comments apply to Theorem 2. Therefore, considering the terms appearing in the bound as optimization proxies does not seem very justified.\n\n5. The authors mentioned that \u201cOur hypothesis is grounded in the notion that a model exhibiting proficiency with low-probability examples from training distributions might demonstrate adaptability to unfamiliar testing distributions.\u201d In a sense, intuitively, the goal here is to consider the \"worst case\" scenarios. However, it seems to me that the information-theoretic approach is not appropriate for this goal. In essence, information theory relies heavily on the probabilistic behavior of the learned model and data distribution, and the associated concentration of measures. Could the authors intuitively justify their information-theoretic approach and consider \"self-information-weighted expected risk\"?\n\n6. I think there are some mistakes in the definition of \"semi-empirical risk\" of Hu et al., 2023, just before section 3.2. In fact, they never considered \"self-information-weighted semi-empirical risk\" and in that paper $\\hat{h}^* = \\text{arg inf } \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{D}}$. Do authors change their definitions to conform to the new measure \"information-theoretic-generalization gap\"? If so, what is the relationship to what was originally defined there?\n\n7.  Describing the first term in the RHS of equation (4) as overfitting could be misleading. In fact, if, for example, $\\hat{h}^*$ is the minimizer of the self-information weighted expected risk for the set $\\mathcal{I}$, this term can still be large. What exactly is the intuition behind this term?\n\n8.  Remark 1 simply rewrites the RHS of equation (5). But could you please give some intuition about the behavior described and why it makes sense?"

Could the authors provide corresponding lower bounds for the proposed joint self-information-based generalization error bounds to show the tightness of the upper bounds? This paper could benefit tremendously from such insights and provide theoretical guarantees for the subsequent aggregation weighting and client selection strategies.\n\n2. In Definition 3, the information theoretic-generalization gap is based on the $\\hat{h}^*$, which is the optimal model parameter corresponding to the proposed self-information weighted expected risk. A similar notion of $\\hat{h}_t^*$ is used for the selected participating clients in Theorem 2. However, in practice, such optimal model parameters are rarely found due to the non-convexity of the problem. Instead, the model parameters in use are highly dependent on the problem setting (e.g., non-convexity, smoothness, etc.) and the optimization methods (e.g., a large number of FedAvg-type variants) and the associated hyper-parameters (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, etc.). Thus, the generalization error bounds derived in Theorems 1 and 2 based on the optimal parameters might not be very meaningful. Could the authors further characterize generalization error bounds for commonly used FL algorithms (e.g., FedAvg-type)?\n\n3. The numerical experiments in this paper are largely based on CNN EMNIST-10 and CIFAR-10, which are considered relatively simple in the literature.
