For entities, the entity candidates and their number for each relation type are detected using two types of question-answering framework, and the entities are extracted by filtering the entity candidates considering the number of entities. The approach shows the best performance among compared methods for the named entity recognition and relation extraction tasks on three biomedical data sets in the full data and low resource settings, except for relation extraction on one data set in the full data set setting. Ablation studies show the usefulness of the structure constraints and number prediction."
