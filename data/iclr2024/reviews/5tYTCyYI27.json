The y-axis in Figures G and H should be calibrated ECE instead of plain ECE, right?\n2. Despite extensive experiments analyzing why previous regularization-based methods have poorer calibratability, the paper fails to draw definitive conclusions. The various analyses only show correlation, not causation, between network depth and post-calibration ECE. Specifically, we can see depth is correlated with post-calibration ECE, but cannot conclude depth causes poorer post-calibration ECE. This is an issue with the motivation for the proposed method.\n3. While the experimental analysis is thorough, the paper lacks theoretical analysis and guidance to lead to clear conclusions about factors influencing model calibratability.\n4. The paper lacks formal definitions for key concepts like calibratability.\n5. The performance of the proposed method is poor. In most cases, it does not even outperform plain training. When combined with plain training, it can even hurt ECE (the authors relegate this result to the appendix rather than the main text)."

Building upon prior research, the authors found that common normalization techniques aimed at enhancing accuracy while penalizing overconfidence, i.e., weight decay, mixup, distillation, label smoothing, indeed hurts the final calibration (measured by ECE) when combined with temperature scaling (a post-hoc calibration method).\n\nTo study the problem, the authors analyzed the calibration performance of features from each layer using linear probing. They observed that for the initial layers, the calibration improves as training progressed. In contrast, the latter layers exhibited an increasing calibration error. The authors used the information bottleneck principle to interpret this phenomenon, suggesting that the initial layers of the model is fitting the training distribution, while the subsequent layers progressively compress model information to enhance the separability between classes. This compression process might compromise the model's calibratability (losing uncertainty information?).\n\nBased on these observations, the authors proposed the 'weak classifier' hypothesis, which advocates for not overtraining the model's compression capability and not losing excessive information to preserve its favorable calibration performance, while still retaining methods like weight decay to maintain its accuracy. The implementation of this weak classifier involves gradually freezing the latter layers to ensure that the initial layers receive the most training, and the final layers receive the least."

                "value": "Problem Definition & Empirical findings: \n1. Defining calibratability as \"how amenable a model is to be recalibrated in the post-training phase\" seems a bit inappropriate? For instance, in figure 1a, after training using the student distillation method, the ECE error is significant. However, after applying temperature scaling, there's a considerable error reduction. From this perspective, it seems the model is calibratable. But because its performance after adding TS remains inferior to standard training + TS, the model appears less calibratable. I think the description of calibratability should be related to the final calibration performance after combining with a post-hoc calibration method?\n2. It's interesting that figure 1 g/h have different tendencies. Do you have any intuition  why different dataset have different tendency for ECE dynamics? \n3. Regarding that this compression process might compromise the model's calibratability\", is it because the model, during the process of pushing each sample towards the class center, loses the uncertainty information of each sample in terms of their confidence?\n4. Regarding post-hoc calibration methods, it seems you've only compared scaling-based methods. What about binning-based methods or kernel-density-estimation-based post-hoc calibration methods? Will they display similar behavior, and if this phenomenon also holds true with other methods? It's fine if there isn't time to do the experiments, I just feel it would be more solid to involve them. \n5. I wonder if the reconstruction error is related to the dimension of the feature embedding of each layer. That is, if the feature embedding dimension begins to decrease e.g. from 4096 to 2048, will the model begin the compress their information? Or even the layer dimension remains 4096, it is still doing compression? I wonder whether we can infer from the dimension that at which layer the inflection point might occur? The thought behind this question is that to gain the best accuracy, whether the model will try to keep all the related information, even those unnecessary?\n\n**Experimental section:**\n1. Can the average ranking be calculated separately based on different metrics? It would make it easier to compare performance improvements on ECE and accuracy. Also, can the ranking variance be provided?\n2. It might be better if there is standalone performances of the method without combining with temperature scaling? Without temperature scaling, does this method show improvement compared to other training-based calibration algorithms? It's fine if there's no improvement since the ultimate goal of this paper is calibratability. But if there's an improvement, it indicates the method is still of some value when there is no validation set for post-hoc calibration (it is true that we can also leave a validation set for post-hoc calibration, but it also involves trade-off between the gain from validation set and the gain integrating the validation set into training).\n3. PLT still uses weight decay. Given the previous findings indicating that weight decay is quite sensitive in enhancing calibratability, how was the hyperparameter for weight decay chosen? Are hyperparameter selections needed?\n4. In Table 2, it would be better to clearly indicate that these are the performances combined with temperature scaling.\n5. The caption for Table 4 mentions different models (Table 4: The comparative results on Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18 (top) and ResNet-50 (bottom)), but the references seem to differentiate between training from scratch and fine-tuning. It seems inconsistent.\n6. Some typos: figure 1 (h): there is a \"!\". Page 7 \"Weight decay for frozen layers\" line 2: there are two \"same\"."

However, this is no evidence to support this point. For example, a post-hoc calibration method that changes the temperature of softmax can change calibration ability without any information compression. \n\n- The explanation of experimental results doesn't align with the experiment itself. For example, in table 1 (weight decay = 1e-3), top layer (index 17) improves validation accuracy from 71.5 to 75.9. That is NOT a *\"limited accuracy gain\"*.

This paper claims that **applying weight decay to frozen layers is one key to the success of the proposed method** (in section 3.2).
