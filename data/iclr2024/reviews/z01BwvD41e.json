The authors propose an evaluation framework inspired by language games like \"Who is Spy\" and \"SpyFall,\" involving a word guessing game . They introduce SpyGPT to evaluate LLMs' descriptive and disguising abilities and SpyGame, an interactive multi-agent board game to assess their linguistic skills and strategic thinking. Experiments with this framework demonstrate its effectiveness in evaluating LLMs' adaptability and strategic communication capabilities in complex scenarios."

The authors convert the board game to a multi-agent LLM setup, where all agents are motivated to apply reasoning before voting who the spy is. Specifically, given a target word and a distracting word, the host agents are prompted to identify the guest agent, and the guest agent is prompted to hide and misguide other agents through strategies such as interpreting other agents' roles. Results show that GPT-4 achieves the best performance. Furthremore, the authors identify and ablate three bias issues including name, speaking order, and option order."

What is more challenging about this environment is that in order to win the game, an agent needs to interpret other agents' reasoning, i.e., Second-Order Theory Of Mind. This can be a good benchmark for LLM evaluations, especially for reasoning and multi-agent.\n3. The paper is generally well written."

Most importantly, given that prompting is critical to the evaluation in this paper, there is no detail in terms of what prompts are actually used, and if few-shot examples are applied to evaluate either the SpyGame or SpyGPT (Also I suggest using a different name because my understanding is that you did not train a GPT model specially for the SpyGame).\n2. Similar, there is no information in terms of what \"40 target words\" are used, and how \"a sequence of dots\" are used to remove bias in the model. For the bias part, there is no detail regarding how many games are sampled to show how sever the bias problem is.\n3. Rather than changing orders to remove bias, it seems that a better solution is to use random tokens (rather than \"player 1\"), which does not require shuffling, and may not lead to any of the bias problem studied."
