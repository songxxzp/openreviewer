Instead of using the worst possible model to mitigate the issue in the existing literature, they adopt the idea of randomization of a certain model by introducing a prior probability distribution P over the set of possible models. They then\nconsider the application of the so-called entropic risk measure, as a quantification of robustness for counterfactuals, to hedge against the model\u2019s uncertainty based on their probability of occurrence.\n\nDue to the extreme value property of the entropic risk measure (with respect to the risk aversion parameter \u03b8), they build the connection between their model and the existing worst-case robust model, i.e., model (P2), where the latter can be seen as the limit case of the former when \u03b8 \u00d1 8. When the prior probability distribution of model uncertainty P is unknown or complex, they propose to use the sampling of the input data around the counterfactual to estimate the entropic risk measure of the model uncertainty. Under some condition that the MGFs of the model uncertainty at the counterfactuals and the output of the original model at points chosen randomly around the counterfactuals are sufficiently close, they derive the so-called \u201cfinite sample guarantee\u201d of the estimation of\nentropic risk measure for the model uncertainty.

However, its significance remains unclear to me.\n- The probabilistic guarantees in Theorem 2 are based on the assumption of Lipschitz continuity, and it might limit the application of this paper.\n- Regarding Theorem 2, we want $k$ to be large to keep a high probability bound. Then, how do you choose the number of samples $k$ in practice?\n- The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to ROAR in the HELOC dataset.
