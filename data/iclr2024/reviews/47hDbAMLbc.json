In its first result, it shows that it is NP-hard to compute a robust memorization of the simple network of depth 2 and width 2. It then provides a necessary condition on the width, depth and number of parameters for the existence of robust memorization. It further constructed a neural network which is a robust memorization."

                "value": "1. The term \u201coptimal robust memorization\u201d is inappropriate, and might be misleading and over-claims the significance of the work. Note that robust memorization with radius $< \\lambda_D/2$ is not significantly different from that with radius $< \\lambda_D/4$, except it is a bit larger neighborhood. This is because $\\lambda_D$ is just the minimal distance, not necessarily the distance for every pair of data samples. Hence, even in the case of the so-called \u201coptimal\u201d $\\lambda_D/2$-robust memorization, there are still many regions that are not covered by the robust-neighborhoods, and it can be non-robust in those areas. Therefore, $\\lambda_D/2$-robust memorization does not really make much difference than the  $\\lambda_D/4$-robust memorization. (The word \u201coptimal\u201d only reflects it is the largest radius in the minimal separation based analysis, however, as I mentioned above, it is far from an optimal robust memorization). Therefore, I would consider the contribution of this paper is on enlarging the robust memorization region, which is limited.\n\n2. It seems to me that some results are not consistent. Proposition 4.7 part 2 already infers that depth 2 width 2 network is not a robust memorization. However, Theorem 4.1 claims that it is NP-hard. I hope the authors can clarify on this point. \n\n3. The discussion below Theorem 1.1 is not quite correct. It somehow avoided the case that the absence of memorization implies the absence of robust memorization. Hence, it is not totally \u201ccannot be deduced from each other\u201d."

Since it is NP-hard to decide whether there exists a small network which is a robust memorization of a given dataset with a robust budget, studying necessary conditions is very important. Two important results are given in the paper. Let n be the input dimension and N be the number of datapoints. First, under a reasonable setting, a network with width smaller than n can not be robust memorization for some dataset and robust budget. Furthermore, there exists a network with width $3n+1$ and depth $2N+1$, and $O(Nn)$ nonzero weights such that a robust memorization is achieved. However, in this case, the values of the parameters can go to infinity when the robust budget is increased. To address this case, the second important result of this paper utilizes a deeper network to guarantee a bounded Lipschitz constant of the network, provided that the underlying classification problems are binary. The depth in this case is increased by a factor of $log(n)$."

The background knowledge is well-organized, and the theoretical results are presented in a flow that is easy to follow and understand.\n\n- Significance: The family of ReLU networks is an important architecture and understanding the limitations of memorization is crucial.
