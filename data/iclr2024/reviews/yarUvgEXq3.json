                "value": "The authors target tail performance in recommendation systems- a crucial but often overlooked scenario in the recommendation domain. They propose a collaborative filtering-based training approach for minimizing the conditional value at risk (CVaR), which represents the average risk for tail users. This is in contrast to conventional ERM-based methods, which focus on the overall average performance. The authors first show that a reformulation of the ERM objective using matrix factorization includes a non-smooth and non-linear term, which hampers the objective\u2019s separability, making it difficult to parallelize and scale the approach. The authors circumvent this issue by applying convolution-type smoothing in the objective. They then use convolution-type smoothed quantile estimation in their proposed method, \u201cSmoothing Approach for Efficient Risk-averse Recommender (SAFER2). They evaluate their model in the semi-worst case and average-case scenarios and find that, in general, their approach improves tail performance while maintaining average case performance."

(in the manuscript.)\n- What if we just put some high weight on the tail users? or What if we just compute gradient only with bottom-$\\alpha$% losses?\n\n2. Experiment\n- The main experimental result focuses on that SAFER2 shows comparable results when $\\alpha=1$ and superior results when $\\alpha=0.3$.\n- When $\\alpha=1$, there are many recent methods outperforming Multi-VAE. e.g., LightGCN, SGCL. and in my opinion, the pair-wise and list-wise loss functions outperform the point-wise loss.\n- When $\\alpha=0.3$, there are many recent methods enhancing the performance of tail users.\n- Did you train two SAFER2 models with $\\alpha=1$ and $\\alpha=0.3$? If so, that is somewhat unfair for the baselines (e.g., VAE-CF).\n\n[Minor cencerns]\n1. Equation numbers are needed for each equation when finding the location of the equation by ordering."
