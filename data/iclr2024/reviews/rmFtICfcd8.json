This point as a contribution is too weak. \n\nAlthough the idea of introducing generalized KL divergence may be reasonable, the final objective is without much difference from the previous one. During the practical implementation of previous functional BNNs, we usually add a diagonal identify matrix to ensure the non-singular the covariance matrix in (2) or (11). Hence, the technique contribution is weak. In the experiments, there are no results to show the cases where the non-singular covariance matrix impacts greatly the results."

Other than this, I fail to see any contribution, and even the combination of those two methods is implemented quite straightforwardly, without any issue to consider during that process.\n- Limited experiments. While I appreciate the experiments on the regression tasks, they are relatively small-scale tasks, and only the small BNNs (MLPs mostly) are tested. It is hard to judge the effectiveness of the proposed method without scaling, for instance, the image classification task (CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100, at least) solved with ResNet, as typically done in the literature."

There is a class of inference algorithms (generalized Bayesian inference) generalizing the standard Bayesian inference procedure and thus variational inference by extending the likelihood or KL regularization term with more flexible functions, and for such cases the utility of the extended objective can be described in the perspective of generalizaton error. However, in the current form, the alternative objective with the regularized KL does not explain anything about its optimum. I think there should be some intuitive justification for this."
