The paper lacks a proper identifiability result. \nModeling assumptions and assumptions for identifiability are never properly stated. My understanding is that the paper assumes that identifiability for DeepIVA follows trivially from previous works (e.g., iVAE). \nThis is, in my view, unclear, or misleading, see Questions. \n\n(Note that, in principle, solid empirical work which does not prove identifiability results may nonetheless be relevant and worthwhile. \nHowever, identifiability is referred to multiple times in the paper, in a way which may be deceptive if compared to other works in the nonlinear ICA literature.) \n\n3. There is insufficient discussion of related literature on multi-view ICA, both linear and nonlinear, and its applications to neuroimaging, see Questions.\n\n4. In Fig. 5, the reported MCC of (a maximum of roughly) 0.7 seems rather low compared to results reported in other nonlinear ICA works for identifiable models.\n\n\n__________\n\n**Edit:** After discussion with the authors, I raised my evaluation to a 5."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The first question would be to explicitly write down the full generative model. If the work is intended to claim identifiability for this model, a Theorem proving under which assumptions said generative model is identifiable should be provided.\n\n2. In the manuscript, it sounds like identifiability should follow trivially from previous works, such as the iVAE framework (Khemakhem et al., 2020). Even if this were the case, it would be helpful to restate and discuss the required assumptions.\nMoreover, I find it hard to understand how to apply the results in (Khemakhem et al., 2020) in the context of this work. In particular, the results in (Khemakhem et al., 2020) lead to a specific kind of identification of the latent components, which is not up to permutation and element-wise nonlinear transformations: in fact, an additional linear indeterminacy remains (note also that the results refer to identifiability of sufficient statistics). It is unclear to me why the MISA network should be the right model to undo those transformations which may be unresolved in reconstructed components (with respect to the true ones), and to match components across datasets; and on what basis identifiability of the resulting two-step procedure would be guaranteed. \n\n2. What is the relationship of the model proposed in this paper with previous literature on multi-view ICA, both linear [1, 2, 3] and nonlinear [4]?\nMy understanding is that multi-view ICA models the dependence of (in this paper's notation) the components of $\\mathbf{s}_i$ differently---e.g., [1], eq. (1), in the linear case; or [4], eqs. (5-7) and Definition 2, in the nonlinear case. \nCrucially, in the nonlinear case [4], Def. 2 introduces a technical assumption which rules out trivial cases and constitutes one of the required \nassumptions for identifiability. I am confused by the lack of discussion of analogous assumptions in this work. Note also that multi-view nonlinear ICA [4] allows for identifiability in the absence of an additional auxiliary variable besides the collection of views, something the authors refer to in the Limitations section of the present paper.\n\n4. I found the description of the neuroimaging data lacking. Could you please describe the dataset used in the experiments, and relate them to the DeepIVA model? What aspect of the neuroimaging data used in the experiments is supposed to be modelled with a statistical dependence across datasets/subjects (i.e., among components of $\\mathbf{s}_i$)? \nMoreover, is it task-based neuroimaging data, or resting state? If task-based, how does the proposed method compare to [1, 2] or [5]? If not (resting state), how is the statistical dependence among components of the $\\mathbf{s}_i$ vector to be interpreted?\n\n5. How would you explain the results in Fig. 5? Why is the MCC so low?\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Richard, Hugo, et al. \"Modeling shared responses in neuroimaging studies through multiview ICA.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 19149-19162.\n\n[2] Richard, Hugo, et al. \"Shared independent component analysis for multi-subject neuroimaging.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 29962-29971.\n\n[3] Pandeva, Teodora, and Patrick Forr\u00e9. \"Multi-view independent component analysis with shared and individual sources.\" Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence.
