They identify two useful resources, CTF and fuzzing reported security flaws, which can potentially compensate for the diversity of the common strategy to focus on Github commits to extract vulnerable and benign code snippets. Also, the well-controlled CTF challenges have few label noises compared to samples collected from Github commits, since the changed function in a commit might not directly relate to the vulnerability while they are typically sampled and noisily labeled by existing benchmarks.\n+ This paper conducts extensive evaluation on 16 models with up to tens/hundreds of billions of parameters while existing works mostly evaluate smaller code LMs with at max hundreds of millions of parameters. The experiments tend to reveal a more up-to-date SOTA performance from the most capable LLMs, though even these latest models seem not to significantly outperform the smaller models and not promising enough in vulnerability detection."

                "value": "__The main contributions of VulBench are neither clearly specified nor sufficiently evaluated.__ As a datasets/benchmark paper, the most important contribution should be the additional value it brings, compared to the existing benchmarks of the same type. However, such contributions are not clear in this paper.\n\nFirst, though the paper identifies new resources to collect vulnerable samples, it is not clear how different and valuable these new resources and samples are, compared to the existing benchmarks. I would recommend the author illustrate the value of these samples, such as whether they cover unique CWEs that existing benchmarks do not have, or whether they compensate for specific types of low-resource vulnerabilities, etc. In addition, in Section 3.2.3, it is quite vague how VulBench cleans up Devign, D2A, and BigVul, and also not clear how accurate the labels are after their filtering. I would recommend the authors to concretize the effects of the cleaning and filtering, such as what was the ratio of noisy labels in the original benchmark and how does that improve with VulBench's version.\n\nSecond, the comparison between VulBench and existing benchmarks is missing. To illustrate the value of the new benchmark, the most effective way is to directly compare with the existing benchmarks to explain what are the difference. However, the evaluation of this paper focuses on comparing the CTF split and real-world split of its own benchmark and ignores to compare VulBench, as a whole, to Devign, D2A, and BigVul. I would suggest the authors to evaluate the 16 LLMs on these existing benchmarks as well and conduct a thorough analysis to reveal what perspectives could not be well studied by existing benchmarks, while VulBench's additional resources and sample filtering help, serving as a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation of LLMs' capacity in vulnerability detection than others.\n\n__The dataset contains many reversed decompiled code, questioning the naturalness and reality of these code samples.__ While I agree that the samples from CTF and MAGMA bring better diversity than focusing on Github commit, the decompiled code samples from these resources are concerning. The decompiled source code could be quite different from realistic programs written by human, and there could be instinct patterns or data structures that are hardcoded by the decompilation tool but rarely or never used by the developers. Though the authors mentioned that they try their best to make the decompiled samples look natural by variable renaming, etc, it is not clear how effective their decorations are to bring back the code naturalness. I would encourage the authors to quantify, beyond only case studies, how (un)natural these decompiled samples are compared to human-written code, and this is important to estimate the usefulness and reality of the benchmark to evaluate LLM's capability in vulnerability detection in the real-world scenario.\n\n\n__The main methodology of this paper, the dataset construction process, is rather brief and vague, missing details and illustrations for understanding.__ In general, Section 3.2, as the explanation of the main methodology is not understandable and lacks details. For 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, it is better to assume that audiences have no background in CTF problems and fuzzing, so more details should be explained (maybe in Appendix), such as what are the format of CTF problems and fuzzing reports, and how the labels are constructed accordingly. A few concrete examples from the raw data to the benchmark samples will be appreciated. This will not only increase the readability but also the reliability of the sample labels.\n\n__The benchmark is not available for review so far.__ Somehow I could not find the link to this benchmark. For this paper, the benchmark itself is the major output, and I might need to manually inspect the quality of tens of samples to determine the general quality of this work. Due to the brief and vague description of the approach, I would urge the authors to anonymously release the benchmark for reviewers to directly evaluate the quality. Of course, if I accidentally missed the link somewhere, please correct me."
