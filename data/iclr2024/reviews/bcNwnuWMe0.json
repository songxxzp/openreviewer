Although there are some experimental support to this, it is difficult to draw this conclusion because the authors have only tried a limited set of models. As the claim is counter-intuitive, more analysis, especially analysis of the raw data, is required for supporting the claim. Are there correlations between the water level in two gauge stations upstream and downstream? And are there time lags between between a spike in an upstream gauge station and a downstream gauge station? If so, the spike in the upstream gauge station should be useful for predicting the spike in the downstream gauge station. Why is this not reflected in the experiment results? \n\n- I have reservations about the way the problem is modeled. Since we are interested in predicting flood, which is a rare event, fitting the average MSE loss to the time series data might not be the best approach. Assuming the floods are rare large spikes in the data, a conservative model will do best by trying NOT to predict a large spike, as getting the timing of the spike wrong can incur a huge MSE loss. It could, for example, be modeled alternatively as a time series prediction problem, where we try to predict if there is a flood event within the next 6 hours given the water level in the past 24 hours. There could be multiple ways to model this but MSE on the water level does not seem the right fit for modeling rare spike events."

                "value": "- How long does it take on average for the flow from one upstream gauge station to reach a neighboring downstream gauge station? I think these values should be taken into account for the history window size (24 hours currently) and the prediction horizon (6 hours currently). \n\n- What is the sample size for each gauge station? Or more importantly, what is the average number of flood events that each gauge station experience in the data? If the sample size is small, it could be beneficial to just pool all the data and train one model for the time series prediction of rare events, than to spread the rare event samples across multiple stations and try to model their correlations. Could that be a reason why the incorporation of network structure is not helping here? \n\n- The authors claim that the methods perform similarly. From Table 2 it seems to be true for NSE, but MSE has a lot more variations across the different methods. Why is this the case?"

Specifically, the authors splitter 18 years of data into 6 folds of 3 years of data and conducted cross-validation. I found it hard to be convinced of any conclusion derived from such setup. For example, in one of the 6 runs where training data happen to include data in 2014 and the prediction data happens to include data in 2013 - in that case, a model trained with future information is used to predict the past - unless there is no auto-correlation at all, otherwise, such future leakage will undermine the conclusion made from such numerical results. With such concern, it may not necessary be that topology information does not contribute to forecasting future river discharge, but rather, since the model has already known about the past and the future about the river discharge, such topology information may not add any information any more. In practical settings where only historical information is known, having such topology information could still yield accuracy gain - well this is just a hypothesis assuming the experiment is properly set up such that no future information is leaked."

Instead of evaluating an entire period of record, flood forecasting models typically identify individual events within the historical flow record using an approach such as peak over threshold.\n\nGiven the negative results, additional attempts should be made to identify and demonstrate how/why the model is failing.

Were flood peaks predicted with errors in timing or magnitude, or did the model fail to predict them at all?\n\nIs it reasonable to perform element-wise normalization for a graph where the value of nodes relative to adjacent nodes is important?
