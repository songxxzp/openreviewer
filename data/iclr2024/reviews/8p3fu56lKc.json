The main concern is the significance to the community. \n\n**Practical Insight**: It is still a major concern. I am not clear on what I can learn from this paper. It makes the result less interesting and significant to me. For example, can this paper provide an explanation for any phenomenon in in-context learning in practice? How can this paper guide the training in practice?\n\n**Experiments**: Generally, I am satisfied with the efforts of the authors. Since I only specified one experiment, I will not treat the experiment part as a big weakness, although I expect to see more experiments. \n\n**Fully connected neural networks and Assumption 1**: Good, I am satisfied with this result.\n\n**Contribution compared to [Zhang, et al. 2023]**: OK. Although [Zhang et al., 2023] was posted online 3.5 months before ICLR submission deadline, I agree it can be treated as a concurrent work."

                "value": "In this paper, the authors provide a theoretical analysis of transformers equipped with a single layer of linear self-attention, trained on synthetic noisy linear regression data. The primary focus of this paper lies in exploring in-context learning pretraining scenarios, where the training data consists of pairs (x_i, y_i) with associated ground truth, and the evaluation is based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric for the test point (x', y').\n\nThe key findings presented in this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) Under the assumption of linear noisy ground truth, when x_i samples are drawn from an isotropic Gaussian distribution, the one-layer transformer model that minimizes the pretraining loss effectively corresponds to a single step of Gradient Descent (GD) applied to the least-squares linear regression problem. (2) When x_i samples are drawn from a non-isotropic Gaussian distribution, the optimization process becomes a preconditioned GD. The authors shed light on this aspect, showcasing the connection between the nature of the input distribution and the optimization approach. Furthermore, The paper goes beyond linear cases, demonstrating that the findings can be extended to non-linear scenarios under specific symmetric conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly recommend accepting this paper for the following reasons: (1) The paper demonstrates exceptional organization, making it highly accessible and comprehensible for the readers. (2) The topic addressed in this paper holds paramount significance within the Language Model (LLM) domain, contributing to our understanding of key theoretical aspects. (3) The paper introduces some innovative results, particularly in the sections related to preconditioning and non-linear extensions. These novel findings are likely to ignite further research and inspire intriguing follow-up studies."
