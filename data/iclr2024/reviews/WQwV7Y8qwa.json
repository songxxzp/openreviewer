The inference algorithm uses the forward-backward algorithm to learn the latent state, and a transformer encoder as the variational distribution to infer the continuous latent. Experiments show that the proposed MR-SDS is able to learn the model parameter and then infer the nonlinear latent and predict future data. Besides, the volume of messages passing between different regions can be understood by such a model."

Briefly, the multi-region switching NLDS architecture assumes multiple, switching nonlinear latent dynamical systems per region, governed by a discrete state variable and continuous latent dynamics, whose transitions are all functions of the system input and previous states parameterized by neural nets. The emission model is likewise parameterized by an NN, while the latent state inference is performed by a Transformer that pools across regions (after local embeddings). Training is done via maximizing ELBO. The authors apply their method to 3 simulated systems, finding good performance compared to ground-truth latents and interpretable flow fields and inter-areal messages. Furthermore, the proposed method is benchmarked against a variety of previous single/multi-region switching/non-switching (non-)linear methods on two real datasets, with best performance on the co-smoothing metric. Lastly, they demonstrate how the method can be used to gain dataset-specific neuroscientific insights."

However, the flexibility comes with a series of issues, most prominently the choice of hyperparameter values, such as the dimensionality of the system and, critically, the number of switching states. In the simulation experiments, if I understand correctly, the model was given the ground-truth number of states, but how would the inferred systems look like when starting with a different number (e.g., for the switching Lotka-Volterra system)? This is further an issue with the real neural data, where one does not have access to the ground-truth, and it\u2019s arguable whether there is such a number.\n\nSecond, is that the applications to real data is somewhat unconvincing for me, both in terms of the assumptions one makes regarding model architecture and hyperparameter values (related to above) and what actual insight was gained. Given the technical contribution in the method, I don\u2019t think the authors should necessarily be penalized for attempting to apply it on real data. Nevertheless, I feel that the main claims regarding neuroscientific insight was not sufficiently evidenced.\n\nTherefore, my recommendation is borderline reject, and I would be willing to update my score if the authors can conduct a few robustness experiments, as well as argue why some of the hyperparam decisions and model assumptions are not problematic in a neuroscience setting, and/or are acknowledged as limitations."

                "value": "- a major question is whether the existing results are robust to different choices of the number of switching states, latent dims, etc., especially in the simulation experiments but using an incorrect number, as well as how do results change when applied to experimental data. I leave up to the authors to decide how best to demonstrate this, but in general, for a practicing neuroscientist using such a method, I would expect somewhat robust/consistent results independent of hyperparam choices.\n- The inferred systems from the real data (Figures 3 & 4) don\u2019t look that great, and I\u2019m generally not sure what I\u2019m suppose to get from them in general. First, in Figure 3B, the flow fields in state all look like linear 1D flows. Is this meaningful? Could this not have been combined with the first state? Or what happens if one uses a larger number of states, are all the ones after state 1 simple linear-ish flows? And how would one interpret this either way?\n- In general, the figures could use a bit more explanation, e.g., what are the main occupied states? Why is the same trajectory plotted in both states but different portions are highlighted in blue in 3B? How exactly should someone interpret 3C / 4D? Various plots don\u2019t have labeled axes (e.g., 3D, 4B/C), I guess that\u2019s time in ms?\n- one assumption the model makes is that communication across regions are in the form of the latent variable, while in the brain this happens concretely and literally via spikes, which is more akin to the observed signal in this model (though here it\u2019s calcium signals). How is the original assumption valid given this?\n- in practice, how does one decide on the various hyperparameter values, such as the number of latent dimensions, switching states, etc.?\n- Some more discussion regarding whether there is an advantage to using multiple discrete nonlinear DS instead of one bigger / flexible one is warranted. In particular, is the switching timescale realistic considering neurobiology, and what would the switching states represent?\n- I\u2019m not sure what to make of the comparison to PCA in the high-D RNN experiment: the inferred flow field look quite similar, and if anything the PCA one looks cleaner. Maybe some further expansion on what we should be looking for would be helpful? (Also what are the markers?)\n- some small typos and such: page 6 line 2, \u201cFigure 2a\u201d should be 2c; line directly above figure 2 is a runaway latex comment; page 8 section 4.6 \u201cFigure 5 shows a macro\u2026\u201d should be Figure 3; Supplemental text refers to Figure AX while the numbers continue from the main figures; Figure 3D missing caption label, and what is the dark brown suppose to be? Fixing these (and the figure issues above) would lift the overall quality of the paper."

The proposed method models low dimensional nonlinear neural dynamics. With transformer encoders inferring the states, the model provides a more precise representation compared to existing models such as rSLDS and RNNs. The model is validated by three simulations and is applied to two multi-region neural datasets."

                "value": "1. The authors state that RNNs have higher dimensionality while solving such problems, and thus, it is difficult to interpret the inferred dynamics. However, MR-SDS has a transformer included which may be even more difficult to interpret. Indeed, while the authors show a higher accuracy, they do not show the interpretability at all; it is not clear how interpretable this model is, more so since the communication between different brain regions cannot be accurately recovered (e.g., Fig. 2D).\n2. In Figure 2, what is rho? Additionally, the reconstruction of states and the reconstruction of states\u2019 communication are actually not good, thus, it is hard to say the model reconstructs the latent states successfully.\n3. Could the authors detail the parameters, such as alpha, beta, and so on, in section 4.1.\n4. In section 4.3, it would be better to link the paragraph to the figure with the corresponding result, referring to which figure the authors are talking about. Additionally, I assume that the figure is Figure 6, but how do the authors find that MR-SDS embeds a richer representation than PCA? And why is a richer representation better here? Since the resulting PCs are orthogonal, it is unfair to compare them with the richness of the data representation. \n\nMoreover, clarity is not as high as it should be. The authors would need to proofread the submission carefully and generate the figures professionally. Here are some examples that may need to be revised:\nSection 4.1, last sentence: \u201cMAKE SURE to say here that we also include in appendix A1 a result without the external input and show that we can still do inference but can\u2019t generate\u201d is not appropriate to show here.\nFigure 2B needs a legend."
