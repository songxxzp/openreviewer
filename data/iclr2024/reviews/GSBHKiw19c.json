It seems like the offline data set is fixed according to Algorithm 1, thus you can treat the dynamics models $P_t$ as the generative models while the dynamics rewards $D_t$ as the discriminators.\n- Proposition 1 is a result for tabular setting. Furthermore, this discriminator only differentiates properly the in-distribution transitions---how does this discriminator enable OOD generalization?\n\t- On page 27, last paragraph indicates that in the halfcheetah task, the dynamics reward appears to be less robust on OOD samples---is this not contradictory to what the main paper claims? Perhaps this has to do with the coverage of the data set---it appears that both `halfcheetah-medium-expert` and `halfcheetah-medium` are visibly suffering in OOD generalization, but they have less coverage on the state-action space compared to `random` and `replay`.\n- The rate is $1/\\sqrt{T}$, so how big should $T$ really be in practice? Proposition 1 somewhat suggests that $T$ should be almost covering the whole state-action space---seems like in that case we can just directly model the dynamics using a table?\n\t- Experimentally, does this correspond to 5000 as suggested by Table 4 in the appendix?\n- In experimental analysis, it appears the paper focuses mainly on locomotion tasks, and they seem to be mostly overlaps (i.e. NeoRL and D4RL share very similar environments.) I am curious if this applies to other non-trivial environments that are supported by D4RL."

This is especially pronounced in offline model-based RL, where there is no online data to correct model errors. Prior offline MBRL methods typically address this by discouraging the policy from visiting states where the model is uncertain, via some uncertainty quantification. This paper introduces a novel perspective: they learn a \"dynamics reward\" that evaluates the dynamics consistency of transitions and use it to filter model rollouts to only produce trajectories that are plausible under the dynamics. Concretely, they train the dynamics reward model using inverse max margin IRL. Rollout filtering is performed in a beam-search fashion, where at each rollout step they sample a number of transitions from the model and weight them by their dynamics rewards. Applying this method on top of existing offline MBRL methods results in significant improvements over prior state-of-the-art on D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks. Overall, this paper makes a solid contribution to offline model-based RL by introducing a novel perspective for tackling compounding error and distribution shift."

Can you evaluate the dynamics model explicitly on OOD (s, a) pairs and see if the dynamics reward is still higher with valid transitions? \n- How does this method compare to a simple filtering technique like selecting the transition with the lowest bellman error?\n- When filtering, why construct a softmax distribution instead of directly taking the argmax action?\n- How does the reward dynamics relate to energy-based models? It seems quite similar to an energy function on (s, a, s').\n\nSuggestions:\n- Table 1 could use a more detailed caption.\n- It would be nice to use this for model-based offline policy evaluation [1]. I would imagine the reduction in compounding error to benefit OPE a lot.\n\nReferences:\n1. Michael R. Zhang, Tom Le Paine, Ofir Nachum, Cosmin Paduraru, George Tucker, Ziyu Wang, Mohammad Norouzi.
