The last equation on Page 4 has a strong assumption that all the clean examples are centered around the mean of them. Namely, the method assumes that the distances from all the clean examples to the example center are the same. The examples marked as yellow in Figure 1 are distributed like a circle. However, the real-world data distribution often deviates from the assumption. The distribution could be elliptical-like. In this case, the obtained v is not optimal anymore.\n\n3. In the third row of Table 2, DRR achieves a better trade-off. Why it demonstrates a higher accuracy (ACC) instead of a lower ASR?\n\n4.
