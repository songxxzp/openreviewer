                "value": "**Unclear presentation and unjustified claims**\n\nBefore delving into the other concerns, the presentation lacks clarity and is missing essential information.\n\n- In Sec. 1 - paragraph 3, the paper categorizes OWSSL methods into \"BCE-based\" and \"Other\" methods. Why is the use of BCE loss a meaningful categorization?\n- In Sec. 1 - paragraph 4, the paper claims that using MSE instead of BCE lacks \"flexibility.\" What is the definition of flexibility in this context, and why is BCE considered better than MSE for this purpose?\n- In Sec. 1 - paragraph 5, the paper suddenly discusses \"seen-unseen pairs.\" Why is this concept important, and how is it related to the problem? This relationship is not explained.\n- In Sec. 2 - paragraph 2, the paper claims that previous works do not consider optimization at the feature level. However, they also jointly optimize the feature and classifier.\n- In Sec. 2 - paragraph 3, the paper claims that OpenCon is incapable of sustaining \"continuous optimization\" of representations. What is continuous optimization, and why can't OpenCon achieve this?\n- In Sec. 3.2, why should one consider BCE-based methods? BCE-based methods are just one specific approach by Cao et al. and some follow-ups. Eq. (1) does not represent all OWSSL methods.\n- ...but not limited to.\n\nAside from the unclear overall logic, the sentences are significantly unpolished. Many grammatical errors make it difficult to grasp the meaning.\nThere are also typos and inconsistent use of terminologies. For example, \"L\" in the abstract, uncapitalized \"all\" in Table 1, unformatted \"seen/unseen\" in Sec. 3.1, and \"OWSSL\" is not defined in Sec. 3.2.\n\n\n---\n**Proposed method is merely a combination of existing techniques**\n\n\nThe motivation if the method is (1) enhance the separability of known class features and (2) prevent the collapse of unknown class features.\nThe paper employs SupCon (and a NN variant) for (1) and SelfCon for (2).\n\nThere are two issues here:\n1. It is obvious that contrastive learning would enhance performance. In fact, this benefit for OWSSL has already been demonstrated in prior works, such as GCD [1] and OpenCon [2].\n2. The addition of Sup/SelfCon generally enhances the models, not only for the OWSSL problem. To verify this, one can apply the proposed method to (1) the standard SSL setup and (2) other SSL methods. I believe it will also result in improvements in those cases, suggesting that the method does not exclusively target the OWSSL issue.\n\n---\n**Missing important baselines**\n\nThe paper omits a comparison with a highly related work, OpenCon [2]. The reasons provided in the paper for avoiding this comparison are not convincing. Additionally, GCD [1] is highly relevant to the paper but is missing from the comparison.\nFurthermore, the paper does not include a comparison with papers published in 2023, such as RoPAWS [3], which also employs contrastive learning for SSL. Not only them, but there is also a long list of related works.\nThe OpenCon paper has 6 pages of references, in contrast to this paper with only 2 pages. Checking them would enable a more comprehensive context in the related work section, thereby making the paper more self-contained.\n\n[1] Generalized Category Discovery, CVPR'22.\\\n[2] OpenCon: Open-world Contrastive Learning.

In addition, the paper focuses on performing SSL on the feature-level representations, where the author provides theoretical analysis to argue the superiority of contrastive loss over conventional BCE loss.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The main weakness of the paper lies in the narration of the paper, which makes it hard for a broader audience to capture the contributions of the paper. In many parts of the paper, the writing is focused on *what* is done but not *why* this is better than alternative methods. This makes the paper seem like a technical report rather than a research paper. A good paper is expected to provide insights to other researchers on 'why' the method works and how it can help with future research and real-world applications. This issue is particularly concerning in the introduction section, which is supposed to provide readers with high-level motivation of the methods. However, in the introduction, the third paragraph lists BCE-based methods and non-BCE methods without discussing when each of the methods is preferred and why each is motivated. Though the fourth paragraph attempts to argue for the superiority of BCE-based methods for open-world SSL, it again does not talk about high-level motivation for BCE-based methods. Instead, it directly dives into the details of similarity functions and talks about 'pulling closer sample pairs'. Such a discussion misses out a lot of context and causes confusion on what are the actual contribution of the paper. Also, the highlighted question in the introduction section seems to overlap greatly with the contribution with OpenCon. The only difference is that the authors claim CONTROl is 'unified' and 'open-world', but there is no further analysis on these two factors and how CONTROL differentiates itself from OpenCon.\n- The paper seems to miss out on the addition of CONTROL to an important baseline OpenCon. OpenCon also proposes to apply contrastive learning for SSL. The paper argues that OpenCon is 'incapable of sustaining continuous optimization of representations during the process of semi-supervised learning'. However, from the final table 1 and table 2, the performance of OpenCon is pretty close to NACH+CONTROL, which somewhat undermines the claim of the novelty and contributions of CONTROL. A more convincing experiment would be to extend OpenCon with techniques proposed in this paper."

This can be regarded as a revision of the introduction section but can be brief just for discussion now.\n- **A small-scale additional experiment.** It would greatly enhance the claim of contributions in this paper if the author could provide a small-scale experiment on a dataset where CONTROl is combined with OpenCon."
