                "value": "\\paragraph{Comparison of encoding efficiency to other methods/experiments}\nThe authors don't make considerable efforts to compare their work to previous ones relating to sequence encoding.\nThere are many works on sequence learning, see for example (Lipton, 2015). Your work is a particular subclass of networks that can perform sequence-to-sequence processing (namely where you have a sequence with an single input and the start and zero inputs afterwards). Make comparison with other methods to measure the performance of your framework in terms of robustness to noise, memory capacity (number of recallable pattern sequences), etc.\n\n\\paragraph{Other experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method}\nThe the demonstration contribution of this framework could benefit from some additional experiments.\nExperiments for effect of noise level of the first patter on the performance.\nFurther, the paper doesn't address how inputs to the network influence the output or performance. Experiments that track performance of the networks as a function of injected noise during sequence generation would better demonstrate the usefulness of this framework for neuroscience.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Figures}\nOverall, the information in the figures is very low.\nFor Figure 4 and 11 for example it is unclear what is to be gained from seeing the convergence of the algorithm, if it is not compared to other algorithms to see which converges in less epochs for example.\n\nFor Figure 7 and 8 it would be beneficial to see how increasing $T$ influences retrieval success as $M$ and $N$ are changed.\n\n\\paragraph{Some remarks on concepts and notation}\nThe section on the robustness hyperparameter is unclear. Better describe how the margin of the margin perceptron is related to the robustness here.\n\nRelating to the derivations:Why does such a $U^\\star$ exist?\nAfter Equation (19): \"due to (1)\". Should this be \"due to (17)\"?\n\nThere are a couple of unintroduced variables/notation.\nIn Eq. (33) $q$ is appearing without introduction. Should this be $p$? Clarify step (32) to (33) in the derivation.\nIn Eq. (39) $\\Omega$ has not been introduced. Did you mean $O$?\n\n\n\\paragraph{Neuroscience implications}\nThe justification of the relevance of this work to V1 neurons is insufficient.\nThe authors should justify why this particular activation function is a good model for V1 neural activity. Furthermore, the claim about unexplained V1 neural activity relies on the limit of the Heaviside activation function, for other activation functions hidden neurons would not be necessary.\nBut more fundamentally, the authors seem to understand V1 neural activity dynamics in a very different way than the general con census. Although there is sufficient recurrence in V1, the main function of these neurons is not sequence generation. Hippocampal circuits (that are mentioned in the beginning of the paper) would be a better justification.\nFinally, for V1 neurons in particular, but for all subnetworks in the brain really, inputs are a very important contribution to the dynamics.\n\n\nLipton, Z.C., Berkowitz, J. and Elkan, C., 2015.
