I would prefer also some motivating discussion on the choice of dealing with the action delays. Personally, I would find more natural if the action delays would not be limited to discrete values, and being executed after the delay (in many physical systems, the evolution of the system is not restricted to discrete steps anyway, even if the decision are). This would avoid the drop and duplication of the actions. Also, we might not necessarily observe the realization of execution delay, unless we can reverse engineer it from a known transition model (when it is deterministic). \n\nI can see arguments for the considered variant as well. Since the `proper' way to incorporate stochastic action delays in the MDP is not well established, I would like to see some (more) motivating discussion on the choice, and not only how it is handled. \n\nWhile MuZero and (somewhat to lesser extent) EfficientZero are well known, it is still difficult to understand the new algorithm described only in terms of differences to EfficientZero. The algorithm should be described completely, while pointing out the relevant differences.\n\nThe experiments are fairly extensive, but there is the issue of lack of clear baselines when a new problem is proposed. Maybe adapting the Delay-Correcting Actor-Critic of Bouteiller (even if does not have an MCTS module)?\n\nMinor: the initial state distribution (\\mu) in the MDP tuple is not present in the SED-MDP definition. Is this an intentional omission? \n\nOverall, I feel that there is a valuable contribution in the paper, but the presentation issues are fairly significant, and make the evaluation of the contribution difficult."

The proposed method is able to accurately infer future states from the action queue, and thus handles delayed execution while preserving the sample efficiency of EfficientZero.\n\nThe authors establish the insight of optimizing within the set of Markov policies offers a more efficient and scalable solution compared to history-dependent policies. They introduce a model-based algorithm, namely, Delayed EfficientZero, that builds upon EfficientZero. The proposed algorithm yields non-stationary Markov policies, maintaining efficiency and scalability without making assumptions about the delay distribution.\n\nDelayed feedback analysis is a rising topic in RL.
