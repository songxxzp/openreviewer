The main novelty of this work is using the \"exponential general Gaussian\" (EGG) distribution as $Q$, which compared to standard Gaussian changes the exponent from 2 to $\\eta$. The authors claim that this can further improve the certified radius of DSRS."

(2022); (b) there are fundamental errors in the theoretical analysis as well as the experiments. \n\n## (a) Comparing to Li et al. (2022)\nCompared to Li et al. published in ICML 2022, the only novelty of this submission seems to be the EGG distribution and related theoretical analysis and empirical verification. The theoretical part, however, is almost the same as Li et al. (2022). Specifically, Theorem 1 focuses on the case where $\\eta = 2$, and this statement is the exact same statement as Theorem 2 in Li et al. (2022). Note that the EGG distribution with $\\eta = 2$ is equivalent to the generalized Gaussian distribution used in Table 1 of Li et al. (2022). Although this submission does cite Li et al. (2022), its writing seems to claim that Theorem 1 is a novel result, which is definitely false. In fact, the proof of Theorem 1 is essentially the same as Li et al. (2022), Theorem 2:\n- Lemma C.1/C.2 (this work) = Proposition F.1 (Li et al.). The only difference is $\\eta$, which in my opinion adds almost no additional difficulty to the proof. \n- Lemma C.3 (this work) = Lemma F.2 (Li et al.). Only difference is $\\eta$.\n- Lemma C.4 (this work) = Lemma F.3 (Li et al.). Only difference is $\\eta$.\n- And so on.\n\nMoreover, Section 4.3 is almost the same as Section 5 in Li et al. (2022), except for $\\eta$.\n\nOverall, I don't see any significant difference between this submission before Section 5 and Li et al. (2022), except for $\\eta$. The proofs and the algorithms are all essentially the same.\n\n## (b) Does $\\eta$ really work? No.\nI have pointed out that the only novelty of this submission is $\\eta$, so does $\\eta$ really break the curse of dimensionality as the authors claim? I don't think so, and I think that there are two fundamental errors:\n\nTheoretically, in Theorem 4 the authors proved an $\\Omega(d^{1/\\eta})$ lower bound of the certified radius, and claim that this bound gets larger as $\\eta$ gets smaller. The problem is that when $\\eta$ becomes smaller, then the premise of this result also becomes stronger. Specifically, with the same $\\sigma$ and $p$, the $(\\sigma, p, \\eta)$-concentration assumption is stronger as $\\eta$ becomes smaller. So of course with a stronger assumption, the certified radius will become larger. And it seems to me that the authors are aware that $\\eta$ does not make the bound tighter, as they mentioned at the top of page 6 as well as in Eqn. (54) in Theorem 4. This even baffles me more why the authors would claim that EGG could lead to \"much tighter constant factors\" (in the first contributioin).\n\nEmpirically, Table 2, if it is correct, shows that EGG only with $\\eta = 8.0$ has a very marginal improvement over DSRS. However, before Theorem 1, the authors wrote \"all EGG with $\\eta \\in (0,2)$ have the potential to break the curse\", which is not verified by Table 2, and seems to contradict with $\\eta = 8.0$ in the experiments.\n\nIn conclusion, this work in a very large part is the same as a prior work, its claims are quite misleading, and it contains fundamental errors. Thus, I recommend rejection."

(2022), so there is no need to write the proof again. The extension of that theorem to $\\eta \\neq 2$ is very straightforward and only requires a brief explanation. Please also see my comments in the ethics review section."

I am not flagging for ethics review, only because it is possible that the first author is a junior student who just started doing research, and I want them to know that a submission with so much similarity with prior work but without proper reference is not acceptable. It is necessary and crucial to clearly label in the paper which results are from prior work, which results are new, and how the new things are different from prior work. For example, if Theorem 1 is exactly the same as a previous result up to paraphrasing, then this previous result must be clearly cited alongside Theorem 1, and the same proof should not be written again. If a theorem is a generalization or an extension of a previous result, then the difference between the two results should be elaborated."

By theory, EGG distribution should yield certified accuracy no smaller than DSRS. However, EGG has smaller certified accuracy in some cases in Table 2, which suggest there is a variance issue. So it's good to report variance.\n3. Marginal improvement: for most of the cases in Table 2, the improvement is no larger than 0.5%.

When introducing DSRS in Section 3, the values of $A,B$ are somewhat glossed over, leaving the reader to wonder what they are and where they come from. You mention that you can estimate them through Monte Carlo sampling, but no formulas are given to perform those estimates. How are $A$ and $B$ defined mathematically? Also, you state \"In a nutshell, we find the maximum $\\lVert\\delta\\rVert_2$ that makes the worst probability...\". This is somewhat vague. Are you saying that you maximize over $\\delta$ in an \"outer-maximization\" after solving the minimization (4)? In other words, it would be good to clarify how exactly the certified radius of DSRS is defined mathematically, and how that definition relates to (4).\n7. It looks like your statement of Lemma C.3 should be \"at labeled example $(x_0,y_0)$\", not just \"at input $x_0$\".\n8. The way Theorem 2 is stated, it does not appear that you are solving the dual problem (8), but rather giving specific formulas for the objective and constraints based on specific EGG density functions. If this is indeed the case, then you should re-word your descriptions to be more accurate (i.e., do not call your result a closed-form solution to the optimization problem). How are you actually solving the dual in practice (for the dual variables $\\nu_1,\\nu_2$)? This should be made more clear to the reader.\n8.
