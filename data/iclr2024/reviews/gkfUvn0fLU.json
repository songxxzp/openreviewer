The application of a local hill-climbing algorithm, the Nelder-Mead threshold search, is also shown and validated through numerical experiments.\n\n\n**Significance**\n\nIn the broader perspective of RLHF, managing overoptimization is a critical challenge. By estimating the thresholds that may cause a drop in performance and incorporating them in the optimization process, this paper makes a significant stride in improving the robustness and reliability of reinforcement learning models."

However, in Section 5, the authors mentioned that the RM weightings in PPO-SAT are fixed. Can you please provide clarity on the workings of PPO-SAT?\n\n- In Figure D.2, for All-PPO, why is the tanh function used for constraints that seem to be inequality constraints?
