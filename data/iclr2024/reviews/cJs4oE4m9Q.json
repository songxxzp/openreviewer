Each case contains several datasets. The comparison to SOTA methods seems superior for the DOHSC and DO2HSC proposed model. \n\n- The proposed architecture is applicable in graph data based on the optimization of (16) function."

Does Proposition 2 mean the distance (to the original or hypersphere center) based anomaly score in high-dimensional space are not reliable? If yes, the authors may add a few words to the last paragraph in Section 2.2.1 to provide a hint or motivation for the new anomaly score defined by (9).\n4. Given Proposition 2, in the high-dimensional space, the normal data are already far away from the origin. Why do we need to further push them to the outer hypersphere, namely, performing the hypersphere compression to reduce the thickness of the shell?\n5. Are $r_{max}$ and $r_{min}$ fixed or adjusted adaptively?\n6. In Proposition 3, when $r_{min}=r_{max}$, $\\kappa$ is infinity. Does this still make sense?\n7. What make graph anomaly detection special compared to image and tabular data anomaly detection? \n8. In Section 3.1, the authors mentioned a comparison method FCDD, but Table 2 doesn\u2019t include the corresponding result.\n9. In Appendix K, the authors showed the results of imbalanced experiments of graph data. Does it mean the results on graph data in the main paper are from balanced experiments?
