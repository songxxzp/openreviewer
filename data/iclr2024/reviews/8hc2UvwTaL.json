The authors identify the key challenge of this problem is the data heterogeneity. In this paper, the authors propose two variants of the central AIM algorithm, DistAIM and FLAIM. Compared with DistAIM, the FLAIM is expected to rely on a more light-weight secure aggregation algorithm. The authors show the proposed algorithm can outperform the naive implementation of AIM in a federated learning setting."

In the algorithm, $\\sigma_i$ (in line 14) may not be clearly defined (not sure whether it is used with $\\sigma_t$ interchangeably)."

What is the $\\tilde{N}$ and $\\sigma_i$ in line 14 of Algorithm 1?\n3. Is there any theoretical performance guarantee for the algorithm?\n4. Why is secure aggregation not applicable to the DistAIM?\n5. What assumption of trust between participants and compute servers is relaxed when switching from DistAIM to FLAIM? How much overhead is reduced because of cryptographic protocol changes? \n6. Why does AugFlaim (non-private) have worse performance than AugFlaim (private)? Does it mean too accurate heterogeneity information hurts the algorithm's performance? \n7. Why there is no AugFlaim (non-private) results in Figure 2f?"

The proposed approach is evaluated on benchmark datasets and compared to other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improved utility while reducing overhead. This paper offers valuable insights into the challenges and solutions related to SDGs in a federated setting. The FLAIM algorithm proposed in the paper shows the potential to create effective synthetic data while maintaining privacy. The empirical study emphasizes the significance of considering heterogeneity in Federated Learning and the trade-offs between privacy and utility performance."

Firstly they consider a version of it implemented in secure multi-party computation (SMC), though they allow only a fraction of the data holders to be present at each step, introducing some extra error compared to using AIM. They then try to remove most of the heavy SMC by switching to a method based on federated learning, which introduces some more error from heterogeneity in the dataset. They then largely mitigate this new error using a private estimate of the heterogeneity to improve client choices.\n\nThey also provide an experimental section that shows that they do indeed get accuracy improvements from the parts of the algorithm designed to improve accuracy on various datasets."
