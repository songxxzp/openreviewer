How do the authors determine the temperature used for calibration? Is there any evidence that the final score is truly calibrated with temperature scaling on the selected datasets?\n\nii) The proposed uncertainty score for task sequence variation seems over-simplified. First, it is a direct application of the definition of entropy. Second, the proposed score is only useful when the testing cases have the (a_1, a_T) tuple seen during training. How does the proposed score deal with the scenario where a_1 and a_T are seen during training, but their combination (a_1, a_T) are unseen?\n\niii) Considering the simplicity of the proposed method, the experiment set-ups are not comprehensive and convincing. To be specific, the authors only consider adding one additional visual observation for all the experiments. It is necessary to consider adding more observations and examine the effectiveness of the proposed method under that circumstance.\n\niv) The baseline model is not a good competitor. Randomly selecting additional observations is expected to perform poorly. Also, it is unclear how this random selection is performed. Since there is only one additional observation allowed (the one near the temporal center of the video clip), I would assume that in this set-up the model randomly decides whether to include this observation or not. This could be explicitly mentioned in the text."

The authors of this paper argue that visual observations and the reasoning process are fixed (i.e., kept constant) throughout the planning process, which fails to account for the interactivity of agents and uncertainty that typically arises in the real world.\n\nThe paper proposes active procedure planning in instructional videos; in this setting, agents (e.g., a planning model) can make additional intermediate observations to disambiguate the states and constrain the planning trajectories during testing. The central challenge then becomes how to select a subset of intermediate additional observations to enhance planning accuracy while keeping the cost within a predefined budget. The proposed approach is uncertainty-aware, meaning an agent will use additional observations only when there is uncertainty. This is achieved by measuring the uncertainty arising from task sequence variation and the uncertainty related to the model's prediction confidence.\n\nExperimental results provide empirical evidence regarding the effect of active procedure planning with uncertainty awareness on the accuracy of the generated plans."

While additional visual observations lead to improvements in the generated procedure plans, they also increase the computational burden. There is a clear efficiency-performance tradeoff, yet an analysis of this is currently absent. Could you quantify the increase in inference time and memory usage incurred while achieving performance gains?\n\n3. From an application standpoint, how realistic or significant is the proposed active procedure planning setup? How could additional intermediate visual observations be made available at the time of testing? Conventional procedure planning is understandable, as one can envision a scenario where a human provides a robot with a photo of available ingredients (initial visual observation) and a photo of a prepared dish (goal visual observation), asking the robot to generate a sequence of steps as the procedure plan. However, it is challenging to imagine how a robot could access intermediate additional visual observations when it is uncertain in the aforementioned application scenario."
