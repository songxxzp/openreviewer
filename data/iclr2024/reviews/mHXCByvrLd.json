This contribution of the paper is insignificant, as it is barely a direct application of  Extremal Optimal Transport [1], without providing a new understanding of offline RL or solving/alleviating existing problems in offline RL.\n2. The idea is not convincing. It is hard to see why we should consider an offline RL task an OT problem. Why do we want to preserve the distribution of $\\mathcal{A}$ instead of considering the distribution $\\mathcal{A}(s)$ or support $Supp(\\mathcal{A}(s))$ independently for each state? According to my understanding, offline RL considers the distribution $\\mathcal{A}(s)$ instead of the distribution of $\\mathcal{A}$, as shown in W-BRAC (eq. 8).\n3. XMLR does not seem better than W-BRAC. As stated in 2, the theoretical foundation of XMLR is not convincing. Furthermore, in practice, XMLR faces the same problems as W-BRAC. 1) both of them train an additional discriminator $f$. 2) both have a hyper-parameter to control the extreme of the policy, which is difficult to choose. \n4. The experimental results are not surprising. According to Table 2, the results of XMRL are close to the results of ReBRAC.\n5. The Writing should be improved. Typos, e.g., in the first line in section 2.4, should be fixed.\n\n[1] Gazdieva, Milena, et al. \"Extremal Domain Translation with Neural Optimal Transport.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.12874 (2023)."

When using the Wasserstein distance, this leads to the W-BRAC algorithm from [Wu et al, 2022]. This paper overcomes some drawbacks of BRAC and related methods (choice of regularizing hyperparameter and Lipschitz constraints) by looking at offline RL as a saddle-point problem that arises from the dual form of the Kantorovich problem, and leveraging standard duality machinery. To avoid inefficient actions (stichting between \u201cgood\u201d trajectories in the dataset), set inclusion constraints are replaced by inequality constraints, providing extremal transport in some cases. The proposed method, which appears to be sensitive to a regularizing hyperparameter, provides improvements over relevant baselines in the MuJoCo and Antmaze benchmarks."
