                "value": "- It seems like PTF is the most relevant and competitive baseline. Per 4.1, the authors compare with an abridged version of PTF however. If you use the same tricks that PTF used (e.g., mask rearrangement -- maybe mask tuning), would your method outperform PTF?\n- Figure 1 is a bit complicated to look at. One possibility is to break up this figure into two (the left vs. the right). The details are nice, but they detract from the main point (e.g., the activation difference and the final difference in logit distribution). The logits could be illustrated as two histograms, highlighting their difference.\n- The double axis in Figure 2 right is really confusing. Maybe just add a 5th plot? Might not be so easy to see for anyone with color blindness.\n- How long does the search take to run? On the order of minutes? Hours? Days? PFT said it took minutes, so that seems like the baseline. Is there significant latency overhead in storing and fetching large activations in RAM, especially for vision models?\n- The paper's motivation could be stronger. The abstract and title focus heavily on \"without retraining\" but it seems like many previous papers already focus on the post-training regime (as the paper cites). The more important motivation is then: What is PFT lacking that is present in this method? *Why is that difference important, intuitively?\n\n\nSummary: In short, I'm very lackluster about the paper. The results seem reasonable, but the motivation and the presentation (figures for example) can be improved to make a more convincing case."
