As the identity of post-treatment covariates is presumed unknown to the analyst, there could be a source of bias in estimating treatment effects. A deep balancing neural network, PoNet, was proposed to address this issue by incorporating a mutual information regularizer and a reconstruction loss to separate the covariates in latent spaces. Experiments on several datasets show that PoNet achieves better performance than common baselines."

The assumption that the analyst is unaware of which covariates are confounders and which are post-treatment variables seems quite rare in real-world scenarios. Typically, domain knowledge or prior information can help identify confounders. Therefore, the practical applicability of this assumption in real-world problems may be limited. \n2. In cases where the analyst genuinely has no prior knowledge of the causal structure, there are established methods in the causal inference literature for discovering causal relationships from observational data. For example, conditional independence tests can be applied to recover the causal structure, especially since post-treatment variables induce v-structures. This approach may offer a more direct and interpretable solution compared to encouraging conditional independence in an embedding space using mutual information regularizers as in the proposed method. Also, testing conditional independence in the original space seems to be a simpler problem compared to requiring conditional independence in an embedding space.\n3. The decoupling approach that combines the reconstruction loss and the mutual information regularizer seems to be a heuristic one since it does not really guarantee that the covariates are properly separated into pre-treatment and post-treatment ones, which could hurt the reliability of the proposed method."

The method discuss post-treatment covariates in two scenarios: mediation and collider biases, and provided a solution using feed-forward neural networks. The network structure is inspired by the classic TARNet, which employs two branches for treated and untreated subjects. Experiments are conducted on a selection of synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets."

In Figure 1(b), the collider case of post-treatment bias, would a variable decomposition CATE estimator (e.g., TEDVAE) be able to address this scenario? This also relates to the MIMIC-3 dataset and may explain why TEDVAE performs the best among all the other compared baselines. \n\n3.

Conditioning on more information doesn't always improve ATE or CATE estimation. Distinguishing types of variables as pre- or post-treatment is a valuable, albeit difficult, goal. \n\nThis discussion in mind, there are a few factors serving as perceived weaknesses. \n\nThe paper as currently presented spends some time and effort on establishing the well-known problem of post-treatment basis as a problem (e.g., see Abstract and Section 2.2). Some of this is certainly useful to remind readers of the problem as motivation, but the issue is well-known so less emphasis on that would help highlight the contribution here more squarely. Then, Theorem 1 could be better connected to the post-treatment bias problem, with the key point seeming to be that, under a certain causal structure, knowledge of the conditional distribution of pure confounders and post-treatment variables given all the variables \n\nThere are also some aspects to the paper that seem to distract from the main point. For example, the discussion of MIMR is framed as a contribution of the paper (\"We propose a Mutual Information Minimization Regularizer (MIMR)\"), although I think it could be somewhat further emphasized what problem the regularization is trying to solve (I appreciate the empirical results on the MIMR, however). \n\nAnother thought concerns use of the proposed DAG. Post-treatment variables are presumably omnipresent, and it can be difficult to know how to proceed when they are around (motivating this paper). For applicability in practice, I do not know when or whether investigators would be willing to assume the proposed graph in Figure 1c. Knowing more about the limitations of the proposed approach would help (e.g., discussion of limitations [the paper does not seem to currently have a limitations section]). For example, if I just have a single covariate, and I don't know whether it is a pre- or post-treatment variable, the proposed method would not work (at least according to my understanding of the paper). How many covariates one \"needs\", and information like that, would be helpful to contextualize the strengths and limits of the contribution. \n\nOverall, the selected rating balances (a) the importance of the problem faced, but (b) perceived limitations with overall clarity of presentation, as well as perceived practical limitations regarding the method's use. \n\nA few detailed points: \n\nThe text ''separation of confounders\" should read \"Separation of confounders\" on p. 5."
