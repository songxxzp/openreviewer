While the proposed analysis seems to be based on very limiting assumptions, it could provide an important basis for future works in human-autonomous vehicle interaction. Perhaps from a multiagent systems researcher's perspective, the closest work to this paper is from Loftin & Oliehoek (2022), who also explored regret bounds when dealing with adaptive partners (that can be humans). Nonetheless, this work does not account for a human partner's bounded rationality in their theoretical analysis and is limited to fully cooperative settings.\n\n**Major Strength - Clarity**\n\nIn general, I find the paper to be clearly written. I especially appreciate the authors pointing out which factors of the human or autonomous vehicle's decision-making each theorem/analysis addressed. That helped the readers to stick with the overall flow of the paper, which is always challenging with papers proposing lots of theoretical analysis.\n\nCitations:\n\nLoftin & Oliehoek. 2022. \"On the Impossibility of Learning to Cooperate with Adaptive Partner Strategies in Repeated Games\".

                "value": "**Minor Weakness - Quality - Missing Citations to Related Works**\n\nWhile not limited to their applications to autonomous vehicles, there are works in multiagent systems concerned with interaction against partners (including humans) whose decision-making processes (which encompass many things, such as their beliefs, goals, policies, bounded rationality, etc.) are unknown. These works can usually be found in the literature on ad hoc teamwork [1], zero-shot coordination [2], or opponent modelling [3].  Following how human-autonomous vehicle interaction can be modelled using the formulation described in these research areas, there should be a reference to these works in the paper.\n\n**Minor Weakness - Quality - Problem Formulation**\n\nThe decision to model the interaction as an MDP is also questionable. It specifically goes against the original formulation of MDPs to have the environment output two reward functions (one function each for the human and autonomous vehicle). In this case, would it not have been better to model the problem as a Dec-POMDP (or any other multiagent systems formulation)?\n\n**Major Weakness - Quality - Non-Adaptive Policy Assumption**\n\nAs highlighted by the authors themselves, a major weakness of this paper lies in the assumption that human and autonomous vehicle policies do not change/adapt during interaction. This assumption plays an important role in the analysis where teammate actions are assumed to be fixed when establishing the regret upper bounds of the autonomous vehicle's decision-making process. But this, overall, seems like an unrealistic assumption in real-world human-autonomous vehicle interaction.\n\nIn general, I highly recommend the authors to consider the concept of adaptive regret [4] in their analysis. Unlike the notion of regret used in this work, adaptive regret accounts for the possible change in a partner's decision-making process during interaction.\n\n**Minor Weakness - Quality - Misrepresented Contribution**\n\nIn the final sentence in the introduction, the authors claimed that they investigated the effects of different learning strategies on the learning performance achieved through the human-autonomous vehicle interaction. Unfortunately, the analysis in Section 4 did not exactly achieve that and instead settled with analyzing the effects of an autonomous vehicle's approximation errors on the overall regret. If the authors wanted to stick with the original claim, it would have been better if they formulated different types of learning algorithms and analyzed the effects on the regret bounds (see Section 5 of [4]). Otherwise, the authors should adequately adjust the reader's expectations in the introduction by being more direct about which factors' effects on the regret bounds are analyzed.\n\n**Major Weakness - Significance**\n\nI am concerned with the significance of this work. First, it seems based on highly restrictive assumptions that would not hold in real-world scenarios, where humans will adapt to the autonomous vehicle's policy. While this could have been fine had there been no previous theoretical analysis on dealing with adaptive partners, Loftin and Oliehoek (2022) [4] have introduced concepts for this kind of analysis. To improve the significance of this work for the community, I would expect the authors to build their analysis from the adaptive regret concept [4].\n\nAt the same time, there isn't a sufficient analysis of the effects of different autonomous vehicle learning algorithms on the overall regret in this paper. This generally limits the usefulness of this work for other people working on learning algorithms for autonomous vehicles. All in all, I doubt this work can significantly influence future work in this field.\n\nCitations:\n\n[1] Mirsky et al. (2022). \"A Survey of Ad Hoc Teamwork Research\". EUMAS 2022\n\n[2] Hu et al.
