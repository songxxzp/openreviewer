                "value": "The paper proposes a method called GRaph-Augmented Score Propagation (GRASP) for enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in graphs. It propagates OOD scores among neighboring nodes to leverage graph structure. The paper investigates whether score propagation will always help graph OOD detection. The authors find the ratio of intra-edges (ID-ID and OOD-OOD) to inter-edges (ID-OOD) must be high for propagation to be beneficial. To improve this ratio, GRASP strategically adds edges to a subset G of training nodes that are assured to be in-distribution. This enhances the intra-edge ratio and thus OOD detection performance after propagation. Theoretically, the paper shows that if G connects predominantly to ID data over OOD data, GRASP can provably improve post-propagation OOD detection outcomes. The paper evaluates GRASP on benchmark graph datasets and pre-trained GNNs. It demonstrates GRASP outperforms baselines\nOverall, the paper is well-written and provides good insight. However, the experiment was all conducted on small-scale of data, which  limits the ability to fully validate the proposed approach and conclusions. More experiments on large-scale real world data would strength the claims."
