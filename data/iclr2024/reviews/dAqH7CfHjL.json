Furthermore, the authors provide evidence that employing more potent 'non-destructive' augmentations during pretraining may accelerate the occurrence of phase transitions."

But we also know that data-augment prevents the learning of shortcut solution (such as only focusing on color distribution in images) in contrastive learning. Is there a way to relate phase-transition in the representation to the learning of specific features and how it avoids potential shortcut?"

For instance, to argue how a phase could be stable, it is stated that the exponential terms must dominate the expression for the matrix cosine, which requires $cos_t \\approx c^1_i / \\sqrt{c^2_i}$. But, in fact, these quantities depend on a complex ratio of matrix power series, which themselves depend on the eigendecomposition of the matrix B, which itself is computed from a Cholesky factorization of the expected outer product of the additive data augmentation vectors, and this of course depends on the distribution from which augmentation vectors are sampled. When would such a criteria ever be satisfied in practice and how would you know by looking at your data or your data augmentations?\n* Why do you not observe phase transformations in the linear setting? How would you re-design your problem based on your theory to observe phase transitions?\n\n### Physics Dataset\n* It is not clear to me whether observations in the physics dataset originate from the rough theoretical motivation developed in the linear setting.\n* It is also not clear to me how hyper-parameter considerations (learning rate/schedules/etc.) affect any observed behaviours in terms of the geometry of the representation space.\n\n### Image Datasets\n* Quite frankly, I do not see any significant phase transition based on the ARI metric or the AMI metric.\n* The low-dimensional clusterings of the image representations for supervised contrastive learning show that supervised contrastive learning clusters images form the same class together during training, however, this has already been observed in the literature, and I'm not sure that there are any new interesting intuitions about how the geometry of the representation space evolves.\n* Not clear to me how the theory in the linear setting has contributed to explaining the progressive image clustering in this supervised contrastive learning setting."
