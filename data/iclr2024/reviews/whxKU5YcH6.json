                "value": "Drawing upon the observation of prevalent substructure differences between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) graphs, this paper introduces SGOOD, a graph-level OOD detection framework. SGOOD enhances OOD graph detection by incorporating mpre substructure information into ID graph representations. It achieves this through the creation of super graphs of substructures, the implementation of a two-level graph encoding pipeline, and the utilization of three graph augmentation techniques for graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SGOOD in graph-level OOD detection tasks."

                "value": "1. The motivation to improve graph-level OOD detection by encoding more substructure information into graph representations is unclear.\n2. The notion that encoding more substructure information into graph representations will enhance graph-level OOD detection faces skepticism. In practice, theoretically more powerful GNNs often under-perform their 1-WL equivalent counterparts across various graph datasets [1]. This is due to the fact that, in cases where node attributes can function as supplements to structural information, nearly all graphs can be differentiated by 1-WL equivalent GNNs. Substructures do not exist in isolation, and are accompanied by a lot of attribute information. Furthermore, these concerns are verified by the results presented in Table 7. Specifically, more powerful GNNs like NGNN and GNN-AK+ fail to outperform 1-WL equivalent GNNs SAG, TopK, and DiffPool in the graph-level OOD detection task. \n3. This paper lacks a clear definition of the graph distribution, and it does not explore the factors contributing to the distribution differences between ID and OOD graphs. It places excessive emphasis on the influence of substructures in graph-level OOD detection while neglecting the discussion of node attributes. Two graphs with identical structures but distinct node features may exhibit entirely different distributions.\n4. The paper does not explicitly delineate the specific contributions of the proposed method, SGOOD, to the graph-level OOD detection task. Given the existence of many  theoretically more powerful GNNs, it remains unclear why SGOOD better than those GNNs in the graph-level OOD detection task. SGOOD appears to resemble a new GNN with powerful expressiveness rather than a specialized GNN that can identify OOD graphs.\n5. Author wrote: \"For augmentations, intuitively, if more information about training ID data is preserved, it is easier to distinguish unseen OOD data. The substructure-preserving graph augmentations are designed to achieve this. \" Please provide further explanation for \u201cmore information\u201d. What we need to do is to embed all the information related to the substructure into the graph representation? In [2], authors proposed that encoding the task-agnostic (e.g., graph classification task-agnostic) information into representations can improve the OOD detection task. \n\n[1] Dwivedi  et al.

                "value": "1. Table 1 lacks clarity, making it difficult for readers realize the ID and OOD graphs used in statistics, and these statistical findings rely on prior knowledge.\n2. GNNsafe appears to be primarily designed for node-level OOD detection. How can it be implemented at the graph-level?\n3. OCGIN, OCGTL, and GLocalKD are predominantly designed for graph anomaly detection, and their use as comparison algorithms may not be entirely appropriate for graph-level OOD detection.\n4. Figure 1 does not effectively convey how SGOOD is specifically tailored for the graph-level OOD detection task."
