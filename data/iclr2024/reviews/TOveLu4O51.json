The authors do not address this fact when they compare to other methods.\n- The effect on fluency, measured by perplexity has been evaluated only on the RealToxicityPrompt dataset.

Their technique provides what looks like small gains over the DEXPERTS technique under their metrics. I would appreciate more analysis for why their formulation is preferable over DEXPERTS, and in which cases DEXPERTS might fail that their method would not.\n* I would appreciate more qualitative examples of detoxification in the paper.\n* I do not see mention of code release.\n* Is perplexity the best measure of fluency? I would expect to see some human evaluations of generated text to confirm. \n* I am not sure if most readers are familiar with the \"Distinct-2/3\" metrics of diversity, I would appreciate a brief explanation of this metric in the paper."
