A formal definition should for example define that the class sets between the feature extractor's training set and the set being clustered as disjoint; this is important to avoid problems like the unfairness of comparing CLIP embeddings on equal grounds.\n- On a related/followup note: Including comparisons against CLIP on the same grounds is unfair to other feature extractors and detracts from the \"zero-shot\" nature of the task. Because it is not possible to determine if the classes (or even the samples themselves) were present the the CLIP training set, the results on CLIP should be included as extra information and treated as such. The current discussion is hindered by comparing against CLIP directly as readers are not able to properly judge the quality of the feature extractor's generalization.\n- The hyper parameter sweep (second stage) considers parameters only for Agglomerative Clustering (AC), with only HDBSCAN also getting any parameter evaluation (albeit for a single parameter choice). K-means could have it's distance metric changed as well as have an alternative formulation with automatic K (elbow method or even using silhouette score itself). Affinity Propagation also has hyper parameters that could be candidate for a sweep. The lack of experimentation with the other clustering methods raises concerns regarding the final results as AC ends up being the recommended method. \n\nOther notes:\n- First paragraph is missing a period.\n- Default parameters may change over time on packages such as scikit-learn. It is better to include all of the necessary information for reproduction (either on th main manuscript or on a supplementary material file).\n- Figure 1 and 2 are hard to read due to change in order. It might also help to include the actual average ranking number on the plot.\n- Sec. 4.1: authors did not mention which findings from Vaze et al. are corroborated (include the insight instead of only the result) \n- Conclusion: Performance was not equal or comparable on fine-grained datasets"

There has been a long-standing image clustering and deep image clustering community (e.g.https://github.com/zhoushengisnoob/DeepClustering) that measures the accuracy of clustering directly. This has became the most important metric to measure clustering performance. \n\n- Is this work truly the **first** investigation into zero-shot clustering of SSL feature?: Since 2020, there has been lots of work focusing on image-clustering based on a pretrained (SSL) image encoder. The papers have shown that (1) zero-shot clustering can have non-trivial performance (similar to the result of this paper) (2) Performance can be further improved with different finetuning methods. I think it is important to acknowledge the previous works and reconsider the novelty of this work. \n\n- Some issues with definition and terminology: CLIP is not self-supervised, it is rather supervised/language-supervised/weakly-supervised.\nMoCo/DINO/VICReg have a lot in common. Last year's ICLR best paper candidate has shown a strong duality between the methods, so it would be more accurate to just say they are contrastive. \n\n- Writing and Presentation: I think the work can be improved a lot, with the current format."

The analysis of correlation between AMI and Silhouette score is useful, but again not strong enough to warrant acceptance \n- The results in Figure 1 and 2, especially Figure 1, have very wide error bars, meaning that the comparisons wouldn't be statistically significant. This is probably because of the use of the rank metric -- it would be better to see an aggregated performance metric which isn't as sensitive (like an average), resulting in some statistically significant results\n- Minor: In the Introduction, the paper mentions \"while the embeddings from an SSL-trained feature extractor can perform well on downstream tasks after fine-tuning the network, there has been little investigation into the utility of the embeddings without fine-tuning the network\" -- this is inaccurate, SSL methods have been extensively evaluated without finetuning via k-nearest neighbours and linear probing while keeping the encoder frozen (e.g. MoCov3, DINO).\n- Minor: the paper considers CLIP as a self-supervised method, whereas it is typically considered a weakly supervised method since the texts provide noisy supervision."

Here's a few things which come to mind but I am still not sure if they'll be enough:\n  - It would be interesting to see a connection between clustering scores and traditional SSL evaluations like k-NN, linear probes, or finetuned results -- do these move together in unison or are the clustering capabilities of a model's representations relatively unrelated to other evaluations?\n  - Why does agglomerative clustering perform well, or what makes certain methods perform better? Why does changing the architecture change the rank ordering?"
