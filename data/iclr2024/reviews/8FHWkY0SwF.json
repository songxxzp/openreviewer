                "value": "1. I believe the main issue with this paper is that the research motivation seems weak. The paper claims to primarily address the scenario where training sets are Non-IID among clients, and where within each client, the training and test sets are also Non-IID. However, I think existing Robust Federated Learning and Federated Domain Generalization methods are capable of handling the aforementioned scenario. Although these two methods primarily focus on the issue of Non-IID training and test sets within each client.\n\n2. The paper states, \"To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider the shortcut trap problem in personalized federated learning and analyze it by formulating the structural causal models for heterogeneous clients.\" While it's true that this paper is indeed the first to study the use of PFL+SCM to address the shortcut trap problem, existing Robust Federated Learning and Federated Domain Generalization methods can also address the shortcut trap problem. Therefore, the contribution of this paper appears to be limited.\n\n3. In Figure 1, I find the classification of the scenarios where RFL&FedDG are applicable not very accurate. In the scenarios where RFL&FedDG are applicable, the Test-test relation can also be IID or Non-IID.\n\n4. In the experimental section, the proposed model is only compared to FL and PFL methods. However, I believe it should also be compared to RFL and FedDG methods to provide more convincing experimental results.\n\n5. The experimental section lacks detailed information about the configuration of the model used in this paper. More detailed information is needed.\n\n6. The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed FedSDR method. While the authors mention some potential limitations in passing, a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and constraints of the method would be helpful for readers to better understand its applicability in different scenarios. \n\n7. Although the authors provide some high-level explanations of how FedSDR works, a more detailed discussion of the causal modeling framework and how it is used to address shortcut learning would be helpful for readers who are not familiar with this area of research."
