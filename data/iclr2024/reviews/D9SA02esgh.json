An implicit decoder (SIREN) learns a function (conditioned on the global representation) that assigns whether a given position is on a given neuron or outside of it.\n\nAuthors use an EM microscopy dataset of ~800 neuron morphologies, and perform comparisons to justify architecture choice, share classification results to validate representations, and showcase reconstructions from latent traversals."

For example, in the latent traversals, the intermediate shapes are broken pieces and not valid dendritic trees (Fig 5). This is further exacerbated by post-processing. \n> To enhance the quality of our reconstructed meshes used for visualization, we remove small components using a greedy algorithm that progressively adds com- ponents until at least 75% of the vertices are included.\n\n - W2. The volume bound has to be selected a-priori for the dataset. This approach seems to not be extensible for non-local morphologies (e.g. considering long range axons would require looking at the entire brain volume)\n\n - W3. It seems that the network has to be evaluated on points spread throughout the entire volume to create the iso-surface. This seems quite expensive to generate a single neuron's dendritic morphology.\n\n - W4. I think the following statement is a bit of an over-reach, since no tests are performed with out of distribution samples. \n> Moreover, this process serves as a testament to the model\u2019s generalization capabilities, as it effectively handles out-of-distribution samples.\n\n - W5. Overall, I think capturing connectivity (e.g. tree structure) should be a crucial ingredient in generative models for morphology. This is not captured in the current model. There isn't methodological novelty (Pointnets and SIREN are off-the-shelf components)."

Could the authors elaborate on the no encoder experiment? Specifically, how is this aspect trained, and what embeddings is this referring to:\n> Directly learning the embeddings (no encoder) produces the most accurate reconstructions, but the embedding space was not organized semantically at all\n\n - Q3. The soma position and coarse dendritic density are very suggestive of the cell types. In Fig 2, the representations seem organized by that. Is this a fair assessment? If so why is classification a good test of representations?\n\n - Q4. While not explicitly so, the volume is the same for the entire dataset, and the soma / origin of the dendrites contains layer information. Do the authors agree?\n> Some of the layer 6 cells are more dispersed as they morphologically resemble inhibitory and more superficial cells, and the model is not provided with the laminar location.\n\n - Q5. A comparison of classification results with something simple e.g. density representation / PCA of the neuron point cloud (with similar bounding boxes and normalization as chosen for the model here) would help assess the improvements better."
