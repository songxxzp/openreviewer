However, due to the authors' setting, this term automatically becomes 0. In this case, why can't one reuse the previous proofs, just replacing this term by 0? Does the introduction of compatible function approximation leads to new difficulties that need additional theoretical novelty to overcome them?"

Yes, the soundness of this paper is excellent. But right from Section 1.2, it's just about \"getting sota results compared to other works\". The main analyses idea in this work compared to others which helps improve the bounds are missing. To be honest, I am only familiar with high level analyses of (Chen et al 2022) and few generic two-timescale algorithms, which shares the AC analyses in this work. But I am totally missing the improvement bounds provided here! Just providing one line (below quote) as the core idea for the whole 50 pages analyses paper, does not provide any useful information.\n> In this paper, we design a novel approach to explicitly bound this error. The central idea is to construct an auxiliary eligibility trace with fixed feature to approximate the eligibility trace with time-varying feature (in the critic, we use k-step TD with compatible function approximation).\n\nSo please write more discussions and details for the main results and proof ideas. I understand this is presentation is limited by page restriction, but it can be done through a thorough writing process. For example, AC results can be pushed to appendix looking at the generality of NAC, or the other way around.\n\n- This paper considers average MDP formulation. Most of the comparisons in Table 1 and 2 are in the discounted setting. Please mention these important differences and make fair comparisons by arguing the connection between the two settings. I am not sure if this distinction is what is helping to reach current bounds. Thus my point above is super critical for the quality.\n\nI am open to discussions with the authors and reviewers to make sure the work quality matches the score, which I believe so at this point, but a potential reach to 8 definitely exists. All the best for future decisions!"

Also, given equation (5), it is unclear why \"This implies that as long as we can solve the finite dimensional problem Equation (4), linear function approximation with the compatible feature and parameter does not induce any function approximation error.\" could you elaborate on that?\n\n2. why $\\phi^\\top\\phi$ is a matrix in eqn(8)? in this case $\\phi^\\top \\theta$ is also a matrix instead of a scalar?\n\n3. For NAC analysis, you need an additional Assumption 3. Could you explain why this is needed for NAC but not for AC? Also, how is this related to the single concentrability coefficient defined for offline RL (def1 of [1], assumption3 in [2])?\n\n[1] Bridging offline reinforcement learning and imitation learning: A tale of pessimism, NeurIPS21,\n[2] Towards Instance-Optimal Offline Reinforcement Learning with Pessimism, NeurIPS21.\n\n4. You mentioned \"Our major technical novelty lies in analyzing the stochastic bias due to policy-dependent and time-varying compatible function approximation in the critic, and handling the non-ergodicity of the MDP due to the single Markovian sample trajectory.\" Where can I find the detail of this novelty in the paper?"
