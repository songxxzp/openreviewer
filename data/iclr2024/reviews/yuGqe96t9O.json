Both diamond and graphite in Fig. 1c only a few lines before the question consist of pure carbon but have different crystal structures and vastly different properties, which is known even to school students.\n\nAtomic types were used as easy attributes in almost all past representations, especially for property prediction. Hence there is no need to separately talk about stoichiometry.\n\nThe word \"problem\" appears once (in the quote below), though a writing a rigorous problem statement might have helped the authors to understand the unresolved challenges. \n\nQuote: \"it is still an open problem to construct appropriate descriptions of materials, there is a general agreement on effective descriptors that encompass the following principles \"Descriptors should 1) preserve the similarity or difference between two data points (preservativity), 2) be applicable to the entire materials domain of interest (versatility), and 3) be computationally more feasible to generate compared to computing the target property itself (computability)\". \n \nComment. If the problem is to find a complete invariant description of a periodic crystal, crystallographers solved this problem nearly 100 years ago by using Niggli's reduced cell of a lattice and then recording all atoms in so-called standard settings, see the book \"TYPIX standardized data and crystal chemical characterization of inorganic structure types\" by Parth\u00e9 et al, which applies to all periodic crystals, not only inorganic. \n\nHowever, all these standardizations have become obsolete in the new world of big and noisy data because the underlying lattice (not even a unit cell) of any periodic crystal is discontinuous under almost any perturbation, which is obvious already in dimension 1.\n\nFor example, the set Z of all integers is nearly identical to a periodic sequence with points 0, 1+ep_1, ..., m+ep_m in the unit cell [0,m+1] for any small ep_1,...,ep_m close to 0, though their minimal periods (or unit cells) 1 and m+1 are arbitrarily different. \n\nThis discontinuity was reported for experimental crystals already in 1965, see Lawton SL, Jacobson RA. The reduced cell and its crystallographic applications. Ames Lab., Iowa State Univ. of Science and Tech.\n\nA more recent example from Materials Project shows two nearly identical crystals whose unit cells differ by a factor of (approximately) 2\nhttps://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-568619\nhttps://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-568656\n\nMoreover, atoms in any material always vibrate above absolute zero temperature, so their positions continuously change. As a result, any crystal structure with fixed atomic coordinates in a database is only a single snapshot of a potentially dynamic object, especially for proteins whose structures are often determined often by crystallization. \n\nHence the new essential requirement for any (better than the past) representations of crystals is a proved continuity under perturbations of atoms. \n\nAny graph representation of a crystal or a molecule is discontinuous because all chemical bonds are only abstract representations of inter-atomic interactions and depend on numerous thresholds on distances and angles, while atomic nuclei are real physical objects.\n\nQuote: \"we propose a novel multi-modal representation learning framework for stoichiometry that incorporates readily available crystal structural information\"\n\nComment. If the problem was to determine stoichometry only from a crystal structure, this problem was resolved by the Crystal Isometry Principle, which (briefly) says that any real periodic crystal (with all atomic types, hence stoichometry) is uniquely determined (without any uncertainty) by the geometric structure of atoms (without chemical elements). \n\nSee Widdowson et al (NeurIPS 2022) for theoretical proofs and 200+ billion comparisons on the world's largest collection of materials (the Cambridge Structural Database). The underlying invariants have a near-linear time in the motif size and were used for property predictions by Ropers et all (DAMDID 2022) and by Balasingham et al (arxiv:2212.11246). \n\nSince atomic coordinates have continuous real values, the space of materials is continuously infinite. Hence any sixteen (16 million or any large number of) finite datasets cover an infinitely tiny subspace of measure 0 in the full representation space."

In particular, this papers addresses the challenge of polymorphism, which refers to the fact that a single stoichiometry can correspond to multiple, diverse materials due to the different ways in which atoms can be arranged to form thermodynamically stable structures. The paper presents a machine learning algorithm where the structural information of compounds available in a data set is used to train a probabilistic embedding of the stoichiometry via a contrastive loss. The model optimises the parameters of a multivariate Gaussian distribution such that the graph representations of a stoichiometry and the structural graph representations of its polymorphs is minimised, while maximising the distance to other structures. The evaluation includes various data sets focused on different material properties and comparisons with a diverse set of methods."

                "value": "I have enjoyed reading this paper, it is interesting and well written and generally the strengths of the paper outweigh my concerns, which I mention in the next section. I will highlight here some of these strengths.\n\nFirst of all, the paper identifies an important challenge in the application of machine learning methods for materials discovery. Namely, that the structural information of new materials is not readily available, as the standard way to obtain it depends of computationally expensive simulations, for example with Density Functional Theory (DFT). Therefore, many of the most accurate methods in the machine literature for modelling materials and molecules, which are GNNs that use the structural information as input, cannot be effectively applied to new candidates of which we may only know the composition. This is an important subject that has received relatively little attention and this paper proposes a method that seems to obtain good results on various benchmarks.\n\nThe extensive evaluation of the method is also a strength of this paper. The authors compare their method against several diverse baselines, on an array of data sets focused on different materials properties and they include an ablation study of some of the most important components of the algorithm.\n\nRegarding the method itself, I think it is an original and reasonable idea to use a contrastive loss between the structural representation of polymorphs and the stoichiometry representation of their composition. This still leverages the potential of GNNs to learn good structural representations, but allows using only the stoichiometry representation at inference time. I believe there could be multiple variations of the proposed method and I was initially skeptical of some of the specific details of the method, but the results seem to support the choices, and future work may explore other alternatives.\n\nFinally, the paper is for the most part well written and easy to follow - with some exceptions I discuss below."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I would encourage the authors to improve the clarity of the last part of the paper, namely Section 5. While the quality is not poor, I did notice a decrease in the quality and clarity of this section with respect to the methods part of the paper, which I found very clear. Note that the first paragraph of 5.1 contains a few typos or grammar mistakes. Also, the size of the figures in this section are too small.\n\nAn exception of this clarity in the methods section is Section 4.3, where I believe the notation is a bit confusing. For instance, $\\mathcal{P}^b$ is used here for the first time to refer to what I believe is the structural graph, previously referred to as $\\mathcal{G}^b$. Also, should the superscript not be $b$ instead of $a$ because it refers to the structural graph? In fact, the superscript of $z_p$ is $b$. Or perhaps I am missing something. In this section as well, $m$ is used in the conditional probability without defining it.\n\nAlthough there is additional information in the appendix, I would suggest to include some details regarding the data splits (train, validation, cross-validation) in the main paper as well to describe the evaluation protocol.\n\nMachine learning models that predict the structure given the stoichiometry can be reasonable or even better alternatives to richer representations of the stoichiometry as proposed here. I would have appreciated to find a discussion of the pros and cons of these two approaches and ideally a review of crystal structure prediction methods."

Does the structural graph contain information about the atoms species? I wonder if it is also the case, otherwise, that one structures actually corresponds to more than one stoichiometry. \n- Regarding the \"collapsed dimensions\" of the representation, I wonder whether it is actually due to the fact that some stoichiometries have no known polymorphs in the data sets and therefore their variance should in fact be zero.
