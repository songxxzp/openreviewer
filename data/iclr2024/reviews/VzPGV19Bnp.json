The most important contribution of the paper is that it proposes a framework without regularization techniques to prevent over-fitting in customized text-to-image generation. The encoder network, which converts the image containing the customized object into an embedding $S^*$, makes the diffusion model condition on that object. Unlike previous methods adopting regularization techniques to prevent over-fitting, this paper proposes a novel Profusion sampling method. By assuming $S^*$ and the arbitrary user input text $C$ are independent, the sampling method decomposes the noise prediction into two terms that take both $S^*$ and $C$ into consideration.\n3.

One may trade off the detail preservation for more creative generations or the other way around. Can the authors provide such trade-offs in the proposed framework?\n6.

Have you tried an even smaller regularization weighting, and what is the degree of detail lost then?\n2. In section 2.1, the observation is made that \"without regularization, the UNet has a tendency to overly prioritize the S* concept, and overshadowing C\". The question arises as to why feeding C independently into the UNet can address this issue, since the text-to-image mapping is not altered by the FusionSampling strategy."
