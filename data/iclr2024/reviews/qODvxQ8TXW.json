In the context of a single-layer neural network, the authors offer theoretical evidence that LRR can reliably rectify initially problematic weight sign patterns by inheriting the sign information from a well-trained overparameterized model. When applied to more complex neural networks, empirical findings validate that the observed changes in weight sign configurations align with the theoretical insights. Furthermore, the authors dissect the impact of LRR into two distinct components: sparse network optimization and the performance of the generated mask. Through rigorous experiments, they provide empirical support for LRR's exceptional performance in both of these aspects."

This research has the potential to serve as a source of inspiration for the advancement of more efficient sparse training algorithms that can leverage the power of mask sign configurations.\n- The paper presents carefully designed ablation studies investigating two distinctive roles of LRR in (i) sparse neural network optimization and (ii) discovering a good sparse mask.  \n- The paper is effectively structured and exhibits clear and concise writing\n- The paper covers a fair amount of relevant previous studies."

In other words, are both WR and LRR fully converged? If that\u2019s the case, does the mask configuration stay constant after convergence? Further, if the optimal mask can be attained only at the end of the training epochs, it could pose challenges in efforts to reduce the computational cost associated with IMP (both WR & LRR).\n- Concerning the flexible LRR mask analysis (see Figure 4), there appear to be some questionable findings. For instance, the \"LRR with IMP mask (blue)\" does not appear to show significant improvement over WR (orange) except for the case of Cifar-10 with a moderate level of sparsity. Moreover, it is unclear regarding the implication of \"LRR w/ BN rewind (yellow)\" in Figure 4 in the context of \"flexible LRR training.\"\n- In Figures 3 and 6, there are only two sets of experimental results available for analysis, Cifar-10 and Cifar-100. The authors argue that Cifar-100 results may not fully meet expectations due to its higher complexity. However, it remains an open question whether the same trend would hold for different network architectures, such as VGG networks."

One notable contribution is the discovery of parameter sign switching, a key characteristic of LRR. This not only reveals a unique facet of LRR but also offers new perspectives for understanding and designing more effective algorithms.\nThe article presents enough experiments as evidence. Firstly, it uses a single hidden neuron model for learning tasks, showing that LRR has more success cases than IMP because LRR can avoid problematic initial sign configurations.\nThe paper further validates LRR's advantage over IMP through a series of representative tasks and networks. Experimental results show that LRR performs well in standard benchmark tests such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny ImageNet, regardless of its combination with ResNet18 or ResNet50. These results strongly support the superiority of LRR over IMP in deep neural network training."
