The central thesis in this paper, which is summarised in its title, is that grokking occurs due to different implicit biases in early and late training.  Several theoretical results in support of this are proved for training by gradient flow homogeneous neural networks with large initialisations and small weight decay, for classification as well as regression tasks.  The pattern is that general theorems are proved first, and then corollaries are derived that explain grokking in specific settings, such as classification using diagonal linear networks, or low-rank symmetric matrix completion.  In the final section, the authors consider other scenarios where grokking occurs; they provide numerical experiments without weight decay for learning modular addition using two-layer ReLU networks, and they show how theoretical results from Li, Wang, and Arora in ICLR 2021 confirm grokking when training two-layer diagonal linear networks by label noise SGD with a sufficiently small learning rate."

Moreover, the versatility of the explanation in terms of the implicit biases is demonstrated by the identification of \"misgrokking\" in this paper, a dual phenomenon in which the test accuracy transitions from very high to very low late in the training.\n\nGrokking and misgrokking as indicated by the theory are verified by numerical experiments for classification using two-layer diagonal linear networks.\n\nFull proofs of the theoretical results are provided in the appendix.  The biggest and most novel are those of Theorems 3.3 and 3.7, which show that the small weight decay does not spoil the kernel regime and its implicit bias early in the training for long enough so that a relatively short transitional phase follows."

A minor comment is that I think that writing \"for all\" or \"for every\" is clearer than \"for any\".\n\nThe theoretical results about grokking for regression tasks, and in particular for overparameterised matrix completion, are not illustrated experimentally.\n\nThe conclusion of the paper (Section 5) does not seem to indicate any directions for future work."

Can the authors add more examples in text with datasets commonly used in ``Grokking'' literature?\n- One point that the paper makes is about identifying a transition time from memorization to generalization and attributes it to different inductive biases. This is not true when weight decay = 0 which is a case handled that the paper talks about as well. This suggestion weakens about the importance of the first phase as it may not even be necessary to understand ``Grokking''"

It suggests that grokking happens when the solution given by the early implicit bias generalizes poorly while the solution given by the late bias generalizes well. It is also shown that the converse phenomenon can happen which they call misgrokking. \n\nAs an example, the paper focuses on a simple diagonal linear neural net for classification and shows that the early and late bias resp. correspond to minimization of L2 and L1 margin. They also identify these biases for a matrix completion model. \n\nThe paper further provides experiments showing that grokking can happen even in the absence of weight decay."
