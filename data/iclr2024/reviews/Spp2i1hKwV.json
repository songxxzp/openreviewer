Why?\n- in Table 2:\n   a) please add an additional row that shows the best-known performance on each dataset; without it, it is impossible to quantify the practical impact of IDEAL (i.e., is \"just\" improving on Vote-k, or does it come close to the best-known performance?)\n   b) please also add to the Table results for k = 1,000 and even k = 10,000. How big are these improvements, if any?\n   c) please explain why do we see IDEAL(100) < IDEAL(18) on RTE. Is there a general lesson worth sharing?\n   d) similarly, why does Vote-k outperform IDEAL(100) on GeoQ (Tables 2 & 8). In particular, given that Table 8 suggest that there is a fair amount of variability among the various trials, ideally you should increase the number of trials to 10 or even larger. In the current setting, according to Table 8, for \"100\" Vote-k and IDEAL obtain the same best result (60.5) on GeoQ; similarly, for \"18\", there is a similar \"tie\" on HellaSwag, and Vote-k gets a better max on GeoQ.\n- section 4.3.1 should cover all datasets, not only two; worst case scenario, if space is an issue, you can summarize the results on all datasets here, and refer the reader to the appropriate appendix\n- same as above, section 4.3.1 should cover all datasets, not only three of them. Also: (i) why have Table 2 for \"18\" rather than \"100,\" when IDEAL(100) outperforms IDEAL(1*0 on all datasets, and (2) similarly to the above comment on stability, you should use at least 10 randomized trials. \n- same as above, section 4.4 should cover all datasets, not only five of them\n\nOTHER COMMENTS:\n1) please add early-on (e.g., in the Introduction) a few illustrative examples. For one or two of your application domains, you should show:\n- an un-annotated example that IDEAL selects for annotation\n- the annotated version of that example\n- the answer of the LLM w/o that annotated example used as a prompt\n- the answer of the LLM w/o that annotated example used as a prompt\n- explain and/or discuss the difference between the two answers above  \n\n2) please add to the paper a paragraph or two about the actual/expected cost of annotation for the various domains in the empirical evaluation.\n\n3) please intuitively explain the \"end-to-end\" term that you are using in the Abstract, Introduction, and later on in the Appendices, but nowhere else in the rest paper. If it is an important concept, it should also appear in the \"meat\" of the paper; if it is not, you should remove all references to it as it is distracting to see it mentioned early on, never clarified, and then simply ignored. \n\n4) both in Fig 3's caption and in the abstract, please summarize the running time improvements of IDEAL vs Vote-k. The current \"largely reduces the time cost\" is simply too vague. Ideally, the last sentence of the abstract should end something like this: \"... improving the performance by X% while reducing the running time by Y%\"\n\n\nNitpicks:\n- p 1: \"pretty performance\" --> \"strong performance\"\n- p 1: please add a reference and /or brief summary for \"requires substantial manpower and financial resources\"\n- p 2: \"Vote-k devoids theoretical guarantees\" --> \"Vote-k lacks theoretical guarantees\"\n- p 2: please explain why \"the algorithm does not need a delicate trade-off between diversity and representativeness\"\n- p 2: last paragraph of the Intro: please also quantify the performance improvement, not only the gains in speed\n- p 3: for Fig 2, please explain if/why the iterations start at (d).  \n- p 5: probably the theorem should be called \"Theorem 1\" (or else the reader expects to see a Theorem 1 before it)"

If it is true, it is very important to have a complexity analysis of running time. Second, I do not see how to consider the correlations among the retrieved samples. For greed search, there may be cases where A+B is better C+B, and C has more influence than A. I want to know how the proposed method addresses these cases. Furthermore, I also want to know how the proposed method leverages the features of each data sample. In other words, the nodes in the graph have their own features. How do you embed these features? Using sentence transformer or some GNN-based methods? And, what is the cost of applying these methods? Also, for the experiment, there are many demonstration selection methods in the NLP field, for example, similarity-based or diversity-based methods, which are widely employed in the LLMs. Therefore, I highly recommend the authors compare their method against these existing approaches. It would be great to see some results for more datasets (especially more tasks beyond the text classification) and more LLMs. Overall, I do not think this version is ready for publication."

                "value": "This paper presents a work on selective annotations in in-context learning. Given a pool of unlabeled instances to annotate for prompts, this paper proposes an influence-driven framework to identify those more significant data points for annotations and follow-up tasks. Compared with the previous method, the proposed method enjoys (1) greater convenience in selection due to the end-to-end manner; (2) it does not need to balance diversity and representativeness of selected instances; (3) theoretical analysis is provided to show the subset influence is at least as large as a certain proportion of the influence of the optimal solution. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to show the superiority of the proposed method, which achieves the best performance in most cases. The time consumption in selection is significantly lower than previous state-of-the-art methods."

This paper conducts comprehensive evaluations on the influence of selecting specific examples for inclusion in the prompt. The findings illustrate the substantial impact this choice can have on the final model's behavior.\n2.\tThe paper is well-structured and easily comprehensible. Within the evaluation section, there are numerous intriguing findings that hold significant value for dissemination within the wider research community. Besides, the source code is provided to ensure the reproducibility of the empirical findings. \n3.\tThe proposed method is simple and relatively straightforward to implement. Consequently, there is a possibility that it could be utilized in real-world applications of in-context learning.\n4.\tTheoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under a greedy search algorithm."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1)\tThe experiments can be supplemented by including other methods not just Random and Vote-k, as mentioned above. \n2)\tThe paper claims that it conducts experiments three times and reports the average score. What/where is the randomness? It mainly comes from examples selected or model predictions? Or both of them?\n3)\tFor the process of information diffusion, in the main paper, it seems that the process is only performed once. In the Appendix, the paper discusses that multiple processes are performed. I suggest that this description can be moved to the main paper. Also, what is the influence of the times of information diffusion? \n4)\tAdditional elaboration is required to explain why the combination of IDEAL/vote-k and similarity retrieval proves effective, while IDEAL/Vote-k alone, coupled with the random selection of supporting examples, does not work well. \n5)\tRecently, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has gained widespread adoption in in-context learning research. Several studies employing this method have reported enhanced model performance. However, an unexplored aspect of this approach is the model's sensitivity and variance concerning the retrieved prompts when used in conjunction with CoT. This work does not address whether such sensitivity exists and whether CoT can be applied for better performance.\n6)\tIs there any consideration given by the authors to the cost associated with encoding every unlabeled training instance using Sentence-BERT when comparing the methods? As far as I can discern, this aspect was not addressed in the paper.\n7)\tIt seems that the instance embedding has a large Influence on the proposed method since it needs to build a directed graph using the embeddings. I am interested in changing the previously used pre-trained models and seeing the robustness of the proposed method. \n8)\tThe paper shows the label distribution brought by the proposed method. What about the distribution of original data (before selecting)? Are their label distributions similar? Besides, a balanced distribution is expected to bring better performance in follow-up tasks? Or otherwise. I am interested in this."
