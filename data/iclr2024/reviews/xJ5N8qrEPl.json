Building upon this reformulation, a single-loop alternating gradient descent method is derived to efficiently tackle the constrained BLO.

                "value": "This paper presents a single loop proximal Lagrangian Value function-based Hessian-free Bi-level Algorithm (LV-HBA) for solving constrained bilevel optimization where the lower-level problem involves constraints coupling both upper-level and lower-level variables.\nThe authors relax the strongly convex assumption on lower-level problem to the general convex case, and provide non-asymptotic convergence analysis for LV-HBA. They also provide numerical experiments on the synthetic problem, hyperparameter selection problem and data hypercleaning task."

The authors propose a single loop Hessian free method that we refer to as Lagrangian Value function-based Hessian-free Bi-level Algorithm (LV-HBA). The authors provide non-asymptotic convergence analysis for LV-HBA, relaxing the underlying assumptions for lower level problem from strongly convexity to only convexity."

                "value": "1. Can the authors elaborate why there is no need to assume the Lipschitz continuity of the upper level function $F(x,y)$, which is typically necessary in bilevel optimization even the lower function is strongly convex, e.g. Xiao et al. (2023b).\n2. On page 6, the sentences after Assumption 3.2 say $f$ is $\\rho_f$-weakly convex on $X\\times Y$ with $\\rho_f\\ge 0$, which is potentially being smaller than $L_f$. Can you provide the exact form of $\\rho_f$ or show the case of $\\rho_f$ being smaller for some specific application? Does that mean we can only suppose $\\rho_f = L_f$ in general?\n3. Theorem A.1 says reformulation (4) is equivalent to constrained BLO problem (1). In the proof of Theorem A.1, it only illustrates that the feasible points of (4) and (1) are equivalent. It is unclear why this means the formulations (4) and (1) and are also equivalent. Can we conclude the optimal solution of (4) and (1) are equivalent?\n4. In reformulation (5), how to choose the parameter $r$?\n5. The proposed methods includes many hyperparameters, making difficult to implement in practice."
