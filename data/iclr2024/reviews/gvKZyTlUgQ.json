                "value": "\u201chomography learning is formulated into several simple pseudo-translation regressions\u201dThe 4pt representation (corner offsets) of homography estimation is already a 4 translation vector representation, where 4 translational vectors at the 4 corner of an image can uniquely defines a homography. A homography matrix is obtained by solving a DLT \n\nAccording to Eq. 5, b_i should be estimated in order to estimate a homography. However, these b_i is not with the same value range, for example, the translation b1 and b2 may orders larger than perspective components, b7 and b8, which introduces training difficulty.  This is why previous works adopt corner offsets that share a similar value range for the homography estimation instead of regressing homography matrix elements.  I'm not sure working in the Lie space could solve such problem. \n\nAssume it can, why it is better than corner offsets or homography flow representation is still not clear. Saying that \"incapable of estimating the large transformation\" is not accurate, given that some works already adopted corner offsets or homography flows for large homography transformations, e.g., \n\nJiang et al. Semi-supervised Deep Large-baseline Homography Estimation with Progressive Equivalence Constraint, AAAI 2023\n\nNie et al. Depth-Aware Multi-Grid Deep Homography Estimation with Contextual Correlation, TCSVT 2021\n\nFor experiments, more recent homography dataset should be adopted, e.g., the CA-Homo dataset, or AAAI 23 dataset, should be compared with, in which various deep-based, traditional feature-point matching, deep feature matching based approaches are reported. \n\nAuthors should put some efforts to demonstrate the limitations of previous homography representations, so as to show the advantages of the proposed new representation. These previous representations, either corner offsets, or homography flow, on the one hand, can achieve large baseline registration already, on the other hand, are flexible to be extended for multiple planes, e.g., mesh local homos, that can go beyond the single-plane transformation. The flexibility is also important."
