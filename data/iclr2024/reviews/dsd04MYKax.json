                "value": "**On relation to existing methods:**\n\nIn general, I feel many methods share similar features with SOP\u2019s Group Generator and Group Selector. Thus, it would be good to highlight the similarity and difference so that the reader can better judge the novelty of the approach. In particular, could the authors highlight in more detail how their method is similar and different to RISE and LIME. The masks in RISE seem to be equivalent to the groups in SOP, and RISE also combines the model\u2019s prediction z\u2019s (see Equations 1-6 in the RISE ref). LIME learns the weights on masked areas (see Section 3.4 in the LIME ref). Both methods seem to have some form of Group Generator and Group Selector. I think spelling out the similarities and differences would help a lot.\n\n**On model and evaluation details:**\n\nReading through Sections 2\u20144, I gathered the following questions related to the implementation and evaluation of the model. Overall, I feel some important details are missing or unclear in the paper.\n\nQuestions on Section 2:\n- The powerset P is not used in the equations. Should the last line of page 2 read \\Sum{S \\in P} instead of just S?\n- In Definition 1, I don\u2019t quite understand why the difference is between \\Delta f and \\sum a. A delta (difference) and a sum seem to be very different quantities to compare. Same question for Definition 2.\u00a0\n- Why is the range of \\alpha_i and f(x) R and not [0,1]?\u00a0\n- How is the y-axis in Figure 2 calculated? The scale is not what I expected. I was expecting something between 0 and 1, assuming f(x) gives a probability.\n- Is the exponential increase in Figure 2 simply a consequence of summing over a powerset of differences (and the size of the powerset grows exponentially with d)?\u00a0\n- The paper mentions that a linear model achieves 0 error as defined. Is this metric only 0 for linear models? Can a non-linear model have 0 error? Does SOP have 0 error? Perhaps going through the calculation of a simple case would help.\n- Could the authors clarify in what sense is SOP more faithful than LIME, RISE, and GradCAM? Perhaps theorems 1 and 2 give the answers already, but I am still not very clear after finishing reading the paper.\n\nQuestions on Section 3:\n- How are the parameters learned? What\u2019s the objective function and the learning algorithm?\u00a0\n- How does the Group Generator affect the outcome? For example, does the method work less well if a random generator is used? How about a generator like that used in Bayesian Teaching saliency map (see Methods section in [1])?\n- Want more clarity on the definition, construction, and intuition of the W\u2019s, C\u2019s, the sparsemax.\n- What does the \u201c, C z^T\u201d (especially the comma) mean in Equation (4)?\n\n[1] Yang, Scott Cheng-Hsin, et al. \"Mitigating belief projection in explainable artificial intelligence via Bayesian teaching.\" Scientific reports 11.1 (2021): 9863.\n\nQuestions on Section 4:\n- For the insertion and deletion metric, how did the authors choose the features to be removed one at a time from the SOP? Is some kind of averaging over groups done first?\n- Similarly, for the group insertion and deletion metric, how did the authors make the groups from the baseline methods? I read Appendix C.2 and can guess what might have been done, but I think it can be described more precisely. In general, it would be good to describe the implementations of the metrics more precisely.\n- It will be good to show the curves for the insertion/deletion metric and the grouped versions.\n\n**On the case study:**\n\nIt seems to me that the Void and Cluster types are known things to begin with, so it\u2019s unclear how the SOP groups helped provide insight. Also, what is the advantage of looking at the scores/weights c of the Group Selector compared to just using the backbone model\u2019s output z as the scores? In other words, I am still not very clear how the Group Generator offered more insight than the a priori known Void and Cluster, and how the Group Selector offered more insights than just the backbone model\u2019s prediction.\n\nIn general, while the SOP may have smaller group deletion and insertion error, it is more complex than a single attribution map. SOP is really also a ML model. This raises the question of how the user should use the SOP. Although the case study offers some indirect hints, it is not very clear to me how I should go about using it."

The auxiliary model learns to generate sparse masks (which subset the input\u2019s features in different ways), and these subsetted features are fed into the original model, and output embeddings from each feature subset (mask) are projected and summed to the target. That way, one can see which masks were given a high weight in the prediction, and those masks contain groups of features which have high importance. The authors provide some theoretical justification for why (in certain specific situations), groups of features offer more faithful interpretations than individual features. The authors benchmark against several other local-interpretation methods, and also provide a real-world example from cosmology."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "### There should be more analyses on the quality/interpretability of the feature groups (masks)\n\nAlthough the authors have done a good job on showing how their method offers improvements in insertion/deletion faithfulness, there is much less shown about the _quality_ of the feature groups/masks which are learned by SOP. The cosmology example is a good singular anecdote, but a more global analysis is needed to show that the interpretability of the feature groups is good. If the feature groups are very noisy and spread out all over an image (for example), then the method would not be very useful compared to another method which gives more contiguous or otherwise interpretable features. This is one of the core pieces that\u2019s holding this paper back, in my opinion, and it would be great to see: 1) some examples of identified features (i.e. like saliency maps) for some examples of images, comparing SOP with other explanation methods; and 2) a global analysis quantifying the quality of the feature maps, comparing SOP with other explanation methods. It would be great to see if SOP is able to generate feature groups which are faithful but also interpretable (or at least, not significantly less interpretable than other methods).\n\n### Theoretical justification is interesting, but it does not seem entirely applicable to motivate the work\n\nThe theoretical justification is certainly appreciated, but it does not appear entirely applicable to this work for a few reasons.\n\nFirstly, Theorem 1, Lemma 1, and Theorem 2 attempt to motivate the identification of feature groups by showing that for some specific models (i.e. multilinear monomial or binomial), there exists an $x$ where for any attributions $\\alpha$, there is a subset of features which has high error (exponential in the feature dimension). Importantly, these proofs always assume a fixed $x = \\mathbb{1}$. This is just one value of $x$, and even if interpretability is poor for this one value of $x$, one could claim that other values of $x$ might be better, and so focusing on this single instance of $x$ (which is unlikely to appear in real data) is not very strong.\n\nAdditionally, even with some given $x$ ($\\mathbb{1}$ or otherwise), it might not be realistic to consider the error of the worst possible subset. Not all subsets of features will be useful in interpretation, yet the error of all subsets is being summed together in the objective of the convex program. It may not be realistic to include all such subsets.\n\nFurthermore, Corollary 1 is proven for the case where $x = \\mathbb{1}$, and there is no formal justification for a general $x$ or general $p$. This is not a deal-breaker, but it should certainly be clarified that the theoretical motivation is over a toy example. Further justification should also be offered for why it is believed that this toy example can be generalized to real-world data and models. Otherwise, one could claim that all this theoretical justification is unrealistic and therefore inapplicable to the problem that SOP is trying to solve.\n\n### Experiments are limited to images\n\nThere are many other data modalities, and it would be nice to see other things outside of image datasets, which have their own biases, and are much easier than other modalities in certain ways. The real-world example, however, helps reduce this limitation of the paper. However, if images are the only data type being considered, it would be more reasonable to adjust the focus of the paper in writing to clarify that the work is focused on image datasets (although it may be tweaked to be applied to other datasets in future work).\n\nOn a related note, the paper assumes that the baseline image is the all-black image (all 0), but this is not a general assumption, especially in non-image datasets. Many of the Shapley-value works for interpretability are motivated (in part) by this observation. I don\u2019t expect it to be difficult to adjust the math and the implementation to account for non-zero baselines.\n\n### Some areas in the writing and presentation could be improved\n- Equation 1: it would be good to formally define feature attribution $\\alpha$; also, the powerset $\\mathcal{P}$ is not used anywhere in the equation\n- Typo in Equation 8\n- In Definition 3, $m_i$ is never used\n- Although SOP is being presented as a model-agnostic method, there is some reliance on the model architecture because of the need for a good embedding layer\n- The bolding can be misleading in Table 1; the meaning of the italics should be made clear in the caption, and Del of integrated gradients for ImageNet should be bolded\n- I did not understand this sentence until the second read of the paper: \u201cIn practice, we can initialize the value weight C to the linear classifier of a pretrained model.\u201d\n- More details on the architecture would be appreciated in the supplement"

            "questions": {
                "value": "- In the convex program, what is the optimal $\\alpha^{*}$ that is found? Because we are fixing $x = \\mathbb{1}$ and $p(x)$, technically we already have a good idea of what the \u201cright\u201d attributions should be, and most configurations of attributions would be highly unreasonable (which general interpretability methods would not identify at all)\n- There is certainly a connection to Shapley scores, which have the efficiency property; insertion and deletion error are closely related; having some background on this and explanation would be appreciated\n- There may also be a connection to Novello, et. al., 2022 (Making Sense of Dependence: Efficient Black-box Explanations Using Dependence Measure), which identifies feature importances based on masks, as well, although feature groups is not a core focus there\n- How does one choose the number of groups G? Once G is selected, are all of the G feature groups identified by SOP meaningful? Is there anything that prevents feature groups from being redundant? How can one select the most meaningful feature groups out of the G?\n- More on the problem of redundancy, for a single input example, the same feature can be present in multiple masks/subsets; does this pose an issue for interpretability in this framework?"

It has been known for a while that local linear approximations don\u2019t capture feature interactions, and several methods have been proposed for resolving this.\n- Very Important: The primary quantitative metrics in the paper are not presented with sufficient detail, and this leads to the results being difficult to interpret. Is a .02 improvement of SOP over SHAP good or bad? It sounds very small. Sometimes the improvements are smaller or SHAP outperforms SOP.\n- Important: While I like the case study, the conclusions are somewhat mixed. (1) It is said that the method helps cosmologists see that voids are more important for predicting the omega constant than sigma, because the feature attribution is on average 55.4% for omega vs 54% for sigma. Surely this difference is so slight that we cannot conclude much from it. (2) The method\u2019s explanations align with prior domain-specific knowledge (that\u2019s good). (3) It\u2019s said that explanations agree with conclusions from a 2020 study using gradient-based salience, and that it is \u201cimportant that we find consistent results with our attention-based wrapper.\u201d Why is it important to agree with a fundamentally flawed method from a previous study?\n- Important: The proposed method suffers an accuracy tradeoff with using the original deep learning model. The gains in explainability should be very clear in order to justify this. Since the gains in explainability are not very clear, this is a mark against using the proposed sparse attention-based model.\n- Of Some Importance: I just want to note that I do not think the theoretical analysis adds much to the paper in its current state. We have seen strong impossibility theorems for rich model classes in the past year (e.g. the cited Bilodeau et al 2022 paper). A result showing that a linear model is not a good approximatation of a very nonlinear model, especially in high dimensions, is not very novel."

Then we could compare methods along a Pareto curve showing accuracy vs interpretability tradeoffs among the methods. (I also suspect the reason for this, however, is that a sparse-max attention-based model on deep learning representations is not really close to being as \u201cinherently interpretable\u201d as e.g. a decision tree on tabular data, and the need for automatic quantitative metrics reflects this.)\n- Typo: \u201cwhere P is the powerset.\u201d P not in the definition\n- Typo: \u201cmonimial\u201d"

A simple sentence in the abstract, \"we modify an existing model to become interpretable, by using its predictions over a subset of features and then aggregating them\", will be useful to readers. \n\n- I have many questions about the SOP model since the writing is unclear. Listing them in the questions section.\n\n- While inspiring, the cosmology evaluation feels incomplete. Without a comparison control set (where cosmologists used LIME or some other method), it is not clear whether the benefits from SOP are unique. Also, there is a subtle problem in the conclusion of results: the results only show that _one_ predictive model tends to weigh voids higher than clusters. It does not say anything about the true process. It is possible that there is another model with same accuracy that weights voids and clusters differently. So I'm not sure what is the goal of the cosmology case study--is it to explain a ML model, or is it to understand the DGP/true model?"

Is the backbone model same as an existing model to be explained, or is it a new model? Is the SOP model trained end-to-end or only the backbone is trained and SOP weightes can be inferred?\n- Can you take a concrete example (e.g., ImageNet) and describe to readers how exactly you will create the SoP model? \n- Can you recreate Figure 5 using LIME or an existing feature attribution method on a standard non-SOP model? How different are the results?\n- Regarding Thm 1 and Thm 2, can you comment on counterfactual explanations? Since they are designed for deletion (but can also be defined for insertion), would they work better for Thm 1 and Thm 2? Would the feature attributions from CF explanations be better than other attributions?
