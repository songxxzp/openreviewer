This metric measures the risk-return tradeoff and efficiency of policy portfolios formed by an OPE estimator under varying online evaluation budgets (i.e. top-K policies selected by the estimator). Via examples, the paper demonstrates that existing metrics (MSE, regret@1, rank correlation) fail to differentiate policies with different risk-return tradeoffs while the proposed new metric does. The authors evaluated SharpeRatio@K via benchmark experiments using various existing OPE estimators regarding their risk-return tradeoff. The authors also developed open-source software for using the proposed metric."

Existing methods evaluate the superiority of an OPE estimator via various \u201caccuracy\u201d measures. However, the paper argues that merely looking at the accuracy may not be sufficient as two OPEs with similar accuracies may have different risk implications in practice. \n\nTo fix this issue, the paper proposes to use concepts from portfolio evaluation in finance and develops a new metric called SharpeRatio@k. This metric helps distinguish between conservative and high-stakes OPE estimators. The key idea behind this is to regard the set of top-k candidate policies selected by an OPE estimator as its \u201cpolicy portfolio\u201d. The paper constructs a policy portfolio that is \u201cefficient\u201d, i,e, it contains policies that improve the performance of behavior policy without including poorly performing policies. Finally, the paper evaluates typical OPE estimators using the proposed metric using a number of continuous control benchmarks."

Is this correct or am I missing something? \n\n\u2013 top-k policies are considered in several resource allocation setups where there are limited resources and some index is computed so that resource can be allocated to the top k indexes \n(For e.g. [1] \u201cRestless Bandits: Activity Allocation in Changing World\u201d, P Whittle; [2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02128). Can the method be using for designing robust top-k selection/resource allocation policies in this context?
