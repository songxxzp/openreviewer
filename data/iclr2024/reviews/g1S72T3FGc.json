                "value": "This paper builds on prior work by Wang et al., 2021 on neural active-learning with performance guarantees. As in that work, the authors construct two neural networks -- an exploitation network and an exploration network which is trained to fit the residuals (noise) of the exploitation network -- and sum their outputs to estimate the expected loss of each class given the context.\n\nOn the applied side, what makes this work different from Wang et al.'s is that the neural proposed in this paper jointly predicts the expected losses for all actions (classes) simultaneously. Whereas Wang et al. apply their neural networks to a context+action vector for each class individually. This makes inference K times faster for the authors' new method, where K is the number of classes. Additionally, the inputs to the neural network are K times shorter than in Wang et al. because they don't need to use a kronecker product construction to encode the chosen action (class) on the input side. And the smaller dimensionality also makes everything more efficient.\n\nThe authors then propose and analyze two algorithms for active learning which both utilize the signal & noise trained neural networks. The first algorithm is for the stream-based setting in which one example arrives at a time and the learner can either can either request a label or not, and there is a budget imposed on how many labels can be requested. The second algorithm applies to the pool-based setting where a set of examples is presented at each instance and the learner can request a label for one example in the set. For both settings the authors aim to minimize the population cumulative regret, which is the regret of the true / out-of-sample model performance of the learned model accumulated over the course of learning, minus the same for the Bayes optimal classifier.\n\nOn the theory side, the authors utilize the neural tangent kernel framework to derive lower and upper bounds on the cumulative population regret for two regimes of Mammen-Tsybakov noise: the hard margin regime and the unrestricted regime. The derived bounds improve those of Wang et al., 2021 by a factor of as much as O(md) where \"m\" is the network width and \"d\" is the input dimensionality. The authors also provide regret and label complexity bounds for the case where a unique Bayes optimal classifier exists. All bounds depend on a quantity related to the underlying dimension of the neural tangent kernel and another quantity related to the data.\n\nFinally, the authors present experiments comparing their active learning algorithms (NeurOnAL-S and NeurOnAL-P) for the stream and pool-based settings on several UCI datasets and FashionMNist against other neural active learning methods. The methods they compare against are: I-NeurAL (Wang et al., 2021), ALPS, BADGE, ALBL, CoreSet, DynamicAL. NeurOnAL-S/P generally outperform all others in terms of both test accuracy and running time, making for compelling empirical results."

But some discussion around how general the approach is would make this paper much less niche/narrow.\n\nA related weakness is that the bounds are in terms of quantities (S and L_H) that are difficult for practitioners to quantify or trade off in order to find the network architecture for their problem.\n\nIn the experiments, I did not see stated which subsets of data were used to tune hyperparameters. One might therefore worry that hyperparameters were tuned to give good test performance."

With pool based learning, one typically doesn't care about the performance of the intermediate models constructed during training, only the last model.\n\nI'm also curious about the use of the exploration and exploitation networks and why they are better able to model the signal and the noise. In particular, using the gradients of the exploitation network as inputs to the exploration network -- why does this work? Is there any theoretical explanation (not just intuition) that justifies how this helps fit the noise?\n\nFinally, I am trying to understand the statement in section 5 that\n\n          h(x_t)[k] = <Grad f(x_t, theta*)[k], theta* - theta1>.\n\nIs this an assumption or does such a theta* always exist? And if it always exists, is it the same theta* for all \"t\" and \"k\"?"
