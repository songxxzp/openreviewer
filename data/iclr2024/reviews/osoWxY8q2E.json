                "value": "This paper studies the sparsity properties associated with activation functions in Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights that LLMs employing ReLU-based activations exhibit pronounced sparsity in FFN, which can be harnessed for more efficient LLM inference. Conversely, modern LLMs commonly utilize activation functions such as GeLU and SiLU, which generate non-zero outputs even for negative inputs. This behavior hinders the model from achieving optimal sparsity. This paper proposes to replace GeLU, SiLU with ReLu for better sparsity. The paper studies both training the model from scratch and fine-tuning the model to make non-ReLU models adapt to ReLU activations. The authors suggest that replacing other activations with ReLU does not largely hurt the model performance. Finally, this paper also discusses the potential applications of this sparsity property."

Although I understand that zero-shot learning and ICL are common settings to compare LLM performance, it can be helpful to compare the model performance on generation tasks to better understand how different activations influence model performance.\n\n3. I am confused by the applications studied in Section 5.1, what does \u201cloading new weights\u201d mean here? Shouldn\u2019t all weights be pre-loaded to the GPU HBM in common inference frameworks like vLLM [3]? \n\n4. Although the paper claims that replacing other activations with ReLU only has negligible impacts on the performance, the accuracy drop seems not to be so marginal.

This paper argues that ReLU activation can match performance of non-ReLU while significantly reducing computation due to inducing sparsity. Experiments show training LLMs from scratch with different activations yields similar performance but ReLU is much more sparse. The paper proposes \"relufication\" - modifying pretrained non-ReLU LLMs by replacing activations with ReLU and re-finetuning. Relufied LLMs regain original performance quickly during finetuning while being 3x more sparse, reducing computation. Additional techniques like inserting ReLU after normalization layers further improve sparsity and efficiency. Analysis shows relufied ReLU LLMs reuse neurons across tokens, enabling optimizations like faster speculative decoding. Shifted ReLU aligned to preactivations can achieve even higher sparsity with minimal impact on performance. Overall, the paper advocates reinstating ReLU in LLMs for inferencing efficiency with manageable tradeoffs.\n\nAuthors also explore aggregated sparsity, which they defined as the ratio of neurons that have not been used up to processing the first t token. They show that models using RELU display up to 50% aggregated sparsity and the usage pattern is not random so only a subset of the model can be loaded up speculatively for some cases."
