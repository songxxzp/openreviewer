The overall pipeline, pseudo label mining, feature separation and score contrast module are very similar to LACP.  The technical contributions look like modifications to each LACP component from the engineering side. There should be more in-depth analysis to explain the motivation of each proposed design. \n- Experiments: \n  - Missing important benchmark results (ActivityNet) in the main paper.\n  - Missing important methods in comparison table (tab.4). Is there a reason to not compare with other point-level supervision methods (SF-Net, BackTAL and Ju et.al. ) method on ActivityNet?\n  - The performance on Activitynet against video-level supervision methods does not look competitve. If this is due to the sparsity of action in activitynet videos, then the authors should provide  comparison with video-level approaches on other benchmarks (GTEA and BEOID), as GTEA and BEOID has denser action distributions and should be better according to the authors' claim. \n- Generally, the paper suffers from bad writing, including grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, verb tense, etc), confusing wording, poor organization (introduction too long, and experiments too short), and inconsistent citation style (e.g. for pointTAD). The overall paper feels repetitive and lacks flow. The authors need to revise the whole paper thoroughly and properly organize the content in the main paper (eg. move important comparison results from supp. to main paper).\n- There's a factual error in Introduction, Related Work and Comparison table, that pointTAD is in fact not a weakly supervised approach to TAD, but a fully-supervised method."

Also, all formulas should end with a comma or period, and space after the bracket, etc.\n\n2. I think the experiment part could be revised to provide a clear comparison. First, in Table 1, the author could provide provides more recent fully supervised temporal action localization methods like ActionFormer, TriDet, etc. They can easily achieve around 66+ mean mAP@[0.3,0.7] on THUMOS14. Don't claim those state-of-the-art methods will make the result table not convincing. Also, Table 1 reports mean mAP@[0.1,0.5] and mean mAP@[0.3,0.7]. While in Table 2, the author only reports the mean mAP@[0.1,0.7]. It is confusing here. Also, Table 2 should become a step-to-step ablation, the current form is somehow weird."

The overall two-step framework strictly follows that of LACP (Lee & Byun, 2021), with improvements made to the original loss (i.e., Feature Separation loss), a correction to the overlapping issue between action instances during loss calculation (i.e., Score Contrast loss), and addition of new elements (i.e., Label Extension Module). While these contribute to the paper, from my view, this work seems an extension of the previous work (Lee & Byun, 2021), and the newly introduced contributions are slightly under the standard bar of top-tier conferences.\n- This paper lacks comprehensive analyses to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed components. As noted in the above weakness, the model improves the previous approach with modifications and additions. However, their actual effects and how they help are not analyzed in the experiments. Also, apple-to-apple comparisons with the original method would be desirable.\n- The paper is not self-contained in its current form, distracting the readers by making them alternate between the main paper and the appendix. Also, only the two kinds of experimental results are provided in the manuscript, while the remaining ones are in the appendix. It is strongly encouraged for the authors to trim the inappropriately long content in Introduction and Related work (e.g., Figure 1 occupies too much space), and add more experimental results in the main text.\n\n(Minor)\n\nThe reference format to PointTAD is wrong; it should be formatted as (Tan et al., 2022). Additionally, PointTAD is not a weakly-supervised approach, so the comparison with it in Table 1 is inappropriate."
