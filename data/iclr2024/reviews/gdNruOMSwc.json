By leveraging OpenAI's GPT models and prompt\nengineering, the system automatically revised the HTML code, resulting in a notable decrease of the accessibility\nviolation errors."

The\nevaluation, although not particularly extensive, is transparent and traceable. Since the authors have provided the dataset\nand the code, it should be possible to reproduce the results to a certain extent. To enable future comparisons with other\nmethods, the resulting dataset should be made publicly available.\nThe authors have cleverly used existing components, such as OpenAI's GPT model, and creatively combined them to\nsolve an essential and socially relevant problem.\nThe approach certainly has potential and quality, but the paper needs some revision, as it does not seem quite mature in\nits current form."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Although the introduction effectively underscores the importance of enhancing and automating accessibility, it could benefit from a more comprehensive integration within the landscape of the really closely related work. While the authors touch on recent automatic and semi-automatic approaches, they just mention that there have also been studies that considered improving accuracy through semi-automatic techniques of manual correction and even a few automating this correction using prompt engineering (most related), without providing specific examples or literature. If the deployment of prompt engineering is something completly new in this context, the authors must either point this out more clearly or highlight the differences and advantages of their approach compared to the existing state of the art.\nRegarding the cited related work, it should also be noted that the mentioned automatic strategies mainly cover the generation of alternative text for images and in this context the insufficient quality of the automatic alt-text approach of facebook is pointed out. This aligns with the statement on page 1, that the most common issue in accessibility is the lack of text equivalents or alternate text for images, but is also incidental after it becomes apparent (page 7) that images cannot be processed at all by the system presented by the authors.\n\nWith regard to the proposed method, it is difficult to tell which components were pre-existing and which were developed by the authors, making the contribution not directly apparent. The presented approach does not seem to involve any fundamentally novel non-basic components, but its strength lies in the adept engineering and smart combination of existing components. This has certainly its own value when it is shown that an existing problem can be solved in new ways. Hence this is not really the issue.\nHowever, my main criticism is that there is no quantitative or qualitative comparison with existing methods.\nAs much as I appreciate the research in this area and recognize the need for automated methods, there is unfortunately no substantial evidence presented that the authors' method is in any way at least equivalent to existing approaches, or even superior to them.\nThe authors should try to compare with existing approaches, as the mere improvement over the initial situation is arguably not so meaningful.\nThis would be different, if their method uniquely addresses unresolved accessibility issues and a comparison might not be feasible or possible. However, it appears that this is not the case, or at least it is not evident and must be clearly pointed out and proven by facts.\nThe same applies to the authors' claim within the conclusion section that they have invented a new subfield of automated accessibility.\n\nOther weaknesses:\n- I don't see the necessity of the mathematical formulas in section 3.4. The expressions appear to artificially introduce complexity, making it more unnecessary challenging for the reader to comprehend. Rather than introducing variables with no subsequent significance, it would be more effective to use an illustration of the pipeline or at least pseudo code. Especially since the definitions lack clarity and precision, for instance, the term \"sub\" was used without prior explanation, and both the definition and the necessity of F_{HTML\\_fix}'s definition remain incomprehensible, raising doubts that it is mathematically well-defined. Furthermore, most of the variables are unnecessary for defining the terms of R and I. A clear verbal introduction would have sufficed and enhanced comprehension.\n- Section 5 is not really a discussion, but a summary. There is no critical examination present.\n\nMinor weaknesses:\n- The title is misleading. \"Deep Learning\" refers solely to the use of pretrained LLMs and not to the direct embedding of deep learning techniques.\n- In table 2 the space is missing in some cells of \"final / avg\".\n- Typo in Figure 4: \"messasges\"\n- Page 2 and 3 contain faulty links to literature\n- The figures/tables should be referenced in the main text to put them in context and improve readability by guiding the reader. Also, the context of some tables, such as Table 3 , is not discussed or mentioned in any way, so it is not clear what the reader is supposed to do with this information."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Why is there no comparison to other existing methods?\n- Since missing alternate text for images is in general a key issue, how would approaches addressing alt-text, such as the\none of Facebook, perform on your data set? Even if the authors' method ignores images, this could help to assess the\noverall performance (assuming the URLs contain a realistic number of images).\n- How were the 25 URLs in the dataset selected? Which URLs were previously used by related work? Why weren't the\nsame ones used, or is there no information available?"
