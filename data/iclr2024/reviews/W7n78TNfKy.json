                "value": "The authors focus on the self-supervised skeleton action recognition and argue that existing methods overlook the 'high-order' temporal contents despite utilizing the spatial-temporal backbone. To remedy this issue, the Koopman Theory is introduced, which can map the complex nonlinear dynamics into linear evolutions by finite-dimensional approximation approach. Then, the 'cross-order' representation considering both dynamic equation and initial value is extracted by forcing the 'first-order'(plain features outputted by typical backbone networks) and 'high-order' feature vectors together. Experimental results adequately verify the effectiveness and robustness of KTCL as well as its components."

Undoubtedly, the application innovation accompanied by structural modifications should be encouraged, but the deeper and further improvements may be more attractive for publication. \nc) The reviewer is unsure whether the query/key mapping in Figure 2 will bring more training parameters and thus affect the fairness of the performances."

                "value": "Major:\n\n- Using the Koopman operator for the linearisation of non-linear dynamics systems has been explored for many years and not very new, and its application to skeleton-based action recognition is also not new. (i) The newest work, e.g., [A], uses the same idea for skeletal action recognition and further extended to one-shot learning as well. What are the novelties of the proposed model compared to the existing methods in the literature? (ii) It looks like an application of Koopman operator to solve time series / skeleton sequence classification problems.\n\n- Lack of enough literature review of related works that are closely related to the proposed model, for example, the existing methods for handling the temporal information, e.g., bilinear pooling, second-order pooling, covariance pooling, the use of Dynamic time warping, etc.\n\n- A research paper should focus on describing their own innovation. This paper has made a lot of introductions in the background, which are all published works. This is inappropriate. The author of the paper should compress the background content and save the space to describe the methods proposed. For example, Sec. 3.1 of the paper looks almost identical to the Sec. 3.1 of paper [A]! I know these are basics of Koopman theory, but where is your cutting-edge innovations?\n\n- The authors presented Fig. 1 & 2, but these two figures are not properly managed and unable to deliver the core innovations of the proposed method. For example, in Fig. 2, the embedding of features in the joint embedding space is not discussed clearly in either the figure caption or the texts. Figure 3 shows some nice visualisations; however, in Fig. 3(b), what does each different colour mean and how to know if the proposed model works better, and how to compare? At lease some t-SNEs for either baseline models or variants are required to ensure a comparison to support the claim made '... the model has learned discriminative features ...'.\n\n- It is suggested to have a notation section for the maths symbols used in the paper to make them clearer to readers. For example, regular fonts are scalars; vectors are denoted by lowercase boldface letters, matrices by the uppercase boldface, etc. (i) Eq. (1) What is F, Y and t? These concepts should be mentioned clearly to readers if you show them in the paper. (ii) What are the dimensions of  $x_i$ and $\\textbf{X}$?\n\n- Lack of experiments to show the effectiveness w.r.t. baselines etc: (i) Sec. 3.2, the authors mentioned that their method is built on the basic structure of MoCo, and they cite two works; however, these methods are not evaluated or compared in the paper as e.g., baselines, etc. Such comparisons are also important to show the effectiveness of the proposed model on top of existing models like MoCo. (ii) The authors also use the first-order feature representation combined with the high-order dynamics; however, there is no evidence to show the performance gain is from the high-order dynamics or the first-order representations from the base models, etc.\n\n- The reasons for the underperforming cases are not even mentioned in the paper, this is a noteworthy shortcoming. These cases should be discussed and analysed thoroughly, e.g., the method is based on HiCo (AAAI'23), but it achieves 74.5% on the X-Set of NTU-RGB+D 120, but your extension (with KTCL) of HiCo only achieves 74.1%, this is a performance drop that should be mentioned and discussed in the paper, as to readers, these are very important. Again, in Table 2, why existing method such as SkeAttnCLR (IJCAI'23) achieves 69.4% on the X-Sub of NTU-RGB+D 60, but the proposed KTCL only achieves 67.4%, any discussions why the performance drops ~ 2%?\n\n[A] Neural Koopman Pooling: Control-Inspired Temporal Dynamics Encoding for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition, CVPR'23\n\nMinor:\n\n- The authors say 'the similarity between the embeddings is measured as the dot product', is the features being normalised (e.g., cosine similarity) or the magnitudes of feature representations are considered as well?\n\n- How you obtain the skeleton sequence to form each T-frame? These information should be clear to readers, if similar to existing works, then related citations should be there clearly.\n\n- Eq. (12) $m_j$ is not explained, what is its relationship w.r.t. $m_j^d$, $m_j^t$, and $m_j^s$. A concatenation similar to the obtaining of \n$z$?"
