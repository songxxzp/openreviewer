Additionally, the paper provides comprehensive experimental evidence to establish the suitability of their approach for the problem."

Both solutions highlight that the authors intelligently use their task-specific insights.

The differentiating factor lies in RINGER's introduction of a unique relative positional encoding, specifically designed to account for cyclic symmetry. It's important to note that there appears to be a lack of an ablation study on this proposed positional encoding, which could provide valuable insights.\n2. Additionally, from a machine learning perspective, one may question the inherent challenges of conformation generation for macrocyclic peptides. It might be worthwhile to explore whether adapting methods from other molecule types is a feasible approach, as machine learning methods may not be strongly influenced by molecular variations.\n3. In the context of unconditional generation tasks, a comparison with other existing methods would be highly valuable in order to assess RINGER's performance and capabilities more comprehensively. Additionally, in the comparison of conditional generation, where rRMSD and rTFD metrics are employed, it appears that there is a absence of a method focused on backbone generation.\n\n[1] Wu K E, Yang K K, Berg R, et al.

How do you determine the 3 torsional angles and 2 bond angles for a macrocycle (how many atoms are in the cycle? How about a two-ring system?) The post-processing optimization step seems an effective and efficient solution to reconstruct the cartesian coordinates for the macrocycles, but how do you assemble them back into the structure (assuming you are only optimizing for the rings)?\n\nOverall, I think this is an interesting application paper to establish diffusion models to sample conformational changes for molecular structures, especially ring systems. Given it's an application paper, I would expect more discussions from the problem formulation side and why it should be designed in this way with more case studies to demonstrate, e.g. it could handle multiple ring systems.
