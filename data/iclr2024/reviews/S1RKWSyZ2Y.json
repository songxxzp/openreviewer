Authors put forward the hypothesis that natural text-based edit instructions, provided by humans, are oft terse and this hinders contemporary learning-based models from successfully capturing and dependably following intended image-edit meanings. \n\nThe crux of the proposed strategy involves learning to map terse input text, representing image edit-instructions, to more expressive (evidently more verbose) output text, in order to provide more explicit image-editing guidance. The work explores the efficacy of leveraging cross-modal capabilities, contemporary language-models, and sensitivity to visual inputs in order to positively influence edit-instruction quality. This multi-modal component is evidenced to be important for text-edit quality and resulting downstream edited images. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the proposed strategy, across various metrics and human rankings, are reported in comparison with recent work and a relevant baseline, across four benchmark datasets."

Explanation of the guided image editing strategy is aided by basic yet clear schematics to aid understanding (Fig. 2, specifically). \n\nThe investigation can be considered reasonably thorough with the inclusion of experimental work covering (i) method efficacy (quant. & qual.), (ii) vision & language hyper-parameter sensitivity, (iii) ablating instruction generation components, (iv) compute. Reported qualitative results are quite compelling and show some good perceptual improvements over baselines.

Good evidence is provided that the presented strategy goes some way to tackling the observed short-comings however technical contributions (size, sufficiency) can be regarded as moderate. The overarching system makes use of an array of pre-existing components however the particular implementation that facilitates component concatenations can be regarded as somewhat novel.\n\nFor this venue, an important factor that would strengthen the submission might look to provide additional understanding, discussion on the long-term sustainability of the proposed style of approach. The requirement for intermediary 'on-the-fly' remappings, reconfigurations of text input cannot be regarded as a very elegant or pleasing solution. I explicitly note that this is not grounds for rejection, my point is rather that further thinking, discussion on the fundamental gaps that prevent base models from correctly realising terse (yet human-parseable) instruction would likely prove elucidating and of high value. An empirical avenue here might involve investigating pre- and post-hoc parts-of-speech (POS) distributions, or other statistical evaluation of the edit-text distributions. Is the long-term goal, alternatively, to fashion single models, capable to understand natural (terse) human instruction? The point touches on well-understood (dis-)advantages of modular-component systems c.f. end-to-end.\n\nI would be keen for authors to discuss these points and I am open to modifying my score. \n\nMinor suggestions:\n\n1. Authors may wish to update to an ICLR24 template (c.f. ICLR23) \n\n2. On pp.2: suggest explicitly expand acronym 'IPr2Pr' on first use (presumably Instruction Prompt-2-Prompt ?)\n\n3. Precision of some phrasing could be tightened, towards aiding reading understanding. See example suggestions in following section. \n\n4. The (useful!) model schematic image, found between Figure 3 and Figure 4, is unnumbered. Is this by design ? Suggest 'Baselines' paragraph might serve as suitable caption content."

This will undoubtedly increase the value of the contributions. If impossible; web page might be extended to allow public inference-time testing.\n\n* The property of 'elaborate descriptions' is posed as something one wishes to evade in natural commands and yet 'explicit yet detailed guidance' is conversely noted a sought after notion. Do the authors suggest that the former pertains largely to image space, in a similar fashion to e.g. regional masks? Concrete examples of the considered 'elaborate descriptions' may help to clarify this point.\n\n* How is the phrase 'reasonable image editing' to be defined?\n\n* Minor: Small icons (flame, blue cube) tagged to components in the system schematic (Fig.2) presumably represent learnable and frozen model components, respectively.

Visual results look very promising, and suggest that the proposed changes can yield noticeable gains over instructpix2pix The evaluation is detailed and the method is analysed from a lot of different angles.\n\nThe idea of replacing the CLIP encoder with a more expressive vision-language model is sound, as providing more detailed instructions can help guide the diffusion model towards the desired output. Authors have made efforts to go beyond simple replacement of the text encoder and added functionality (summarization, adaptation to visual content) that improve performance."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My main concern with this work is the limited novelty. The crux of the innovation is the use of a multimodal language model instead of a CLIP model in the instructpix2pix setting. The second main innovation is the introduction of [IMG] tokens, which are processed by a transformer head to generate conditioning embedding for a LDM model. This approach is very strongly inspired from Koh et al. 2023, where they train a language model to generate image tokens, which are then transformed via a transformer architecture, and used as conditioning for stable diffusion based generation. The source of inspiration should be credited more clearly (the main reference in the method section simply mentions using a similar feature extractor architecture).\n\nThe presentation of the paper could be improved as well.  The paper is written in a confusing way, and lacks explanation and justifications for design decisions. For example, equation (5) is introduced without any justifications or intuitive explanation, and author do  not explain what they refer to as by score. Similarly, what authors refer to as MLLMs (pre-trained LLMs adapted to take visual inputs as well) is not clearly defined until section 3.1. Multimodal language models can be designed and trained in different ways (e.g. trained with vision-text inputs jointly), and authors should clarify that they refer to a specific type of models. Similarity, the edit head T was not clearly explained, I needed to read the GILL paper (Koh et al.) to understand how these features were generated. Another example is figure 2, which is mentioned at the beginning of chapter 3.2 and shows a MLLM* model without explanation, while this model is only introduced (in a footnote) in a later paragraph. \n\nWhile the evaluation is detailed with experiments carried out on many datasets, state of the art references are limited. The only pre-existing work that authors compare to is instructpix2pix, while the LGIE baseline is an overly poor baseline, which is expected to perform worse than any model with vision-language mappings (e.g. CLIP) in a lot of settings. It does not make a lot of sense to ask a pure language model to hallucinate detailed descriptions of an unseen image. Evaluations on prompt-based editing methods are available on the magic brush dataset, and could provide additional context. For consistency, instructions could easily be converted to a prompt using an LLM."

Results in tables 1-2 compared to results reported in Zhang et al (MagicBrush) show that there can be a noticeable difference for some metrics (e.g. 70->74 for DINO score on instructpix2pix). Several of these evaluations show performance scores that are relatively close, have authors investigated how consistent these rankings are across multiple seeds? \n\n- Are ground truth images (post edit) available for all datasets? Why were these specific sets of evaluation metric chosen? Why not e.g. measure image quality using FID?\n\n- Authors compare inference times, but do not mention training times. How much more more expensive is it to train this new model compared to pix2pix? This is relevant as noticeable performance gains can be observed when fine-tuning on a specific instruction/edit types."
