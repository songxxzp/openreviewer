Finally, the experimental results on two multi-agent benchmarks showcase the superiority of the proposed method across cooperative and competitive games."

The main components of this paper are two loss functions: consistent loss and discriminative loss. These two losses cluster the embeddings of the same policy and separate the embeddings of different policies. If the embeddings are learned only through these two losses, only 'agent IDs' are encoded in the embeddings.  What if one agent chooses different policies or stochastic policies? What if different agents adopt the same policies? More seriously, it seems that the embeddings are the representations of policies, rather than states. If so, why is hyperbolic space needed? What are the hierarchical structures of agent representations?\n3. The empirical results are not significant enough. There is only a slight improvement over baselines in Figure 5. The results in Figure 8 cannot strongly support the effectiveness of the proposed two objectives also due to the minor improvement.\n4. This paper did not provide any discussions of limitations."

                "value": "1. I did not understand the statement in the Introduction that \"... policy representations in MARL are crucial to realize cooperation among agents, improve the performance and efficiency...\". My difficulty in understanding is this - policy representations need to be shared between the agents in order to achieve some of these benefits. But if this is done, then the information structure of the game is changed and potentially the equilibria as well. One can then ask the question - if additional information were to be shared between the agents to facilitate cooperation, will policy representations be the best information? Can the authors please clarify this?\n2. Does the tree architecture described for trajectories for MDPs extend in a straightforward way to multi-agent systems with different information structures. Is it assumed that each agent sees a different tree from its own perspective?\n3. I believe in equation (1), it is assumed that the policy is dependent only on the state (as this is sufficient for optimality in MDPs). But this is not the case in games. In addition to policies being history-dependent, games also have other considerations such as definition of the specific refinement of Nash equilibrium or team optimality as the solution concept. Hence, I do not think the formulation given in (1) seamlessly extends to multi-agent scenarios. Can the authors please clarify this?\n4. Throughout the paper trajectories are assumed to be sequences of state-action pairs. However, this is not the case in games, where each agent has a different observation and hence different trajectory. Also, what is the structural assumption made about the policies used by the agents? This is not obvious, as in games, Markovian policies need not be optimal for any agent.\n5. I am not aware of hyperbolic neural networks and hence my understanding is limited. Is the entire trajectory sequence used to predict the next element in a hyperbolic neural network (like an RNN) or just the current trajectory element is used to predict the next one? Or is there no such sequence prediction task defined here and the hyperbolic network is trained purely using the losses defined in equations (11) and (12)?\n6. In equation (7) what are the state, action and observation spaces? Are the observations and actions for each agent assumed to lie in a Euclidean space? What about discrete categorical action spaces? Can they also be incorporated in this framework?\n7. If two agents in a game follow identical policies, will they represented by the same point in the Poincare ball? If so, how?\n8. I did not understand the first line in Section 3.3. Can the authors please explain?\n9. Does the discriminative loss function in equation (12) also minimize the distance between the representations of two different policies from two different agents? Then, how does the contrastive learning work? Should there be a negative sign in equation (13) corresponding to this loss?\n10. Can the authors explain how the learnt policy representations are used in MARL by the different agents?"
