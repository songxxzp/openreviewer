Although I understand the authors may want to have a focus contribution to this specialized direction (a.k.a, conversation), the difference with other work is not that clear. For example, a lot of work recently tried to evaluate the tool-using ability to solve real-world tasks. See [1] for an example. In this case, real-world tasks can always happen during the conversation. \n\n2. The evaluation is too limited. This is a fundamental drawback for this kind of benchmark paper. Basically, only two models, namely GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, are considered in the experiments.  It would be more interesting to see the results of some open-sourced models, like Vicuna, and Alpaca. \n\n3. The overall presentation needs to be improved. For example, the two algorithm blocks in Page-5 do not provide too much useful information.\n\n\n[1] MINT: Evaluating LLMs in Multi-Turn Interaction with Tools and Language Feedback.

After the tools/plugins have been defined, (i) GPT4 is used to create complex scenarios requiring tool usage, (ii) humans (authors?) create tool-using conversations from these scenarios. Each turn in a multi-turn dialog consists of (i) user utterance, (ii) tool calls made by assistant, (iii) expected return values for tools, (iv) ground-truth assistant response. There are 50 conversations created with GPT4 scenarios (3 tool calls each), and 28 created by humans (one tool call).\n\nThe evaluation on ToolTalk is done in two phases: (1) Given a dialog ending in a user utterance, with all prior tool calls/responses, the model either (i) generates a response, or (ii) generates tool calls, which are executed until the model generates a response. (2) The predicted tool calls for a given context are compared against ground-truth tool calls. To measure the correctness of a tool call, either the arguments are compared for equality with the ground-truth (for action tools) or the results of the execution (e.g., search) are compared for equality (for non-action tools). This enables (1) precision of tool calls, (2) recall of tool calls and (3) success rate of tool calls (all tool calls correct, and no incorrect actions) and (4) incorrect action rate (wrong action tool is successfully called). \n\nGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are evaluated on ToolTalk, both with and without tool documentation. Three major reasons that models fail are: (i) premature tool calls, (ii) faulty reasoning and (iii) incorrect invocation of correct tool. For both with and without documentation, the rate of each error type is presented. The models without documentation perform worse."

Additional examples would help\n\n- Will the proposed methodology generalize to a tool such a search engine or general-purpose retrieval? I imagine the tool correctness metric would need to change.\n\n- The evaluation of GPT4/GPT3.5 does not provide much value, except to show that the benchmark is challenging and that tool documentation is important.

Given that there are so much analyses done in the paper, it is concerning on it use as a good test set for conversational setting. Furthermore, it would be great to provide more details of the dataset after the filtering. How many turns in the conversations? How many average number of tools used and evaluated? etc. (b) GPT 3.5 and GPT 4: The only two models used for this work. It is important to know how other models such as Llama or Llama chat or Code Llama perform on this task. I do get the fact that GPT 4 would be the best in the performance but a comprehensive overview is important.
