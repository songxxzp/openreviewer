Specifically, different upper bounds for both source and target-domain generalization errors are presented, revealing the key information quantities that control the capability of learning algorithms to generalize on unseen domains. Motivated by the theoretical analysis, this paper proposes the Inter-domain Distribution Matching (IDM) algorithm for high-probability DG by simultaneously aligning inter-domain gradients and representations, and Per-sample Distribution Matching (PDM) for high-dimensional and complex data distribution alignment. Experimental results are provided to validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm."

                "value": "1. From the definitions of L_tr and L_te, this paper assumes that we have an infinite number of samples for each domain so that we can evaluate the population risk of each domain. This means that only the generalization gap caused by finite number of domains is considered, but the generalization gap due to finite number of samples is ignored. It is fine to only focus on the gap between L_tr and L_te, but it should be mentioned that in practice we also need to deal with the standard generalization error gap, which cannot be handled by the method proposed in the paper.\n\n2. It seems that the assumption in Theorem 7 seldom holds in practice. Note that R is a representation of X, so for any fixed d, $I(Y;X|D=d)\\ge I(Y;R|D=d)$ by data processing inequality. Take expectation over D, we have $I(Y;X|D)\\ge I(Y;R|D)$, and therefore $H(Y|X,D)\\le H(Y|R,D)$. \nIn the discussion after Theorem 7, it is said that \u201c$I(Y;D|R)$ is hard to estimate, and minimizing the covariate shift $I(R;D)$ solely is sufficient.\u201d Note that $I(Y;D|X)$ is not a lower bound for $I(Y;D|R)$ in general. Why does the proposed algorithm only minimize $I(R_i;D_i)$?  From my understanding, we should minimize $I(Y;D|R)$ together with $I(R;D)$, which corresponds to the invariant risk minimization or sufficiency condition in fairness literature."

However, on the other hand, I think it probably is because the authors used the average of accuracies from multiple cases with different combinations of training/testing domains. If we look into more details, e.g., relative improvement compared to the ERM, or the worst case, we might be able to observe more apparent differences. For example, for the PACS dataset, P and A as testing domains are easier (higher accuracies), while C and S as testing domains are relatively more difficult (lower accuracies). Improvement of e.g., 2%p from P as testing and S as testing should be treated differently. But by averaging, one is ignoring such differences. \n- For a similar reason, not sure if the average across different datasets makes sense.\n- It seems like finding a decent model selection strategy for the IDM is left as a future study. Do the authors have any rough ideas on that?\n- Plans to share the codes to reproduce all the results?"

First, the authors prove information-theoretic bounds on the generalization error using the mutual information between domain index and inputs (Theorem 5). They also give bounds in terms of the mutual information between domain index and the classifier learned by the algorithm (Theorem 3). Second, an algorithm is proposed as a new method for domain generalization. The algorithm simultaneously matches the distributions of conditional representations and the distributions of gradients (with respect to the classifier head only). In contrast to previous works that does domain matching, the new algorithm matches at each dimension, e.g. sorts the examples along each dimension and try to match the conditional distribution. Third, experiments are performed on ColoredMNIST and DomainNet. This algorithm achieves good performance when selecting hyper-parameters based on the test domain validation set (using test domain labels), but average when selecting hyper-parameters based on training domain validation set."

The fact that I(W, D) and I(Z, D) appear in a generalization bound doesn't give direct justification for gradient space or representation space distribution matching. For example, Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) would be minimizing I(W, D) more directly. The distinction of encoder vs classifier is quite arbitrary for deep neural networks, and I(Z,D) to me seems like a lower bound that says no domain generalization algorithm can do better than I(Z,D) than justifying a representation matching algorithm. The main reason that the authors picked the specific form of algorithms in this paper is perhaps they found superior empirical performance, which leads to the next problem.\n2. On the empirical results, the proposed algorithm is a combination of existing gradient-matching algorithm and a somewhat new representation matching algorithm. There's some innovation in the latter part, where the per-dimension sorting and matching is more fine-grained, but the general idea is not new. When we look at empirical performance, the paper shows that this new combination achieves better average OOD accuracy only when tuning hyperparameters on test domains, which many previous papers have argued against [Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz, In Search of Lost Domain generalization]. When selecting on training domains, the method doesn't outperform baselines. The authors made a strong argument in the appendix for their model selection method. I don't have a fundamental objection to the argument, but I think the fact that the proposed algorithm has more hyperparameters than many baselines mean that it has an unfair disadvantage when tuned on test domains.\n3. Overall I think the novelty in algorithm and theory is lacking, and the empirical performance are not much better."

I think ColoredMNIST is quite contrived and we should show more ablations on realistic datasets."
