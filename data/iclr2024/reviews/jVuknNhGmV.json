This isn\u2019t true. For example, RKHS methods have been proposed that allow the space of Y to be quite general and for the space of A to be continuous.

The causal estimates discussed in prior literature often consider the outcomes for each unit to be represented as scalar or vector values. However, for many practical settings, these responses can be distributions. These distributions are a specialized case of functional outcomes and are closely associated with the field of functional data analysis (FDA). While recent works have attempted to study the causal impact of treatments on functional outcomes, they often operate within spaces that might compromise the inherent random structure of the distributional outcome. Building upon previous research, this paper introduces a new non-parametric framework and three distinct cross-fitted estimators for inferring causal effects when the treatment variable assumes continuous values. The study delves into the asymptotic properties of these estimators, providing crucial insights into their statistical performance and reliability. Additionally, empirical validation through two experiments corroborates the proposed estimator's consistency with theoretical findings, marking the threefold contributions of this research."

This setting is different from traditional treatment effect estimation, where the main estimand is a scalar/vector (ATE) or conditional expectation of a scalar/vector random variable (CATE). In this paper, on the other hand, the authors consider potential outcomes to be distributions or elements of the Wasserstein space of distributions, and, thus, the main estimand is taken as averaged potential Wasserstein barycentre, namely a causal map. The estimation theory for this estimand is then developed based on the adapted potential outcomes framework. The theory introduces three estimators, I.e., inverse-propensity weighted (IPW) estimator, direct regression  (DR) estimator, and double machine learning (DML) estimator. Then, it was shown, that combined with the cross-fitting procedure, those estimators are consistent under mild conditions. Additionally, the estimators are asymptotically normal, and the  DML estimator possesses a double-robustness property. The authors verify their theoretical results with a synthetic benchmark and a real-world case study."

                "value": "I have three main concerns regarding the paper: \n1. From a practical point of view in my opinion, there are no distinctions between two estimands, namely, the newly introduced \u201ccausal map\u201d and a simple \u201cdistribution of the potential outcomes\u201d. That is, in the context of the decision-making from observational data they both would have the same semantic meaning. Also, in the majority of the real-world applications, we could not distinguish between both, as we only have access to the samples, drawn from the distributions, but not the distributions themselves for each unit of measurement. Therefore, I wonder, why couldn\u2019t we just convert the problem into the estimation of the density of the potential outcomes, e.g., [1]? Therein, each unit of observation actually yields several observations, which are simply organized in one long-format table.   \n2. Another issue with the proposed setting is that it can be seen as treatment effect estimation over time with a single-time intervention. Merely all the motivational examples in the paper described datasets, where for each unit of measurement we observed time-series data, i.e., non-i.i.d. data. Then, by inferring the distributions for each unit we drop the time ordering information, which is an obvious loss of information. I encourage authors to add a discussion on this issue.  \n3.  A lot of details on the implementation are missing in Sec. 6 or Appendix. For example, it is unclear, how the functional regression is implemented, so that one can ensure that the estimated function is a CDF. Also, no details on the hyperparameters search or the confidence intervals estimation are given. Another issue with the experiments is that the synthetic dataset generator (Eq. 14a) seems to yield values of CDFs, which are larger than 1 or smaller than 0, which is not possible by the definition.\n\nAlso, there are some minor points:\n- Some related works are missing. For example, the approach of smoothing the Dirac delta function with kernels for IPW or DML estimators was employed in [2]. Also, the whole body of work on estimating distributions of potential outcomes is missing, e.g., [1, 3-5].\n-  The presentation of the results in Table 1 can be enhanced. E.g., now it looks like Dist-DR-MAE or Dist-DML-MAE are distinct methods.\n\nI am eager to increase my score if the authors address the above-mentioned issues.\n\n\nReferences:\n[1] Kennedy, E.
