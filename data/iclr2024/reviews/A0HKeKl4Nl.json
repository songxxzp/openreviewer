The authors address the critical problem of understanding how fine-tuning impacts models, and specifically try to offer mechanistic insight via a compelling section of techniques (probing, pruning, reverse fine-tuning).\n2. I like the TinyStories experiment, where the authors find that the pretraining capability can be recovered via fine-tuning uniquely when the learning rate is small enough, as evidenced by the control model. Importantly, I find it really interesting how in the high learning rate deletion setting, the capability loss for fine-tuning the control and deleted model match each other. I best understood this from Figure 79 on page 53 in the Appendix, which might benefit from being in the main paper. \n3. The authors are incredibly comprehensive over hyperparameters, giving many alternatives in the appendix."

                "value": "My overall analysis is that the authors haven't provided a clear definition of what it means for a capability to have been lost or recoverable\n\n1. [Experiment 2] I believe the wrapper formalization is inconsistently used throughout the paper. Starting at Definition 2, a wrapper $g$ is composed with $\\mathcal{C}$ and is defined as a map acting on the output of a capability ($g$ is unquantified here, and I believe the range should be the domain here). This definition is independent of a model and how it is parameterized. However, in the experiments, the wrapper definition is always a subset of the weights to be pruned. I believe this is not captured as a function of the capability/model output, but rather the function parameterization. As such, probing can not be used as evidence that the model learns a wrapper over the capability. \n    - This is not simply fixed by altering the definition to be a change over weights; there is always the wrapper of adding the optimal FT weights and subtracting the current PT weights, which would produce a strongly relevant capability but (I think) would go against the spirit of a wrapper. I believe it is non-trivial to find a definition of wrapper that is 1) covered by pruning and 2) captures the spirit of being a lightweight modification of the model. \n    - Is there an example of a fine-tuning capability that can not be obtained by a wrapper under the current or a revised definition? Having this delineation is important to proving something that isn't true by construction.\n\n2. [Experiment 3] In the abstract and introduction, revival via reverse fine-tuning is discussed as being sample-efficient. Experiment 3 is intended to demonstrate this phenomenon experimentally. However, there is no discussion of sample efficiency here or later in the paper. Specifically, to show that the pretrained capability is actually forgotten, there would need to be a comparison to how much time it takes to learn the pretrained capability, which doesn't exist since the capabilities are directly compiled via Tracr. Even this experiment would be confounded by the fact that the fine-tuned model can be seen as simply a good initialization for learning the pretrained capability from scratch. This sample efficiency analysis is critical since in theory, any capability can be learnt by training for long enough.\n\n3. [Experiment 4] The linked Figure 8 for the probing analysis does not concern probing. Does this mean to refer to Figure 5? If so, what new information does this section provide that is not captured in Experiment 2, which refers to Figure 5? The analysis and takeaway in this section do not seem grounded in data in the current state.\n\n4. I found the results in this paper quite difficult to parse. None of these items individually changed my score, but it did make it much harder/time-consuming to parse the message of the results.\n    - In Figure 4, (i) through (iv) do not agree on the figure vs the text.\n    - Figure 5 does not have a legend and I do not know what it is measuring.\n    - Figure 6 does not have an x-axis and I do not know what it is measuring.\n    - The plots are out of order, for example, Fig 7 is referenced before Fig 5. This led to some confusion while reading experiments.\n    - Plots such as Figures 6, 7, and 8 test for three controlled variables at once and take a lot of effort to parse.\n    - Is there a reason the chosen $P(O_{PT})$ is changed from Figure 7b to Figure 8b?\n    - The reader is required to parse and remember a lot of notation consistently across the paper. It would be helpful to be more verbose about the notation definitions, especially in plot titles and captions."

That being said, there is frankly not much to be learned about finetuning from this work. Yes, small finetuning rate would only change the model a little. Yes, the change would be potentially reverted if training on the original pretraining task. Yes, a larger finetuning rate would cause collateral damage, causing existing capabilities to be lost. These are all well-established knowledge about finetuning where plenty of papers have explored. Again, this is not to discredit this entire work. The authors should consider highlighting the newer findings that readers may not already know, perhaps how the distinction between strong and weak relevance would benefit the finetuning of a new capability.\n\nThe authors motivate the importance of understanding of the finetuning process by mentioning safety and jailbreaking attacks in the introduction and conclusion. Unfortunately no related experiments are shown.\n\nLast but not least, the authors should include a paragraph in related works discussing on how semi-controllable language models (e.g. transformers training on PCFG and Tracr) have been utilized in model interpretability previously, to help contexualize the usage of mechanistic interpretability techniques (e.g. weight pruning). The authors should also include the baseline of finetuning with a portion of pretrained data mix in, since that would be the most common finetuning technique. Conclusions drawn on such finetuned procedures would be more applicable, compared to purely finetuning on the new domain."
