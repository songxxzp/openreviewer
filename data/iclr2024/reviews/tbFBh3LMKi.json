Specifically, this paper proposes Uni-O4, which utilizes an on-policy RL objective for both offline and online learning. For offline learning, this paper combines the advantages of both BPPO and OPE to achieve the desired performance. For online learning, this paper directly utilizes the standard PPO for finetuning. Experiments under offline RL and offline-to-online RL setting demonstrate the effectiveness of Uni-O4. Furthermore, this paper extends the offline-to-online setting to address a practical robotic scenario, transforming it into an online-to-offline-to-online setting. Empirical results highlight the seamless integration across these three stages in Uni-O4."

                "value": "Overall, this is a descent paper. However, in the current manuscript, I think the following concerns should be addressed.\n\n== Major concern ==\n\n- Unclear empirical motivation in Figure 1. What does these variants (Conservatism, Constraint, Off-policy) mean in (a)? How does Q value compare with V value in (b)? Moreover, from (b), it seems that CQL->SAC shows faster improvement that On-policy (V). How this conclude that Q values of SAC exhibit slow improvement? Furthermore, CQL->CQL and CQL->SAC are na\u00efve solutions for offline-to-online RL. What about advanced offline-to-online RL algorithms, such as off2on?\n- The technique seems incremental by just combining BPPO with OPE.\n- I think there exhibits slight overclaiming of the experimental results in Introduction without sufficient comparison of SOTA algorithms.\n> Experimental results show that Uni-O4 outperforms both SOTA offline and offline-to-online RL algorithms.\n    - Insufficient comparison of offline RL, including but not limited to:\n\n    [1] RORL: Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning via Conservative Smoothing.\n\n    [2] Extreme Q-Learning: MaxEnt RL Without Entropy.\n\n    [3] Offline RL with No OOD Actions: In-Sample Learning via Implicit Value Regularization.\n\n    - Insufficient comparison (including PROTO, ODT, E2O, SPOT, etc.) or at least discussion of related works on offline-to-online RL. Particularly, the baselines include AWAC, CQL, IQL, which are naive solutions for offline-to-online RL. PEX presents weak sample-efficiency for above-medium datasets. Cal-ql is not empirically designed for MuJoCo tasks. There is only one relatively strong baseline, i.e., off2on.\n\n    [1] Adaptive policy learning for offline-to-online reinforcement learning\n\n    [2] Actor-Critic Alignment for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning\n\n    [3] A Simple Unified Uncertainty-Guided Framework for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning\n\n    [4] Efficient online reinforcement learning with offline data\n\n- Minor improvement on MuJoCo tasks in Figure 4. As shown in the figure, off2on significantly outperforms Uni-O4 by a large margin in halfcheetah-medium and halfcheetah-medium-replay. Besides, I also want to point out that 100 D4RL score already achieves expert-level performance in D4RL benchmark. Thus, further improvement on other settings over 100 is not necessary. Thus, I also wonder why this work does not consider random dataset, which presents a significant challenge for online finetuning to achieve expert performance.\n\n- Comparison in Section 5.2 seems not fair enough. Firstly, I want to know which is the claimed baseline WTW in Figure 5? Additionally, given that IQL is not designed specifically for a real-world robotic scenarios, is the comparison between IQL and Uni-O4 fair? (Uni-O4 is revised to adapt to robotic scenarios as stated in the appendix) Maybe a strong baseline can be considered to verify the superiority of Uni-O4.\n\n- I feel a little struggling to follow Section 5.2. Maybe a pseudo-code like A.6 can be provided to make the readers understand the online-offline-online setting more clearly.\n\n- The experimental results in A.3 make me confusing. I cannot identify obvious differences between Figure 11 (a) and (b).\n\n== Minor Concerns ==\n\n- Figure 2 is not that intuitive. Maybe more explanations can make it clearer.\n\n- How many seeds and evaluation trajectories for AntMaze tasks in offline RL setting? Why offline-to-online RL setting does not consider Kitchen, AntMaze and Adroit-cloned and -relocate tasks?\n\n- Why 18 hours training time is **unacceptable** for real-world robot learning?\n\n- Lack of reproducibility statement.\n\n- Maybe more details on baseline implementation for real-world robot tasks can be provided.\n\n- Why this paper does not provide offline training time for comparison?\n\n== Typos ==\n\n- Page 4, above Equation 7: dataset $D$ -> $\\mathcal{D}$\n\n- Page 9, Hyper-parameter analysis, loss 7 -> Equation 7 is an optimization objective."
