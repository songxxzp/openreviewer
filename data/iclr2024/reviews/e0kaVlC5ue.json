The authors then show that NNs can approximate eigenvectors, up to rotation.

However, I believe there are several ways in which this paper could be made stronger:\n\n1. Q1 is motivated as being of practical importance - how many neurons are needed to achieve an accuracy of X%. While the theoretical results provide this, they are difficult to parse into practical considerations. It would be helpful to have predictions of the theory on how many neurons are needed (and how many layers) for a given accuracy plotted (for at least some choice of parameters described in Theorem 2.1). A comparison with an actual implementation of SNN would make the theoretical results especially convincing (if they match up). \n\n2. Q1, as phrased in the Introduction, suggests that it is unknown whether it is \"possible to approximate eigenvectors of large adjacency matrices with a neural network\". However, as noted by the authors, there has been work showing success in this direction already. Perhaps it would be better to phrase Q1 as \"are there theoretical guarantees that a neural network can approximate the eigenvectors of large adjacency matrices\". \n\n3. Sec. 2.2 is said to be aimed at \"constructive ways to approximate $\\textbf{Y}^*$, but it is unclear how Theorem 2.2 achieves this. There is not mention of optimization in the theorem, and the number of neurons is set to $N = \\infty$. While I understand that the number of neurons can be reduced (in Remark 2.3), this mismatch between aim and result disrupted the flow of the paper. \n\n4. The figures (Fig. 3-5) were mentioned only briefly in the introduction (before many of the details of the paper were introduced and I was under the impression that they would be referenced later in more detail. As it stands, I did not get anything from the figures. Including them later in the text, as the experiments are motivated (e.g., why it is reasonable to consider \"Near optimal\", \"Large gradient\", and \"Near saddle\") would greatly improve their impact. \n\n5. I did not understand what was meant in the Introduction by the \"spectral contrastive loss function $\\mathcal{l}$ is non-convex in the 'ambient' space' \" until the discussion about the need for the quotient geometry in Sec 3. I think making this point more clear earlier in the paper would help the reader understand why this is an interesting and tricky problem."

Not covering data-dependent kernels as those in HaoChen and most SSL work also reduce the significance of the result.\n\n* The proof of the approximation result (Theorem 2.1) is quite straightforward, combining (known) ReLU network approximation results (Chen et al., 2022) with a Lipschizness-like condition for eigenvectors on manifolds (Calder et al., 2022).  It is not clear whether or not the proof could be useful for future theoretical work in this space. \n\n* The presentation of Theorem 2.2 and its proof needs clarification, e.g., I found the paragraph following Corollary 5 difficult to understand: \"Using the fact that bar{U} is invertible, we can easily see that Y_\\theta* ....\". Can you clarify how to get this result? I assume Y_\\theta* is the Y recovered by the optimal neural network that minimizes the spectral contrastive loss. I also find it difficult to see the reasoning behind Remark G.1-G.3 and how they fit into the proof.\n\n* The exposition of the main theorems can be improved. The neural network family constants are never defined in the main text and it makes Theorem 2.1 very hard to read. I strongly encourage the authors to provide intuitive explanations before/after each theorem to aid the understanding of assumptions used, proof ideas, and implications of the result."

Hence, (C1) should be a natural result. Moreover, most of the techniques seem not new and appeared in prior works, e.g., (Chen et al. 2022). \n\nGiven (C1), the second main claim (C2), e.g., Theorem 2.2, should be quite obvious. (C2) does not discuss the solvability of the optimization problem, i.e., how to find the global minima. Hence, I don\u2019t see a \u201cconstructive way\u201d to find the approximation. To me, this part (C2) is more like a result of the existence of such a neural network, which highly overlaps with the claim in (C1). \n\nWhen analyzing the loss landscape, in Section 3, the paper does not consider the loss function as a function of the network parameters. However, it considers it as a function of the network output. More explicitly, it is basically analyzing $\\|YY^T-A_n\\|^2_F$ as a function of $Y$, not of $\\theta$. First of all, this \u201clandscape\u201d is not the optimization landscape we are mostly interested in. One has to compose it with the network function $Y(\\theta)$ to have the full optimization loss. As we know, the hard part is the network function $Y(\\theta)$. Second, given the simple and symmetrical form of $\\|YY^T-A_n\\|^2_F$, the results presented in Section 3 are not hard to obtain. \n\nThe presentation of the paper can be improved. For example, I had a hard time understanding the notations in the theorems. For example in Theorem 2.1 it is not clear what is $\\epsilon$ and $m$. In Eq.(1.2),  $\\epsilon$ is used for the \u201cbandwidth\u201d for similarity, however, in the proof of Theorems, $\\epsilon$ seems an arbitrarily small positive number.

SNN is a neural network that is optimized by this objective, where the neural network outputs parameterize the eigenvectors. \nThe difficulty in the analysis of the SNN mainly comes from the fact that the ambient optimization problem (i.e., when the optimization is done in the nonparametric way without neural network parameterization) is non-convex.\n\nThe paper's contribution is threefold. First, the authors prove that there exists a MLP that can well-approximate the top-$r$ eigen-subspace, with sufficiently large number of neurons, under the manifold assumption (Theorem 2.1). \nSecond, it is shown that, under the same assumption, if the MLP architecture used in the optimization is sufficiently large, then the global optimizer attained by the architecture closely captures the top-$r$ eigenbasis up to a rotation (Theorem 2.2). Roughly speaking, a good MLP can be \"constructed\" by optimizing the SNN objective. \nLastly, the authors analyze the optimization landscape of the \"ambient\" problem, by examining three different regimes (Theorem 3.1-3.4).\n\nThe first two theorems constitutes an approximation theory of neural networks for the graph Laplacian matrix. Theorem 2.1 is a general approximation theory, while Theorem 2.2 is a result that specifically applies to the SNN objective. \nThe results in Section 3 solely cares about the ambient optimization problem being independent of a neural network parametrization, but these results are applicable for any PD matrix with a positive eigengap."

                "value": "The paper is a theoretical study of Spectral Neural Networks (SNNs). The problem considered in the paper consists in efficiently approximating an adjacency matrix by a product $\\mathbf Y\\mathbf Y^{\\mathrm T}$. The first main result (Theorem 2.1) gives a bound on the complexity of a neural network that provides an approximate solution of this problem. The second result (Theorem 2.2) shows that a solution provided by the network is close to a global minimizer, up to a rotation. The remaining results (Theorems 3.1-3.4) study the structure of the loss surface by dividing it into several regions with particular properties. The first region is a neighborhood of the optimal solution and the loss is geodesically strongly convex there (Theorems 3.1). Another region is the neighborhood of suboptimal stationary points. These points are described in Theorem 3.2, and Theorem 3.3 shows that near these points there are escape directions so that gradient flow is not trapped. Finally, Theorem 3.4 shows that in the remaining regions the gradient is large. Combined, these results suggest that the considered optimization problem can be efficiently solved by gradient descent."

My impression is that the present paper does not bring any fundamentally new ideas compared to previous publications. In particular, the main message expressed in it is that the considered optimization is practically feasible and the loss landscape is benign despite the non-convexity. The same message is found in Luo & Garc\u00b4\u0131a Trillos, 2022 in a similar wording. Moreover, the theorems found in section 3 of the present paper are extremely similar to the theorems in Luo & Garc\u00b4\u0131a Trillos, 2022. The present paper indicates some differences with that earlier paper (e.g., in Remark 3.2), but they are not clearly explained and seem to be rather technical. The paper Luo & Garc\u00b4\u0131a Trillos, 2022 is referred to multiple times in the present paper, but is not mentioned among the related works, which is confusing.  \n\n**Writing and clarity.** On the whole, the paper is clearly written and has a big appendix containing details of its several theorems. At the same time, there are various small issues with the exposition (see below)."

The beginning of the introduction sounds like the goal of the paper is to develop and analyze a neural network-based eigensolver.  My understanding of an eigensolver is that this is an algorithm that produces the full list of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, the method considered in the paper gives us much less: first, it is restricted to $r$ largest eigenvalues and, second, the produced matrix $\\mathbf Y$ contains eigenvectors only up to an $r\\times r$ rotation, so there is still work to be done to extract the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. These points are not discussed; moreover, in the comparison of SNN with traditional eigensolvers only the advantages of the SNN are mentioned.\n\n2. *\u03b7 is a decreasing, non-negative function* - where do you use that $\\eta$ is decreasing?  \n\n3. *$D_G$ is the degree matrix associated to $G$* - what exactly is the definition of $D_G$?\n\n4. In Theorem 3.2, the notation for matrices with the subscript $S$ seems unexplained. Also, the matrix $\\Lambda$ is not defined (only $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ is defined)."
