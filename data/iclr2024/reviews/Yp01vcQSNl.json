The key ideas are: i) Dual node representations to capture source and target roles; ii) Directionality incorporated via asymmetric attention and dual query/key matrices, and iii) Localization via k-hop neighborhood attention.\n\nContributions:\n- Proposes DiGT, a transformer that uses dual node encodings and directional attention to capture directionality.\n- Introduces strategies to make other graph transformers directional via asymmetric/dual attention.\n- New directional graph datasets where direction correlates with labels.\n- Shows superior performance over GNNs and graph transformers on directional benchmarks."

Due to such limitation, the paper synthesizes two novel datasets, FlowGraph and Twitter, where the graph label is explicitly related to the edge direction pattern.

Doesn't this essentially downplay the advantage GTs have over message-passing GNNs? \n  - Also, the end of Section 3 mentions that \"DiGT uses dual node embeddings in all layers\", but Equations (9) and (10) imply that dual embeddings do not remain dual throughout the encoder, but are instead merged together into a single embedding $\\mathbf{Y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_p}$, then separated via linear layers $L_{VS}$ and $L_{VT}$ once every layer. Why is this the case?\n- [W2] **The experimental setup is unconvincing.** \n  - The paper claims that directionality does not play a significant role in existing datasets, proceeds by proposing synthetic datasets, and then performs graph classification on those networks instead. However, the first observation in Table 1 is not really comprehensive (experiments are only shown with certain model-dataset pairs), and the numbers do not necessarily overlap in standard deviation, which then leads to the question of \"Are these results truly indicative of directionality not playing a significant role in these datasets?\".\n  - The pipeline used to generate the Twitter datasets also seems problematic, due to how the label of each graph is chosen. Specifically, Twitter5 has 5 labels, each corresponding to the perturbation rate in [0, 25, 50, 75, 100]% used to rewire or reverse each edge in the original ego-network. Then for the experiments in Table 1, randomly flipping 50% of the edges in a Twitter5 graph labeled 1 (originally perturbed by 25%) would return a graph that is equivalent to a graph labeled 3 (originally perturbed by 75%) with no edge-flipping. In essence, it is unclear whether the drop in performance shown in Table 1 is simply due to having noisy labels, rather than the dataset exhibiting significance on directionality."

Due to its dual attention mechanism, I suspect DiGT would use more parameters compared to other models if using the same number of layers. Having the model sizes alongside performance metrics would help clarify whether the performance gains are due to the proposed mechanisms, and not due to having more parameters.\n- [Q2] **Missing results for Malnet-tiny of Tables 2 and 3.** Are these all blank due to out-of-memory issues? If so, it would be better to fill them in with OOM."
