It focuses on the sequential adaptation of a robustly trained source model to multiple unlabeled target domains. The authors pinpoint the issue of catastrophic forgetting prevalent in current domain adaptation techniques and skillfully reconfigure existing baselines to function in this innovative setting. Subsequently, they present a teacher-student consistency learning approach designed to attenuate the effects of forgetting, thereby facilitating efficient adaptation across multiple targets sequentially. The empirical evidence provided substantially corroborates the assertion that this methodology not only enhances performance but also significantly curtails issues related to catastrophic forgetting."

The manuscript restricts its experiments to synthetic tests on established UDA benchmarks, raising questions about the practical value of continual SFDA in real-world applications. In actual practice, it seems feasible to merge all target domains into a single large one and adapt the source model accordingly. Additionally, identifying or defining the source and target domains in real-world applications is already a challenging task, complicating the applicability of this approach.\n\n2. Another concern pertains to the originality of CoSDA, as it appears to amalgamate various existing strategies, including the teacher-student model, mixup, and information maximization. While the use of the exponential moving average method is a common and sensible strategy to prevent overfitting, the rationale behind employing mixup and information maximization to tackle this issue isn't clear or intuitive.\n\n3. Lastly, the presentation of results in the tables is somewhat overwhelming and perplexing. The abundance of statistics, compounded by the use of multiple colors, makes it difficult to interpret the data and grasp the essential outcomes. Simplifying these tables for clarity and ease of understanding would be highly beneficial.\n\nSome typos in this manuscript: \n1. \"by by consolidating data\"\n2. \"In this section, We ...\""

Thus, the method is quite general, and could be easily combined with the existing source-free domain adaptation method, which is proved in the experimental section.\n\n- The experimental sections are detailed, which cover several benchmarks, and reproduce lots of existing method for the continual source-free domain adaptation setting."

As the paper mentioned, MI is proved to be very efficient in unsupervised clustering task [1], which is a similar topic to source-free domain adaptation. Also, AaD also discuss MI and relate it with several other different methods.\n\n- BN updating trick. Actually one paper in continual learning gives a thorough investigation about how BN influence the continual learning performance, with a short conclusion that the running statistics heavily biased towards the current task, which may influence the performance on the old task. In turn, BN statistics are also important for the current task, as mentioned in GSFDA that simply forwarding with the test data once before adaptation could improve the performance. The author could add some discussions with the above mentioned methods, as in the proposed way the teacher model has more information about the old domain while the student model focus on the statistics on the current domains.\n\n\n***reference***\n\n[1] Learning Discrete Representations via Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training.

While existing approaches on SFDA focus exclusively on target domain performance, the authors propose a new method, CoSDA, that not only enhances target domain adaptation but also preserves the source domain performance. The core idea revolves around using a student-teacher framework, where the teacher model is updated via EMA (exponential moving average) of the student model weights to prevent forgetting. The mixup augmentation is used to drive the learning process via consistency regularization between the pair of networks, and a mutual information maximization loss is also added to obtain better pseudo-labels. Experiments are shown on four classification benchmarks: DomainNet, OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA. Beyond single target adaptation, results are also shown on multi-target adaptation (where the domains appear sequentially) to highlight the continual learning capabilities of the framework. When compared to existing works on SFDA and Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), CoSDA achieves both higher accuracy and good robustness against forgetting."

CoTTA (Wang et al., 2022) ensures knowledge preservation by stochastically preserving a subset of the source model\u2019s parameters during each update\" but fail to mention this other crucial aspect of this paper which is directly related to their method. The inclusion of the mutual information regularization loss for better pseudo-labels is also borrowed directly from a previous SFDA approach SHOT [2].

                "value": "The paper focuses on mitigating catastrophic forgetting in the context of source-free domain adaptation. The authors take several steps to address this challenge, including re-implementing existing methods and introducing a novel approach called CoSDA, which leverages a teacher-student model to achieve continuous adaptation. Specifically, the authors introduce a consistency loss based on KL-divergence to transfer knowledge from the teacher network to the student network. They also employ a KL-divergence-based regularization loss to stabilize training with Mixup augmentations. Additionally, the authors present two distinct optimization strategies for updating the teacher and student networks."

                "value": "## Majors\n\n1. I have concerns regarding the formulation of consistency loss which is the main contribution of the work. Equation 1 is confusing. From my understanding, h_{\\psi}(\\tilde{x}) should refer to the output logits from the student network. If so, minimizing the divergence between two distributions from different mathematical spaces does not make any sense.  To be specific, \\tilde{p} is a softmax probability vector with each element in the range [0,1], while h_{\\psi}(\\tilde{x}) has elements ranging from negative infinity to positive infinity.\n\n2. Please add an ablation study to demonstrate the potential issue of the proposed consistency loss collapsing. My suspicion is that this collapse occurs due to the divergence between two distinct mathematical spaces.\n\n3. In batch normalization, the mean and variance are computed based on the activations within each mini-batch, which is a subset of the entire dataset. The statistics are calculated separately for each mini-batch as the model processes the data during training. This is what allows batch normalization to adapt to the statistics of the current batch and helps in stabilizing and accelerating training. However, the authors mentioned that their mean and variance are calculated based on the whole dataset for batch normalization, which does not make sense. As per my understanding, the moving average mean and variance are computed by accumulating the mean and variance from each batch using an exponential moving average formula (\\alpha*\\mu_{moving} + (1-\\alpha)*\\mu_{i}). The moving average mean and variance are not the mean and variance of the whole dataset. The lack of clarity on batch normalization in the paper raises concerns about its overall quality.\n\n4. I may have a misunderstanding regarding the evaluation settings; however, based on my interpretation of the paper, it appears that the proposed method does not demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline approaches in terms of target domain classification accuracies. I kindly request the authors to provide a more detailed explanation or consider revising the experiment section for improved clarity on this matter.\n\n## Minors\n\n1. The proposed work appears to be closely aligned with federated learning. I am curious about the authors' motivation for framing this work as a sequence of source-free domain adaptation. To me, the workflow seems to have stronger connections to federated learning rather than source-free domain adaptation. Thus, the literature on federated learning should be given.\n\n3. typos: 3.1 \u201dto consist with\u201d -> \u201cto be consistent with\u201d"

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. In the second paragraph of the introduction, the authors mentioned that \u201cSFDA also allows for spatio-temporal separation of the adaptation process since the model training on source domain is independent of the knowledge transfer on target domain\u201d. What does the spatio-temporal separation refer to? \n\n2. In Equation 1, is h_{\\psi}(\\tilde{x}) referring to the logits or the softmax probabilities? If it represents the logits, it raises a question regarding the use of KL-divergence between two distributions: \\tilde{p}, which is a softmax probability vector with each element in the range [0,1], and h_{\\psi}(\\tilde{x}), which has elements ranging from negative infinity to positive infinity.\n\n3. I do not quite understand the in-sequence evaluation settings. From the result tables, the authors listed, most baselines perform better without the proposed methods. Then, how could the readers evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The proposed method lacks novelty in terms of the framework design. For example, the teacher-student architecture has been proposed from the self-supervised learning framework, e.g., MoCo. The mix-up is another already invented technique to augment both the input space and the label space. The consistent loss has been utilized in those above mentioned methods already.\n\nMeanwhile, the mutual information maximization is a widely applied regularization technique during representation learning. Combining all, I think the novelty of the design is hard to justify.\n\n2. The paper claims continual SFDA, where from the method design, there is no specific module is designed to deal with the model catastrophic forgetting issue, except accepting the teacher model\u2019s hard label to measure the KL divergence from the student prediction on the mixed up sample. \n\nThe teacher model is leveraging exponential averaging, but the student model is not in any manner distilled from the teacher model. The model weights forgetting is not addressed in any technical design.\n\n3. Across the compared methods, the proposed CoSDA does not show advantageous results over the other methods. For example, in Table 1, CosDA is not compellingly better than EdgeMix, where actually many of the DA protocols EdgeMix shows better results.\n\nIn Table 2, CosDA even combined with some other modules, such as NRC or AaD, is not better than AaD. This suggests that the proposed way does not achieve as advantageous performance as the state-of-the-art methods."
