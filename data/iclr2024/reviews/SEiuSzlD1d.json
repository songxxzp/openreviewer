The authors introduce masked ray and view modeling (MRVM) to demonstrate that 3D implicit representation learning can be improved by mask-based modeling. In practice, the masking mechanism in MRVM carries out a ray level to enhance the information interaction along each ray and also a view level to promote the message-passing across different reference views. The numerical experiments and visualizations show the efficiency of the proposed method on several NeRF image reconstruction datasets."

The extra 'fine' samples - whether they are they taken, as in the classical NeRF, according to an initial estimation of density from the coarse sample. And in this respect - shouldn't the masking prediction be focused at the more important (close-to-surface) high density locations, rather than at the coarse sampling?\n3] Impact on training time is not clear. Even though training time and procedures are very clearly presented in the appendix, I am missing what is the addition in comparison to the baseline, and which components are responsible for it?\n4] Clarity [minor]: (i) I would suggest improving Figure 1 to include some of the notations (g, h, etc') ; (ii) What are the blue dashed arrows in Figure 2 supposed to represent?"

By training the masked fine branch to predict the unmasked coarse branch, the authors show that the model can learn better representations and generalize better to unseen scenes. The author claims that this work is the first to adapt the concept of masked self-supervised learning to the domain of generalizable NeRF."
