The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in various semi-alignable environments and provides a solution to the human engineering effort required for crafting reward machines. The work aims to improve learning efficiency in reinforcement learning by enabling the transfer of abstract skills and reward signals across disparate domains."

The idea of understanding how certain MDPs relate and extracting information from one MDP to learn another seems quite intriguing. Building frameworks that allow for the inclusion of large language models is also a promising direction as it might allow to automate the definition of reward translations.\n\nContextualization with prior work  \nI am not familiar with this type of literature but I am familiar with the standard reinforcement learning literature.\n* It seems that the related work section as well as section 2.2 on reward machines cover a good number of related work to contextualize the present manuscript.\n\nNovelty  \n* It seems that the idea of automating the understanding of MDP relationships via abstract concepts is relatively novel. However, I have to mention again that I am not very familiar with the sub-field literature."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Textual clarity\n* The paper would benefit from additional proof reading as there are various typos and grammatical errors.\n* The introduction contradicts itself with respect to prior work and it is not clear to me what the claim with respect to previous work\u2019s capabilities is. It first states that Kim et al, Raychaudhuri et al provide methods that can handle unaligned demonstrations but then claims that the example with unaligned trajectories cannot be handled. See Q1.\n* It is not clear from Figure 1 what an semi-alignable MDP exactly is.\n* The reward machine is first mentioned very early on in the paper but not defined until section 4 which makes it very hard to follow much of the text. The section on reward machines did not explain properly what a reward machine is, what its inputs and outputs are or what its purpose is.\n* Several references to the Appendix are missing the exact location of where to look, see e.g. P4 section 4.\n* The construction of propositional symbols is hinted at several times but never explained. It is not clear how an LLM can be used to extract these symbols.\n* Figures 2 and 3 are hard to read due to very small font size and very overloaded. It is hard to understand what they are supposed to demonstrate.\n\nMathematical rigor and clarity  \nVarious mathematical concepts and definitions are unclear or used incorrectly, here are some examples:\n* Section 3 introduces various new sets of variables that are not standard to the MDP. However, their motivation or meaning is not explained. It is not clear to me what an abstract state space or a skill space are. Then, the MDP does not contain the action and abstract state spaces anymore but rather undefined variables $A_y$ and $B_y$. The second task MDP also uses the same notation as the abstract space as an indicator. My guess is that this is a mix-up but it happens several times throughout the paper making it hard to follow which notation means what. Also, the notation $y$ is overloaded here since it refers to the abstract state space already.\n* Definition 1 is not very clear. The notation $O$ is not defined and as a result I\u2019m not sure what exactly the constraints on policy optimality and y-dynamics are. See Q2.\n* Various instances in the paper use notation that is not explained or only explained much later. See e.g., page 4 section 4 \u201cseamless mapping between $\\mathcal{U}$, $\\mathcal{F}$, and $\\mathcal{P}$ is achievable\u201d. I\u2019m assuming that $\\mathcal{U}$ is supposed to be $U$ and $\\mathcal{F}$ is supposed to be $F$. \n* There seems to be a typo for $\\delta_u$ in Definition 3.\n* The explanation of the function of a reward machine MDP in section 4.1 uses various definitions incorrectly or uses functions that are not defined. For instance, $\\delta_u$ was defined as a function of limited states but now takes in a limited state as well as a propositional symbol, $\\delta_r$ does not take two limited states, the MDP with a reward machine does not have a reward function $r$ or $\\hat{r}$.\n* The function $V$ is not defined in equation 3. My guess is that it is supposed to be the standard value function from the RL framework but then it is used incorrectly since it should be a function of a single state.\n\nSince the notation is used incorrectly in various places or not defined, I did not check the proofs for correctness.\n\nExperimental evaluation\n* The environment descriptions are very vague. In section 5.1, I\u2019m not sure what it means that an original task is on the left and a target task on the right. From section 5, It is not clear to me what the experimental setup is. Equation 3 does not compute a reward function.\n* Figure 5b is missing a legend and I cannot assume that the colors correspond to the same baselines as in the other Figures since there is a red line not present in the other plots and the ordering of NRT changes across plots. As a result, I cannot determine whether the claims with respect to this experiment are accurate.\n* The experimental evaluation is rather short and only contains very simple environments and the conclusions seem either hard to determine due to high variance (Fig 6b) or weak results (Fig 6c).\n* One of the main claims of the experiments is that \u201cThe training results demonstrate that transferring rewards via isomorphic and homomorphic reward machines enhances learning in reinforcement tasks across different domains, improving training efficacy and performance.\u201d However, this claim is not well supported since isomorphic reward functions have not been tested and homomorphic reward functions only worked in a very limited set of the experiments.\n\nOverall, I believe this paper would benefit from iterations of clarity improvements both on the textual as well as mathematical front. The experiments could be more extensive and some of the claims seem overstated. As a result, I recommend rejection of the manuscript."

Giving a more intuitive example or supporting the argument here could be useful for improving the clarify of the paper.\n- The usage of GPT-4 for constructing a reward machine is interesting, but if it's possible, it's not clear to me why it's still necessary to transfer the reward, because it might be possible to generate the rewards for the downstream task directly.
