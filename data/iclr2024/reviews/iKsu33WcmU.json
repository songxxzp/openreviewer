Furthermore, the LLM effectively combines user questions with the prompts to generate relevant answers.\n\nIn summary, this paper provides a well-organized presentation of an innovative concept. I find the idea presented in this paper quite interesting. The preliminary results show promise, and it's evident that ProtChatGPT has significant potential to make valuable contributions to the field of bioinformatics and related research areas."

I am particularly intrigued by how ProtChatGPT performs when presented with homologous proteins. If space allows, I suggest the author explore the possibility of including comparisons and analyses of homologous proteins that possess similar sequences or structures but manifest significantly different functions. Such an experiment could further enhance the validation of ProtChatGPT's utility."

The SPICE and PubMedBERT scores move closer to such an evaluation, but they are not sufficient to \u201ctrust\u201d the output of such a model yet.

How is this literature chosen and used in the model?   \n\nQ4] How were training and test sets split? If random split, what was the overlap, sequence/description/family/function similarity across splits? \n\n\nMinor comments and additional suggestions\n\nFor clarity, consider adding which of the VLP types your approach falls into (i.e. representation vs generative)  \n\nIn the second paragraph of Section 1 RCSB-PDB is introduced without explaining what it is. The sentence containing this reference is also very unclear. I suggest re-framing it to make clear that you are making a connection between language and the evolutionary information contained in protein sequences. \u201cEvolution\u201d does not have a \u201cspoken language\u201d as such.   \n\nIt is not clear how the learnable tokens are initialized/where they are coming from and their role.
