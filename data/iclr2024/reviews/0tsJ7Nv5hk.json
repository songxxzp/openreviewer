                "value": "The paper starts by defining a notion called relative stability and illustrating the stability of network weights during training tends to plateau early on. Such observation motivates the authors to develop the method Orthogonality-Informed Adaptive Low-Rank (OIALR). This approach starts with an SVD of the weight matrices ($U \\Sigma V^T$) and only updates $\\Sigma$ at the majority time of training. This strategy significantly trims the number of training parameters. Empirical data further substantiates that the OIALR method either matches or marginally underperforms when compared with the baseline full-rank training, yet is less prune to overfitting."

                "value": "A major contribution listed in the paper is reducing the number of trainable parameters during training hence allowing shorter training time and enabling fine-tuning and production on resource-constrained devices (as stated by the authors in the Conclusion section). Yet, this assertion seems not well substantiated by the experiments: (1) based on the experiments listed in the paper, OIALR shows nearly identical training time as the baseline and sometimes requires even longer time; (2) concerning memory allocation, the OIALR method, especially at step 7 in Algorithm 2, demand more memory than the baseline (factorizing a matrix to 3 matrices increase its memory cost) and throughout the training for a long time until $r$ is decreased to some small value. Hence the resource reduction is questionable; (3) if we instead consider the RAM consumption during training (given OIALR's reduced parameter count), there might indeed be potential savings. However, the paper lacks empirical validation in this context (e.g., a table to compare the RAM used between OIALR and the baseline). Given these observations, the reviewer finds it hard to evaluate the contribution of the paper as of the current version."

                "value": "1. In Figure 1, the stability measure exhibits an initial decline followed by a subsequent rise. What could account for this initial drop in the early stages?\n2. In some of the experiments shown in the paper, the authors show the results for both tuned and untuned OIALR, but not in other experiments, which is a bit confusing to the reviewer. Is this due to time or resource constraints? \n3. To clarify, in Section 3, the authors wrote \"To obtain a two dimensional (2D) representation of a weight tensor with more than two dimensions we maintain the original weight\u2019s leading dimension and collapse those remaining\", does this mean that for a tensor with dimension $a \\times b \\times c$, it will be transformed to a matrix with dimension $ a \\times (bc) $?"
