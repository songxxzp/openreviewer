It takes from page 4 to page 7 to introduce the full architecture/losses. This is fine, since there are many non-trivial steps, but having them in one place would help a lot (perhaps in an extended Tab. 1, which by the way should be labelled as an algorithm). \n\n2. The following claim from the abstract: \"demonstrating state-of-the-art performance using block-local learning\" is not correct -- ~54% top1 accuracy on ImageNet from Tab. 2 with a ResNet50 is not very good. It's nice to see that the model doesn't fail, but it's not SoTA at all (even AlexNet reaches 56% top1 accuracy). \n\n3. It's also worth noting that block/layer-wise learning can perform as well as backprop, and with a similar idea of using small backward error networks. See Fig. 1 and overall results in [Belilovsky et al., 2019] (cited in this paper). It's not clear if the performance difference is due to inherent problems with the probabilistic interpretation in this paper or some other reasons."

First of all, the authors should use the ICLR style (currently the typeface is wrong and citations are not highlighted) and fit the paper into 9 pages. \n2. Top-3 for MNIST/CIFAR10 is not a standard metric. Moreover, given 10 classes and the simplicity of the datasets, anything but top-1 is mostly meaningless.\n3. In S1.3, I think the first expectation should be just an integral over $z_k$. Expectation adds $p(z_k)$ which shouldn\u2019t be there.\n4. Citation issue: Jimenez Rezende et al. (2016) citation accidentally includes the author\u2019s middle name.\n5. Eqs. S12-13 and later: should there be brackets starting after the first sum?\n\n**Clarification questions**\n\n2. Eq. 7 should have $\\beta_k$ instead of $q_k$, right?\n\n3. This bit on page 6 is confusing:\n> furthermore, the loss is local with respect to learning, i.e. it doesn\u2019t require global signals to be communicated to each block. In this sense, our approach differs from previous contrastive methods that need to distinguish between positive and negative samples. In our approach, any sample that passes through a block can be used directly for weight updating and is treated in the same way\n\nThe paper was about supervised learning up until now, right?\n\n**Conceptual questions**:\n\n1. What\u2019s the actual speed-up compared to backprop? With a naive implementation that doesn't account for unlocked updates, it should be as expensive. I guess it might be possible to put different blocks on different devices so the backward pass in earlier blocks will happen early on, but that wouldn\u2019t work on a single GPU (right?) and also wouldn\u2019t be easy to implement in PyTorch. How was it implemented by the authors?\n\n2. Judging by Fig. 2, posterior bootstrapping introduces backward locking. Is that correct?\n\n\n\n\n-----------\n**Post-rebuttal**: since my questions were addressed, but the weaknesses like performance are still there, I'm increasing the score from 5 to 6."
