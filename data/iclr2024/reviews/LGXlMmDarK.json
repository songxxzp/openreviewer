Specifically, the authors claim that the limited expressiveness, oversmoothing, and over-squashing problems can be remedied with the adoption of the structural stochasticity. Based upon this observation, the author suggests a design principle of the structure of the GNNs with the stochasticity."

Both contain inequalities between the one with stochasticity and the original one. If the difference is marginal, as the number of layers $K$ increases, this would not affect the improvement. For example, if the values of the two are $1/2$ and $1/3$, then $(1/2)^K \\approxeq (1/3)^K$ even for the moderate $K$.\n2. Technical contributions seem to be rather limited: The proof that the authors relied on is the convexity of the activation functions (or that of the first derivative of the activations), which can be limited in practice. For example, sigmoid and tangent hyperbolic functions are not convex.\n3. The stochasticity assumption on the case where edge strength can be perturbed, but no edge is added in the original adjacency matrix, is bit limited.\n4. It would have been nice if the assumptions that the authors made is presented in a clearer manner (e.g., by explicitly put \"Assumption\" separately from the normal texts or Theorem/Lemma statement).\n5.

It also discovers that stochastic GNNs can exceed the discriminative power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman tests. It introduces a method called BRONX, which quantifies the structural uncertainty in GNNs through variational inference.
