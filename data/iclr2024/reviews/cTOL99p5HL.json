            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The biggest concern about this submission is limited technical novelty and scientific value.\n\nFirst of all, using LLMs to assist high-level planning and reasoning in sequential decision-making tasks, such as those in Minecraft, is not novel (Huang et al., 2022ab, Wang et al., 2023ab, Yuan et al., 2023, Nottingham et al., 2023). While authors claim the proposed method is different because it is so-called *LLM-native*, I believe this should be more considered as a drawback, due to the fact that a huge amount of domain knowledge is required to carefully craft the action abstractions. Further, the proposed method emphasizes on using LLMs as planner and for reasoning, only few analysis, if any, is provided to explain why it is effective. This renders the proposed method more like an application of existing LLMs.\n\nI do feel the scientific value is also limited due to inappropriate experiment settings. First of all, while authors claim the proposed system to address open-world tasks, only item collecting tasks are considered in the experiments. However, even in the Minecraft domain, possible task categories are not limited only to collecting items (Fan et al., 2022). To add on this point, the designed action abstraction overfits the fact that only this type of tasks is considered, further questioning the feasibility of this system to truly open-world tasks with diverse semantics. The main experimental comparison is also insufficient. Specifically, authors only formally compared against two methods, while one of them (AutoGPT) is even just an open-source software, not a proper academic paper. Although authors include results from RL-based methods such as Dreamer V3 and VPT, the distinct difference in settings makes them not directly comparable. While table 2 also shows learning steps for them, it would be more proper to add up the learning steps for the LLMs used in this system. Actually, it would be more appropriate to compare against Voyager (Wang et al., 2023b.)\n\nFinally, the generality of the proposed system is also doubtful. Given that Minecraft is one of the most popular video games in the world, the LLM used in this system is very likely to be trained on related information. Therefore, it is unsure whether the performance gain is achieved by the proposed pipeline, or the fact that powerful LLMs know pretty well about the domain (Minecraft).\n\n# References\n- Huang et al., Language models as zero-shot planners: Extracting actionable knowledge for embodied agents, ICML 2022a.\n- Huang et al., Inner monologue: Embodied reasoning through planning with language models, arXiv 2022b.\n- Wang et al.,  Describe, explain, plan and select: Interactive planning with large language models enables open-world multi-task agents, NeurIPS 2023a.\n- Wang et al., Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models, arXiv 2023b.\n- Yuan et al., Plan4mc: Skill reinforcement learning and planning for open-world Minecraft tasks, arXiv 2023.\n- Nottingham et al., Do Embodied Agents Dream of Pixelated Sheep: Embodied Decision Making using Language Guided World Modelling, ICML 2023.\n- Fan et al., MineDojo: Building Open-Ended Embodied Agents with Internet-Scale Knowledge, NeurIPS 2022."

                "value": "- Method Design:\n    1. Memory: Will GITM be able to replicate its successful record in memory in the new environment? Since GITM uses a rule-based controller, it can execute any theoretically feasible plan successfully. Therefore, conducting experiments under this setting would be meaningless.\n    2. Know ledge Library\uff1aGITM relies on a manually designed knowledge library, which is costly due to the numerous items and corresponding rules in Minecraft. Additionally, not all environments have access to this knowledge beforehand. As a result, GITM's ability to transition to other environments is significantly limited.\n    3. Action API: GITM did not utilize an action space similar to that of minedojo or humans. Instead, it relied on manually designing numerous functions, which is both expensive and difficult to apply in different environments.\n- Experimental Details\n    1. Ablation on Language Models. The main component of GITM is a pretrained language model (LM). Therefore, the author should perform ablation experiments on the LM, using open-source models like LLaMA2.\n    2. The feedback provided by human-writting during execution is much more detailed than what is available in the original Minecraft and other environments. Can GITM works when no human-written feedbacks are supported.\n    3. To showcase the effectiveness and robustness of GITM, it is recommended to use more open-ended environments.\n    4. What is the maximum time allotted for each task? Have there been any changes in the environment rules? What is the initial state of the agent upon birth? How many seeds does the environment generate? The author has overlooked several important details, which greatly impacts the reliability of experimental results.\n- Environmental Settings\n    1. Comparing the success rate of GITM in completing tasks like Minecraft with models such as VPT and Dreamer is unfair because these models are not intended for multi-tasking. Moreover, DEPS is an unsuitable comparison object due to its use of a learning-based control policy instead of the manually designed rule-based control policy used in GITM. Additionally, DEPS does not utilize privileged information like lidar, which is considered important in minedojo. The author should consider comparing with these methods under same setting that does not employ this information at least.\n    2. The recent work Voyager utilized settings similar to GITM. For instance, it employed mineflayer as a control mechanism and translated the surrounding environment into a text-world format.I observed that the author utilized information from a 10*10 block area surrounding the agent. This undermines Minecraft's partial observation feature, which allows the agent to see information about items obstructed by blocks. Consequently, GITM achieved an abnormally high diamond acquisition rate. However, this practice is not permitted in Minecraft, even for human players.\n    \n    In summary, if GITM can only solve text-world and attempts to ignore the partial visual observation and control difficulty in Minecraft, I recommend the authors to use `crafter` or other similar textworlds instead of conducting experiments in Minecraft, as this is unacceptable in the community's perspective.\n    \n- Others\n    1. Are GITM executation videos are available?\n    2. It appears that GITM contains numerous details and has implemented significant changes to the environment, including modifications to the action space. The author can enhance this process by submitting code to improve transparency and reliability."
