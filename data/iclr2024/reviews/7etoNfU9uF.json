The authors' argument is to be able to transform events into point clouds and thus improve network performance: \"SpikePoint, is an end-to-end point-based SNN architecture\". However, the figure shows that after the grouping and sampling stage, the information is transformed by coding the firing rate: \"The coordinate is converted into spikes by rate coding, and the results of action recognition are obtained by the local feature extractor, global feature extractor, and classifier in turn\". This point needs to be clearly justified, and in particular why isn't the temporal information kept precisely at this point in the processing process. Is that information rather represented in the previous stages?"

What parallels do you see between your method and these methods?\n- In Table 7, you show that performance is optimal for a given number of time steps... What can you deduce from this result in relation to the complexity of the data representation?\n\nMinor:\n- \"C represents the set of moments\" - you mean instants?\n- The point \"A detailed derivation can be found in Appendix A.4, which describes how this connection solves the problem of backpropagation.\" is vaguely introduced, please describe minimally the method in the main text.\n- The syntax of the paper did not allow me to fully follow all arguments. I have not taken this into account in my evaluation, but the authors should use a service, even an automatic one, that allows clarification of certain points. Fix for instance \"bionic neurons\" > \"biological neurons\" or vague statements like \"to harmoniously extract local...\", . Also check the sentence \"We do identity mapping by changing the residual module to the following equation in SNN refer (Hu et al., 2021; Fang et al., 2021a; Feng et al., 2022). And the coefficient \u03c3\u2032 (Il+m\u22121 + Sl ) in Eq. 29 of error propagation of the corresponding residual term is canceled.\n- The LaTeX formatting of the paper could be improved. In particular, quotations in the text should be enclosed in parentheses, e.g. using `citep`. Text appearing in equations (\"erf\", \"clip\", \"centroid\", \"lif\", ...) should be formatted as text, e.g. using `\\text``."
