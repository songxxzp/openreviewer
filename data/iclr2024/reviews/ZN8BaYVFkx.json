            "questions": {
                "value": "1) Can the authors clearly state/elaborate in their paper, in which ways their training algorithm is different than the work by [Finlay & Oberman 2019]? https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11468.pdf\n\n2) Proposed approach has several simplifications/assumptions on the ultimate gradient l0-norm regularization idea. At the end, the used training algorithm seems to become also similar to the well-known (clean) logit pairing approach [Kannan, Kurakin & Goodfellow, 2018]. At the very least, the objective simply uses adversarial examples for an output probability distribution regularizer, which has been the most fundamental form of adversarial training to date (see e.g., [Zhang et al. ICML 2019]). Hence all in all, I can not clearly see any innovation from the ML security side in this paper. Can the authors experimentally compare why their choice would be particularly any better in the case of SNNs, than using one of the other powerful adversarial training/regularization methods (e.g., TRADES [Zhang et al. ICML 2019] or adversarial logit pairing [Kannan, Kurakin & Goodfellow, 2018])?\n\n3) Authors claim to use an \"ensemble attack\" for white-box evaluations, which requires further clarification. Their implementation of an ensemble \"conducts multiple attacks on each sample and reports the strongest attack\". Can the authors provide an exemplary outlined test set case more clearly on how these evaluations are reported?\n\n4) For this attack ensemble to be meaningful and reveal any impact of gradient obfuscation, there should actually be cases where the surrogate gradient function is changing its width, rather than only its shape for fixed parameters. The width parameter $\\gamma=1$ of the triangular surrogate should be accounted for. Authors should run an extensive evaluation with for instance $\\gamma\\in[0.1,3.0]$ in fine-grained steps of 0.1, and demonstrate that changing this parameter does not at all influence the capability of the adversary any better than using different surrogate gradient shapes. This part overall needs strong empirical justification.\n\n5) Models were trained using PGD-5 adversarial examples, but the Algorithm 1 denotes adv. examples obtained via one-step FGSM. Which one is correct? Does this mean that PGD-5 is the general AT approach adopted in SR* models, but in any case the regularizer term was always obtained via FGSM? Needs clarification overall.\n\n6) Following my question above, Table 2 is a bit complicated in how SR and AT can be disentangled. In the case of ablation models without AT but SR, how were the adv. examples to compute the regularization term, obtained? None of these details are clear in the paper.\n\n7) Proof of Thm 1 in Appendix A seems agnostic to any function f, regardless of being an SNN. However, it appears to implicitly make the assumption that the SNN uses direct input coding. Can the authors comment if these assumptions would also hold for SNNs that use Poisson input coding, or SNNs that do not necessarily use IF neurons (i.e.., with membrane potential leak)? Wouldn't then the error that should be accounted for in the finite differences approximation would be large? Did the authors experiment with other types of more realistic SNNs at all?\n\n8) Did the authors perform any simulations on dynamic vision sensor data where SNNs are designed to be more beneficial for?\n\n9) Since PGD-5 is used via BPTT during training for 200 epochs, than the authors should outline a table with the computational overhead (wall-clock time) of their approach, in comparison to simple AT or RAT with PGD-5 as well.\n\n10) Figure 3 should also include adversarially trained models in comparison (not only Vanilla), since such SNNs are already implicitly inducing a similar behavior.\n\nMinor comment: Eq (3) & (4) are already defined as solutions of an adversarial example in the l_infty norm (since the sign function is used). Therefore at the end of Sec 3.2, authors should correct the \"l_p norm\", since p is already infty in this setting."
