Could this hinder model training?\n\nWhy is learnable masking so important for AD, when random masks are fine for other tasks?\n\nThe batch size is very large, and is an important parameter as it affects the dimensionality of M. How does the methodology perform with a smaller batch size? Also, can the methodology still work if the batch size changes between training and test sets?"

                "value": "The manuscript proposes a new method for anomaly detection in tabular data. The proposed method detects anomalies based on the reconstruction error of appropriately trained autoencoder. In the proposed training procedure, a tabular input is first masked according to diverse masking strategies to produce a batch of masked inputs. Diverse masks are produced by a set of models trained to output masks of high variety. The obtained masked input is then fed to an autoencoder which reconstructs the initial input. The corresponding optimization objective consists of a reconstruction loss and a loss which enforces the diversity between the generated masks. During inference, inputs are marked as anomalies if they are unsuccessfully reconstructed which is indicated by the high reconstruction loss. The proposed method achieves strong experimental results under considered setups which include real and synthetic test anomalies.\n\nThe manuscript claims the following contributions:\n\nC1. Masked modeling framework for anomaly detection in tabular data.\n\nC2. Masking strategy which captures underlying high-level correlations in the normal data.\n \nC3. Strong experimental results on tabular data."

The key idea is to train a network on the clean input to generate the mask, and then apply the mask into these inputs before feeding them through the auto-encoder to reconstruct the clean inputs. The mask matrices are designed as soft masks via sigmoid function. To avoid the collapse of the generator in generating trivial and redundant mask matrices, the authors regularize the reconstruction loss with diversity loss which penalizes the masking matrices to be far away. The experiments are conducted with 20 benchmark datasets and compared with 9 baselines. The experimental results are encouraging compared to baselines on benchmark datasets. The paper also shows a number of ablation studies to understand the impacts of each individual proposed component and of masking strategy, and how it detects different types of anomalies. In addition, the authors also perform the analysis on robustness of number of masking matrices and contamination and some other studies relating to the feature correlation."
