                "value": "I have concerns regarding the technical aspects of this work, as follows:\n\n1. Several aspects are not clearly defined and discussed in the paper. For instance, after (2), what is r_i, and how is it defined?\n2. As the structural re-parameterization is done each round (in my understanding), it certainly adds computational burden during training on the already constrained nodes. Then, the question arises: what is the cost of executing (4)?\n3. The manuscript is not clear in justifying how, through (5), to assess the contribution of branches to the global aggregation. I feel the authors missed (in 2.2.2) building a clear connection between re-parameterization and local training operation during model training. For instance, how \"contribution\" is quantified per se, and is this only with the adaptation in the number of layers, and also the number of parameters per layer, and so on.  \n4. Is the number of epoch E fixed for each client? If so, why? because one may argue clients can be adaptive in choosing the number of epochs during local training.\n5. It is unclear why the aggregation scheme, as in (11), was used. Also, can the authors please justify further their claim: \"operations in re-parameterization guarantee lossless knowledge transfer across heterogeneous local models\"?\n6. While the experiments cover a broad range of (relevant) baselines (which is commendable), however, I am not sure the comparison is sufficient to demonstrate improvement. For instance, the authors have not mentioned why the number of local epochs was set (fixed) to 3 (for all clients); the model capacity is only abstracted without particular practical details - how do make these changes in the computing abilities; no convergence analysis (experimental) is provided, which can be added in my understanding; training time-complexity analysis is missing (also, what is the training efficiency), and so on. In fairness analysis, how is the accuracy reported?\n\nMinor:\n- Figure 1 is unclear in its current form, and the description is insufficient. How to interpret this? The representative Diverse Branch Block (DBB), as in [Ding et al., 2021a,b], is unclear to the readers unfamiliar for readers.\n- notations are a bit difficult to follow."

One would expect that the aggregated (server-side) model would need additional capacity to learn from the wide distribution of data, rather than the device submodes. This might restrict the overall capacity of the final aggregated model. Maybe the authors can further motivate this approach. \n\n- Similarly, this paper focuses on convolutions, limiting a bit the applicability on other architectures \n\n- The authors tackle a heterogeneous environment with device of different capabilities. In most such use-cases devices typically are sampled and are likely to participate for just a few rounds (in some use-cases just once) during the FL training. I was wondering what would be the impact of having clients participating only for 1 or K (where K is small) rounds. \n\n- The evaluation does not provide any insights on energy, memory footprint, transfer data volume, convergence speed. This is important as this method is focusing towards performance on a heterogeneous set of devices."

                "value": "- The fact that we scale up the model on-device, does this mean that the largest possible model we can support for inference is determined by the weakest devices ? \n\n- In the experiments, the authors show that other methods (HeteroFL , Split Mix etc) have worse accuracy. But a benefit of these approaches is that they can scale *down* the model (I.e., submode training). Whereas dynamicFL practically scales up. I was wondering if the authors used a larger initial (aggregated) architecture for these models when compared to their method. Essentially, a fair comparison would be having the other methods provision for the large devices at the aggregator level (I.e., having a larger initial model)."
