They do so by incorporating a low-rank and a high-rank embedding scheme where high-rank scheme is shown to be sensitive towards domain specific features whereas low-rank scheme is shown to be sensitive towards domain-invariant features. Additionally, to weigh these features during adaptation, they introduced a homeostatic knowledge allotment strategy where they exploit the probabilistic nature of multiple forward passes to get the best set of parameters. Overall, the authors are achieving reasonably well results."

The authors have incorporated a paradigm that does just that. \n\nOriginality\n- This particular challenge is still at its infancy and the proposed ideas in this paper can help mature the challenge. In terms of originality, the authors have incorporated similar to [1] with their domain specific and domain invariant learning scheme; however, these proposed ideas have shown to contribute significantly, and they have shown it in the results. Additionally, their homeostatic knowledge allotment scheme is also quite useful in terms of what features should weigh more than the other. Therefore, I believe the work is original and is contributing to the field.\n\nQuality\n- Since the challenge has a very big  real world applicability, and the approach has shown to perform very well in this regard.\n- Additionally, the authors have shown extensive experiments on various standard datasets where they outperform other SOTA approaches including CoTTA [2] and VDP [1].\n- The authors have shown extensive ablation study and motivation to use the different components of the approach in the paper.\n\nClarity\n- The paper is well written and easy to follow.\n- The authors have clarified their statements with equations and experiments. \n\nSignificance\n- As mentioned previously, the CTTA has a lot of real-world applicability in IID and non-IID scenarios, and recently, works have been tackling both of them in different scenarios. This work has shown perform boost in this regard, and the authors have solifdified their claims with extensive experiments. \n- Additionally, as the paper mentions, it can be integrated with any networks very easily further boosting the applicability of the method.\n- This work has potential to contribute significantly to the community.\n\nReferences:\n1.
