                "value": "When batch normalization (BN) is implemented in spiking neural network (SNN) structures, it is a common practice to compute the statistics across all time steps for running BN. However, this commonly used BN is ill-suited for the online training of SNNs. To enable BN for online training, this paper introduces two strategies called Online Spiking Renormalization (OSR) and Online Threshold Stabilizer (OTS), which preserve the online training property and memory efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods."

                "value": "1. If the reviewer understands the OTS method correctly, the threshold $\\theta[t]$ is dynamically adjusted for each sample batch during both the training and inference phases. However, the reviewer thinks that $\\theta[t]$ should be precalculated and fixed during the inference stage. Otherwise, the batch size will highly influence the performance. Much worsely, the obtained network cannot be implemented on normal neuromorphic chips because the chips do not support calculating the mean and variance. the reviewer suggests the authors to maintain a running $\\theta[t]$ used for inference.\n\n\n2. This paper could be regarded as an engineering work. Then the reviewer thinks that the ablation experiments are not abundant:\n (i). When OSR is incorporated individually, there appears to be a significant performance degradation. It is important to clarify whether such a phenomenon is typical across various datasets.\n (ii). A simpler approach to integrating BN into the online training regime involves calculating the statistics solely based on data from each time step. In this approach, at every time step during training, the normalized I[t] is computed based on $\\mu[t]$ and $\\sigma[t]$, as illustrated in eq. 8. Additionally, the running mean and variance are also updated at each time step. This vanilla BN method should be considered as the baseline. It would be valuable to assess whether this method outperforms OSR and whether the combination of the baseline with OTS outperforms the combination of OSR with OTS.\n (iii). In the backward stage, the authors utilize a \"double transformation\" trick to facilitate more meaningful backpropagation. What if we directly conduct bachprop based on the ``linear transformation''? Is OSR better than that?\n\n\nMinor:\n1. eq.2: $s^{l-1}[t]W^l$ -> $W^ls^{l-1}[t]$, eq.4: $u^{l} [t] (1-s^{l} [t] )$  -> $u^{l}[t] \\odot (1-s^{l}[t])$\n2. The ``Online Calculation of All-time Mean and Variance'' part appears somewhat trivial. The reviewer thinks that it might be unnecessary to include this information in the list of contributions. The audiences may expect a more significant contribution when such a detail is highlighted.\n3. The statement preceding Section 5: ``our OTS mechanism helps our OTS mechanism''."
