The reviewer is skeptical about the contribution, in that:\n    * The aggregation framework seems very artificial. There is not enough motivation why people would have the aggregation mapping $\\psi^{i \\to (n)}$ in hand *a priori*. Specifically, why don't people directly consider the aggregated MDP when they model real-world scenarios, but rather introduce a large-scale MDP and identifies the similarity between (unnecessarily differentiated) states in the meantime?\n    * Apart from the novel idea of substructures, the contribution of the second part seems minimal to the reviewer since it looks like a simple application of LSVI-UCB in sub-MDPs. The proof structure is also similar to that of LSVI-UCB with minor changes.\n    * The results will be very interesting if the aggregation structure can be learned (either online or offline) rather than given, but reviewer fails to come up with a quick fix that enables such learning. The reviewer would be more positive about this paper if the authors can, at least, illustrate a potential algorithm design idea to learn the structure.\n2. The comparison against LSVI-UCB seems sketchy. The authors claim in the abstract that $d_{\\psi}^3 N \\ll d^3$ is \"readily met in real-world environments\", but the only discussion about this is a few conjectured inequalities on page 9 without any real-world data. This seems like too much overclaiming to the reviewer, and thus the authors are urged to provide real-world evidence for their claim.\n3. The experiment design can be improved in the following ways:\n    * The source code to reproduce the results is not publicly available.\n    * The environment is designed to be tabular, which is reducible to linear MDPs, but only in a very inefficient way. The comparison is therefore unfair. It would be more convincing if the algorithms can be evaluated and compared in MDPs with intrinsic low-dimensional structures.\n    * The MDPs used in the experiment are very small in size. Experiments are expected to, at least, show adequate scalability of the algorithm."

                "value": "Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have spotlighted function approximation to address the generalization challenges in tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Linear MDP, a cornerstone model, has demonstrated that regret bounds are influenced more by feature dimension rather than state space size. However, the authenticity of this claim is examined in this paper. Researchers found that for appropriate representation of the probability space, the feature dimension is inevitably influenced by the size of the state space. A discrepancy was observed in the relationship between the feature dimension and state space size, especially as the latter expands. It's concluded that linear MDPs might not inherently allow learning detached from state space size. To counter this, the paper presents a new hierarchical framework called dynamics aggregation. It encompasses both state aggregation and equivalence mapping, promoting efficiency and adaptability. A hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) algorithm is proposed within this structure, which is statistically efficient and offers a comprehensive regret bound. The algorithm is validated against existing methods, showcasing its superior performance."

                "value": "1. The paper questions the widely accepted belief about linear MDPs, delivering a comprehensive critique of its fundamentals.\n  \n2. The new framework, which fuses state aggregation and equivalence mapping, holds promise for addressing the limitations of linear MDPs, making it a significant contribution to the field.\n\n3. The proposed HRL algorithm not only introduces an innovative approach to RL but is the first of its kind to provide proven guarantees in function approximation.\n\n4. The inclusion of numerical experiments fortifies the theoretical claims, showcasing the algorithm's efficacy against existing counterparts."

                "value": "1.For the proof provided for Theorem 1: suppose that there exists a state-action pair$(s, a)$ for which the transition probabilities are non-zero for more than $U$ states. How would this affect the recursive logic applied in the derivation of $\\operatorname{rank}(\\mathbb{P}_h) \\geqslant\\lfloor S / U\\rfloor$? Would the derived relationship between $d$, the rank of $\\mathbb{P}_h$, and the relationship $\\lfloor S / U\\rfloor$ still hold? \n\n2. Feature Dimension vs. State Space Size: Given that the research reveals a deeper connection between feature dimension and state space size than previously thought. What is potential future work especially in contexts where the state space is vast?\n\n3. Hierarchical Structures in Real-world Scenarios: With the proposed dynamics aggregation framework depending heavily on the hierarchical structure of problems, how feasible is it to identify or establish such hierarchies in complex, real-world scenarios, where the state dynamics might be more intricate and less structured?\n\n4. This paper mentions several examples in section 4. How does this method work and does it perform well in these examples?"
