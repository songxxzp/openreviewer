That issue is particularly fraught for ZPR, where the benchmark proposes to replace a manually annotated dataset with an automatically generated one. The same issue arises with a lack of reasons provided for using this dataset in comparison to existing long-form Chinese benchmark (Guan et al. 2022)\n- A number of these datasets dismiss relevant smaller high-quality datasets in exchange for automatically generated tasks, particularly in the context of the ZPR data.

(2020) -- https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.482.pdf). Do the authors have a suggestion for the reason for the dramatic difference in behavior across different Chinese ZP recovery tasks? Is the domain chosen particularly hard? \nWhat are the stars to the left of each figure? \nTable 1 caption says that\"\" means the number of instances (e.g. sentences, pairs or documents).\" -- what are the units for SI, ZPR and MRC? Quotations, implied pronouns, and questions, I assume? \nI was confused at the actual evaluation of the diagnostic task: are models simply evaluated regarding whether they assign higher probability to the correct discourse marker?  Why do the authors not use this task to evaluate any models? \nThe paper says their new MRC dataset \"contains rich discourse phenomena\", and is from \"more challenging\" domain, but doesn't provide any detail beyond document length. Could they provide any examples or analysis? \nSimilarly, they claim the NT task contains \"richer linguistic phenomena, especially in discourse.\", but again provide no detail: could they explain what they mean? \nThe authors claim that their \"Novel Translation\" dataset took 5,134 chapters in 152 books (Table 3 suggests it's 1.4 million units -- I assume sentences?) and they manually aligned it. Does that mean that the authors did millions of alignment annotations? If not, could they clarify their methodology?"

The paper does not provide any qualitative analysis that confirms the conclusions of the comparison results. Also, some of the results in Table 5 need to be explained or at least justified with a reasonable intuition. For example, why does Disco-Bench Pretraining significantly hurst ellipsis handling in the TC task? Also, Disco-Bench pretraining hurts most phenomena in the MRC task. The paper justifies that with \"understanding tasks are mostly classification tasks, whose signals may not be sufficient to guide models to learn discourse information\" which does not make sense since the continual pre-training phase is independent of the task!\n\n3.
