In blind docking the task is to predict the bounded structure of a ligand combined with a protein without additional information as for example potential protein pockets. The following paper extends the idea of DiffDock in the sense of reducing the docking task to a given protein pocket and therefore being able to increase the complexity by considering the flexibility of the amino acid side chains."

While I acknowledge that incorporating the flexibility of side chains is a new feature for DiffDock, it's important to note that this concept has already been included in other diffusion-based docking tools. For instance, NeuralPlex, although unfortunately not publicly available.\n\nAn intriguing and substantial contribution would have been if the authors had enhanced the PoseBuster benchmark, a topic they discuss in the appendix. From my perspective, it seems this was not the case.\n\nI still have some questions and therefore I am waiting for the rebuttal to give a definitive decision. Although, it is a thoroughly written paper with good results I am hesitant to accept the paper to ICLR due to in my opinion only a slight extension to DiffDock."

                "value": "1. The technical contribution is incremental. The paper mainly extands DiffDock\u2019s idea with sidechain prediction\n2. The paper claims that previous models like DiffDock only consider rigid receptor. However, this might be misleading as previous models incorporate just residue-level features, which do not utilize, and thus, do not need to incoorporate sidechain. The primary distinction is that DiffDock-Pocket extends DiffDock by adding sidechain prediction. Both models do not account for backbone flexibility, which should be clarified.\n3. The paper predominantly addresses site-specific docking, where the ground truth pocket is provided. A more comprehensive evaluation, including scenarios where the pocket is predicted by other models, would enhance the practical applicability of the findings.\n4. The method for curating the pocket center and selecting sidechains for modeling flexibility (within 3.5\u00c5 of any ligand) relies on the ligand's position, which could lead to potential data leakage. While the paper mentions that users will manually set these parameters during inference, further details and implications of this process need clarification.\n5. The significant improvement observed with in-silico structures generated by ESMFold2 might be attributed to additional training on this dataset. Further ablation studies are necessary when no in-silico structures are used for training.\n6. Previous work [1] has demonstrated that traditional methods like SMINA can achieve rapid inference speeds and high performance in docking when the pocket location is provided. The paper indicates that these traditional methods become significantly slower when sidechain flexibility is considered. A more comprehensive comparison, including performance and speed evaluations of traditional models with and without sidechain flexibility, would provide a more balanced and informative perspective.\n\n[1].
