                "value": "The paper finds that the existing feature-shaping methods usually employ rules manually designed for specific model architectures and OOD datasets, which consequently limit their generalization ability. To address this gap, the authors first formulate an abstract optimization framework for studying feature-shaping methods. then they propose a concrete reduction of the framework with a simple piecewise constant shaping function and show that existing feature-shaping methods approximate the optimal solution to the concrete optimization problem. Further, assuming that OOD data is inaccessible, the authors propose a formulation that yields a closed-form solution for the piecewise constant shaping function, utilizing solely the ID data. Through extensive experiments, the authors show that the feature-shaping function optimized by the proposed method improves the generalization ability of OOD detection across a large variety of datasets and model architectures."

Then, theta of ReAct [A] is also M dimension because ReAct conducts the operation on each element of feature z. theta of the proposed method is K dimension determined by the number of intervals. I am not sure whether it is possible to put the plots together.\n- theta is optimized over the proposed optimization problem that the closed form exists. However, other feature shaping methods [A, B] do not have the other parameters to be optimized.\n- Other feature shaping methods [A, B] said that their methods have comparable performance in distribution distribution after applying their methods.
