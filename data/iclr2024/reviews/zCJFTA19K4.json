This is an issue for use cases involving autocompletion, such as code generation. The authors propose a new decoding algorithm to handle partial tokens. The algorithm backtracks to a previous full token, then decodes the subsequent token while limited to only generating tokens that start with the partial token. This enables the model to use next-token predictions for complete tokens within its vocabulary, while ensuring that the resulting model output still aligns with the partially generated user input. The authors outline several classes of common partial token occurrences (e.g. natural language subwords, space prefixes, contiguous spaces in code) and construct evaluation data for testing generation from partial tokens for each class. They show that their backtracking algorithm improves performance across natural language and code generation datasets, with limited increased latency during decoding."

It is easy to implement for existing LLMs, so it could realistically be used and adapted by practitioners.

                "value": "**-- 1. Uncertainty around backtracking steps --**\n\nThe paper is somewhat unclear about the method of backtracking multiple tokens (B in Algorithm 1), so I would ask the authors to clarify this. The introduction mentions \u201cOur approach involves backtracking to the last complete tokens\u201d, which is how I understood the method initially. But later it is suggested that the method backtracks multiple tokens (B = 3 tokens), and not just one token back.\n\nI am not sure why backtracking 3 tokens would work better than 1, as found in the ablation study. Wouldn\u2019t that give the model less context unnecessarily, given that 1 token back is all we need to get to a complete token? \n\n**-- 2. More details on increased latency --**\n\nThe paper would be improved by a more detailed explanation of the increased computational complexity introduced by token alignment. I appreciate that the authors have included a whole subsection on this topic, but I would suggest shifting the focus of the subsection to matters that are practically informative. What is the average added latency, in ms and percentage? This is mentioned, but the authors should include the relevant hardware details for reference as well. Increased latency would be a primary real world concern for practitioners.\n\n**-- 3. Framing of the problem --**\n\nThe problem of partial tokens could be presented more accurately in some instances. For example, at the end of page 3 the authors suggest that subword tokens of linguistic words like \u201cbanana\u201d (\u201cbanan\u201d or \u201cbana\u201d) could lead to issues. I think it would be best to cite work on this, or prove this experimentally? Linguistically unsound subword tokenisations are present in every LLM, yet they work well in most cases, presumably because there is enough data for models to learn how these subwords combine to form words (e.g. on https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer the word \u201cbananas\u201d is segmented \u201cban-anas\u201d.)\n\nThe reported results could be viewed as proof that this is an issue, but for that it would be useful to include more examples of where token alignment helps e.g. can models autocomplete \u201cbana\u201d as \u201cbananas\u201d given sufficient context? Does token alignment allow them to do this?\n\nThe same holds for the other partial token categories."
