The paper first gives a broad overview of multivariate distributional forecasting metrics and identifies their failure modes. It then proposes the KNNS metric, motivated by the fact that out-of-sample likelihood would be a good score. The KNNS metric is then compared to baselines on synthetic and small-sized real world scenarios. \n\nHowever, the proposal appears to move from an incorrect premise. The metric itself appears rather complicated, difficult to implement in practice, and requires the correct tuning of hyperparameters--the choices of which may be data and model dependent. The experimental setup is not nearly enough to substantiate the introduction of a new forecast evaluation metric, and the results fail to demonstrate conclusive evidence."

It gives a broad overview and critique of previous evaluation methods used in other papers and identifies their failure modes. After introducing KNNS, it demonstrates an interesting link between random projections, energy scores and CRPS. The authors then use this insight to make the otherwise very compute-intensive KNNS metric somewhat manageable (computationally, albeit not statistically) in practice. \n\nThe paper also offers good insight about how the statistical power of a forecast evaluation metric was evaluated in prior literature, and proposes a new and thoughtful experiment setup. The authors are clear in their conclusions and about the limitations of their work."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Firstly, the paper moves from the premise that a metric used for model selection in forecasting must be able to correctly capture a variety of properties about forecasts including how much the forecasts exhibit correlation and temporal regularity. However, I would argue this is only true to the extent that it makes the metric more \"sample efficient\" with higher statistical power. \n\nWhile simple MAD, MSE, CRPS may be oblivious to correlations or regularity of forecasts, they reflect the key desiderata of the forecasts stemming from the task: that they are close to the ground truth. As the model is better able to capture correlations, one expects that simple metrics like MSE will also vanish. In other terms, one does not require metrics are highly representative---but that they are consistent and proper. For added complexity of metrics, one should argue that the metrics result in higher statistical power under realistic finite sample constraints and forecasting scenarios (realistic true distributions). Given the inconclusivity of the paper's empirical findings and the lack of a framework for the tuning of KNNS parameter I do not believe this bar has been cleared for KNNS.\n\nMy second critique would be on the metric itself. Motivated by kNN density estimation, the authors introduce the L2 distance to the kth nearest neighbor as the model selection metric, despite high dimensionality. Besides the fact that this could result in notoriously high sampling variance depending on the true data distribution, this makes the magnitude of the metric dependent on the size of the sample (in the paper, \"ensemble\"). i.e., in order to compare two models one would have to compare them on the same number of sampled trajectories or the metric would be invalid otherwise. \n\nFinally, the KNN score's intuition is that the best model is able to place a forecast close in L2 distance to the ground truth. Note that for a univariate forecast this is equivalent to saying that the k-th best forecast in an ensemble, measured in squared error, has low squared error. Setting k=1, this is equivalent to choosing the model with the \"best in hindsight\" MSE. In other words, KNNS does not appear to measure the quality of distributional forecasts, a desired property set out in the paper, but only point forecast error. \n\nSome other points\n\n- The introduction of the random projections could be better motivated. Multiple random projections sampled and with sufficient latent dimension would be justified for only very high dimensionality tasks such as spatiotemporal forecasting in earth sciences, etc. This doesn't appear to be the case with the experiment setup.\n- The introduction of KNNS is somewhat counterintuitive. The paper first reports that out of sample likelihood (i.e., perplexity) is a desirable metric; but due to its practicality immediately moves to KNN distance. I believe this link should be substantiated. \n- $d$ is redefined in the paper as 'difference' although interchangeably also used to denote dimensions. The notations $\\mathbb{y}$ and $\\mathbb{Y}$ (resp. X) also appear to have differing definitions through the paper."
