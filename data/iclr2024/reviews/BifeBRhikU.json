PB-LLM selectively identifies and designates a small fraction of salient weights for binarization, assigning them to higher-bit storage, and essentially implementing partial binarization. PB-LLM is extended to recover quantized LMMs' capabilities through post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). In PTQ, the Hessian matrix guides the reconstruction of binarized weights to restore reasoning capacity at low bits. In QAT, we freeze salient weights during training, derive optimal scaling factors to minimize quantization errors and propose a scaling mechanism for enhanced residual binarized weights. The result shows that PB-LLM achieves competitive results without losing performance gain."

Particularly, it outlines the limitations encountered when applying previous BNN works to LLMs, while proposing new methods from Post Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization Aware Training (QAT) for LLM low-bit weight quantization. Within PTQ, the paper utilizes Hessian information to identify element-wise salient weights, upon which 8-bit quantization is applied to preserve reasoning capacity in a pre-trained LLM, while binary (1-bit) quantization is applied to the un-salient weights. After applying mixed-quantization, it employs GPTQ to un-salient weights for further optimization (termed as GPTQ-PB). In QAT, the paper applies QAT during the LLM fine-tuning stage, utilizing 1) optimal scaling factor and 2) salient weight freezing methodology to bring about an efficient yet higher-performing QAT methodology (termed as PB-LLM). The methodologies studied and proposed in this work provide insightful contributions to the field of LLM binarization, showcasing the potential for further advancements in LLM binarization."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Major Concerns\n- Lack of novelty: The authors propose the optimal scaling factor as their primary contribution, but the core idea itself seems to have already been proposed in the previous work. For example, [R1] proposed an optimal ternary function (eq. (3) of [R1]), but it can be trivially reduced to the binary function when the threshold is zero; then the equation seems to be identical to the equation (8) and (9) proposed in this paper.\n\n[R1] Li te tal., Ternary Weight Networks\n\n\n- Lack of Evaluation Task: This paper evaluates the reasoning capability of LLM only through the accuracy of the CSQA task. In the CSQA task, tasks such as OBQA and ARC challenge were used for OPT-1.3B, where the FP performance did not reach even the random baseline (25%). It raises questions about the suitability of these tasks for demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning, and, hence, the superiority of PB-LLM. To show the effects of fine-tuning more clearly, it would be advisable to carefully select reasoning tasks that are appropriate for the model capacity. Reporting performance not just on CSQA, but also on multi-task accuracy like MMLU would be also beneficial for highlighting PB-LLM's efficacy.\n\n- Inconsistent Salient Weight Methodology between PTQ and QAT: The absence of a consistent methodology for salient weight protection between PTQ and QAT is concerning. While the effectiveness of using Hessian criteria for identifying salient weights in PTQ is demonstrated through performance comparisons, the rationale for using magnitude criteria to identify salient weights in QAT seems to be missing. Understanding the disparity in the approach to salient weight protection across PTQ and QAT is crucial for a holistic appreciation of the proposed method.\n\n- Insufficient evidence on PB-LLM efficiency: To claim that PB-LLM is more efficient in terms of training iteration number compared to LLM-QAT, a more thorough comparison seems necessary. Specifically, it needs to be clear whether the LLM-QAT, being compared with PB-LLM, has been fine-tuned on the same dataset as PB-LLM. Detailed experimental setup information regarding the LLM-QAT is required. Moreover, verification is needed on whether the results through PB-LLM QAT have fully enhanced the reasoning capacity of the pre-trained model. Essentially, it appears that the reasoning accuracy of the target model (OPT-1.3B) obtained through FP fine-tuning should be presented as the upper bound in Figure 7. Additionally, there seems to be a lack of information in Table 2 regarding whether FP LLaMA-7B performance is pre-trained or fine-tuned.\n\n\nMinor Concerns\n- Typo: Sec 3.3 bianrize -> binarize\n- Consistent notation should be used in Sec 4.1 -> LLaMA, LLaMa -> LLaMA\n- There may be an incorrect reference link in Sec 4.1, \"showing its fast convergence property (refer to 3.2)\" Should it possibly be corrected to \"refer to 3.4?\"\n- There are spacing issues in the Figure 7 caption, \"LLMin\" should be \"LLM in\" and \"PM-LLMtriumphs\" should be \"PB-LLM triumphs\"."
