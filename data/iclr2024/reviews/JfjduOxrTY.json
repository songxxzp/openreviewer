They show that expressiveness of the model depends only on the function of its adjacency and they empirically test this by removing self-attention (i.e. the entry-wise function) from one of the GT models  and still retaining its performance (prior to its modification). The authors also extend Ollivier-Ricci (OR) curvature to weighted directed graphs, thus defining Continuous Unified Ricci Curvature (CURC). They study the theoretical properties of CURC and leverage this in analyzing the shifts in curvature distribution for propagation graphs after training, for a number of graph learning models that can be cast as GPNNs."

Since it is a theoretical-style paper, the paper needs to improve its notation and clarification, and it's better to treat these parts like math.\nFor the definition of adjacency function f, In section 3.2, 'it is a mapping from A to... ', so it is a mapping from R^{n^2} to R^{n^2 \\times d}. But when referring to Appendix A1, it mentions some function that maps over some tensor power space from R^{n^p \\times d} to R^{n^k \\times d}. It seems that the adjacency function is a function on input with features, i.e., R^{n^2 \\times d}. I am confused about which one should be.\n\n2. The paper would be improved if it talked about why we chose Ricci curvature (generalized or not) as a measurement to explore the graph. In geometry, Ricci curvature is a degrade of Riemann curvature, while it is enough to characterize two-dimensional manifolds.\n\n3. (Section 4.2, definition 4.2, d^{\\epsilon} and (8)) The definition of CURC is questionable, which lies in the so-call asymmetric metric function. As a curvature to measure the curvedness of a manifold (in our case, a graph), its definition should be based on distance (or, say, metric) satisfying positivity, symmetry and triangle inequality. But CURC is based on an asymmetric metric function (which is not a metric), which means the metric could be different from u to v or v to u, which in turn means that the curvature from u to v could be more curved or less curved than the reverse. But CURC is defined as a scale, which contradicts the above. \n\n4. The paper would be improved if it elaborated more on the implications of CURC, KR duality in section 4.3. It is hard to follow the terminology and abstract indications.\n\n5. The definition of a generalized propagation network is more of a rewrite of a graph network with an adjacency function that incorporates propagation and feature mapping (there is still some ambiguity, as I mentioned in the first point). It is more on the conveniences to bring out the notion of curvature."
