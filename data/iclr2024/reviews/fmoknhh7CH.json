As for novelty of methods, to design the residue types of the binding site, it generated both discrete and continuous variables under the framework of flow matching. \n3. Many reasonable tricks are used to improve the performance, such as harmonic prior and structure self-conditioning.\n4.

One critical question is that how fundamentally different multi-ligand docking is from protein-ligand docking (the existing methods). \nIf they are different, then one question is that the authors compared HarmonicFlow with DiffDock, but they are solving different problems: one for multi-ligand docking and the other for protein-ligand (both single- and multi-ligand) docking. Why their numbers can be compared to each other?\nIf they are the same in terms of the method, then HarmonicFlow is not the first DL method that can handle multi-ligand docking.\n\n- Does this vector field $u$ in Eq 1 have any physical meaning?\n\n- Can authors help summarize the essential difference between score matching / denoising diffusion with the objective (Eq 1&3) in this paper? Because score matching and denoising diffusion can be treated as ODE flow models. Also, is the proposed HarmonicFlow specific for multi-ligand docking? Now it seems that it can also fit for the general protein-ligand docking.\n\n- Many baselines, such as the related works mentioned in Sec 2, are missing in the experiments."

Why do you think that the quality of docking tells much about the quality of side-chain prediction (DiffDock can perform this task without this information)? Moreover, for me, it is not fair to compare FlowSite with a blind docking algorithm in a site-specific setting.\n2. In Q2, you compare the ground truth amino acids with the predicted ones. Is it a fair surrogate metric for de novo generation, when for a given set of ligands and backbone coordinates there potentially can be many different answers? An algorithm that can generate pockets with a better binding affinity than affinity of pockets from the dataset, will have a low score.\n3. The output of the flow-matching model should also depend on the sampled initial conditions. In Q2 experiments, do you consider a single run of the noise sampling? Have you tried to sample many different noise vectors and compare the outputs?\n4. You said that it is not feasible to estimate the energy. Why? I suppose that the energy of the designed protein and the affinity of the complexes can be somehow estimated using traditional or machine learning methods. At least, it is possible to use the all-atoms confidence model from DiffDock and compare scores of complexes.\n5. In many experiments, you mentioned the oracle method that has access to the ground truth ligand structure. What exactly is this method?\n6. How much time does it take to train your model on PDBBind and MOAD?"
