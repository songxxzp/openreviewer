                "value": "1.\tOn the conceptualization of this work. From the bottom of my heart, I like the topic this paper discusses. But since it concerns physics understanding, the description of physics should have a high standard, at least, the very basic concept should be coherent:\n\na.\tIn Intro \u2013 Second Paragraph. The examples given for humans are very irrelevant to the \u201csoft body\u201d, the topic of this paper. For the liquid example, it can demonstrate the density, but for the pulley example, which physics parameters are the humans trying to distinguish? Moreover, humans can distinguish these physics properties do no means AI models can, so there is a logic leap between the human examples to \u201cHowever, it remains an \u2026\u201d\n\nb.\tFrom this paragraph on, I notice that the paper has a confusing meaning of \u201csoft body\u201d, how is liquid a type of soft body? According to Wikipedia (Soft-body dynamics - Wikipedia), it should be a solid object at least. Yes, I can find more rigorous sources (e.g. a textbook), but I think a simple checkup on Wikipedia can avoid such concept mistakes.\n\nc.\tAccording to Section 3 Dataset, the paper mentions physical properties: mass, friction, elasticity, density, deformability, and stretchiness.\nFirst, there\u2019s a difference between the physical properties a physics simulator can simulate and a property with genuine physics meaning. Sometimes the physics simulator just combine many underlying physics process and expose some high-level properties for the game developer or artist to control. Here is exactly the case. For example, physically speaking, elasticity and stretchiness are both two types of deformability. I wonder how they can be put at the same level. Besides, stretchiness and deformability are both parameters without corresponding basic physics meaning, which means you cannot measure them in the real world. How would the authors measure the stretchiness of cloth from the real world, as is the method of measurement coherent with what\u2019s inside the physics engine? Besides, for soft body objects, there are more physics properties to influence the deformation such as plasticity, viscosity, etc.\n\n2.\tOn the writing: The pie charts of Fig 3 and Fig 5-7 do not give precise ratio numbers. The labels of the sections of the pie charts are not clear enough. Take Fig 3 for example, it has \u201cMass\u201d, \u201cMass Change\u201d, and \u201cMass Goal\u201d, then why it does not have \u201cShape\u201d, \u201cShape Change\u201d, or \u201cShape Goal\u201d, if the shape is not a physical property, then why no \u201cTension\u201d, \u201cTension Change\u201d, \u201cTension Goal\u201d. A similar confusion goes for Fig 5-7.\n\n3.\tOn the dataset: The number of videos is not large. A potential reason is the lack of variance in the scene setup. The soft body can deform in infinite ways, how can a 500-video dataset satisfy the coverage of dynamics?\n\n4.\tOn the experiments: Will the model train on the proposed dataset be generalized to real-world videos? Or is there any potential way the paper aims for real-world physics reasoning?"
