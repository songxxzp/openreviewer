It is not clear nor obvious how the Occam's razor concept can be rigorously formulated in (or satisfied by) a neural clustering objective. As was done in Tsitsulin et al. 2023, the authors should formally argue how their objective avoids the collapse condition (all nodes in singleton clusters or in the unity cluster).\n\n(3) The authors claim that a contribution of their approach is the ability to return overlapping cluster assignments. However, this is true of any neural clustering method with soft clustering assignments, including that of Tsitsulin et al. 2023. Can the authors compare the results in Fig 2 with those obtained by DMoN? If those obtained by NeuroMAP appear better, intuitive explanation of the improvement should also be stated."
