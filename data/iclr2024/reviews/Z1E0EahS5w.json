            "questions": {
                "value": "I will detail some of my confusions (and my resolutions to these confusions below) before asking more pointed questions.\n\nIn Dambre et. al.'s work, the capacity $C_T[y]$ is defined with respect to the\nfunction (rephrased using the present notation) $y(t) = z(U^{-h}(t))$, where $z$\nis some real-valued function *on the input history*, and the vector of\nobservables $Y$ is *implicitly determined by $U^{-h}(t)$* (These bold phrases\nwere not clear upon an initial reading of this paper). Intuitively, the capacity\nis a measure of the ability reconstruct the function $z(U^{-h}(t))$ using some\nlinear combination of observables $Y$ over $T$ steps.\n\nSince $C_T[y]$ is *data-dependent*, this quantity makes sense in general only if\nwe some probability distribution over $U^{-h}(t)$ that we have defined (Dambre\net. al. consider i.i.d. $u(t)$, and the present paper defines input as a\nstochastic random variable). In Equation 8 of the referenced work, this explicit\ndependence on data implies that the definition of IPC is such that the capacity\nis summed over different functions *on the same data* (this fact is not made\nimmediately clear in the present work).\n\nI was also initially confused by the lack of clarity regarding the inner product\nbetween \"basis functions\" $y_l$: this inner product technically depends on the\ndynamics of the system and the inputs, as noted by Dambre et. al, while the\npresent work appears to elide this point. The value of $n$ in Equations (5) and\n(7) further confuses this issue, since $n$ was earlier used to represent the\nnumber of internal degrees of freedom, not the number of orthogonal observables\nof the system.\n\nA major question I stumbled on was why we should believe that it is possible,\neven in the absence of noise, for IPC of $2^n$ using the products of $n$\nindependent, bit-valued degrees of freedom. I did not and still do not\nunderstand the example given in the first paragraph of Section 4, but I believe\nI partially resolved this issue for myself:\n\nI understand that each $x_{k} \\colon U^{-h}(t) \\to {0, 1}$ for $k \\in [n]$\nrepresents a single degree of freedom of the system. I also understand that\n$U(t)$ is formulated as continuous and $m$-dimensional. In the limit of $h \\to\n\\infty$, it makes intuitive sense that the $2^n$ products of the $n$ degrees of\nfreedom could be reliably distinguished in the case that the expected dynamics\nof the system provide for unique probability densities for each combination of\nbits.\n\n## Q1 \nMy remaining question on this point is whether deterministic systems subject to\nthe constraints of Definition 6 (characterizing circuit complexity of the\nsystem) also have exponential capacity. That is, is it inherently the\nstochasticity that limits the IPC of the system, or is it the limits on\ndynamical complexity, or are both required?\n\n## Q2\nIf the central claim is that the introduction of *noise* reduces IPC to\nsubexponential while the deterministic case is exponential (with or without the\ncircuit complexity assumption) I would expect a clear limiting case to be\nestablished by which the limit of zero noise in the stochastic setting recovers\nexponential capacity. Is this limiting case evident from the results of this paper?\n\n## Q3\nFinally, as a separate question, are the authors aware of treatments of\nreservoir computers that relate IPC to characterizations of the underlying\ndynamical system via the Koopman operator? Intuitively, I get the impression\nthat there are connections here that may be useful."

I would therefore have expected a better motivation for the particular choice, and an explanation what specifically is being measured early on in the paper.\n\nThe most widely used reservoir computing approach are Echo State Networks (Jaeger 2001), these are determinstic recurrent reservoirs. The work here appears to be concerned with stochastic reservoirs, in my view this choice is interesting but should be reflected in the title of the paper, but it not even mentioned in the abstract, and only in passing in the introduction.\n\nI also find the title less informative than it could be, because it is not clear what limits are being investigated. For example there has been prior work on information processing and the memory capacity of echo state networks (eg Boedecker et al, 2012; Barancok et al, 2014). These approaches use information theoretic measurements. Other measures that are typically used for reservoir computing approaches are investigations of the spectral radius, or Lyapunov exponents (and their connection to other dynamical systems).\n\nI find it difficult to see how the work helps in characterising the capability of a reservoir-based approach. In general, the capacity will increase as the number of neurons / basis-functions increases. The text and/or the chosen metric (IPC) in the work didn't help me to understand what the goal is, to either perfectly reproduce (memorize) a given signal, or to predict a given dynamical system based on some of its observations.\n\nThere appears to be only little coherent connections between the individual sections of the work and I find it hard to follow the logical flow in the work, or between the equations in the work. As a result, it is also hard to see what is the exact contribution of the work, and how it applies to research in reservoir computing methods.\n\nThe references are rather old and quite\tincomplete."
