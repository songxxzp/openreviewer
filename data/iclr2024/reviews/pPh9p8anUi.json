The method is a single-stage approach that adopts the popular center-based detection architecture. To correlate a subject and multiple detected body parts, a common approach is to estimate center offsets from each body center to the underlying body part. But this may be ineffective since in case of occlusion/close interaction multiple body centers may point to the same body part. Therefore, this paper proposes to simultaneously estimate the offset of the body part position from the detected body part toward the center of the subject. This means that instead of estimating center-to-part offsets, estimating part-to-center offsets for each detected body part will avoid ambiguities in close interaction situations. The proposed method greatly improves the performance of hand association in BodyHands."

The proposed method can achieve significant performance improvements in hand association on BodyHands. This demonstrates the interesting insight that the position of the hand is more ambiguous than the position of the center of the body. Because more occlusion/interaction occurs in the hand area."
