What I mean is that it is not enough to just state the words of \"white-box, black-box\" and so on, but one needs to have a discussion about what exactly these mean in the EBM case.\n\nFor example, it is somewhat clear from the early in the paper that the free phase of the inference may have gradient-masking behavior, but this was never discussed early on (and it is not enough to just say \"we did white-box attacks\", which in fact is actually already different from previous definitions of \"white-box attacks\"), and only until quite later in the experiments, we have an actual paragraph of \"gradient obfuscation\".\n\nIn other words, one should lead with a discussion specifically about how we attacked EBM, and be very clear about the inference stage issues. That will make the paper stronger.\n\nAside from that, while I do like the topic in this paper, the technical content seems to be a somewhat straightforward evaluation of EBM. They are good to know definitely, but the contributions are somewhat still limited."

What is the loss term that is used?\n    - Is Temporal Projected Gradient Descent (TPGD) in Appendix 8.2 the attack used for EBM? If so, the authors should present this in the main body of the paper.\n2. EBM itself should be described in more detail.\n    - How do EBMs make predictions? This detail is needed to understand how to perform gradient-based adversarial attacks on EBM.\n    - How costly are EBMs compared to the traditional models? This information is needed to justify the simple model architecture used in experiments.\n3. The model architecture (four convolutional layers followed by a fully connected layer) is too simple. Is this because of the expensive computation cost of EBM? How do you know that the findings will generalize to more complex architecture?"

Probably, it would be better to use a dataset that such semantic changes are more visible. For example, I\u2019m curious about the changes from attacking EP-CNN trained on MNIST or a dataset containing face images.\n3. Minor comments\n    - To add an appendix, you should use `\\appendix` command in LaTeX.\n    - Consider making EP-CNN results more visible in the plot. For example, make other lines thinner in the plot, so that you can emphasize EP-CNN results. Also, it is better to render EP-CNN results after rendering other lines so that the other lines are now drawn over the EP-CNN results."

However, I am unclear how the weights $w_n$ are updated based on Equations 4-6 related to the states $s^{n-1}$ and $s^{n+1}$. Can there be more explanation?\n3. As mentioned in the limitation, ``EP is relatively sensitive to the hyperparameters used to train the model as well as the seed used to initialize the weights``. Are there some heuristic rules to set the hyperparameters and the weights' initialization?\n4. Some editorial issues (just listed a few):\n- Better not to use contractions such as ``didn't``, ``don't``, ``weren't``.\n- It is a bit strange that there are the right brackets after BP-CNN and AdvCNN, respectively, but not the right bracket after ViT in Section 4.1.1.\n- A missing period ``.`` after the second paragraph in Section 4.1.1.\n- Inconsistent representations when referring to figures.
