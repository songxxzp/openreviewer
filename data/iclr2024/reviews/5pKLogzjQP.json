                "value": "When studying unlearnable examples, it seems that nowadays people are using three terms: \"unlearnable examples\", \"availability attacks\" and \"indiscriminate attacks\" interchangeably. I am not totally against it, but I think the authors need to be extra careful when specifying the threat model they are considering. \n\nTo illustrate more, availability attack is a generally broader definition. For example, in Biggio et al., 2012 and the following works, availability attacks refer to data poisoning attacks that aim to decrease the model performance overall. Specifically, an attacker usually injects poisoned points into the clean training set to achieve such a goal. Later, Huang et al., 2021 propose another type of availability attack that perturbs the entire training set, which is a data protection technique, also known as unlearnable examples. Obviously, these two types of attacks are very different in terms of the attack budget and attack purpose. I guess \"perturbation availability poison\" (in the title) seems to be a good definition, but I suggest the authors use a similar explicit definition throughout the paper.\n\nIn summary, I encourage the authors to revisit the literature on availability attacks, explicitly identify the threat model they are considering, and specify it in Section 2 while respectively discussing other works (e.g., other data poisoning attacks: targeted attacks, backdoor attacks, and especially indiscriminate attacks). Specifically, sentences like the following one need to be rewritten to reflect the true progress of this field:\n> In the realm of DNNs, the majority of existing research\nhas primarily concentrated on backdoor attacks. However, there has been a growing interest in\navailability attacks, also named unlearnable examples, prompting the exploration to prevent unauthorized model training. \n\nHere, the claim is not supported by any reference and is simply not true: there are numerous other poisoning attacks considering DNNs. Also, the second sentence is not accurate, see my arguments above."

Experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and a subset of ImageNet, and compare against training-time defenses and pre-training techniques, against a number of poisoning attacks. Results show that the disentangled perturbations are indeed poison patterns, and that training on the reconstructed base images is less degraded than the baselines."

From Figure 1, it looked like it was vaguely doing the right thing, but was better for some (OPS, LSP) than others (NTGA). As such, Section 4.2 was helping in showing that the disentangled poison patterns are in fact quite effective. However, I still think it\u2019d be interesting to quantify how far off the disentangled perturbations are from what the actual poison pattern is (or at least visualize the residuals); this would help answer whether the model is actually doing disentanglement, or itself somehow learning to produce orthogonal poison patterns.\n\n## S2. Main results: Clean Test Accuracy\nThe paper includes experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, comparing the proposed D-VAE approach with a number baselines, defending against a variety of attack types. There also additional results on other model architectures and with larger bounds. These results are pretty thorough, and the proposed approach consistently outperforms the baselines, sometimes by fairly large margins.\n\n## S3. Ablation Study\nThe ablation study on the two-stage procedure for this method is good for illustrating that both stages are important for purification."

                "value": "# W1. Motivation, necessity\na) Viability: How likely is it for the attacker to get enough poisoned samples into the training data? What percentage of the training data needs to be poisoned for their attack to succeed? Section 5.1 seems to imply that the main results poisoned *all* of the data, which is an extremely unrealistic assumption. In most scenarios, even one fifth of the data, which is the lower limit of the experiments in Table 7+8 is unrealistic.\\\nb) If the availability poisoning attack succeeds, then the trained model will very obviously have low performance, as can be seen in the papers. It would seem this is enough to alert the model trainer that something is wrong, leading to an inspection of the data (see below).\\\nc) Can poisoned data be detected more simply? For example, if there\u2019s a loss spike, simply toss out the sample rather than try to reconstruct the original image. Particularly for large foundation models (which seem to be the most vulnerable to inadvertently incorporating a poisoned sample), recent trends toward focusing on higher quality data and common practices of checkpoint restarts when losses spike would seem to defeat this attack already, without requiring a method like the one proposed here.\n\n# W2. Computation requirements\nThis method requires running a D-VAE on every sample, since it\u2019s not known ahead of time which samples are poisoned. This would require a not insignificant amount of computation, especially in the large model setting, which is where ingesting large amounts of online data is most likely. In particular, in Section 3.5, it is proposed (rather heuristically) to run D-VAE twice, which makes it even more expensive. This also requires additional hyperparameter tuning, to tune both KLD limits, which from the \u201cModel Training\u201d paragraph, seem to vary between datasets. In comparison, JPEG compression is more or less \u201cfree\u201d, as images are commonly stored in a compressed format anyway.\n\n# W3. Technical notation\nThe technical notation used throughout this paper doesn\u2019t meet the rigor expected of an academic publication. Numerous terms are used without proper introduction and are sometimes described confusingly, and there are a number of naming collisions and entities with multiple variables defined:\n- Eq 3: ${kld}_{limit}$ isn\u2019t defined. \n- Eq 3: $z$ isn\u2019t defined in the text.\n- Eq 4: x_c was previously used to denote clean data, but here it\u2019s being described as a predictive feature. Also, the subscript on x was previously used to denote the sample index i.\n- Eq 4: $x = (x_c , x^t_s)$ <= The right side is later described as being predictive and non-predictive features, but $x$ is the input in the image space. Why are they being introduced as a paired element? Also, what is $t$? \n- $D$ overloaded: In Figure 1 and Algorithm, $D$ denotes the decoder. In Proposition 2, D is the dimension of the Gaussian. In Equation, we have $D_{KL}$ for KL-Divergence (in contrast to KLD in Eq 3+14). In Section 3.5, D is used to refer to a poisoned dataset, as well as individual images that the input is subtracted from.\n- What is the notation for the clean and poisoned dataset? In Equation 1, it appears to be $\\mathcal D$ and $\\mathcal T$, but in Section 4.2 it\u2019s $C$ and $D_p$. Algorithm 1 also uses its own notation.\n\n# W4. Writing\nI encourage the authors revisit the writing. Many sections don\u2019t read very smoothly, and I oftentimes had to re-read paragraphs multiple times to parse what was being said. Some of this has to do with a number of small grammatical or idiomatic errors, or typos (see Miscellaneous for a few non-exhuastive examples), but more of it had to do with the way concepts are introduced. For example, it\u2019s not clear what part of the broad landscape of adversarial examples field this paper is going to be on until pretty deep into the Introduction, and my understanding of whether this paper was discussing a malicious method flipped back and forth multiple times.\n\n## Miscellaneous:\n- Title, throughout the paper: The regular use of \u201cPoisons\u201d throughout this paper is strange to me. \u201cPoison\u201d generically refers to a substance, and not something countable or discrete, as data samples are. Terms like \u201cPoison attacks\u201d to refer to the methodologies or \u201cPoisoned samples\u201d to refer to individual perturbed samples makes more sense.\n- pg 1: Datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet should be cited the first time they\u2019re introduced.\n- pg 2: \u201cunlearnale\u201d \n- Figure 2: \u201cLoss more information\u201d <= \u201cLose\u201d\n- Figure 2: It\u2019s not clear what Figure 2a is showing. The 3 methods shown haven\u2019t been introduced, as far as I can tell, none of the lines necessarily correspond with \u201cthe paper\u2019s method\u201d.\n- pg 4: \u201cobtain the restored learnable tainted samples\u201d <= Isn\u2019t the goal to reconstruct the underlying image so it\u2019s no longer \u201ctainted\u201d? The images already come \u201ctainted\u201d.\n- Section 4.2: $\\hat{D}_p$ appears multiple times with the $p$ not being subscripted.\n- Table 1: \u201cIn fact, it manages to achieve an even superior attacking performance than the original poisoned dataset in most instances with less amplitude.\u201d <= This info doesn\u2019t seem to present in Table 1, or anywhere else in Section 4.2?\n- Appendix Table 11: not centered\n- Appendix Fig 4: Adversarial patterns are inherently designed to be close to imperceptible, which makes it really challenging to tell the difference between the bottom 3 rows. Is it possible to show some sort of differential instead?"

In Section 3.1, $\\mathbf{x}$ represents the clean data, while in the rest of the paper, it represents the poisoned data.\n- I'm really confused about the proposed method. It would be helpful if the authors could provide more information in Section 3.2. Specifically, please give a detailed description and analysis of Figure 2. The current version is hard to understand, to me.\n- I'm confused about the poison recovering part in Eq. 14 and Figure 1. It seems the first two items in Eq.14 are contradictory. Are you aiming to decrease the L2 error between the reconstruction error and a tensor output by the network? I cannot understand the meaning of this term, to me.\n\nPlease clarify these points."
