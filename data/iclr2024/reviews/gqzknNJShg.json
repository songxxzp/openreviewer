                "value": "The presented method works in a specific setting of resource-constrained deep learning. The authors propose to replace the first trainable encoding block of common architectures with a manually crafted frequency-separating module. Namely, a discrete Fourier transform is applied to the input image, and the obtained frequencies are separated into several bands. Afterward, the bands are transformed into the spatial space again with the help of the inverse Fourier transform. The outputs are concatenated channel-wise and serve as an input for the neural network.\n\nThe method is evaluated both on a common classification task (with a limited number of data points per class) and on few-show class-incremental learning (FSCIL). As reported, the proposed module works better than recent augmentation strategies developed for full-scale ImageNet training such as AugMix, RandAugment, and Deep AutoAugment."

The authors clearly describe the motivation for their approach, and the description of the method is also easy to understand. \nThe proposed approach seems to improve the quality by a significant margin in some cases, e.g. for the ImageNet subset with 100 images per class, the accuracy is twice that of the baseline model (Tab. 1). Taking into account the simplicity of the method, this is an interesting result."

                "value": "1. Separating the frequency bands of the network input is not novel per se: for example, it is used from time to time in generative modeling, see e.g. [1], [2]. However, usually, it is done with the help of wavelets. I recommend adding this baseline to the comparison, namely, decomposing the input image with two or three iterations of discrete wavelet transform before feeding the result to the network.\n1. The authors compare their method with a number of other Fourier-based methods (Appendix C.2.3) and conclude that those methods do not perform well in their settings because they were specifically designed for medical image processing. It would be great to evaluate the proposed FourierAugment method on the medical data to demonstrate if it is competitive in that field since medical image processing often suffers from a limited amount of data.\n1. Minor remarks:\n    1. I find the name of the method, i.e. *FourierAugment*, misleading since it is just a way to present exactly the same information which the image contains, in a different way. In addition, it is deterministic, not random. This contradicts the way the word *augmentation* is typically used by the community nowadays.\n    1. Fig. 2 contains too much empty space and does not tell a lot of useful information. For example, the horizontal axis is not very informative since there is nothing unexpected in the training dynamics, and the whole figure may be replaced with a table reporting the final performance.\n\n[1] Hoogeboom et al. simple diffusion: End-to-end diffusion for high-resolution images.
