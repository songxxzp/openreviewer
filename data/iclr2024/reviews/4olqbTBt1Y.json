                "value": "### Summary:\nThe paper introduces a novel exploration approach for reinforcement learning (RL) called Dream Dual Structured Exploration (DREAM). The main focus is to address the challenges of efficient exploration in sparse reward environments.\n\n#### Key Contributions:\n1. **Dual Structured Exploration:** The authors propose a two-pronged exploration strategy. The first component involves traditional intrinsic motivation where agents receive rewards for novel behaviors. The second component is a \"dream\" mechanism, where agents hallucinate or simulate possible future scenarios to guide their exploration.\n  \n2. **DREAM Model:** This model is central to the paper. It's a generative model that simulates future trajectories based on the agent's past experiences. By imagining potential future outcomes, the agent can better decide where to explore next. This approach aims to improve exploration efficiency, especially in environments where rewards are sparse and hard to find.\n  \n3. **Empirical Evaluation:** The authors validate the effectiveness of DREAM through a series of experiments in various RL environments. The results demonstrate that DREAM outperforms several state-of-the-art exploration strategies, especially in challenging sparse-reward settings.\n\n4. **Scalability and Flexibility:** The DREAM approach is shown to be scalable and can be combined with other RL algorithms. This adaptability makes it a promising tool for a wide range of applications."

Originality:\nThe paper introduces several original concepts and techniques that add value to the domain of reinforcement learning (RL) exploration.\n\n- **Dual Structured Exploration:** The combination of traditional intrinsic motivation and a \"dream\" mechanism is a unique and innovative approach. While intrinsic motivation is a well-established concept in RL, the idea of agents simulating or hallucinating future scenarios (dreaming) to guide their exploration is a fresh take on the exploration challenge.\n  \n- **DREAM Model:** The generative model that simulates future trajectories based on past experiences is a novel concept. It effectively bridges the gap between traditional exploration techniques and forward-thinking strategies, allowing agents to anticipate potential outcomes.\n\n#### 2. Quality:\nThe paper demonstrates high quality in both its theoretical constructs and empirical evaluations.\n\n- **Theoretical Foundation:** The underlying principles of the DREAM model and dual structured exploration are well-justified and rooted in established RL concepts.\n  \n- **Empirical Evaluation:** The experiments conducted are comprehensive, covering multiple RL environments. The results not only validate the efficacy of the DREAM approach but also provide insights into its potential advantages over other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n#### 3. Clarity:\nThe paper is well-structured and presents its concepts in a clear and organized manner.\n\n- **Presentation:** The flow of the paper, from introducing the problem to detailing the solution and its evaluation, is logical and easy to follow.\n  \n- **Figures and Diagrams:** The included visual aids, such as graphs and flowcharts, effectively complement the textual content, aiding in the understanding of the proposed concepts and results.\n\n- **Mathematical Formulations:** The mathematical representations and formulations, particularly those related to the DREAM model, are clearly articulated. While they require a foundational understanding of RL, they are accessible to the target audience.\n\n#### 4. Significance:\nThe contributions of this paper have considerable significance in the domain of RL exploration.\n\n- **Addressing a Crucial Challenge:** Efficient exploration in sparse reward environments is a longstanding challenge in RL. The DREAM approach offers a potential solution, making it a valuable contribution to the field.\n  \n- **Scalability and Flexibility:** The adaptability of the DREAM approach, which can be combined with other RL algorithms, broadens its applicability and potential impact. This adaptability implies that DREAM could be foundational for future RL research and applications.\n\n- **Potential for Further Research:** The concepts introduced open up avenues for further exploration, refinement, and application in other RL scenarios or even beyond RL."

However, the problem studied is no difference with the existing open-world graph classification, such as [1], where the task is to classify each unlabeled graph example into either one of the known classes or a corresponding novel class. Moreover, it also closely resembles the open-world graph learning works like [2,3], where the learning goal is to classify nodes belonging to seen classes into correct groups, but also classify nodes not belonging to existing classes to an unseen class. The paper lacks a thorough review of related literature. In addition to open-world graph works, fields such as (graph) OOD detection is also closely related and should be discussed in the related works.\n\n2. Following the above point, the experiments should include open-world graph learning related baselines. Currently only general graph classification methods are compared.\n\n3. The method design include a lot of modules but lack support and motivations. Why is the attention mechanism necessary for aggregation? Why can the graph-of-graph design generate plausible cross-domain virtual features? For the objective why are $L_S, L_T, L_{DA}$ added without weights? The overall method seems complex and farraginous and unclear why it works.\n\n\n\n[1] RIGNN: A Rationale Perspective for Semi-supervised Open-world Graph Classification\n\n[2] Openwgl: Open-world graph learning\n\n[3] Open-World Lifelong Graph Learning"
