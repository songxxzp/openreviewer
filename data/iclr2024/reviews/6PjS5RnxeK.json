The authors argue that, based on empirical evidence, the large (outlying) eigenvalues of the Gauss-Newton matrix determine those of the Hessian (curvature) and the spectrum of the Gauss-Newton matrix is in turn determined by the extreme singular values of the input-output Jacobians. So to understand the progressive sharpening phenomenon and better generalization with flat curvature it makes sense to analyze the input-output Jacobian norm. The authors\u2019 theoretical contributions explain progressive sharpening, the connection between the Lipschitz norm of a neural network, its input-output Jacobian, and its generalization gap for the given input distribution assumptions. Through numerical experiments the authors also demonstrate how the Jacobian norm is correlated to sharpness and the generalization gap in practice and how different regularization approaches such as label smoothing, weight decay, sharpness aware minimization, data augmentation, learning rate changes etc. impact generalization gap, Jacobian norm and sharpness. The theoretical approach in the paper is compatible with the view that loss flatness does not generally imply generalization because of possible reparameterization (the Dinh et al reference)."

                "value": "- **The Ansatz is pretty crude and the overall narrative overly simplistic:** The authors themselves admit the lack of rigour in the ansatz, but frankly, there is a lot of hand-waving that is going on throughout the paper. Whatever does not fit the bill is assigned crudely to the other non Jacobian terms in the Gauss-Newton, and that too is done pretty sloppily by just showing the behaviour of individual terms on their own, rather than their interaction which is what matters. Essentially, this lack of even a basic quantitative attribution can be traced to the crudeness of the hypothesis. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Theoretical results are fairly simple and lack any evaluation:** There is nothing significant going on in here that is totally novel; a lot of it is based on past works and the rest seems fairly simple massaging of terms and inequalities here and there. The nature of the theoretical results, like Theorem 5.1, 6.1 which are hard to even evaluate numerically, casts a doubt upon their utility and perhaps suggests even the vacuousness of the bounds. Despite all of this, several statements in the paper sloppily attribute empirical observations to their theoretical results, ignoring the fact that many of the results are just pure one-sided bounds which are insufficient to explain phenomena (like progressive sharpening). Other statements are merely speculative, like that about the exceptional decrease in the Jacobian norm in Figure 4. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Unconvincing empirical results**: The presented experiments are interesting, but fail to be sufficiently convincing. \n\n   - (a) Figure 1 only shows a very short duration in training and when considered over the entire course of training (Figure 29) the relationship becomes flimsy. Even over the initial short duration, this relation is not as clean, as can be seen in Figures 8 - 12. Further, scales of the Jacobian norm and that of Hessian sharpness get pretty far apart for non-zero label smoothing. \n\n    - (b) Likewise the particular curves of the generalization gap and the sharpness or Jacobian in Figures 2 and 5 do not give a firm support for their claims. Comparing results across different learning rate values does not give a clear picture of the trend (e.g., looking at fixed values of weight decay in Figure 2, one would doubt if sharpness and Jacobian are even sufficiently capturing generalization). This makes me wonder about what are the actual correlation coefficients rather than just seeing a rough pictorial correlation. Similarly, the Jacobian norm increase midway in Figure 5 also seems a bit weird and the actual correlation seems unclear. Except for the case of the lowest learning rate, the rest of the scenarios are not convincing --- but then one of the selling points of the paper was explaining the generalization benefits of an initially large learning rate!\n\n   - (c) Then the batch size experiments have probably been run for a fixed number of epochs, resulting in less updates when a bigger batches are used, and thus could be a potential confounder in the results. What happens when compared across number of updates, instead of epochs on the x-axis? Besides, it's good that the training loss is shown, but it would make more sense to compare the gradient norm of the loss to compare their relative extents of convergence. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Literature on Jacobian norm:** The paper does not fully demarcate their contributions from that of Gamba et al 2023. Also, the discussion of Jacobian norms in (Khromov & Singh, 2023; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10886.pdf), their relation to generalization, and the bound on the variance via the Lipschitz, bear similarities to the some of the material presented here."
