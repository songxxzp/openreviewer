                "value": "This paper investigates the last-iterate convergence property of the algorithm family of Regret Matching, which is popular in practice but lacks corresponding theoretical guarantees for its good empirical performance. This paper fills the gap in this part. Specifically, the authors first show that RM+ and some of its variants, such as alternating RM+ and PRM+, may not converge by a toy example. Then, they prove that, under a very strong assumption of strict Nash equilibrium (NE), an assumption that usually does not hold in practice, RM+ enjoys last-iterate asymptotic convergence. Consequently, focusing on ExRM+, another algorithm in the RM+ family, the authors first prove that it enjoys last-iterate convergence when there is a unique limit point. Later, the authors rule out the case of infinite limit points and thus prove the last-iterate convergence of RM+. Besides, the authors prove an $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ best-iterate convergence rate for ExRM+. From the best-iterate analysis, they find a simple strategy for obtaining a linear last-iterate convergence rate is to restart the algorithm whenever the best-iterate comes. However, the distance to NE is not observable. To this end, they find a proxy variable (upper bound) for the distance to NE, restart the algorithm by checking the condition on the proxy variable, and eventually achieve a linear last-iterate convergence rate. Moreover, they also prove a similar linear rate for another RM+ variant called SPRM+, following the same flow as before. Finally, empirical studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

Subsequently, the authors introduce and evaluate two recently proposed variants of the RM algorithm.\n\nSpecifically they consider the Extragradient RM+ (ExRM+) and establish that it displays asymptotic last-iterate convergence and $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ best-iterate convergence. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that a version of ExRM+ incorporating restarts achieves linear last-iterate convergence.\nIn section 5, the authors extend the above last-iterate results to Smooth Predicative RM+ (that is another variant of RM+).

Additionally, they extend their linear-convergence findings to the variant of SPRM+ that employs restarts."

This finding adds an interesting dimension to the discussion.

In this context, investigating the last-iterate convergence properties of RM or RM+ appears to be a reasonable step in the right direction. However, I do have reservations about the significance of establishing last-iterate convergence results for artificial RM variants, especially given the existing results for Extragradient and OMD.\n\nAdditionally, I suggest that the paper could enhance its value by presenting time-average results for the different RM variants. It would be particularly intriguing to see the time-average convergence rates of the alternating PMR+ algorithm, which, as demonstrated in the provided experiments, seems to significantly outperform other RM methods in terms of last-iterate convergence. Furthermore, an experimental comparison of the last-iterate properties of Extragradient and OMD would be a valuable addition.\n\nIn summary, I consider this paper to be on the cusp of meeting the threshold for acceptance. It does contain some interesting findings, but I remain somewhat uncertain about their overall importance.
