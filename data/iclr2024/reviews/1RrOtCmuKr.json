                "value": "The novel ALAM framework introduced in this paper leverages average quantization and a simple sensitivity calculation method to reduce memory usage in LLMs without affecting their training efficacy. This approach minimizes gradient variance by compressing activations to their group average values, allowing for effective compression to less than 1 bit. Additionally, ALAM employs a novel sensitivity calculation that uses the L2 norm of parameter gradients, greatly reducing memory overhead. In testing, ALAM achieves up to a 12.5\u00d7 compression rate for activation memory in LLMs without sacrificing accuracy."

Their method is based on three core changes relative to existing methods. First, they apply a neuron re-ordering to group weights with similar distributions. This allows for finer-grained application of codebooks to weights without increasing the storage overhead of the compressed representation. Second, they propose to jointly learn the codebook and codebook mappings, similar to gradient-based post-training quantization schemes. Lastly, they modify the gradient update for the codebook mappings to enable more effective optimization."
