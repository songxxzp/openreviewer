                "value": "This paper looks into the problem of enhancing the quality of compression methods that use parameter sharing. It argues that existing parameter sharing methods, such as ROAST, can have instability issues during initialization and suggests a solution to reduce the instability called STABLE-RPS. The main idea of STABLE-RPS is to reshape the blocks into a single array, split it into several chunks, and apply a hashing function to determine which chunks to share parameters. The paper claims that this approach can improve the stability and pareto-continuity. Experiments on ResNet20/VGG on CIFAR10/100/TinyImagenet demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several existing pruning methods."

For example, the problem statement is vague --- \u201cIs pruning the correct method to reduce model parameters?\u201d. However, the authors do not define what are the \u201ccorrect methods\u201d for model compression. Are methods that exhibit better stability and Pareto-continuity considered as correct? Are there other correctness conditions?  The paper also uses unconvincing examples to support its arguments. For instance, the authors try to explain pruning adversely affects model capacity, and use an example \"Consider pruning a n \u00d7 d embedding table. If we prune beyond d\u00d7, we start getting degenerate zero embeddings.\" But what does \"pruning beyond dx\" even mean, and why is not it obvious that pruning reduces model capacity? \n\n2. The paper is narrowly focused on comparing with pruning-based methods, which are only a subset of the model compression techniques. The paper does not justify why pruning methods are the most relevant baselines for the proposed method, which belongs to the parameter sharing paradigm. The paper also ignores other important compression methods, such as quantization, distillation, and low rank factorization.\n\n3. The evaluation setups are weak. Evaluation is done on tiny datasets such as CIFAR10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet and very old architectures such as ResNet-20 and VGG-11 (10-year old), which raise questions on how well the observation from this work can be generalized to larger datasets, such as ImageNet, and more recent architectures, such as vision transformers."

How does the proposed method affect latency? It seems that flattening and chunking blocks would disrupt the original matrix multiplication operations, which could slow down the model execution significantly. The paper should provide latency results for the proposed method and other methods.\n\n3. Why does Theorem 3.2 involve cache line fetches? Cache line fetches are related to execution speed, not memory efficiency. The paper should explain how cache line fetches affect the memory consumption of the proposed method."
