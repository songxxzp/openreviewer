            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- Although the domain of the application (i.e., time-series modeling) is new and the proposed design brings an idea of the latent state evolution (in forecasting), the novelty seems to be limited. The overall architectural design follows the FFN architecture (Tancik, et al, 2020) without any consideration on how to handle multivariate time-series. Also, the idea of the latent modulation and the meta-learning-based training algorithm largely follow the previous approach (Dupont, et al, 2022). Finally, a similar idea of employing temporally-refined latent variables has been explored in (Yin, et al, 2023). \n\n- Regarding auto-decoding process:\n  \n  - For imputation, it is natural to assume that there is a given set of measurements for a new time-series, and to set up the goal to fill-in unseen data via imputation.  For forecasting, however, the assumption of having a separate training period and a look-back window raises some concerns. Having a separate look-back window suggests that the method needs to wait until the new observations are collected to make forecasting. Some of the datasets that are considered in the paper have hourly sampling rate and this time gap might provide enough time to fine-tune other baseline models (with many model parameters, e.g., Transformers). If the ultimate goal is to achieve accurate prediction, with the given time period (an hour), fine-tuning those baselines with a new observation may provide better prediction results.  \n\n  - Similarly, another concern is fairness on the comparisons. Although it is just 3 gradient steps, auto-decoding is considered as solving an optimization problem to fine-tune the model for the new observations. What happens if the small portion of the other baselines (e.g., the last layer) is fine-tuned during the inference? For example, in forecasting, the model can be fine-tuned after making predictions on the current sliding window and then make predictions on the next sliding window with the updated models. \n \n  - Although the method seems to provide accurate predictions both in imputation and forecasting, the method seems to struggle in predicting peaks accurately. In many applications, predicting peaks accurately would have more importance than simply minimizing MSEs (e.g., to properly prepare the electricity supply or properly set up the cost during the peak time period). Based on the eye-ball examination (Figure 5 for example), the model does not seem to provide accurate predictions in peak values."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "- As mentioned in the weakness section, could the author provide more justifications for performing auto-decoding while other baselines are used only for inference? Also, could the authors mention more about the fairness of the comparisons? \n\n- Appendix section D, Tables 13 and 14 emphasize the performance degradation in Transformers models as the testing window is far apart from the training period. Would there be realistic cases where we have only the old history for training, measurements are stopped for a while, and collecting results regularly again afterwards?\n\n- In Appendix, the paper provides experimental results for varying dimensionalities on the latent vectors and the number of gradient steps in auto-decoding during the inference. However, these experiments are performed in a limited experiment setting. Could the authors provide more insight on the effect of these hyper-parameters? For example, Table 6 provides the results with a specific dataset (Electricity) with a horizon length 720 and a look-back window length 512 and essentially says there will be no improvement after 10 or 50 gradient steps. Would this observation be valid for other datasets, for other sizes of windows? Also, what happens if the dimensionality of the latent vector is changed? Are these results also obtained by the multiple number of runs? \n\n- Could the authors also provide justifications on not to include other time-continuous models for their baselines? Such as neural ODEs and their variants for irregular time-series modeling?"

It is usually close to BRITS and some other baselines. This might indicate used datasets are too simple.

Something like MIMIC dataset might be a better choice, especially since it already contains missing values.\n\nAccording to Table 16, the model is more costly compared to already costly transformer-based models.\n\nAccording to Table 17, PatchTST is often outperforming proposed method which means that it's better at adapting to new time series, contrary to what is stated in the main text.\n\nAs a side note, it would be interesting to have a probabilistic version of this model.\n\nThe biggest drawbacks of this paper are lack of novelty, not so stellar results and not applying this method to actual continuous-in-time data."
