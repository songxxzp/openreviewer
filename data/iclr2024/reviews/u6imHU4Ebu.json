The paper reports significant generalization improvements compared to baseline methods and reveals the weaknesses of alternative approaches when dealing with linguistic ambiguities and behavioral differences.\n\n**Update after rebuttal**\n\nAfter the rebuttal, and with taking the additional clarity provided by the authors during the rebuttal into account, I raise my score, since they have clarified several points on the details of their work, and its limitation. Nevertheless, I still believe that the scope of their work can be improved if they provide additional evidence for LLaRP's performance outside their own benchmark, where previous competitive work exists."

There are many examples in the literature that actually have demonstrated that, some of which have been cited (such as ELLM, PALM-E, etc) and many were not discussed (e.g, SayCan, CodeAsPolicy, PercieverActor, HELM, ProgPrompt, EmbodiedGPT,...), though there are many examples of such methods. I recommend correcting the inaccuracies in such statements.\n- **lack of details:** the main paper lacks many details such as what simulation were used, how the agent executes the skills, how the skills are defined, and what is the contribution of the defined PDDL. Although some details are provided in the supplementary material, clarifications are needed to be presented in the main paper.\n- **lack of comparison to existing benchmarks:** The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison to available benchmarks (some examples includes but not limited to Habitat rearrangement, CortexBench, AI2Thor, Behavior1k, Procthor, ALFRED). Hence, it is not clear how the new provided axes and extending instructions stand against existing work. It is quite common in the literature to dedicate a section and a table to compare various aspects of a newly proposed benchmark to existing ones from various aspects such as scale, generalization aspects, number of samples, kinds of provided data (such as language instructions) etc.\n- **limited comparison to existing work:** although this paper compares to relevant approaches that have proven to be effective such as zeroshot in-context text-only, as well as encoder+LSTM, there are many seminal works that are applicable to this environment and it would bring more value to comparisons if the paper actually leverages some pre-existing methods. Examples of such methods include CodeAsPolicy (Code Gen), PercieverActor (BC), and SemanticHELM (pretrained vision and LLM+LSTM). Atari is a well-established benchmark, which has many competitive baselines, which has not been provided for comparison. Providing additional evidence on other embodied AI benchmarks where previous established baselines exists provides better comparison datapoints to compare the proposed method to the existing work."

Please consider including a direct comparison of model capacity in Fig. 3, as well as exact numbers in the bar plots (it seems that there is sufficient space to do so given the white space surrounding the bar plots). Same for Figures 5, 7, and so on.\n- The paper presents successful results but does not thoroughly explore or discuss failure cases. It would be great to have more qualitative examples that enable readers to understand the limitations of employing pretrained LLMs on embodied tasks.\n- It would be valuable to gain insights into the performance of simpler baselines, such as embedding-based models like embCLIP, or baselines from the embodied rearrangement literature such as [5], in comparison to the proposed approach. Currently, all existing baselines rely on pretrained Language Models (LLMs), with varying prompts and inputs. While this dependence on LLMs is shown to yield strong results, it would be good to understand the necessity and efficiency of LLMs for the tasks at hand. In other words, it is difficult to ground the work in existing embodied literature, since it introduces a new task (language rearrangement) and a new model (LLM-based LLaRP model trained with online RL). \n\n[1] Li, Shuang, Xavier Puig, Chris Paxton, Yilun Du, Clinton Wang, Linxi Fan, Tao Chen et. al. \"Pre-trained language models for interactive decision-making.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 31199-31212.\n\n[2] Carta, Thomas, Cl\u00e9ment Romac, Thomas Wolf, Sylvain Lamprier, Olivier Sigaud, and Pierre-Yves Oudeyer. \"Grounding large language models in interactive environments with online reinforcement learning.\" ICML (2023).\n\n[3] Xiang, Jiannan, Tianhua Tao, Yi Gu, Tianmin Shu, Zirui Wang, Zichao Yang, and Zhiting Hu. \"Language Models Meet World Models: Embodied Experiences Enhance Language Models.\" NeurIPS (2023).\n\n[4] Huang, Wenlong, Pieter Abbeel, Deepak Pathak, and Igor Mordatch. \"Language models as zero-shot planners: Extracting actionable knowledge for embodied agents.\" In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 9118-9147.
