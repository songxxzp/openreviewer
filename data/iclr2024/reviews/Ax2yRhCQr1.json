The authors first discuss the augmentation operator and show that it induces a pair of dual operators with corresponding eigenfunction decompositions. They then introduce the concepts of *augmentation complexity* (based on the infinity norm of a kernel defined by the augmentations) and the *ratio trace* (which roughly characterizes \"how much\" of the eigenspaces of the corresponding RKHS are captured by a given encoder).\n\nThe authors then prove a number of results based on these quantities. First, they show that the error of a downstream predictor can be decomposed into an approximation-error term (how closely the function can be recovered from the learned encoder's representation) and a downstream-estimation-error term (how well the linear readout actually recovers this function). Second, they consider approximating the top-d eigenspace of the RKHS using only a finite pretraining dataset, and show that this can be used to bound the approximation error term.\n\nFinally, the authors consider how their \"augmentation complexity\" measurement translates to real augmentations, focusing on masking transformations. They give theoretical values for it for the hypercube examples discussed in Cabannes et al. (2023), and also show how to estimate it for masked language modeling on the `wikipedia-simple` dataset."

I understand that this was an intentional choice, and I do think that this makes the analysis of augmentations more \"pure\".

This seems to be primarily an analysis of the augmentation distribution, with the model's role being just to achieve a good ratio trace with respect to those annotations. I'm not sure how easy it would be to extend this analysis to models with more structured inductive biases.~~\n- ~~(b) In the appendix, the authors state that their analysis \"clearly refutes the claim in Saunshi et al.

Also, I think the theoretical contributions of studying augmentations alone are valuable even if they don't fully explain the success of large-scale self-supervised learning, so this isn't a major concern.*\n\n**[W2]** The analysis starts from a strong assumption that the target function $f^*$ lies in a particular RKHS and satisfies a particular soft invariance condition. However, it's difficult to tell what this assumption actually means, or whether it would be true in practice. In particular, the RKHS membership seems quite strict, and adding even an arbitrarily small perturbation to $f^*$ might cause the assumption to no longer hold. (There is a bit of discussion in the appendix, but it's not clear to me what effect this would actually have on the main results.)\n\n*Edit: The authors have noted that assuming functions lie in a particular RKHS is standard for learning theory work and necessary to get statistical guarantees.*\n\n~~**[W3]** I think part of Proposition 1 is incorrect, or at least incorrectly stated.

            "questions": {
                "value": "**On inductive biases.** In the appendix, you state \"the nonparametric analysis established in this work clearly refutes the claim in Saunshi et al. (2022) that learning guarantees independent of the model inductive bias are necessarily vacuous\". I don't think this is true. As I understand it, Saunshi et al. show that when augmentations are approximately disjoint, the eigenspectrum of $\\Gamma\\Gamma^*$ decays extremely slowly, with many of the eigenvalues of $\\Gamma\\Gamma^*$ being close to 1 (or, under their notation, many eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian $L_\\circ = I - A_\\circ$ being close to 0). This means that the approximation error of the top-d eigenspace is necessarily very large. I think this same analysis also applies to your results; Saunshi et al.'s approximately-disjoint augmentations would imply $\\lambda_{d+1} \\approx 1$ and so your $\\tau \\approx 1$, leading to a blowup in the first term of your equation 14.\n\nIf I'm correct, I think this deserves more discussion, and I don't think you can say that you've refuted the claims of Saunshi et al. I also think the paper could be improved by giving more context about the relationship of your results to those of Saunshi et al. For instance, is there any relationship between your augmentation complexity and Saunshi et al.'s approximately-disjoint augmentations? One might expect that approximately-disjoint augmentations would imply a high augmentation complexity; if so, that could be useful to discuss.\n\nAlso, what do you mean by \"disentangle the effects of the model and the augmentation\"? It's not clear to me how the presented results disentangle these effects, although I do think they give a clear explanation of the role of the augmentations in particular.\n\n\n**Interpreting the soft invariance criterion.** Can you give any intuition about what satisfying Assumption 1 actually means in practice? It seems unlikely to me that functions of practical interest could be *exactly* represented as expectations of some function $g$ on augmentations, and I also don't see any way to verify whether or not Assumption 1 holds.\n\n**Part (iv) of Proposition 1.** Proposition 1 part (iv) states that $g^*$ satisfies Assumption 1. This doesn't make sense to me; Assumption 1 is a statement about $f^*$, not $g^*$. Do you mean to say that $g^*$ satisfies Equation (1)?\n\nThe proof of part (iv) also seems potentially incorrect. In particular I'm not sure how $\\langle g^*, (I - \\Gamma \\Gamma^*) g^* \\rangle_{P_A} \\le \\epsilon ||g^*||^2_{P_A}$ implies $\\langle g_0, (I - \\Gamma \\Gamma^*) g_0 \\rangle_{P_A} + ||g_1||^2_{P_A}  \\le \\epsilon (||g_0||^2_{P_A} + ||g_1||^2_{P_A})$; shouldn't $||g_1||^2_{P_A}$ be $\\langle g_1, (I - \\Gamma \\Gamma^*) g_1 \\rangle_{P_A}$ instead? It also seems like your proof here implies that $R(\\Gamma^*) \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_B(\\Gamma; \\epsilon)$ for all $\\epsilon$. But that doesn't seem like it could be true; perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\n**Asymptotic behavior of Theorem 2.** In Theorem 2, don't the quantities $\\overline{\\lambda}_d^{-1}$ and $\\gamma_G$ potentially depend on $N$? It seems like that could affect the asymptotic behavior of the bound in equation (20). Can you say anything about the convergence or boundedness of these quantities?\n\n**Relationship of this analysis to that of Johnson et al. (2023).** I noticed that parts of your analysis resemble some of the statements of Johnson et al. (2023) at a high level; in particular, your soft invariance assumption is similar to their \"approximate view invariance\" assumption, and the decomposition in Theorem 1 is somewhat similar to their bound in Proposition 4.2. The details are different (their analysis focuses on approximating functions $\\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ rather than $\\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and doesn't include the approximation error of the encoder) but it might still be worth including a brief discussion of the similarities.\n\n**Other suggestions / comments.**\n- Section 2 states \"Similar to RIP, this property clarifies the the role of augmentation: The augmentation defines a set of features (eigenfunctions) ordered by their a priori relevance to the target function.\" This wasn't clear to me; how does the isometry property relate the relevance of the eigenfunctions to the target function?\n- The definition of $||f||\\_n^2$ in section 3 doesn't seem to be used anywhere in the main paper.\n- It took me a while to locate the definition of $\\hat{f}$ when reading Theorem 1; perhaps you could add a reference back to equation (9) where it is defined.\n- Section 4 discusses the empirical eigenspace $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\_d$ before actually defining what it is, which was a bit disorienting; it might make sense to define it at the start of section 4 instead of at the end of page 6."

The paper is currently dense, not accessible to a general audience (as someone who is not well-versed in the area, I find the paper really challenging to read), and thus requires a major revision. Because of this, I have to admit that I have not fully understood the contribution of the paper. Specific comments are summarised below. \n \n### Significance \nThere are some elements that make the evaluation of significance difficult: \n* It is not clear how reasonable the assumption on the target function is. It seems that the assumption is conveniently introduced so that we can analyse the problem using a particular RKHS. Is there any motivating example for using $\\mathbb{E}_A[g^*(A)|x]$ as a target? It should be more straightforward to work with (functions on ) the augmentation space $\\mathcal{A}$ rather than $\\mathcal{X}$, as in Johnson et al., 2023.  \n* The encoder has to be of the form (10), as otherwise $\\hat{\\Psi}$ are not included in the RKHS. Therefore, the claim that the encoder $\\hat{\\Psi}$ can be arbitrary is not accurate to me. \n* The soft-invariance assumption is not straightforward to interpret. How does it measure \"invariance\"? Since $\\mathbb{E}[g(A)|x]$ and $g(a)$ are functions on different sets, the invariance is not well-defined.\n* The dimensionality dependency on the upper bound seems to be very pessimistic, as the authors admitted. I \n\nComments: \n* The problem is not well presented. It would have been more helpful if the authors had provided a high-level problem description and define symbols accordingly (e.g., as in the introduction of Johnson et al., 2023). For example, how representation learning is performed is not really mentioned using symbols in the paper (e.g., $\\hat{\\Phi}$ is not mentioned up to page 4). \n* Some symbols are loosely defined or mentioned before formally defined; e.g., $\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}_d$ is mentioned before the formal definition of \\hat{H}_{\\Gamma}. \n* Presentation of technical results could be improved. For instance, Proof Sketch of Theorem 1 only decomposes Theorem 1 into two parts, repeating what is mentioned in the remark, and thus could be omitted. \n* For Proposition 1, the authors might want to check Chapter 11 of \"An Introduction to the Theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces\" by Paulsen and Raghupathi.  \n* Using the same symbol for different density functions is confusing ($p(a)$ and $p(x)$). \n* Section 5. The term \"strong\" augmentation is obscure. One may consider an augmentation distribution that is independent of $x$, in which case the augmentation complexity is 1. Is the dependency between $A$ and $X$ considered a measure of \"strong\"?"

The analysis seems rigorous and, personally, I find the appearance of the spectral properties of the augmentation intriguing."

            "questions": {
                "value": "General remarks\n\n-The assumptions and notations should be pointed out more clearly. For instance\n\n       -it seems it is assumed, but I did not see it stated explicitly, that $P_\\mathcal{A}$ has a density, and that $p(a|x)$ and $p(x|a)$ exist.\n\n       -What is A in E(g(A)|x). Similarly, X is not defined as a random variable (it is clear from the context but should be defined).\n      \n       -The notational difference between $p$ and $p(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is small.\n\n-Is $\\hat{\\psi}$ always assumed to be of the form (10) or is (10) just an example?\n\n-Can you explain the choice of the distribution $P_{AX}$ a bit more? Particularly, it could be emphasized how the conditional distribution $P(\\cdot |x)$ has to be given. You can refer to the given examples.\n\n-Can your approach be used to build or suggest an augmentation-based pretraining? Maybe under assumptions on prior information on the distribution $P_X$?\n\n-Proposition 1, (iv): What does it mean that g* satisfies Assumption 1? Assumption 1 is an Assumption on $f^* \\in \\mathcal{L}^2(P_X)$, or does the statement in (iv) refer to (1)? The proof of statement (v) is done in the proof of statement (iv); I think those parts can be moved to the proof of statement (v).\n\n-In (1), how are A and A' drawn from $p(\\cdot |x)$? A motivation for (1) would be helpful. The space $\\mathcal{F}_B(\\Gamma;\\epsilon)$ is a central object, it would be good to motivate it more.\n\n-Can Assumption 1 be verified; is it a restrictive assumption?\n\n-Can $\\epsilon$ or violation of Assumption 1 be inferred during the learning process?\n\n-Definition 3: Is $G^{-1}$ well-defined, even if $d = \\infty$?\n\n-Remark after Lemma 2: What is $\\|\\cdot\\|_n$?\n\n-How is $d$ chosen? Equation (20) would motivate to choose $d$ such that there is a large gap between $\\lambda_d$ and $\\lambda_{d+1}$, but your result improves such a guess for $d$ compared to HaoChen21 and Saunshi22.\n\n-Is $\\bar{\\phi}$ an eigenfunction of $\\Gamma^*\\bar{\\Gamma}$? If so, how restrictive is the condition $\\hat{\\phi} = \\bar{\\phi}$; is this just the choice of the encoder?\n\n-It is good to see a separation of model and augmentation in the error analysis. Do you think a combination, for instance, through augmentation based on the model, can be fruitful, too?\n\n-Does Lemma 9 need a condition on boundedness of the matrix $QDQ^T$ or absolute convergence of the sum $\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^\\infty \\lambda_i q_i^T q_i$?\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n-Did you compute the ``sweet spot\" mentioned in the introduction? Can it be computed?\n\n-In Section 2.1 some reference for conditional expectation and RKHS could be added.\n\n-Proof of Proposition 1: The proof should also contain showing that $\\mathcal{H}_\\Gamma$ is complete.\n\n-Are $K_X$ and $K_A$ square integrable? It seems so from (4) and necessary from the proof of the statement that $\\Gamma^*\\Gamma$ and $\\Gamma\\Gamma^*$ are integral operators. Are conditions on P_AX$ needed that (4) holds?\n\n-Below Definition 2: I don't think that convexity of $D_{\\chi^2}$ is needed because the bound $S_\\lambda\\leq \\kappa^2$ follows from (11), via $\\kappa^2 \\geq K_X(x,x) = S_\\lambda$.\n\n-First sentence of Section 3: Assumption 1 could be mentioned to recall the bound for $\\|f^*\\|$ in $H_{\\Gamma}$.\n\n-Lemma 5: Below Lemma 5, it is mentioned that the required 4th order bound holds. Why is the condition for such a bound included in the statement of the lemma?\n\n-Around Definition 2 you can refer to Examples 1,2,3 for examples of the augmentation complexity.\n\n-Are there exponential lower bounds on $\\kappa$ in Examples 2,3?\n\nTypo: Page 4: \"the the\", the word ``the\" was used two times"
