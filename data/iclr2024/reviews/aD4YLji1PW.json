                "value": "- The approach is very unclear from the general modeling to how the experiments were performed. It's very hard to judge if the modeling is realistic and the experiments were carried out in a fair way. I will break down the main sources of confusion below:\n\n -- It is not clear to me what is the \"population\" of agents that the ego agent has to beat on equation (2). In a practical application, is the agent expected to have to beat an unknown population of agents? If the population is unknown (which sounds to me a more realistic modeling), how is the agent able to generate the strategies it plays against when the curriculum is created? If the population of opponents is known beforehand (which sounds very unrealistic for most applications), it explains how the agent can generate the curriculum.\n\n -- I don't quite understand what is a \"solution\" for the GA so that crossover and mutation is applied. The agent can realistically pick which opponent it is going to play against for a particular episode, what else composes the \"curriculum task:? how are those combined/mutated. Those are key elements of the proposed algorithm and are not clearly explained in the main text of the paper. In special, I cannot understand what the agent has the power to manipulate to generate a new \"curriculum task\".\n\n -- The \"blind agent\" sounds to be a very ad hoc addition to the algorithm. How should this blind agent be developed for a new domain? Is there an automated way of generating it? I assume just generating an agent with random actions would have no effect given that for any reasonably-complex task a random agent would be very easily beaten.\n\n -- It's not clear what are the 5 \"baseline opponents\" used to test the algorithms in the experimental evaluation. Are the agents aware of those opponents and able to use them for training for as long as they have remaining training steps? or are they held out just for generating metrics. An interesting way of validating the algorithms would be to have a number of high-performance strategies they can manipulate to play against during training, and a number of unknown strategies that are never seen by the agents and only used for calculating the performance metrics. In this way you would actually be evaluating how general is the learned strategy.\n\n -- How strong are the strategies that the agents had to beat in the experiments, and how were them learned? In the evaluation, there should be at least one adaptive agent that is given time to learn how to \"hack\" the ego agent strategy.\n\n- THe literature review was very limited on the transfer of information and curriclum in multi-agent systems. I was surprised that the authors did not mention the first survey to suggest to develop multi-agent curricula of evolving strategies: \n\nSilva, Felipe Leno Da, and Anna Helena Reali Costa. \"A survey on transfer learning for multiagent reinforcement learning systems.\" Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 64 (2019): 645-703.\n\nAlso, while the agents knowing and controlling the opponent strategies sounds unrealistic, they could easily model then and build Curricula based on modeled versions of those opponents: \n\nStefano V. Albrecht, Peter Stone, Autonomous agents modelling other agents: A comprehensive survey and open problems, Artificial Intelligence, Volume 258, 2018.\n\nOne issue that some Curriculum Learning approaches observed is that it is hard to figure out how many tasks have to be generated. One popular approach executes a random walk based on the task transferability to prune huge Curricula:\n\nSilva, F. L. D., & Costa, A. H. R. (2018, July). Object-oriented curriculum generation for reinforcement learning. In Proceedings of the 17th international conference on autonomous agents and multiagent systems (pp. 1026-1034)."

Related to #1, the ablation study in Section 5.3 shows that the use of the blind agent is an important factor in GEMS. However, the initial behavior of the blind agent is manually set by a human (e.g., the blind agent is set to circle around the ego agent (Section 5.2)). As such, GEMS would require a human to manually tune the initial blind agent. \n3. The paper states that \"Over time, those opponents will evolve toward the Nash equilibrium\". However, there are no theoretical analyses, and it is unclear from empirical evaluations that GEMS converges to Nash equilibrium. \n4. It is unclear how to scale GEMS to more complex multi-agent domains that involve images as agent inputs. Also, the problem statement (Equation 1) in Section 3.1 is only with respect to the ego agent, so it is unclear when there is more than one ego agent in settings."

What about just a random policy? \n- The curriculum learning aspects of the environments evaluated in the paper are very limited. For example, in Volley the initial velocity of the ball does provide an obvious form of curriculum (start slow and speed up as agent gets better), however this is incredibly simple and does not provide really provide much signal for the agent. I think it would be much more interesting if this framework was tested in environments where there exists a lot of potential complexity in the underlying environment, that can also be stripped down to a simple version for the curriculum (e.g. single-agent MiniGrid has much more scope for going from basic to complex unlike these environments, in my opinion)"
