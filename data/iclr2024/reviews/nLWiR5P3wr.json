The authors attempt to circumvent problems that have affected previous attempts to use particle based variational inference for ensembles, with a lack of effective repulsion in weight space (intended to promote functional diversity) chief among them.  This paper proposes instead to enforce diversity in the input gradients rather than in weight space, by using Wasserstein gradient descent along with an RBF kernel defined over the input gradients to guide the particles during training.  They compare against deep ensembles and other BNNs on accuracy, calibration, and robustness to covariate shift."

At a 3x computational premium to DEs, the penalty paid in compute seems to be the largest drawback of FoRDE with respect to DEs.  Do the authors have any ideas for reducing this burden?

Could this be circumvented by employing a simpler base kernel? \n- Again in section 3.3, is the median heuristic required?

However, due to the over-parameterization of neural networks, weight-space repulsion suffers from redundancy.\" (2) \"Weight-space repulsion is ineffective due to difficulties in comparing extremely high-dimensional weight vectors and the existence of weight symmetries (Fort et al., 2019; Entezari et al., 2022).\" Could you provide a more detailed explanation of this?\n\n2. The paper outlines the advantages of ensemble methods in four specific areas: (1) predictive performance, (2) uncertainty estimation, (3) robustness to adversarial attacks, and (4) corruptions. In the experimental results, it delves into (1) using ACC, (2) using NLL and ECE, and (4) using cA, cNLL, and cECE. Did you carry out any experiments regarding (3) by any chance? Considering that the current experimental results are somewhat lacking in (1) and (2), it might be worthwhile to focus more on (3) and (4).\n\n3. FoRDE-PCA exhibits robust performance in addressing common corruptions (although it shows a minor decrease in its in-distribution performance). Hence, I would like to suggest providing more detailed experimental results concerning common corruptions, e.g., if it operates similarly to EmpCov (Izmailov et al., 2021), it is worth exploring whether the most beneficial corruption type aligns as well.\n\n---\nFort et al., 2019, Deep ensembles: A loss landscape perspective.  \nEntezari et al., 2022, The role of permutation invariance in linear mode connectivity of neural networks.  \nIzmailov et al., 2021,  Dangers of Bayesian model averaging under covariate shift."
