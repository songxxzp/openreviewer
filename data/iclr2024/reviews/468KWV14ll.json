This refinement encourages agents to engage in more extensive exploration. The proposed method excels in challenging online exploration scenarios and effectively serves as an anti-exploration mechanism in D4RL offline tasks."

For example, in case of ReBRAC MuJoCo scores are reported correctly for each dataset but average is changed to the lower value from 81.2 to 78.0. ReBRAC's scores on AntMaze match original paper except antmaze-large-diverse where they are swapped between ReBRAC and SAC-RND which leads to ReBRAC's average performance 75.4 instead of 76.8 which is better than DRND. \n\nSAC-RND performs poorly on Adroit D4RL domain and DRND is not tested on it. DRND performs better only on MuJoCo tasks. I could admit experimental results to be strong if DRND's performance on Adroit is competitive to ReBRAC or IQL.\n\n**Online RL results**\n\nI haven't seen references to online RL baselines results. Problems with offline RL results make me question reported plots reliability. Please, correct me if I've missed it.\n\n**Hyperparameters choice**\n\nHyperparameter choice procedure is also not clear from the text, please indicate if I've missed it. Hyperparameters candidates for $\\lambda$ parameters are not presented and values are different for every offline dataset. Both, SAC-RND and ReBRAC, also tune this parameters for every dataset but they also report sensitivity to hyperparameters. \nReBRAC's authors tuned parameters on a few seeds and then evaluated all of the algorithms on another set of hyperparameters which lead to the SAC-RND performance drop comparing to the original work (SAC-RND reported results without evaluating on different set of seeds). Could you please say if the same procedure followed your work?"

It can be easily done with EOP (https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04156) if there are logs from hyperparameters search. ReBRAC provide EOP scores for ReBRAC and IQL which can be reused for comparison. \n\n* How DRND would perform in offline-to-online setting, e.g. on AntMaze? It is an open question for SAC-RND. Since DRND is reported to have good online performance it can be potentially used in offline-to-online setup. You can compare with the results from ReBRAC's latest revision."

The newly proposed intrinsic reward combines two bonuses, one which generalizes RND and the other one generalizes Coin Flip Networks (CFN).\n\nTheoretical analysis in the linear setting supports the idea, and experiments in online and offline settings show that the proposed implementation can provide benefits over RND and other bonus-based approaches."

Using state-actions for DRND and only states for RND is not an exact comparison; there should be analysis/ablations where DRND uses just states, and RND uses state-actions.\n\nThis might be particularly important as the performance difference between RND and DRND is small in many environments.\n\n**W2.**  The proposed approach computes intrinsic rewards by combining two bonuses. However, I feel that introducing the second bonus\u2013similar to the bonus from Coin Flip Network (CFN)--is not sufficiently well-motivated. Could the authors explain the need for the second bonus? Why is $b_1$ alone insufficient? \n\n**W3.** The paper would benefit from comparisons with ensemble-based RND in the online setting, for example, along the lines of [1] or [2]. Even though ensemble-based approaches may be computationally more costly, having these results would be helpful data points.\n\n**W4.** The presentation of the paper can be improved. Some suggestions are listed below.\n\n- The intrinsic reward paragraph in the preliminaries is unclear. What is $y_t$ the target for? \n- The RND method is defined with observations, but the preliminaries define an MDP with states.\n- Some sentences are hard to understand, e.g., \u201cand its interpretability needs to be more apparent than count-based techniques\u201d and \u201cThese approaches are implemented through formulas such as $r_t =$ ..\u201d\n- What does the shading in figures represent?\n- It would also be helpful to show DRND\u2019s performance in Figure 1 rather than having Figures 1 and 3 separate.\n- The term \u201cdeep exploration\u201d should be explained in the paper or supported by citations.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the direction the authors took toward improving RND-like intrinsic bonuses. I remain open to increasing the score should the weaknesses and questions be adequately addressed/clarified.\n\n\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\n\n### References\n\n[1] Ciosek, K., Fortuin, V., Tomioka, R., Hofmann, K., & Turner, R.
