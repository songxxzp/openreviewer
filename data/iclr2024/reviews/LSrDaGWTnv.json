No matter how beautiful the derivation is, a method that does not work in the real world has no value. I have severe doubts that it will every work, say, for modeling an industrial process or a robot turning a knob to open a door. For my taste, the assumptions in section 3 are far too strong to be left unchecked on real data.\n\nThe paper has multiple presentation and language issues:\n1. Use of terms: The term \"planning\" has a technical meaning in artificial intelligence. That meaning is very different from temporal inter- or extrapolation, which is what it is refers to in the paper. Therefore, even the paper title is completely misleading. A similar consideration applies to the central term \"representation\", which is used as a map from observations to a latent space, and also for an element of that space, sometimes with different meaning within the same sentence.\n2. Abbreviations: The abbreviations \"CV\" and \"NLP\" are of course generally understood in the community. It is nevertheless good style to state the complete terms at least once before using abbreviations. Other abbreviations are less commonly known, like NCE.\n3. Figure 1 is pretty meaningless.\n4. The first paragraph of section 2 ends in the middle of a sentence.\n5. I am surprised to see that the title of section 4 coincides with the paper title.\n6. At the point figure 2 is presented (section 1), the symbols in the figure are not introduced yet.\n7. Why on earth should one gray out a proof?"

It is often more critical to show how effective the sampled states can be used in planning, which is not studied in this paper. \n\nThe main theoretical results lemma 4.1, 4.2 alone seem not enough for a top conference. The authors should discuss the connection to several related work: PILCO work by Marc et al., and Gaussian processes for data-efficient learning in robotics and control. Although the proposed methods are not the same, the involved computation bears similarities and all works involves planning. The authors might agree that the two works contain more contributions both theoretically and empirically."

I acknowledge the author's emphasis on the theoretical aspect of their work and  I highly value theoretical contributions. From what I gather, the author asserts that their work simplifies the planning process by deriving the analytical Gaussian form. I agree with this statement. However, at present, it remains challenging to envision how this method can offer practical utility in moderately complex environments and tasks. It raises questions about its direct applicability and the potential necessity of heuristics. The inclusion of empirical evidence would significantly strengthen the case for acceptance. Currently, I find myself in a somewhat undecided position.\n\n* The relationship between Section 4 (inference over representations) and its applicability to specific tasks remains somewhat unclear. In RL, particularly in control tasks, our primary objective is to acquire the optimal policy, and any guarantees should pertain to the performance of this learned policy. It appears that this paper intends to convey the idea that learned representations can be useful for \"inference over representations.\" However, it raises questions about whether \"inference over representations\" serves as the ultimate goal when analyzing data or if there are additional, more concrete objectives we should aim to address. Is there an opportunity to provide a more theoretically rigorous framework that aligns with the typical goals we seek to achieve?"

Is the current use of the term \"planning\" widely accepted within the community? In my perspective, the term \"inference\" appears to be a more precise descriptor.\n\n* Is the primary assertion in Section 3, which states \"learned representations follow isotropic Gaussian distributions,\" a novel contribution? The current phrasing does not distinctly convey what aspects are original. For instance, the reference to \"supported by analysis based on Wang and Isola\" is somewhat ambiguous. Does this imply that such analysis has been previously conducted in their work?"
