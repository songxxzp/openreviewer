                "value": "This work investigates the problem of rapid adaptation to an unknown opponent policy. The proposed approach is to learn a latent opponent model and play the response to the currently predicted opponent. They developed this under the namesake TAO (Transformers Against Opponent), a sequential application of three existing methods (learning policy embeddings, computing responses to known opponents, and few-shot adaptation). TAO is evaluated in the Markov Soccer and Multiagent Particle games and tends to perform at least as well as an existing method."

In each experiment, the authors skip straight to making a concluding remark after describing their experimental method. A discussion of the results, beyond \"see Fig X\" is required and why the provided evidence leads to the resulting conclusion. In general, I also found the claims to be too strong for the provided figures. \n- This work redefines the notion of \"offline opponent modeling\" and expands its problem description to also include adaptation. I think this redefinition confuses more than aids in clarifying the problem space. I would strongly recommend against this redefinition. I think this also causes this paper to feel like it's trying to do too much and then only do a cursory treatment of each problem (modeling and adaptation). I think the paper would have been stronger if the authors focused on these problems independently and then together.\n- It's not clear to me what is added to our understanding of this problem from using transformers and \"in-context learning\" --- a vogue rebranding of concepts like correlation devices. I was hoping the authors could comment on their vision of this research, beyond that transformers are a neural network architecture that previous methods cannot readily apply.\n\n\n**Minor (Not Effecting Score)**\n- The language in the paper at times feels very unnatural (uncanny ChatGPT-esque), and I personally found it hard to read.\n- In the figures \"# Opponent Policy\" --> \"# Opponent Policies\"."

                "value": "- Sec 3.1, \"Specifically Tk1 ... usually with certain noise.\" The notation is a touch confusing here wrt your datasets. Does this mean that you only consider datasets where each player plays the same policy? If so, why?\n- Sec 4.2, how do you control for the ego agent's influence on the trajectory? \n  - It's not clear to me what these \"fragments\" are, why you're taking them, and why it's sensible to stitch together what appears to be sub-trajectories from differing episodes. \n  - I would have liked to see baselines/ablations related to their opponent-modeling proposal.\n- Sec 4.4, why are the differences in optimality guarantees not directly stated in the paper?\n  - What is it about TAO that enables the improvement in results? \n  - It's not clear to me that TAO should beget any improvements, so is it proof of a stronger bound?\n- Sec 5.1, \"We adopt three kinds of test settings for \u03a0 test, where seen is equivalent to the offline opponent policy set \u03a0 off, unseen contains some previously unseen opponent policies, and mix is a mixture of the former two.\" It appears _unseen_ and _mix_ are redundant and contain only different partitions of held-in and held-out policies. \n  - Why not also test generalizations to strictly held-out policies? \n  - How were the ordering of policies selected for the adaptation experiments? \n- Figure 4 has a non-standard y scale. Why are all the BR performances so bad against the subset of opponents that necessitated expanding the low-performance bracket? This smells like there is an issue in the quality/diversity of the opponent population because there are only extremely high and low-scoring performances.\n- Sec 5.2, Question 1\n  - \"TAO consistently outperforms other baselines ... this implies that TAO can respond effectively to unseen ...\" No evidence supporting this claim, and it is exceptionally strong. At best, the authors can claim that it performs better than baseline methods. \n  - Suggest also computing best responses directly to each opponent independently. This allows some measurement of what BR performance actually is, so we can have a better estimate of how much of true BR performance is recovered and how quickly. \n  - In Figure~4, while it is true that TAO looks like it's performing well, I don't think there's any clear narrative here. It's losing to other methods sometimes, often draws with many other methods, and the variance is exceptionally large. Indicates the need for additional study as to when each method is effective. \n  - How are you measuring \"strong adaptability ... swiftly adjusting\"?\n  - Fig 3 (b) is not explained ever and I'm not sure what it's trying to say. \n- Sec 5.2, Question 2\n  - It's not clear to me how a tSNE embedding is sufficient to show \"ability to recognize\". I would expect a clear quantitive result here.\n  - One such way to do this would be to look at the similarity of the embeddings of known opponent trajectories compared to circumstances where the agent has varying degrees of information inaccuracy. For example, it's previous episodic context could be from a different opponent. Another option is to measure the clustering of the embeddings. Or one could consider training a classifier on the frozen embeddings to see how well it could classify their originating opponent policy.\n  - Moreover, the authors need to supply similarity comparisons of their opponent policies.\n    - From investigating their description in the appendix I'm actually surprised they're not overlaping in tSNE space. Some are very similar! \n    - An explanation for this could be that the game is just very easy and each opponent policy defines nearly unique state spaces (after the initial few steps). Any performance differences could be attributed to that method/BR being poorly trained in that specific game state.\n- Sec 5.2, Question 3\n  - \"This suggests that PEL .... robust in-context learning abilities\" No evidence offered to support that PEL offers exactly \"more robust in-context learning abilities\".\n  - Should mention whether these results match previous work and discuss their (ag/disag)reement. This experiment appears to me to be largely a reproducibility experiment of a known method for policy representation learning.\n- I would have preferred if the authors had ablated the various three components of TAO. Did the authors investigate these?\n- For Figure 3 and 6 could you account for the performance difference between the subplots and why it appears that in 3(b), 4, and 6(b) the error is often much higher than seen in any bar charts of tables.\n- Perhaps the most interesting result, to me, is that of Question 7 in the appendix. Where you see evidence that larger context lengths can further confuse TAO as their is further uncertainty as to what evidence should be considered. I was wondering if the authors could speak more on this and how they think this could be addressed?"

In section 4.2, the function GetOffD begins by sampling $C$ trajectories from $\\tau^{-1,k}$, following which it samples $H$ consecutive\nfragments from each trajectory and ultimately stitches them together. The reason for this design should be explained more clearly. Specifically, during deployment (section 4.3), the method collects the latest $C$ trajectories which are reasonable. However, during the training, the sampled $C$ trajectories are often from different periods which may not be very related to $y_t$ and $a_t$. Why this would help with the training?\n\n2. In experiments, the authors mention \"previously unseen opponent policies\". How to define \"unseen\"? Is it possible that an unseen policy is similar to a certain seen policy?\n\n3.

                "value": "My main concern is on the lack of clarity and theoretical rigor in this paper.\nAdditionally, while there was motivation for the problem setup and high-level design choices, most of the proposed method lacked description or reasoning.\n\nFor example, a common occurrence in the paper is the mathematical description of a loss used with barely any description of what it achieves (I *believe* equation 5 is typical behavioral cloning; supervised learning on the action in the data set, but I had to infer this), often including cryptic terms as \"GetOnD\" which \"samples fragments from each trajectory of W and then stitches them together\".\nIt was sometimes unclear what even the intended task was of a particular component in the model and necessary to reverse engineer it from the proposed solution.\n\nLack of rigor is especially visible in the theoretical analysis where the first theorem reads as \"assume that (...) M is (...), then <statement>\" but (I assume) the notation is such that <statement> does not even mention \"M\", making it unclear why that assumptions affects the statement at all to begin with.\nThe second theorem states their method has \"better optimally guarantees\" but does not mention what \"better\" means in this context.\n\nAs a result this paper reads as a recipe for training a particular model to solve their a problem setting of which the generality is difficult to judge.\nThis is to the detriment of the paper because, despite theirr focus on opponent modeling, I would not be surprised if (with some notation/generality) adjustments this could just as easily be applied to any (non-opponent) meta-learning tasks."
