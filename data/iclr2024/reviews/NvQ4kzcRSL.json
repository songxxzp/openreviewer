Additionally, the quality of some of the figures, such as Figure 1, could be enhanced.\n\n-**Method is not clearly presented**:  The introduction of the proposed method in this article is quite unclear. For instance, in Section 3.2.2, the authors abruptly introduce a new concept, CFSFDP, making it challenging for readers unfamiliar with this concept to grasp the purpose of this section. It seems that the authors did not effectively emphasize the main focus of this paper. In my view, since Masked Graph Autoencoders are already established content, the author's primary contribution should lie in the clustering part. However, the authors dedicate a significant amount of content to the introduction of Graph masking and AutoEncoder, which, in my opinion, is unnecessary. While the authors provide Algorithm 1 as a summary of the entire model, this algorithm appears overly concise. Furthermore, in Equation (3), the authors propose using mutual information to calculate the loss. However, I fail to discern the connection between Equation (3) and Equation (4) with mutual information.\n\n-**Rationality for the designs**: Some of the designs proposed in this paper appear to rely heavily on intuition, and certain claims lack robust supporting evidence. For example, in Section 3.1.1, it is not clear why masking both modal information at the same time is considered harmful. In Section 3.1.2, the reasoning behind why a graph autoencoder would overemphasize proximity information needs further explanation. In 3.2.1, the motivation behind adding a mask to Z_m is not well-justified.  I hope the authors can provide their own analysis rather than simply following others' claims."

                "value": "1.  The technique novelty is limited.  As they claimed in the introduction, the main contribution of this paper is the usage of graph masking autoencoder for clustering analysis. However, this technique has been well studied in self-supervised learning on graphs/ pretrain models on graphs.  It is not clear why the model can improve the generalization ability.  Another important technique,  density-based clustering algorithm, has also been well-studied in both graph and non-graph domains. \n\n2. Some important claims are not well verified. It claims that the model has better generalization ability. They conduct experiments on noisy/incomplete datasets to verify these claims.  This is confusing.  It is more like robustness instead of generalization.  It is not clear why the model has better interpretability.  \n\n3. Some experiments are confusing. For example,  \"but both NMI and ARI values are significantly decreased. This means that the interpretability and generalization performance of the results decreased.\"  How to infer interpretability and generalization from NMI and ARI  are not clear.  From table 3, GCMA is better than GCMA-A in COra. However, the visualization results in Figure 5 show that GCMA-A is better. There is no explanation or description of that. \n\n4. The presentation is messy, especially table 4 to table 8."
