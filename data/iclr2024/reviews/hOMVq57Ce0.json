                "value": "The paper presents a novel architecture for actor-critic algorithms with the goal of increasing the interpretability of the learned policies. The proposed architecture learns a model that maps each input to a linear function, which is used to predict the agent's action. The underlying assumption is that, if we can understand the set of linear functions used to produce actions, then the model is \"partially\" interpretable. \n\nThe new architecture, HyperCombinator (HC), is evaluated with SAC, where the actor model is replaced with an HC. The SAC-HC algorithm is evaluated on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark. The empirical results show that the performance of SAC-HC in terms of sample efficiency is similar to that of SAC. \n\nThe paper also presents plots showing how different linear functions are used across different episodes of problems such as Cheetah."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I have two main concerns with this paper. The first is about a whole body of work on programmatic policies that the paper overlooks. The second is about the weak evaluation related to the interpretability of the proposed model. I'll detail each concern below.\n\n**Missing Related Work**\n\nBelow are some related works that I think the paper missed. The paper should cite some of these to better place its contributions within the existing literature. Others should serve as baselines in the experiments, as I explain later.\n\nThere's a line of research called Programmatically Interpretable RL (PiRL), see Verma et al. The goal in this line of research is to create programs that encode policies for RL problems. One of the key motivations behind PiRL is interpretability. Both Verma et al. and Bastani et al. use imitation learning to train interpretable models. Later, Qiu and Zhu found a way to learn similar policies with a fully differentiable approach, so there's no need for imitation learning. The architecture of Qiu and Zhu is essentially an oblique decision tree, which could also be trained with ReLU neural networks, as discussed in the work of Lee and Jaakkola and of Orfanos and Lelis. \n\nThe properties of ReLU networks share a lot in common with what's mentioned in the paper for the HC architecture:\n\n1. \"We make the functions $a$ and $\\theta$ explicit through a new parametrization of the NN.\"\n\nThis is also possible with ReLU networks. In these networks, the function $a$ is the set of weights in the hidden layers, while $\\theta$ is the function the model learns when the activation pattern is fixed (see Lee and Jaakkola for more). So, what makes the HC different from ReLU networks?\n\n2. \"We explicitly control the number of unique sub-policies of $\\pi$ through the dimension $dG$ of the Gumbel-Softmax layer.\"\n\nThis is also the case with the number of neurons in ReLU networks. Another way to reduce the number of unique sub-policies in ReLU networks is to use a single hidden layer with strong L1 regularization (refer to Orfanos and Lelis).\n\n3. \"Policies modeled with the HyperCombinator differ from MLPs in that they usually aren't continuous at the border between linear regions.\"\n\nI'm not sure why this is crucial, but ReLU networks also switch the linear function that gives the prediction when you move from one region to another.\n\n4. \"Our approach is locally interpretable, explaining the sub-policy applied to any given example.\"\n\nThis is true for ReLU networks mapped to Oblique Decision Trees too. The function that gives the prediction is at the leaf node. The path in the tree might not be easy to understand, but the linear function at the leaves is just as clear as those in the HC architecture.\n\nGiven all these similarities, small ReLU networks should be used as baselines in the experiments. Specifically, the architecture by Qiu and Zhu showed strong results on the same benchmark problems used in this paper.\n\nOther papers I mention below might be less crucial but are related. So, it would be good to see where this paper stands within the broader literature. For example, Inala et al. discuss how to learn interpretable finite state machines for RL problems. Koul et al. learn FSM policies for RL problems from recurrent networks. Aleixo and Lelis look at programmatic policies in multi-agent RL. Trivedi et al. and Liu et al. learn a latent space of a domain-specific language which can be used to search for programmatic policies. All these papers explore potentially interpretable policies for RL problems, making them relevant to this submission.\n\n**Lack of Evaluation on Interpretability**\n\nThe paper mostly gives anecdotal evidence when it comes to the interpretability of the policies. I appreciate the plots showing how the sub-policies work, but they're just examples. For some reason, the literature on interpretable policies doesn't focus much on evaluating interpretability. The papers I've listed below are weak in this area too. But none of them emphasize interpretability as much as this one does. The big unanswered question is: are these policies really interpretable, and if so, to whom?\n\n**References**\n\n1. Osbert Bastani, Yewen Pu, and Armando Solar-Lezama.

The conventional linear policies, while interpretable, lack the expressivity to tackle complex tasks. In light of this, the authors advocate for piecewise-linear policies that aim to marry the interpretability of linear policies with enhanced performance akin to complex neural models.\n\n### Methodology\n\nTo this effect, they introduce the \"HyperCombinator\" (HC), a neural architecture that embodies a piecewise-linear policy with a controlled number of linear sub-policies. Every interaction with the environment engages a specific linear sub-policy, enhancing the interpretability while maintaining competitive performance. The architecture is a preset number of sub-policies, each in the form of a set of linear coefficients, gated by a MLP with one-hot output with Gumbel-softmax reparameterization allowing end-to-end training.\n\n### Main Contributions\n\nThe key contributions encapsulated in the paper are as follows:\n\n- They delineate the attributes that a desirable interpretable piecewise-linear policy should exhibit.\n- They design the HyperCombinator, a novel architecture that encapsulates a piecewise-linear policy with a defined number of linear sub-policies, and which is amenable to a broad spectrum of RL algorithms.\n- They analyze the interpretability of HyperCombinator.\n- They conduct evaluations of the model on control and navigation tasks, showcasing that the model retains a robust performance despite its curtailed expressivity.\n- They leverage the interpretability of HC to develop two visualizations that elucidate the policy's reactions to inputs and unveil the temporal abstractions in task execution through tracking the sequence of sub-policies employed."

The authors clearly describe the desiderata for the ideal interpretable RL methods, and are clear about how their proposed approach seeks to address these points.\n- The authors' commitment to maintaining linear policies at some level is good, as these will always be very interpretable on their own.\n- The authors provide nice visualizations of their approach and their empirical results."

Pasting together a set of linear policies does not seem that differentiated from prior work.\n- It's not clear practically how interpretable the resulting model is. I suppose the user is supposed to inspect the linear model coefficients to understand what the policy is doing. However, there is not much discussion of this. For example, how should I interpret the coefficient heatmap in Figure 3?\n- As it stands, it seems the approach is less of a compromise between interpretability and performance and more of a deterioration of performance while only gaining a little bit of interpretability."
