Mixup is a well-established augmentation technique with a lot of empirical success (e.g., generalization, adversarial robustness mentioned in this work), but it's hard for the reviewer to establish the connections between these empirical successes and the theoretical results shown in the paper. The authors talk about the difference in test performance of FashionMNIST might be attributed to its inability to achieve the theoretical geometric structure. Yet, such results are not definitive on their own. Therefore, the reviewer believes the paper needs additional work to discuss its practical implications.\n\nMinor:\nSections 1.2-1.5 could be placed before the figures on pages 2 and 3 for better clarity."

The connection between neural collapse in mixup and the generalization and calibration improvement of mixup is not further investigated\n\n3. In Figures 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7, although the literal descriptions in the captions are clear, but in the plots the gradient effects of the colors are not distinct. It hard to tell how the $\\lambda$'s vary from the plots.\n\n4. Also in these figures, both the same-class and the different-class activations with $\\lambda=0.5$ use the color black. Again, though the plots are clearly described in words, the colorations may still bring misunderstandings.\n\n5. How the activations are projected into 2D planes for visualization in the figures is not clearly explained. Particularly:\n a. Is it training data or test data that is used to generated these plots?\n b. In the caption of Figure 1, what does it mean by saying \"project activations onto the classifier\"? From my understanding of the initial observation of neural collapse, we just need to project the last layer activations and the components of the classifier onto a same low-dimension space. Is that correct? And if so is the projecting method in this paper different from that?\n c. How is the conclusion \"last layer activations align with the classifier\" justified from the figures? Or from other observations presented in this paper?\n\n6. The theoretical explanation has made an assumption that the classifier is a simplex ETF. This would be a very strong assumption if further proof or demonstration of it is not provided. \n\n7. Also, the theoretical explanation only considers the last layer features and the training targets, but not the inputs. In mixup, sometimes the mixed training target of a mixed input may not in fact be the ground-truth target of the input. Consider a datasets with three clusters of points side by side, suppose the clusters on the two sides are class 1 and the cluster in the middle is class 2. It is possible that a point mixed from two points in class 1 fall into the cluster of class 2, in other words, this point may be labelled both class 1 or class 2. These two scenarios will result in different training target, which will then result in different optimal last layer features. However, the point can have only one possible last layer feature output in a single model. Does this contradict the theoretical explanations in this paper? Should this point be aligned with the classifier component corresponding to class 1 or that corresponding to class 2?\n\n8. In section 4.4, I think the observations in this paper don't sufficiently corroborate the so mentioned linearity of representations, since this paper didn't investigate the representations in early or middle layers. If only based on the observations of this paper, one can also argue that the representations in all layers have linearity in mixup.\n\n9. Overall I think, although the reported observations are new, they are nevertheless superficious and brief. In my opinion it's not much of surprise that same-class  mixed activations perform similarly to conventional neural collapse in ERM and that different-class mixed activations align with the decision boundaries, since different-class mixup induces linear combinations on the training targets while same-class mixup normally somehow performs similarly to conventional data augmentations. The effort the authors have put into the investigations is appreciated, but the presented results don't seem adequate to constitute a rich-content formal paper."

Figure 6, second row. The characteristics exhibit an interesting behavior, that they are low at the very beginning of the training processes, then increase, and then decrease again, and their final level may even be higher than their initial level. Can the authors give some explanations or intuitive insights of this trend?\n\n3. Section 4.2. Again, how is the statement \"... reaped the minimum benefits\" is justified?\n\n4. Section 4.2. \"... potential correlation ...\". Is there any further investigations into thie potential correlation? Or is there any intuitions reasons of it?\n\n5. Section 4.2. What is channel collapse?\n\n6. How do the observed phenomenons help explain mixup's working mechanism in improving generalization and calibration? In fact, I think the calibration performance is barely mentioned in the main context."

Given the dimension-specific uniqueness of the regular d-Simplex ETF, further details on the projection process would be beneficial. It should be clarified whether the projection includes all classes or if any are excluded, and if so, whether this exclusion is systematic or random. Employing a pair plot or scatter plot matrix, as referenced in [1], may provide a more conventional representation of the multidimensional data and ensure clarity regarding the inclusion of all classes. Given that datasets such as CIFAR10 and FashionMNIST comprise 10 classes, they could be visualized directly without the need for projection.\n\n[1] Pernici, F., Bruni, M., Baecchi, C., & Del Bimbo, A.

This concept is central to the paper, and a detailed discussion is essential, extending beyond the brief description in Figure 4's caption. Providing clear evidence or a solid rationale for this phenomenon is crucial to enhance the paper's validity.To better understand the amplification effect, it may be helpful to initiate training with a regular d-simplex ETF that is fixed, as in [A] and [B]. By 'fixed,' it is meant that the parameters do not change during the training. This could provide clearer insights into the behavior of decision boundaries.\n\n[A] Pernici, F., et al. (2021).
