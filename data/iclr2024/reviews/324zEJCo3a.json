Since the picture for so-called \"local\" explaianability queries, that aim to explain the behavior of the model on a particular input, has been studied in depth in previous work by Barcelo et al, the paper focuses on \"global\" explainability queries, that aim to find the features that are most relevant for all inputs to the model. In particular, the paper aims to find whether there exists a correspondence between folklore claims on interpretability and the computational complexity of such problems."

So, while I liked the paper, I do not feel like championing it for a conference like ICLR. \n- The paper lacks a unifying take-home message. In particular, it is never speculated or proposed a reason why for some models global explaianability is more difficult than local one, while for others is not. I could easily think of some potential reasons myself, so I am very surprised that the authors have not made it themselves."

This might be related to the characteristics of global explanations (an extra universal quantification in the definition of the notions vs a unique minimal global sufficient reason set) and on the nature of the models themselves (some problems being easily solvable on them). \n\n- I would have been more positive about the paper if the authors would have considered a more relaxed version of global explainability, which seems to be of more practical interest: instead of requiring that the condition holds for every input instance, it could hold for a large fraction of them: say, for 90%, for instance. Can you add something about how your complexity analysis would change if this relaxed notion of global explainability was considered instead?"
