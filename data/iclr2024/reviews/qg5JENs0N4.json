However, it is not actually used anywhere. If it is not applicable to deduce any theoretical guarantee, what is the purpose of proposing such definition? At least for the counterexample proposed in Lemma 4.1 and depicted in Figure 1, the authors should be able to provide any kinds of implications on the (lower bound of) stitching generalization.

If we break down the trajectories collected by policies $\\beta_{h=1}$ and $\\beta_{h=2}$ into transitions, can\u2019t even a supervised method learn something from a virtual trajectory, say, 2-3-4, which was not exactly in the dataset, by only i.i.d. sampling the transitions?

                "value": "- Section 1 (Stitching as goal-state pairs): My understanding of the stitching property is that it is more general: given two partially disjoint trajectories that partially optimal, stitching via dynamic programming can combine the two partially optimal trajectories towards an optimal trajectory. Is your definition equivalent, is it a generalization or is it specific to the goal-directed setting?\n- Section 1 (Limited data vs generalization): You state that this is not a problem of limited data, because \" there can be (state, goal) pairs that are never visited in the same trajectory, despite being frequented in separate trajectories.\" In a way this is a source of limited data, if the \"data\" is a trajectory rather than an experience tuple. I think this is implicit in your argument, but it can be made explicit for clarity.\n- Section 4: (More formal \"Limited data vs generalization\"): I am still not sure how this is different from iid generalization, or how the lemma 4.1 makes this point. My understanding of lemma 4.1 is that there exists a context distribution for which the distribution of states induced by a collection of policies will never be equal to the BC policy. But this is because the policies collecting the data are conditioned on information not available to the BC policy. This induces something like partial observability, which is the source of the problem. Without the context, I do not think this would hold and thus stitching generaliation would be equivalent to iid generalzation. But the problem is, in a sense, limited data: the context is never accessible and hence the data (or information) is fundamentally limited.\n- Section 4 (stitching is not finding an optimal policy): I agree that stitching can help find an optimal policy, but this is besides the point in the context of your setting (offline RL). The question is two-fold, under what conditions: 1) can stitching help find a better policy and 2) does fidning a better policy necessitate stitching.\n- Section 5 (Nearby states) : how important is it that the states are mapped exactly onto the states in the set of experience? For example, you could imagine adding noise to all states and goals, which would therefore naturally stitch several nearby trajectories. Given the fact that you are assuming the space to have a distance metric, it is probably well-behaved so that this is effective.\n- Section 5 (conditions for evaluating stitching): While the first condition is easy to engineer into the problem, the second condition seems problematic. How can you know whether the BC policy has a non-zero probability besides running the experiment?\n- Section 6 (DT + aug?): One interesting approach that is missing is combining DT with data augmentation, seeing as DT is more performant than RvS. Is there any reason why this was left out? Is it computational concerns or a more fundamental limitation.\n- Section 6 (More data): This seems at odds with condition 1 under \"popular datasets do not evalute stitching\".
