                "value": "$\\bullet$ **Comparison with SOTA in PI:** One of the core issues with this paper is the lack of comparison with existing SOTA in PI, SENets [2]. Hence, the claim of the authors for pushing the SOTA in PI is not valid. \n\n\n$\\bullet$ **FLOPs comparison are not included when comparing CNN-based PI:** Another major concern with this paper is excluding the FLOPs count when comparing with CNN-based PI, in Table 2. The authors have included the params counts, which are inconclusive as the parameter counts do not signify anything in the context of PI overheads. \n\nSince this paper, which used MLP-mixer as a backbone network, compares with the prior PI methods, which used CNN as backbone architecture, comparing only the non-linearity overheads does not tell the entire story (when comparing two distinct architecture). Moreover, the FLOPs cost cannot be ignored in PI, as they carry significant latency overhead for end-to-end latency [1]. The assumption of processing all the FLOPs offline is valid only when optimization is performed for a single inference request in isolation. However, in real-world scenarios, private inference requests arrive at non-zero rates, and processing the entire FLOPs offline becomes impractical due to limited resources. Consequently, offline costs are no longer truly offline, and FLOPs start affecting real-time performance, as illustrated in Figure 7 of the paper [1]. This effect can be exacerbated by networks with higher FLOP counts, as proposed by the authors.\n\n\n$\\bullet$ **Ambiguity in timing analysis:** The micro-benchmarking for timing analysis performed in Section 4.3.2 is full of ambiguity.  First, the paper said that it used a 2pc protocol, and then it included CrypTen for benchmarking. Note that Delphi and CryptFlow2 have 2pc implementation; however, CryptTen has 3pc implementation as they used TTP for generating beaver triples in the offline phase. It seems that authors have mixed 2pc and 3pc implementation for their benchmarking. \n\n$\\bullet$ **Lack of any new insight:** The discussion presented in Section 3.1 for the sparsity-inducing property of ReLU, redundancy in global features,  and \"information compounding\" is not novel. See [9]. \n\n$\\bullet$ **Authors are ill-informed about the relevant literature:**  Authors need to tone down the claim for substituting all the ReLUs with polynomials for the first time. Prior work [6, 7, 8] replaced all the ReLUs with polynomials, and some of them demonstrated their efficacy on the ImageNet dataset too. Nonetheless, the prior work required to have higher-degree polynomials [6] or needed to use LayerNorm to mitigate the accuracy drop stemming from substituting all the ReLUs with polynomials [7]. \n\nAlso, on page 9, the authors claim that implementation for offloading private computation to GPUs is not available.
