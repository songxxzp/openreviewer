To this end, the authors first train an autoencoder to bring the motion sequence into latent space and propose to decouple the style and content of the motion in latent space. Specifically, the latent code is mapped to content code and style space via two encoders and then mapped back to the original latent space via a generator equiped with adaptive instance normalization (controled by the style code).  During training, several losses are applied to ensure the disentanglement between the content and style including  the Homo-style Alignment loss, swap and cycle reconstruction loss."

The motion code is enforced to decompose into a deterministic content code and a probabilistic style code. The style code is expressed in a certain formula of distribution. And the generation is performed by an auto-encoder. The method can generate stylized motion in different schemes: unconditional or conditional to certain style label or exemplar motion. Also, the benchmarking results also suggest the good effectiveness and the time efficiency of the proposed method."

Also, the cycle-consistency idea is also interesting."

I would ask for more details and evidence to support this design. The results shown in Table 7 only suggest relatively marginal influence, especially in the supervised settings. Is it possible to also have more results on other datasets?\n- Given multiple components and modules are proposed to construct the proposed method, a complete ablation study is expected to validate their effectiveness. The ablation of loss weights shown in Table 6 is probably not enough to convince readers that all proposed components are contributing to the final improvement of the observed benchmarking results.\n- Question: The results are focused on motion generation in the skeleton representations. Can the authors also propose some visualization with SMPL LBS? With the mesh, sometimes it can be more intuitive to estimate the plausibility of the joint angles."

For the experiments, the metrics may not well validate the performance of the proposed approach. For example, the style accuracy is based on a style classifier, which may be very accurate to capture the styleness of the proposed algorithm. Also, for case with a styled motion input, the transfer result based on the stylized input may not be easily verified. \n\n3. In the attribute edting literature, scholars are actively involved in the style edting, for example, to interpolate two style codes. Is it possible to generalize the generative ability of the proposed approach for more editing operation based on the latent space. \n\n4.
