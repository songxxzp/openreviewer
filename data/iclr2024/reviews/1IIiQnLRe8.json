Since data augmentation can also be seen as a way for preserving semantic information.\n2. The framework is rather complex and requires much hyper-parameter tuning. Thus I have doubt on the applicability of the framework. \n3. Figure 1 shows that multiple intermediate features are used. Also BNSim requires auxiliary data. Does these make the proposed framework fair to compare with other baselines? In my view, the type and number of intermediate features should be aligned. Auxiliary data can be added, but more details should be presented (number, type, construction procedure etc.)."

The overall idea is to better model the diversity, or fine-graininess of features. The starting method, used in previous works, is to obtain some feature vectors, then use a memory bank to quantize them, and then reconstruct the initial samples. High reconstruction errors signify OOD samples. The paper suggests some limitations to this framework and suggests solutions. \n\nProblem 1: all samples are hard to reconstruct due to memory quantization. Solution: proposed BiRDM: demodulate features, to make them simpler, less diverse and similar to memory features then modulate them back to gain back the diversity. This makes all samples easier to reconstruct. \n\nProblem 2: there seems to be a problem that fine-grained features are not smooth enough, and they can generate noisy modulation params, thus a smoothness constraint is proposed.\n\nProblem 3: the features after ConvBN cannot discriminate between ID and OOD data. Although this is helpful for bad reconstruction of OOD data. Nevertheless, a model (BNSim) is proposed that can bypass the memory quantization and still discriminate between ID and OOD samples. This BNSim model is trained by reconstruction on auxiliary data. Then, its output can be compared to the memory quantized output, and the difference can be used as part of the semantic shift detection score."

The method is very complex, with a lot of components where some address the weaknesses but also affect the benefits of other components. The complexity together with the fine balance that the components need means that probably the method is hard to tune. \n\n- W2.2 For example, the memory quantization is used because OOD samples should be harder to quantize thus OOD samples are harder to reconstruct. But BiRDM makes *every* sample easier to reconstruct. There is a fine balance that these two components must achieve, and this could be potentially worrisome as the method could be hard to optimize. I am open to clarification in this regard.\n\n- W3. It is not clear if the compared methods are also using additional data. Is this the case?\n\n- W4. Table 1 mostly presents the results of previous methods in the current setting, as evaluated by the current paper. This can be problematic, as we don\u2019t have a proper comparison to the results as presented in previous work. Hyperparameter tuning and model selection can influence the results to a high degree. The same amount of compute should be invested into hyperparameter tunning/model selection of all methods. Was this the case? \n\n- W5. There are some missing details: such kind of data is used as auxiliary data, what is the exact architecture of the multiple modulation stages, and what is the connection to reverse distillation (Deng & Li, 2022)?\n \n- W6. There are some unclear statements and motivations, as follows:\n\n- W6.1 Referring to smoothness constraint: \u201cIn this way, potentially high (low) reconstruction error for IDs (OODs) can be alleviated.\u201d It makes sense that the smoothness constraint will alleviate high reconstruction errors for *all* samples. It is not clear why it can alleviate high errors only for ID samples but not for OOD samples. Could the authors explain this?\n\n- W6.2 \u201cSmoReg firstly projects diversity feature $z_{diver}$ to a D-dimension bounded diversity representation space by orthogonal matrix P to capture more compact non-semantic factors\u201d. How do we know that this space captures non-semantic factors but it does not capture semantic factors? Is there any constraint to this effect? \n\n- W6.3 \u201cminimizing $L_{smo}$ with aid of enough sampled \\$tilde{z}_{proj}$ (as explained in App. C) ensures smooth non-semantic diversity modeling\u201d. Again, what makes this reflect only the non-semantic diversity, but not the semantic diversity?\n\n- W6.4 \u201cSmoReg targets at smoothing the unoccupied regions in diversity representation space to suppress semantic shifts without affecting the real reconstruction of IDs\u201d. What constraint makes it suppress semantic shifts? Seems like the smoothness constraint would help all kind of diversity (semantic or not) to be better kept in the features. It is not clear how to act differently on semantic vs non-semantic features.\n\n- W6.5 \u201cBN may incorrectly adapt OODs to training distribution with global affine transformation and decrease the feature discriminability\u201d. Why is this a problem, if the BN adapts OOD samples to ID distribution, then the reconstruction error should be high, thus it would be easy to detect the OOD samples. \n\n\n- W6.6 The difference $z_{proto}^{sim} - z_{proto}^{comp}$ between BNSim features ($z_{proto}^{sim}$) and memory quantization features ($z_{proto}^{comp}$) is used as OOD detection score. This assumes that ID samples do not have high quantization error while OOD samples have high quantization error when compared to BNSim features. There seems to be a contradiction here: The authors note that the convBN cannot discriminate between ID and OOD samples but the proposed score only works if the convBN features are quantized differently (such that ID samples result in quantized features with low error compared to BNSim features, and OOD samples result in quantized features with high error compared to BNSim features). Can the authors explain this apparent contradiction?"

                "value": "This paper target at out of distribution detection, specifically focus on the semantic shift. It claims that there is a trade-off between non-semantic in-distribution diversity and over generalization to out-of-distribution semantic shift. The paper lies in the scope of reconstruction-based error detection, and adopts a method that disentangle the representations of non-semantic diversity and the semantic prototypes from input features. Benefit from the non-semantic diversity modeling, the proposed method learns compact prototypical features. Authors conduct experiments on two benchmarks, with suppressing results to existing works."

                "value": "(1)\tThe authors proposed a new technique, that is to demodulate the original input features to remove non-semantic diversity, and thus the model can learn compact semantic prototypes which is helpful for detecting out-of-distribution semantic shift. The demodulation is combined with a modulation layer to better reconstruct the input. The overall technique make sense.  \n(2)\tThe experiments on CIFAR10 show good improvements to existing methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "(1) The presentation needs improvment. There are some unsupported claims. For example, the author claims that there is a trade-off between non-semantic in-distribution diversity and over generalization to out-of-distribution semantic shift, however, as suggested in DMAD[3], the in-distribution diversity is mainly related to covariate shift. Intuitively, to better detect the OOD semantic shift is to learn compact and discriminative prototypical features. The claimed motivation should be doubted according to this. \n(2) The experiments are not convincing, too. The paper only shows improvements on CIFAR10, and on FashionMNIST, authors claimed that it only contains image-level geometrical diversity which is also not supported (i.e., how to measure the claimed \u201cimage-level\u201d or \u201cfeature-level\u201d diversity of a dataset?). The benchmarks used in [1] and [14] should also be considered. What\u2019s more, the ablation experiments are only conducted on a specific class of CIFAR10, why the class is representative? It is important to show the overall-class performance, especially for Table 2.\n[1] OpenOOD: Benchmarking Generalized Out-of-Distribution Detection, NeurIPS 2022.\n[2] Diversity-measurable anomaly detection.
