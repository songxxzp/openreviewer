The authors differentiate this setting from continued-pretraining, which has been explored in past works, because the data selection budget is assumed to be smaller. Their proposed method is then motivated by the key observation that the common practice of selecting data based upon distribution matching may lead to many redundant selections of examples already well-learned from pre-training. Instead, they choose the examples which most effectively nudge the training distribution closer to the target via optimal transport. They then test their method on toxicity prevention and language understanding tasks and compare to previous baselines."

The empirical results on the toxicity reduction are also impressive."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The two main areas of improvement for this paper are (1) presentation, particularly reducing reliance on the Appendix for key details; (2) more thorough experiments/ablations to assess the core aspect of their method (i.e., to me, this is the idea that it is important to \"select data that is not redundant with pre-training\")  \n\n(1) Presentation\n- There were several details that I think are important to share more up front. For instance, in the experiments, it should be clear both (a) what the candidate datasets are; (b) what feature space/function is being used to calculate costs in OT. I also think the different pre-processing steps different methods do to the candidate set should be mentioned. \n- While having an extended related work in the Appendix is fine, it would nice if more of this content could be covered in the main. \n- Some aspects of the notation could also be cleaned up (see Questions below)\n- The All Domains baseline is mentioned on pg. 6 before being defined. \n \n(2) Experiments\n- For the experiments in Sec 3.2-3.3, the improvements from GOT-D over previous baselines don't seem to be that much in most cases (i.e., within standard deviations)? Perhaps the authors can comment on significance here?\n- Currently, it seems there are several differences between DSIR and GOT-D besides just that one does distribution matching and the other finds the most informative examples (given pre-training distribution). Particularly, they both involve preprocessing the candidate pool in and use different feature representations to perform selection (i.e., DistillBERT v.s. n-gram). I think more controlled ablations of these other factors are important to ablate what precisely causes GOT-D to perform better. \n- In the BERT experiments, do DSIR and DAPT/TAPT use the same pre-processing procedure to select relevant domains as described for GOT-D? I'd be curious what happens if this step is left out for GOT-D. \n- It would be nice to show some qualitative examples of what kinds of examples get selected by GOT-D but are not as emphasized in distribution matching approaches (e.g. DSIR)."

            "questions": {
                "value": "(1) In the introduction it is mentioned that *\"Intuitively, fine-tuning a pre-trained model with such samples would boost its performance on the target dataset. We prove the validity of this intuition under certain assumptions, thereby setting our method on a solid theoretical foundation.\"* To me, this suggested there would be a formal theorem statement in the text that explicitly outlines assumptions and a guarantee? Section 2 does describe and link together some existing results in prose but it's not as clear what has been newly proven? \n\n(2) In the toxicity reduction experiments, am I correct in understanding that no methods did the second round of task-specific fine-tuning? If so, I don't think this would change the core conclusion but I think it is still important to include a baseline which trains on just the initial 2.5K target examples. Similarly, it would be nice to confirm that the improvements of GOT-D over other methods persists after doing the fine-tuning round on these examples. \n\n(3) As a general comment, the distinction between the terms \"pre fine-tuning\" and \"continued pre-training\" remains a bit unclear to me. My understanding from the paper is the same methods could be applied to both but the main difference is just how much data is involved. But in some places \"pre-training\" is still used a bit interchangeably (e.g.. *\"This experiment involves two stages: pre-training over selected data and then fine-tuning over the downstream task.\"* in Sec 3.2, pg. 7). What is the motivation for defining the new term as opposed to saying something akin to \"continued pre-training with limited budget\"? \n\n(4) Miscellaneous\n- It seems sometimes $D_S, D_R, etc.$ are used interchangeably to represent (finite) datasets and distributions. Perhaps the authors can make this distinction clearer? \n- In Eq. (3), should the last term of the expansion include $\\lambda \\cdot (D_U - D_S)$ instead of just $\\lambda \\cdot (D_U)$?\n- The version of TAPT here seems to be the \"curated-TAPT\" described in Gururangan et al. rather than \"TAPT\", which I've more typically seen as just training on the unlabeled end-task inputs. Perhaps the authors can add a clarifying note here, or better, include results for both versions of TAPT. \n- In Table 3, it seems TAPT should be bolded for RCT. Also the text right above mentions \"All domains\" but it seems to be missing from the table?"

In contrast, it would be beneficial to evaluate whether using the pre-fine tune set also leads to better performance on a larger model (1/7B+).\n\n* While the performance on toxic detection are strong, these improvements come at the cost of increased perplexity.  Further the (token?) perplexity of these models are quite high.  Regarding the above concern, authors can evaluate on a larger model with reduced perplexity to see if the impact increases perplexity at the cost of decreasing toxicity.\n\n* Authors only conduct limited evaluation on the pre-fine-tuning dataset size at 50K and 150K.  An experiment at different amounts of data from small data to continual pre-training with comparison to prior works can help to better motivate GOT-D as an approach for selecting pre-fine tuning data.\n\n* Part of the motivation appeared to be not needing as much data for the downstream task, however it appears they still need the full fine-tuning data."
