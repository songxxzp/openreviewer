When comparing the performance of BiSAM and SAM, it turns out the improvement in test accuracy is quite minor. Based on the standard deviation provided, it is hard to conclude that the improvements are due to randomness or indeed statistically significant. \n- The motivation behind BiSAM is the benefit of approximating 0-1 loss via BiSAM over continuous surrogate like cross-entropy. The intuition of lower bounding the max part is convincing but I wonder the actual benefit of doing so. In particular, could the authors justify the using of lower bound (11) provides tighter bound than using $L^{ce}$ in the original SAM? I think illustration by a simple synthetic example can help a lot, or through theoretical derivations.\n\n\nOther comments: \n\n- Is the term $-\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\log k$ missing in the right-hand-side of Equation (14)?\n- In the paragraph below Equation (8), what does this sentence mean: ``it would be wrong to simply replace it by cross-entropy\"? I think it is valid to upper bound the right-hand-side of (8) by $L^{ce}$. Is there anything I'm missing?"
