Comparing the uncovered dependence with human annotation, PECoRE can quantify the plausibility of language models.

For any (contextual) generation model, PECORE proposes extracting sets of (target, cue) corresponding to what parts of the generation were reliant on context, and what parts of the context they relied on.\n\nThe framework has two main steps:\n\n1. Context-sensitive target identification (CTI): This step identifies which tokens in the model's generated text were likely influenced by the preceding context. It does this by comparing the model's predictions with and without context using contrastive metrics. \n2. Contextual cues imputation (CCI): This step traces the generation of context-sensitive tokens (for \u201cgold\u201d context-sensitive words or end-to-end from the CTI step) back to specific words in the input context that influenced their prediction. It uses attribution methods to identify influential contextual cues.\n\nThe (target,cue) outputs can then be compared to human rationales to evaluate the *plausability*. Importantly, the PECORE framework is agnostic to the specific method used in the CTI step and CCI step, and authors investigate the plausability of PECORE using different combinations of methods.\n\nThe authors apply PECORE to specific task of contextual machine translation. Experiments on discourse phenomena datasets show the PECORE can identify context-sensitive outputs and trace them back to contextual cues with reasonable accuracy (when compared to human-rationales), particularly when using simple distributional metrics on both steps (like CXMI or KL-divergence). The framework is also applied to unannotated examples in FLORES dataset, revealing interesting cases of context usage in translations."

This means that they can use these \u201cprobabilistic\u201d metrics to measure context on actual decodings/translations of the model rather than on references (which might not be representative of real use of the model).\n- I find the comparison of different contrastive metrics and selectors through PECORE quite relevant, and a useful resource for future intepretability research.

For instance, the Detection component (CTI) and CCI component could potentially function independently, and the potential synergy of combining them within a unified framework remains unclear. Additionally, each component closely resembles existing methodologies[1], with the experimentation primarily focused on various detection metrics. Notably, the paper's most advanced aspect, compared to existing methods, is its omission of reference translations, which may be perceived as somewhat lacking in novelty for an ICLR paper.\n\n- The authors acknowledge limited performance, as indicated by the data presented in Table 1 and Figure 3. They attribute the suboptimal performance to domain shift issues affecting lexical choice. This suggests that the proposed methodology predominantly excels in handling anaphora cases. However, from my perspective, it's worth noting that lexical choice in context-aware translation is a significant aspect, and it's not entirely clear if the approach can effectively diagnose and interpret the model in practical context-aware translation research."
