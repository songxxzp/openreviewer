                "value": "This paper focuses on identifying direct causes of a target variable under possible intervention environments by leveraging the invariant causal prediction (ICP) mechanism. By the basic observations that the prediction error for Y using its causal parents is more minimal than other predictors that contain non-parent variables, the authors present two approaches that learn the invariant set of variables with the smallest error for predicting Y, i.e., MMSE-ICP and fastICP, where the latter method has lower complexity. The experimental results, both on the simulated data and gene expression data, show the proposed methods are able to learn the correct ICP set with increasing samples."

My main concern is how to obtain the minimized MSE in practical application, which is a key issue to the proposed theoretical results and it should be properly proofed if possible.\n\n2. I note that the simulation data is only generated by a linear model. It should be clearly defined if the proposed theoretical results only focus on the linear model. \n\n3. If the non-parents node has no noise term, e.g., X_2=2E and X_1=X_2, it seems that the MMSE(X_1 X_2) is equal to (X_1), which may not ensure the correct ICP set output by the proposed method. In other words, the author should claim the causal model used in this paper, such as SCM or ANM. If my understanding is not correct, can you clarify what generation process assumptions you are making?"

In my understanding, this is because both observed information (utilized by traditional causal discovery method like GES and PC) and interventional information are used. Is this correct? Please highlight and discuss this point more in the paper.\n\n- in the experiment, fig. 5, ICP and the proposed methods have close F1, but ICP's recall is much lower. Does ICP have a higher precision in this case?\n- please use \\citet and \\citep separately. This really affects reading flow.\n\nOverall, I think this paper improves an existing method with both theoretic and empirical validations. The current version is in a good shape and only needs minor edits. I vote for an acceptance."
