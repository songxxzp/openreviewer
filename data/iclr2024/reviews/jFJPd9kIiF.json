                "value": "This work proposes Least Volume (LV) a method that prunes latent dimensions of deterministic auto encoders by the combination of a specific regulariser in the latest space and specific constraints in the decoder. The regulariser is the product of the (empirical) variances of each dimension of the latent code; by encouraging minimisation of this term, the encoder is forced to \u201ccollapse\u201d / \u201cprune\u201d its representations on some dimensions of the latent space. In order for these dimensions to be properly ignored by the decoder, the authors propose to employ a Lipschitz constraint, effectively preventing the decoder from being able to scale up the values of those dimensions. The authors provide several theoretical motivations for LV. Firstly, they discuss how their regulariser connects to volume and how, even though the autoencoder is deterministic, its continuity allows it to learn a topological embedding of the dataset. Secondly, they discuss how a bound on the reconstruction error by pruning dimensions with LV and how LV relates to PCA in the case of linear models. Finally, the authors also generalise the concept of the importance ordering of dimensions from PCA to the case of nonlinear models and LV, by relating the variance on each dimension to the reconstruction error on the output. \n\nThe authors perform some experiments on image tasks where they show how LV is able, for a fixed reconstruction penalty, to produce sparser latent spaces and furthermore perform ablation experiments to verify the importance of the components of LV, the Lipschitz constraint and the regulariser at the latent space."

I like the theoretical discussion, but the paper lacks on the practical side and method-wise, given prior works such as [2], there is only the novelty of the regulariser in the latent space. My questions and suggestions are the following\n- It seems that the only downstream task considered is a KNN classification where the results were a bit underwhelming. I would encourage the authors to do a more comprehensive evaluation of the feature learning capabilities of LV by expanding upon the classification task with linear probing (i.e., learning a classifier on top of the encoder) or other tasks considered in unsupervised models , such as semi-supervised learning, object detection and segmentation. \n- In the experiment discussion, the authors mention that they use binary cross entropy for training, which deviates from their theory, but they perform evaluation with the L2 reconstruction error. Why is there this discrepancy? Furthermore, how is the binary cross-entropy used when you do not have binary data (e.g., CIFAR 10 and CelebA)? \n- The authors argue that the CelebA results do not fit in the main text due to space constraints, however, there is almost half a page empty, so I would suggest that the authors use the empty space to move some more results in the main text."

The authors identify a necessary constraint for the latent representation volume to correspond to disentanglement, namely the K-Lipschitz constraint on the decoder network. Additionally the authors identify the possibility of exploding gradients under vanishing standard deviations and address this via an additional regularization parameter to their loss, which smoothly interpolates between minimizing volume and L1 regularization of the standard deviations. The authors prove that least volume is equivalent to PCA in the case of a linear autoencoder and show empirically that the disentanglement effect also persists for non-linear autoencoders. LV is compared to three other sparsity-inducing loss functions on the latent representation and shown to lead to the best reconstruction error when pruning latent dimensions.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Introduced method:\n- LV requires the autoencoder to be K-Lipschitz, which can be a large constraint in some cases\n- Although the method is novel, the idea of minimizing the volume of the learned latent representations is not, see [PCA-AE](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10851-022-01077-z), [IRMAE](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2010.00679). LV significantly differs from the mentioned papers, as it directly acts on the latent codes and does not require multistage training.Nonetheless, they should be mentioned.\n- The authors mention [Sparse Feature Learning for Deep Belief Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2007/hash/c60d060b946d6dd6145dcbad5c4ccf6f-Abstract.html), but do little to point out the similarities/differences to their method. The regularization term of the latent codes in that work is  \n$L_\\text{vol} = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} \\log(1 + h^2(z_i))$,  \nwhere $h$ is defined in Eq. 6 of the paper (notation was adjusted to fit the notation of the paper under review).\nWhen we regard $h$ as a homeomorphism that just produces new latent codes and center those new latent codes to 0 we get  \n$\\sqrt[m]{\\exp(L_\\text{vol})} = \\sqrt[m]{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (\\sigma_i + 1)}$.  \nThis is equivalent to LV with $\\eta = 1$. \nIf the authors can point out what their contribution with regards to that already published regularization term is, it would in my opinion severely strengthen the case for this work.\n\n\n\n\nWriting:\n- In the related work section the authors describe the invariance of their method to translation of the latent codes. However in the next sentence it is stated that: \"This equivalent latent set is then one that has zero-STDs along many latent dimensions, which is what this work tries to construct\". It is not clear whether this refers to the translated latent set of LV or of aforementioned methods. In case it refers to LV, the zero-STDs are present also before translation (so it has *still* zero-STDs not only *then*). In case it refers to other methods the authors need to elaborate more on the claim that established methods already produce close to zero-STD latent codes in many latent-dimensions and how their method then differs from those established methods apart from allowing for translational invariance, which would not be a strong contribution by itself. In my opinion this would also generally be a good addition to the related works section.\n- In section B.3.3 in the appendix the authors claim that latent STD still correlates well with explained reconstruction if no Lipschitz constraint is applied because the decoder is naturally a Lipschitz function. While this is correct the Lipschitz constant of the decoder can be arbitrarily increased. It is not clear whether the argument of small updates of gradient-based optimization preserving the Lipschitz constant holds after cumulative gradient updates and sufficient training time. The observed effect might well be due to specific training dynamics and model initialization and, while it is interesting to report, a clear conclusion is hard to draw.\n\nExperiments:\n- The autoencoders are trained with BCE loss on image datasets, but are evaluated in terms of L2 reconstruction. I do not see the justification for evaluating the trained models on a different metric than the training target. If there is a reason behind this the authors should clarify it.\n\nIn my opinion, the main weakness of this work is that there is not sufficient methodological comparision to established work in the field to separate the novel concepts from existing ones. If this is amended I would be willing to significantly change my rating in favor of acceptance.\n\n### A few minor suggestions:\n\nIntroduction  \n- \"This openness means for a conditional generative model trained in such Z, if its one prediction \u1e91 is not far away from its target\nz \u2208 U , then \u1e91 will also fall inside U \u2286 Z, thus still be mapped back into X by g rather than falling outside it.\" $\\rightarrow$ this is only true for g with small Lipschitz constants\n- \"Additionally, people also hope the latent representation can indicate the amount of information each dimension has,\nso that the data variations along the principal dimensions can be easily studied, and trade-offs can be\neasily made when it is necessary to strip off less informant latent dimensions due to computational cost\" $\\rightarrow$ This is a good place for some citations\n\nMethodology and Intuition  \n- Figure 1: The arrows are labelled with \"-v\". What does that mean? Is it another abbreviation for LV?\n- Section 2.3: \"...each homeomorphic latent set h(Z) with h \u2208 H must also be an optimal solution to J, thus residing in Z\u22c6\" . $\\rightarrow$ How does this combine with the Lipschitz constraint on $g \\circ h^{-1}$?\n\nTheoretical Analysis  \n- Section 3.2: \"Although some regard an errorless autoencoder as \u201ctrivial\u201d since it only learns an one-to-one representation...\" $\\rightarrow$ citation needed\n- Section 3.2: \"Thus if X is a smooth manifold, then obtaining the least dimensional Z through a smooth autoencoder can provide a lower bound of X \u2019s dimensionality.\" $\\rightarrow$ upper bound \n- Section 3.4: In Proposition 2, define $\\lambda$\n\nExperiments:\n- Figure 2: It might be more instructive if the axes of the figures were swapped. Also a more thorough explaination of the figure and the meaning of the markers in the caption would be nice.\n\nAppendix\n- Section A.4: \"Since S \u22c6 \u2014the volume-minimized S\u2014 is diagonal...\" $\\rightarrow$ refer to theorem 1 here\n- Section B.2.4: Listing the hyperparameter grid for different experiments together is confusing. Separate the experiments where you vary for $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$ visually.

How are the obtained latent set dimensions close to the exact data set dimensions (if known)?\n- How do the overall outcomes, such as latent set dimensions, reconstruction losses, and the correlation between explained reconstruction and the standard deviations of latent dimensions, change when the dimension of the encoding latent space is altered?\n- Is the regularizer computed on minibatch? If so, how is the minibatch estimate reliable? How is this method scalable?\n- What is the meaning of \u2018Raw Data\u2019 in Tables B.7 and 8? Does it represent the performance without regularization? Moreover, why does volume regularization show distinct performance compared to other methods in CIFAR-10 experiments, even if they have similar latent set dimensions and similar reconstruction loss?\n- Is this regularization method only effective in the autoencoder setting? How can this regularization method be extended to other applications?\n\n[Minor comments]\n- $\\mathcal{H}$ is not defined in Section 2.3.\n- There is a discrepancy between the loss function described in Section 5.1 (binary cross-entropy) and the loss types shown in the figures (L2 reconstruction loss).\n- On page 19, Table B.8. -> Table B.6."
