Especially, the model learns to output some reflection tokens that serve different purposes. First, the model would generate a retrieval token to indicate that the current continuation needs external documents. Then with each of the retrieved documents, the model would generate a special token to indicate whether the document is relevant. After generating some text, the model would further generate the critique tokens to indicate whether the generated text is grounded by the document and whether it is helpful for the overall generation. These tokens would then enable controllable text generation during inference. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms several other competitive baselines that are augmented with a retrieval mechanism but do not have the self-reflection step."

Also, GPT-4 might make the decisions on whether to retrieve or not differently from the small LMs as GPT-4 memorizes a lot more world knowledge.

Then the generator is trained on the augmented data, so that it also generates the target response as well as control tokens. At inference time, the decoding algorithm is modified to take actions when a control token is decoded. The authors implemented the framework on top of llama2 7B and 13B, and evaluated the models across various text generation tasks.

I find that hard to believe, given personal experience and reported results, e.g. PandaLM which for their task reports an F1 accuracy of 66% when comparing the quality of different passages. I don't deny that GPT-4 evaluation predictions have a strong positive bias towards the truth, but I still would call it high agreement. Do you have data to support this? Or do you think the gap in observations is due to comparison on slightly different evaluation tasks?\n\n- The repetitive self-reflection methods of Self-RAG will likely have an outsized effect on the computation requirements and the latency of the model.
