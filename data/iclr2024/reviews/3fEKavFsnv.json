                "value": "The paper delves into the ever-growing challenge of differentiating machine-generated texts (MGTs) from human-written texts due to the increasingly sophisticated capabilities of large language models like ChatGPT. The authors highlight the potential risks MGTs pose, especially in scenarios where accuracy and authenticity are crucial. Their primary approach is based on the exploitation of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to discern the subtle distributional discrepancies between MGTs and human texts.\nHowever, a pivotal point of contention is the assertion that directly training a detector using MMD on diverse MGTs leads to a spike in MMD variance. This is due to the potential multiplicity of text populations from various LLMs, which the authors argue could compromise the efficacy of MMD in differentiating the two sample types. In response, they introduce the concept of MMD-MP, a multi-population aware optimization method. This novel solution is said to counteract the variance increases, leading to a more consistent and reliable detection mechanism.\nTwo distinct methods, based on paragraph and sentence structures, were developed relying on MMD-MP. The authors have furnished empirical evidence, demonstrating the superiority of their approach when tested across a range of LLMs.\nWhile the research appears thorough and the problem well-identified, certain areas raise eyebrows. For instance, the premise that MMD variance surges significantly with diverse MGTs warrants further investigation. Additionally, the paper's claim of consistently outperforming all existing baselines across a multitude of LLMs might be viewed with a touch of skepticism until validated by external sources. Nevertheless, this paper's contributions to the realm of MGT detection are commendable and merit attention."

Such thorough testing not only validates their methods but also offers a benchmark for future research in this domain.\n\n3. The paper offers clear theoretical insights, particularly the exploration of the optimization mechanism of MMD and its associated challenges.

The algorithms presented, such as the training deep kernel with MMD-MP (Algorithm 1) and testing with MMD-MP for 2ST (Algorithm 2), are specifically tailored to address the MGT detection problem.

These other attributes are probably more important in real-world applications.\n\nI am not sure whether experiments on such a small training corpus are meaningful. Due to the cross-validation setup, it is very possible that all models that are trained on the corpus are over-fitting to this setting. Baselines like ChatGPT-D that may be trained on much larger external corpora are therefore at a disadvantage. Another potential disadvantage is that the single-sentence detection test is not very realistic; it would have been better to perform this test at the paragraph level. A final problem with the experiment section is that many details are missing - see questions below.\n\nThe proposed method is quite complicated. Apart from complexity of implementation, a potentially large disadvantage is that the loss is quadratic in training corpus size. The authors don\u2019t address this issue at all.\n\nAlthough it has a lot of supporting math, the main contribution is actually a small modification (dropping a term in the loss), that is quite intuitive.

Do you use an approximation to deal with this?\n\nWhere do the different machine-generated populations in 2.2 come from? In what sense is there only a single human population (since there are also lots of different kinds of human-generated texts).\n\nRelated to the above, how is (3) generalized to deal with multiple populations? Do you keep the machine samples separate somehow, or merge them?\n\np6 \u201c... numerous works have shown MMD as a powerful means\u2026\u201d - please provide citations.\n\ns4 What language is the corpus?\n\ns4 What architecture and scale of neural models do you use? Are these the same for your model and all baselines? Which baselines train on the provided corpus, and which don\u2019t? What are the hyper-parameters for the kernel functions? Is there anything about the setting (model scale, data size) that might be optimal for your model but not the baselines?\n\ns4 Please provide more details about how test power was compared for these methods. If it was derived from theoretical estimates for both your methods and C2ST-L, can you be sure both are equally good estimates of the true power?\n\nIn Tables 1-4, ChatGPT has consistently the best results for all methods, indicating that it is easier to distinguish from human text. But one would expect it to be harder, since it is a better model than the others. Do you have an explanation for this?"
