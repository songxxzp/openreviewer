The example on the top of page 2 does not convince me in the slightest, given that in modern applications features are basically never equipped with clean semantics as assumed here.\n3.

However, in modern models the exact value of these weights does not seem to matter very much, as can be seen by the success of quantization techniques. Hence, a much more interesting model of RNNs and Transformers could be one where weights are binary or chosen from a small range (e.g. a 4-bit representation).

I did not check in details the\nproofs in the appendix.\n\nThis paper studies the complexity of two types of interpretability queries, in\nthe setting of formal interpretable AI (FXAI):\n- Computing \u201cminimal sufficient reasons\u201d, also called \u201cabductive explanations\u201d:\n  for a given model M and input x over a particular set of features, compute a\n  minimal set of features such that setting their values to those of x suffices\n  to obtain the same classification as x (i.e., all completions are in the same\n  class as x)\n- Computing \u201ccounterfactual explanations\u201d also called \u201cminimum change required\u201d.\n  Here we want to know what is the minimum number of feature values to change\n  so that M changes its mind on x. In more generality, given a metric m over\n  the possible inputs, one want to find a closest input x to y according to this\n  metric so that y and x are not classified the same.\n\nThese queries have already been studied, but not for sequential models, which\nthis paper does. The models that it considers are RNNs, Transformers, and\nvariants of finite state automata (FSA) for sequences of rational numbers, with\nranges of rationals as transitions (called interval automata), and possibly\nwith registers that can do comparison (k-DFAs if the automata are\ndeterministic and k registers, k-NFAs if nondeterministic). The features are\nregular languages. Metrics considered are Hamming distance, Edit distance, and\nDynamic Time Warping Distance (DTW).\n\nThe results are:\n\n* For RNNs and Transformers\n1. minimal sufficient reason is undecidable\n2. checking the existence of a counterfactual explanation is undecidable for\n   DTW, and NP-complete for Hamming and Edit distance\n\n* For FSAs:\n3. Checking the existence of a minimal sufficient reason is PSPACE hard\n4. For a fixed k, computing the minimal distance of a counterfactual\n   explanation is PTIME over k-DFAs, for all distances mentioned above \n5. computing the minimal distance of a counterfactual explanation over k-NFAs\n   is NP-hard for Hamming and edit distance, and PSPACE for DWT."

The idea of using regular languages\nfor the features is interesting, but it is not clear if this is something new\nthat the authors are the first to propose, or if this has been already\nconsidered elsewhere. The paper is overall well written and relatively easy to\nread (modulo the typos). The topic and results are definitely of interest for\nICLR.

In fact the proof of Proposition 3 stops in the middle, and I could not\n  locate the proof in the appendix  **************** \nThis has to be fixed. This is why I put a soundness score of 2, but if it was only a mistake \nfrom the authors with their latex files during submission and is corrected the soundness score could go higher\n--------> This has been fixed in the updated version\n\n- results 1, 2 and 3 listed above seem to me to be straightforward translations of\n  existing folklore results. While I agree that there is value in translating and stating these results\n  into the world of FXAI, I find it weird to state these as contribution, theorem, etc, when\n  they could simply be observations that derive from existing work\n\n- p2 \"the same problems were shown to be solvable in polynomial-time for\n  decision trees and perceptrons Barcel\u00f3 et al.

                "value": "- Beware that minimUM and minimAL sufficient reasons might no have the same\n  complexity: for instance minimUM is NP-hard over decision trees, but minimAL\n  is trivially in linear time for decision trees. In the introduction you mention minimUM, but in\n  the rest of the paper you seem to use minimAL everywhere. This should be clarified (see also the comment\non NP-hardness of minimum vs ptime of minimal for decision trees)\n\n- p4 why do you forbid an abductive explanation to be empty? I think that your\n  definition is broken and should be fixed as follows: it is simply a minimal\n  (under inclusion) subset of features such that v satisfies all features and all\n  completions are classified the same. If this set turns out to be empty, this\n  just means that the model is constant, and so the \"empty\" explanation simply\n  explains this.\n\n- Proposition 2, and in general: you could also consider the setting where the\n  set of features is fixed, which would give you PTIME for DFAs. \n\nI do not really see the point in spending the\n  space to define RNNs in the main text since you are not really using it in the\n  end...
