The proposed method is not compared with these methods.\n\n2) There is a lack of comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. From the experimental results in Table 1, when compared with newer saved sample methods, the performance improvement of this method has reduced significantly, dropping from 2.86% to 0.8%. However, Foster is not the current SOTA method. For example, [Yan S et al., 2021] and [Chen X et al., 2023] both perform much better than Foster. There is a lack of experimental results with BaA and these methods to prove its effectiveness.\n\n3) The proposed method requires calculating the average value of all previous task models. This means it needs to store all the models from previous tasks, incurring significant amount of memory. Especially when compared with methods that do not save samples, this results in an unfair comparison.\n\n[Xu H et al., 2020] Aanet: Adaptive aggregation network for efficient stereo matching, CVPR2020\n[Simon C et al., 2021] On learning the geodesic path for incremental learning, CVPR2021.\n[Hu X et al., 2021] Distilling causal effect of data in class-incremental learning, CVPR2021.\n[Yan S et al., 2021] Dynamically expandable representation for class incremental learning, CVPR2021.\n[Chen X et al., 2023] Dynamic Residual Classifier for Class Incremental Learning, CVPR2023."
