These models are then fine-tuned to forecast the price and volume of stocks in the S&P500 and CAC40 indices. The authors demonstrate that a na\u00efve baseline outperforms DL approaches on their selected tasks when evaluated using standard forecasting metrics. To address this, they propose an evaluating performance based on the returns and risks associated with using the DL approaches for portfolio management. They find that DL tends to perform better than the baseline under this evaluation."

                "value": "- Although the evaluation of Scinet and DA-RNN on finance data is novel as far as I am aware, the benchmarking of DL on financial data is not novel. For example, [1] evaluates Transformers on several indexes, and also considers the risk/return on trading strategies based on DL forecasts. As the authors point out, their benchmarking submission also does not include comparison to other families of time series forecasting methods.\n\n- While the authors claim to collect a comprehensive dataset, no description is given other than the number of samples. This makes evaluation of the significance and quality of their dataset difficult. Furthermore, while a complete collection of financial price histories could be beneficial to the community, it is ultimately not difficult to assemble publicly available historical price data, making this contribution limited.\n\n\n- I disagree with the author's characterization that the na\u00efve or LAST baseline (predicting the last known point) has been ignored in forecasting of financial time series. See [2], where a widely used textbook states that the na\u00efve approach works well in financial data. Furthermore, the authors should consider the existence of metrics such as the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE), which compares forecast performance against the na\u00efve one-step forecast model. The M3/M4 papers as cited in this submission also perform evaluation against the na\u00efve baseline. While individual papers in the financial forecasting literature (such as [1]) do fail to make adequate comparison, I believe the authors claims that this is a systemic issue needs further support.\n\n\n- The authors are encouraged to add more clarity in the writing of this submission. While the flow and core narrative of this submission is clear, it often does not contain enough detail for critical evaluation. Also, table 3 appears to exceed the allowable margins.\n\n\n[1] Wang, Chaojie, et al. \"Stock market index prediction using deep Transformer model.\" Expert Systems with Applications 208 (2022): 118128.\n\n[2] https://otexts.com/fpp2/simple-methods.html#na%C3%AFve-method"
