                "value": "My general complaint is that this paper feels too much of a technical report rather than a research paper that I would expect to see at a top ML conference. I will elaborate:\n\n- **The motivation is not well-established**. The authors mentioned \"it\u2019s crucial to investigate how training techniques affect privacy\" -- I generally agree with this point, but this is not sufficient to convince me that studying the privacy risk in curriculum learning is important. 1) From a practical perspective, curriculum learning is a relatively niche subject, and is very different from self-supervised learning or unsupervised learning which have attracted extensive interest in the ML community. I'm not aware of any of its real-world applications and am not sure whether privacy is indeed a valid issue within. 2) From a research perspective, the author briefly mentioned \"data ordering could have negative impacts on privacy\" -- this is a valid hypothesis, and could be a good starting point to perform some thought experiments to obtain a more fine-grained argument (e.g., what kind of data ordering, what is the connection to curriculum learning, what data points will be affected the most). Directly jumping to large-scale evaluations based on an unmature hypothesis seems too hasty to me. \n\n- **The structure is weird**. 1) Sec 3 (dataset and model) should be placed right before Sec 5 (the evaluations results), and I feel a paragraph (rather than a section) should be sufficient; 2) the proposed MIA (Diff-Cali) is mixed with other background knowledge on MIAs and AIAs in Sec 4, which is super strange; 3) there are no defense results in the main text yet the defense strategies are mentioned in the abstract, intro and conclusion. Overall this leaves me a strong feeling that the paper contains too many contents and is not well-compiled for reading. \n\n- **Many technical details are missing**. The authors put too many technical details to the appendix, for instance, the MIAs, the defense strategies, and TPR at low FPR. Even the details of curriculum learning is not clearly explained. This will significantly hinder understanding even for people working on the intersection of ML and privacy. Combined with the previous point, I think this paper is more suited for a security conference. \n\n- **The analyses are not sufficiently in-depth**.  Most of the conclusions can be directly drawn from the experimental results, and there are few insights or discussions beyond. For instance, I did not learn much from the AIA experiments beyond knowing that the attack success rate does not increase, and the hypothesis \"sensitive attribute to be inferred is not influenced by data ordering and repeating\" is not backed up by any further evidence. In a few places where the authors tried to offer more principled analysis, I observed a few reasoning gaps. For instance, the authors attempted to use memorization to explain the impact of curricula. However, there is a significant gap between the experimental setting in Sec 5.2 and the actual curriculum learning. More specifically, for curriculum learning as described in algorithm 1, hard samples appear later than easy samples *only in a single epoch*; they do appear in every epochs (and particularly, early epochs) of training."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "- In algorithm 1, it seems that for later iterations in a given epoch (i.e., large $i$), $X_i'$ will still contain easy samples. This suggest that easy samples will still appear in later iterations of training (since $B_i$ is sampled from $X_i'$), meaning that they will have high occurrence compared to hard samples. 1) I'm not familiar with curriculum learning, but I feel a more natural way is to segment the ordered samples (based on difficulty scores) into *disjoint* batches, and then progressively train on them in a single epoch; 2) If you indeed used algorithm 1, then the number of occurrence will be another factor (other than difficulty) that will impact the vulnerability of each sample, and this is not taken into account when designing experiments or drawing conclusions.  \n\n- In Fig 1a and 2a, the harder samples actually have lower attack accuracy and confidence scores (for all curricula and normal training). This is very counter-intuitive and not explained. Particularly, I don't buy the results that harder samples will have low attack success rate for normal training. This makes me doubt that the difficult scores used in this paper is problematic. Also, I think it is misleading to claim that \"harder samples are more vulnerable\". Instead, what you can actually infer from the results is that \"CL will introduce stronger effects to harder samples compared to normal training\" (i.e., the *gap* is large)."
