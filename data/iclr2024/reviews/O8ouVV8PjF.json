                "value": "The authors introduce ShapeConv, an interpretable CNN layer whose kernels function as shapelets, designed for time series modeling in both supervised and unsupervised settings. They demonstrate that using the square norm in convolution, coupled with max pooling, is equivalent to computing the distance between a shapelet and a time series. Within this framework, a convolutional kernel essentially serves as a tunable shapelet. The authors also incorporate regularization to enforce similarity and diversity among shapelets, depending on whether the task is supervised (classification) or unsupervised (clustering). The methodology is validated through experiments on time series classification and clustering, using several competitor models and alternative implementations of ShapeConv for comparison. XAI is assessed via author-selected examples."

                "value": "1. **Lack of Comprehensive Review of Related Work**:\n   - The authors focus exclusively on optimization-based shapelet approaches. While space is limited, notable methods like Random Shapelet Forest and standard shapelet transform should not be omitted. Dictionary-based and interval-based approaches are also relevant and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time series classification, yet they are not mentioned. Furthermore, the competitor models used in the experimental section are largely transformer-based or rely on embeddings, making for an unusual selection. I recommend that the authors thoroughly review relevant literature on time series classification, such as the paper by Ruiz et al. (2021) and models like ROCKET by Dempster et al. (2020).\n\n2. **Ambiguities in the Experimental Section**:\n    - Is the \"Initialization\" phase's cost included in the runtime?\n    - In Table 1, why do the methods differ with respect to the cd plots?\n    - Why is the evaluation limited to 25 UCR datasets, and what was the criteria for selection?\n    - Several state-of-the-art methods like Rocket, CIF, ShapeletTransform, and MUSE are absent from the comparison.\n\n3. **Limitations in XAI Evaluation**:\n    - While the author-selected examples support the paper's claims, they do not suffice to demonstrate the superiority of ShapeConv in terms of shapelet quality. Additionally, pairing ShapeConv with MLP or SVM models does not provide sufficient interpretability. I suggest testing the approach with tree-based or linear models, or employing explainers such as SHAP to determine the importance of shapelets, especially in supervised tasks."

ROCKET, COTE & variants, ...)\n\nBelow are some minor remarks/questions:\n* In Section 1, you write:\n    >  they are more likely to overfit when the signal-to-noise ratio is relatively large\n    * Don't you mean \"is relatively low\"?\n* Initialization\n    * Have you assessed how important it was to use supervised information at initialization?\n    * Have you tried simpler approaches (eg. kmeans++ on randomly selected subsequences of adequate length)?\n* If ShapeConv is faster than LTS, it is probably more an artifact of the implementation since the overall complexity of ShapeConv is probably higher than that of LTS (similar local representation extracted, but ShapeConv have additional loss terms that induce more computations)\n* Presentation\n    * Unsupervised learning: it is unclear from the presentation in Section 3.4 which clustering method is used on top of the features extracted from ShapeConv.

                "value": "This article deals with the classification of time series. The authors describe the equivalence between a particular approach, shapelets, and convolutional layers. They provide several losses to enforce the diversity of learned shapelets and closeness to original data, as well as intuitive initialization methods. The proposed approach is compared to several algorithms in a thorough experimental study."

                "value": "- The main contribution is based on Theorem 3.1, which shows that the shapelet transform is somewhat equivalent to a convolution layer followed by a max pooling operation. However, this fact has been observed previously to provide accelerated shapelet transform: the authors of [1] show that computing the distance profile ($dist(\\mathbf{s}, \\mathbf{x})$ for a given sequence $\\mathbf{s}$ and all subsequences $\\mathbf{x}$ of $\\mathbf{X}$) is equivalent to a convolution. \n\n- An extensive review of time series classification algorithms exists on the same data sets, see [2] and more recently but unpublished [3]. None of the algorithms referenced in [2, 3] are compared to ShapeConv. The authors should at least compare themselves to the best-performing algorithms of the state-of-the-art.\n\n- (Minor comment.) It is considered bad practice to start sentences with mathematical symbols.\n\n[1] Yeh, C. C. M., Zhu, Y., Ulanova, L., Begum, N., Ding, Y., Dau, H. A., Zimmerman, Z., Silva, D.

                "value": "In addition to addressing my comments about Theorem 3.1 and the comparison to the state-of-the-art, I have one question:\n- Convolutional layers are meant to be stacked. Unless I am mistaken, in the experiments, there is only one ShapeConv layer. Would the interpretability of ShapeConv remain if there are several layers?"
