                "value": "The manuscript introduces a novel approach for generative gradual domain adaptation, termed Gradual Domain Adaptation via Gradient Flow (GGF). This method produces intermediate domain data and iteratively adapts classifiers through a sequence of these intermediate domains. The core concept involves creating intermediate domains between the source and target domains by optimizing a Wasserstein gradient flow to reduce distribution discrepancies. The gradient flow specifically aims to minimize three energies (which the Wasserstein gradient flow is decomposed into): \ni) a distribution-related energy for aligning source features with the target\nii) a classifier-related energy to maintain label integrity\niii) a sample-related energy to attenuate noise. \n\nThis facilitates the incremental adaptation of the source classifier to the target domain via fine-tuning processes. The authors offer a theoretical framework to constrain the target error based on the properties of the gradient flow. The efficacy of GGF is supported through extensive experiments on standard Domain Adaptation benchmarks."

                "value": "+ [**Novelty**] The idea of connecting gradual domain adaptation (GDA) and Wasserstein gradient flow is natural, given that previous works have already developed theories of GDA with Wasserstein distance. However, the decomposition of Wasserstein gradient flow into three energy terms by [Santambrogio, 2017] is less known in the machine learning community. The authors managed to apply this decomposition to the GDA problem in a non-trivial way: they relate each energy term with some machine learning notion, and find proper ML loss terms as proxies for these energy terms.\n\n+ [**Theoretical Guarantee**] The theoretical analysis grounds the approach well by providing insight into properties like transport cost and label preservation that are useful for analyzing GDA. Bounding the target error connects the gradient flow construction to actual adaptation performance. This helps justify design choices made in GGF.\n\n+ [**Extensive Experiments**] The method is general and can work with different base classifiers and DA techniques that provide feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets including rotated MNIST, Portraits and Office-Home demonstrate clear improvements over prior arts. The consistent gains across tasks highlight the effectiveness of GGF.\n\n+ [**Visualization**] I quite appreciate the visualizations in Fig. 1, 2, 4, which illustrate the proposed method clearly."

                "value": "+ [**No Explanation of the Original Energy Decomposition**] The algorithm is motivated by [Santambrogio, 2017]'s decomposition of Wasserstein gradient flow into three energy terms. However, the authors only describe them as \"internal, (external) potential, and interaction energy\" without demonstrating their specific definitions. It would be more convincing if the authors can list the original definitions of the energy terms and compare the deviation of their designed loss terms from the original terms.\n\n+ [**Too Many Hyperparameters** ] The loss has three terms, each with a learning rate; there is also an `alpha` term and a `T` term as hyper-parameters. Overall, I feel the number of hyper-parameters is a little high, which may makes the algorithm harder to apply in practice.\n\n+ [**Number of Intermediate Domains should be varied for fair comparison**] In Sec. 5.2, the authors show the improvement of their proposed GGF over GOAT & CNF on the Portraits dataset in Fig. 3. However, the number of intermediate domains in Fig. 3 is fixed to 19. For the GOAT algorithm, its authors demonstrate that the optimal number of intermediate domains for GOAT is below 5, and more intermediate domains may harm its performance. The current choice of 19 intermediate domains might be optimal for GGF, but not for GOAT. So I urge the authors to compare GGF vs. GOAT/CNF across various numbers of intermediate domains (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16)."
