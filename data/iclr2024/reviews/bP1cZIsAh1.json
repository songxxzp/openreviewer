The empirical evaluation can be improved in following aspects: (1) As the proposed can be applied on top of any link predictor, it would be interesting to see whether the method can boost the performance of the baselines method; (2) Given the error bar, the proposed method is not statistical significant compared to baselines. Moreover, AUPRC would be a more sensitive metric under imbalanced labels. (3) All the graphs used in the experiments are small with ten of thousand of nodes.

The PULL proposed with the thought that in real-world scenarios the presence of missing edges is frequently observed. Under this assumption, without the consideration of edge-incomplete graph, it may degrade the link prediction performance. Thus, it is important to consider the uncertainties of the given graph to obtain accurate linking probabilities between nodes. Expecting to propose PULL, this paper conducts a theoretical analysis of PULL, studying its relationship with the EM algorithm. The PULL achieves state-of-the-art link prediction performance. In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\tProposing PULL, an accurate method for link prediction in graphs\n\tConduct a theoretical analysis of PULL, studying its relationship with the EM algorithm.\n\tThrough the experiments on five datasets, PULL achieves state-of-the-art link prediction performance\nThe manuscript demonstrates notable originality with the introduction of a new method named PULL. This method has potential implications in the domain of graph data mining, which could be of considerable significance. In terms of linguistic presentation, the article is well-composed. The flow between sentences appears logical, making the content coherent and accessible to the reader. The authors have taken care to provide a structured proof of PULL, which strengthens the paper's theoretical grounding. Regarding the experimental section, the authors have provided a detailed description of their experiments, followed by an in-depth analysis of the data. \nOverall, this paper could be a significant algorithmic contribution, I would be willing to increase the score."

The basic idea is to treat all edges as positive samples while treating all non-edges as unlabeled rather than negative samples. They then use a graph convolutional network (GCN) as a link predictor to predict edge probabilities for all the non-edges (unlabeled samples) and turn the ones with the highest probabilities into edges for the next iteration of learning. (In this sense, it shares some similarities with self learning, where predictions are used as labels to re-train a classifier.) The authors further demonstrate an equivalence between their learning algorithm and the well-known expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm under an independence assumption. They show improved link prediction accuracy on several real data sets and demonstrate that they typically achieve maximum accuracy at around the true number of edges in a graph.\n\n*After author rebuttal:* The authors have done a thorough job of answering the reviewers' questions and addressing their concerns with a much improved revision.

Why keep the top $K$ with the highest predicted probabilities? It seems like taking some sort of random sample based on the probabilities might be a better approach to avoid too much self reinforcement, which could lead to oversmoothing.
