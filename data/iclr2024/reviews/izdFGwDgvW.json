The top-k predictions are weighted from the caption predictions and image predictions for improved classification and correcting any mistakes from the image classifier. \nExtensive experiments show ICE provides consistent improvements of around 0.5% on average and up to 3% on challenging datasets when added to existing state-of-the-art baseline methods for both zero-shot classification and few-shot fine-tuning."

Generating captions from a stronger vision-language model (such as BLIP) and then combining those captions with image predictions could help to make caption selection more robust.\n\n- Determining the optimal weight between image and caption probabilities seems challenging. Would a learning-based approach that adaptively learns weights for each branch work better?  Exploring other ways to set this weight adaptively could strengthen the approach and give more insights into how failure can be handled.\n\n- There is no comparison to other ensembling techniques that could provide diversity. While the motivation behind using captions to improve the OOD is interesting, the improvements from the model are small which raises two questions - a) are the captions generated the main problem, or b) are the way they are used to correct the prediction? A more descriptive SOTA captioning model would help in answering the first question and hence lead the way to design better ensembling techniques."

Moreover, for certain datasets like INet-Sketch, the baseline actually performs better.\n- Image captioning poses a greater challenge compared to image classification because, particularly for complex images (including some found in ImageNet) a single image may not correspond to just one correct label. Consider, for instance, the top-right picture in Figure 5 labeled as \"strawberry.\" Labeling this image solely as a strawberry seems inaccurate. More broadly, it's impractical to use images featuring multiple objects for a single-label classification. Image captioning is the suitable approach for these types of images. Pushing for precise classification on such images may simply be tailoring models to fit benchmark datasets without truly enhancing their comprehension of the images. Therefore, I don't see how their approach can be applied for complex images. I agree that this approach works for simple images, but I'd assume the existing image models already work well for such cases, as evidenced by Table 1 and 2.\n- In Section 4.3, \"Understanding Why ICE Provides Improvements,\" the explanation is merely qualitative, based on just four examples. It's difficult to gauge the representativeness of these cases.
