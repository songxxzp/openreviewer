Synthetic data is of growing interest for researchers training LLMs, with recent works (tinystories, phi-1.5, tinyGSM) showing small models achieving impressive results when trained on high-quality synthetic data. Currently, CAS to generate training data is underexplored as far as I'm aware, and I have been following this literature.\n\nThis framework should scale well without requiring a strong teacher model to generate data (like tinystories et al, which use GPT-4). Moreover, the solutions are much more likely to be correct than when sampling from a teacher LLM, which is much more prone to errors than an established CAS."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "In its current form, the paper is quite hard to understand. The core technical bits are confusing (perhaps too much delegated to the Appendix). For example, I can't tell much about how the sampling procedure works. This is very important, because it's highly non-trivial to sample symbolic problems with reasonable complexity and diversity. If I understand, what is sampled is always an equation, so of the form L = R. Then, L and R are sampled from a grammar with 18 operators, some unary, some binary, some terms with arity 0 (variables? constants?). These operators include 'integral' and 'derivative', and trigonometric functions, so the problems span algebra, calculus and trigonometry. If this is the case, it seems extremely unlikely to generate valid problems na\u00efvely, and right now 3.2 does not clarify this, or how often the procedure works and fails, or how many of the problems end up being of each kind (algebra, calculus, a mix, etc). Without these, I have little intuition for how the data looks like.\n\nI'm also confused by what the tasks actually are. The paper describes two tasks as \"classification\", but if I understand them, they are not about classification in the classical sense (of labeling examples with a given finite set of labels). Perhaps the questions generated are multiple-choice. If that's the case, I'm missing what is the number of options, and this determines what is chance performance, which I need to interpret the results. I was hoping the Appendix would contain actual prompts, but Appendix A only has a high-level template. In either case, classification or generation, it would be helpful to include an actual example of a task. Figure 1 supposedly has an example, but I can't tell what the model receives and what it has to predict.\n\nOverall, my main concern is about the choice of tasks to generate and evaluate. The tasks seem a bit arbitrary, and they don't seem to assess mathematical _reasoning_ in a meaningful way. If you want GPT-4 (or 3.5) to compute an integral, you'd ask it to do it step-by-step before outputting an answer. If computing an integral is one of the tasks here (seems to be what \"Calculus Classification\" refers to), it seems like the task format is to predict the result in a single step, like was done in Lample & Charton, 2019, who trained a seq2seq model for this. This is incompatible with modern evaluation of LLMs in reasoning tasks, since we know direct prediction won't work very well, not even in simpler tasks like GSM8k. Now, since both GPT-4 and even SciBERT get high numbers in Table 1, the proposed tasks must be simpler than I thought, then, for direct prediction to work at all. In either case, this makes me unsure about what reasoning capability is being evaluated from the models, which is supposed to be the main contribution of the paper."

How long does it take to generate one valid example?\n- What is the distribution of \"kinds\" of problems that are generated? I'm assuming not all of them involve calculus, for instance.\n- What is the simplest kind of problem you generate? Would those be solving linear equations on one variable?\n- For prompting gpt-3.5 and gpt-4, did you use direct prediction, or do you ask the model to generate a chain of thought first?"
