The method has three steps: 1) Adaptive weight perturbations before pruning to push unimportant neurons into flatter minima, reducing the impact of pruning them; 2) Pruning unimportant neurons based on any criteria; 3) Sharpness-based optimization after pruning for overall robustness. Experiments on image classification and object detection show AdaSAP outperforms SOTA pruning techniques with higher robustness while maintaining accuracy. Analysis indicates AdaSAP results in flatter loss surfaces, explaining its robustness advantages. By effectively unifying sparsity and robustness through sharpness, this exploration presents a promising direction for robust and efficient models."

Nevertheless, there are a lot of works that have reported competitive robustness results, such as [a, b]. It is better to discuss or include these SOTA results into comparisons.\n[a] \"Understanding the robustness in vision transformers.\" ICML 2022.\n[b] \"Robustifying token attention for vision transformers.\" ICCV 2023.\n\n3. While the proposed AdaSAP method demonstrates notable effectiveness in concurrently optimizing sparsity and robustness, it is better for the authors to include a discussion of other relevant works that aim to achieve such dual objectives. This would provide readers with a better understanding of where AdaSAP stands in this field and allow for comparisons with existing literature.\n4. In the experiments on image classification, evaluating AdaSAP on additional pruning criterias would provide a more comprehensive assessment the effectiveness and generality of AdaSAP.\n5. The experiments and analysis on object detection are inadequate with only one model. More detection models should be evaluated. Furthermore, comparisons with other pruning methods are needed to further verify efficacy."
