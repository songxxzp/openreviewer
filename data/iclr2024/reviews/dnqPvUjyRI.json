Previous pseudo labeling based methods are limited to pre-defined schemes or complex hand-crafted policies specially designed for classification. To address this, the authors present the Semi-supervised Reward framework (SemiReward), which assesses and chooses high-quality pseudo labels through predicted reward scores and is adaptable to mainstream SSL methods for both classification and regression tasks."

The rewarder network predicts scores to filter pseudo labels for the student training, and the generator network generates fake labels (to provide the rewarder with a variety of scenarios, including incorrect ones, so that it learns to distinguish good data from bad more effectively without affecting the training of the student network) that only train the rewarder. The paper proposes a two-stage training pipeline: 1) pre-training both the rewarder network and a generator network on a labeled dataset, 2)  the reward network is trained on a smaller, random subset of the labeled data along with selected unlabeled data. Empirical results on NLP, Vision and Audio datasets show the effectiveness of their framework."

If such a rewarder function is effective can one infer the labels for unlabelled data by simply choosing the label that maximise the rewards score given an input sample? In addition, one may also infer the labels for testing data in the similar way. If this is true, does it mean one can use directly use the rewarder function for inference?\n\n2. According to Fig. 7, the semi-supervised training stage still requires a hard threshold to generate pseudo labels. The proposed method does not reduce the overall amount of hyperparameters to tune compared against existing SSL baselines.\n\n3. It is unclear the definition of fake label. Does it mean the fake label must deviate from the ground-truth label? But the objective of Eq (7) seems to encourage the fake label to be consistent with ground-truth label. There is not enough clarifications here.\n\n4. The current design seems to mix student model f_S with generator. Such a design may affect the training of student model."
