To this end, the authors first form an augmented Granger Causality model, named TBN-Granger Causality, which adds time-respecting Bayesian Networks to the time-lagged Neural Granger Causality through a bi-level optimization, such that the overlooking of instantaneous effects in typical causal time series analysis can be addressed."

                "value": "1. The authors ignore a large number of recent excellent graph convolution or graph attention models for time series prediction. It is worth mentioning that the classical baseline DCRNN is the result of 2018 years of reporting and is almost outperformed by current solutions. Obviously, it is difficult for the authors to complete the comparison of SOTA algorithm in such a short rebuttal period. Therefore, I believe that the experimental results of the manuscript cannot fully illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nInterestingly, recent studies [1-2] in spatiotemporal representation learning (from the perspective of the equivariance [1] and latent fields [2]) have investigated the common characteristics among for related tasks, such as traffic, physical simulations, motion tracking.\n\n[1] Miltiadis Kofinas, et al., 2021.

It contains many spelling, grammar and other use-of-language mistakes that make it very difficult to discern the authors' intent and extremely difficult to follow the paper.\n- Many important issues are handled with an off-hand approach. For example, see the citation of EVT for 'inspiration' or the expression of Thm 3.1. The theorem posits that \"under standard causal discovery assumptions\" the full causal graph can be recovered. Depending on what these assumptions are, this theorem may be a groundbreaking discovery. However the \"proof sketch\" of Thm 3.1 simply cites the source paper and does not construct any formal argument.\n- Another example is the continued reference to \"tensors\" as being able to represent higher dimensional time series. This is the opposite of why tensors are conceptually used. Take the toy example of a 3x3 matrix and a 9-dimensional vector. Formally, there is nothing more 'high-dimensional' about the matrix.\n- My final critique is on the experiment setup. The experiments contain no simple / naive baselines for forecasting or for anomaly detection. For such a complex architecture proposed, there is only a very limited ablation study to show which parts of TacSas are critical to its success."
