If so, what is the difference between $y$ and $x$?\n2. What does \u201cproposition\u201d mean in this paper? Are they claims with proofs? They seem to simply be declaring or defining something.\n3. In Prop. 2, what does it mean to say that \u201cthe identification of the causal effect $p(x \\mid do(y_c))$ provides the recipe to control for dependencies between the generating factors producing entanglements through a combination of d-separation constraints and data from $p(x, y)$\u201d? Further, does this imply that $p(x \\mid do(y_c))$ is the desired query of interest? And is the discussion about d-separating $X$ from $Y$, or is it about d-separating some variables of $Y$ from other variables of $Y$?\n4. How exactly is ReI defined (as in Prop. 3)? Is it the second term of Eq. 2? This could be clarified better.\n5. What is the motivation of having the objective of $p(z \\mid x, do(y)) = p(x \\mid z)p(z \\mid do(x))$? How was this derived? If Bayes rule is used here, doesn\u2019t that drop $p(x \\mid do(y))$? Also, these terms seem very different from what was introduced earlier.\n6. Is Prop. 4 an assumption? This has to be clarified.\n7. What exactly is the issue of collider bias with other approaches, and how does this approach avoid it?\n\nSome factual issues are highlighted below. There may be more that I did not catch due to the clarity issues from above.\n1. The factorization in Eq. 1 is not enough to argue that a DAG is causal. For example, the graph $X \\rightarrow Y$ factorizes as $P(X, Y) = P(Y \\mid X)P(X)$. However, the same equality holds even if the graph is $X \\leftarrow Y$, despite having a different causal interpretation. It must be clarified that the arrows of the DAG represent causal relationships.\n2. Def. 3 is not quite accurate. Some causal queries can be identified even without a  d-separating set.\n\nFor these reasons, I cannot recommend acceptance of this paper."

Moreover, the fact that ReI could be introduced to the VAE regularizer given by the KL divergence without affecting the likelihood ensures the separability of the two, paving the way for ReI to be applied to additional frameworks, which could be of interest to the community."

However, as mentioned in the paper, the $\\beta$ scalar in $\\beta$-VAE (and related approaches compared in the experiments) controls the strength of enforcing the latent prior such that the DCI scores might heavily depend on the selected value. It would be good to see the values selected for the different datasets and the effect of selecting a few different scores on the results (or at least to know that the selected $\\beta$ was the best-performing one from a set of values).
