The problem of inaccurate and noisy gradients is a well known problem and several people have proposed alternative solutions: (1) DiGS : Divergence guided shape implicit neural representation for unoriented point clouds (2) Given the high cost of dense point cloud capture, can we use sparse point clouds?\u200b (3) Use a local region prior to generalize to various unseen local reconstruction targets\u200b (4) NeuFENet: Neural Finite Element Solutions with Theoretical Bounds for Parametric PDEs (5) mechanoChemML: A software library for machine learning in computational materials physics. These are just a few examples of how people try to use other approaches to compute the derivative than, the approach that authors take. While the authors may and probably will try to defend the paper saying that these papers are not relevant, I would argue that they are. For example: [2] uses the nearest neighbors idea to compute SDF and update the derivative (using AD of course). [4,5] use Lagrange polynomials from Finite Elements to evaluate the gradients for backprop, [1] solves the AD noise problem by adding an additional loss for having zero divergence. Each of them are valid alternative approaches to what the authors of this paper are planning to do. A good paper would try to compare with them and ensure that their approach is truly necessary.\n\n- **Computational cost** - The method seems to be completely based on a pre-trained network. Which means, the model is essentially being trained twice. \n\n- **moving target problem** - if the authors use the pre-trained model as a reference, do they assume that pre-trained model is good enough to approximate the properties? Do they consider, updating the weights of the pre-trained model after say 1000 iterations? (just like it is done in DQN-type algorithms?). This could be a great concern if the noisy gradients dont allow the model to converge to a solution at all.\n\n- **Instant-NGP** - It seems that all the experiments from the author are using Instant-NGP as their baseline and working further from there. Naturally, there are issues with Instant-NGP that the multi-resolution hash encoding is not well understood in terms of derivatives. Some recent papers provide some mathematically sound hash encodings for AD (In Neus or Neus++ paper I think). Therefore, doing the experiments using some non-hash-encoding-based methods like SIREN or Nerf (although time-consuming, would be better).\n\n-**Comparisons** - comparison with Finite-Difference (which is already built-in inside Instant NGP) and AD is like a typical strawman approach where you choose several approaches and rigorously test them is missing. I would like to see more than this.\n\n\n-"
