                "value": "In this paper, a novel dual graph transformer architecture is proposed for flexible body collisions. The underlying architecture is built by combining a traditional Collision Mesh Transformer (CMT) with a novel hierarchical dual-branch attention Hierarchical Mesh Transformer (HMT) to enable long-distance interactions that are important for collision dynamics. The paper evaluates their contributions on four datasets (representing different classes of interaction dynamics), showing how the proposed method outperforms existing Graph Transformer (GT) and MeshGraphNet (MGN) architectures in all cases. The authors furthermore perform some ablation studies for some aspects of their methodology on the same datasets. Finally, the authors conclude by pointing out some limitations addressable in future work, e.g., including learnable pooling methods."

The results show a clear benefit to using the proposed transformer-based architecture on the chosen datasets. Furthermore, the authors provide a new dataset useful for future research.\n\nThe writing of the overall paper is good, and the explanations are mostly straightforward to understand from a linguistic standpoint, but not several questions arise when reading the paper.\n\nRegarding Significance: On one hand, the authors state that the proposed network could be useful in product design (as stated in the abstract and conclusions), which is seemingly a positive aspect, but this is difficult to verify from the submission. On the other hand, the usage of two separate graph transformers with different architectures, i.e., non-hierarchical and hierarchical, seems an interesting point that could be explored in other applications areas as well."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The overall approach of the paper seems technically sound, but there are several points in the paper that raise questions that should be addressed. Furthermore, the core contribution of the paper is not really clear enough, as it is not clear how novel the use of the double transformer architecture is. The authors point out that several hierarchical approaches already exist in the literature (in the related work section), but it is not clear how different they are from the proposed architecture. Furthermore, the datasets are not easy to understand just by looking at the provided information, i.e., what is actually happening in the impact plate scenario? The following is a list of concerns, weak points and linguistic problems in the paper that the authors could take to heart and clarify if possible (not listed in order of severity):\n- In the abstract, the authors mention that their proposed 'unique flexible body dynamics dataset'  is commonly used for product design. It is not clear how such a dataset is useful for product design, and the use of the word 'commonly' combined with a 'unique dataset' seems contradictory. The authors should clarify how this dataset is useful.\n- The authors claim that GNNs are capable of 'intelligently distributing computation to areas of interest', but this seems somewhat dubious as a claim without any reference to support the argument.\n- The authors claim that classic GNNs 'cannot quickly propagate the influence of collisions over long distances' and justify this by a requirement of needing multiple GNN steps to propagate information. However, hierarchical mesh transformers, as pointed out by the authors in the related work section, are clearly capable of addressing such issues already. Furthermore, the proposed architecture also requires multiple propagation steps.\n- It is unclear how Figure 2 is different from existing hierarchical transformers\n- What is 'N' when describing the computational complexity of Transformers?\n- In the related work section, the authors describe that GNNs are 'expected to be applicable to all systems', but this is clearly not the case, as the authors already demonstrate in their results. This should be clarified.\n- The authors state that slow propagation leads to unnatural dynamics, but this does not seem obvious. If propagation is slow, couldn't one add more layers until the same receptive fields and propagation distances are achieved?\n- What is a \"contact edge\", and how are they computed? The explanations in Section 3.2 are very sparse, and this seems to be a central point of the paper. Also, do they include self-interactions or not?\n- The authors mention 'the concatenated features mentioned earlier', but the discussion on features is moved to the appendix. This should be streamlined.\n- What is the meaning of the double hat notation in (3)? This is made more confusing by the authors using the hat for a pre-layer norm and later using a dot + hat combination in the decoder and updater paragraph.\n- In (1) and (2), the authors should make use of \\left( and \\right) in latex.\n- The authors mention that in 'fluid dynamics, node, and edge lengths are always fixed', which is not true in Lagrangian simulations, e.g., in the CConv approach by Ummenhofer et al.\n- The authors note that Figure 6 'shows that as the level increases, shortcut message passing is possible in our method', but this is not really clear from the figure, e.g., is this related to intra or inter-body messages or both?\n- The self-attention maps shown in the main paper and appendix do not provide many insights into the learned behavior and are not very intuitive to understand.\n- Figure 7 should include colormaps.\n- The use of a scaling factor for the results in Table 2 is not ideal and very confusing to read right next to unscaled results in Figure 9."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "- Most importantly, how different is the proposed HCMT architecture from existing hierarchical models? Is the novelty just in using contact edges, using a transformer, or something else?\n- From the descriptions, it is unclear how contact edges are computed, i.e., are they based on a radius search? And if so, what search radii are used? What influence does this have on the achieved results, and would using a non-hierarchical transformer with a similar search radius perform well? Also, how large is the used radius in relation to the mesh elements? The appendix makes some mention of a parameter gamma (Table 8), but this parameter seems to vary significantly between datasets, but there is no clear argument as to why this is the case either.\n- A significant concern with the dataset is the apparent exclusion of two trajectories where stress singularities occur. These seem to exist in the solver used for the data generation, so shouldn't a neural network that learns a simulator's behavior be expected to also lead to the same results? Picking and Choosing from datasets is not ideal, and the authors should include a comparison of the different methods with and without these singularities. If the proposed method works best with and without these singularities, then they should be included; if the proposed method works worse than existing methods if they are included, then this should be discussed more straightforwardly.\n\n- Figure 2 and Figure 4 seem to conflict with each other. Figure 2 shows how the interactions appear to be computed simultaneously for different distances, whereas Figure 4 shows how the different levels of the hierarchy are computed one after another. Which one is used and why?\n- The authors mention that they 'clamp' values for numerical stability, which seems important but is not further discussed. Similarly, the authors mention that they use a pre-layer norm, denoted by a hat, but (4) uses another layer norm after applying the transformer?\n- Are the pooling operations performed globally or only per body? The figures seem to indicate the latter, but the text is unclear.\n- Table 3 raises some concerns regarding the reproducibility of the results. First of all, it is unclear how many seeds are used for all evaluations and how the standard deviations are computed, e.g., are they computed within an evaluation dataset or across different seeds? Furthermore, for example, Table 2 shows a position and stress RMSE for the deforming plate of 7.49 pm 0.07 and 4,535,956 pm 49,937, respectively. Whereas Table 3 shows a position RMSE of 7.37, which is 0.12 away from Table 2, and a stress RMSE of 4,475,616, which is 60,340 away from Table 3. Both results, thus, are outside of the given standard deviation. Why is this the case?\n- Why does the error increase significantly with more levels for the deformable plate scenario? The authors note that a decrease in levels decreases the RMSE, but this does not really seem sufficient as not having any levels would mean that there is no need for long-range interactions, which should also be possible to do using MGN, but MGN performs worse than even the longest-range HCMT network.\n\n============\n\nI want to thank the authors for the detailed information and the updates. Overall, I'm still leaning towards the positive side. I would like to slightly update my score, but given the discrete steps I will stick to the current one and let the AC know about my \"slight raise\"."

                "value": "This manuscript presents a novel mesh-based network architecture, Hierarchical Contact Mesh Transformer, that focuses on flexible body dynamics, which can have large amount of non-linear effects (e.g., collision) in a short time. Using a specially designed mesh pooling layer and a hierarchical architecture, HCMT can do long-range interaction directly and propagate information efficiently. The authors compared HCMT with other baselines using previous datasets and showed that HCMT outperforms them."
