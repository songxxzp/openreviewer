Furthermore, it is crucial to determine whether a given set of orthonormal basis functions retains their orthonormality after applying this technique.\n\n2. How does having more parameters than DMCF help here? Because even if you are learning more coefficients, the basis functions are constrained. So, in terms of expressivity, wouldn't the two methods be the same?\n\n3. Did you directly use the even and odd Fourier Basis for symmetric and anti-symmetric basis functions (after proper modification of the 0 frequency)? If not, what is the explicit equation of the SFB? And if so, Do you think, with proper regularization, filters with Fourier basis will be able to learn proper symmetric and anti-symmetric kernel?\n\n4. In Figure 2, we can see that with a high number of basis functions, Fourier even (or odd) is outperforming DMCF. What might be the reason for it?"
