                "value": "* The main limitation of the proposed approach, in my opinion, is that it misses the goal of the paper (or at least the one that was presented). I acknowledge that in some cases, mainly in low-dimensional settings or on simple datasets (e.g., MNIST) it works fine. However, the main goal of learning transferrable representations is from big, complex, and high-dimensional datasets. Currently, this approach doesn't fit these types of data, and I am skeptical if it will ever will as FEM is not a new idea. Hence, at least currently, I do not think this paper can make an impact as the authors imply in the paper. Nevertheless, I do appreciate novel and non-standard directions, even if they are not mature yet, and I give the paper credit for that.  \n* Another possible limitation relates to the fact that the method doesn't have any learnable parameters. Often there is a domain shift between the dataset for learning representations and the dataset of interest, or between the training set and test set. Standard NN-based approaches can work well in such cases (depending on the magnitude of the shift) or can be adjusted to these shifts by fine-tuning the feature extractor, for example. Yet, as the proposed method heavily relied on the algorithm for obtaining a multiscale mesh based on the training set, it is not clear how it will work in such cases.  \n* I expected to see a broader reference to kernel methods, but the paper seems to miss this related research direction entirely. Kernels also form a basis function and are also universal approximators, and perhaps there is some connection to the Lagrange basis function. More importantly, I find two studies particularly relevant (to address and compare to). First, the line of research on infinite-width NNs [1, 2] which also hinges on inner products in the input space. Second, the method presented in [3] also suggests to use simplices for approximating the full data kernel. When does the proposed approach preferred over these modeling choices? \n* Regarding the experiments, it is not clear what is the test performance of the proposed approach on MNIST. If it is 97.25% as implied in the text, how is that equivalent to 6-layer CNN when even a standard LeNet reaches ~99.3% accuracy?  \n* In my opinion, some information is missing. Specifically,\n  * A reference (or a proof) for the two properties of the Lagrange basis function in Section 2.\n  * Intuition on the dimensionality reduction technique in section 3.2.1.\n  * Why is the following true $(n_t/d!)^{1/d} = \\mathcal{O}(h^{-1})$?\n\n[1]  Lee, J., Bahri, Y., Novak, R., Schoenholz, S.

Yet, there exists few, if any, quantitative comparisons between the proposed method and neural network approaches, especially for the (toy) computer vision and NLP experiments.\n- In fact, the basic 2-layer convolutional network, for instance taken from the PyTorch tutorial page (https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/main/mnist), already achieves 98% accuracy on MNIST in the first epoch (outperforming the proposed approach), which completes in under a minute on a CPU and presumably orders of magnitude faster on GPU. \n- Sec 3.1.2 compares against neural networks when fitting distributions drawn from 2-dimensional distributions, but it is not stated what network parameters nor training parameters are used other than the fact that it is a MLP. \n- It seems that in Table 1, Random Forest is already highly effective at achieving almost perfect R^2 scores, and performance on most of the distributions considered appears to have already saturated.\n- How did the projection layer in Sec 3.2.1 arise? There is no explanation for why this specific projection equation was introduced, and while it claims to contain \u201cno trainable model parameters\u201d, it appears to require careful hand-crafting as well.\n- Speed is touted as an advantage of the method, but there exists no wall-clock timing comparisons for computing the proposed embedding.\n\n\nMinor comments\n- Eqn (2) $y^{(j)}$ should be $y^{(i)}$ instead\n- In Sec 3.3, does \u201cthe neural network\u201d refer to the proposed method (i.e. typo)?
