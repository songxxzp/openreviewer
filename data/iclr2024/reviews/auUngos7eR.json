                "value": "The paper explains how sequentially optimising the likelihood of a nonlinear time-series estimation problem with any given optimiser can be interpreted as implicitly (point-)estimating the solution of a specific filtering problem.\nThe difference to existing interpretations of filtering algorithms through the lens of optimisation problems (e.g. the iterated extended Kalman filter) is that the proposed approach only requires access to an optimisation routine, a sequence of likelihood functions, and the mean of a temporal transition model.\n*The Kalman filter's need for prescribing process noise covariance functions of the temporal transition model is replaced by the need for prescribing optimisation algorithms.*\nMost popular optimisation algorithms scale to high-dimensional settings; most Kalman filter variations do not (because they use covariance information).\nThis approach takes inspiration from a result by Santos (1996) that states the equivalence between truncated gradient descent and solutions of least-squares-type problems.\nThe scalability of the resulting algorithm is demonstrated, among other things, by applying the method to a high-dimensional state-space model representing the weight space of a neural network."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While I do like the paper, I think that the algorithm/presentation has some (minor) issues:\n\n1. **From linear to nonlinear problems:** For linear problems, Santos (1996) shows that a choice of a (truncated) gradient descent corresponds to an implicit choice of predictive covariances.\nThus, for linear problems, estimating the filtering-mean by applying a suitably truncated version of gradient descent \"makes sense\" -- provided the prior model implicit to the length-scale in gradient descent \"makes sense\". Using the same idea for nonlinear problems, arbitrary optimisers, and possibly optimisers with momentum is, technically speaking, a leap of faith, and there is nothing to support this transition other than \"it seems to work well on the test problems\". Fortunately, it does seem to work well on the test problems. (Unless one chooses to use AdaDelta, that is.)\n\n2. **Sensitivity to misspecification:** I am unsure about how, in some parts of the manuscript, the paper describes the implicit MAP filter to be robust against misspecification of the prior. For example, the last paragraph on page 6 reads:\n\n    \"Since the Implicit MAP Filter does not explicitly use the process noise $Q_t$, there is no sensitivity to misspecification, as indicated by the empty columns in Table 1.\"\n\n    I think this statement might be somewhat misphrased because choosing the \"wrong\" optimiser is not unlike prescribing the wrong process noise covariance. \n    In other words, while the implicit MAP filter is, by construction, not sensitive to _explicit_ misspecification of the prior model, it can suffer from misspecification: according to Santos' (1996) results, choosing the wrong length-scale for truncated gradient descent leads to similarly inaccurate approximations as passing the false process noise to a Kalman filter. If we extrapolate a bit by replacing \"length-scale\" with \"optimiser\" in the sentences above, we could think of choosing the wrong optimiser as equivalent to selecting the wrong prior model -- this would be model misspecification. The perspective of the wrong optimiser not being unrelated to model-misspecification is corroborated by Table 1: In Table 1, AdaDelta performs *much* worse than other optimisers.\n        \n\nIn general, \nI think the first point is a clear disadvantage, but a disadvantage one has to live with (unless I have missed something, in which case I am open to correcting my assessment).\nThe second point is minor because it mainly affects the phrasing in Section 5.1. It should be relatively straightforward to fix.\n\n\nIn general, I think that the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, so I vote for accepting this submission."

Finally, the authors propose to linearise the mean of the state-transition equation in order to deal with models in which this mean is a non-linear function of the previous state. \n\nThe authors argue that their methodology is more robust than Kalman- or particle-filtering type methods because it does not need to know true the process-noise variance."

The key idea underlying the proposed method is to build on an observation of Santos (1996) that connects regularized least squares solutions to those obtained by running truncated gradient descent. Translated to the state space model inference context, the choice of steps implicitly defines a prior on the transition process, hence truncated optimization can be viewed as doing Bayesian MAP estimation in the state space model. The authors demonstrate their proposed method on two classical examples from the Particle Filter literature and an online inference task utilizing a pretrained network. It is shown that the proposed method is competitive with standard techniques, and works particularly well on the Lorenz-96 model."

The authors however state that there is no sensitivity to missspecification (last paragraph of Page 6). This should be clarified. \n\nHow robust is the method to the number of steps K? What if you run the optimizer essentially until convergence every time, truncating many steps ahead? What if you only do one step of the optimizer. Perhaps the method is not too sensitive to this, but this should be verified and made clear and this aspect of the method should be studied further. \n\nHow would the method compare to some of the more modern KF-based methods mentioned earlier, especially on the neural network problem and with some of the datasets that are used there?\n\nIn practical contexts, we often don't have access to a pretrained model.
