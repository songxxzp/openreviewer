As a result, they report that the performance of the WMT14 test set actually improves. Could you discuss this result, for example?\n\nComments\n1. $\\Omega$ is not defined.\n2.

They run this gradient trick over K-means clusters rather than individual data points to make the problem more tractable.\n\nThe authors evaluate the proposed approach through multiple different qualitative and quantitative metrics: (1) self-consistency - coming from the same distribution, (2) negative-consistency - essentially ignoring outliers in the data distribution, (3) the selected subset should maintain similar values of KL divergence given a quantization of the data (i.e. K-means)."
