                "value": "This paper proposes a method for unsupervised federated graph matching, i.e. matching node pairs that correspond to the same entity across different networks. The authors focus on the unsupervised setting in that it complies better with the privacy requirement. To address the problem of no ground truth matched pairs, the authors compute graphlet degree vectors of each node and use it to match cross network nodes. In addition, to ensure that clients do not know the matching information, the authors design a separate trust region algorithm, such that servers know the matching but does not know embeddings, and for clients vice versa. Some acceleration techniques are used to speedup the computation of Hessians (used in the trust region algorithm) and graphlet degree sampling. \n\nExperiments are done over real-world network pairs, where the proposed method outperforms various FGL baselines. Parameter analysis experiments are also done."

Graph node matching is an important task, and when it is put in federated learning, the authors made a good observation that supervised methods may compromise privacy. The observation is valid, and thus the studied problem, unsupervised federated graph matching, is of good practical value. \n\n2. The design is also reasonable and practical. To ensure that the pseudo-matching information is not disclosed to clients, the authors design a separate trust region algorithm to split optimizations between client and server. Also, some acceleration techniques are proposed with theoretical results (although I did not thoroughly check their correctness). \n\n3. The paper is well organized and states its design rationale in a clear manner. I have no problem following the paper. \n\n4.

                "value": "1. Despite the promising result, I have some questions regarding the fundamental assumption of this paper. The assumption is that, nodes across networks with similar graphlet degree vectors are likely to be the same nodes. However, as graph structures are different in different networks, it may well happen that a node's structure changes a lot, e.g. an author who changes his main research focus. Thus, I would like to know how accurate the assumption is. Maybe the authors can provide some numbers to show. \n\n2. I wonder whether a split-learning technique can achieve the goal of the separate trust region algorithm. From my understanding, the separate trust region algorithm is designed so that the pseudo matchings are kept at servers and not exposed to clients. This may well be achieved with some kind of split learning, where clients maintain their graph feature encoders, and a matching unit is trained at the server with the pseudo labels. In this case, there would be even no requirement of the Hessian matrices. Can the authors justify the necessity of using the separate trust region algorithm and the Hessian? \n\n3. I wonder what the effect is of the number of pseudo labels to the overall algorithm. Intuitively, this seems like a tradeoff, as when you include more pseudo labels, they tend to be less accurate and bring noise to the overall learning. I would like to see a result of such tradeoff.\n\n4. I also wonder what are the effects of the monte-carlo markov chain sampling methods and the quasi-Newton methods on the overall method runtime/efficiency. The authors made no experiments to analyze the effectiveness either design. \n\n5. It seems that the loss function is operated on the 'encrypted' embeddings $\\hat{v}$ instead of $v$. At this time, a normal non-singular matrix $K$ may just twist some dimensions of the vectors, while shrink some other dimensions. Or in other worlds, a normal non-singular matrix $K$ does not preserve distance (which is exactly the loss function). Thus, how does the loss work on encrypted vector embeddings when they are applied a transformation that does not maintain distance is a little beyond me. Do you need orthogonal ones (those that maintain distance)?"
