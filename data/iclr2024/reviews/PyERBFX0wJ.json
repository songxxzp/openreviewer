The first terms in algorithm 1 involve expected $\\log y_T$ and $\\log y_0$ starting from points from the alternate marginal distribution $x_0$ and $x_T$ respectively. My understanding form [3] is that these are the result of simulating the diffusion backwards and hence depend on the parameters of the networks. These log terms do not coincide with the log densities of the target measures unless the IPF procedure has converged, hence these one cannot simply ignore them and use this as a loss without taking gradients through the diffusion simulation. I would argue this is not likelihood training and [3]'s argument is incorrect unless there's the assumption that the method has already converged, in which case there is no need for further iterations?\n\nIt has been shown by the same authors of [3] that this coincides with regular IPF of [2] and does not require this (incorrect) likelihood derivation. \n\nMinor:\n\n- Section 1: Shi et al 2023 does not use IPF but IMF.\n- Vargas et al 2021 does non perform SB on high dimensional examples as claimed, maximum dimension is 4..\n- There are many other constrained domain diffusion methods e.g Fishman et al Diffusion Models for Constrained Domains 2023\n- The authors mention other related work such as Riemannian SGM Bortoli et al 2022, it should be noted that even more relevant to this work is SB and hence OT has been performed on manifolds in Thornton et al Riemannian Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge, 2022\n\n[1] Lou and Ermon Reflected Diffusion Models, 2023 \\\n[2] Bortoli et al Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge 2023 \\\n[3] Chen et al Likelihood Training of Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge using Forward-Backward SDEs Theory, 2022\n[4] Liu et al , Deep Generalized Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge, 2023\n\n**Edit: correcting typos**"

This is in accordance with the recent works of [2,3] who study reflected versions of diffusion models.

            "weaknesses": {

While it is certainly possible (as shown by the authors) to extend the Schrodinger Bridge framework to the reflected setting it is not clear why one would like to do this. I think that a contribution to a top tier venue such as ICLR requires more motivation (either theoretical, methodological or experimental), note that I am not talking about the novelty here (there is no doubt that the presented work is novel). It seems that the authors want to put forward that Schrodinger Bridge has the ability to reduce the length of the integration time in generative modeling (a reason first put forward in the work of [1]) \"Notably, the forward process (1a) requires a long time T to approach the prior distribution, which inevitably leads to a slow inference\". However there already exist many works focused on improving the speed of diffusion models (distillation, better samplers, etc.) which have proven to be more efficient than Schrodinger bridges. \n\n* The authors claim that Proposition 1 is a valid ELBO, however this result is only true at equilibrium. It is no longer true when the vector fields are parametric functions. \n\n* I am not very convinced by the significance of the empirical results. As I emphasized earlier, I appreciate the fact that the authors provide an extensive image investigation, however the results are not very convincing. The quality seems to be worse than [2]. If the authors claim that the reflected SB method improves the speed of the generation then it would have been useful to compare NFE.\n\n* It is not clear at all for me what are the differences between the theoretical section and the work of [3]. The work of [3] is cited but not comparison or discussion is provided. \n\n* The assumption A4 is very strong. It is claimed that it is similar to the one of [4] but this is not true. In fact, the assumption of [4] only holds for one iteration of the IPF. The stability of the approximation across IPF iterations is not clear at all and should be discussed. \n\nMinor comments:\n\n* In the introduction [5] should be cited when citing [6] as the works are concurrent.\n\n* In (3) missing index $t$ in $x_t$ \n\n* When deriving the reflected FBSDE framework I would have appreciated more emphasis on the introduced quantities.\n\n* Could the authors be more precise on the algorithmic differences between the introduced algorithm and the one of [7]?\n\n* It would be very interesting to understand if the current setting can accomodate for an understanding of the dynamic thresholding procedure used in [8]\n\n[1] De Bortoli et al.
