Specifically, the authors proposed the so-called deep restoration prior (DRP), which can be learned by more general image restoration tasks, such as super-resolution and deblurring. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the authors have trained a DRP based on super-resolution with a SwinIR architecture, and applied it to image deblurrring and super-resolution tasks."

However, it is doubtful whether this generalization is necessary since the deep denoising prior can be flexible enough by virtue of advanced neural network architectures.\n\n2. The application of the proposed DRP is more complicated. Specifically, the additional degradation operator H can make the image restoration optimization process more complex, as can be observed in Algorithm 1. Besides, the additional operator H raises another question, that is how to choose this operator. The authors experimented with super-resolution prior, which assumes H to be downscaling, but it is unknown what if other operator is adopted, and which operator is the best.\n\n3. The experimental comparison seems unfair. In specific, the authors used SwinIR for their DRP, while using DRUNet for DPIR, though DRUNet was adopted in the original DPIR work. It is necessary to re-implement DPIR with SwinIR, or re-implement DRP with DRUNet, such that the influences of network structure can be controlled."

                "value": "Although this is a good quality paper, there are a few aspects that could be improved, some important, others less so. \n\nFirst, and most importantly, the paper lacks some discussion/analysis of why restoration networks for problems other than denoising can lead to better results than denoising regularizers. Do they learn better image priors? This is somewhat surprising, in that these other networks are expected to have learned (in addition to a \"prior\") also specific aspects of the particular problem in which they were trained. This begs the question: what problems yield the best restoration networks? Is this choice related to the main problem to be solved?\n\nThe previous comment is related to the following observation: although the authors present the method as working for general restoration networks, they end up only using restoration networks trained for super-resolution. Arguably, SR is a very particular type of inverse problem, in a sense, the one that is closer to pure denoising than any other inverse problem. The authors should comment on this. \n\nIn Section 4, there is some confusion regarding necessary and sufficient conditions. The authors write \"Our analysis will require several assumptions that act as sufficient conditions for our theoretical results.\" This sentence is self-contracting: if the assumptions are *required* they are *necessary* (\"necessary\" and \"required\" are synonyms). In fact, further down, the authors contradict that sentence, by writing \"This mild assumption is necessary ...\".\n\nThe first inequality in Theorem 2 is trivial and doesn't even need to be mentioned. \n\nMinor style issue: it is not good style to write \"...discussion in Kamilov et al. (2023) on ...\" or \"... in Chapter 3 in Beck (2017) ...\". Kamilov and Beck are not papers or books, but people. A nicer way to write these sentences is \"...discussion in the work of Kamilov et al. (2023) on ...\" or \"...discussion in the paper by Kamilov et al. (2023) on ...\" and \"... in Chapter 3 of the book by Beck (2017) ...\".\n\nA probability density function is degenerate, not only if it is supported on a subspace, but on any zero-measure set in the ambient space, for example, a d-manifold, with d < n. \n\nTypo: \"Our method is as a major extension ...\" should be \"Our method is a major extension ...\"."

I would assume for the proposed method, there could be randomness involved in all three main stages: the pre-training, the refinement process, and the Algorithm 1 itself. The same issue could also be true for the considered compared methods. The experimental study should consider multiple runs for each of the mentioned stages and provide individual or combined analysis on the distribution of results rather than just a single run. The reviewers need to be sure whether the provided performance numbers are the worst single runs of compared methods versus the best single run of the proposed method, or are average cases for all considered methods. Without providing such analysis using multiple runs, it is hard to assess the significance of the results for the proposed method.\n\n[1] Liang, J. Cao, G. Sun, K. Zhang, L. Van G., and R. Timofte.
