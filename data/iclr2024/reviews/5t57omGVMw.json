The problem is that the runtime/number of iterations of SOR highly depends on the \"relaxation parameter\" $\\omega$, so the challenge is to learn online good choices of $\\omega$. They look at two settings. First, a deterministic setting where we assume the instances are close enough to the \"asymptotic regime\" where the convergence rate of SOR decreases linearly with respect to the spectral radius of a specific problem-dependent matrix. The second setting we assume the target vector is randomly sampled from what we can think as a truncated Gaussian distribution. In both cases, they show how bandit algorithms can be used to pick parameters $\\omega$ online that work well on average. Furthermore, they show how to use contextual bandits in the case when we have more structured information about the linear systems we need to solve."

The extension to the use of Contextual Bandit algorithms when we are looking at a series of systems with shifted diagonals is interesting, and how we can exploit the stochastic case and skip the use of a surrogate function at all are quite interesting.\n    \n    Even if some of the bounds do not seem to lead to very informative regret guarantees, it seems to be full of interesting technical ideas and does a good job of showing what are the difficulties of controlling the dependency of problem-parameters in these regret bounds.\n    \n- As the authors themselves mention, this is an interesting case where they designed algorithms of two related lines of work (algorithms with predictions and data-driven algorithm design)\n\n- The authors are very careful to not over-sell their contributions: caveats and weaknesses are often immediately mentioned and discussed, together with a summary of these drawbacks at the conclusions sections;\n- The presentation is not perfect, but very good considering how much ground the authors cover in 9 pages. I believe this paper covered a lot of ground, and after skimming a few parts of the appendix it does seem to be very thorough\n- Although it is in the appendix due to space limitations, I really enjoyed reading the related work section since I lack the background in linear system solvers and the related literature;"

Although this is a problem with my lack of background, I believe the authors could add a bit of discussion of what would be \"ideal\" (?) dependencies here;\n- It seems to be that having stochastic target vectors with independent entries is a very strong assumption. The authors acknowledge that assuming the vectors come from a (scaled and somewhat truncated) Gaussian is restrictive, but it was not clear if mild correlation between the entries (positive definite correlation matrix with small off-diagonal entries?) would make the analysis break down;\n- Although the experiments are not the focus of the paper, I do believe they are a bit too simplistic. I do no think the authors should spend time coming up with more experiments, but I think that discussing the limitations of the experiments would be helpful.\n\n\nI am not an expert in algorithms with predictions/data-drive algorithm design (I'm more acquainted with online learning and optimization), so I will take into account the other reviews for my final scores. I might be willing to increase my score, the only reasons why I haven't said yet that this should be highlighted is because ICLR is a broad conference (with a slight focus on deep learning and other large-scale ML techniques), so I am not sure if I would say this should be highlighted, but the contributions are definitely substantive and solid."

The authors mention that these dependencies are not ideal, but I do not have enough context to know what are dependencies that would be more \"acceptable\";\n- On the assumption on $b_t$'s in sec 3, is it really necessary for the entries to be independent of each other? Moreover, how much do you depend on $b_t$'s being exactly the distribution you have? I probably could answer this questions myself if I had the time to go carefully over the proofs, but if the authors could briefly comment on this, it would be great;\n\n### Suggestions\n- The discussion on \"asymptocity\" in sec 2.2 is very unclear. At some point I think I understood more or less what you meant, but this is a very confusing part early on in the paper, and there is not enough context to interpret the plot. Maybe this is more of a note, but if you could expand on this in a revised version of the paper, it would be great.\n- In Theorem 2.1 you cite \"Lemma 2.1.2\" to mean item 2 of Lemma 2.1, which is a bit weird since this is easily misunderstood as a separate lemma (that does not exist);\n- Although I mentioned about one of the plots in Fig 2 before, I think all of the plots in Fig 2 need more context. It is not clear to me what the middle plot is trying to show, and the last plot is great but I only managed to understand that all of the algorithms there were algorithms proposed in the paper by the end of the paper.

                "value": "This a paper about learning a good choice of a parameter of a linear system solver in an online (bandit-like) fashion. The goal is to minimize the number of iterations (and, as a consequence, the running time) of the solver. The paper is theoretical in nature \u2013 the authors prove regret bounds; simple proof-of-principle-style experiments serve only a complementary role.\n\nThe solver of choice for the paper is Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR). It is not the most widely used in practice solver nowadays, but it has some uses, and it has the advantage of being simple and easy to analyse. The authors mention extending their theory to more complex solver as an important direction of future research.\n\nSOR is an iterative solver, and it has a single parameter, denoted by omega. The authors study the following setting: a sequence of linear systems is solved one by one. Before we start solving each system we can pick a value of omega, and after the system is solved we only learn for how many iterations the solver was running.\n\nThe authors propose to use Tsallis-INF bandit algorithm (a variant of more popular Exp3) to learn the parameter omega. The challenge lies in analysis \u2013 the number of iterations as a function of the parameter is non-Lipschitz. Instead, the authors use a continuous surrogate upper bound on the number of iterations, which they claim is reasonably tight. Unfortunately, this means they can only prove that the surrogate cost of their algorithm is close (up to a sublinear regret) to optimal surrogate cost (not the real cost, which might be much smaller) for a fixed parameter chosen in hindsight.\n\nThe second setting studied is in the spirit of contextual bandits. The authors assume all coefficient matrices are the same up to a linear shift of the diagonal. They show that under this assumption it is possible to obtain sublinear regret with respect to best choice of the parameter for each value of the shift separately. Since for a fixed shift there is a fixed optimal parameter, it means that the benchmark is just the optimal unconstrained choice of parameter. This is a very strong result (though only under a strong assumption about input, and still about the surrogate cost).\n\nFinally, the authors also study a setting where target vectors (but not coefficient matrices) are drawn from a distribution, and in this setting they are able to show sublinear regret bounds using the actual (not the surrogate) cost of the algorithm."
