It seems that I cannot undo it now, so I'm instead writing it here.\n\nThis paper proposes a new regularization technique for self-supervised learning. There are many recent works on preserving the internal diversity of self-supervised representation, and one approach is to preserve the effective dimensionality of the representation. Unlike existing work that tries to preserve global dimensionality, this paper argues that local dimensionality might still collapse. To resolve this issue, the paper proposes the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID). Using the Fisher-Rao metric on LID, the proposed method adds a regularization term that makes the distribution of the representation far from the most simplistic distribution (with dimensionality one). Experiments show that the proposed method indeed improves the performance."

I see in section 3 that this quantity is the result of a limit of some other quantity $LID_F$, which then depends on differentiating a function. It would be hard for me to implement this loss function just from reading this paper. How are all of these values calculated?\n\n(2) Follow up from (1): It is unclear how you estimate a \"local\" dimensionality from a mini-batch of samples. The mini-batch is sampled over the entire dataset, so none of them lie in the local neighborhood of other samples within the batch. I don't think this is addressed.\n\n(3) How does the proposed LIDs regularizer compare to regularizing global dimensionality by decorrelating features. The authors site a few works at the end of the first paragraph of the intro, but do not compare against them. For instance [Barlow twins] and [VICE-Reg] are popular ways of doing this. \n\n(4) Follow up from (3): Regularizing global dimensionality makes sense to me, but regularizing local dimensionality does not. e.g. looking at Figure 1(c), the authors show a few examples of local dimensionality collapse compared with one example of high local dimensionality. To me, it looks like the examples with low local dimensionality (i.e. low LID, but constant GID) exhibit more structure and therefore could be better features. How do you expect to learn good features when you regularize the distribution to be a random gaussian both globally and locally?\n\n(5) I don't see any results showing a correlation between test accuracy and LID. I would expect to see a plot showing that when LID increases, so does accuracy. Perhaps I missed it, if so please point me there. Furthermore, I would expect GID and LID to be correlated; so I would expect some result that shows improving LID with constant GID improves accuracy. Perhaps the LID and GID scores could be added to Table 1?"
