In the introduction, the paper claims \"The overlook may lead to potential threats in the feature space of AT models, which harms robust classification\", but does not illustrate what threat exactly. Since this is the motivation of the paper it would be better to provide some examples or citations.\n2. The motivation of having asymetric negative contrast is not clear. For the example in Figure 2, given the randomness in negative pair selection, the clean car should be away from both dog and cat feature distributions, rather than just away from dog and close to cat. Performing asymetric negative contrast also does not lead to much difference in the ablation comparing to symetric loss\n3. The formulation of the reverse attention is not clear. In Equ. (5), $z_i$ and $\\omega^i$ appears to be scaler values, so the Hadamard product isn't needed. Also it is unclear how exactly is the reverse attention strengthen the confidence of the model. It will be better to formulate the entire forward pass from z to p' will help, or directly visualize the comparison of p and p'\n4. From the ablation study, significant performance improvement is brought by reverse attention. However, it is uncertain if the improved robustness is brought by gradient masking, where the existance of reverse attention smoehow blocks the gradient propagation for whitebox attack generation. Providing results on blackbox transfer attacks from other models is needed.\n\nMinor point: The use of abbreviation (OE, NP, PP etc.) is very nonstandard and make the paper hard to follow. If the abbreviations have to be used then having a table summarizing these abbreviations will be helpful."

The authors find previous AT method suffer from poor representation, and highlight two characteristics of robust features: Exclusion and Alignment. These two attributes ensure each natural and adversarial example sets close in the corresponding class, and maintains a large margin with other classes. With the guidance of two characteristics, this work proposes two techniques. First, an asymmetric negative contrast based on probabilities (ANC) is proposed to meet Exclusion. It increases the gap between the natural examples and negative examples from other classes. Second, reverse attention (RA) is proposed to boost Alignment, which aligns the features of natural and adversarial examples by weighting. The framework can be used in a plug-and-play manner with existing AT methods. Empirical evaluations on various datasets and models have proved the validity of the method."

(2018)\n[3] Learning Diverse and Discriminative Representations via the Principle of Maximal Coding Rate Reduction. (2020)\n\n2. Figure 1 only shows the distance between natural example and AE/OE, lacking the distances among same-class natural examples. Why not try t-SNE visualization to show the distributions of these three class points?\n\n3. How to avoid robust feature collapse (i.e. all features converge to 0)? In this case, the features of natural examples and AEs are well-aligned.\n\n4.  The methods listed in this paper for comparison, AT, TRADES, MART, AWP, etc., are too low in accuracy and robustness. (SAT, S2O, UDR are too weak and shouldn't be used as baselines at all, I suggest to just remove them.)  For example, taking ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 against PGD-40, they should have a robustness higher than 51% (44% in this paper) and an accuracy higher than 84% (76% of AWP in this paper). Getting an increase from a reasonable baseline is more convincing for the validity of the proposed method.\n\n5. In Section 3.3, what does it mean for the n blocks in the last layer. The last layer is the FC layer. The number of blocks means the number of reverse attention blocks or n iterations of reverse attention block? It is also confusing about the auxiliary probability vector p used in the training and testing stages.\n\n6. During the training, original output of the true label j before softmax is \\Omega_j which contains z_i w^{(i,j)}. After reverse attention, the latter term becomes z_i (w^{(i,j)})^2? How exactly does this help with robustness from a math perspective? Correct me if I have some misunderstanding regarding Fig. 3. \n\n7. Can you explain more about the auxiliary probability vector p. It makes me confused about the white-box and adaptive attacks. For the so-called \u201cwhite-box\u201d attack in this paper, the robust accuracy against PGD-40 (89%) is even higher than the natural accuracy (85%), which is quite non-trivial and hard to understand. Can you explain?\n\n8. For TRADES-ANCRA, WideResNet performs worse than ResNet18, which is inconsistent with the conclusions of almost all previous experiments. Is it possible that the auxiliary probability vector p brings some kind of a priori information that only applies to ResNet18?"
