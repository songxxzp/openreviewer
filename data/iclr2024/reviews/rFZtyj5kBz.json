In the case the number of malicious agents is not known, they show a way to estimate such number via some approximation (approximating the multinomial with multivariate normal). \n\nFinally, they evaluate their algorithm on a few different datasets (Section 5)."

However, as discussed even in the intro of the paper, there can be many settings where there is quite a bit of heterogeneity among the agents not due to their Byzantine and malicious behaviors but the underlying distributions are just inherently different. In fact, this heterogeneity seemed to me the motivation to studying this problem \u2014 i.e. the bolded sentences in the second paragraph of the intro. But the paper seems to study cases when there isn\u2019t much heterogeneity?"

However, the assumption that the v^(k) values (the histogram values) aren\u2019t too different across agents in the non-iid setting essentially gives you an iid setting, right? I\u2019m a little confused on the difference so it would be helpful to compare exactly the iid setting and the non-iid setting (along with other assumptions made for each setting) and how exactly they are really different.\n\n\n-In proving the main result (Theorem 1), the appearance of the inverse of the CDF of the standard normal distribution seems surprising as there was no normality assumption before; it would be good to cite a reference for what is referred to as \u201cthe binomial proportion confidence interval\u201d or eqn (13) in the proof of Theorem 1. Also, can\u2019t one just apply the DKW inequality (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvoretzky%E2%80%93Kiefer%E2%80%93Wolfowitz_inequality) here? It should be sufficient to show concentration of the empirical CDF (which exactly characterizes the empirical histogram values v(k)_h) toward the true CDF (which also characterizes the true bar(v) values). This would avoid the need to union bound over H values too as DKW tells you that over all possible h values (i.e. hth cut point), the empirical and the true CDF value is close with high probability. \n\n\n -How\u2019s the final (1-alpha)-quantile being calculated after identifying the benign clients? Is it simply combining all the clients non-conformal scores altogether and then calculating the (1-alpha)-quantile? If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m not understanding the federated nature of this problem except for the fact that some of the clients data are being ignored due to their apparent distributional difference to other clients?  How can one tell if this distributional difference of some clients is due to their malicious behavior or truly inherent distributional difference?"
