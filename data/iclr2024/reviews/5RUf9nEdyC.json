This work appears to be a fusion of two research lines:\n- From the perspective of graph sparsification, there have already been efforts to prune edges based on edge properties and graph connectivity. The assertions made in \\cite{wang2022pruning} closely align with this study, suggesting that the removal of \"non-bridge\" edges (corresponding to the \"low-degree edges\") has minimal impact on graph information flow. Furthermore, it provides theoretical support and error bound analysis.\n- From the perspective of weight sparsification, [1, 2] have extensively explored the feasibility of using PGD for parameter pruning. I cannot see the substantial differences or new contributions in this paper.\n\nW3. While the innovations are intuitively appealing, they still lack theoretical substantiation. The assertion that high-degree edges should be pruned is not a trivial conclusion. I find the similar claim in [3], which examines graph connectivity, to be more appealing. \n\n[1] Zhou X, Zhang W, Xu H, et al.

While the proposed idea of sparsifying the graph edges based on the degree information is simple and makes intuitive sense (as also shown empirically), why do the authors consider only the degree information as opposed to other metrics like spectral information of the graph or centrality which might convey more information about the graph. Is the degree information sufficient in this regard to obtain a sufficiently sparse graph in comparison with these other metrics? Recent work has shown randomly dropping graph edges can also help training, in comparison to the proposed idea in Yu et al.  [1], how does randomly pruning graph edges compare?\n\n2. The parameters sparsification method used is PGD with $l_0$ regularization. But there is no justification provided for using this particular method. There are other continuous sparsification schemes that have shown to achieve highly sparse networks in a single training run for feedforward networks like Kusupati et al. [2] and Louizos et al. [3].\n\n3. The authors use GATs and GCNs in their experiments. However, the structure of GATs allows them to inherit some degree information in the form of attention while GCNs do not. Does this difference change the performance of the proposed graph pruning criterion for either architectures?\n\n4. The results in Table 1 might be better visualized via a heatmap showing how much Graph sparsity and Weight sparsity can be achieved and if there is a tradeoff between the two.\n\n\n[1] Rong, Yu, et al. \"Dropedge: Towards deep graph convolutional networks on node classification.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.10903* (2019).\n\n[2] Kusupati, Aditya, et al. \"Soft threshold weight reparameterization for learnable sparsity.\" *International Conference on Machine Learning* 2020.\n\n[3] Louizos, Christos, Max Welling, and Diederik P.

                "value": "This paper introduces several techniques to sparsify graph data and networks in order to build a sparse graph learning model. The important aspects are as follows:\n1) Degree-based graph sparsification to remove low-degree edges and make graphs sparse;\n2) Distillation by matching the classification logits of the model pre-trained on the whole graphs;\n3) Parameter sparsification by using a subset of parameters (i.e., Projected Gradient Descent).\n\nWhen applied to classical GNNs such as GCN/GAT/GIN, the experimental results validate the proposed method by showing some performance improvements."

                "value": "1. Baseline GNN models are somewhat outdated. Traditional GNNs such as GCN/GAT/GIN are known to suffer from limited expressivity, resulting in restricted empirical performances in many cases. Several studies have done expressiveness analysis, to name a few references [3,4]. Later works, such as graph transformers and expressive GNNs [1,2,3], have proven to be more powerful and meaningful for empirical studies.\n\n2. Detailed ablation experiments are lacking, which are necessary to clearly validate the effectiveness of each component.\n\n3. The theoretical analysis concerning the motivation behind preserving low-degree edges seems somewhat disconnected from the main idea.\n\n4. Some claims regarding training efficiency and generalization performance appear to be misleading.\n\nThese points are detailed in the questions section below.\n\n\n\n[1] Recipe for a general, powerful, scalable graph transformer.

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Conventional GNNs are empirically seen to suffer from limited expressivity. How do the latest transformer-based GNNs or more expressive models like GPS[1], Specformer[2], and PPGN[3] compare when applying the proposed techniques? These newer models have already surpassed the empirical performance of older baselines like GCN/GAT/GIN. Validating the proposed techniques on these latest methods rather than older models would make the arguments more convincing.\n\n2. About Figure 1: What is the precise step for removing high-degree or low-degree edges? Given a graph sparsity value, how exactly is the subgraph generated? Is random sampling involved in this process? If so, could you provide the results of multiple runs (e.g., mean and standard deviation) to separate the training-related noise?\n\n3. Ablation Studies: Could you provide detailed ablation studies on the effectiveness of the proposed three components? a) graph sparsification by removing edges; b) model distillation; c) parameter sparsification with projected gradient descent. It seems that these components could be applied separately to any of the baseline training methods (UGS/WD-GLT) in empirical studies.\nIn Figure 13, there are some comparisons made. Graph sparsification doesn\u2019t seem to improve empirical performance at all. There are no curves representing UGS/WD-GLT without distillation loss. Although considering multi-hop subgraphs appears to be effective in a way, this concept is not new in graph learning literature (e.g., k-WL GNNs [4]).\n\n4. The theoretical analysis involving the upper bound of the symmetrically normalized adjacency matrix is somewhat unclear.\na) Concerning the mentioned analysis, how realistic is the assumption of the Lipschitz constant being present?\nb) If the aforementioned assumptions hold true for the specified models, how plausible is it that removing low-degree edges actually increases the term $\\\\frac{\\\\text{deg}\\_\\text{max} + 1}{\\\\text{deg}\\_\\text{min} + 1}$? This aspect may be specific to datasets and could possibly be numerically simulated.\nc) Conversely, removing high-degree edges appears to reduce the generalization gap by lowering $\\\\text{deg}\\_\\text{max}$, according to the preceding analysis. What is the reason this aspect is not emphasized or motivated more within the discussion?\n\n4. In Eq. (5), the edge score is always symmetric. How does this approach apply to directed graphs?\n\n5. How crucial is the distillation training? It appears to undermine the purpose of utilizing sparse graphs, as there is a necessity to initially train the model on the full graphs. This approach also seems to contradict the claim of \"a single training,\" a statement that is reiterated numerous times throughout the paper.\n\n6. The paper asserts that \"TEDDY significantly surpasses conventional iterative approaches in generalization.\" Could you provide more details to substantiate this claim? Which sections or aspects of the experiments corroborate this assertion regarding generalization?\n\n7. The paper claims that the employed PGD training saves computation time compared to the iterative approach. Could you provide additional results to validate this claim, such as comparing training hours using the same GPU hardware?\n\n[1] Recipe for a general, powerful, scalable graph transformer.
