                "value": "This paper provides a PAC-Bayes analysis of prompt engineering and a simple prompt search routine. The paper starts by proposing a simple greedy prompt search strategy that incrementally adds tokens that maximise the reward sequentially with a regularisation in terms of the probability of the next token as predicted by a language model. The authors then remark provide a PAC-Bayes bound for prompts by formulating the prompt search space as a hypothesis, the LM predicted token probabilities as priors and the posterior as a point mass. The authors show that the resulting bounds are surprisingly tight, and explain the observation that prompt engineering does not seem to overfit massively even though it is optimized on the training set only."

The use of PAC-Bayes theory in this context is intuitive and insightful and, to my knowledge, novel, and I'd even be a bit surprised that no one has tried this so far.\n\n- The derivation of bound, which is the paper's main contribution, is easy to follow and seems sound. The resulting bound is a massive improvement over the literature (although I am not extremely familiar with the literature in this area -- I defer a more thorough assessment to another, more experienced reviewer), and the experimental validation also provides empirical evidence supporting the authors' argument."

The critical weakness is that, as the authors acknowledged in the latest manuscript, the validity of almost all derivations hinges on the assumption that there is no data contamination and that the encoder was not trained on the data that it is asked to infer (i.e., the setting is truly zero-shot). As the authors acknowledged, this is something that cannot be fully proved and disproved, partially due to the fact that what was included in the training data is not fully transparent and publicly known.\n\nHowever, as important as this weakness is, I think the dilemma is at least not only attributable to this work, and given the relative dearth of theoretical works on this area, I still think there is value in this paper to the community. I'd encourage the authors to emphasize more clearly and explicitly the limitations of their work and analysis throughout the paper. A possible remedy is to pre-train and fine-tune a comparable open-source model from scratch where one can fully control what data the model is trained on to investigate the derived bounds; I acknowledge this may require an enormous amount of compute and some qualitative discussions would suffice."

Since prompts are a hypothesis space with a strong prior, this model family seems like a very promising candidate for obtaining strong generalization bounds even in the few-shot-learning regime, which has been largely out of reach.

But it's hard to tell because the points in the plot are not paired. Are there examples where using the PAC-Bayes bound leads to a different and better model selection choice than just using the training error? \n\n- _extends to the methods proposed in Wen et al. (2023)._ That paper has a much more sophisticated search method than the greedy search here. How do we know the resulting prompts are competitive with other search methods? It's less interesting if we're getting generalization bounds for a suboptimal classifier.\n\n- >both training and test accuracy drop monotonically in tandem as we flip these training labels (Figure 6), which suggests that the prompts cannot overfit the random labels.\n\n    - Either that, or the greedy search procedure just can't find a good enough prompt. As far as I can tell, we can't decide based on the evidence in the paper.\n\n- As far as I can tell, the analysis doesn't actually suggest a useful practical algorithm. Based on Figures 3 and 4, if I want to find the best prompt, it seems like my best bet is still to just pick the one that minimizes the training error (using whatever search method I come up with) and not bother with SRM."

Can you suggest a good prompt?\" it replies: \"This image contains a {cat/dog}.\" So intuitively it seems like using the likelihood of possible CLIP prompts under this LM prompt would give a much better prior than off-the-shelf LLaMA, and it might also help with fluency. In general, it would've been interesting to see more ablation on the prompt used for the prior."
