The paper produced an interesting decomposition of the difference between the strategic and non-strategic decision makers into three factors, i.e., benefit from the successful improvement, loss from the failed improvement, and loss from manipulation. Based on this decomposition, the paper proposed a novel decision-maker's utility function as in section 3.1, which captures the different preferences over the aforementioned three factors by different linear weights. The paper shows that these weights can be used as disincentives for manipulation, and promote algorithmic fairness. In addition, the paper produced some explanatory experiments on FICO dataset as well as synthetic Gaussian data."

A decision maker decides whether to accept or reject based on a threshold policy $\\\\pi(x)=1(x \\\\ge \\\\theta)$. Unqualified individuals ($y=0$) respond to $\\\\pi$ by choosing whether to \u201cmanipulate\u201d ($M=1$) or by \u201cimprove\u201d ($M=0$) their feature to get a better outcome, and qualified individuals do not respond.\n* Manipulation is defined as resampling $x$ from the distribution of qualified users $P(x|y=1)$ with probability $1-\\\\epsilon$, and rejection by the decision maker otherwise. Improvement is defined as sampling from $P(x|y=1)$ with probability $q$, and sampling from $P^I(x)$ otherwise. The random costs associated with manipulation and improvement are $C_M$ and $C_I$, respectively. Each unqualified individual selects $M$ rationally, based on the expected outcome.\n* In the theoretical analysis, Theorem 2.3 characterizes the functional form of manipulation probability $P_M(\\\\theta)$, and Theorem 4.1 provides a provable discrepancy between strategic and non-strategic decision makers. Section 3 decomposes the difference between strategic and non-strategic decision maker utilities into three interpretable components, and propositions 4.2-4.4 demonstrate the effect of changing weights of each component. Finally, Theorem 4.5 identifies conditions under which manipulation can be disincentivized using reweighing of the three components, and Theorem 4.6 identifies conditions under which the decision maker can disincentivize manipulation and promote fairness simultaneously using the same method.\n* In the empirical analysis, theoretical findings are validated using parametric distributions (beta distribution fit on FICO data, and synthetic Gaussian data), and the effect of reweighing is explored. Reweighing is shown to significantly decrease the probability of manipulation at the price of a small decrease in accuracy."

                "value": "This paper studies a novel strategic classification setting, which combines both manipulations and improvements on the agents' part, as well as a strategic decision maker who is free to adjust some regularization parameters to control for either type of behavior. Unlike in many existing setups, here each individual in the dataset can either manipulate the features without improving its qualification, or elect to improve the qualification --- both at distinct costs. Moreover, once again distinct from most standard settings, choosing to manipulate or improve does not lead to a deterministic change in e.g. outcome once the corresponding cost is paid; instead, there is randomness in the system, such that an improver will with some probability $q$ fail to improve the qualification, and similarly a manipulator will with some probability $\\epsilon$ be detected and banned from participation. \n\nIt is shown in this setting that: (1) depending on whether $q + \\epsilon \\geq 1$ or not, the probability of any population member being manipulative is either monotonically increasing in the decision threshold $\\theta$, or first increases and then decreases. (2) The strategic decision maker's utility function at each threshold $\\theta$ is a sum of three terms: one that reflects benefit from improvement; the second one that reflects loss from failed improvement; and the third one that reflects loss coming from manipulation. (3) By letting the decision maker toggle these three terms by multiplying them by factors $k_1, k_2, k_3$, they define and study what is essentially a \"regularized\" decision maker, who by toggling one of $k_1, k_2, k_3$ can, up to certain assumption, (a) lower or increase decision threshold $\\theta$; and (b) disincentivizing manipulation.\n\nThere is also an application to fairness, whereby the decision maker can mitigate unfairness (demographic parity, equal opportunity and some more general definition) in a two disjoint groups setting while at the same time disincentivizing manipulative behavior. Finally, two experiments are conducted, one on FICO data and another one on synthetic data, showing that the theoretical conclusions proved in the paper are true in practice as well."

I am having a hard time parsing the intended setting of p_I --- the distribution that unsuccessful improvers fall into. For instance, in one of the experiments, it is set to a distribution with averaged successful/unsuccessful parameters. However, it is not a priori clear what this distribution should represent in various non-synthetic potential applications, and if this modeling aspect is even justified that often.\n\n2. The statements of the main results are obtained essentially by taking derivatives and evaluating their signs; I would like to see a more concrete discussion, in the main part, of the actual rates at which the various quantities of interest improve/decay. This might help at least partially address the following practical question:\n\n3. What are the normative takeaways? The framework is interpreted by the authors, among other things, as a way to add regularization from the decision maker's perspective to be able to achieve desired effects on improvement and manipulation probabilities, group fairness, etc. However, with an abundance of ways to set k1, k2, k3 to get different effects, it is not clear what course of action the decision maker should take in a given setting. As in the above question, examining the sensitivity of the resulting downstream effects to the choice of the k's appears to be one way to begin to understand this; but also I would like to see some high-level discussion on this for potential applications."
