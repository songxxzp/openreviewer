Numerical experiments lack competing baselines. The numbers in Table 1 and 2 thus do not carry a lot of meanings. The rationale behind incorporating demand prediction inputs in the inventory prediction is not clearly stated. The numerical results only compare the performance when the hyperparameter is chosen from {0,0.5,1}.\n3. What is a lane? Is it an edge on the graph? This notion is quite untraditional both in the supply chain literature and the graph learning literature.\n4. There are no innovations in terms of neural network architectures.\n5. The design of the solution seems ad-hoc. It is unclear how the solution package proposed in this paper can be generalized to solve other practical problems. The paper also lacks some theoretical contributions to justify the soundness of the approach.\n\n\nAs I am also a researcher working on the intersection of machine learning and supply chain management, I do not see that this paper fits with the audience of this conference. Simply using a GAN to solve a specific dataset does not excite the audience of this community."

To my understanding, the difficulty of this paper only lies in the construction of the target variables (partly due to the dynamism of the system). Section 3.2 and 3.3 are simply preparing these target values, so I think the authors should make this information simpler. So far, Section 3.2 and 3.3 look more like a \"project report\" to the industry partner. For the audience of this conference, why should we care about these calculations leading to equation (12) and (18)? In the end, neural networks are just functional approximations: we match input with output. Thus, even though the output can be difficult to compute, preparing the target variables is just data-processing. Unfortunately, it may not be exciting for the audience of the ICLR conference to learn about how the authors process the data."

                "value": "My major concerns are with the presentation and clarity. It is almost impossible to follow the details and check the correctness of the methods introduced. The authors directly dive into the methodology without clearly state the problem, and combined the modeling with discussions of GAT. It is rarely possible to immediately distinguish which parameters are known before making the prediction, which are decision variables. What are inputs of your prediction? What is the definition of planned shipments? Do you know a plan of future supply before making prediction? Not mentioning that the overwhelming number of parameters and notations used without sufficient explanations make it even tougher.  It is a must to explicitly setup the problem and introduce all assumptions and formulation details of your supply chain model, especially when it seems that your formulation and model of the supply chain is different from traditional literature.\n\nOther minor presentation problems include:\n- It is uncommon in the network literature using the term \"lane\"; commonly used are edges or arcs. The author used \"edges\" when describing the graph but used \"lane\" elsewhere. It is misleading.\n- Overuse of footnotes is annoying. If the texts are important, bring them to the main text; if not, delete it or put in the supplementals.\n- The notations are bad and unreadable. For example, 7 super/sub-scripts for a single variable\n$$\\hat{q}^{day, t, Iter=n}_{u, v, est at w, recv}$$\n\n*Contributions*\n\nI may misunderstand some parts (for reasons stated above) but I personally don't think this paper makes sufficient realistic contribution to the real supply chain planning problems. From a macroscopic view, the prediction problem makes plausible sense and the ability to predict the incoming of supply is good. In reality, the supply chains are rather decentralized and divided without a centralized decision maker that overlook everything and make the planning.  Local decision makers meet much smaller-scale problems and have more well-controlled supplier relationships that leads to accuracte local prediction of incoming supply. Collecting data and make centralized prediction can be infeasible and unnecessary.\n\nThe authors claim contributions on the design of loss function, which is bi-objective controlled by a weight hyperparameter. In optimization society, it is usually wise to avoid such formulation because it is hard to interpret and justify the results, especially when your two objectives are in different scale (one daily error, and the other weekly cumulated errors). How can you quantify the impacts of the two objectives to the followup planning? Which error will result in higher operational costs?"

                "value": "- The baseline methods are obviously not good enough and compare your method with them does not stand you out. Are they the only options people can use to predict the ongoing supply?\n\n- Is the method introduced robust to disruptions? It is one of the most important questions to think about when claiming the usefulness. If there is SKU shutting down or suddenly high labor shortage (as in the pandemic), I doubt if the method can quickly capture the dynamics and still have good performance."

The authors do a good job at motivating (in text) the reasoning behind their choices, however, there is little to no evidence to support the specific choices. Can the authors provide ablations in support of the individual choices in the architecture? For example: \n- Discrete time-deltas vs continuous representation\n- Delta vs Non-delta\n- Quantity multiplier vs absolute number\n- etc.\n\nMoreover, in the same direction, the set of baselines is extremely limited.
