An efficient diffusion sampling strategy is proposed that, if the tangent space at a denoised sample forms a Krylov subspace, allows the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method to maintain data consistency updates within this subspace. This eliminates the need for the computationally expensive manifold-constrained gradient (MCG) reducing computation time. The approach achieves  SOTA reconstruction quality in large scale inverse imaging problems, such as multi-coil MRI and 3D CT reconstruction."

However, I believe it lacks a comparison with the classical Compressed Sensing (CS) approach, which relies on sparse image representations and has shown success, especially in MRI applications (as in the classical reference [*]). It's unclear whether SOTA diffusion models can compete with traditional CS algorithms. Perhaps referencing recent studies that compare diffusion models with classical CS methods would offer a more comprehensive perspective on the field's current status.\n\n\u2022\tIt is not clear why the Krylov method, originally developed for square matrix A can be successfully applied to the image reconstruction problem when A has fewer rows than columns. See my question number 1 below.\n\n\u2022\tThe proposed method has a limitation since it only considers linear forward models with the form y=Ax (see my question number 2 below).\n\n\u2022\tThe methods requires that the tangent space on the clean manifold at a denoised sample forms a Krylov subspace and experimental results suggests that such assumption is met. However, an intuition about why the tangent space forms a Krylov subspace is missing. It would be useful to have identified conditions for such assumption become true (see my question number 3 below).\n\n\u2022\tExperiments: Quality results are expressed in terms of PSNR and SSIM values, but it is not clear if these are averaged values and the number of instances considered in the corresponding average. The experiments should also report variability of the results, for example showing standard deviation for a more comprehensive comparison of different methods (See my question number 4).\n\nMinor comments:\n\n-\tFig. 2 caption should indicate what are the numbers at the bottom of each subimage, which I think they are PSNR/SSIM\n\n-\tAcronym NFE is not defined in the paper, please introduce its definition (Number of Forward Evaluations?)\n\n-\tJust before eq.

                "value": "1.\tIn section 2, it is stated that in the forward model (1): y=Ax, we can assume A square without losing generality because, if not, we can consider the modified equation (2): A*y=A*Ax, because its solution is also a solution of problem (1). However, equation (1) has infinite number of solutions when A has fewer rows than columns as in the considered in the image reconstruction scenarios, and the solution of eq. (2) is unique if A is full rank matrix. It is not clear why the unique solution of eq. (2) is the most preferable solution over all possible solutions of eq. (1). Could you please clarify about this?\n\n2.\tThe proposed method has a limitation since it only considers linear forward models with the form y=Ax and uses Krylov method to minimize l(x) = ||y - Ax||^2. However, just after eq. (6) it is mentioned that Krylov method can be extended to non-linear problems and the example l(x) = 0.5||y - Ax||^2 is given, which is confusing since it is the same optimization problem as in the linear model y=Ax. Can you clarify what do you mean by extending Krylov method to nonlinear problems? Can thus you apply your method to an inverse problem having a nonlinear forward model?\n\n3.\tThe methods requires that the tangent space on the clean manifold at a denoised sample forms a Krylov subspace and experimental results suggests that such assumption is met. What is the intuition behind this assumption? Can you provide some conditions for such assumption become true?\n\n4.\tRegarding the reported PSNR and SSIM values: Are these average values? If so, how many samples have you consider computing the average? Can you also report the variability of these measures to derive conclusions about the comparison of methods? Are the differences between methods statistically significative in some sense?"
