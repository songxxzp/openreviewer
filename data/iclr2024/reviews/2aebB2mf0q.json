The author introduces a novel thermodynamics-inspired, non-uniform data augmentation technique aimed at emulating the chromaticity and positional alterations in infrared imagery caused by spatial distortions. This plug-and-play augmentation significantly amplifies the diversity of training samples, thereby enhancing the network's robustness. Additionally, the author presents an adaptive exponential loss function to effectively manage the pronounced class imbalance between targets and backgrounds. The experimental results substantiate the efficiency of the proposed method."

The proposed plug-and-play non-uniform data augmentation method is well sounded and rounded, exhibits a high degree of robustness and adaptability. Its applicability extends across various infrared tasks, thereby making a valuable contribution to the advancement of infrared research."

In addition to employing the translation of five key points for data generation, the author has harnessed specific techniques and threshold settings to ensure that the chromaticity enhancement results align with the intended expectations. These techniques warrant an in-depth elucidation.\n2. In Section 3.4, the author conducts an analysis of the proposed Non-uniform Chromaticity Enhancement (NUC) and Non-uniform Position Enhancement (NUP), categorizing NUC as robust enhancement and NUP as mild enhancement. Is this distinction related to the concepts of strong and weak augmentation in semi-supervised learning? Furthermore, it is advisable to provide the theoretical basis for the demarcation of strong and weak augmentation to substantiate the rationale for this division.\n3. The author introduces the AEWLoss as a means to address class imbalance issues; however, the paper only expounds on its treatment of positive samples. To enhance readability and the comprehensiveness of the article, please supplement the elucidation of the treatment for negative samples along with the corresponding formulas.\n4. Table 2 clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the non-uniform data augmentation method proposed in this paper. However, the author has not expounded on the foundational data augmentation methods used for comparison. It would be beneficial to include a brief description of the baseline data augmentation methods.\n5. Is there any inconsistency in the magnification scale in the visual comparison figures? A meticulous examination is recommended to provide more accurate and intuitive visual contrast."

None of the methods presented seems to be beneficial for general vision/machine learning methods and therefore would not draw enough attention from the participants.\n\n2. Technical novelty/soundness: \n\n2a. Data augmentation: the core idea seems to be adding a random value drawn from a sine curve to the pixel value. I could not connect how this strategy is deduced from thermodynamic modeling (of temperature field). In addition, were there any experiments performed to check if random numbers from a normal distribution would lead to an inferior augmentation? Why the sine function is essential here? \nIt looks like non-uniform chromaticity augmentation is described within Section 3.2 for non-uniform position augmentation. From Table 2, it looks like they are different. If so, they should be described clearly highlighting the distinction between them.\n\n2b. Adaptive loss  function: Section 3.3 text claims the loss function is designed to handle the positive-negative imbalance. Idont understand how loss function in Eqn 3 is addressing this imbalance. The probability p_i seems to be agnostic to label of the pixel.\nDoes the x in Eqn 2 denote location? If so, I dont understand why pixel location should be part of a loss function.\n\n2c. Semi-supervised learning: There seems to be a rather complex loss function proposed in Eqn 7 to incorporate the unlabeled examples. The text does not explain the rational/theory/intuition as to why this loss function is appropriate for this problem (or any semi-supervised learning in general). Unless we understand what the loss function is doing, it is difficult to judge its merit.\n\n3. Evaluation: The measures for evaluation needs to be explained and supported by referring to past studies that also used it. Since the measures are not the conventional ones, this is essential for the paper to clarify. Just an example, readers from natural image object detection will be confused why IoU is used for accuracy -- it is typically used to match the predictions with GT to compute mAP."
