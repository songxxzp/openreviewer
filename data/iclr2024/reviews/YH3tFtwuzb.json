                "value": "This work studies a differentially private version of bitfit, termed DP-Bitfit. DP-bitfit, like bitfit, works by tuning only the bias terms in the model. However, the key innovation here is recognizing that bitfit is highly parameter efficient which is crucial for DP learning. Second, is recognizing that the gradients are much computationally cheaper to calculate due to it being activation-free. Overall, this work shows impressive empirical results evaluated on both image and text models."

                "value": "Overall, this work shows to be a strong submission. This work includes comprehensive comparison between different existing methods (e.g., ghost clipping) and shows impressive benefits in both memory, throughput, and final model utility. It is perhaps unsurprising that this performs so well given the performance of non-DP bitfit, however, the core benefit of this work is recognizing its potential for the DP setting.\n\nThe organization of the work is clear, and the work includes several key figures and diagrams that help the reader follow the work. For example, Figure 1 clearly shows the empirical benefits of the approach and Section 3/ Figure 2 the  asymptotic benefits.\n\nThough the novelty is lower because this is essentially applying DP-SGD to the existing \"bitfit\" algorithm, this work include smany empirical results evaluated across different model families (e.g., ViT models,resnets, and roberta models) on both text and image classification as well as text generation."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "This works lacks a clear empirical exploration of the difference between the activation and the model memory. Right now, it is clear that the algorithm uses much less memory and compute. However, it is unclear how the total memory in figure 1 is split between storing the model, materializing activations, etc. \n\nFigure 4 is extremely confusing. How can DP-BITFIT be both on the x-axis and in the legend? What does maximum through of algorithm mean?"
