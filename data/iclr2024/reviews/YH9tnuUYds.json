DLPA initially learns an environment model that accommodates both discrete and continuous actions. It optimizes this model using prediction errors over a continuous H-step horizon when the state input includes only the true state at the first step. Subsequently, DLPA employs the CEM method extended to the PAMDP setting, based on this model, to perform MPC."

The author's description of the key innovations in this paper, such as the calculation of the H-step loss in model learning or the introduction of the CEM method, does not place enough emphasis on what makes these approaches unique when applied to the specific problem scenario PAMDP. For instance, what sets apart the H-step loss in DLPA compared to the traditional model-based approaches, or how does this paper's use of CEM bring innovation in the context of PAMDP, especially regarding handling the relationship between discrete and continuous actions? These are the questions that are more central to the paper and that I would like to have a better understanding of.\n3. During the experimental process, the number of training steps for DLPA differs from the other baseline methods. This discrepancy makes it challenging to adequately assess the stability of DLPA's training, including whether it exhibits oscillations or other issues. Additionally, it appears that HyAR may not achieve full convergence in certain environments. Therefore, it would be advisable to provide additional experimental results with a consistent number of training steps for all algorithms to ensure a fair comparison.\n4. For the experiments assessing the impact of CEM-based MPC on DLPA, it would be beneficial to include ablation studies with other traditional model-based non-MPC methods, such as MBPO, applied in the context of PAMDP."

Here, my issue is with random shooting. I suggest using a more descriptive and potentially conventional dichotomy which splits the class based on how the model is used in planning, such as Dyna-based methods and decision-time planning methods. One uses planning for credit assignment and the other for policy evaluation.\n * Section 4: Section 4.1 and Figure 1 point to notation that isn't defined until Section 4.2. Consider introducing notation earlier.\n * Figure 1: The illustrations are nicely done here. However, the caption could use more supporting text so readers understand the semantics of the green dots and the trajectories inside the states.\n * Section 4.1: Why do you call $s_t$ an observation when it was previously defined as a state in Section 2 (assuming it comes from $S$ )? If you want to distinguish it from outputs of the dynamics model, then you can always use \"environment state\" and \"model state.\"\n * Section 4.1: Should $r_{t+1}$ have a hat, since it is an estimated quantity?\n * Section 4.1: \"by learning to inferring\" --> \"by learning to infer\".\n * Section 4.1: The proposed loss computes errors between the observed transition quantities and the respective predictions at each step---the latter of which are, importantly, functions of intermediate predictions. The authors claim this choice is preferable to using observed quantities in place of the intermediate predictions. Presumably, this choice allows gradients to flow back through time and assign credit more effectively than the alternative. The last few sentences of the final paragraph could make this point more clearly.\n * Section 4.2: Defining the parameters before they are used in $\\mathcal{C}^0$ would add clarity to this section.\n * Section 4.2: Equation 4 should explicitly state that $\\hat{s}_{t_0}=s_{t_0}$ .\n * Section 4.2: Are your action distributions are unconditional on any context?\n * Section 4.2: You are overloading notation for $d$ . Consider using $\\text{d}$ or some other notation do avoid overloading.\n * Algorithm 1: \"Execute the first action ...\"---It would add clarity to write out the action using your notation.\n * Algorithm 1: The \"training\" variable is never defined, so it is unclear why the conditional statement is included. I understand what the paper hopes to communicate here: there is an initial period of data gathering with no updates. However, the pseudocode should either reflect this more accurately or it should exclude this logic---considering it as an implementation detail.\n * Figure 3: It would be more accurate to label the vertical axis \"Average Episodic Return\", as the reward is just a momentary quantity.\n * Table 1: I need help understanding these results, because they don't seem consistent with Figure 3. In Figure 3., DLPA achieves the highest performance in Platform and Goal. Why then is HyAR bolded?\n * Section 5.2: \"action-spercialized\"?\n * Section 5.3: \"that just do random shooting\"---fix grammar.\n * Section 5.3: The last paragraph needs a grammatical revision.\n * Section 5.3: The last paragraph could do a better job explaining why Random Shooting fails.\n * This algorithm seems to use a heavy amount of computation. Can you comment on the algorithm's complexity?"

                "value": "This paper addresses the problem of model-based reinforcement learning for parameterized action markov decision processes (PAMDPs), by proposing a framework referred to as Dynamics Learning and Predictive Control with Parameterized Actions (DLPA). The core idea of DLPA lies in the integration of neural-network based model learning (transition model, termination model, and reward function) and the model predictive control using model predictive path integral. Extensive experiments against multiple baseline algorithms for PAMDP are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of DLPA."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The novelty seems rather limited as the main framework of DLPA follows the standard data-driven MPPI, with the contextualization from MDP to PAMDPs. For example, an information theoretic MPC framework was proposed in [G. Williams et al, ICRA 20217] to incorporate the model learning in the MPPI-based planning procedure. \n\n- Some key information is not provided, e.g. which neural network algorithms are used to optimize Eq. 1?\n\n- No theoretical analysis is given to justify the performance applied to PAMDPs, which seems necessary to help readers understand the significance of the DLPA beyond simple contextualization of data-driven MPPI to PAMDPs. As PAMDPs concerned about finding the right action and the associated parameters to use, is there any guarantee of convergence to the selected parameterized actions during training from DLPA?"

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. What is the main contribution behind DLPA, or could authors comment on specific challenges solved when using MPPI for PAMDPs?\n\n2. What algorithms are used to solve Eq. 1 in terms of model learning? Also, it is unclear why the authors imply that the ground truth state was not used as input to train their model in DLPA. For example, the ground-truth state s_{t+1} is needed to compute the loss L_joint defined in Eq. 1.\n\n3. Does DLPA deliver any theoretical properties to justify its performance on PAMDPs? Authors are encouraged to discuss the convergence of parameterized actions from the DLPA framework, if any."
