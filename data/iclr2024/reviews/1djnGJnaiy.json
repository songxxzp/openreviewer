            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Since the appendices are not attached to the initial submission and the paper's page limits mean many things are unclear. \n\nAlthough Figure 1 organizes the many processes involved the level of detail is not sufficient to grasp how the dimensions or arrangement of data changes through the processing.  \n\nMany terms are not precisely defined and the reader is left to guess the meaning (e.g. \"temporal graph\"). Some times jargon perhaps from other papers is not explained. \"Functional patching\" is not clear to me.  Another example,  \"while in the brain the functionality of each token is important and a different set of\ntokens should be mixed differently\", I don't understand the word token in this context.  Are the segments akin to attention heads? Calling them segments has a connotation to time.  \n\n**The clarity of the description of the methodology needs improvement:**\n\nIn Section 3.1's \"voxel-mixer section\" the subscript $i$ is not on the interpolated matrix, it appears only  on P and W_flat and isn't consistent. Is this a mistake or meaningful? The dimensions should be listed for these variables to help the reader (same for equation 1). It's not clear to me how softmax and flat operate together. \n\n$t_p$ appears twice and its not clear it has same meaning. Once is the length of the functional patch's time dimension in the \"voxel-mixer section\" and once it is the previous tilmestep in the \"temporal patching\" section. \n\nAt the end of Section 3.2, dimensions are missing and subscripts \"token\" are not clear.  \n\nThe objective function has variables that are not clear (Z_V is not defined) and doesn't match the description which states that mutual information between functional connectivity and voxel activity is maximized. H_voxel and Z_V are both about the voxel activity. And $\\psi$ and Z_F are about the functional connectivity. H_time which is a function of H_voxel is not used in the objective.  \n\nIn notation $\\tilde{T}$ is not defined and probably should also be a function of $t$ if windows of a task are not same length. \n\nIn the \"functional patching\" section, it is not clear if the patches are contiguous voxels or how are voxels in a function system arranged. It is not clear how linear interpretation would work in such a coordinate system unless this uses the 3D location of the voxels/channels. \n\nSome choices in the processing seem arbitrary and the paper doesn't motivate them all. It's not clear to me why the node uses a weighted average of timestamp encodings while the edge uses a single. \n\nA weakness is the lack of discussion of hyper-parameter selection for the method or baselines. At the end of the methodology data augmentation is discussed. This has a number of parameters itself, and itself can account for differences in performance if other methods are not trained on augmented data. The paper states \"The effect of the walk length on performance peaks at a certain point, but the exact value varies with datasets\", which means that a valid hyper-parameter selection algorithm (that does not have access to testing performance) is need. Without a valid hyper-parameter selection the impressive results are called into question. \n\n**Minor:**\n\nIn abstract \"single beta weight\" is jargon. Perhaps a \"single weight relating the voxel activity to the task\".  Also patching is not common in graph terminology, perhaps \"local subgraphs\". \"Temporal graph\" is also not clear from context or standard usage.\n\n\"jointly learn voxel activity and functional connectivity\" -> \"jointly learn representations of the voxel activity and functional connectivity\"\n\n\"minuetes\""

Why is temporal graph used to describe connections between voxels across different time points?\n\nIn the temporal patching section, wouldn't it be better to call it a spatiotemporal random walk? \n\nIs the edge set $\\mathcal{E}^{(t)}$ fixed and how is it defined or computed? \n\nThe operation of softmax in (2) is not clear. Is it element wise to give as output a vector that lies in the probability simplex (argsoftmax) or does it literally return the softmax scalar, and if so which dimension does it operate along?\n \n\n How is hyper-parameter selection performed (including for augmentation)? \n\nAre other methods trained with defaults hyper-parameters or is a fair search done for them? Is the same data augmentation used for all methods?"

The paper is unclear and difficult to follow.\n    1.  \"Dimension reduction\" step of the voxel-Mixer should learn time-window specific spatial components in $W_{\\mbox{segment}}^{(s)}$ since logically the voxels needs to be grouped into ROIs. However $\\tilde{X}^{(t)}W^{(s)}_{\\mbox{segment}}$ seems to be reducing time, not space. Notation is fairly mixed up making it difficult to follow what has been done exactly.\n    2.  \"Functional connectivity encoder\" starts with a connectivity graph $\\cal{G}_{F}$ where does that graph come from? This section is also unclear - the source of patches and how they are mixed is very difficult to discern.\n    3.  Evaluation tasks cite evaluation in classifying ADHD and ASD but results are not reported in Table 1.\n    4.  Experiments are not clearly explained. Specifically, how the test and train sets were split?\n2.  The contribution to either the ML or Neuroimaging is unclear\n    1.  For ML: it appears the paper is proposing to train a model on the functional connectivity graph and another model with a comparable number of parameters on time series. The number of parameters relative to the BNT used in the benchmark roughly doubles since the Temporal Graph Mixer in this paper is doing about what BNT is doing. This parameter doubling not surprisingly leads to improved performance. This is not explained.\n    2.  For ML: since clasification accuracy is of a major concern, why not compare to Logistic Regression on the FNC data as a much simpler model with much fewer parameters?\n    3.  For Neuroimaging: The paper does not show what are the learned voxel groupings. Note, all voxel-level analysis papers with which the current submission contrast the work obtain biologically interpretable voxel maps. The current model supposedly should capture spatial maps like that since it is operating at the voxel level input from subjects. However, these maps are neither presented nor discussed.\n    4.  For Neuroimaging: What is the significance of Table 2? This problem is almost a toy problem on a synthetic task. This task is barely relevant to the neuroimaging field and the cited workshop is the only paper that uses this synthetic data generation approach for testing the method.\n    5.  For Neuroimaging: Why the ROIs in Figure 3 are so carefully delineated? The described methods would be unlikely to produce such precisely carved spatial maps. This result is unclear.\n3.  Some relatively minor problems:\n    1.  Abstract: \"toward **revealing the understanding**\" what do you exactly mean?\n    2.  Abstract: \"we bridge this gap\", which gap? This is strangely phrased\n    3.  The first paragraph of the introduction section is awkwardly written and can gain a lot from a rewrite.\n    4.  Page 2: Limitations state that most studies focus on either voxel level or functional connectivity. However, to study functional connectivity researchers usually first extract intrinsic networks from the voxel level, by running ICA, RBM, NMF, Dictionary Learning or any other decomposition. The statement does not seem to hold.\n    5.  Page 3 lats paragraph of section 2: MEG and EEG do not readily provide localization of the time-series to parts of the brain. The sensor space recordings need to be projected to the brain volume or surface by overcoming the difficulties of an ill-posed inverse problem.\n    6.

It is unclear whether the manuscript uses all available data during unsupervised/self-supervised pre-training or only the training set. Otherwise, when all the data is used, the self-supervised model may already remember the data, boosting the performance in downstream tasks on the test subset.\n  - The cross-validation is unclear. Do you use training, validation, and hold-out sets? Validation sets must be used only to determine hyperparameters and checkpoints. The final performance must be reported on the hold-out test set.\n  - Furthermore, did you ensure that splits do not contain the same subjects?\n  - The comparison in Table 2 seems unfair when the setting is not described: the type of encoders and their capacity, the type of modalities used for downstream tasks, and whether pre-training is used. Baselines can use architectures with different capacities or might not utilize pre-training; hence, the performance might be worse due to capacity, use of concatenated embeddings from fMRI and FNC, or warm start.\n- Rigor:\n  - Table 1: There is no description of class distribution; hence, using Accuracy in Table 1 is unjustified, and you need to use additional metrics.\n  - Table 2: It is unclear whether the models give well-calibrated predictions because AUC's shortcoming is that it does not measure whether a prediction is calibrated. Hence, you might have better performance with worse calibration.\n  - Table 2: Anomaly detection asks for AUC PR because there are many \"normal\" cases and very few \"anomalous\" cases.\n  - Statistical analysis for Table 2 and Table 3 has not been performed. Please compare statistically the performance of the models (best versus other) and then correct p-values for multiple comparisons.\n\n- Clarity: \n  - The manuscript should clearly show that, specifically, joint pre-training of fMRI with Functional Connectivity is beneficial as the first contribution. The second contribution is the improvement of MLPMixer to fMRI and functional connectivity. The third contribution is \nfunctional patching. Currently, it is not clear whether the main performance comes from the proposed encoder architectures, functional patching, the unsupervised multimodal pre-training itself, or concatenated embeddings from fMRI and FNC. There are a lot of contributions that could be ablated and compared separately with other baselines.\n  - The section \"How Does Brain Detect GAN Generated Images?\" has a very cramped discussion, and the experiment design is unclear. What was the performance of the GAN used in synthesized images? Also, the differences are shown only visually, and no numerical values are shown on how these distributions differ globally and locally (region-wise).\n  - Figure 3 shows the distribution of detected abnormalities. How do you get the distribution? Where is the color bar? How do you test? Do you show the p-value, or do you show the effect size? Have you done FDR corrections based on p-values?\n\n- Missing related work:\n  - MLP mixer has been applied previously to fMRI data (Geenjaar et al., 2022). Additionally, in the same work, spectral clustering was used to develop a patching strategy for fMRI data. I have not found ablation for the patching approach in this work; it is unclear how the proposed patching is better.\n\nGeenjaar, Eloy, et al. \"Spatio-temporally separable non-linear latent factor learning: an application to somatomotor cortex fMRI data.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.13640 (2022)."
