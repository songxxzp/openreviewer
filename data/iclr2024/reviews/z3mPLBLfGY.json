Also, learning/refining the self-attention has been investigated (e.g. [1]).\n\nUnclear how (5) is different from (Jin and al.)'s pooling.\n\nThere is some lack of motivation as to why one needs to keep track of the coordinates (which requires all the equivariant design of the non-self-attention layers) rather than working with equivariant measures such as the interatomic pairwise distances as most works do (and using other metrics too, e.g. C-RMSD [3,4]).\n\nIt is unclear (at least at first sight without looking at the appendix) how equation (10) is E(3)-equivariant (especially rotation).\n\nMost importantly (and that's related to question 2), it's unclear (given the well-known properties of Transformers with long-range dependencies processing) why hierarchical processing is better than atom-level analysis.\n\n2. Assessment: \n\nIn order to have a good comparison with the baselines, one should add the models' complexity and capacity comparison.\nThus, while comparing to old baselines such as Shnet or Dimenet++ (Tables 2 and 3), one should compare the difference in capacity and complexity of the models which still perform well and should be much more efficient.\n\n[1]  Geometric transformer for end-to-end molecule properties prediction.\n\n[2]  PhysNet: A Neural Network for Predicting Energies, Forces, Dipole Moments, and Partial Charges\n\n[3] Molecular geometry prediction using a deep generative graph neural network\n[4] Diffusion-based molecule generation with informative prior bridges"
