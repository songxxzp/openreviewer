The pipeline first generate center position for each building, and then autoregressively generate the polygon shapes of the building. The model is trained in a MAE fashion, and at inference time iteratively generates the masked building position and shape conditioned on existing unmasked ones. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this two-stage approach. Further experiments on generating buildings with extruded height are also shown for completeness."

The autoregressive transformer is also more capable as it can generate arbitrary polygon shapes as opposed to just the 2D bounding boxes. Results are very extensive including ablation studies of the two-stage versus one-stage. Overall I am satisfied with the quality and novelty of this work."

Some important evaluation metrics are also missing. A large autoregressive transformer (e.g. 12 layers) is prone to overfitting to the training set. Since the generated output are vector sequences, it should be easy to evaluate the novelness and uniqueness scores as in SkexGen (Autoregressive generation of CAD construction sequences) or CurveGen (Engineering sketch generation for computer-aided design). That way we will know the model is not simply remembering the training set."

While the domain (city generation) and the combination of techniques are novel (conditioning polygon generation directly on the location distribution), such novelty are likely not directly useful for people who are not interested in this particular problem. Subsequently, results quality would matter much more and\n- The evaluation is underwhelming. Most baselines are for general layout problems that has much weaker constraints than the specific problem. The one baseline that addresses this problem (AETree) is a weak one the doesn't even compete with more general methods. Even with this set of baselines, I am not sure whether the proposed method really generates better layout, based on the qualitative results. The quantitative metrics are too generic (FID is too general for evaluating such layout visualizations, WD over edge/area/ratio doesn't really evaluate layout quality), the user/perceptual study is also not well conducted (ground truth shouldn't have minor noises, visualizations of layout should be better so humans can actually judge if the layouts are good i.e. not just with blue boxes/meshlab screenshots).\n- Lack of evaluation over whether the method can generate novel and diverse layouts that are different from the training set. I am not convinced that the model is not overfitting to some training samples. \n- The problem setting isn't particularly useful: without streets, roads, building types and other city elements, I can't see how this can be helpful in any real city planning / modeling tasks. I am also not sure whether representing buildings as 2D polygon contours adds much over just specifying the location and size of buildings: one would need to model the 3D building in some other ways anyways.\n- A few technical issues that need to be addressed: see questions below."

Could the authors clarify what exactly happens in phase 1? If the model indeed predicts occupancy, then more analysis is needed on how it is converted into positions (as mentioned in Appendix D)\n- The distribution predicted by phase 1 also seems extremely blurry and doesn't really resemble a probability distribution. It almost seems to me that the method is just attempting to memorize the silhouettes of buildings. A bit more analysis would be great here.\n- In section 4, it mentioned that weights need to be applied to BCE to address class imbalance, this shouldn't happen if the model can actually learn the distribution. It seems that after applying such weights, there isn't really too much difference between high/low likelihood, which is not ideal.\n- Finally, I am not sure if it make sense to learn the entire distribution over many buildings: shouldn't the distribution just be completely uniform since all buildings can take all locations without additional constraints? Shouldn't the probability be zero over locations with existing buildings? Some clarifications are again needed."
