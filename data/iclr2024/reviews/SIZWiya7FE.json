A detailed explanation will be better because in VAE we want to maximize the log-likelihood of data and then formulate an ELBO term. In this case, a detailed derivation with proper assumption will help to see how it is a VAE. What do we want to maximize here?\n2.

This novel formulation expands the scope of unlearning research and adds a crucial dimension to privacy-preserving machine learning techniques. \n\nThe paper also offers a potential impact for forgetting in deep models, emphasizing the importance of forgetting representations rather than just the correspondence between representations and labels, aligning with deep learning's characteristic of shared representation information between forgotten and retained data. \n\nThe proposed supervision-free unlearning method, leveraging variational techniques to model task-relevant representations' distribution, is a novel contribution. This approach allows for effective information removal from the model and employs a contrastive loss to ensure model restoration, successfully mitigating the influence of forgetting data and maintaining performance on the remaining data. The strength also lies in its comprehensive experimental validation across various tasks, including data forgetting, category forgetting, and denoising for noisy data.
