I think this will significantly hinder the practical application of rate-encoded SNN.\n\n2. In Tab.1, the author's comparative perspective is that the robustness of constant-encoded SNN under PGD (C) is weaker than that of rate-encoded SNN under PGD (R), so rate-encoded SNN is better. However, I noticed that the robustness of constant-encoded SNN is better than that of rate-encoded SNN under GN attacks (CIFAR10: 90.62% v.s. 78.62%, CIFAR-100: 66.46% v.s. 50.43%), and at the same time, constant-encoded SNN maintains good defense against FGSM (R) and PGD (R). **Therefore, it seems that the so-called superior robustness of rate-encoded SNN does not have a good generalization effect, and it cannot maintain good defense ability under different attacks, which is an obvious limitations.**"

Yet it is not very clear what the novelty exactly is (e.g. as also stated by the authors Stalman et al. 2009 did combine adversarial training and randomized smoothing. Is it the adaption to SNNs? The modifications required for the attack?). This should be more clear. Further, the manuscript claims new state-of-the-art performance in the abstract. But only \"compare the performance of the proposed methods with state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms\" in the Experiments. These are two slightly different statements, and they should be clearly formulated (i.e. what is state-of-the-art (is there a well-established state-of-the-art in the field?), and exactly which proposed method beats it?). While the authors do discuss the obtained certified radius in section 5.3, these certifications seem way smaller than for the ANN case [2]. While a direct comparison is not necessary, this should be discussed more explicitly. \n\n* **Empirical details and clarity of experimental results**: The manuscript lacks a more comprehensive description of experimental details, which should be added to the appendix i.e., how many PGD iterations, all the training details for all adversarial training methods, the cost of training with the different methods (GPUs, time), \u2026 . There also is only a brief discussion of the empirical results, and some of the results are unclear/surprising to me (see questions). This should be discussed in more detail.\n\n* **Comparison between certified and empirical robustness**: The manuscript does analyze both the empirical and certified robustness. Yet, does treat them mostly independently. It would be helpful to e.g. take Fig 1 (d) (i.e. the empirical robustness for various epsilon) and also plot the certified robustness (with radius r=epsilon). This information is already displayed in Table 3 (although for a much smaller radius). This would nicely showcase the gap between empirical and certified robustness. While the authors do not claim tightness of the certifications, this at least should be discussed/visible.\n\n\n\n## Minor issues and recommendations:\n\n* The authors state that certified defense methods based on convex relaxations and branch and bound are restricted to ReLU activations. This is incorrect as [1], does generalize to general activation functions. The claim that these methods do not apply to SNNs may still hold and should be checked by the authors.\n* Some of the proofs rely on the differentiability of g with respect to x. It might be good to point out that g is differentiable with respect to x, even if f is not differentiable with respect to z (as is the case for SNNs, just for clarity).\n* There are some language errors (e.g. page 2 row 25) and formatting errors (whitespace in front of citations e.g. page1 first paragraph last row, page 2 row 11, ...).\n\n\n\n\n[1] Formal Verification for Neural Networks with General Nonlinearities via Branch-and-Bound  (Zhouxing Shi et. al.)\n\n[2] https://sokcertifiedrobustness.github.io/leaderboard/"

As fgsm(C) and pgd(C) do work well as expected, shouldn't this indicate that rate-encoding messes up the attack algorithms (i.e., because the gradients become noisy)?\n* As one tests attacks on both encodings (C/R), it might be good also to have clean (C/R), no? (it is rather interesting to me that models trained on C, do work that well on fgsm(R) and pgd(R) and visa versa)\n* Adversarial training is performed both for FGSM and PGD. As PGD is the \u201cstronger\u201d adversary, I would expect it to be more robust, yet it is not. Especially, the PGD-adversarially trained network performs worse than an FGSM-adversarially trained network if tested against a PGD adversary. This result seems counterintuitive and is consistent across different datasets. Why? What PGD adversary was employed during training (as the evaluation PGD is as expected better than FGSM) ?"
