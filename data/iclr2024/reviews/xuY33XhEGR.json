Unlike traditional black-box models, ClimODE incorporates the concept of advection from statistical mechanics, ensuring that the model considers the spatial movement of weather quantities over time. The model employs neural ODEs to model the weather evolution with value-conserving dynamics. The architecture includes components for local convolutions and global attention, allowing it to capture both local and global weather influences. ClimODE also addresses uncertainty in predictions and source variations through a probabilistic emission model. This feature allows the model to quantify prediction uncertainties and adapt to various source variations. ClimODE is reported to outperform existing data-driven methods in global and regional forecasting."

ClimODE follows the partial differential continuity equation and solves a latent equation in such a form, and this makes both the physical insights and model training easier to understand and follow. Because of the use of Neural ODE, the prediction would be continuous in spacetime. I like the cute and nice idea.\n\n2. Model Design: The use of both local convolutions and global attention allows the model to capture a wide range of influences on weather patterns, enhancing its predictive capabilities with both locality inductive bias and long-term interaction capability. The model\u2019s ability to quantify uncertainty and/or model source variation is an additional advantage, making its forecasts more reliable and comprehensive (like a latent force). The spatio-temporal embedding also gives the model extra power to reflect the geographical differences with spatial-temporal variation, which makes a lot of sense.\n\n3. Performance and Efficiency: ClimODE achieves superior performance over some existing deep learning weather forecasting models, with an order of magnitude smaller parameterization, making it computationally efficient. \n\n4.

Limited Performance and Comparison: The proposed model, although surpasses vanilla Neural ODE and ClimaX, still cannot compete with IFS (ECMWF NWP), let alone bigger models such as FourCastNet and Pangu-Weather that have already reported better results than NWP. There lacks enough comparison to other models in general, such as Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (practiced by FourcastNet), previous weather forecasting methods like [1, 2], even models for similar tasks such as spatio-temporal traffic forecasting or video forecasting, etc. Comparison to Neural ODE is more of an ablation study and ClimaX is a weak baseline marginally better than ResNet. Comparing only with ClimaX is definitely not convincing enough. \n\n2. Limited Physical Complexity: The partial differential continuity equation is indeed a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics as it describes how quantities such as mass, moisture, or energy are transported and conserved in the atmosphere over time and space. What makes it less predictive in the real world is that this equation comes with assumptions such as the homogeneity and isotropy of the fluid. In cases where these assumptions are violated, the equation might not hold perfectly. I am not certain whether relying too much on this physical equation would be optimal for modeling the complex dynamics of weather, especially in finer-granular resolution with more weather factors and potentially larger noises. \n\n3. Limited Physical Understanding: In all, the partial differential continuity equation is a general-form conservation equation rather than any specific equations explaining each weather factor. Other than that, because neural ODE is essentially still a black-box model due to using neural network, it remains hard to know, for example, the relationships and the interactions between different weather variables. \n\n[1] Yan Han, Lihua Mi, Lian Shen, CS Cai, Yuchen Liu, Kai Li, and Guoji Xu.

Those benchmarks are exceptional since they excel NWP results in many cases and have been tested/used even for recent disaster predictions. It is just like the LLM that, if it becomes powerful enough, everyone will be amazed and will use it. If the ultimate goal of this paper is to propose a strong SOTA model against existing models, it is strongly recommended to compare with those large models and consider adapting to this line in the future research. \n\nSince the paper mentions efficiency, I wonder how does the model perform with more parameters. Would the performance increase? Or, it is more like a nice small model to save us from excessive computational burden?\n\nAre there any reasons why ClimODE performs worse than ClimaX in t2m? \n\nHow does the model perform with long-term prediction, say, for 7 days or 14 days? The authors mention the emission source model as a strong inductive bias that prevents long-horizon forecast collapses and it seems to work based on the ablation study, so I wonder that."

Neural ODEs are used to model the continuity PDE and the flow velocity is parametrized using a neural net that has two components: A CNN that models local interactions and an attention mechanism that model long-range interactions. Furthermore, an emission model is added on top that serves to estimate first and second order moments of the true underlying solution (bias and uncertainty). \n\nClimODE greatly outperforms the baseline NODE which doesn't take into account the physical principles of advection nor does it correct its solution by the proposed emisison models, moreover, ClimODE also outperform ClimaX, one of the recent state-of-the-art weather forecasting models on the regridded 5.625 \u00b0 ERA5 data.\n\nFinally, strong ablation study results are shown that indicate the important role of taking into account the underlying physical principles as well as the emission model."

While the conclusion that: $$\\mathbb{E}_x[u_k(\\mathbf{x},t)]=\\text{const.}$$\n\nsounds intuitive, it's not justified rigourously. The expectation is taken with respect to which density? I would expect the quantity to be preserved would be $\\int_{\\Omega} u_k(\\mathbf{x},t)dV$, since that's the total quantity over the whole \"volume\" you're considering which should be preserved (e.g. when $u_k=\\rho$, the integral over the volume becomes the mass). In any case, since this is a Machine Learning submission, it would be better if this part is thoroughly justified. \n\n- Benchmark only up to 36 hours while state-of-the-art methods reported results for up to 10 days ahead. The paper would be better if it reported results for at least five or seven days ahead.\n- Authors mention that other deep learning methods lacked open-source code, while that's true for PanguWeather (who only provide a pseudo-code \"implementation\"), it's not for the others:\n    - FourCastNet: https://github.com/NVlabs/FourCastNet\n    - GraphCast: https://github.com/google-deepmind/graphcast\n\n Given that GraphCast seem to outperform ClimaX, it would have been good to compare against it as well and also FourCastNet since it's one of the first papers to perform weather forecasting on such a scale.\n- Authors claim that the vaue-preserving manifold (that emanates from the closed system assumption), presents a strong inductive bias for long-term forecasts, yet, using Euler scheme to solve the ODE is known to be unstable and it'll especially not conserve the quantity we want preserved, so that inductive bias is no longer enforced. It would be better to include that limitation in the paper and acknowledge that while it is a strong inductive bias, it's hard to enforce in practice. This is further seen from Table 2 which shows that the error does increase dramatically with lead time and that suggests that ClimODE is better at inferring the true physics but not in mitigating the error propagation in long-term forecasts.\n- While Figure 6 shows qualitatively the soundness of the predicted bias and variance, there's no quantitative approach that evaluates the quality of the bias and variance output by the model.

                "value": "1. What do you mean by one-shot GAN referring to Ravuri et al., 2021? Is there any pre-training involved\n2. There is Weatherbench 2 available now, maybe to recent to be included in this submission, but should be mentioned in future work: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15560, https://sites.research.google/weatherbench/\n3. Are any of the competing methods such as GraphCast, PanguWeather, FourCastNet that now available?\n4. Is the comparison against ClimaX fair? The main idea of ClimaX is to use pre-training, but you state you use all methods without pertaining\n5. The statement \"IFS is still far ahead of any deep learning method\" doesn't really hold anymore, e.g.: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10128.pdf\n6. Kreislers GNN work should be mentioned here as well: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07575.pdf\n7. This work could be useful too: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04664.pdf"
