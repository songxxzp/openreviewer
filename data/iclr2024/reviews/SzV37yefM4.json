                "value": "This paper explores how well Contrastive Decoding (CD), an alternative generation strategy proposed by Li et al. in 2022, performs on reasoning tasks. It reformulates CD and introduces a hyperparameter \\beta, which controls the strength of the contrastive penalty. Contrastive Decoding (CD) can significantly improve over greedy decoding on some reasoning tasks, especially arithmetic tasks such as GSM8K. It can also yield smaller gains on commonsense reasoning tasks with large models and some contrastive ranking tasks such as HSwag. However, CD can degrade performance on other tasks, such as MATH and commonsense reasoning tasks with smaller models. Relative to greedy decoding, CD performs worse on arithmetic skills, better on logical reasoning, and can harm factual recall.\nThe paper shows that CD works better under certain conditions, such as when using weaker amateur models and with chain-of-thought prompting. Although the paper reports most of its experiments on LLAMA models, it does show that CD can produce small gains on FLAN-T5 in one experiment."

What would happen if you used smaller models? Given that CD can benefit from mid-training checkpoints, I believe studying smaller models as amateur models would be interesting. Perhaps you could use a different family of models and experiment with cross-family \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d models.\n\nIf contrastive decoding improves overall generation quality, it should ideally exhibit some improvement in the results without the presence of CoT in the prompts. Do you have any insights on why this is not happening?\n\nIn Fig.9 the FLOP increase of self-consistency is compared to contrastive decoding. Self-consistency does not have a hyper-parameter. How would you factor in your hyper-parameters (and search) in the FLOPS increase for CD?\n\nNot a question, but I think that Fig.1 could benefit from an \u201cAverage\u201d row at the top as well (at least the greedy generations)."
