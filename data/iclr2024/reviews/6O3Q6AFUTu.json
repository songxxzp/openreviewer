                "value": "A new approach to image interpolation with diffusion models is presented, where a new image is interpolated from two other images (in contrast to interpolating pixels within a single image).  While exisitng methods work reasonably well with images generated by a diffusion model, they do not work well with natural images not generated from the diffusion model.  Resulting interpolated images exhibit considerable artefacts.  Theory is introduced to explain the reason for the failure and suggest how to mitigate it.  A novel approach is presented to add appropriate noise to the natual images considered but at the same time ensure the interpolated image is faithful to the two images it is generated from.  A number of experiments are presented that demonstrate the improvement in interpolated image quality compared to the standard spherical interpolation approach."

The background and existing approaches are clearly explained, highlighting the tradeoff between realsim (i.e. avoiding artefacts) and faithfulness (i.e. ensuring consistency with the source images).  \n\nThe reason for the existing failure for natural images is related the mismatched noise levels, which arises due to the concentration of probability in high dimensions.  A numerical experiment (Fig. 3) is performed to support this hypothesis and Theorem 1 is presented to provide further support.  I believe Theorem 1 is a fairly well-known result.  Nevertheless, a proof is presented in Appendix A (I initially did not appreciate a proof was provided; in the main body of the article the reader should be pointed to Appendix A for the proof).\n\nFurther theory is presented in Theorem 2 to guide a solution to the problem (again, in the main body the reader should be pointed to the proof of Theorem 2 in Appendix B).  Based on the provided theory a novel diffusion-based image interpolation approach is presented, combining an SDEdit-like stage, followed by interpolation in latent space, followed by denoising with the diffusion model.  The interpolation approach introduces a number of free parameters to address contrast issues and trade-off consistence with each source image.  Standard spherical interpolation and linear interpolation combined with SDEdit are recovered as special cases for specific parameter choices.\n\nThe resulting interpolation method is simple but appears to work well.  I expect it to be of considerable practical use."

Experiments are performed to demonstrate the impact of different parameter choices, which are helpful.  In terms of overall interpolation quality in comparison to existing techniuqes, a number of examples a presented where the proposed method is demonstrated to be visually superior to existing approaches.  While further examples are presented in the appendices, in total just a handful of images are considered.  Given the artefacts that arise with existing techniques, I don't doubt that the proposed method is superior.  However, to further support this it would be useful to have some metric to summarize performance over a large test data-set.  I appreciate this may not be trivial but I wonder if the authors have any thoughts on how they could assess performance over a large test-set?\n\nBoundary control methods are introduce in Section 4.4 but are not explained.  The appendix is referenced but that only contains an additional figure of results.  The boundry control methods should be discussed somewhere.  In general Appendix B feel incomplete.  While I appreciate papers should stand on their own, without Appendices, if that is the case then further detail needs to be provided in the main body.\n\nThere seem to be a number of minor typos throughout where spaces a missing, typically following a period or comma."

It investigates how inappropriate noise introduction and estimation (overestimation and underestimation of noise level) affects image quality, leading to artifacts and loss of original style in the interpolated images. The study aims to address these limitations by proposing a novel interpolation approach that strategically imposes boundary constraints (i.e. clipping) on the introduced noise (at inversion steps), aligning with the hypersphere centered around the Gaussian distribution. This approach aims to mitigate noise artifacts and improve image quality, preserving the essential characteristics of the original image while efficiently removing artifacts. Additionally, the paper explores the integration of different interpolation methods, such as linear spherical interpolation and SDEdit, to overcome the identified limitations and achieve satisfactory results in both training and natural image domains."
