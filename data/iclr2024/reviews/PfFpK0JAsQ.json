            "questions": {
                "value": "It is confusing to explain (4) as the self-representation problem if B is arbitrary basis matrix since they may not come from the input data matrix X.  Taking PCA for example, the columns of B are orthogonal, but they are not from the input feature space. Moreover, B defined as a square matrix of size m is inconsistent with the sleeted r bases in section 3.3.\n\nIn section 3.1, authors mentioned that two features have a similar structure in the feature space, and it is expected Bg_l and Bg_r have similar structure. What does the similar structure mean? How is the similarity measured? In other words, it is unclear how the matrix A is constructed. \n\nThe derivation in section 3.2 depends on the assumption that XU=B. As B is a set of feature vectors selected from input data, it is unclear whether the assumption still holds or not. Similarly for Theorem 3.1, it is trivial to have if the assumption holds. \n\nThe variance basis extension is to simply change the selection order of feature vectors in terms of variance score of feature vectors. It is possible that for each individual feature, the variance is high, but is it similar to say the largest amount of data dispersion? \n\nFor completeness, authors should describe the derivation process on how equations (9)-(11) are obtained. Since all three equations are fractional, is it possible that any of the denominators can be zero? How is it handled?\n\nIn Algorithm 1, the selected features are derived from U. However, U is not directly related to the input X instead to B and G, unless BG=X. However, B is selected feature vectors from input space. It is unclear why the assumption can hold. So why is the selection rule proper?\n\nThe computation complexity is quite high since it is quadratic to both the number of samples and the number of features comparing with most of baseline methods.\nThe application to the PneumoniaMNIST dataset is quite interesting. However, the way of presenting the outcomes can be improved significantly.  For example, what is the interested region? how many selected features are in the interested region? How do other compared methods perform? The validation is not quantified. How many radiologists are involved in the evaluation?  What is the performance measured? These plots shown in Fig. 2 delivers less useful information except that more red points are accumulated in the center when the number of selected features increases."
