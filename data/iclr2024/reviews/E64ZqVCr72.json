The density estimation approach is incorrect. You cannot reason about probability densities by comparing cosine similarities of **arbitrarily distributed** vectors (e.g., imagine the case where several dimensions are strongly correlated).\n4. In fact most of your objectives suffer from that same problem - the similarities can easily be inflated if multiple dimensions are not independent. Consider using a more probabilistically sound approach, e.g., by incorporating models such as normalizing flows"

The problem at hand involves two data domains: the source and target domains, with a distribution shift between them. The algorithm comprises two key steps. In the first step, data (images) in both domains are transformed into a latent space using two separate autoencoders, and the feature representations in the latent space are disentangled into domain-specific and task-specific representations. It is assumed that the domain-specific representations account for the distribution shift. In the second step, criteria were designed to select informative unlabeled image samples in the target domain for labeling. The labeled image samples are then added to the labeled image samples from the source domain to update the classification model trained on the labeled data from the source domain. This process can be repeated multiple times. The proposed method was evaluated on two public image analysis datasets and outperformed several state-of-the-art active learning methods and a couple of domain adaptation algorithms."

While 10% still represents a significant number, considering the constraints in the research setting\u2014such as limited and expensive expertise in the medical field\u2014it would be more valuable to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method with much fewer labeled samples from the target domain, for example, 0.1% or 1%. Unfortunately, this aspect is missing in the paper.\n\n2. The discussion section or the presentation of the paper could be improved. For instance, in the ablation study, each component of the loss function and the metrics for identifying informative data samples was thoroughly examined, and their contributions were reported in the tables. However, there is a lack of in-depth discussion and no clear claims have been made regarding which component contributes more.
