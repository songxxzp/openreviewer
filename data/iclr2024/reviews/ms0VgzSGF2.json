Nevertheless, the authors manged to fit the most interesting information in the page limit, and hence I will focus only on the main text. \n\nGiven by the number of works focusing on representation learning (Table 1), it is clear that it is an important topic. Hence the theoretical connections given in the paper between the individual parts of the abstractions is very significant to avoid double and superfluous work. Also, the contribution about stop-gradients, connection to representation collapse and the experiments showing the rank of the weight matrices is very interesting. The theoretical part of the paper is very well done and would alone justify my rating of the paper. \n\nIn the experimental section, the authors verify their theoretical contributions. The experiments about stop-gradients are good. The experiments showing different variants of the minimalistic algorithm (Figure 3) are somewhat inconclusive, or require further discussion (e.g., claims about better/similar performance compared to ALM(3), or no justification for superior performance of ALM on Humanoid). I appreciate the negative result in 5.2 for ZP objective hypothesis."

I think this is somewhat obvious, which is the reason we have all these works on representation learning (this is not a criticism, just a remark).\n  - Is it broadly to categorize the entire zoo of representation learning algorithms into their essential components i.e. $\\phi_{Q^*}$, $\\phi_L$, $\\phi_O$ and just study how they perform empirically?\n  - Misc point: \n     - I understand the point of the different loss function and representation collapse experiments, and those are useful.\n     - It would be very useful to include $\\textit{why}$ it is important to test the questions that are posed in Section 5, and what the final algorithm recommendation should be.\n     - The paper discusses this paradox of choice, but I still find it unclear how to make a choice at the end of the paper.\n2. The sample efficiency claims in Section 5.1 are unclear to me. It appears that ALM(3) outperforms $\\phi_L$ in all cases. It is true that $\\phi_L$ does better than $\\phi_{Q^*}$, but the former does not seem to be. I would suspect that ALM(3) will do better because it is explicitly learning a reward model, whereas $\\phi_L$ is suggesting that the reward model/representations are implicitly learned based on their implication graph.\n3. Is there intuition for why $\\phi_O$ may struggle with distractors? The question is posed in the empirical section, but it\u2019s a bit unclear what motivates this question.\n\nI should note that I do like the paper, but the above things are confusing.

The framework allows a large number of representation learning methods to be evaluated side-by-side while controlling for other factors, which enables the paper to present and evaluate several hypotheses about the various learning objectives.

I suspect the community will find this quite valuable.\n\nThe paper also offers interesting insights, such as the fact that online targets do not guarantee the same fixed points as the objectives with stop-gradients.\n\nThe proposed \"minimalist\" approach is extremely simple and clean. It's shocking that this hasn't been tried before, yet I cannot think of an example where it has. Time will tell if this approach generalizes to other problems, but if it does, it will greatly simplify many projects that rely on representation learning.\n\nThe experiments seem well designed, the baselines seem well chosen, and the results look promising.

According to the plots presented in the paper, the proposed unified algorithm does not outperform (and does not always perform comparably) to algorithms from the literature. Looking at the algorithm pseudocode and implementation, this is not surprising, given that the 'minimalist algorithm' is more of a boilerplate, which, when filled with details, reduces to one of the earlier published algorithms.
