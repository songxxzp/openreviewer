                "value": "This paper proposes a new way to learn \"plannable\" representations. Multi-step inverse dynamics models have the desirable property that the learned representations are guaranteed to contain only the \"controllable\" parts of states. However, they do not necessarily maintain a metric structure, and this lack of distance metrics makes it difficult to use for planning. To resolve this issue, the authors train a contrastive representation on top of the multi-step inverse dynamics-based representations to impose a metric structure. The authors show that this PCLast representations are indeed aware of the inherent temporal structure of the MDP, and that it leads to better performance in several types of environments."

While I see the motivation behind this approach (i.e., we want to first eliminate all the uncontrollable parts, and then impose a metric on another latent representation space), I'm not fully convinced that all of these components are necessary in practice (see the next bullet points for more specific concerns).\n- In the Maze/Sawyer domains, the authors only compare PCLast with ACRO. Given the high complexity of the method, I think it is necessary to show that PCLast is at least better than all the \"basic\" representations that are used as building blocks for PCLast, i.e., IDM, CL, and FDM, to justify the added complexity.\n- The performance of ACRO (the best baseline considered in this work) on the exogenous noise MuJoCo environments seems to be worse than the original performance reported in Islam et al. (2023) (e.g., in `cheetah_run_expert`). Could the authors explain this performance gap? Moreover, given the complexity of PCLast, I believe it requires more thorough empirical comparisons to demonstrate the effectiveness of PCLast (e.g., comparisons on the same set of environments (12 datasets x n distractor configurations) used in ACRO).\n- Also, while the only \"non-toy\" benchmark considered in this work is MuJoCo in Section 4.5, it is unclear how planning helps on MuJoCo tasks (since hierarchical planners seem to be only used in the Maze environments). Given that the main benefit of PCLast is its ability to plan (as the title says), I believe it would be much more convincing if the authors could show this benefit in more practical environments.\n\n[Minor]\n- The paper is using the ICLR 2023 format.\n- Typo (small $\\\\\\|$) after \"we formulate the cost as\" in Appendix D.\n\nI believe this is a borderline paper. While I appreciate the motivation behind PCLast, the empirical results are not strong/extensive enough to justify the need for all five components of PCLast."

Although I like the justification of the loss function through the model of Brownian motion (Appendix B), there are several previously proposed loss functions that seem to solve the same problem. Specifically, the two time-contrastive loss functions I list below pull embeddings of frames nearby in time together and push embeddings of frames far away in time or from completely different videos apart. In the related work, the authors state that time-contrastive learning \u201cis not invariant to exogenous information\u201d, but neither is the proposed loss function. Invariance to exogenous information is achieved by first training the latent space using a prior method, ACRO.\n\nThe loss function proposed in this paper:\n$- \\log \\sigma ( \\beta - \\alpha D(s_t, s_{t+k}) ) - \\log (1 - \\sigma ( \\beta - \\alpha D(s_t, s_r) ) )$\n\nWang et al., 2015:\n$max(0, D(s_t, s_{t+k}) - D(s_t, s_r) + m)$\n\nNair et al., 2022:\n$- \\log \\frac{\\exp S(s_t, s_{t+k}) }{\\exp S(s_t, s_{t+k}) + \\exp S(s_t, s_{t+k+l}) + \\exp S (s_t, s_r)}$\n\nWhere $D$ is a distance function and $S$ is a similarity function between a pair of states.\n\n2. The second main contribution is the entire system of first learning an encoder $\\phi$ using an inverse dynamics loss function, followed by a contastively-learned encoder $\\psi$, followed by a forward model, followed by K-means clustering, followed by a hierarchical planner. I would like to see more justification of this approach. For example, the combination of $\\psi(\\phi(x))$, where $\\phi$, is trained first and frozen, is not fully justified. Could we train a single encoder with multiple losses? Further, the choice of the hierarchical clustering and planning methods could be compared to other hierarchical systems (e.g. Kurutach et al., 2018).\n\n3. (Relatively minor) From the introduction to the methods section, the paper does not flow very well. I think the reason is that the paper lacks focus on its key contribution. If the key contribution was a new and well-justified contrastive learning function, the paper could be written differently. If the key contribution was a system of learning a hierarchical latent space, the paper could also be written differently.

However, it is unclear whether this also applies to more complicated environments with high-dimensional C-space, e.g., robotic manipulation with many objects. If the proposed method is not scalable but still useful for navigation tasks, the paper needs to explain which family of problems can be handled by the proposed approach and which family of problems cannot.\n\n* The proposed planner assumes that latent states in the same cluster are reachable from each other, which may not be true since the latent state representations are approximated and learned from random exploration trajectories. It might not be a problem in the experiments in this paper since the experiments are done in simple 2D navigation and 3D reaching tasks. However, this may fail when a higher-level plan cannot be achieved because an agent cannot reach a waypoint (the center of a cluster in the plan) from the current state. It is required to discuss this issue and how to resolve it. \n\n* The results in Sawyer-Reach do not demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach as explained in Section 4.3. Extensive experiments with more challenging environments that can show the benefit of the proposed approach would strengthen the paper.\n\n* The experiments rely on exploratory data to pre-train the representations. This may not be scalable to more complex environments with many narrow passages in C-space. One alternative could be learning the representations using play data or offline data. This can be an interesting experiment to see."

But, since $x$ is used to describe an observation in the section, it might be better denoted as $\\psi(s)$. Similarly in Section 3.2, $z$ is introduced for a latent state but it could be simply $s$?\n\n* In Section 3.2, $f_\\text{AC}$ is defined to take two latent states but the following sentence says it takes a concatenation of $\\tau + 1$ latent states, which is confusing.\n\n* In Section 3.3, it could be clearer if the latent state spaces induced by $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are defined separately, like $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{Z}$? The definition of the second encoder $\\psi(x): \\mathcal{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Z}$ is kinda confusing as these two spaces are not shared (although they can have the same dimensionality).\n\n* Figure 2 is useful to understand the holistic view of the proposed method. However, it is a bit overwhelming with many symbols. It could be easier to understand this figure if it includes a few image observations for $x$s and uses different shapes or colors for different symbols."
