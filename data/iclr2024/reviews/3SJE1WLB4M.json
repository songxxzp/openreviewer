                "value": "This paper considers a general framework that expresses the generalization error in spectral algorithms. A generic formula is derived for an arbitrary choice of kernel and profile. Then, the analysis is specialized to account for the circle model and the Wishart model. The theory can explain the KRR saturation phenomenon. Finally, a simplified naive model for noisy observations (NMNO) was proposed, for which the generalization error can be neatly expressed, and it is shown that under certain conditions, the circle model and the Wishart model collapse into NMNO."

For instance, although it is claimed at the beginning of the paper that the theory covers gradient descent, what is really done is for gradient flow. Also, when the kernel $K$ is discretized using the samples, the following assumptions are all made about this discrete kernel, and it is not obvious how it can be connected to the continuous kernel.\n* Certain parts of the analysis do not obtain nice closed formulas. For example, those in `section 4` for the Wishart model and those in `section 5` for the noise-free case.\n* Although this is a theoretical paper, it would be helpful to include some experiments, even if they are on synthetic datasets. This helps explain (and justify) the theory."
