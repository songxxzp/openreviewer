                "value": "1. The authors should check their code regarding the CL and SupCL evaluation for poisoning attacks, especially how transforms (augmentations) are performed when preparing the poisoned dataset. It seems that the data augmentation for each image is fixed before the CL (SupCL) training starts in their code. For example, in this case, each positive pair consists of two fixed augmented images. However, the CL (SupCL) algorithm applies different data augmentations each time it reads an image. Once this part of code is not properly configured, the reliability of the algorithm is questionable. For these reasons, I have significant concerns about the CL and SupCL evaluation results reported in this paper.\n2. The novelty of the proposed method is limited. The core of the TP algorithm is a just combination of two existing algorithms, i.e. iteratively updating poisons using TAP and CP to inherit their advantages.\n3. The paper seems inaccurately describe the existing work. \u201cTargeted Adversarial Poisoning (Fowl et al., 2021) can produce poisoning perturbations with high-frequency features that are not linear separable, ...\u201d However, as discussed in Table 1 of [a], TAP perturbations are linear separable.\n4. The main machanism of TP is kind of vague. This paper claims that \u201cwe propose Transferable Poisoning (TP) to generate poisoning perturbations with shared high-frequency characteristics that can be transferred across different learning paradigms (Section 3).\u201d It is unclear why high-frequency perturbation should be a goal for generating transferable poisoning attacks. The proposed algorithm even does not explicitly optimize the frequency of perturbations. In Figure 4, all four attacks are high-frequency but three of them, namely CC, SCP, and WTP have poor transferability. Does it contradict the claim?\n5. Besides the first concern about CL evaluation, I have also concerns about the comparison of attack performance.\n(1)\tTable 1,2,4 do not consider BYOL that was used in the paper of CP. What is the attack performance of TP against BYOL on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100?\n(2)\tIn Table 1, is SimCLR used for CP and TUE perturbation generation? However, SimCLR is not surely the best generation algorithm for transferability of CP and TUE. To be a fair comparison, it is helpful to consider CP and TUE attacks based on other CL algorithms as well as class-wise CP attacks which are effective for SL.\n(3)\tIt would be better to compare your TP with existing powerful poisoning methods (UE, AP, CP and TUE) on larger datasets like CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet.\n6. As the algorithm involves contrastive training, it possibly costs too much time to generate TP perturbations, especially on Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet. Can you provide time consuming comparison of your TP with existing transferable methods like AP, (class-wise) CP, and TUE? Considering availability poisoning attacks are a sort of data protection means, low efficiency of generation might hinder the applications in real world scenarios.\n\n[a] Da Yu, Huishuai Zhang, Wei Chen, Jian Yin, and Tie-Yan Liu. Availability attacks create shortcuts.\n\nClarity, Quality, Novelty And Reproducibility:\nI hope the author would make more clarificaitons about the main machecism of TP and descriptions about existing work. The novelty of proposed algorithm is hindered by the combination of two existing algorithms. For reproducibility, the first concern about CL and SupCL evaluation is vital."

The attack (when not 100% training samples are compromised) is not effective in supervised learning algorithms.\n3. The frequency analyses are not scientifically rigorous.\n4. The novelty of this new poisoning attack is weak.\n5. No defense was discussed.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n\n[Poisoning 100% of the Training Data Is Non-Practical]\n\nI am confident that the paper studies a non-practical scenario: an adversary who poisons 100% of the training data to degrade the accuracy; even with 80% of the training data being compromised, the supervised model retains most of its accuracy compared to clean models.\n\nI haven't seen any real-world scenarios where one allows an adversary to poison 100% of the training data. In any case, the training starts at least with the dataset containing 50% of clean samples.\n\nPrior work on poisoning defenses also theoretically showed that if an adversary can compromise 50% of the training data, there's no guarantee that learning will be empirically successful.\n\nFor these reasons, I also don't think that the transferability should not be measured with the completely compromised datasets.\n\n\n[Not Effective against SL, SupCL, FixMatch]\n\nMy takeaway is that even with the datasets that contain 80--100% of poisoning samples, the three supervised learning algorithms can retain the original accuracy.\n\nThis means (1) the poisoning attack, even with the increased transferability, is weak and easy to defeat, or (2) the three algorithms are designed to be robust inherently to the distributional shifts.\n\nHowever, for this paper, this observation is a weakness as the stronger attack is not actually strong in some settings where a victim does not employ any defenses; the victim could trivially depend on the attack.\n\n\n[Frequency Analyses Are Not Rigorous]\n\nI don't think the paper's claims about the high-frequency components are not scientifically backed by the results. \"High\" means that there will be a quantifiable property, and when used, the proposed poisoning attacks show large numbers. However, the paper is not.\n\nThe paper also claims that the high-frequency characteristics are \"different.\" But it is also not a property that the paper scientifically measures (or compares with criteria). The results are only drawn from the visual analysis. \n\nIt is particularly important to make this claim scientifically rigorous as the reason this poisoning attack is transferable is the paper claims that the perturbations of the attack are the high-frequency ones.\n\n\n[Incremental; Novelty Over the Prior Work]\n\nIt is less surprising that combining the classification- and representation-level losses can lead to general-purpose poisoning samples. Similar techniques have been studied, e.g., one considers all the layer outputs in a neural network for adversarial-example crafting, ensembling multiple models, unrolling the training steps to synthesize effective, transferable targeted poisoning attacks iteratively, etc.\n\n\n[No Defense Evaluation]\n\nSince the attack requires data with 100% poisoning samples, I believe defeating this poisoning attack (or breaking the transferability) is straightforward. I also want to see the discussion about them as a part of responsible vulnerability disclosure.\n\n\nOverall, for those reasons, I am leaning toward rejection."

                "value": "The authors address the problem of generating indiscriminate poisoning attacks that can be applied across various learning paradigms, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning. First, they assess the effectiveness of several existing strategies in terms of their transferability. Then, the authors introduce a novel approach called \"Transferable Poisoning\", which combines two strategies to achieve strong transferability across the considered learning paradigms."

                "value": "The paper provides an interesting contribution to a significant topic, the transferability of poisoning attacks across diverse learning paradigms, an area that has seen limited exploration. The authors introduce a straightforward and intuitive yet effective method, which is tested on a broad range of experiments. The manuscript is well-written overall, though there is space for improvement."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I believe this work has two main weaknesses:\n\n1. There is little emphasis on the motivation for studying transferability across learning paradigms, which limits the impact of the findings. It would greatly benefit the paper to explain the practical contexts where this kind of transferability might be relevant, offering concrete examples and detailing how the conducted experiments address these cases. This is particularly crucial given the pragmatic nature of the contribution.\n\n2. While the frequency analysis provides an intriguing perspective on the problem, it could be explored more thoroughly. The authors argue that generating high-frequency perturbations is key to crafting transferable poisoning attacks. This idea is supported by a simple frequency analysis of perturbations generated by existing methods, and so the proposed approach combines two existing \u2018high-frequency\u2019 poisoning schemes. Nevertheless, there is no attempt to substantiate this claim with evidence confirming the necessity of high-frequency perturbations for achieving transferability.\n\nIn addition to the above points, I have the following minor concerns:\n\n1. More details should be provided on the considered poisoning methods, the associated learning paradigms, and how the models are tested. Please consider adding this information to both the main text and appendix.\n\n2. The results in the tables lack error bars. \n\n3. The frequency analysis is limited to a simple visualisation of the perturbations\u2019 spectrum. Could you provide a more quantitative comparison? Additionally, please define the spectrum and add a scale to the spectrum plots (ticks are missing)."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Can you insert a frequency constraint on the generated perturbations by modifying the loss function? What happens if you impose high or low-frequency perturbations when using different combinations of attack methods? Could this be a way to test the requirement for transferable perturbations to be high-frequency?\n\n2. In some cases, the proposed algorithm \u2018ours\u2019 performs better than the one designed for a given learning paradigm. See for example Table 1, SimSiam and SimCLR: \u2018ours\u2019 outperforms \u2018CP\u2019. Is there an intuitive explanation for this? Analogously, in Table 6, some results indicate that transferred attacks work better on architectures they were not originally designed for. Error bars would be particularly useful in these cases.\n\n3. In section 4.3 you say that MoCov2 is used both for poison generation and evaluation. Could you please elaborate? Also, what does Framework mean in Table 4?\n\n4. I am not sure I understand the result in Fig. 3, panel C. Is there an explanation for the model performing better when trained on perturbed data? Why only in this case?\n\n5. What is the computational cost of the proposed strategies? A comment on the computational costs should be added to the main text.\n\nComments:\n\n1. Captions could be expanded to include experimental details (what model is attacked, using which dataset, etc) and explain the acronyms.\n\n2. The tables show results for supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised algorithms. Shouldn\u2019t SimSiam and SimCLR be grouped together in the tables?\n\n3. I would suggest using an acronym for the proposed method instead of calling it \u2018ours\u2019.\n\n4. It would be interesting to have the perturbed images displayed alongside their clean versions."
