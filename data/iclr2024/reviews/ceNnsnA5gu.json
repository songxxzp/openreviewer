As such, the paper does not bring any new conceptual contribution into the picture. Theoretically speaking, all results in the paper are simple exercises. \n\nThe authors also show a poor understanding of the related literature. A concrete example is when they mention that WL has the same expressive power than *guarded* FO_2^\\cnt. This is simply not true, and it is not what Cai et al have proved. They have shown that the distinguishing expressive power of WL is exactly the same as FO_2^\\cnt (the guarded version is, in fact, weaker). The results by Barcel\u00f3 et al do not concern this notion of expressive power, but a different one. They show that each guarded FO_2^\\cnt unary formula can be turned into an equivalent GNN over the set of all graphs. That is, the result by Barcel\u00f3 et al is *uniform*, while the one by Cai et al. is not (and neither is the result of Morris et al.)"

Then the authors show that WL trees are equivalent to the 1-WL algorithm in terms of node coloring. They also propose an algorithm to identify subgraphs anchored at nodes which have the same node representations corresponding to a given WL tree. The contributions claimed by the authors are that the proposed WL trees can provide a more intuitive understanding of graph structures learned by message-passing GNNs."

In Equation 3, an anchored subgraph is defined in terms of a set of walks but Equation (5) defines an anchored subgraph as a set of pairs of nodes and walks. Further, the definition of $\\dot{\\cup}$ is not clearly presented. Also, why $dist(i,j)$ is only less than $\\ell$ but $dist(i,k)$ is less than or equal to $\\ell$?\n\n- Page 4: For the function id(\u00b7) that maps a tree node to a node in an anchored graph, since a node in an anchored graph may appear multiple times in the tree, is it still a function?\n\n[W2] The proposed WL-trees differ from the computational tree structures of message-passing GNNs mainly in disallowing the revisit of the parent nodes. The authors claim that the proposed WL-trees are equivalent to the 1-WL algorithm in terms of node coloring. This does not seem correct. Consider a counter-example, where G is a graph consisting of two triangles and H is a cycle of length 6. These two graphs cannot be distinguished by 1-WL, but would have different WL-trees proposed in the paper.\n\n[W3] The tree structures underlying message-passing GNNs and their connection to 1-WL have been well studied in the literature. It is unclear why the proposed WL-trees can provide a more fine-level analysis of the expressiveness of node representations learned by message-passing GNNs. In particular, the proposed WL-trees are not equivalent to 1-WL (see the above point [2]).\n\n[W4] In what kinds of scenarios will the proposed algorithm 1 be useful?\n\n[W5] For the section 6, what are the justifications for selecting CLIP and Nested GNN? There are a large number of GNN models developed in the literature. I don't see why these two particular GNN models are selected for analysis. \n\n[W6] Theorem 12 and Theorem 13 look confusing. Why is max used in Equation 8? Is the notation $G(j,h)$ defined? Also, the expressive power of Nested GNN goes beyond 1-WL, but the WL-trees proposed in the paper are claimed to be equivalent to 1-WL. So why does Theorem 13 state that there is a bijective mapping between WL-trees and their node embeddings calculated by Equation 10?\n\n[W7] For the statement \"A smaller count or conditional entropy means that the WL-tree can better identify a node\u2019s surround structure\", is any theoretical justification? Analysing GNN models using average counts of anchored subgraphs and the conditional entropy of anchored graphs look ad hoc."

It is known that message passing GNN, such as GIN, are capturing the rooted subtree around each node, which is exactly the structure captured by 1-WL, as shown in Figure 1 of [1]. As defined in Section 4, the WL-tree proposed in this paper is also such a rooted subtree. The only difference is that the rooted tree in this paper does not include the parent of a node as its child. It is not clear to me why this difference is important and how it brings significant differences compared to existing understanding. (Please correct me if I am understanding wrongly or incompletely.)\n\n2. Also, it is unclear what advantages or new understandings can be inspired by this new concept. Could you summarize what findings we can get from this new analysis tool?\n\n3. The experiments only show a simple analysis of two existing GNN models. What new model designs this new concept can lead to? This is not obvious from the reading. I think the experimental section can include deeper analyses or include a model inspired by the introduced WL-tree tool.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Xu, Keyulu, et al. \"How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2018."
