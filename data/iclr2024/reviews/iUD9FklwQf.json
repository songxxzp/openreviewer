Empirical evaluation using G4SATBench indicate GNNs excel at greedy local search strategies but struggle with backtracking search in latent spaces."

I appreciate the large amount of experiments (consuming 8,000 GPU hours) and data the author put effort to in studying GNN for SAT. \n3. The way of comparing the training and solving processes of GNNs with both CDCL and local search in SAT solvers is interesting to me."

However, industrial-level SAT formulas and formulas in SAT competitions can easily have thousands or even millions of variables. In order to make GNN-for-SAT approach practically applicable, the benchmarks using in the evaluation should also consider real-world level cases, such as large SAT formulas. I would encourage the authors to include such cases in G4SATBench. \n\n2. GNN models evaluated in the study only contains basic ones, including NeuroSAT (the first GNN-for-SAT model), GCN, GGNN, and GIN. It would be interesting to compare GNN models applied by recent GNN-for-SAT approaches, and see how they perform in G4SATBench,  instead of only considering basic GNN models. \n\n3. For experiments comparing with CDCL heuristics, the authors apply contrastive pretraining to pretrain the representation of CNF formulas to be close to their augmented ones with learned clauses. I have some doubts on the experimental setup. The learned clauses are not static and can vary depending on which CDCL solver we use. Studying whether GNN can learn these learned clauses is not quite reasonable to study if CNN can mimic CDCL. Furthermore, even though GNN can infer a bunch of learned clauses, can we say that CNN can learn a solving strategy akin to CDCL? As we know that CDCL not only involves clause learning, but also variable branching, etc."

As described in this submission, the G4SATBench benchmark consists of 3 instance families, including random instances, pseudo-industrial instances, and combinatorial instances. However, SAT is so fascinating because of its great importance in real-world industrial applications. As a top-tier conference submission that focuses on proposing a SAT benchmark, it is needed to include industrial SAT instances. Hence, the lack of industrial SAT instances degrades the significance of this work.\n\n2. It seems that the technical merit of this work is a bit thin. This paper describes a SAT benchmark, rather proposing new SAT solving techniques. Also, the authors claim that an insight obtained from this paper is that GNN models can effectively learn a simple greedy local search strategy (such as GSAT algorithm), but it is difficult to learn backtracking search strategy (such as DPLL and CDCL). Since it is well-known that, for solving application SAT instances, CDCL-based SAT solvers greatly outperform local search SAT solvers. The insight of this work seems to argue that GNN-based SAT solvers are not promising to solve application SAT instances, which also degrades the significance of this work."
