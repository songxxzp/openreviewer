However, this is not a valid benchmark, since the force field methods are supposed to predict forces on physically plausible molecules whereas the diffusion process that the authors have designed makes no guarantees about the plausibility of the molecules. This experiment can be reframed to show a weakness of the proposed method, in which unphysical starting points still become \"stable\", which should not be the case.\n- Similar to the criticism above, I don't believe that the time step prediction performance as reported in section 4.1 is relevant as independent Gaussian noise on the atoms is somewhat easier to predict than stable vs unstable molecules. Since QM7-X contains unstable structures as well, a better approach would be to see the correlation between the time step predictions of the network versus the ground truth RMSDs.\n- The test runs should be done with a few different random seeds so that we see how much of a discrepancy exists between runs for this method, as it is statistical in nature."

That is, once you add some noise to some training structure $y_i = x_i + \\epsilon$, then you might have the issue that for some $j \\neq i$, $||y_i - x_i|| > ||y_i - x_j||$. Is this a problem? \n- For table 1, there are many methods that generate molecules on QM9, why not report some of those results as well?\n\nCitations\n\n[1] Alex Nichol and Prafulla Dhariwal.

                "value": "- **Regarding the evaluation settings**: As stated in Section 4.2, the authors use the QM7-X dataset to evaluate the molecule relaxation performance. The unstable molecules in this dataset were generated by sampling from the Boltzmann distribution of the stable molecules. The confidence of such data generation procedure is in doubt: (1) In real-world applications, given a molecule, we usually use either random conformation sampling or cheap conformation optimization (e.g., empirical MMFF) to obtain initial molecular structures. The authors should further clarify whether these generated unstable molecules in QM7-X match the real-world settings. (2) Beyond the small organic molecules, molecular relaxation is widely used to investigate the equilibrium state of molecular systems like the adsorbate-catalyst complex or protein-ligand complex. There exist large-scale benchmarks that are more related to real-world settings like Open Catalyst Project (IS2RE and IS2RS tasks). It would be more convincing to verify the proposed methods on these challenging tasks.\n- **Regarding the generality of the proposed methods**: As a general framework, the proposed MoreRed can use different equivariant backbone models. Given the rich literature of equivariant networks, it would be more convincing to verify the generality of MoreRed with different architectures.\n- **Regarding the compared baselines**: For molecule relaxation tasks, the authors only compare the proposed three variants of MoreRed with corresponding NN-based Force Field models on the RMSD metric. For the machine learning based molecule relaxation approaches, there indeed exists strong baselines like [1], and there also exists generative models capable of transforming one data distribution to another data distribution that also lie in the settings of the molecule relaxation tasks [2]. It would enhance the quality of this paper if the authors could provide further discussions and comparisons to these approaches.\n- **Regarding the quality of unconditional generation**: I do not quite grasp how the diffusion time step predictor improve the unconditional generation quality. Moreover, the experiments also lack strong and advanced baselines [3,4,5].\n\n[1] Lu, Shuqi, et al. \"Highly Accurate Quantum Chemical Property Prediction with Uni-Mol+.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.16982 (2023).\n\n[2] Su, X., Song, J., Meng, C., & Ermon, S.
