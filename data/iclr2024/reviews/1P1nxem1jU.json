What is the advantage of the proposed method in maintaining low-frequency information? The authors should also compare DP with SpCo[1] in the experiments.\n2. The proposed method looks not efficient enough. It seems that Algorithm 1 involves eigenvalue decomposition and Laplacian Matrix reconstruction, which are both expensive. A time analysis would make the proposal more convincing.\n3. The experiment currently lacks graphs with large node numbers such as ogbn-arxiv and ogbn-proteins[2]. \n4. Why is the improvement of the DP method over previous ones marginal in some cases in Tables 1 to 4?\n5. In Obs 4, proof to the proposition \"preserving key eigenvalues while modifying others enables the generation of augmented graphs that\nuphold foundational properties\"  is relatively insufficient, especially when the authors use the spectral variation defined only by a single previous work.\n6.

Though they are not invented for the same purpose, it is not hard to transfer the idea from [1] into the context of this paper.\n\nQ2. In section 3.2, many observations have been mentioned by existing works. For example, **Obs 2. Low-frequency components display greater resilience to edge alterations** has been mentioned in existing work [2]. **Obs 4. Specific low-frequency eigenvalues are\nclosely tied to crucial graph properties.**, as this paper mentioned in Section 4.3, has been studied thoroughly by Chung in the spectral graph theory [3].\n\nQ3. The proposed Algorithm 1 first decomposes the graph Laplacian L,  perturbs the high-frequency part (larger eigenvalues of L), and finally reconstructs the perturbed adjacency matrix. I think a simpler version is directly decomposing the adjacency matrix A and perturbing its (A's) small eigenvalues. From this perspective, it is similar to many classic low-rank approximation-based works on graphs.\n\nQ4. The performance in the supervised setting is good, which is shown in Table 1. However, its performance in unsupervised learning (Table 3) and transfer learning settings (Table 4) is average.\n\nQ5. A suggestion for this paper is to finish experiments in Tables 1,2, and 3, where now they are shown '-'. Ideally, if the experiments are not conducted in existing papers, authors should implement the baseline methods and report the results in those missing setting by themselves.\n\n[1] Lin, Lu, Jinghui Chen, and Hongning Wang. \"Spectral Augmentation for Self-Supervised Learning on Graphs.\" In The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations. 2023.\n\n[2] Wang, Haonan, Jieyu Zhang, Qi Zhu, and Wei Huang. \"Augmentation-free graph contrastive learning with performance guarantee.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2204.04874 (2022).\n\n[3] https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~fan/mypaps/fanpap/111diameters.pdf"
