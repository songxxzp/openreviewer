Axis should be labeled, error bars should be defined. \n\nIt would also be useful to spell out the number of features and training used in each case. Does the order in Fig. 2 reflect the number of features or the amount of training in each modality or the successes of the neural network models in each modality? \n\nThe features are correlated and therefore it is hard to deduce anything from the fitting analyses. For example, if there is a ball in the image, and the text says ball and the audio says ball, then one can find that language areas can be fit by \"visual\" features but this does not mean that the language areas represent visual features. Conversely, visual areas can be fit by text, not because visual areas represent text. To understand the relationship between different modalities, we need rigorous controlled experiments that can prove uncorrelated feature dimensions. Unfortunately, this problem is ubiquitous throughout the paper. \n\nThere are no comparisons with different baselines, different neural network models, ablation studies."

In the best case scenario, the caption to speech is perfect and the information is redundant. In the worst case scenario, the speech is a bad rendering of the caption and merely adds noise. \n\nIt would be useful to conduct experiments where there is only visual information that is dissociated from audio information and from language information, experiments with only language information, etc. Even better, one could run experiments where different modalities are orthogonalized (e.g. show a ball and present the word chair). Once the modalities are rigorously decorrelated, it may be possible to begin to disentangle the contribution of different modalities to brain signals."

Key findings indicate that the visual system primarily focuses on converting visual input into semantic descriptions, and multimodal alignment enhances the prediction of brain activity compared to unimodal approaches."

The main message from the results, namely, visual perception carries semantic information that can be predicted with semantic-based encoding model, is well known and demonstrated across modalities and with different models. \n\nGiven the above, it is not surprising to me that other modality that are not present in the stimuli could individually predict brain responses to some extend (and that they each perform worse than the visual model), since the extracted feature from these modalities all share the semantic information contained in the visual feature and in the brain. It is also not surprising that, with the ImageBind model each modality gains a small boost in performance because of more semantic information they gain from the visual modality.\n\nSince the authors didn\u2019t make comparison between imageBind models to other single or multi- modal models, it is unclear whether ImageBind help at all in terms of overall brain prediction. \n\nThroughout the paper, comparison of models are largely limited to univariate bar plots or contrasts plots in brain maps. Without analysis like variance partitioning or feature regression between model space it is unclear whether these models from different modalities indeed predicts any regions uniquely.\n\nImageBind as a useful tool to bridge across modalities, perhaps has more potentials in aiding our understanding of the brain with stimuli that actually consists of multiple modalities (movies with actual audios). With those one could study, for example, difference of subtitles vs video transcripts encoding in the brain with presence of visual input."
