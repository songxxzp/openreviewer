The assumptions and limitations of the method are much better discussed and the changes in the experiments have improved them. That said, I fully concur with reviewer s6a3 that discussion on sufficient statistics with which the theory holds should still be included. I will update my score to 6.\nPOST REBUTTAL UPDATE END\n\nThe paper considers front-door adjustment for causal effect estimation. In particular, the setup involves the following variables: T (treatment), W (observed confounders), U (unobserved confounders), Y the outcome, Z (front-door adjustment variable), and X proxy variable for Z. The article makes two main contributions: 1) The article proposes a conditional front-door adjustment, which differs from the standard front-door adjustment by having an additional edge from the observed confounders W to the front-door adjustment variable Z. The paper shows how in this situation the standard front-door adjustment must be modified to estimate the causal effect (Theorem 3). The proof is based on the assumption that the front-door adjustment variable Z is observed. 2) The second contribution is a conditional VAE method for the situation where the front-door adjustment variable Z is not observed, to estimate it from the proxies X (conditionally on variables W and T)."

To the best of my knowledge this is novel (though I haven\u2019t read all the papers about front-door adjustment). The conditional front-door adjustment is presented clearly and the proof seems mathematically correct.\n\n2) The VAE approach seems a reasonable attempt to estimate the front-door adjustment variable from the proxies.\n\n3) The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach clearly outperforms methods that do not do any front-door adjustment at all. Sensitivity analysis for assuming an incorrect number of latent variables (smaller than correct) was a nice bonus."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) There seems to be a gap in the theoretical part. The model identifiability analysis in Section 4.3 shows that the front-door adjustment variable Z obtained with VAE is identifiable up to a transformation (more or less the result from Khemakhem, 2020). But Theorem 3 is based on the assumption that the front-door adjustment variable Z is observed. It is not clear if Theorem 3 is still applicable if it is used for a transformed Z.\n\n2) The empirical comparison includes as baselines only methods that do not use the proxies of the front-door variable at all, and consequently each of those has poor performance. It would be better to think how the proxies would be used if the new method did not exist, for example by using the proxies directly for front-door adjustment? The existing front-door adjustment methods (by Jeong, Wienobst) were not included in the comparison because they assumed that the DAG is known. However, also the present method assumes that the causal graph is the one presented in Figure 2 and all simulations assume this correct structure (except for a possible mismatch in the latent dimension).\n\n3) Some small inconsistencies in the notation, at least: Equation (4): LHS has T and W but RHS does not. Equation (6): formulas for the mean and variance have j on the LHS but not on the RHS.\n\n4) In the real-world example, the ATE estimate is 0.176, which is very similar to the previous estimate 0.175 (from Appendix C.5), which seems to imply that the new method does not provide too much novel insight in this case (but of course it is a good demonstration that it is consistent with previous estimates). In general, it would be nice to see some example where the heavy VAE machinery is really needed, which might require more complex, e.g., higher-dimensional, proxies, to make a convincing case.\n\nOverall, I liked the first contribution, the conditional front-door adjustment, but I found the conditional VAE a bit confusing, possibly breaking the theory, and whose usefulness was not demonstrated very convincingly. I\u2019m not sure but that paper might have been stronger without the VAE aspect altogether. At the very least the possible gap in the theory should be addressed. If it is not possible to fix the gap, then the theory (regarding the identifiability of the VAE) could be moved to the supplement and replaced by more convincing empirical analysis, and the text could be updated accordingly."

Tchetgen Tchetgen. \"Identifying causal effects with proxy variables of an unmeasured confounder.\" Biometrika 105.4 (2018): 987-993.\n\nIn fact, the current theory is only meaningful under small proxy noise that is \\epsilon in eq10.  If we examine the identifiability of iVAE closely, we see, as in eq25 in the current paper, only $f^{-1}(X)$ is identified (up to deterministic transformation) but not the latent variable. And, $f^{-1}(X)=f^{-1}(f(Z)+\\epsilon) \\neq Z$ if $\\epsilon \\neq 0$. See the Questions for more related points.\n\nHowever, if $\\epsilon = 0$, then X and Z are related by an injective function, and it is not very meaningful to say X is a proxy of Z, because the whole point of proxy setting is that there is *unmeasured* information of Z not captured in X.\n\nI do not require to fix this weakness in the rebuttal, but it should be discussed and made explicit in the revised version.\n\n*Separated, limited, and unclear outcome estimation*\n\nThe connection between the front-door setting and the proposed VAE is weakened, because the outcome is not modeled by the VAE, and the outcome estimation is done in a standalone step, as in Sec 5. Importantly, how does the 2-step process here implement the adjustment eq3? How exactly the ATE is computed? Moreover, the adjustment and outcome variables follow linear models; this might not be an inherent limitation in the approach, but this limitation in the current work should be mentioned in the Conclusion. Finally, for such an important component of the approach, citing a web article makes me nervous, please find and cite an original reference (a research paper).\n\n*Experiments are not sufficient or clear.*\n\nThe major problem is that there are no comparisons to methods designed for the front-door setting. And this renders the good result in Fig 4 not very meaningful. I cannot see why we need to exclude FINDFDSET and LISTFDSETS because they require a known DAG; when you build the synthetic dataset, the DAG is known anyway? And I doubt there are no other methods for the FDA. If you really cannot fix this weakness, it is necessary to mention this in the Conclusion.\n\nAnother important issue is that, as in Table 1, the proposed method requires a huge amount of data to perform well. In previous work, the methods usually train on sample size < 1k, but the proposed method is worse than other methods when sample size < 1k. This should be examined seriously and would be a major weakness of the approach if this is a general observation. \n\nThe experiment on Adult is very confusing to me. First, the \u201cproxy\u201d X also affects Y as shown in the Appendix, can we still say this is a \u201cproxy\u201d? In particular, is the process in Sec 5 still applicable? Second, a reader cannot understand the discussion of direct and indirect causal effects without looking into the Appendix. You need to mention X (eg., marital status) also affects Y and is the \u201cmediator\u201d here. Third, it seems to me that \u201csignificant indirect discrimination \u2026 through the indirect paths via marital status\u201d and \u201csignificant discrimination against sex through the stereotype\u201d are contradictory but not consistent?\n\n*I will read the rebuttal and revised paper and raise my score to 6 if the issues/questions in Weaknesses are addressed.

It is better to add experiments in this regard.\n\n*An important reference is missing*. Intact-VAE [1] is also based on iVAE and it is more related to the proposed VAE than any other compared methods, although it considers a different causal setting. In fact, many points mentioned in this review are discussed in [1], e.g., the noise level, the form of the identifiability, and the representation dim. And it is good to add experimental comparison.\n\n[1] Wu, Pengzhou Abel, and Kenji Fukumizu. \"beta-Intact-VAE: Identifying and Estimating Causal Effects under Limited Overlap.\" International Conference on Learning Representations (2022).\n\nI believe only the link W \u2192 Z is necessary but not W\u2192T and W\u2192Y. In fact, the Adult dataset does not have W\u2192T.\n\nIt should be made clearer in Contributions and Conclusion that it is the FDA, which is a well-established result, that deals with unobserved confounding in this approach, and the VAE learns the adjustment variable but does not do the adjustment using eq3.

The second relaxation is allowing unmeasured confounding variables between treatment and outcome. A background on the front- and back-door criteria is given after which the authors proceed to state the first contribution of the paper, the Conditional Front-Door adjustment (CFD). The CFD is the same formula as the standard front-door adjustment but with additional conditioning on W (the backdoor paths between the treatment and the mediator). Subsequently, the second contribution of the paper, the CFDiVAE model, is described. It follows existing generative VAE work (such as (Louizos et al.)) and adjusts it to the assumed generative model of CFD. CFDiVAE learns a representation of the mediator, given observed back-door paths (confounding variables) between the treatment and the mediator, and allowing for potential unobserved confounding variables. A thorough analysis of model indentifiability is provided. The paper concludes with a series of experiments. First, estimation bias of ATE is compared to competing causal-VAE methods. CFDiVAE beats the other methods for large enough dataset sizes. Secondly, a short assessment of CFDiVAE on a real dataset is performed."

The methods the paper builds on (front-door criterion) are useful in many areas, from model interpretability to algorithmic fairness. The first contribution (CFD) is a correct relaxation of the front-door criterion, while the second one (CFDiVAE), while building on existing VAE methods, is well analyzed. . The experiments show that, assuming a linear generative model with a mediator, CFDiVAE estimates ATE better than methods that do not model a mediator directly."

                "value": "The main weakness of the paper is its limited novelty.\n\nThe main contribution, the Conditional Front-Door Adjustment is a straightforward extension of the front-door criterion (where everything is conditioned on the backdoor path W between the treatment and the mediator; W is assumed to be observed). It, in fact, boils down to plugging in the front door criterion into the backdoor criterion.\n\nOne could argue that any concrete DAG which allows for the relaxation of the front door criterion with the do calculus (as mentioned in Pearl, Causality, 2009, page 83, Figure 3.1) can form a basis for a similar model.\n\nThe second contribution, the CFDiVAE generative model, builds heavily on similar models present in literature. The generative and inference part follow standard VAE procedures adjusted to the assumed underlying SEM.\n\nWhile the specific combination of CFD with a generative VAE-based model is novel, it also does seem incremental."
