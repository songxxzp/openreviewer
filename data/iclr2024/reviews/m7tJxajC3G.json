That is, the paper assumes different but related structural causal models at each client and seeks to discover the global structural causal model where local differences are modeled using domain-specific effective parameters for each variable and a set of domain-specific the pseudo-confounders. The paper proposes to use the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion and a (federated) independent change principle, based on the partial cross-covariance operator on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which captures non-linearities in the relationship of variables based on the chosen kernel. To make computations tractable, it approximates the kernel with random Fourier features. It shows that these criteria can be computed from summary statistics based on the kernel matrices."

Isn't that a problematic assumption, or did I misread the proof of Thm. 4?\n- How does sharing local kernel matrices affect privacy?\n\n**Detailed Comments:**\n- The notation with bold $\\mathbf{\\psi}$ and normal $\\psi$ is visually hard to distinguish.\n- The formulation with an underlying causal graph and an augmented causal graph is not clear to me. For me it made sense to either assume an underlying \"augmented\" graph that captures local differences, or to assume an underlying graph and local interventions - these interventions are then modeled via the augmented graph. If the latter is the case, this should be clarified.\n- Is it necessary to consider $\\mho$ an observable variable? In the experiments, some additional information is used to decide the domain, but in general this is rarely possible. E.g., in [1] the domain is infered. What happens if you assumed that every client has a different domain and $\\mho$ is the client index? \n\n\n[1] Mian, Osman, Michael Kamp, and Jilles Vreeken. \"Information-theoretic causal discovery and intervention detection over multiple environments.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI-23. 2023."
