There may be some noises or guided exploration functions for policy learning as in TD3 and SAC. These operations will not make actions far from the current policy.\n4.\tWhy DDQS works? It seems that DDQS will select the actions that have the high values of $Q^{max}(s,a)$ and $Q^{min}(s,a)$. Why DDQS is better than other definitions based on $Q^{max}(s,a)$ and $Q^{min}(s,a)$, such as $\\sum_{a}(Q^{max}(s,a)$+ $Q^{min}(s,a))/ \\sum_{a}Q^{max}(s,a)$."

The method replaces the conventional blind action perturbation and exclusive policy with a Q-value-guided exploration scheme. The intuition is that a well-learned Q function could guide out-of-distribution exploration beyond the current policy. The method is instantiated under the double-Q framework. The major difference between the proposed method and the conventional double Q learning is in the exploration policy. In this work, the exploration policy distribution is estimated using the exponential of the maximum of Q functions. Experiments conducted on simulated continuous control tasks show slightly better performance of BACC than the baselines."

                "value": "1. The paper is difficult to follow especially when reading Section 4. I actually cannot understand how all the introduced components fit together into the proposed method until reading Algorithm 1. I think it would be better to explicitly state how the DDQS operator is instantiated in Sec 4.2 and 4.3 for the readers to understand the method more easily. Also, I am still confused about why the objectives for Q and $\\pi$ learning are induced using the conservative policy $\\pi_O$; it does not match the implementation where the transitions are obtained using the exploration policy distribution $\\pi_E$.    \n2. The experimented tasks are general RL testbeds, which may not be the best fit to verify the exploration ability of different methods. I would recommend that the authors experiment on sparse-reward control tasks, such as ``FetchPush'' from OpenAI Gym robotics suite.\n3. The related literature of this paper is not sufficiently discussed. In the related work (Sec 4.5), many general-purpose exploration methods (not designed for specific RL algorithms) such as exploration with intrinsic motivation [1][2], exploration with randomized networks [3][4], explicitly separating out exploration [5] are not thoroughly discussed. \n\n[1] Machado, Marlos C., Marc G. Bellemare, and Michael Bowling. \"Count-based exploration with the successor representation.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Vol. 34. No. 04. 2020.\n\n[2] Pathak, Deepak, Dhiraj Gandhi, and Abhinav Gupta. \"Self-supervised exploration via disagreement.\" International conference on machine learning.

The BACC algorithm is similar to the ``hybrid actor-critic exploration'' technique in AW-OPT[6], although it is motivated from a more practical aspect. I recommend the authors compare with or at least discuss this related technique. \n\n[6] Lu, Yao, et al. \"Aw-opt: Learning robotic skills with imitation and reinforcement at scale.\" Conference on Robot Learning. PMLR, 2022.\n\n5. The empirical results seem not significant. In Fig. 3, the performance of BACC is close to the baselines except in ``Humanoid-v2''. In Fig. 5(a), the average performance of BACC is better but the big variance of the baseline OAC covers the confidence range of BACC, while in Fig. 5(b) BACC fails to gain advantage over SAC. It might be due to the benchmark tasks being too easy (dense reward, the learning agent could make progress even without proper exploration) and not favorable to methods with strong exploration abilities. Therefore, the authors are encouraged to investigate other tasks with stricter requirements for exploration."
