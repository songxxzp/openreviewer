However, CHRR do not reduce the model parameters at inference stage, because it still need to store the non-learnable label matrix for finding top-k most relevant labels, given the model-predicted output random circular vector. What's the model parameters used at inference time, compared to HRR and FC?\n\n2. At the inference stage, to compute similarity between the label matrix and the model predicted random circular vector, CHRR seems to involve more complex computations (Table 1) that is non-standard euclidean distance metric. This suggests CHRR can not enjoy the advantage of fast/approximate nearest neighbor search methods that reduces the inference time complexity from `O(L)` to `O(log(L))` where `L` is the number of labels. On the other hand, HRR can actually leverage ANN search methods at the inference stage. Any analysis on the inference time complexity and the actually inference latency? \n\n3. The experiment results are not very comprehensive:\n(1) There should be a table comparing the model size at training/inference stage, and the detail hyper-parameters such as `h` and `d`.\n(2) Compared to the FC baseline, It is not clear whether the performance gain of CHRR is from larger model size (including the non-learnable label matrix). \n(3) The proposed method did not compare with more advanced XMC methods, such as Transformer-based encoders."

                "value": "This paper is about improving the representative power of embeddings in Extreme Multi-label Learning (XML) with ideas from Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR). Typical XML approaches, which leverage a large linear classifier layer to map an input to a label set, have limitations: the linearity constraint restricts the modelling power while the enormous number of classifiers blow-up the time and space complexities. Several approaches have been proposed to mitigate the complexity issues, e.g. tree-search based and negative label mining based approaches. This paper alternatively proposes to use HRRs which learn classifiers in the Fourier-transformed space instead of the original linear embedding space, thus resulting in more powerful, non-linear classifier learning. The proposed approach also brings down the training complexity by leveraging loss functions that depend only on the positive labels (which are typically sparse).\n\nThe paper largely exploits the key ideas from earlier papers [HRR in Plate '95, HRR for XML in Ganesan et.al. '21]. In addition, it generalizes  [Ganesan et.al.'21] through Complex-valued HRR representations. Experiments demonstrate that, keeping other factors constant, the accuracy with CHRR > HRR > naive fully connected XML classifier layer."
