                "value": "This paper focuses on the problem of training an accurate unbiased model using a dataset with multiple biases. Conventional training methods (e.g. ERM) lead to undesirable shortcuts in the model due to the spurious correlations in the dataset. To counter this, debiased training algorithms have been proposed but most of them focus on a single bias at a time. Hence, this work focuses on the problem of multiple biases in a dataset, which is more practical. They first divide the dataset into multiple groups such that each group exerts the same bias on model training, using labeled bias attributes. They formulate the problem in terms of multi-task learning (MTL) where the model has to learn to handle each group correctly. Towards this, they derive a multi-objective optimization algorithm to dynamically update task weights so that model parameters can converge to a Pareto-stationary point. For experiments, they re-purpose the CelebA dataset (called MultiCelebA) using multiple attributes that are spuriously correlated with the target class. On MultiCelebA and other benchmarks, they achieve state-of-the-art performance for both multiple bias and single bias settings."

                "value": "* Debiased training as MTL\n    * Debiased training actually seems closer to multi-domain learning (MDL) [W1] rather than MTL. Because MTL clearly means learning different tasks (i.e. task labels are different) as the paper also mentions on Page 2. \n    * On the other hand, MDL involves the same target classes but data coming from different domains, and the goal is to achieve good performance on all domains simultaneously.\n    * Also it seems like debiased training has a lot in common with long-tailed learning [W2]. For example, upweighting and upsampling baselines are also employed in long-tailed learning.\n    * Overall, I wonder why MTL is chosen over these other two. Also, it might be interesting to see how more advanced techniques from MDL or long-tailed learning perform when adapted to debiased training.\n    * Note: the above two references are just examples, there are many more papers in both sub-topics.\n\n* Regarding dataset contribution\n    * It is unclear how MultiCelebA is a new dataset compared to CelebA. There are no new images or new labels. Even the choice of attributes is based on the analysis from a prior work. \n    * The contribution of a new dataset seems misleading, only a new experimental setting based on an existing dataset is proposed.\n\n* Design choices\n    * The design choices for the main algorithm are not well explained. Please see questions for more details.\n\n* Practicality and significance of dataset\n    * Simple methods like upsampling and upweighting give very good improvements over the ERM baseline and are quite close to even the proposed method (Table 1). This raises a question on whether the proposed MultiCelebA is practical or challenging enough to provide new insights into evaluating debiased training methods.\n    * See questions for more details.\n\n### References\n\n[W1] Sebag et al., \"Multi-Domain Adversarial Learning\", ICLR19\n\n[W2] Cao et al., \u201cLearning Imbalanced Datasets with Label-Distribution-Aware Margin Loss\u201d, NeurIPS19"

While the overall accuracy numbers of MultiCelebA seem lower than UrbanCars (but similar to Multi-Color MNIST), upsampling and upweighting are consistently good on all three datasets. \n    * So MultiCelebA seems similar in terms of difficulty compared to existing datasets (i.e. there seems to be no advantage to having real images over synthetic images in the other datasets).\n    * Another question is whether complicated debiased training methods (like the proposed method) themselves provide any significant improvements to be deemed of practical significance. This is because we observe a similar trend where upsampling and upweighting perform very well compared to all the supervised debiased learning methods.\n\n* Regarding design choices (Algorithm 1)\n    1. Why is $\\theta$ updated again (outside the \"for loop\") after updating it for $U$ number of times?\n    2. Why do $\\bar{\\alpha}$ and $\\lambda$ need to be updated once every $U$ iterations and not every iteration?\n    3. Also, why not have $\\bar{\\alpha}$ and $\\lambda$ updates be at different frequencies like every $U_1$ and every $U_2$ iterations instead of together after $U$ iterations?\n    * These design choices need to be explained and justified since this is the core idea being proposed.\n\n* Minor comments\n    * Page 3 (5th line of \u201cFairness with MTL\u201d paragraph): use \\cite instead of \\citet\n    * Sec. 3.1 (first paragraph): mention dimensions of $\\theta$, should be $\\mathbb{R}^n$ as per usage in Definition 2.\n    * Fig. 3: x-axis title has typos: \u201cinteration\u201d \u2192 \u201citeration\u201d.\n    * Page 10: Citation for Fernando et al.

The major issue with the approach is knowing so many different subgroups a priori. In a more challenging setting, it is almost impossible to know all possible different subgroups beforehand to design the training strategy. I would like see an experiment where out of 3 subgroups the authors include two in their training, leaving one unidentified and how their method performs.\n\n5. There is a recent notion of difficulty in shortcuts. For example, some shortcuts are easy to learn, and some are difficult to learn. If the authors are using different subgroups to design multitask losses, the losses should be weighted corresponding to the shorcut difficulty. For example, a hard shortcut loss will be penalized less than an easy shortcut loss, as the mode is more prone to latching on the easy shotcut. The paper on shortcut difficulty is as follows:\nBeyond Distribution Shift: Spurious Features Through the Lens of Training Dynamics. Murali et al. TMLR 2023.\n\nThis setting will be more realistic.\n\n6. The dataset MultiCelebA is good for evaluation, but I would like to see a more realistic dataset like NIH-chesttube in the shortcut paper in #5.\n\n7. Also, with multiple groups involved in the multitask loss, the overall performance may drop.\n\n8. This is related to #4. All the possible groups may not be a shortcut. In this regard, can the shortcut discovery be aligned with the notion of slice discovery (ex DOMINO) to detect if really a spurious correlation going on before applying their method? This is a nice-to-have comment. I request the authors to think about this as a future work.\n\n\n**Post rebuttal**\n\nThanks for the response. I agree about point 5 and 6 but request the authors to think about it. I would like to thank the authors for  considering the point 4 and would like to give a score of 7.

Rigorous definitions of spurious correlations and the conditions under which they are fully eliminated would benefit readers.\n\n2. The MultiCelebA dataset appears inadequate in distinguishing between spurious and non-spurious correlations. The authors have not elaborated on the dataset's construction, even in supplementary materials. Furthermore, while they label certain correlations between target attributes and specific attributes as spurious, the these correlations seem to compose of the spurious and non-spurious ones.  An isolated evaluation of spurious correlations is essential for gauging the efficacy of methods designed to counteract them. Thus, relying on experiments with the MultiCelebA dataset might be questionable.\n\n3. Tables 2-4 present diverse evaluation metrics, raising concerns about potential cherry-picking to favor the proposed method. Without including metrics both UNBIASED and WORST consistently, the experiments might come off as biased and not entirely objective.\n\n4. The credibility of evaluating spurious correlations using the MultiCelebA dataset is questionable, as mentioned above. While results derived from Multi-Color MNIST might be more reliable, the proposed method's minimum group-wise accuracy is lower than that of GroupDRO. This undermines the claim that the proposed method is superior to GroupDRO."

                "value": "This work addresses the problem of avoiding that models use _several_ biases (or spurious correlations) from the data to perform predictions, whereas previous work has focused in avoiding a _single_ bias. To this end, the authors relate the problem of debiasing a model with multitask learning (MTL) and proposed to group the dataset into different groups/tasks based on their proposed grouping criteria. Then, they propose to train the MTL model by introducing learnable convex task weights that are regularized to reduce the norm of the loss gradient. Finally, the authors introduce a dataset based on CelebA that contains multiple biases, and use it to compare their proposed approach with a number of previous methods. Moreover, the authors also compare their method in different single-bias experiments and ablate the different components of the proposed solution."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- W1. While MultiCelebA is interesting and useful, selling it as a \"new dataset\" is too much of a stretch for my taste.\n- W2. Saying that this is the first work connecting \"unbiasing\" with MOO or MTL (which is quite freely interpreted) is arguable at best. First, one could argue that even importance-weighting approaches are already interpreting the problem as MOO, but there are even works such as FairGrad [4] that connect biases (this one, in the context of fairness, which does not necessarily imply data-imbalance) which adaptively scale gradients.\n- W3. Statements about MOO and Pareto Optimality in the manuscript makes me worry about whether the authors have fully understood these concepts. For example:\n  - I don't understand what it means to \"address spurious correlations based on a theory of MOO\".\n  - \"Finding _the_ Pareto-optimal parameter\". There are _many_ Pareto-optimal parameters.\n  - The goal is that \"performance should not be biased towards a certain group\". Pareto-optimality does not guarantee this. Indeed, MGDA is known to be biased towards tasks with low magnitudes. The concept the authors refer to is known as \"task impartiality\" in MTL (see, e.g., [1, 2]).\n  - Saying that MoCo is the SotA of MOO is quite a stretch to say the least.\n- W4. The arguments towards \"finding a flat optima\" are rather hand-wavy and unconvincing.\n- W5. Related with W3, it is quite unclear to me what makes the proposed method work at all:\n  - MGDA minimizes in each iteration the regularizer in Eq. 3, and it is biased towards dominated tasks (which is observed in Table 5). However, the proposed approach (which is an interpolation between ERM and MGDA, similar to CAGrad [3]) works well. Is it the interpolation? Or learning $\\alpha$ using along the parameters?\n  - It is rather intriguing that the grouping policy does not work well on its own. In principle, I don't see why the grouping and the training approach should not be independent.\n- W6. Experiments lack statistics like standard deviations, making the effectiveness of some design choices (e.g. the update frequency $U$) quite unclear.\n- W7. The results in UrbanCars are quite different from those that can be found in other works. Just as an example, the worst variant of ERM recorded in [Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/out-of-distribution-generalization-on) has a gap of -15.4, while the one reported in the paper is of -69.2 (worse than any result of the PwC table). \n\n[1] Javaloy, A., & Valera, I.
