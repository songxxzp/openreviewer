I see that the paper compares the model performance with a score of 90, which \"according to IXL, is considered excellent for a mastered skill\", but it does not make sense to take a score of excellence as \"the performance of elementary students\", because it is an \"expert-level\" human performance.\n  - Where is the number 54.7% from?\n  - Besides, it doesn't seem fair to use Ph.D. students' test scores for the human evaluation of these elementary school questions.\n2. What is the reason of not experimenting on GPT-4? It would be beneficial to test it since its performance has largely increased compared to GPT-3.5"
