                "value": "The Thompson sampling (TS) method has been used in the healthcare community for achieving better bias-variance trade-off compared to conventional RL methods. However, in the healthcare area, each TS round usually involves one or more humans such that the trial is costly and incurs delayed effects of actions. To resolve this issue, this work proposed to capture the delayed effects of each action using a vector of delayed effect correction parameters and optimize them using batch Bayesian optimization (BO). Some tricks such as warm-starting are applied to TS for improving the performance. The proposed method is tested on a JITAI simulation environment."

                "value": "1. The novelty of the proposed method is limited. The proposed method is a straightforward application of conventional batch BO to optimize the delayed effects correction terms in TS. I didn't identify any novel technical issues or challenges for doing this. Also, the motivation for choosing batch BO is not clear. Since the relationship between the $v_a$ and $\\beta_a$ has been formulated (line 6 in Algorithm 1), why is a black-box optimization algorithm (i.e., BO) selected? Why not learn $\\beta_a$ directly using Bayesian inference, SGD, or any other optimization method? \n\n 2. I have serious concerns about the soundness of the experiments:\n\n- Firstly, the proposed method is not fairly compared with the baselines. Even though the results of DQN and REINFORCE are shown in Appendix A.2, the figures only include the learning curve of the baseline and don't show that of the proposed method. In the current presentation, I don't know how to achieve the conclusion that \"BOTS can achieve better\nperformance than these methods ...\". For example, in the first two graphs of Fig. 3, it seems that DQN can achieve a return larger than 2000 with only 100 episodes, which is better than many blue points in Fig. 1. I suggest the authors to re-organize the graphs such that the comparisons between different results can be straightforward.\n\n- Secondly, one key contribution of the proposed method is to optimize the delayed effects correction terms using BO. To demonstrate the priority of the proposed method, some simple baselines (such as the conventional TS, TS+Bayesian inference, TS+random search, etc.) can be considered. Without comparing with suitable baselines, it's hard to measure the significance of the proposed method.   \n\n- Besides, from the results shown in Figs. 1&2, it seems that batch BO doesn't work in the proposed method. In all the experiments, the reward increases almost linearly in the number of BO rounds, which are negative observations for supporting the usage of batch BO in this scenario and contradict to the motivation (i.e., execute TS trials in parallel) of this work.\n\n3. The writing of this paper needs to be improved. There are many undefined, inconsistent notations, and typos that make it hard to follow. For example, $x_s$ in Algorithm 1, $\\sigma_y\\ $, and $\\sigma_Y$ in Section 4.1 are not defined. Do $x_s$ and $s_t$ denote the same variable? The notation r is used to represent both the reward and the round index. Some examples of grammatical errors and typos are: \"... approach addresses the problem warm-starting the ...\", \"by for each action\", \"correspond return\", \"suing\", \"As the in the ...\", etc."

                "value": "1. At the end of Section 2.1, this paper mentioned that existing work requires a number of assumptions about the delayed effect process while this work doesn't rely on any assumption. However, representing the delayed effect using a constant term seems to be a strong assumption on the delayed effect process. Can you provide a detailed analysis of the implicit/explicit assumption used in this work? \n\n2. Why did you assume \"$\\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\beta_3$\" in the experiments? What's the problem of optimizing them separately?"
