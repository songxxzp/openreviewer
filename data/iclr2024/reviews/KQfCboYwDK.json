The paper creates specific settings for the experiments and makes some discussions, but are there many real-world scenarios in which such adiabatic assumptions can be applied? Also, there seems to require a more detailed formulation of such an adiabatic assumption. Say if the new information is too little, then it gets back to the ordinary training and there is no reason to do continual learning. Some mathematical formulation of the adiabatic assumption should be defined.\n\n2. In addition to the mathematical definition of the adiabatic assumption, it is also not clear why the selected settings in the experiments satisfy such an assumption. Why the tasks are chosen in such a way? From a more practical perspective, if we are dealing with real-world tasks, how do we check if the incoming task satisfy the adiabatic assumption and we can use the proposed method?\n\n3. The paper only tests for certain restricted settings and uses a relatively simple model (GMM). Though the paper mentions that there could be more advanced version of the GMM model that could solve the capacity problem, but there does not seem to be much evidence to support such a claim.\n\n4. It is claimed that the proposed method does not have the problem of scaling up as the number of tasks increases. However, for GMM, there is the number of clusters and I wonder should such a number be set according to the total number of tasks? If there are infinite number of classes coming in a stream, should the number of clusters also increase? Even though the change of size could be small, if we want to use a much more capable model as mentioned in the paper, will the model size go up as the tasks increase?\n\n\nMinor:\nPage 1: \"On the one hand, there are \u201dtrue\u201d replay\" (the quote symbols)"

This study takes a novel and promising approach to this problem by using GMMs, in an attempt to provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that it is possible to do better."

                "value": "**Issue 1: important comparisons are missing**\n\nI am afraid critical comparisons are missing for a convincing proof-of-principle demonstration that selective replay can provide substantial benefits. The paper compares AR (using GMMs) with DGR and ER (both using VAEs), and because AR performs better than DGR, the authors conclude that selective replay is beneficial. But I do not think that this can be concluded from this comparison. There are several important differences between AR and DGR \u2013 not only the use of selective replay, that could explain the difference in performance. Perhaps the authors would argue that DGR is a \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d technique, and that showing improved performance with a method using selective replay would be enough demonstration, but I do not agree with that. Firstly, it is not clear how DGR is implemented and it seems this is not done in an optimal way (see issues 2 and 3). Secondly, the performance obtained by DGR is simply not good (e.g., for MNIST it is substantially lower than a linear classifier could obtain). Improvements on top of that are thus not necessarily meaningful.\nI would like to encourage the authors to instead include a comparison that directly assesses the benefit of using selective replay over normal replay (e.g., AR against the exact same version but using normal replay).\n\n**Issue 2: relevant past work is not discussed (appropriately)**\n\nDiscussion of past literature is insufficient, and some important aspects are ignored. Firstly, it is claimed at several places that current replay methods must replay an amount of samples proportional to the number of past tasks, but Van de Ven et al. (2020) empirically showed that it is possible to do better than this because \u201cpreventing forgetting is easier than learning\u201d. Although to make this possible, it is important that the loss terms from the replayed data and the current data are balanced appropriately. (It is also unclear to me whether this is done in the current study when a limited amount of data is replayed with DGR and ER, see also the last question under issue 3 below.) Another paper that would be good to discuss is Klasson et al. (2023, TMLR; https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Q4aAITDgdP), as they show that benefits can be obtained by being smart about what to replay. I think it is also relevant to discuss McClelland et al. (2020, Phil Trans R Soc B; https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2019.0637), as they make a conceptual argument that it should not be necessary to replay everything.\n\nWhile I think it is important that these past studies on this topic are appropriately discussed, I do not think that the existence of these studies means that the novelty of the current study is compromised, as the current study approaches the problem in a novel and original way. In fact, these past studies illustrate the importance of the topic that is addressed by the current study.\n\n**Issue 3: insufficient experimental details**\n\n- How is the solver of AR trained? Is the solver also trained with \u201cadiabatic replay\u201d? Or is the solver trained with \u201cregular replay\u201d, and suffers from a linear increase in the amount of replayed data? How are the labels for the replayed data obtained?\n\n- For DGR, how are the labels obtained for training the solver?\n\n- For ER and DGR, how are the loss terms from the replayed data and the current data weighed? Are they balanced as in Van de Ven et al. (2020), or are they simply added?\n\nMinor issues:\n\n- Many of the in-text citations are formatted incorrectly\n\n- Towards top of p3: Maximally interference replay -> Maximally interfered replay\n\n- Bottom of p4: the notation DX-Y is used, but has not (yet) been introduced\n\n- Given the importance of ER in the current manuscript, the buffer size that is used should be mentioned in the main text"

In my view, one component of GMM corresponds to one distribution of several classes. When $K>$ the number of seen classes, is it possible to chose an unknown component at the query step and what dose the generated samples look like in this scenario? It seems that the ability of preventing forgetting is determined by $K$. When there are so many classes whose number $\\gg K$, it is hard to prevent forgetting due to the overlapping. If I was wrong, please correct it.\n\n Thrid, I usually don't focus too much on the experiments, but i do believe that the experiments should be improved.\n\n1. There are only two old replay methods (DGR and ER). It is better to compare it with more and new replay baselines.\n\n2. In my opinion, the potential low time cost of proposed method is a significant advantage. It is better to demonstrate this by more time cost experiments.\n\n3.

The proposed approach is a variant of deep generative replay, using a VAE with a GMM prior as a generative model. The authors argue that this choice of prior is better suited for *variant generation* which enables sampling of datapoints most likely to be interfered from the new task.

This is disappointing, as I do believe that the essence of the method has potential in different settings (for example targeting compute restricted settings, with pretrained models). \n2. The baseline numbers are very weak, which raises concerns about the empirical rigor of the work. For example, deep generative replay with a VAE of similar complexity in MIR [1] gets 80% on split mnist, *trained online* with 2 classes per task, which is arguably a much more difficult setting than the one in the paper. On that note, the paper would benefit from including this baseline in the paper. \n3. To the best of my understanding, the conceptual differences with MIR are small : the idea of fetching points close in the VAE's latent space is exactly what MIR does. In other words, AR is similar to Gen-MIR where 0 gradient ascent steps to maximize interference are done. \n4. The paper could benefit from some tweaks in the main paper. For example, it is unclear at which level latent replay operates; adding a detailed figure would greatly aid understanding. Moreover, I think the authors' interpretation of Foundation Models are merely any pretrained model, rather than a \"generalist\" model trained on vast, diverse data."
