The pipeline in figure 3 is also confusing, especially the sub-picture A and B on the right. \n\nI also have some concerns about the modules used in model2sence. For data augmentation, I am not sure why authors go with random position and scaling of CAD models. Scene differs from a single object in that it is made up of several objects following a certain room layout. It seems weird to fully ditch the layout information, especially for 3D scene representation learning. \n\nThe deep convex hull regularization is similar to existing anchor-based point feature learning methods, which has also been applied to scene-level and demonstrated good results. And this leads to another issue with baseline comparison methods. For the results in table 1 and 2, all baselines are trained at the most basic point-level. More advanced baselines such as those anchor-based ones should be included for fairness."

                "value": "The paper presents a framework for learning 3D indoor scene representations from CAD models and language commands. The goal is to learn better scene representation for scene understanding tasks, mainly perception tasks such as 3D object detection and scene segmentation. There exist two main challenges in solving this task using a dataset of CAD models \u2013 (1) the existence of CAD_models-to-3D_scenes domain gap, and (2) synthetic to real domain gap. It should be noted that the 3D indoor scenes are represented as point clouds in this work.\n\nThese challenges are addressed by three main parts: data pre-processing, latent space regularization using Deep Convex Hull regularization, and designing an objective function that allows for using language embeddings to better learn point feature embeddings in the 3D scene. Note that the points can be sampled on the surface of a CAD model (see below).\nThe data pre-processing step is done to reduce the model-to-scene gap. Here, CAD models are placed on the floor of an existing scanned scene (represented as a point cloud) to simulate a \u201ccrowded\u201d scene (as is referred to in the paper; see P2, second line in the first paragraph). The CAD models and the 3D scene scans are rotated randomly, scaled randomly by a scaling factor in the range [0.9, 1.1], and a model is randomly placed in a scene.\nThe latent regularization step is done by projecting point features from the input CAD models and the input scene into a common space constrained to be convex. This step is called a Deep Convex Hull Regularization (DCR).\n\nTo summarize, Input:  Labeled CAD models and a 3D scene scan (i.e., a point cloud)\nTask: Learn scene representations \n\nDataset used:\nModelNet , ScanNet and S3DIS datasets\n\nUnderlying Neural Network:\nThe paper uses two types of neural frameworks.\nOne is MinkowskiNet14 whose backbone is made of 3D Conv Layers. The other framework that is employed is a MLP-based contrastive learning setting (this is where visual-language connection is introduced). \n\nLoss function: \nCross Entropy Loss in learning the visual-language embeddings (see Eq 3)\n\nQuantitative Metric:\n3D object saliency detection -- mAP (mean average precision), \nZero-shot 3D semantic segmentation \u2013 mIoU"

For example, in Sec 2.2, the first line says \u201cSince the network is only trained\u2026.\u201d \u2013 there has been no mention of the \u201cthe\u201d network before this in the Method section. The clarity of thought in writing this is lacking. The readers can understand that there is a neural network that is employed but the first sentence does not document the research well. Please provide a context first and then follow it up with the first sentence of Sec 2.2.\nThe same goes for the first reference of DCR on P2. It is difficult to understand what point features are referred to in this sentence \u201cto project point features into a unified convex hull space that further \u2026.\u201d. Prior to this sentence, there is no info/mention on what kind of representation is used. Okay, the reader has to understand that it is point cloud representation. But which specific points are being sampled/referred to? You get my point. The paper lacks serious clarity of writing. This is also seen in the Section numbering, where the word \u201cIntroduction\u201d as a section heading is missing.\n\n2)\tI am not sure what a \u201ccrowded scene\u201d means, but I am guessing the paper meant to say that it is to simulate a real-world scene. This, as is claimed in the paper, is to reduce the CAD_model-to-scene gap. I agree to some extent on this, but it can also reduce the synthetic-to-real gap. Why is this not the case?\n3)\tIt would help the readers if a single sentence is written to introduce \u201cprototypes\u201d before starting with the formulations on P5. I am still confused as to what is a \u201cprototype\u201d. Is it a template/basis function?\n4)\tIt is unclear as to why there is a need to introduce visual-language embeddings. I am having a hard time understanding the motivation for going from the DCR step to the language embedding step. Moreover, it is not described as to how these language prompts for the CAD models/ scenes are obtained. The overall framework of the paper is not convincing.\n5)\tFig 4 \u2013 what is the notion of saliency? Is it just object detection? If so, how does the algorithm understand saliency in a scene composed of multiple objects? Plus, how is the saliency visualized?\n6)\tNot sure if PointContrast is the only work that needs to be compared to. There are follow-ups of PointContrast that are more recent, which could be discussed. This is a weak weakness, so, I can overlook this if the paper fared in other aspects.\n7)\tNo discussion of the limitations"

The caption says \u201cimproved accuracy\u201d, but as I understand, the evaluation metric for semantic segmentation is mIoU. There is a discrepancy here. Using the word \u201caccuracy\u201d is misleading. \n2)\tThe same goes for Table 4, but it is a little clearer in this Table that \u201caccuracy\u201d is being referred to as mAP scores. Again, using a better term, like \u201cimproved performance\u201d, is apt.\n3)\tAs explained in Sec 2.1, a CAD model is placed on the scene floor. How is this done? Can you briefly discuss this? \n4)\tAlso, it is mentioned that the CAD models are scaled to match real scenes\u2019 object size. I am not sure how this is done. The scene scan contains objects of different sizes, say, TV stand, Lamp, Coffee Table, etc. and as I understand, these scene semantics are not known. Only the CAD model labels are known during training. So, how is the scaling done? One needs to have a reference object (i.e., its point cloud) from the scene to obtain the scaling factor by which the CAD model needs to be scaled when it is being placed in the scene.\n5)\tRandom rotation transformation on CAD models \u2013 This cannot be true. If you do this in the SO3 space, rotated objects will be implausibly placed in the scene."
