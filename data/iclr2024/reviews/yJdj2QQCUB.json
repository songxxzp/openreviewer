GPSE can learn representations for a variety of PSEs and is notably adaptable. When trained on a large molecular graph dataset, it can be applied successfully to different datasets, even those with differing distributions or modalities. The study shows that GPSE-enhanced models can either improve performance or match the results of models using explicitly computed PSEs. This contribution suggests the potential for large pre-trained models in extracting graph positional and structural information, positioning them as strong alternatives to current methods."
