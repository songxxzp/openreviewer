However, previous works relied on additional supervision to produce fine-grained segmentation maps. The authors of this study utilized semantic knowledge extracted from Stable Diffusion (SD) to build an image segmentor that can generate fine-grained segmentation maps without additional training. The study overcomes the challenge of identifying semantic correspondences between image pixels and spatial locations of low-dimensional feature maps by analyzing SD's generation process. The produced segmentation maps were well delineated and captured detailed parts of the images, indicating highly accurate pixel-level semantic knowledge in diffusion models."

To obtain the final segmentation at resolution 512x512, the method studies how much the final pixel values depend on different masked 16x16 feature areas. In effect, the proposed approach can provide pixel-level k-class segmentation maps for each provided image, without requiring any training or text prompts. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves good performance on the tasks of unsupervised semantic segmentation and annotation-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation."

The proposed method segments images into K classes, and the pixels belonging to the same objects tend to fall within same segments.\n- The method does not require re-training the DM, test-time optimisation, or text prompts. It can be applied to images of diverse datasets rather straightforwardly. \n- The method shows impressive results when applied to downstream applications like unsupervised segmentation."

The modification to make it work with SD (Sec. 3.3) makes sense and works, but is not particularly educating or insightful, to my opinion.\n- Overall, the inventive step of the method is strongly tailored for the family of Stable Diffusion models. Although this makes sense as many state-of-the-art DMs belong to this family, the method still may become not so much applicable in case of other types of DMs.\n- [Xu et al, CVPR23] noted that using pre-trained SD with zero text input is suboptimal for feature extraction.
