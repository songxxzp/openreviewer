                "value": "**Summary:**\n\nThis paper introduces the MGTST (Multi-scale and cross-channel Gated Time-Series Transformer) model, aiming to address the limitations of current transformer-based models in multivariate long-term time-series forecasting. The authors propose several novel components, including Parallel Multi-Scale Architecture (PMSA), Temporal Embedding with Representation Tokens (TERT), Cross-Channel Attention and Gated Mechanism (CCAGM), and Channel Grouping (CG). The paper claims that MGTST outperforms existing models on several benchmark datasets.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\nA new MGTST model is proposed, which consists  PMSA, TERT, CCAGM, and CG modules.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*Insufficient Justification for Module Design:* The paper describes the procedures of the proposed modules but lacks a clear explanation of the underlying inductive biases and the rationale behind choosing these specific designs. For instance, the advantage of using gated attention over standard attention in time-series forecasting is not adequately discussed.\n\nBy the way, from my perspective, the parallel multi-scale structure and the CLS token seem not new in forecasting literature. For example, the multi-scale structure design in Crossformer starts from Unet. Unet contains the skip connection between the encoder and decoder at the same resolution which can be viewed as a parallel multi-scale design. Thus the Crossformer is not a simple sequential design as shown in Figure 3 but also contains a parallel design. The CARD (Xue et al., 2023) also considered the CLS token (e.g., Figure 1 in Xue et al., 2023). I have to admit that the exact design of the parallel multi-scale structure and CLS token are not the same as the counterparts in Crossformer and CARD but based on the current presentation I don't think they are significantly different.\n\n\n\n*Numerical Comparison:* While the paper claims superior performance over baseline models, the results of PatchTST can be better according to the original paper. In PatchTST paper, results with two different input lengths, PatchTST/64 (512 input length) and PatchTST/42 (336 input length) are reported. In complexity settings (e.g., Electricity, Traffic, and Weather), PatchTST/64 with 512 input length has better performance than those with 336 input length. In particular, in the Traffic setting, PatchTST/64 obtains 0.360/0.379/0.392/0.432 MSE scores for 96/192/336/720 forecasting lengths, which are better than both MGTST-336 and MGTST-512. As authors consider two different input lengths, it would be better to also include experiments PatchTST/64.\n\n*Dataloader Issue:* The sample codes seem to have the same issue in the test dataloader part as the original PatchTST paper, in which the last several test samples would be ignored. A similar observation has also been reported in TIDE paper. It would be better to fix the dataloader issues and update the crossposting results. \n\n\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Can authors elaborate more on why the gated mechanism is useful in the forecasting tasks?\n2. Will the performance of the channel grouping module depend on the order of channels? After a random permutation on the order of channels, it seems that different groups will be obtained. Moreover, when setting group number 1, the settings of 5 datasets out of 7, how would channel grouping work, and how does it differ from standard attention?\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n\n1. In the paragraph before section 3.1 and section 3.2, $\\frac{L\\_{input} - L\\_{patch}}{S_{stride}}$ -->  $\\lfloor\\frac{L\\_{input} - L\\_{patch}}{S_{stride}}\\rfloor$ \n\n2. Discussion for Crossformer in Section A.1.3. The Crossformer and PatchTST are concurrent work. The statement that \"*...adds a cross-attention layer on the top of PatchTST*\" seems improper from my perspective. \n\n\nAt this stage, the paper's contributions do not appear substantial enough for acceptance at a top-tier machine learning conference like ICLR. The novelty and effectiveness of the proposed components need to be more convincingly demonstrated. However, I am open to reconsidering my decision if the authors can address these concerns in their rebuttal.\n\n\n\n\n**Reference**\n\nTIDE: Das, Abhimanyu, Weihao Kong, Andrew Leach, Rajat Sen, and Rose Yu. \"Long-term Forecasting with TiDE: Time-series Dense Encoder"
