A further explanation of the intuition here might be necessary.\n- As for the experiments, it seems only the proposed NODA method needs a warmup.

Another feature of this framework is the fact that it assumes that the measurements are inherently noisy and also assumes in general that the dynamics themselves could be noisy. The authors base their architectural design on the semilinear operator by proposing a time-discretization that they later parametrize using Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). An essential facet of their research lies in their emphasis on learning correction operators, and this is substantiated by comprehensive ablation studies that illustrate their efficacy. In summary, the method presented in this work yields notably robust outcomes, particularly in the context of the considered datasets.\n\nThe first weakness that I pointed to in the weakness section is a huge one in my opinion and is reflected in my score. I am ready to change my score if that weakness is addressed since I think it will make the whole paper much better."

I tried going through the effort of deriving it myself but couldn't get the same results, so it's critical that this step is justified (you can include the proof in the appendix if it burdens the main text) but a proof must be provided since the whole method is based on it.\n- This is a \"weak\" weakness but given that the setting considered in the paper is that of $y(t)$ being just noise added to $z(t)$, it seems perhaps too much trying to learn a linear operator ($I_d$ in this case) using a non-linear neural net. While I understand that this was done to accomodate general case scenarios, it would be nice to see some ablation experiments showing the superiority of using a neural net for learning the operator $C$ as compared to using either: A learnable projection matrix or using not learning it at all and assuming $C=I_d$. Also, having an additional dataset where $C$ is not trivial could help motivate the choice of the architecture for it.\n- In the main text and the paper from Afshar et al. (2022), The *observer gain* $K(t)$ needs to satisfy the condition that in the absence of noise from the system dynamics $z(t)$ and noise from the measurements $y(t)$, $\\hat{z}(t)\\rightarrow z(t)$, yet nothing is said about that when the architecture for it was introduced in Eq. 15. Perhaps a pretraining period where no noise is introduced in the samples could be used to make sure that the learned $K$ satisfies the aforementioned condition (at least approximately) and then finetuning further using your training scheme."
