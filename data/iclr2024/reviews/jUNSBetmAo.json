The method consists of training a Linear Neural Network, essentially an MLP without nonlinearities with decreasing dimensionalities, for each ground truth factor. The objective function involves training (potentially non-linear) predictor heads on top of each hidden layer. Using QR decomposition on the learned NN weights together with loss estimates from each predictor, the authors estimate basis vectors for each ground-truth factor, together with their importance weightings. By computing such vectors for each g.t. factor they estimate both the subspaces in the learned latent space and compute a measure of orthogonality between subspaces for dfiferent g.t. factors.\n\nUsefulness of the metric is evaluated on both synthetic and real data."

This lack of technical detail in the main body is not compensated by the availability of appendices, supplementary materials or code. One key aspect that is unclear to me is how one is expected to identify the generative factors set $z_1,\\dots, z_K$ and how such $K$ is determined in general. The method involves training a potentially large amount of regressors and little information is provided on how this is done in practice (e.g. how much should the training be pushed in terms of regression error? What are the stopping conditions? How are the linear model initialised?).\n\nW2) The positioning with respect to the literature is on the weak end. The paper misses to discussion and cite works formalising weaker forms disentanglement [A, B, C]. In particular, it would seem relevant to discuss the relationship between the proposed approach and those building on (and measuring) linear symmetry-based disentanglement [B,D].\n\nW3) While the experiments are generally well-designed, the evidence they provide does not seem enough to support the major claims of this paper. As long as one departs from the ideal setting, it is difficult to assess the added value of IWO over DCI and MIG. Additional experiments are needed on more challenging datasets, such as ModelNet40 and COIL-100, possibly enlarging the scope of methods to compare with by including those in [B,D]. It would also be of help to qualitatively explore the impact of the proposed methodology, e.g. by exploring the effects of manipulating the representations over the relevant subspaces \u201csuggested\u201d by the metrics. \n\nW4) The proposed methodology seems very computationally involved. I am using the word \u201cseems\u201d as the paper lacks a comparative assessment of the cost of the method. This should be done while considering more realistically sized problems, involving latent spaces of non-trivial size.\n\n[A] https://proceedings.neurips.cc//paper/2020/file/9a02387b02ce7de2dac4b925892f68fb-Paper.pdf\n\n[B] https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/tonnaer22a/tonnaer22a.pdf\n\n[C] https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892093\n\n[D] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13306.pdf"

Further, several crucial algorithmic components are described in a minimal fashion with supporting equations,illustrations, or pseudo-code. For example, the text above Eq. (2) and the text above Eq. (4). Given that the proposed method does not seem to be overly complex, I find it disappointing that its description is somewhat vague.\n\nAnother weakness is the evaluation section. Evaluating disentangled factors is a long-standing problem in representation learning. In particular, there are established benchmarks and papers focused on this particular problem.
