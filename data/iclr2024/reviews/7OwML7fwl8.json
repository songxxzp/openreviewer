The refinement is based on dual VAEs in which the high-conf one is to extract most label-related features for classification while simultaneously injecting fairness knowledge from the low-conf one (in an EMA style). Low-conf one is a set unsupervised whose latent representation encouraged to be close to high-conf samples's expectation. They demonstrated the idea on new Adult and COMPAS datasets."

                "value": "1. In the first paragraph of Introduction, the evaluation to works that maximize the utility of the worst-case group is not precise. The Rawsian fairness (no sensitive attribute) based research leveraged side information (e.g., group ratio) to identify protected group, instead of relying on the correlation with observed features. Following this concern, DRO and ARL used as baselines in this paper are not very suitable, because they both highlighted that accuracy-related utility should be equal across different groups. Note that EO and DP are not criteria designed for these works, although you can conduct so.\n\n2. Given a threshold of 0.6 for splitting the training dataset and the resultant subsets have the distinct performance on EO and DP, which might be questionable. Recalling the definition of EO and DP, we see that they are both computed over predicted y. Since low-conf data tend to appear near to decision boundary, they certainly will yield small EO and DP values. Thus, letting low-conf data represent fairness is not very convincing for me. OOD data is NOT unbiased data.\n\n3. In the refinement stage, notice that only high-conf data will be trained for classification while low-conf examples only contributes some \"fair features\" in a regularization style. However, from Fig.2, the label in the purple box tried to suggest all data were well mapped to their ground truth labels. So, have you checked if the model has correctly classified low-conf data after training? If yes, why not incorporate a supervised loss therein? If not, how to guarantee a better generalization on test set?\n\n4. As low-conf generator is thought having the desired fairness knowledge, then how about using its mu and sigma as a pseudo supervision (regression) for high-conf data? Any theoretical or experimental evidence of your method? Basically, you are minimizing the distance between any two of N(mu1, sigma1), N(mu2, sigma2), and N(0,I).\n\n5. Generator in the method should refer to the entire VAE. As the final model only takes encoder, can you clarify the role of decoder during training? \n\n6. Two compared methods are from Chai's recent work, leading me to check the connection with this baseline. In Chai's work, they have pointed out the samples near to the decision influence the fairness, while this paper starts from confidence, similar to my insight mentioned above. Authors should clarify their connections.\n\n7. The applied baselines are not very supportive to the targeted challenges. I felt confused why using proxy attributes and fairness-accuracy trade-off works are not included. Also, why only two datasets are used in the paper? Are the proposed method restricted to some specific datasets? \n\n8. Regarding the learnable noise, it is like a patch to this framework, as you have to learn additional model parameters. To make latent features only related to label, one can encourage H(z,y) and reduce H(x,z), from the information theory perspective."

If the idea is to leverage low- and high-confidence data, why not just train two separate classifiers and then use ensemble? What is the purpose of adding learnable noise? I do not understand the author's explanation in 4.3.1. What is $\\eta$ in Eq. (1)? What is the corresponding mathematical definition of \"Pseudo-distribution\" in Figure 1? Is it $\\mathcal{L}_L$ in Eq.(2)? In general, I think the technical part is poorly written, and would cause unnecessary confusion to readers.\n\n2. Can authors explain why the design can mitigate bias well when has no access to full sensitive attributes? The sensitive attribute $S$ is rarely mentioned after the problem formulation in Section 3. How does the method connect to missing $S$? I might miss it, but it shows the paper does not highlight how the method works.\n\n3. The experiment on COMPAS does not seem to outperform other methods in an obvious way. The two fairness measures improve but the accuracy also drops. It would be clearer if the results could be presented in an accuracy vs. fairness Pareto frontier style plot.\n\n4. The evaluation is done only on two tabular datasets. This is rare in fairness literature. Can authors justify why it is only tested on two tabular datasets?"

The rationale behind this division lies in the observation that low-confidence encodes fairness-related knowledge, while high-confidence pertains to discriminative information. The refinement process employs dual Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), where the high-confidence VAE extracts label-related features for classification. Simultaneously, it injects fairness knowledge from the low-confidence VAE, following an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) style. The low-confidence VAE operates in an unsupervised manner, with its latent representation encouraged to be proximate to the expectation of high-confidence samples. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated on Adult and COMPAS datasets."

However, it is unclear why and when it happens. For example, does this just happen to be due to the data distribution nature of the COMPAS dataset? The author should provide more explanations and discussions about this, theoretically or empirically, since this key property affects the scope of application of the proposed method.\n\n2) It is also unclear that why the learnable noises need to be added in this paper. Is it to block information of sensitive information? In addition to the final classification results, I suggest that the author give some relevant analytical experiments to prove the validity of the learned noises. For example, if we train a classifier for sensitive attributes on the data with learned noises, is it difficult to predict sensitive attributes accurately?\n\n3) (main concern) It seems that the compared baselines are not strong enough. Please note that some works have gone beyond the baselines used in this paper such as CvaR DRO, LfF, JTT. Moreover, only two tabular datasets are used. I encourage the author to perform experiments on more datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
