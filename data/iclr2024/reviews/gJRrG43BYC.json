In the abstract and introduction, the authors claim that the motivation of this work is to avoid the expensive differentiation for the backward propagation in the implicit model. Such a process usually happens during the training of the model. However, the method adopted in this paper requires a well-trained implicit model, which means that expensive differentiation has been performed. Thus, it is hard to say that this method can avoid the expensive backward differentiation in the implicit model. \n\n2. As for the experiments, the reviewer believes some experimental settings are not common choices and hopes the authors can explain their reasons:\n\n    (a)  In the sparsity experiment, the definition of sparsity is usually used in the unstructured pruning algorithm, which counts the number of non-zero parameters. However, all the baseline methods are structured pruning algorithms. In those algorithms, we care about the number of non-zero rows, rather than the non-zero elements. This difference in the definition makes the comparison unfair. Therefore, the reviewer suggests the author compare their method with the unstructured pruning algorithms.\n\n   (b)  In the robustness experiment, the choice of $\\epsilon$ is so small. On the Fashion MNIST datasets, the common choices of $\\epsilon$ are 0.1 or 0.2. Also, the authors do not compare the proposed algorithm with any existing algorithm in the robustness experiment.\n\nDue to the above problems, the reviewer suggests the author rethink the application of their framework and method. Although the reviewer believes the idea is interesting, the experimental results and the motivation in this paper are not strong enough."
