The model consists of the following three building blocks (1) recognition of irregular and scale-invariant patterns in each time series sample (2) generation of synthesized segments of patterns and (3) evolving of the latter over time."

Empirical evidence is accessed through experiments on three real-world financial assets; the results are state-of-the-art. I appreciate Figure 3 since it provides a concise overview of the proposed methods."

                "value": "1. (Pattern Conjecture) The reasons given to support the claim that univariate financial time series data (in general) embody recurring complex patterns over time appear vague and lack thorough evaluation. For example, the authors consider only a single financial data set (i.e., the S&P 500 index), and the analytical approach seems very fine-grained and not very general. It would be helpful to have insights into the clustering results, i.e., indicating the actual number of classes as well as the number of items per class, or showing multiple centers, etc. And even though Appendix A/B broadens some aspects there remains a lack of rigor in the arguments/results.\n\n2. (Pattern Evolution) I apologize, but I lack understanding of the learning aspects of the pattern evolution network $\\phi$. How do you extract the information used from the training data? I assume my question refers to the *Info()* function in $\\texttt{line 6} \\$ of *Algorithm 2*. Unfortunately, I can't find any more detailed information about it.\n\n3. (Evaluation and Reproducibility)\nOverall, I am not convinced that the proposed pattern-centric approach really adds complementary information to learning financial time series data. I suppose this is primarily due to deficiencies in the evaluation of the pattern recognition module. I also miss a detailed description of the included datasets and results reproducibility is very limited due no code submission."

(p.9 Training on Augmentation) In case of a *one-day* ahead forecast I would have expected comparison to a very *naive* approach, e.g., using the value of the previous day as prediction; especially in reference to the Markov property. Can you additionally include a multiple-day forecast?\n4. Can you assess on computational complexity and runtime of the approach compared to the baselines?"
