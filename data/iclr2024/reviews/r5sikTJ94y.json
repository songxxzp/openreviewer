Furthermore, the training procedure includes complex tuning of regularization and augmentation, which would also hinder the reproduction of the claimed benefits. Thus, to reproduce the impact of ADC quantization on the models and the effectiveness of RAOQ, it is desirable to provide a reference code that reveals the error modeling of ADC quantization and the hyper-parameter settings. \n\n- Lack of fundamental understanding of distribution shifts on SQNR. The authors claim that increasing the variance of W and the 2nd moment of X would improve SQNR. However, there is only limited empirical evidence to support their claims without theoretical justification. Therefore, there are many unanswered questions such as:\n1) They ignore the impact of the distribution shift of W and X on quantization errors. \n2) The claim that Var[Y] can be maximized by maximizing Var[W] and E[X^2] is weakly supported.\n3) Fig. 3.b shows a compound effect of W-reshape and A-shift, but does not show an individual impact separately.\n\n- The rationale for enhancing performance by adding the loss terms for various bit precisions in BitAug to the original loss and gradient calculations seems insufficiently explained. The authors properly showed the difficulty of fine-tuning with ADC quantization, but there is little justification for why the proposed BitAug helps optimization. \n\n- The bit precision candidate selection in BitAug is empirical. According to Appendix C, the bit\nprecision candidate set that shows good performance in MobileNetV2 is applied across all other\nnetworks, including BERT and ResNet\n\n- As the authors admitted, the Kurtosis regularization for weight quantization was already proposed by (Shkolnik et al., 2020) with a similar purpose of flattening weight distribution. Therefore, the novelty of W-reshape is not clear. \n\n- Not all operations of the model are mapped to IMC. Based on Appendix E, while the research\nargues that the operations not mapped to IMC (e.g., the first and last layer in CNN, depth wise\nconvolution in the MobileNet family, the second matrix matrix multipl ication inside the Multi Head\nAttention of BERT) represent a small fraction of the total operations, these operations are typically\nlocated intermittently within models.

(instead of stopping at zero-center, in Fig. 3.a(bottom))\n\n- For the same ADC bit-precision, how can BitAug adjust the loss surface?
