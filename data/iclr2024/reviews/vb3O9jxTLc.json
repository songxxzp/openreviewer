To spot problematic concept pairings, LLMs are employed. Additionally, the paper presents a method called 'Mixture of Concept Experts' (MoCE) to alleviate these identified conceptual blind spots during the diffusion model\u2019s denoising stages. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in mitigating the occurrence of conceptual blind spots."

Is there a way to understand the type of prompts the model gets right and the cases the proposed MoCE fails to handle? Another weakness with the paper is the readability. Some of the sections took me multiple readings. Also, in some places, for example in the Human evaluation section, it is not very clear how many test samples are considered. I also find a slight disconnect between the abstract and the three key contributions highlighted in the introduction section. I suggest authors make them more coherent in the final version (for example, there is no mention of dataset contribution in abstract but the dataset is listed as a key contribution in introduction)."

Some important terms such as \"conceptual blind spots,\" \"concept pairs,\" and \"Socratic reasoning/questioning\" are not clearly defined, which hinders the understanding of the paper. A large portion of the paper is describing the data collection process. However, the overall goal of the dataset is not clearly explained, and the reason behind each round is also not explained. The methodology section is also confusing. How is the proposed metric $D$ used during generation? Why is the binary search algorithm used for generation? Maybe an algorithm table could help explain the method more clearly.\n2. The experiment setting is problematic. First, only the standard stable diffusion model is used as baseline. No comparison is provided for related works mentioned in Section 2. Second, the proposed metric $D$ is used during generation as well as for evaluation. So there might be unfair advantages for the proposed method.\n3. Some notations are wrong. For example, in Background of Section 4, $I$ shouldn't denote the input image.\n4.
