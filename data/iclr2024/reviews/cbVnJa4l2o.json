Other than the fact that some prompt worked for a small set of robotic manipulation tasks, I am not sure what I learnt from this paper. \n2. Limited evaluation: \n -  Furthermore, the evaluation tasks are too simple. Unclear how affordance prompting would scale to more complex or more real world tasks, for instance manipulation in cluttered settings or situations with partial observability.\n - Unclear how well LLM+A will do without a really strong llm such as GPT4. The use of GPT4 also makes it a computationally slow framework for online deployment. To that end, it would be good for the authors to report execution time/time to solve for their evaluation tasks. I encourage authors to also do real-world evaluation to really put the runtime in perspective. Lastly, I'd also like to see LLM+A performance with other opensource models like Llama2 or Vicuna.\n- Also unclear if the results are reproducible given GPT4's changing capabilities over time: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09009.pdf I therefore encourage authors to consider open source alternatives, at the least time-stamp their GPT4 evaluations. \n3. Baselines: It is also unclear how the authors chose the baselines they compare with. They do not provide a rationale on their selection of baselines. Instead they simply choose some subset of llm prompt based approaches. Was the goal to just compare their prompt style? Why not also compare with Palm-e, RT-2, GATO, VIMA to show that their training-free prompt-based approach works better than these others that required additional data for training? Even if the goal is to compare prompt-based approaches, many others come to mind such as text2motion: https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/text2motion \n4. Limited analysis: Given that the tasks were evaluated in sim, I would have liked a more detailed failure analysis, for instance assuming perfect vision information. Authors explain that Block2Block has low success rate because of the need to reason about interaction with other blocks. But then shouldnt this be the case with SeparateBlock task as well? Also, what about Block2Position task? The success rates in Block2Position task also seem low (42%)."

As this is totally different in the pushing and the pick&place experiments. Also it is not clear how the position control is generated (what is the size of the vector?, is it restricted?)\n\n**Results**\n\nIt was not clear why the accuracy is so low despite the reasoning power of the LLM and assuming that the affordance prompting is helping out.
