Their method uses several easy to compute reward factors and it compares trajectories based on these factors by going from more important to a less important factor. These comparisons are then used to fit a reward function which is used in RL optimisation. The authors present results on a set of diverse benchmarks ranging from control to traffic simulation and coding."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The paper is not very clearly written and it left me with a few unclear points which are important for the proposed problem setting. The authors start by talking about human feedback in reinforcement learning, but it is not clear from the method description what feedback is provided by humans. Is it the order of factors? Or is it feedback in the form of comparisons? What exactly is the problem setting? For example, what are the assumptions about the relationship between the reward factors and the true reward? \n- Assuming that humans provide the comparisons in the form of weak preferences, it is not clear to me how it can be ensured that comparisons are in the form described on page 4 (fixed precise threshold, always correct). Also, usually in RLHF the humans would provide comparisons of full trajectories because this is a more reliable feedback compared to other types of feedback. Assuming that the comparisons are coming from the algorithm itself, it seems to me that the method is just a form of reward engineering that allows one to find the coefficients by ensuring certain rules (the importance order of factors) are respected. \n- One limitation of the method is that it requires reward factors which are hand crafted. In many real world applications of RL there has been a tendency of moving away from the hand crafted rewards and learning reward functions directly from the observations which are represented in the raw form (e.g., images or text). I would like to hear a discussion on the applicability of the method to the various realistic domains. \n- I have some questions and concerns about the experiments. For example, in all three environments the authors say that the ground truth reward is a linear combination of the factors. In this case it is not clear to me why one would need a non-linear function (MLP) for the learnt reward. Then, regarding the baselines, a classical baseline would be a (potentially linear) reward learnt as a function of factors on the basis of trajectory comparisons from human annotators. This is the most classical RLHF setting and it would be informative to compare the proposed method to it.\n\nMinor points:\n- I didn't find Algorithm 1 and Figure 2 necessary for understanding that part of the methodology, I think it can be skipped in favor of a more clear description of the problem setting and assumptions.\n- I didn't understand why GT line is worse than other methods in Figure 3(c).\n- Section 4.3 argues that the proposed method is quite flexible. It would be nice to hear a discussion of how this compares to the studied baselines such a reward engineering."

If the comparison result is \"tie\", then, this method moves to the next stage and does the same thing. This decision tree is a cascade of binary classifiers.

When comparing two trajectories, HERON systematically evaluates the reward factors in sequence to determine their preferences. To elaborate, HERON initiates the comparison with the first reward factor, and the labeling procedure (i.e., assigning a binary label) concludes if the disparity exceeds a predefined threshold. If the dissimilarity falls below the threshold, HERON proceeds to compare the next reward factor, iteratively following this process until all the reward factors have been assessed."

Here, the motivation for utilizing a preference-based reward learning framework is unclear. In the original preference-based RL framework, human preferences are generated from the Bradley\u2013Terry model under an unknown utility function and the goal of reward learning is approximating this function based on preference datasets. However, when we have a ranking between multiple objectives, why we also use this framework is unclear. Basically, what is the target of the reward learning? The authors need to clarify this part.\n\n* Lack of ability in personalization. Unlike the standard preference-based learning framework, the ability to obtain personalized rewards is limited. Humans only can specify the ranking between objectives and it is hard to control the tradeoff between objectives. For example, let's consider a case where there are two objectives. Assume that there are two human annotators with the same ranking but the first human wanna get a reward function that emphasizes the first objective more. In this case, this framework can't provide a different reward for two human annotators (because the ranking is still the same). It would be nice if the authors could discuss this limitation."
