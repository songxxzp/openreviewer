Unlike previous approaches, this method does not require any extra data and is adept at managing glossy objects and high intensity lighting conditions.\n\nThe method has three stages: In the first stage, the scene's radiance and Signed Distance Function (SDF) are reconstructed. A novel training strategy is introduced here, which leverages both volume and surface rendering. This strategy effectively addresses complex, view-dependent lighting effects during surface reconstruction. In the second stage, light visibility and indirect illumination are distilled from the learned SDF and radiance field using learnable neural networks. Finally, materials and direct illuminations are recovered using a set of Spherical Gaussians."

It clearly outlines previous works and offers a balanced comparison with them. The paper's contributions are clearly stated, and it provides a comprehensive ablation study on its proposed enhancements. \n- From the experiments, it's evident that this paper achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of material and geometry reconstruction. The ablation study further reinforces the validity of the improvements proposed.\n- I find the first stage of this paper particularly innovative. It was previously unknown that optimizing both volume and surface rendering concurrently could enhance surface geometry, especially in specular regions. This concept might be applied in other contexts to address surface geometry challenges arising from pronounced specular highlights."

The final stage also bears similarities to IndiSG. Given these observations, I contend that the paper presents limited novelty in its three-stage training approach.\n- The proposed Specular Albedo Index (SAI) lacks solid theoretical grounding. The authors don't clearly explain why the specular albedo is applied only to the indirect component (as seen in eq-13) and not to the direct component (eq-10). Furthermore, the experiments indicate that the introduction of SAI causes the method to underperform in its illumination estimation.

Developing good ground truth for body and surface reflection is challenging at best for real imagery.  However, by focusing the loss on surface reconstruction, which is a derivative of the estimate of body and surface reflection, they were able to provide reasonable feedback to the decomposition networks.\n\nI like the fact that the networks must be learning linear color functions (which is necessary because adding body and surface reflection in sRGB space would produce the wrong values).  \n\nThe qualitative and quantitative results are strong for the data sets evaluated.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The primary weakness is a lack of consistency with vocabulary and definitions.  There is a long history of physical models of appearance, and the model the authors derive is effectively the Bi-illuminant Dichromatic Reflection model (see equations 9 and 10 of Maxwell et. al, CVPR 2008) which is built on the Dichromatic Reflection model (Shafer, 1986).  The physics-based vision community has long used the terms body reflection and surface reflection to refer to what the authors are calling diffuse radiance and specular radiance.  Using a phrase like \"surface diffuse radiance\" is mixing this vocabulary and creates confusion.\n\nAnother confusing example is the sentence  \"Diffuse radiance refers to the scattered light that illuminates a surface or space evenly and without distinct shadows or reflections.\"   Illumination is irradiance onto a surface, while radiance is light leaving the surface.  I believe what the authors are trying to describe is what is often referred to as ambient illumination, which is the light arriving at a surface from all directions except those that point at a direct light source (the source of shadows and shading).  The ambient illumination is then what is reflected by the surface to create ambient body reflection (diffuse diffuse radiance?) and ambient surface reflection (diffuse specular radiance ?).  Using body reflection and surface reflection makes the concepts more clear because it refers to the mechanism of reflection rather than a descriptive term.\n\nThe term \"diffuse albedo\" is also somewhat confusing, though albedo is commonly used (for greyscale?).  Using something like body reflection color is less confusing.\n\nMy only other complaint is the reference to a number of appendices, which aren't present in the review copy.  Is it possible to squeeze just the critical points into the actual paper?"

If linear, then is the original data linear, or are they taking the sRGB inverse of sRGB JPG data?\n\nJust to clarify, can the stage 3 models of direct illumination learn multiple direct illuminants?  How is this related to the visibility calculations in stage 2?  Or is there an implicit assumption of a single direct illuminant?  \n\nAre there any examples of multiple direct illuminants in the data sets evaluated?\n\nFollowing Bonneel et. al, 2017, a useful evaluation of intrinsic decomposition is to demonstrate that the decompositions are good enough to enable editing of illumination or reflectance separately. Is there a similar task whereby the authors could show a practical use of the decomposition and use it for comparison with other methods?"

The underlying approach is based on inverse rendering which has been studied and has shown quite a lot of promise recently. Motivated by NeuS/Geo-NeuS, the authors have proposed an implicit 3D reconstruction approach that works in three-stages. The first stage focus on accurate surface geometry recovery even when non-Lambertian surfaces are present and the subsequent stages involve estimating the lighting directions and visibility and BRDFs. The paper presents novel ideas and presents ablation experiments to justify the importance of the proposed ideas.

Also, training a neural network to predict the specula albedo map on top of the BRDF network is also a technical contribution to the best of my knowledge.\nThe SDF-based reconstructed geometry is robust and works well on non-Lambertian surfaces where Geo-NeuS and NeuS both produce noticeable artifacts. \n\nThe ablation study reported confirms that the specular albedo estimation improves accuracy in most cases on various datasets and also the second experiment confirms the importance of combining volumetric and surface rendering."

Therefore, including these results would be informative to confirm that the more complex image formation model does not lower performance on scenes with Lambertian objects.\n\nThe approach is quite complex and involves training several different neural networks and setting hyperparameters in different stages. While Section 3.1 is well written and provides more details, I found Sections 3.2 and 3.3 to be quite short and difficult to follow. The technical presentation is sound, but the work will be difficult to reproduce due to lack of sufficient detail, especially in Section 3.3. It will help the reader if the author present pseudo code for the full approach and clarify which modules are trained and how the associated parameters are initialized and how the various hyperparameters need to be set or tuned.\n\nThe images in the paper are very small (Figures 3, 4 and 5) making it difficult to compare the results from various methods."
