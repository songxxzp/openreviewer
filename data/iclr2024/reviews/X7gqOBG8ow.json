It proposes to consider the recovery of the 3d structure after perturbing it with Gaussian noise (similar to a denoising autoencoder). Yet, since this plain (structure-to-structure) denoising problem is only well-posed for equilibrium structures, the authors propose to consider the forces of the original structure as an additional input along with a corrupted non-equilibrium structure, which seems to make the denoising problem well-posed again. The resulting ability to also consider  non-equilibrium structures significantly increases the available amount of training data and results in significant and systematic numerical improvements on several data sets."

Is it correct to assume that the potential of any structure can be computed and that the forces are the gradient thereof? If so, it would be just two additional sentences of explanation that make the work much more clear. \n- The property \"equivariant\" is frequently used. While I know what it means, it was unclear to me what kind of equivariance (with respect to which transformations) is meant and why that influences the ability to encode forces. Rotations and translations of 3d coordinates/vectors? \n- I do not know the term \"type-L vectors\" - what does it mean? I tried googling but did not have direct success. Thus, I'd recommend defining it. Also, what is \"the projection of $f$ into type-L vectors with spherical harmonics\"? Representing the function f with L-many coefficients corresponding to spherical harmonics basis functions?\n- It would have helped me to cite something for \"SO(3) linear layer\". \n- Please double-check the manuscript for typos. \n\nPlease be aware that I am not part of your main audience.

                "value": "- **Regarding the performance improvement** . Serving as a simple modification upon previous denoising training strategy on molecular modeling, performance improvement is the most important aspect to measure the quality of this work. However, there exist several issues that need to be further clarified:\n  - The gains brought by DeNS diminish with the dataset scales up. From Table 1 and Table 2, we can see that models trained on the 2M subset of the OC20 S2EF dataset benefit a lot more from the DeNS auxiliary task compared to the OC20 S2EF-All+MD split.\n  - The improvement on MD17 is limited compared to the OC series experiments.\n  - The improvement on the IS2RE task is also limited (sometimes DeNS even hurts the performance).\n  - The gains on the energy and force metrics are not consistent across different datasets with different scales. In the OC20 tasks, models trained with the DeNS task achieve lower force errors and competitive energy errors compared to the standard training and vice versa for the OC22 tasks.\n\nThe first issue relates to the scaling property of the proposed training strategy. I recommend the authors further design experiments to investigate whether such a phenomenon is due to the inability of the proposed DeNS to bring performance gains when large-scale data is provided or other factors of the model, optimization, and so on. The second issue relates to the generality of the proposed strategy. MD17 contains simple molecules instead of adsorbate-catalyst complex in OC20/22. This dataset is much smaller than OC20/22 dataset, on which the proposed DeNS is expected to bring more gains according to the phenomenon mentioned in the first issue. However, the results in Table 5 and 6 show the gains are limited. It is suggested to further verify the generality of DeNS. The third issue relates to the significance of the force field learning task. In OC and other similar applications, what we really care about is to obtain the property of the equilibrium states like relaxed energy and structure. The error of force field model is an indirect metric. In this sense, the significance of improvement brought by DeNS on energy and force error of S2EF task should be reexamined based on the IS2RE performance.\n\nOverall, I recommend the authors to carefully clarify the proposed issues above with further experimental evidence to make some aspects of the proposed DeNS training strategy more clear for readers. I would like to increase my scores if the authors could address my concerns in this section and questions in the next section."

As DeNS training requires the forces to be encoded into the input atom features, I wonder how the force encoding module would be used in the standard training which instead uses the forces as labels.\n\n2. In Table 5, the authors demonstrate that the DeNS training is more efficient and results in larger performance gains than increasing max degrees of irreps. I wonder why the authors changed the model from EquiformerV2 to EquiformerV1 for this investigation. After all, the EquiformerV2 model is claimed to largely benefit from scaling the max degrees of irreps. How would EquiformerV2 with different max degrees of irreps behave in the same setting of Table 5?\n\n3. Could you provide more discussion on why you chose Equation 7 for the multi-scale noise scheduler?"

                "value": "The paper introduces DeNS, an approach to improve energy and force predictions with the aid of non-equilibrium structures' denoising as an auxiliary task. Its implementation feeds forces from original structures as inputs, contributing to a well-structured problem. Demonstrated results indicate minor improvements on EquiformerV2 for datasets like OC20, OC22, and MD17."

These techniques have demonstrated efficacy for energy or force predictions for non-equilibrium molecules, hence their significance.\n\n-The motivation behind the paper's approach needs additional validation.\na) The concept of \u201cencoding force as input\u201d finds extensive discussion in the paper. However, this approach needs corroborative proof from experiments. Results from Table 1e indicate energy prediction outcomes remain the same without force encoding. The possibility of label leakage and its contribution to improvement in force prediction, as discussed under question 2, needs examination.\nb) Similar problem-solving approaches have been published. A comparative discussion highlighting the distinctions and superiority of this paper's proposed methodology would prove advantageous.\n\n-The significant results were, to a large extent, achieved through Equiformer. Against Equiformer's backdrop, the improvements contributed by DeNS appear minimal.\n\n[1] Yuyang Wang, Chang Xu, Zijie Li, and Amir Barati Farimani.

                "value": "-While encoding input forces can mitigate the non-equilibrium denoising's ill-posed problem, [1] shows that denoising without force input is also plausible. Does this undermine your motivation and imply the redundancy of input force encoding?\n-Could there be label leakage when encoding forces as input for energy and force predictions of structures?\n-Given that force prediction is one of your experiments, should you consider adding the force prediction loss to eq. (6)?\n-Provision of the pseudocode for DeNS training would be beneficial. This can offer insights into the usage of Multi-Scale Noise and other hyperparameters like p_{ DeNS }."
