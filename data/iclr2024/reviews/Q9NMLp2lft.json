The paper claims that the GConvNets perform better than ConvNets because they are able to better capture spatial features and are less vulnerable to overfitting -- although not vital, it would be great to see visualizations of feature maps to show how diffrent the features of GConvNets are, compared to ConvNets.\n4. The paper mentions other works on parameter reduction in CNNs, including pruning, distillation, etc. but fails to cite relevant works or include them in comparisons. Could the authors cite relevant works in the section 1.1 and possible include comparisons with some of these methods (time permitting)?\n5.

I guess many readers in the AI community are not very much familiar with the tensor product with high ranks, and I'm one of them. Frankly speaking, I searched internet and still didn't get good answer that could match the description and examples well in the paper. It is strange that the paper spends much space for describing the well-known CapsuleNet and Transformer but does not describe the definition of the core of the proposed method clearly -- tensor product. \n\nSecond, the reason why the proposed method works well is not well explained. Throughout the paper, it is stressed that it is the \"structured neurons\" that bring the advantage of representation. CapsuleNet and Transformers are adopted as an analogy to explain this advantage. To me, this does not make much sense because the high rank tensor operations have little to do with the structures of the two models. BTW, it is hard to say Transformers have structured neurons. \n\nThird, the efficiency is not reported in the results tables. In sec 4.4 it is stated that the proposed method works very slow. This is expected because the time complexity of tensor product is high. If efficiency is not resolved, the method is hardly to be recognized by the AI community. \n\nIn summary, the proposed method is a starting point of a potentially good work, but it is not ready to be published yet."
