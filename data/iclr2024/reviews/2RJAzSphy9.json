How do we compute this quantity that depends on $r_A$, which I don't think is accessible in this setting?\n\n- Many existing comparison-based algorithms learn the reward function first and then use it to construct the policy. In contrast, Algorithm 1 chooses to learn the Borda function. What is the advantage of learning the Borda function over learning the reward function?\n\n- Both the abstract and Section 3 say the problem is offline contextual bandit, but I don't think the learner can freely query contexts and actions in the offline setting. In fact, wouldn't the ability of freely querying contexts and actions make this problem too simple? In this setting, the problem is just learning a function with a dataset chosen by the learner; the only difficulty is the data is pairwise comparisons.\n\n- In Section 5.1, the authors observed that on Jeopardy! dataset, the policy trained with AE-DPO is able to abstain when it is not expected to know the correct answer, in contrast to policies trained with other baseline methods. Should this reduction in hallucination be attributed to your algorithm or just the objective you are using (Equation (2)), which is also supposed to make the learned policy behave more prudently and abstain when it is likely to answer incorrectly?  \n\nI'm open to raising my score after reading the clarification from the authors and their discussion with other reviewers during rebuttal."

                "value": "This paper studied an interesting problem: how to actively collect data during reward model learning. The authors cast the problem into a contextual dueling bandit problem and proposed an algorithm with regret bound. Some experiments are conducted for the full LM case. \n\nOverall, I feel this work studied a timely topic but was not well executed. The current context may not be sufficient to be accepted at a top-tier ML conference. I evaluated this work from two aspects: theoretical contribution and empirical contribution.\n\nFor theoretical contribution, I feel it is rather limited. First, contextual dueling bandit has been studied for a while in the bandit community. If one only cares about worse-case simple regret bound, any algorithm that enjoys a cumulative regret guarantee can be turned into a simple regret minimization algorithm, for example, \"Optimal Algorithms for Stochastic Contextual Preference Bandits\". Second, Assumption 2 is quite strong. It is very hard to satisfy for large action space which is the case for LM. The theory largely benefits from this assumption. I do not believe any interesting LM application can satisfy this.\n\nSecond, the algorithm proposed in Section 5 is very different from the one in previous sections with guarantee and the algorithm is very heuristic. The authors seem to use ensemble dropout to estimate the standard deviation. This is very doubtful if dropout can estimate the variance well for an autoregressive transformer. As far as I know, there has been no study on that before. More importantly,  none of the win-rate is statistically significant, especially. for the Anthropic dataset. It is hard for me to trust any conclusion from such a noisy result. \n\nMinor: 1. Why the win-rate is far below 0.5 in Figures 9 and 10? I suppose the baseline is uniform sampling.\n2. The term 'offline' contextual bandits is very misleading. I think you are doing online learning: actively collect human feedback. Offline problem usually refers to the case the dataset is given.\n3. In Algorithm 1, the second action is drawn uniformly random. This is weird and why it could work? Will this benefit from Assumption 2 as well?\n4. DPO also has experiments on the Anthropic dataset. You should at least report or discuss the win-rate matched in their setting to make sure if the implementation is correct. \n5. How do you generate multiple completions?"

I read the authors' rebuttal and other reviewers' comments. \n\nIn my opinion, while the authors consider a stronger (variant) notion of suboptimality, the theoretical part (Section 4) of this paper is not novel, since the ideas of estimating Borda score and selecting the option with the maximum uncertainty is well-known in the dueling bandit and active learning literatures. I think the more interesting contributions of this paper are the well-motivated problem formulation which is applicable to LLMs, and the experiments on LLMs with the proposed algorithm. However, to some degree I agree the comments of Reviewers 7uH1 and aHAt, i.e., the algorithm in Section 5 is heuristic and a little disconnected with the theoretical results in Section 4. The algorithm design and empirical results for LLMs (Section 5) seem to lack the theoretical supports.\n\nI tend to keep my score 5, and will listen to the opinions of other reviewers and AC during the discussion period."

                "value": "- Novelty in problem selection (i.e., the setting where the contexts can be chosen instead) and the algorithm design are limited. \n- Theoretical contribution of the paper is limited to strong assumptions and the analysis techniques exist in prior works.\n- The main algorithm requires uncertainty quantification for the policy, which is difficult for LLM policies. A method based on dropout is used for such uncertainty quantification; however, why this method is used over alternatives is not discussed."
