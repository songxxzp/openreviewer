While earlier theories suggested that these nonlinearities always result in smoother features, this study reveals that, when considering feature magnitude and applying a normalized smoothness metric, ReLU and LeakyReLU can actually increase, decrease, or maintain the smoothness metric. Notably, by adjusting the input's projection in certain eigenspaces, one can manipulate the output's smoothness to achieve a desired level. The paper introduces a technique known as the \"smoothness control term\" (SCT), which is designed to regulate node feature smoothness, and it is experimentally tested to validate its effectiveness."

It disconnects node smoothness from model performance, making it carry no insights into practice and thus it is meaningless to study. \n\n    For instance, consider a graph with two classes of nodes: one class having feature values of 1, and the other class with feature values of -1. In this case, a linear classifier would have perfect classification performance.  If we consistently add one to each node's feature, the differences among node features would not change, and if we apply a classifier again to classify based on the new features, the performance would not change either---We are basically shifting all the node features by the same value and the bias term of a classifier can easily accommodate that. Such a phenomenon is well justified by the unnormalized metrics such as conventional Dirichlet energy because it would remain the same before and after we add the same value to each node. However, the normalized smoothness metric s proposed in this paper would get larger and larger, indicating that the node features are getting \"smoother\" and \"smoother\".\n\n    Given the above concern and the established research on the effects of ReLU and LeakyReLU under unnormalized smoothness [5, 27] (citations provided by the paper), this paper provides very little new theoretical insight. \n\n\n\n\n2. I also checked [5] (citation provided by the paper), and I didn\u2019t see any serious evidence, either theoretical or empirical, supporting the following highlighted claim in this paper:\n\n> [5] points out that over-smoothing \u2013 measured by the distance of node features to the eigenspace M or the Dirichlet energy \u2013 is a misnomer, and the real smoothness of a graph signal should be characterized by a normalized smoothness, e.g., normalizing the Dirichlet energy by the magnitude of the features. \n\nThe only related sentence I saw was\n\n> Finally, analyzing the real over-smoothing effect, i.e., the Rayleigh quotient $\\frac{tr(X^T \\tilde{\\Delta} X)}{||X||^2_2}$ for\ndeep GNNs is still an open and important question.\n\n But this itself doesn't justify the validity of the normalized smoothness. \n\n3.  The improvement over stronger baselines (GCNII and EGNN) in Table 1 is limited in most cases, which raises doubts about the overall effectiveness of SCT."

It challenges the conventional understanding of the role of activation functions like ReLU or leaky ReLU in the smoothing process of node features in GCNs. Traditionally, it was believed that these activation functions contribute to smoothing the node features, which is beneficial for tasks like node classification when using a limited number of Graph Convolutional Layers (GCLs). However, the authors argue that this might not always be the case, especially in deeper GCNs. Through empirical studies and theoretical analysis, the paper presents evidence that in deeper networks, the node features might actually become less smooth, contrary to the established belief. This finding is significant as it opens up new avenues for understanding and improving the learning process in deep GCNs, particularly concerning the choice and role of activation functions in shaping the learned node features."
