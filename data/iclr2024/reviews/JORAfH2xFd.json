Then, the article studies several popular deep generative models on standard benchmarks to investigate what happens in practice."

While flows may have a larger $\\epsilon$ due to their capacity issues, autoregressive models might be a better objective to look at. I'd like to see some experiments on this. \n\nRegarding Fig 3, the trends are not clear enough, and I'd like to see results for more iterations so that the trends become clear. The differences between different runs are very small, so the authors should run multiple experiments with different random seeds to reduce the effect caused by randomness.

However, as pointed out below, I was not able to verify all steps of the proofs."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**Clarity.** I am a bit puzzled by the use of $\\succcurlyeq$ for matrices. When you write $\\Sigma \\succcurlyeq 0$, I suppose it is the usual condition for Sigma to be positive definite and not that each individual element of sigma should be larger than zero. This would rule out certain covariance matrices. On the other hand, the authors write $\\nabla^2 f = H_f \\preccurlyeq -\\alpha I_d$, comparing two matrices (supposing that $I_d$ is the $d$-dimensional unit matrix). I suppose that it now constrains each element. Can the authors please clarify?\n\nMeasures: What is meant by precision and recall in the evaluation section? Is there a discriminator deployed that tries to differentiate between the real and fake samples? This needs to be clarified. I don\u2019t currently see how generative models can have recall/precision.\n\n**Clarity of the Proofs.** Unfortunately, some proofs in the paper offer room for improvement of clarity and were inaccessible for verification in their current form. For instance:\nIn appendix A.1., I can follow the proof of Lemma 1 and Lemma 2. However, it is not obvious how equation (13) implies the form of $\\alpha(n)$ using the $\\Gamma$-function. This should necessarily be clarified as there is not a word on how the form of $\\alpha(n)$ comes into play.\n\n**Some assumptions made in this work may not reflect reality well and may be oversimplifying.** While I know that certain assumptions are required to make the problem amenable to theoretical analysis, I have concerns that they may be overly restrictive in practice. In particular, we basically assume convexity of the loss function through assumption 1 and 2. As far as I can see, due to the Lipschitz constant on the Hessian being L (assumption 1) and the Hessian's eigenvalues being smaller than $-\\alpha$ (interpreting the operator that way, please correct me in case this is not correct), in the ball of $\\epsilon = \\alpha/L$ around $\\theta^*$, the Hessian will be negative definite, implying convexity. As the Theorems only state the existence of a radius $\\delta > 0$ in which the convergence properties hold, we basically consider the convex part of the problem. As we know, modern loss landscapes are far from convex. It is highly unlikely that both the initial value and the optimum $\\theta^*$ lie in a ball in which the loss function is convex.\nAnother impractical assumption may be the assumption of no approximation error. This is usually only shown for infinite-parameter models. I would be fine with these approximations if the empirical results would confirm the assumptions and the analysis that follows from them. However the evaluation results seem to rather confirm the doubts.\n\n**The evaluation does not confirm the claims.** As far as I can tell, the point of departure for this work is as follows: Previous works [1,2] have already established that model training on solely generated data is unstable or collapses. On the other hand, training models again and again on the same dataset is stable (otherwise the models we currently have wouldn\u2019t work at all, as they are trained epoch by epoch with the same data). The key claim of this work is therefore that there is some value $\\lambda > 0$, i.e., a certain amount of generated data can be injected, such that model training remains stable. \n\nUnfortunately, the experimental results are not very convincing in that regard. Indeed, the leftmost column of Figure 3 shows that the resulting FID curve is almost a linear interpolation between $\\lambda=0$ (stable) and $\\lambda=1$ (unstable). This suggest that for every $\\lambda>0$ training will be diverge in the end. Even for the smaller lambdas, we see that the training FID gradually increases. For \\lambda=0.001, I guess one would require more than 5 steps of training to observe a statistically significant effect (as we are discussion the case of infinite retraining). Furthermore, there are no measures of disparity (e.g., standard deviations) displayed, would could solidify the empirical evaluation.\n\n**Minor points**\n\nRelated work: I am aware of the fact that the studied problem is different from mode collapse in generative models, but I have the impression that there seem to be some connections. Maybe the authors can add a discussion on this point.\n\nWrite-up: Missing parenthesis in the last line of before the statement of the contributions \u201c(DDPM\u2026\u201d\n\nLast point of the contribution section: \u201cUsing two powerful diffusion models in DDPM and EDM\u201d (\u201cin\u201d seems unexpected at this place)\nThere are many unclarities in the proofs:\n\n\u201cSince most methods are local search method[s]\u201d (use the plural form here)\n\nProof in Appendix C. There are some formatting errors below eqn. 33. (theta is not properly displayed). \n\nProof in Appendix D. Equation (39) theta\u2019 is multiply defined, first by the outer quantor, then below the max after the $\\leq$ sign. Consider using $\\theta\u2019\u2019$ or similar in this case.\n\n\nThe PDF seems to render very slowly. Maybe the authors can check some of the vector graphics again to increase the overall accessibility.\n\n**Summary:** Overall, this is an interesting work. While I do not contest the main results, I was not able to verify all proofs either as I wasn\u2019t able to follow the arguments at some points. Furthermore, the empirical evaluation is almost contradictory to the theoretical claims in this paper. I will be willing to increase my rating to an accept-score, if the authors can clarify their proofs such that the validity of their results can be easily verified and convincingly show that values of $\\lambda>0$ exist, where stable retraining is possible for a larger amount of retraining iterations (5 iterations are insufficient when considering an infinite regime).\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\n**References**\n\n[1] S.
