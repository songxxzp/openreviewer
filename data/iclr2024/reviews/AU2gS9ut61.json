Compared to classic simulators for biological neural networks, models implemented in BrainPy benefit from auto-differentiation, and compared to standard machine learning frameworks, BrainPy provides an environment focused on building bio-inspired models with e.g. spiking interactions and detailed synaptic/neuronal dynamics."

In biological networks, the (local) connectivity is typically significantly more dense, with hundreds or thousands of synapses per neuron."

Is this a clear disadvantage as compared to, e.g., NEURON? Does the compilation speed depend on whether CPU or GPU are used? How does it scale with the number of neurons?\n\n2) In section 4.2, the authors claim that there method is significantly more memory-efficient than others. Maybe I am misunderstanding this, but: do the gains that the authors claim here stem from an assumption that the connectivity matrix is low-rank? How else would they possibly be able to store connections of 86 Billion neurons?\n\nMinor: \n\n1) I believe that it would be good if the authors clarified that all JIT capabilities are due to the fact that brainpy relies on JAX, and are not implemented from scratch. Section 4.5 reads as if the authors implemented this themselves.\n\n2) The statement `It is important to note that this hierarchical composition property is not shared by other brain simulators.` is not true, see for example NetPyNE."
