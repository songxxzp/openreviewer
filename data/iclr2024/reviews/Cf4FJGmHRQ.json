                "value": "The paper presents a novel solution named PAC-FNO for image recognition, demonstrating the ability to simultaneously handle images of varying resolutions and resist the impact of various types of input-induced natural variations within a singular model in recognition tasks. The proposed parallel-structured and all-component Fourier neural operator (PAC-FNO), building on the resolution invariance of FNOs in the frequency domain, notably eliminates the ideal low-pass filter found in vanilla FNOs. Additionally, it transforms the traditional serial architectures into a parallel structure, thereby considering a broader range of frequency components, retaining high-frequency details, and notably enhancing performance, especially in fine-grained datasets. The proposed approach introduces a two-stage training method that fine-tunes pre-trained image recognition models in conjunction with PAC-FNO, allowing the acquisition of commonalities among various input resolutions with minimal modifications to the backbone classification network. Through conducted experiments, the authors effectively showcase the performance of PAC-FNO, significantly improving accuracy in comparison to existing baseline models. The manuscript is well-written, and the experiments conducted are comprehensive and convincingly articulated."

Although neural network operators based on the Fourier domain transformation for learning, due to their excellent characteristics in resolution invariance, have been recognized and applied in various areas, especially for enhancing pre-processing operators in variable-resolution input networks. However, the authors, motivated by the rational desire to retain high-frequency image details, proposed for the first time to eliminate the inherent low-pass filters in the model. Additionally, they introduced a popular parallel structure similar to Multi-head Self-Attention, further enhancing the network's performance while expanding the design philosophy of relevant operators.\n\n2. The presentation of this paper is professional and fluent. It has almost no expression errors and clearly elucidates the authors' contributions.\n\n3. The paper conducted extensive and meticulous experiments, utilizing seven image recognition benchmark datasets and applying the operators to four different backbone networks. The authors closely follow the cutting-edge developments in the field, employing more advanced VIT and ConvNeXt for experimentation, which makes the results highly persuasive."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Although the author compared super-resolution (SR) models for variable resolution inputs, the compared SR models are outdated and lack representation across various upscaling factors for super-resolution reconstruction. The field of super-resolution has seen significant advancements recently; thus, it is recommended to select more appropriate comparative algorithms.\n\n2. The primary advantage of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) lies in their use of frequency domain processing for resolution invariance. As a learnable enhancement operator, it's expected to exhibit some resilience to input natural variations. However, the author hasn't provided a detailed and explanatory analysis of the mechanisms where the operator shows robustness against natural variations. Moreover, the chosen input variations in the experiments, like fog, brightness, spatter, and saturate, represent basic degradation scenarios that can be addressed without deep learning methods. Therefore, regarding resilience to input natural variations, this might not be sufficiently emphasized as a highlight of the paper. The paper suggests exploring degradation in real-world scenarios in future work, indicating that the authors are aware of the limitations in terms of experimental performance or the algorithm proposed. However, such scenarios represent fundamental problems studied in the field of Image Recognition (IR) and hold significant practical application implications. Actually, certain degradation processes might affect high or low frequency details in the image's frequency domain. For instance, blur involves the loss of high-frequency details, prompting the author to conduct a mechanistic analysis combining frequency domain and degradation processes to enhance this aspect's interpretability.\n\n3. The original intent behind the existence of ideal low-pass filters was to reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity. While the author's innovative design to remove the inherent low-pass filter is intuitively comprehensible, the associated trade-offs are not discussed in the manuscript. It would be beneficial to provide supplementary explanations to demonstrate the worthiness of such a modification.\n\n4. The experiments thoroughly prove the advantages of parallel architectures and claim that this approach encapsulates more frequency components. However, they lack further detailed explanations and justifications."

By operating in the frequency domain, PAC-FNO is able to learn the semantics of images in various resolutions and/or natural variations for challenging image recognition with a single model. The proposed PAC-FNO is capable of handling both low-resolution and input variations typically observed in low-quality images with a single model. It can also be attached to a downstream visual recognition model, which is beneficial for handling multiple input variations at once and minimizing the changes in the downstream model during fine-tuning. In the evaluation with four visual recognition models and seven datasets, the proposed PAC-FNO achieves excellent performance."

What caused this phenomenon to occur? Is your method also unfriendly to other Transformer methods?\n3. The ideal low-pass filter in the FNO block removes detailed image signals that play an important role in classification in the fine-grained dataset. Is this conclusion applicable to Transformer based image classification methods? More quantitative results should be provided to confirm the universality of the proposed method.\n4.
