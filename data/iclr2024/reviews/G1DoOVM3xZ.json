Intuitively, stochastic policies should have better exploartion ability than deterministic policies and should be preferred more in deployment efficienct learning setting. There are also several closely related works ([1] and [2]) have reported that when the algorithm can deploy stochastic or even non-Markovian policies at each iteration, the lower bound of deployment complexity would be $\\Omega(H)$ and can be matched.\n\n   However, such clarification is missing and those closely related works are also not mentioned in the paper. I would suggest the authors clarify about this issue somewhere in the introduction and include the discussion with those related works in the paper.\n\n2. It is not very clear to me what the main novelty in technique analysis and innovations in algorithm design in this paper. There are lots of places \"inspired by ...(some previous work)\" in this paper, and it's not clear what are the novel parts and what are ingredients from previous work.\n\n3.

The new lower bound looks interesting, and my main concern is addressed, so I decide to raise my score.
