They formalize predictive (actions dependent on treatment effect) and prognostic expertise (actions dependent on potential outcomes) and argue that knowledge of the type of expertise provides a useful inductive bias for selection of a treatment effect estimation method. They further show that the type of expertise present in a dataset can be estimated observationally with a plug-in method, suggesting a meta-algorithm whereby the type of expertise is estimated and the more appropriate method chosen. Experiments are conducted with sweeps over the amount of each type of expertise in the data. The results have implications particularly for the appropriateness of methods that learn balancing representations, as these are shown to worse than other methods in cases with predictive expertise (as the balancing removes information about the treatment effect from the representation) and better than other methods in cases with prognostic expertise (as the shifts present are unrelated to the treatment effect)."

What are the specific advantages of entropy in capturing the nuances of expert decision-making, and under what conditions does it outperform simpler measures like variance?\n\n2. The consideration of domain expert knowledge in personalized decision-making problems is crucial but challenging, especially given that such expertise may not always be accurate or easily discernible in real data sets. How might one effectively balance the integration of domain knowledge with data-driven insights to mitigate the risk of relying on potentially inaccurate expertise? Is there a methodology within your framework that utilizes data-driven approaches to validate and calibrate the contributions of domain expertise, particularly through the lens of prognostic and predictive expertise measures?\n\n3. In the context of clinical trials, where treatment assignments are typically randomized and propensity scores are uniformly distributed. Then, the application of expert knowledge is less straightforward. Considering such scenarios, how do the proposed prognostic and predictive expertise metrics maintain their utility? Can these metrics still provide meaningful information for personalized treatment recommendations when the baseline assumption of expert influence on treatment assignment is removed?
