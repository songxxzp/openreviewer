In the paper, the authors propose to use audio reflections to recover the floorplan of an environment. The idea is different to previous methods and sounds very interesting.\n\n2.\tRobust solution. Predicting the indoor map from only audio reflections is very challenging due to limited and sometimes noisy information in the audio reflections. Therefore, the authors introduce the Hint map to recover a coarse geometry of an area according to the time of receiving responses. The Hint map then is used to replace original signals as the input to cGAN, making results more accurate and robust.\n\n3.\tIndividual room estimation. It is really difficult to recover the whole area all at once, so recovering one room individually and stitching rooms into floorplan with known locations should give better results."

                "value": "1.\tLimitation. My major concern is the limitation of the idea. Audio signals contain much less information than visual or lidar signals for map reconstruction, which means the floorplan generated from audio reflections are not that accurate as also shown in the experiments. Moreover, audio reflections vary in environments with different painting materials, decorations, and objects in the area. These factors may further impair the accuracy and generalization.\n\n2.\tPose accuracy. In the paper, the location is obtained from IMU. However, IMU is very sensitive to error accumulation especially in large rooms. Currently, as GPS is not available in indoor environments, visual information is the best to obtain location information. My concern is that if we have visual information, why don\u2019t we just recover an accurate map with SfM techniques from images? Note that audio reflections only provide very coarse floorplan.\n  \n3.\tApplications of floorplan contour. In Section 1, the authors mention that \u2018a simple floorplan contour may suffice in most cases\u2019 but don\u2019t provide examples. Maps reconstructed by cameras and Lidars can be used for localization which is the key technique to AR/VR and robotics navigation. It is not very clear to see how to use floorplan contour in real applications."

I would imagine the application is expected to not operate in the audible range, please correct me on this if I'm wrong.\n\n- Results in Section 4.1 is unclear. What does the HintMap baseline indicate? Isn't Hint map part of the MapLearn method? If so, what are the contribution of the rest of the components (ablations)?\n- Question about the metrics and visualizations, the paper does not motivate why the improvement matters. \n   - If an approximate floorplan suffices for downstream application(s), does the improvement in P(d) and R(d) matter? \n   - It's difficult to interpret images in Fig 10, I'm not sure if Row 2 is better than Row 3 or vice versa.\n\n- Demonstrating an application where a more accurate floorplan from audio is needed would be useful in showing the benefit of the improvement in floorplan estimate (as the goal is anyways to obtain an approximate floorplan)."
