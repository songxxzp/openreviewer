The name of pseudo-gloss pretraining is a bit confusing, although the method itself is sound. Because the pseudo-glosses are in spoken language order, it is not quite appropriate to call them \"glosses\".\n\n3. The notations of \"P\", \"F\", \"D\" in Table 2 and 3 are also confusing. For example, D denotes without pretraining and P denotes pretraining, then what does \"P+D\" mean? I suggest authors adding a \"check mark\" column to show which parts are pretrained.\n\n4. I cannot find an ablation study on the pseudo-gloss pretraining. What is the performance if removing it?\n\n5. In Table 4, removing sinusoidal positional encoding leads to the best performance. Then what poistional encoding is used by default?\n\n6. The paper uses a new spatial backbone which is under-explored in previous sign language papers. The authors need to better motivate it. For example, is it better than other vision transformers, or is it better than widely adopted 2D/3D CNNs?\n\n7. In figure 2, how to fuse the outputs of adapted masked attention (solid lines) and zero-gated cross attention (dashed lines)? Besides, what is adapted masked attention?

It's unclear whether the improvements are really from the proposed modeling and pretraining strategy. Could you please add further ablations regarding the size of GPT models? \n2) The sign encoder and pseudo-gloss pretraining take a crucial role in the proposed method, but analysis and ablation regarding them are insufficient. \n  - Do we need the sign encoder? What if dropping it? \n  - Apart from the visual analysis, what about the top-N prediction accuracy and recall?\n3) Please also add gloss-based SOTA systems in Tables 2 and 3 so that readers can understand the gap.\n4) In Eq (1), you mentioned that V represents keys from textual features while K originates from sign features. Shouldn't they both come from sign features?\n5) How did you set the rank in LoRA?\n6) While Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily are popular, they are less significant due to limited vocabulary and data size.
