While this model is justified and used for practical reasons, the results might not be universally applicable to all language models, which could limit the generalizability of the findings.\n\nLimited Discussion of Social Implications: Given the paper's focus on mitigating potential harms from generative language models, it would be beneficial to include a more extensive discussion of the social implications of watermarking and other detection methods.

The analysis will be more complete if it includes more recent and advanced post-hoc detection methods (such as RADAR https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03838), because DetectGPT is known to be non-robust to paraphrasing. I would like to see the result of RADAR in ROC analysis and with varying token lengths."

For the analysis of post-hoc detection, given that DetectGPT is shown to be fragile against paraphrasing (Sadasivan 2023), can the authors add a new analysis with a more robust post-hoc AI-text detector, like RADAR? I would like to see the result of RADAR in ROC analysis and with varying token lengths, as in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.\n\n2. I don't see much discussion on the utility of the studied watermark methods (especially the new one, SelfHash). if a watermark is robust but lacks usefulness, it is impractical. Can the authors report the usefulness of the new watermark methods that have been not studied in (Kirchenbauer 2023)?"

The watermark hides with high probability in high-entropy token sequences, such as names, locations, and numbers. Is a paraphraser allowed to replace these with random other names and locations, or would that be considered \"unsuccessful\" paraphrasing?
