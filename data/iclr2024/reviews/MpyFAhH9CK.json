It is unclear whether the proposed simulator and benchmark is a good model of reality. Is it modeling a specific robot or class of robots? Could there be some experiments to show the validity of the simulator? I'm not necessarily referring to simulation to reality transfer, but rather to show that the simulator dynamics are correlated with the dynamics of a real robot.\n2. The proposed hierarchical reinforcement learning approach is relatively standard. Its application to the problem of morphology-changing robots might be new, though. \n3. I don't understand the reasoning behind the proposed baselines. There seem to be other approaches that are more related to the problem (e.g. Phatak et al., Learning to Control Self-Assembling Morphologies: A Study of Generalization via Modularity; Whitman et al., Learning Modular Robot Control Policies). Having a more detailed comparison could give a better idea of how difficult is the proposed benchmark for current algorithms.\n\nMinor points:\n1. Why are these tasks selected? What exactly is it that they evaluate? Why is it important to have them instead of others?\n2. I am not sure I understand how the baseline of Neural Field Policy is implemented and whether this is a novel contribution of the paper or some other work proposed before for this problem.\n3. I don't think Fig. 6 is helpful, the concept it represents is trivial and easily explained in a sentence"

In the appendix, the paper briefly explains that the core framework is based on existing works SAC and Nature CNN with minor modifications, but it is unclear how to reproduce the full approach.\n\n- Given the concern above, the theoretical novelty seems not high, as the main theoretical novelty of CFP is the introduction of adding residual action to coarse action.\n\n- The paper lacks comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods. The experiments only evaluate the performance of two ablation baseline methods and one NFP method. More comparisons will be appreciated. Besides the evaluation metric on reward, if more metrics can be used to evaluate real-robot applications, it will be appreciated, such as the successful rate or time efficiency.\n\n- As one of the main challenges proposed to address in this paper, the justification of lifetime adaptation is insufficient in the experiments. For example, if the approach can adapt to noise or actuator failures during the lifetime operation?\n\n- Even though the simulation experiments are impressive, there is still a gap between applying the proposed work to real-world robots, as shown in the demo video.
