Empirical results further justify the insights of theory, as the presented method is optimal among all generative codecs considered.\n4.

Also, there are images released from the work of (Agustsson, 2022), which are not included in the paper.\n2. The x-domain constraint seems identical to that of (Hoogeboom, 2023).\n3. The paper uses a third-party implementation of HiFiC with a different training set that may give divergent results from the original paper. The authors of the HiFiC paper have made their models available at https://github.com/tensorflow/compression.\n4. Only two metrics are considered: FID and PSNR. Most other compression works include more metrics, such as LPIPS, to gauge model performance across a variety of axes.\n\nThe proposed method uses much more compute than its competitors, and it has limited image resolutions. However, I am not counting this is as a negative for my review, because this is clearly stated already in the manuscript."

The failures of many of the generative models to give good results suggests a divergence between theory in practice, i.e., although the theory suggests any unconditional generator will do, the generators that we have available to us and their various samplers exhibit widely different properties. Did the authors consider discussing this in the Discussion?\n2. Could you clarify why you used the OASIS FID implementation as opposed to the FID/256 method that is more standard in the compression community?\n3. The rate-distortion-perception tradeoff is portrayed in a confusing way in Figure 8 of the Appendix. Is the reason that you could not match bpps between methods as done in Figure 1 of (Muckley, 2023)?\n4. Would you consider to use language other than \"perception\" to describe distributional divergence? \"Perception\" is an overloaded term in the compression community and does not intuitively describe the phenomena of the paper. Although it is true that \"perception\" is the term of Blau/Michaeli to describe divergence phenomena, others in the community have adopted more specific teams such as \"realism\" or \"statistical fidelity\" that lead to less confusion with human perception."

The conclusion would be unintuitive before I successfully follow all the derivations in this paper. In fact, the derivations in this paper are not difficult. Theorems 1&2 well summarize the main conclusions of this paper. If there is no technical errors regarding the derivations (at least I didn't find), the proposed idea in this paper, i.e., using generative model inversion to improve perceptual image compression (Section4.1), may form a new paradigm in this field, which is sound in theory and useful in practice. The pratical implementation can be summarized as: first use pretrained generative models to produce an image $\\hat{X}$ and encode it into $f_0(\\hat{X})$, then constrain the idempotence between $f_0(\\hat{X})$ and Y using gradient descent-based inversion. These steps are easy to implement with a pretrained codec and a pretrained unconditional generative model.\n\nExperimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of this idea. Also, the presentation of this paper is great. Overall, I would be happy to accept this paper although I have two major concerns as written in the weaknesses part."

For example, now the authors are using DDPM with 1000 steps. There are some latest unconditional generative models largely reducing the number of generation steps.   \n(2) The issue regarding the image resolution should be paid with more attention. We can imagine that the gradient descent-based inversion would be hard to be implemented on high-resolution images. In the experimental section of this paper, it is stated like \"central crop image by their short edge and rescale them to 256 \u00d7 256\", which means almost all experiments are performed on this scale. On the one hand, some baseline models are trained for high-resolution generation or generative compression, and it may be unfair to directly compare with their pretrained models. On the other hand, it implies that the current method is hard to be applied to high-resolution images without cropping."

However, the result at 0.11 bpp seems to be weird, which is definitely what we do not want in practice. Is there is potential solution or idea to solve this issue?"
