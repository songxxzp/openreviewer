In Section 4.3, the paper claims that the OOD state-actions can harm the performance of online fine-tuning. Wouldn\u2019t the collected online data, that contain reward signals, enhance the data support of the offline dataset? \n\n- There is a lack of clear explanation towards the unique challenges in the exploration-exploitation of the offline-to-online problem. For instance, a major issue could be the \u201cforgetting\u201d - during the model updates  the fine-tuned policy can quickly forget what it has learned from offline, which is neglected by this work.\n\n- The motivation and evaluation are isolated. In the Introduction, the paper claims \u201cthe proposed method provides a generic solution for offline-to-online RL to enable finetuning agents pretrained with different offline RL objectives.\u201d However, in the experiment, the tuning policy is pretrained from the same task."

It also employs an optimistic exploration strategy to select actions with both high value and uncertainty, facilitating efficient exploration.

The authors propose the SUNG (simple unified uncertainty guided) framework to work on top of most model-free offline RL algorithms & evaluate the approach with CQL & TD3+BC as base algorithms. Since a key limitation when moving from offline to online learning is the conservatism that hinders collection of new data, the algorithm employs the concept of optimism in the face of uncertainty so that the policy should in the online phase choose actions that have both high value and high uncertainty. Since the distribution shift induced by this exploration scheme makes value estimation harder and can hinder learning, an adaptive uncertainty guided exploitation scheme is introduced, which regularizes the policy based on the samples' OOD-ness.\nThe empirical evaluation compares SUNG with two base algorithms against multiple other baselines on D4RL tasks and finds SUNG to outperform prior works substantially."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I find the formulation of the SUNG framework a bit counterintuitive: The authors mention that they want to have high-uncertainty actions, yet at the same time they only sample \"near-on-policy actions for exploration\", which appears contradicting. Further, during the optimization / policy improvement part (green arrows in fig 1), the same percentage p of the batch is always labeled as OOD, which is not consistent, since the absolute uncertainty value at which a sample could be labeled OOD can vary (it could even be the case that the same sample is sometimes OOD and sometimes not, depending on the other samples in the batch).\n\nGenerally, I have a bit of an issue with the additional OOD detection in the adaptive exploitation - the regularizer in offline RL algorithms is mostly already doing OOD detection (often also based on some measure of uncertainty), so it should already automatically detect low and high uncertainty samples and thus assign low or high regularization accordingly. While this is normally not done in such a binary nature, I don't see how the adaptive exploitation scheme is not doing pretty much the same thing again. It seems to just amplify the regularization tendency that is already there. The emperical ablation in fig 2d shows it to be important, but to me it is unclear why that is the case - is the normal regularization simply not yet enough? or is the VAE based OOD detection in some qualitative way better than the base algorithms own regularization?\n\nIn the exploration scheme, where actions are ranked & selected based on value and then sampled based on uncertainty (or the other way around), you mention the possibility to adapt the trade-off preference between value and uncertainty - what do you mean by that? Would you adaptively change the trade-off during the training process or is it something you set in advance (and based on what information)? I'm also not sure whether you mention which way around you ended up doing filtering + sampling (first value or first uncertainty or maybe some combination) and why.\n\nIn the empirical evaluation I'm assuming you report final performances (i.e. after the 100k environment steps). Prior works that you mention (like Cal-QL, AWAC) have shown that during O2O, algorithms commonly suffer from immediate performance drops right after online learning starts due to distribution drift - it would be extremely interesting to see how SUNG performs in this context, which is why another performance metric reporting during the beginning of online learning could be useful or directly plotting the test returns over training time.\n\nI believe some other prior works that are currently not contained should also be considered in the related work section:\n\n[1] Swazinna, P., Udluft, S., & Runkler, T. (2021). Overcoming model bias for robust offline deep reinforcement learning.\u00a0Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (EAAI),\u00a0104.\n\n[2] Ghosh, D., Ajay, A., Agrawal, P., & Levine, S. (2022). Offline rl policies should be trained to be adaptive. ICML 2022\n\n[3] Hong, J., Kumar, A., & Levine, S. (2022). Confidence-Conditioned Value Functions for Offline Reinforcement Learning. ICLR 2023\n\n[4] Swazinna, P., Udluft, S., & Runkler, T. (2022). User-Interactive Offline Reinforcement Learning. ICLR 2023\n\n[1] introduces MOOSE, which is a model-based offline RL method that uses a VAE as a regularizer. While your adaptive exploitation scheme is using it in a different way, I still believe it should be mentioned. The works [2-4] are also concerned with offline to online learning, just that their online phase is a little shorter and their adaptations thus look a little different than the one you consider. Still, when thinking about O2O they are closely related and should be considered.\n\nMore a sidenote: Fig. 2b is labeled \"Optimistic Exploration without Uncertainty\". As far as I understand, this method is greedily selecting best actions based on value - it is unclear to me how that is optimistic (i.e. optimisim in the face of what) so maybe the different ablations should be named more clearly.\n\nI realize the weakness section is a bit lengthy, but I think your paper has merits and I am prepared to increase the score if you are able to address my concerns."
