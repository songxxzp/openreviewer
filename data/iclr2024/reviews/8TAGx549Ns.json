Two approaches are proposed:\n1) Planning full trajectories and using upper confidence bound (UCB) scores to guide the selection of actions from the sequence\n\t- Uses in-context learning as the mechanism to update model action reward estimates\n\t- Feedback is provided to the LLM by labeling prompt actions as high or low reward\n2) Planning at the level of individual actions and using UCB to reweight predicted token logits for different actions\n\nThree algorithms are proposed (a variant of the first approach uses only raw rewards, rather than UCB scores) and evaluated on a block arrangement task and grade school mathematics problems. The proposed algorithms are compared with two baselines from the literature and found to have higher accuracy in some tasks. The new algorithm is shown to have favorable time complexity compared to three baselines."

The performance improvements are primarily for (some) small Blocksworld domains, with comparable performance on GSM8K. This makes it unclear to what degree the algorithm is an improvement over existing methods.\n\nBenchmarking is only done on relatively simple example tasks, making it difficult to assess how well these results translate to real world use cases.\n\nEvaluation does not match techniques on the number of tokens they generate or evaluation calls they make. This makes fair comparisons impossible, as the different methods are afforded different computational budgets for the same objective.\n\n# clarity\nThe text can be hard to follow. Partially this is due to framing the technique as reinforcement learning, despite the lack of a policy being learned (though presumably the MCTS count tables could be preserved and treated as a learned policy of sorts). The core algorithm description was difficult to follow and the main figures did not support understanding this algorithm.\n\n# significance\nThe results do not show substantial improvements over prior efforts, limiting the significance attributable to the technical novelties."

If the authors emphasize the better computational complexity of their proposed method, they may want to add rigorous theoretical analysis.\n\n- The ideas presented in this paper are quite similar to Tree-of-Thoughts (Yao et al., 2023).

This part should be $\\forall (s,a) \\in S \\times A$.\n    - Algorithm 1, line 14: $\\forall (s,a) \\in H$. $H$ is a time step.\n- The overall alogrithmic flow is not clear to me.

In addition to the math problems mentioned earlier, the algorithmic flow in this paper is hard to follow."
