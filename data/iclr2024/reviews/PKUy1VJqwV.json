Specifically, authors deem an existing SSL pre-trained graph encoder as teacher, and employ multiple students to acquire discriminative representations on different granularities guided by the teacher. On downstream tasks, the students are separately fine-tuned and their predictions are linearly combined as the final output. The proposed framework is shown to be able to improve six existing graph SSL algorithms on molecular graph and PPI graph modeling."

Such heuristic method can hardly capture the intrinsic semantic structures underlying the pre-training dataset. By comparison, the prototype number determination scheme explored in [a] can better discover such structure in a learnable way. Can authors justify their prototype number selection scheme against such method with some theoretical or empirical results?\n2. **Visualization of learned prototypes**: Authors are suggested to show the semantic prototypes learned for both molecular graphs and PPI graphs. Such visualization can help to understand the learning mechanism of the proposed method. \n\n\n[a] Allen, Kelsey, et al. \"Infinite mixture prototypes for few-shot learning.\" International conference on machine learning.

This brings forth concerns regarding the novelty and distinctiveness of the paper's central contribution. While adapting this approach to the context of GNNs is commendable, it seems that the crux of the innovation might be largely credited to the ProtoNCE loss itself.\n\nThe structure of the paper, particularly in Section 4, lacks comprehensive detail. With only two pages dedicated to the methodology, certain aspects remain unclear. For instance, the authors mention the construction of \"K sets of corresponding trainable prototypes\" but do not elucidate how these prototypes are updated. This omission leaves room for ambiguity and confusion.\n\nThe experimental results, while positive, do not offer a comprehensive comparison with other fine-tuning methods, which would have provided a clearer picture of MGSE's relative advantages."

So why not choose the best model for the downstream task but use an ensemble? It is essential to consider the possibility that combining models with varying levels of granularity might introduce conflicting or inconsistent information, leading to a negative impact on the overall performance of the downstream task. A thorough analysis and experimentation on the ensemble's potential drawbacks and benefits are warranted to address this concern."

To this end, the authors propose a plug-and-play graph knowledge distillation framework (MGSE), which can integrate with existing graph self-supervised learning models and enhance model performance by incorporating multi-granularity concepts. Specifically, under the condition of probability distributions at different granularities, MGSE captures multi-granularity knowledge by making multiple student models learn from a single teacher model. Extensive results on several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MGSE improves the performance of existing graph self-supervised learning models. The ablation experiments also demonstrated the effectiveness of the techniques employed in MGSE.\n\nIn summary, this work makes the following contributions: Firstly, it proposes a plug-and-play knowledge distillation framework to enhance the generalization of any graph-based self-supervised learning model. Based on empirical experimental results, the framework demonstrates promising performance, and the authors provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of MGSE."

                "value": "While overall this work does not have major flaws, I still have some concerns as follows and I hope the authors to address them as much as possible.\n1. Although the authors have designed different student models based on the analysis to capture knowledge at different granularities for solving various downstream tasks, it is important to visually demonstrate the distinct granularities of knowledge captured by each student model, rather than solely asserting that \u201cdifferent prototype sets capture different semantic granularities because we assign different numbers of prototypes to each prototype set in descending order\u201d. The authors should consider adding a case study to provide a better explanation, like the mentioned example in the introduction about which knowledge in amino acids is coarse-grained and which knowledge is fine-grained.\n\n2. In this paper, the framework captures multi-granular knowledge and performs an averaging operation on the outputs of different student models. However, since different datasets may lean towards different granularities of knowledge, it is worth considering whether the introduction of fine-grained knowledge in datasets where coarse-grained knowledge dominates could potentially be not only irrelevant to the target task but also introduce noise. Taking document classification as an example, capturing high-level textual features may be sufficient, and the fine-grained semantic features may not provide substantial assistance in determining the category of the document.\n\n3. If I haven't missed any important details, as far as I know, the model ensemble can also lead to performance improvement. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether the performance improvement comes from capturing knowledge at different granularities or is simply a result of the model ensemble strategy.\n\n4. From the results, it can be observed that the designed framework brings some improvement, but this improvement comes at the cost of ensemble of multiple models. Additionally, although the authors have indicated that the proposed framework's computational complexity is proportional to the existing graph self-supervised models, considering the significant computational complexity of the original graph-based self-supervised models, it is uncertain whether this trade-off is worthwhile."
