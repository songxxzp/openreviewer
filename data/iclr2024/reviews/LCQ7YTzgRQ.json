This analysis is done concerning three types of models: node-independent, fully independent, and node-independent models. The paper also introduces new generative models.

First, it is good to have a formalization for independence, independence that is not reliant on the mechanics of the generative model and thus could be applicable in a broader sense. However, this is not totally new as there are existing approaches such as exchangeability (node and edge) that provide insights concerning sampling order. Another interesting aspect of the paper is the idea of linking (in the theorems) the expected number of triangles with the overlap of two sampled graphs (expected number of shared edges). This could be very useful to provide greater control in clique generation on synthetic graphs (which is what is evaluated in the paper as well) among other benefits. A third interesting contribution is the proposed models. Although more clarity could be beneficial to the generative process. More specifically, the process of association probabilities to the locations within the graph (either adjacency matrix, locations, or edge lists) needs to be spelled out and better described."

These seem to be very loose and it is hard to see how these can be used in practice, or even to provide insight about how to structure the generative process. Given this subtlety, something that could facilitate seeing the applicability of the bounds would be to see some synthetic verifications but no experiments show the application of the bounds to verify their veracity of them. This issue is especially important for the case of edge-independent models (cubic in the product $n \\cdot Ov(\\mathcal A$)). Other things could be done to improve the paper. For instance, I think it is important to highlight the methodological complexity of using the bounds to achieve the target structure in the sampled graphs. Currently, Algorithm 1 has one line that describes MCDF and a couple that describes MCEI and MCNI while most of details are not fully detailed in the main body of the paper.  That is, as I mentioned before, the process of association probabilities to the locations within the graph could be further clarified. Finally, identifying cycles can be computationally expensive and a scalability analysis of the method could be useful."
