The pre-trained network acts as a foundational model, further finetuned for downstream atomic property prediction tasks. The authors\u2019 major contribution is demonstrating that by pretraining exclusively on small molecules, the network can be finetuned on large molecule datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results. The primary technical advancements concentrate on refining each component of the standard deep learning pipeline, including data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning. Experiments across 40 fine-tuning benchmarks are conducted to showcase the effectiveness of the method."

                "value": "- My primary concern lies in the paper\u2019s technical contribution. The concept of building a foundational model for molecular property prediction tasks isn\u2019t novel. A significant challenge is bridging the substantial domain gaps across various chemistry domains. The authors seem to emphasize that the proposed pipeline can effectively bridge the molecule size gap, allowing it to work efficiently on larger molecules even when only pretrained on smaller ones. However, molecule size is just one of several apparent factors\u2014and likely among the simpler ones\u2014causing the domain gap. More complex factors, such as intrinsic differences in the distribution of graph structures and issues related to data availability, are not addressed in the paper. Consequently, it is challenging to be convinced that the proposed method significantly contributes to foundational models or represents \"an important step for universal ML potential,\" as claimed in the introduction.\n\n- The improvement brought by the proposed method appears to be mainly attributed to hyperparameter tuning. The network architecture itself isn\u2019t novel, and the loss function closely resembles commonly used ones, albeit with slight modifications to some coefficients. My overarching impression is that the authors engage extensively in manual hyperparameter tuning, which doesn\u2019t offer substantial insights to propel further research advancements. While I acknowledge the empirical enhancements demonstrated through comprehensive experiments, it is still challenging to bestow a favorable overall evaluation on the paper."

                "value": "1. In Sect. 4.1, concerning Data Normalization, the authors have chosen to normalize the property values per dataset. A lingering question is how the output of the NN is transformed. Is the transformation still dependent on each specific dataset? If that is the case, it seems impractical for real world applications where a novel molecule is given, and it would be indeterminable as to which \"dataset\" it inherently belongs to and how to transform its output.\n\n2. Regarding Dataset Size Imbalance, I was wondering if the authors considered utilizing loss reweighting as opposed to data reweighting. By loss reweighting, I am referring to the approach of uniformly sampling the data but adjusting the coefficients of each sample to p_d (ensuring normalization across each batch).\n\n3. I devoted a significant amount of time attempting to digest whether each term in Eq.1 is a novel contribution or a previously introduced one. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide clearer definitions of each symbol used, elaborate more distinctly on the novel improvements introduced in this paper, and add a period to the end of the equation."
