                "value": "This paper evaluates the current state of research on label poisoning in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The authors point out that while noisy labels in machine learning have been extensively studied, the same cannot be said for graph-based data, especially in the context of adversarial label perturbations. The paper identifies evaluation pitfalls in existing literature, questioning the conclusions drawn about the robustness of GNNs against label poisoning. To address this, the authors delve into various attack strategies, explore the intricacies of loss functions, and aim to provide a more accurate understanding of GNN vulnerabilities."

                "value": "1. Unconvincing arguments, presentation ambiguity and self-contradiction: (1) Lot of arguments in this paper are not convincing. For example, it says \u201cThe first pitfall arises since all previous attacks evaluate on data splits with validation set size much larger than that of the training set (e.g. 500 validation vs 140 train nodes on Cora-ML in the default setting).\u201d Actually, this kind of data partitioning is practical in graph learning as model developers focus on training and validating datasets in the training phase. It is hard to say this is a pitfall. (2) A lot of the statements are ambiguous. For example, it says \u201cWe observe that fine-tuning with only 20 configurations can significantly deteriorate the attack performance, as evidenced by an increase in test accuracy.\u201d The configurations are not explained clearly here. (3) Self-contradictive statement. In the beginning, it says that one drawback of related works is they focus on the binary task, however, they can be generalised to multiclass tasks, as shown in the evaluation part of this paper.\n2. Limited novelty. Although the research problem has been formulated, the proposed solutions have limited contribution. First, the method in section 4.1, only focuses on the liner GCN model, which ignores the non-linear property of most GNN models. The second method introduces a learning-based method to select nodes for flipping, however, the effectiveness will be limited by the expression ability of the surrogate model in the inner optimisation. Considering these limitations, existing methods can be adapted to the current setting, and unhighlighted research challenges in this paper, the novelty of the proposed methods is weak.\n3. Objective Presentations. Broad claims, especially critiques of an entire domain of literature, require comprehensive evidence and careful presentation to avoid potential overgeneralization. For example, the statement that the \"entire literature on label poisoning for GNNs is plagued by serious evaluation pitfalls\" is a strong assertion. From the segments I reviewed, there wasn't exhaustive and convincing evidence presented to substantiate such a broad critique. While the paper might delve deeper into this in sections I haven't extracted, from the available content, this claim appears to lack detailed supporting examples.\n\nA research paper's strength lies not just in its findings but also in the clarity and robustness of its evaluation methods. When critiquing other works for evaluation pitfalls, it becomes crucial for the paper to transparently outline its own methodology limitations. Considering these weaknesses in this paper, the authors are suggested to polish this paper carefully."

The paper first argues that major flaws exist in the evaluation of existing attacks against GNNs that needs to be resolved. These issues, such as the distribution of training/validation nodes and hyper-parameter selection, are related to faithfully considering the capabilities of defenders against such label poisoning attacks. The paper provides a critical evaluation of these pitfalls and demonstrate that they can have a significant effect on the performance of existing attacks. In the second part of the paper, two novel label poisoning attacks are introduced. The first one, called linear surrogate attack, uses a linear model as a surrogate for the models that one aims to attack. Then, a novel mixed-integer linear program is proposed to find the optimal solution for this attack. The second attack, dubbed meta attack, is motivated through the use of meta-learning for solving the bi-level optimization problem used for generating the label poisoning attack. Finally, the paper investigates the reasons behind superior performance of label poisoning attacks that only consider two classes to perform their flipping. Empirical and theoretical results for all the contributions are provided. Interestingly, the proposed linear surrogate attacks outperform all existing label poisoning attack baselines on both vanilla and defended GNNs."

At the moment, the paper just states that existing methods use considerably larger validation sets than training ones, but it doesn't go into the details of why this is a pitfall. Elaborating on the during the second paragraph of Section 3 is much appreciated."

Since I am not from this community, the proposed method seems a very natural formulation to conduct the label flip idea. Therefore, I am not sure whether the paper has enough novelty. Also, the formulation is also heavily based on the previous study and the proposed method is like a multi-label extension to me.\n3. Some pitfalls proposed are weird to me. I am not sure why the split between training, validation and test should be equal. As a semi-supervised learning task, it is usually to let them differ in my opinion and I am also not sure why the validation set should be poisoned as well since the validation set should be used to select model and do cross-validation."
