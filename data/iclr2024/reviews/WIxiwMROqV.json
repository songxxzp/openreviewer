CLAM is an extension of LRP methods such that it could be put on top to improve the performance of LRP approaches. For this, CLAM adds trainable parameters to the neural network such that LRP maps are guided by attributes (or prototypes) that are learned from data by the forward-forward algorithm. The generated explanations are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated using CUB."

If these concerns/questions can be clarified, I will reassess my scoring of the paper.\n\n1. Could the authors improve the understandability of Section 3? Right now, it is really difficult to read. I think the description would really benefit from the presentation of pseudo-code. Moreover, I recommend to revise the notations used. Using bold symbol for dimensions is rather untypical and confusing as bold symbols are usually used for matrices or tensors. Additionally, the notations between the appendix and the main paper should be aligned. Right now, they use different notations; the appendix uses 'sz_attrs' and so on. Furthermore, in Section 3.2 there are several repetitions of sentences. This should be fixed.\n2. Section 4.2.1: The first and the second paragraph are almost identical. Could the authors fix this?\n3. Is there a non-linear activation between the two 1x1 conv layers?\n4. Figure 2: How is the distance computed if P>A, and why is it strictly greater than?\n5. What size has D?\n6. Maybe I missed this in the paper: Why is the dimensionality of S \"+1\"?\n7. Section 3.3, ICP: How does such a matrix pattern look?\n8. Please note that Equation 1 consists of at least two disconnected equations, which should be fixed. Moreover, where is the index n in the lower right equation? Where is the index i in the upper equation (it is only an AvgPool without any dependence on i)? What is the meaning of \",:\" in the equations?\n9. Equation 2: What is $||\\cdot||$?\n10. What is \"Distance\" in Equation 3?\n11. Is the BCL loss or the Softplus function used as a loss function (see Section 3.3.)?\n12. If the authors want to compare the performance of explanations with respect to the localization properties, I recommend to use the following benchmark dataset: Leila Arras and Ahmed Osman and Wojciech Samek: CLEVR-XAI: A benchmark dataset for the ground truth evaluation of neural network explanations. Is there a reason why this dataset cannot be used?\n13. Section 4.2.1: How do the authors know that the background is always attributed to noise? Maybe the method highlights context information that is used. Same applies to later statements that are similar such as \"filters out areas irrelevant to the target.\"\n14. Could the authors elaborate on how to interpret/explain the decision process based on the derived maps? What changes if the map for the second highest prediction is considered? Does the map explain why the network hasn't decided for this class? In general, I recommend that the authors carefully refine their evaluation. An XAI method should help developers and users to understand the decision process of a network. This should go beyond presenting images that look reasonable (or satisfy the personal confirmation bias). The authors should challenge their XAI technique. For example, explain (using the maps) why a network makes certain errors or why it can be fooled by adversarial examples. Only presenting the images doesn't help in understanding the decision process. Since the authors haven't reported which predictions have been used, I guess they always present samples of correct predictions (note that the class label should be mentioned).\n15. What does removing mean in Section 4.2.1? Setting the values to 0?\n\nSome notes/comments to the authors, which I have not considered for the scoring:\n\n1. Please have you paper proofread by an English native speaker.\n2. Abstract: There is some weird character in \"Class-wise Layer-wise Attribute M\u00a1model (CLAM).\"\n3. Please use either $R^{(l)}_{2d}$ or $R^{(l)}{2d}$."

In addition, the baseline methods, i.e., LRP and Grad-CAM, used in Tables 1 & Figure 3 are proposed in 2015 and 2016 respectively. More recent methods should be considered as baselines, for example, \u201cOn locality of local explanation models, NeurIPS 2021\u201d, \u201cCraft: Concept recursive activation factorization for explainability, CVPR 2023\u201d, \u201cRKHS-SHAP: Shapley values for kernel methods, NeurIPS 2022\u201d.\n\n4.

I don't understand many sentences and paragraphs written in this paper and feel this is largely because the paper lacks a structure to clearly articulate its core development, the writing is unclear, and many of the key terms are never defined. \n\nFor example, I can't understand anything from this text: \"One approach generates contribution maps (or relevance maps), which use visualized internal model values to shed light on predictions. This method, however, is more about reverse-analyzing the model\u2019s decision-making rather than understanding the model itself, providing a \u2018visualization\u2019 rather than an \u2018explanation\u2019 for predictions\"\n\n\"Contribution maps\" (or relevance maps) was never defined in the paper, but this uses \"visualized internal model values\". What are the internal model values? Activation, gradients, saliency, etc. It must be something. This is about \"more about reverse-analyzing the model\u2019s decision-making rather than understanding the model itself\" -- then what do the authors mean by understanding the model itself other than analyzing the model's outputs? This is \"visualization\" not an \"explanation\". How do the authors define \"explanation\"? As far as I could tell, this paper defines \"relevance map/visualization\" = \"explanation\". \n\nAnother example is \"explainers\". I couldn't find the definition of this term while this term appears 51 times in the paper. I can only assume that this is something that gives us a relevance map. \n\nAnother example is \"attribute\". \"Attributes fundamentally extract sub-feature areas related to specific classes using features\". What is \"sub-feature?\" Attributes extract some areas, using features -- what features? Attributes are typically defined as semantics, i.e. word descriptions. Are there any semantics assigned for these attributes? \n\nSec 3.2 suddenly starts defining modules and their dimensions, but again, it is informal and I can't understand any of this without having a clear high level overview of the method. \n\nThe quantitative results show the proposed method doesn't quite improve the accuracy. The gain is at most 1.5% but it often even hurts the accuracy. I'm not convinced that this method is practically useful given the additional complexity added to the method."
