The main motivation of the authors is as follows. Due to the specific nature of stochastic AdaGrad-Norm, the existing techniques, used to analyse other stochastic or deterministic first-order methods, is inapplicable in this case. Firstly, they show that this method converges to max-margin solution almost surely. Secondly, they get the almost surely convergence rate of max-margin vector. To obtain these results authors assume, that the variance of the stochastic gradient is upper-bounded by squared norm of the full gradient, and if loss function is upper-bounded, then its stochastic gradient is also upper-bounded. This is a more general assumption, then existing assumption about regular sampling noise."

Furthermore, the technical contributions of the paper are nicely presented in the main part of the paper and they seem to admit an interesting technical depth (I have not checked the appendix in detail though).  Finally, the paper effectively extends the recent findings of [1] demonstrating that Adagrad norm converges towards a margin vector that however may not correspond to the maximum-margin solution.\n\n\n[1]  On the convergence of mSGD and AdaGrad for stochastic optimization, Jin et al., ICML 2022"

As far as I comprehend, Theorem 4.3 suggests that Stochastic Adagrad-Norm requires $O(2^{1/\\epsilon})$ iterations to converge to an $\\epsilon$-optimal solution for the respective logistic regression problem. Another less important concern pertains to the fact that the provided convergence results are based on the best-iterate rather than the last-iterate of Stochastic Adagrad Norm.\n\n\nMinor: There is room for improvement in terms of clarity in some sections of the paper. For instance, the presentation of the max-margin solutions could benefit from additional details and more formal definitions.

Are you aware of a first-order method that does not exhibit implicit bias to max-margin solutions in such linear classification problems?

In [1, 2], the implicit bias of the diagonal variant of AdaGrad depends on various factors such as initialization. Therefore, it is very surprising that the more complex normed version variant would have an implicit bias that do not depend on such conditions.\n\nThen, there are several extremely elementary mistakes:\n\n1. In the equation block in the \"Intuition of the theorem\" part of Section 4, what is the second gradient taken with respect to? If it is taken wrt $\\theta_n$, then the author clearly forgot to apply the chain rule to $\\theta_n / \\lVert {\\theta_n} \\rVert$. Also, the value of $i_n$ is in general not unique.\n\n2. In the second equation of the proof of Theorem 4.3, the gradient of $\\lVert \\theta \\rVert^\\alpha$ is computed incorrectly, again seemed to be an omission of chain rule. Also, the dimensions in the middle and right expressions do not match.\n\nNext, the formatting of the paper is wrong. It seems that the author put most of the paper into a enumerate block, thus affect the indentation throughout the paper. It is clear to me that no proof-reading was done.\n\nWith these observations in mind, I am convinced that this paper is deeply flawed and I cannot trust the author's claims.\n\nAdditionally, there are some minor mistakes that further hurt the quality of the paper.\n\n3. Many quantities were not adequately defined before they were being used. For instance, Lipschitzness of $\\nabla g$ was not mentioned until Section 4. In the same equation block I pointed to in my first comment, $k_n$ was not defined. In equation (3), $\\hat{c}$ was not defined.\n\n4.

Particularly, whether the intriguing phenomenon happens in Adagrad-Norm optimization on training deep learning model is unclear to me.\n\nAs claimed by the authors, for deterministic AdaGrad-Diagonal, (Soudry et al., 2018; Gunasekar et al., 2018; Qian & Qian, 2019) claim that it does not converge to the L2 max-margin solution as the non-adaptive methods do (e.g. SGD, GD).
