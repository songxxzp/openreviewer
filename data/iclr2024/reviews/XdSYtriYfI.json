                "value": "While the paper introduces a novel approach to an interesting problem, there are several areas that could benefit from further improvement:\n1. The assumption of identical MDPs and reward functions across all agents limits the generalizability and applicability of the proposed approach to real-world scenarios. Exploring techniques to handle heterogeneity among agents' environments could enhance the practicality of the framework.\n2. The requirement for the server to have access to the complete MDP raises concerns about privacy and may not be practical in many scenarios. Providing a practical example or discussing potential alternatives for this setup would strengthen the paper's applicability.\n3. The paper assumes **knowledge of dataset quality**, but it does not thoroughly address the issue of comparing and assessing the quality of different datasets. Specifically, in Sec. 4 , is the dataset generated by hopper-expert-v2 guaranteed to be better than that generated by hopper-medium-v2? Suppose that $D_m$ is generated by the medium policy which has converged while $D_e$ is generated by the expert policy during the initial random exploration stage. Is the quality of $D_e$ always better than $D_m$ ? It is important to explore methods to evaluate dataset quality more robustly and consider scenarios where the assumption of one dataset being consistently better than another may not hold.\n4. Experimental details for Figure 1 are missing, making it difficult to fully understand and interpret the results. Including the specific experimental setup, including hyperparameters, training procedures, and any other relevant details, would enhance the reproducibility and credibility of the findings.\n5. Eq. (7) implies that the server selects the action based on a weighted average of all agents' actions. Further clarification is needed to explain how the weights assigned to individual agents' actions influence the final decision. Does the weighting scheme prevent one agent from significantly overpowering the others? If not, what mechanisms or strategies are in place to address potential dominance issues and ensure a balanced contribution from all participating agents?\n6. The process of training the centralized policy to achieve the straight-line performance in Figure 2 requires further explanation.\n7. Can you compare the performance of FEDORA with just the expert policy running the offline RL algorithm in Fig. 2?\n8. Some important FedRL papers are missing from reference. Including them would strengthen the scholarly contribution of the paper."
