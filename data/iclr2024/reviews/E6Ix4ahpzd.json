                "value": "This paper addresses the question of whether is possible to manipulate open-sourced LLMs to achieve the generation of undesired content. The authors propose a method called Probability Manipulation (ProMan) that intervenes in the generation process of LLMs to guide them in generating harmful or sensitive content. The key idea behind ProMan is to directly manipulate the probability distribution of tokens in the generation process of the LMs to guide them in generating specific tokens, in order to create an affirmative prefix. Secondly, they alternate specific tokens during the generation with their predefined negative pairs (e.g. unethical \u2192 ethical). They conduct experiments on exposing harmful content and on private leakage with four open-sourced LLMs and demonstrate various case studies of undesired generations. The paper also discusses potential countermeasures to mitigate harmful generations. The contributions of this work include the introduction of ProMan, the empirical evaluation of its performance, and the exploration of potential defence strategies for open-sourced LLMs."

The experiments conducted on different LLMs and attack scenarios provide initial evidence for the effectiveness of ProMan in generating undesired content and privacy leakage.\n\n3) By demonstrating the ability to manipulate LLMs and generate harmful content, the paper raises important questions about the security and responsible use of these models. It contributes to the ongoing discussions on LLM safety and calls for more advanced mitigation strategies."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) The authors promise to misguide open LLMs \"without careful prompt designs\". They do exactly that, in a careful and complicated manner they design the prompt of the model and alternate specific tokens of the produced output (that is used as input to produce the following tokens...). \n\n2) The interesting probability manipulation idea, in practice consists of enforcing an affirmative prefix and negating six predefined tokens. \n\n3) The enforced production of the affirmative prefix,  is identical to appending a suffix to the prompt, making it unnecessarily complicated and less novel than what is presented. \n\n4) The negation reversing aspect, while the only novelty of the paper, is limited in scope as it only changes six tokens with their predefined negative pairs. \n\n5) The paper only compares ProMan with two baseline attacks, one heuristic and one optimization-based, but fails to provide a comprehensive evaluation against a wider range of existing attack methods. \n\n6) It would be beneficial to expand the evaluation to larger LLMs to provide more robust and reliable results on scale. \n\n7) For the privacy leakage experiment the evaluation is based on a relatively small evaluation set of 100 queries. \n\n8) In the Possible Countermeasures section the paper presents almost generic methods from the literature to address current issues with LLMs. It would be beneficial to discuss specific solutions for the specific proposed method or for \"prompt hacking\" in general. \n\n9) The paper lacks a thorough analysis and discussion of the potential ethical implications of the proposed method. Given that the goal of the work is to expose the limitations of alignment in preventing misuse of LLMs, it would be important to address the potential harm and ethical concerns associated with such misuse. Providing a more comprehensive analysis of the ethical considerations and discussing potential mitigation strategies would strengthen the paper's contribution to addressing the responsible development and usage of LLMs."

If you want to generate something harmful, what's the point of getting yourself into trouble by using an aligned version of LLM and trying hard to circumvent/de-align the alignment?\n- A more desirable setting will be attacking the aligned LLMs using only input prompts without the need to modify the output distributions.

Evaluation of affirmativeness and harmfulness is conducted automatically via word matching and an external LLM, respectively. While LLM-based evaluation can be accurate, still some human evaluation is critically needed for this work. For example, affirmativeness is judged based on the presence/absence of a fixed set of negative words. Is that set of words comprehensive enough? How about False positives? Similarly, the quality of the used LLM for judging harmfulness needs to be confirmed even with a small set of human verified examples.\n\t\n3. The paper lacks error analysis.
