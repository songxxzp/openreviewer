How would the performance change if we also include the feature dimension in the convolutional filter?\n\n3. Why just one layer of convolution? How does the performance change if multiple layers are applied? This may help to capture longer periodic patterns or even help with the multi-period issue.\n\n4. As also mentioned in the paper, the effectiveness of relatively simple models such as DLinear and the convolutional network may largely depend on the nature of the current tasks. For much more complex time series with more features and periodic complexities, such simpler methods may not be as good as the transformer-based models.\n\n5.

                "value": "Based on your understanding of the AI industry, you believe this paper has the following shortcomings:\n\n1. Lack of innovation:\n   - The model used in the paper consists of only two layers of convolutional networks, along with a decomposition of trend and periodic components. The loss function used is the classical MSE loss. There is a lack of innovation in the model design.\n   - The innovation mainly lies in explaining the good performance of the simple convolutional model. However, the paper only provides a simple \"proof\" that convolutional kernels larger than a certain duration can capture periodic information shorter than that duration. The subsequent heatmaps only qualitatively observe that the model captures some periodic information, without explaining why the simple convolutional model is competitive.\n   - Obvious conclusions, such as the smaller memory footprint, shorter training and inference time, and fewer parameters of the simple model, are extensively analyzed and explained in the paper.\n\n2. Experimental limitations:\n   - The paper lacks several important baseline models based on CNN architectures, such as SCINet and TimesNet, in the Conv-based model category (this is particularly severe, as all models in this category are proposed in this paper).\n   - MLP-based models lack models like N-Hits, and there is also a lack of references to the aforementioned models.\n   - The discussion of \"model performance with respect to lookback\" in Section C.1 lacks the inclusion of DConv. Considering Table 1 and Table 2, which compare the model results, the \"best\" model used in the tables is actually the model with a lookback of 1600, which naturally performs better than other baseline models with smaller lookback values that have not reached their optimal states. Moreover, even the \"best\" model is outperformed by PatchTST, which does not have data with lookback values of 720, 1000, and 1600.\n   - The performance of the proposed models in complex datasets like Traffic is poor.\n\n3. Presentation issues:\n   - The quality of the figures illustrating the model is low and overly simplified.\n   - There are formatting issues with the caption of Figure 6.\n\nIn summary, the identified shortcomings of the paper include a lack of innovation in the model design, experimental limitations in terms of missing baseline models and dataset performance, and presentation issues with figures and captions."

                "value": "**Summary:**\n\nThe paper aims to address the challenges faced by Transformer-based models in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks, mainly when dealing with long sequence lengths. The authors propose a new model, LTSF-Conv, which utilizes depthwise convolution models to enhance forecasting performance while significantly reducing computational costs. \n\n**Strengths:**\n\nFrom the computational efficiency (memory usage/flops) perspective, this paper reports very promising results on several datasets. \n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\nFrom the accuracy perspective, two recent CNN baseline models, TimesNet and MICN [1] are missing in Table 1 and Table 2. Moreover, the hyperparameter-searching is used, which makes the comparison a little bit unfair. For example, in TimesNet and MICN, the model configurations and lookback window remain the same for most of the experiments, and in PatchTST, only two configurations are considered. Based on the current results, it is hard for me to tell whether the performance gain is from the better model configuration or the proposed structure. \n\nMoreover, based on my understanding of Section 4.1, the main takeaway message would be there are two useful structures, depth-wise 1Dconv, and/or trend/seasonality decomposition. A similar idea (i.e., 1Dconv + decomposition) is also mentioned in MICN (e.g.,  Figure 1 in [1]). One more interesting thing here is the usage of depth-wise CNN instead. As shown in Table 4, deep-wise gives significant performance improvements. I would expect a more in-depth analysis of why it reaches better results than vanilla CNN. Based on the current presentation, it is a little bit difficult for me to understand what inductive bias can only be utilized by depth-wise CNN but not general CNN.\n\nThe theoretical analysis is also kind of weak. Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 consider simple autoregressive state-space structure and MLP/RNN models can also have the same prediction power. MLP can be viewed as a CNN with kernel size equal to the sequence length. RNN is commonly used to model state-space structures. Theorem 2 considers the sequence with both trend and seasonality. From my understanding, the MLP/RNN may also reach a similar performance guarantee.  \n\nAfter reviewing the sample codes in the supplementary material. I also have some concerns about the numerical results reported in the paper. When dealing with test samples, the data_provider function sets the drop_last = True and shuffle_flag = False. The consequence would result in the last several test samples being ignored. Those samples are usually the hardest to predict since they are far away from the training set. Moreover, it seems the main results in Table1 and Table2 are only run with one fixed random seed 1024. The random control experiment is only reported in Figure 5 in the Appendix.\n\n\n**Questions and Suggestions:**\n\n1. As the title used the word *minimalism*, I would conjecture the main advantage of using simple depth-wise CNN would be its robustness. The time series forecating usually contains a lot of time-varying noise especially when using longer inputs. The usage of a simpler model would have less risk of overfitting that noise but a potential drawback would be more modeling bias may be introduced due to limited representation power. Therefore, I would expect the analysis from the theoretical part to consider the high noise system, such as $x(t)  = x(t-p) + \\epsilon\\_t$ where $\\epsilon\\_t$  could be on the same order of $x(t)$, and analyze the generalization ability of depth-wise CNN to show it will have better variance bias trade-off.\n\n2. Please add TimesNet and MICN as benchmarks in Table 1 and Table 2. \n\n3. Please fix the dataloader issue in the test part and rerun the relevant experiments. It would be better to also report the random control results in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n4. Please provide the detailed experimental configurations for each setting in Table 1 and Table 2 to help the reviewer verify those results.\n\n5. Could the author elaborate more on the seq_last in ConvNet.py file? It seems not to be discussed in Section 4. Moreover, since Revnorm has been used, the sequence would already be centered, why do we still need to subtract the sequence mean?\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the paper explores an intriguing concept that simpler models might suffice for certain datasets, the current depth of analysis and the reliability of numerical results do not yet support a strong case for acceptance at a top-tier machine learning conference like ICLR. Despite this, the reviewer is willing to reconsider the decision after the authors' rebuttal.\n\n\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Wang, Huiqiang, Jian Peng, Feihu Huang, Jince Wang, Junhui Chen, and Yifei Xiao. \"Micn: Multi-scale local and global context modeling for long-term series forecasting.\" In The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations. 2022."
