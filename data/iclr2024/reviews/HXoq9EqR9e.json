Instead of using the original HSIC, this paper proposes to use a simplified version following Sadeghi et al. The proposed simplified HSIC provides a closed-form solution to the additional feature encoders when the features are fixed. To make the method efficient, this paper proposes to approximate Cholesky decomposition using random Fourier features (RFF), resulting in reducing the computational complexity from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2)$.

                "value": "### Scope of the paper\n\nThe terminology \"VLM\" is misused in this paper. VLM literally includes a vast area of models trained with vision and language. For example, visual-question answering (VQA) is a VLM model, vision-language pre-training (VLP) with cross-attention transformers (such as ViLBERT [R2], ViLT [R3], Align [R4], VinVL [R5], ALBEF [R6], BLIP [R7]) is VLM, multi-modal generation models, such as dall-e 1, 2 and 3, stable diffusion or dreambooth, are VLM, and recent language-model combined vision models, such as BLIP2 [R8], Fromage [R9], GPT-4, are VLM. (I omitted some famous works, such as dall-e, SD, GPT ...).\n\n- [R2] Lu, Jiasen, et al. \"Vilbert: Pretraining task-agnostic visiolinguistic representations for vision-and-language tasks.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 32 (2019).\n- [R3] Kim, Wonjae, Bokyung Son, and Ildoo Kim. \"Vilt: Vision-and-language transformer without convolution or region supervision.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

I feel that the title \"FairVLM\" and the terminology \"VLM\" are too much overclaimed, and a reader can misunderstand the focus of this paper. I think this paper should tone down its contribution and focus more specifically. This paper only targets a feature refinement method top on the frozen CLIP model, and the comparison methods are also methods using frozen CLIP encoders. Note that it is still a narrow topic in \"de-biasing CLIP zero-shot prediction\" because a number of works focus on the fine-tuning strategy [R10-12]. On the other hand, this paper relies on the pre-trained feature encoders that may weakens its contribution.\n\n- [R10] Wortsman, Mitchell, et al. \"Robust fine-tuning of zero-shot models.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022.\n- [R11] So, Junhyuk, et al. \"Geodesic multi-modal mixup for robust fine-tuning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.03897 (2022).\n- [R12] Vogt-Lowell, Kevin, et al. \"Robust Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models for Domain Generalization.\" IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC). 2023.\n\n### Missing related works\n\nIncluding [R1-12] in the first comment, there are a number of missing related works that should be discussed. For example, HSIC is a popular approach in de-biasing studies [R13, R14]. R13 directly optimizes the HSIC between features and sensitive attribute labels, similar to Dep(Z, Y) in the paper; R14 optimizes the HSIC between biased features and target features to avoid using sensitive attribute labels Y. If we extend our viewpoint to RHKS, there is work using MMD to achieve fairness [R15]. I omitted many HSIC-based regularization methods that could be related to this work, but if possible, it would be great to add more citations for methods using HSIC.\n\n- [R13] Quadrianto, Novi, Viktoriia Sharmanska, and Oliver Thomas. \"Discovering fair representations in the data domain.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2019.\n- [R14] Bahng, Hyojin, et al. \"Learning de-biased representations with biased representations.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2020.\n- [R15] Jung, Sangwon, et al. \"Fair feature distillation for visual recognition.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2021.\n\nAlso, in terms of employing pseudo-labels for the de-biasing optimization, I think this paper is also related to [R16]; where R16 is based on semi-supervised learning without the pseudo-label refinement process.\n\n- [R16] Jung, Sangwon, Sanghyuk Chun, and Taesup Moon. \"Learning fair classifiers with partially annotated group labels.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022.\n\n### Unclear or missing details\n\nWhile reading the paper, I had trouble understanding the details of the paper. For example, it is still unclear to me how the \"encoder\" works. I presume that the encoder parameter $\\Theta$ is a linear projection and an RBF kernel is used for computing HSIC, but it is unclear. Also, there is no description of $r$ (r becomes the dimensionality of the generated representation) and the value of $r$ as well. It means that this paper does not provide any detail of RKHS hyperparameters, such as the dimensionality of the projection layer and the hyperparameter of the kernel method. Similarly, I cannot find any detail of the choice of the learning hyperparameters, such as the number of iterations, and batch size. It means that it is impossible or extremely difficult to reproduce the results in this paper. Overall, this paper is very hard to understand the method details and implementation details, although I think this paper has certain contributions in terms of the methodology development."

                "value": "I think the technical contribution of this paper is sound and empirical evaluation results look reasonable. However, this paper has a critical problem in its writing and presentation, including many missing related works and details. Please check my initial review and respond to my concerns. Specifically, I would like to clarify all the details of how the method is implemented and trained in the revised version, which is not presented in the initial version. I think the initial version is improper to be published as an ICLR paper, but my concern is mostly around the writing, that could be improved during the revision period. I presume that the revised manuscript will need significant efforts, but mainly in the presentation, rather than technical enhancement. Hence, if the revised manuscript is sound and can resolve my initial concerns, I am willing to update my score."
