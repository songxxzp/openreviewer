                "value": "Unfortunately, in the current state this submission does not meet the bar for acceptance at ICLR. Some of the biggest concerns are the following:\n\n**W1 (presentation unclear)**: First and foremost, the presentation and organisation of the manuscript are severely lacking. Even after reading the manuscript several times, the exact setup studied remains unclear to me. Given that the authors aim to introduce a 'benchmark for KD under distribution shift', this is a major concern. To name a few open questions: what data are the students trained on for any given dataset? What data are the teachers trained on? Why should one hope to obtain students that are robust to the colour shift in CMNIST if the teachers are not robust either (see table 1)? \n\n**W2 (insufficient contribution)**: As far as I can follow, the authors seem to evaluate 12 existing KD approaches on 5 different datasets (as discussed in W1, the exact setting remains unclear), apply various augmentation techniques during training, and optimise the hyperparameters for the different approaches. While the breadth of KD approaches and a grid search over the hyperparameters are laudable, this seems to be a minimal requirement for an experimental comparison rather than a sufficient contribution. Of course, a thorough experimental evaluation can be highly valuable if it allows for obtaining new insights or develop novel hypotheses that can be further explored in future work. However, in this submission, the lack of clarity w.r.t. the setting (see W1) make this difficult and the findings discussed by the authors (e.g. data augmentation helps performance) are not sufficiently novel. \n\n**W3 (technical soundness)**: The authors make several statements that are unclear or that lack a thorough experimental validation. Some examples:\n   - \"[Our benchmark] can provide insight into different ways and enhance KD interpretability and stability by regulating negativity.\" In which way does the benchmark increase KD interpretability or stability? What do these terms mean in this context? What does \"regulating negativity\" mean? \n   - \"In theory, we expect the student model can generalize to different distributions that are invisible shifts.\" Again, it is unclear to me what this means. \n   - \"These findings inspired us to further understand the role of knowledge source in KD against distribution shift, and guides us to design new algorithms.\" It is unclear to me which 'new algorithms' the authors refer to here.\n   - \"Different students fall into diverse activation maps.\" + Figure 4: the CAM visualisations of a single image are not sufficient to support the conclusions drawn by the authors.\n   - More generally, the lack of clarity with respect to the experimental setup (see W1) makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions from the presented results"

Regarding the type of distribution shfit, the authors study the diversity and correlation shift. I think the author can consider another type. [2] proposed the nasty teacher, where the dark knowledge (representation distribution) of teacher network is *corrupted* and thus is undistillable. [3] lately study how to distill the corrupted teacher knowledge, where the representation distribution of student is normal.\n3.

The choice of models, like ResNet50 compared to the CLIP model, can yield drastically different results and insights.\n\nFrom my own research and experimentation, I've observed that the network architecture has a significant influence on both KD and Domain Generalization (DG). More recent architectures, such as ConNext or VIT variants, might interact differently with KD compared to traditional CNNs.\n\nIt wasn't surprising to find that most KD methods falter under distribution shifts. Past research on KD has shown that many methods don't even perform optimally on In-Distribution (I.ID), making it less likely they'd excel in Out-of-Distribution (OoD) scenarios. Additionally, the paper's finding that data augmentation methods are effective for DG was somewhat expected. Given that many DG benchmarks aren't large-scale, it stands to reason that random data augmentations would be beneficial.\n\nLastly, while the paper offers insights into the performance of Pretraining and Optimizer Selection, the scope seems limited. Drawing conclusions solely from the PACS dataset may be premature. It's a stretch to claim that SGD outperforms Adam based on this limited data. Furthermore, the advantage of using pre-trained weights over non-pretrained ones is a well-established fact in the literature, so it doesn't present a novel revelation in this context."

However, all the compared KD algorithms in this paper are before 2020, which is too old for a 2023 manuscript. There are several recent works that the authors may consider including:\nThe primary concern highlighted is the omission of recent advancements in Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods in the paper. While it is reasonable for a benchmark study to focus on representative techniques, the absence of any KD algorithms post-2019 in a manuscript for 2023 is conspicuous. To maintain relevance and scholarly rigor, the inclusion of several works from the past few years should be considered. This will not only enhance the comprehensiveness of the paper but also ensure that the evaluation reflects the current state of the art in KD methods. There are several recent works that the authors may consider:\n - Annealing KD (Jafari et al., 2021); \n - DKD (Zhao et al., 2022); \n - FilterKD (Ren et al., 2022); \n - MetaDistill (Zhou et al., 2022); \n - PTLoss (Zhang et al., 2023). \n\n2. The analysis part just provides limited insights. I personally expect a bit more reasons / explanations about why a group of algorithms fails in the studied setting. For example, in the second paragraph of Sec 4.1, we only get vanilla KD is better, but still do not understand why those complex methods just offer limited improvement. \n\n3.
