Similar attacks have been proposed in one of the seminal works of backdoor [1]. It is a well-known fact that poisoning the training data with only tens of images of a face wearing a pair of sunglasses can lead to a high attack success rate. Note that the poisoning in [1] uses a weak blended trigger -- directly using real photos for poisoning should require an even lower poisoning ratio.\n\nBesides, the proposed method for the generation of the trigger seems unnecessary in practice (with other concerns in the sequel). Training a generative model is costly while using open-sourced models will limit the application domain (based on the ASR vs PR curves in Figure 6).\n\nUnfortunately, this work has limited contribution due to a lack of additional intellectual merit.\n\n[1] Chen et al, Targeted backdoor attacks on deep learning systems using data poisoning, 2017.\n\n* The methodology needs more consideration.\n\nThe reasoning behind the trigger assessment method lacks clarity. There is no evidence showing that models will outperform humans in recognizing the injected trigger objects. It is also unclear why the trigger will be learned if it is recognizable by an object detector. The entire pipeline appears to be heuristic.\n\n* The performance gain of the proposed method over existing ones is marginal.\n\nAlso, the poisoning ratio of the proposed trigger is very large.\n\n* Omission of existing works.\n\nThe generative model in the proposed work is not state-of-the-art (see [2]). Visible sample-specific triggers have been studied by an early defense in [3].\n\n[2] Liu et al, Cones: Concept Neurons in Diffusion Models for Customized Generation, 2023.\n[3] Xiang et al, Revealing perceptible backdoors in DNNs, without the training set, via the maximum achievable misclassification fraction statistic, 2020."

To address this issue, they propose the use of VSSC triggers that are both effective and resilient to visual distortions. These triggers are designed to have a significant magnitude, increase detection complexity, have semantic meaning, and blend seamlessly with the image content. The authors propose a novel approach to implement VSSC triggers using large language models and text-guided image editing techniques. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness of the VSSC triggers, showcasing their superiority compared to state-of-the-art backdoor attacks. The paper also highlights the advantages of the proposed method in both digital and physical spaces."

Also, from Table 3 and Table 4, I am not convinced that the proposed method is better than baselines. Many bold values are from baselines. This does not align with corresponding text explanation in the paper. Could the author explain it in detail?\n\n4. Minor. In Section 4.2, the algorithm will be more clear and precise if the author can use a pseudo-code, rather than natural language. Also, some adopted techniques are just a reference (like image editing and dense caption). It would be better to provide brief description for better reading experience."
