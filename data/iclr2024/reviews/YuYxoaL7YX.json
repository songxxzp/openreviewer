Since the main contribution of the paper is about the QOT arrivals model, I believe that the RL part should not be  heavily described in the paper.\n- The design of GenQOT model and the experiments should be explained in separate sections. Furthermore, I believe that the model design and learning methods should be detailed in the main text, not deferring it to appendix, since those are what first proposed in this paper.\n- As GenQOT arrivals model is first proposed, I would expect other models, e.g. lead time model, to be compared with GenQOT in terms of their predictive performance. However, as far as I understood, the absolute errors of the proposed model is shown, and it is hard to judge whether the proposed model is useful or not.\n- While the discounted reward is shown in table 2, I would expect GenQOT based agent to obviously outperform other agents when evaluated under Gen-QOT dynamics, as other agents are needed to adapt. Combined with the issue above, I believe that the performance of proposed model is not well proven overall."
