They also illustrate that the negative value in Tanh will result in suboptimal expressive power.\nThe authors verify their findings empirically on several graph and node-level benchmarks, in comparison with several MPNNs and graph transformers.\nOn graph-level tasks, the variant with the sigmoid function reaches the best performance in general.\nOn node-level tasks, the outperformance is less remarkable."

                "value": "1. This work focuses on 'MPNN-based Graph Transformers' which is a controversial concept. Even though previous works in graph transformers acknowledge the contribution of the pioneer works with sparse attention, such as Dwivedi & Bresson (2021), \nmost researchers concede that the key difference between Graph Transformers and attention-based MPNNs is the ability to aggregate beyond first-hop neighborhoods, in order to address over-squashing issues and expressive-limitation (bounded by 1-WL algorithms). \n(Ying et al., 2021; Kreuzer et al., 2021; Rampasek et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023)\n2. Even though many recent works on graph transformers focus on computational efficiency (mainly for node-level tasks), there are also many recent graph transformers emphasizing expressive power, neglected by the authors (Kreuzer et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Rampasek et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023).\n3. Previous works have introduced degree-scalers to mitigate the information loss of degrees in mean-aggregation (including softmax-based attention), i.e., PNA (Corso et al., 2020) for MPNNs, GRIT (Ma et al., 2023) for graph transformers. These techniques are not mentioned or compared in this work.\n4. The work does not conduct experiments on several more widely used graph-level benchmarks in graph transformer literature, e.g., BenchmarkingGNNs (Dwivedi et al., 2020) and Long-Range Graph Benchmarks (Dwivedi et al., 2022). Datasets, like MUTAG, PTC, etc, are rarely used for evaluating graph transformers in recent works. \n5. The authors do not include any latest graph transformers after 2021 in the experiments of graph-level tasks, including but not limited to Rampasek et al., (2022), Zhang et al., (2023), and Ma et al., (2023), which have renewed SOTA performances on several graph-level tasks.

GTs are fundamentally different from GNNs where the core assumption is that all nodes are aggregated, i.e. $v \\in \\mathbb{V}$ instead of $v \\in \\mathcal{N}(u)$ in Eq.3. With that in mind, the claim that softmax cannot effectively discern the number of neighbors is questionable (because the target node is also considered). The example in Figure 1 (a) is also incorrect, considering a node u, with identical neighbours, say $x_u=2, x_v=1, \\forall v\\in \\mathcal{N}_1(u)$. For different neighborhood set  $\\mathcal{N}_2(u)=(v_1, v_2)$  (Figure 1 (a) left) $\\mathcal{N}'(u)=(v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4)$  (right), $softmax(x_u \\cup \\mathcal{N}(u) )$ leads to $(0.58, 0.21, 0.21)$, and $(0.4, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15)$. Note the distributions are different: the target node u (the first one) gets less attention when the number of neighbors increases.\n\nW2. The authors claim that: \"softmax retains its effectiveness when the number of computed components remains constant, as seen in applications like image or natural language processing\" This is not true according to my understanding, for NLP, repeating words (tokens) shifts the attention distribution and the overall distribution. Empirically, for a trained LM,  repeating words largely shifts the distribution, leading to out-of-distribution problems for LMs, which also demonstrates the effectiveness of softmax in discerning the number of neighbors. \n\nW3. The notations confusing: (1) $\\boldsymbol{v}_v^t(u)$ $\\boldsymbol{k}_v^t(u)$ are functions of u, yet has nothing to do with node u; (2) typo of $\\boldsymbol{W}_V^t$ v.s $W_v^t$ behind Eq. 3.\n\nW4.

The main consideration of using Softmax function is close to its normalization over the involved nodes. Actually there are many types of activation functions that can be applied. Then why should we only discuss the three exponential functions? As we know that, graph isomorphic network (GIN) derives that just addition operator over the neighbors can be a strong method to improve the expressivity. The properties of linear rectifiers partially keeps the original values. What kind of things can happen if we select them as the activation functions?\n\n2. There is still concern on the capability of using sigmoid as the activation function. We can see that applying sigmoid function to the attention weight equals to approximately creating a binary mask where negative similarity between a pair of nodes will be masked out. In this case, it only focus on node pairs with positive similarity, but ignore the rest of dissimilar neighbors. Let's take a pair of nodes as example. The first node includes 2 positive and 4 negative neighbors, while the second node includes 2 positive and 2 negative neighbors. In such situation, we will get the same value for these two nodes, even they have totally different graph structure. \n\n3. The contributions of each component is not clear enough to demonstrate superiority of modification on the activation function. (i) The transformer layer contains layer normalization, while only applying sigmoid function to attention layer might have gradient exploration issue if the number of neighbors are over a certain number. (2) In this work, it should apply the modification to different base models, but not only to the designed transformer layer in Equation (5) and (6). As we can see that, only changing the activation function is a very general technology. If someone plans to demonstrate its effectiveness, it should keep the rest of part the as the baseline, but only changing the activation function of each layer. Please conduct experiments to make the modification more convincing."
