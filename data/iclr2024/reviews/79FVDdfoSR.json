Theorem 1 seems to be a relatively simple consequence of these results.    \n\n2. Though the paper includes a discussion of applications of Theorem 1 in Sections 5 and 6, I found these sections not easy to follow.

The context of these comments is explained relatively vaguely, partly through references to other papers. It is not really clear to me why any of these corollaries and comments is actually important. The paper does not include specific examples, illustrations or experiments showing how Theorem 1 can, say, help improve designs of equivariant models. \n\n**Writing.** The writing is sloppy in several places, with typos and unclear grammar. For example, only in Lemma 5:\n- the index $i$ seems to be missing in the definition of $\\mathcal{T}(\\mathcal M)$; \n- the indices and coefficients are wrong in the formula for $f(\\sum_{j\\in S}M_{rj}x)$; \n- a word seems to be missing in \"It is a simple to check\".\n\nI could understand the proof of Lemma 5 only with some effort (especially the sentence \" And obviously each..\").

However, I believe that in order for it to be of practical value the paper should be more accessible to a broader audience. Although formal and precise, there is little effort put in describing the main results in plain English.\n2. Although partially covered by clarifying the scope of the paper, I do think the notion of regular representations is insufficiently covered. By sticking to irreducible representations one naturally comes to the conclusion that if one wants to apply point-wise activations one has to use trivial (invariant) irreps. However, if one admits regular representations (either approximations in the full SO(n) case, or exact as in the discrete sub-group cases of SO(n)) then one is not limited to invariants as the regular representations are effectively permutation representations. The regular representations can also be defined in the continuous setting, though the discretization may introduce some equivariance error, however, this need not be a problem as one could use random grids to avoid such biases. See e.g. Kuipers-Bekkers-2023:\n\nKuipers, T.P., Bekkers, E.J. (2023). Regular SE(3) Group Convolutions for Volumetric Medical Image Analysis. In: Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention \u2013 MICCAI 2023. LNCS, vol 14222. Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-43898-1_25\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13960\n\nAs for equivariant models with point-wise activation functions, it is often the case that internally the models use (non-trivial) irreps to parametrize the layers, and use an inverse Fourier transform to transform back to the regular representation basis, apply point-wise activation, then project back to irrep basis. I think including such approach in the discussions enable more people to relate to the result of the paper. Although commonly used in practice, I did find it hard to find references to such approaches. See e.g. the library e3nn ( https://docs.e3nn.org/en/latest/api/nn/nn_s2act.html ) and escnn (https://quva-lab.github.io/escnn/api/escnn.nn.html?highlight=fourier#escnn.nn.FourierPointwise). As for papers I could find [Cesa et al. 2021] Appendix H.2:\n\nCesa, G., Lang, L., & Weiler, M. (2021, October). A program to build E (N)-equivariant steerable CNNs. In International Conference on Learning Representations.\n\nand perhaps the following as it represents signals on a grid but performs convs in the Fourier domain\n\nCohen, T. S., Geiger, M., K\u00f6hler, J., & Welling, M. (2018, February). Spherical CNNs. In International Conference on Learning Representations.\n\n3. By the previous item, remarks such as (see abstract) \"we prove that rotation-equivariant networks can only be invariant\" is in practice more nuanced, and I consider the statement actually incorrect. Another example of a rotation equivariant method based on equivariantly obtained spherical grids (they call it equivariant mesh) is GemNet:\n\nGasteiger, J., Becker, F., & G\u00fcnnemann, S. (2021). Gemnet: Universal directional graph neural networks for molecules. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34, 6790-6802.\n\nEffectively, the paper works with scalar fields over the homogeneous space $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times S^2$, as also discussed in recent work https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02970 , which also fully operates in the domain of regular representations. I remark that this reference seem to have appeared only after the ICLR deadline so of course I do not expect this to have been included.\n\n4. In conclusion, I think the paper could improve on impact if the relation to regular group convolution methods is further clarified and if the main results are introduced in simpler terms. The claim that equivariant networks can only be invariant is I think an artifact of the choice of sticking to irreducible representations.\n\nThank you for the great work and for considering my comments. I'm open to discussing my comments as I could have surely misinterpreted some parts of the paper."

I did not understand the introduction of the main result \"Although employing techniques analogue to already known ones, we highlight how hypothesis can generalize ... of the basis\" Apart from this sentence being too long, I really do not understand what is being said here, please rewrite.\n3. Theorem 1 could benefit from some subsequent, explicit examples. Take ReLU and e.g. a cyclic permutation group. Or any example you see fit. I think the paper remains abstract throughout and I think it could be helpful to see some common examples.\n4. Section 5.1 is also a bit abstract still, dispite being in the section for practical scenarios. Some laymans explainations of the quotient structure could be helpful. In particular I struggled with \"...an equivariant isomorphism between ... which is the standard representation space for permutations equivariant networks on sets\".\n5. Section 5.2 makes sense, but as discussed it is limited in scope regarding the use of irreducible representations exclusively. \n6. Could you clarify Corrolary 3. It is hard to understand what is about. In particular what is the significance of the connected component (are we talking about subgroups here?)\n7. \"... but not more general equivariant tasks such as segmentation or detection\" again this is an artifact of sticking to irreps."
