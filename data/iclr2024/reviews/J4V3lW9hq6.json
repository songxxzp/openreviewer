                "value": "This paper aims to learn a 2nd order neural ODE which emulates molecular dynamics trajectories of ligand-protein interactions from the Misato dataset. The force prediction is done via a new architecture called BindingNet, which is based on 3 levels of frames (ligand, protein atom, protein residue) and which is claimed to be SE(3)-equivariant. The method is shown to be more accurate than diffusion-based next-step predictors and more stable than simulating the dynamics with a learned force field."

                "value": "* It is encouraging to see the first works make use of the MISATO dataset, which contains a wealth of information about the very difficult problem of protein-ligand binding.\n* Directly learning the long-timescale dynamics with a neural ODE rather than a fixed-timestep next-step predictor is an interesting idea which merits broader exploration."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* Problem formulation. Although learning a neural ODE for long-timescale dynamics is an interesting idea, the deterministic problem formulation seems inappropriate as MD simulation itself is not necessarily deterministic. Thermostats and barostats typically introduce stochasticity, and even in their absence the removal of water molecules (which are explicit in the MISATO simulations) injects intrinsic uncertainty into the modeling problem. Hence, the dynamics are fundamentally stochastic and I am skeptical that any neural ODE can faithfully capture the long-timescale dynamics of these protein-ligand systems.\n\n* Performance and baselines. Even in the single-trajectory setting, the MAE for the ligand coordinates seems rather large, in the range of 2-6 angstroms. This is perhaps due to the suboptimal problem formulation already discussed. However, the numbers provided are not meaningful because we do not know what the RMSF is in these simulations. The RMSF is the best result that can be achieved by a single static structure and is an essential missing baseline. The MAE in the multi-trajectory setting is even larger (7 anstroms) and suggests a complete dissociation of the ligand from the binding pocket. Finally, the stability metrics are only marginally better than DenoisingMD and do not represent a qualitative resolution of the problem.\n\n* Misleading title. \u201cGroup symmetric\u201d suggests a much more general framework than SE(3)-equivariance, and the key contribution of the paper is not the equivariant architecture in my opinion.\n\n* Mathematical errors. Although the paper places much emphasis on SE(3)-equivariance, the construction of the atom-level and residue-level frames appears to be non-equivariant. Specifically, the cross product is not translation equivariant since\n$$(x_i + t) \\times (x_j + t) = (x_i \\times x_j) +  (x_i - x_j) \\times t$$\nis not a function of $(x_t\\times x_j)$ and $t$. Noticeably, the appendix claims the cross-product to be SE(3)-equivariant but only establishes rotation equivariance. Further, while I agree that the local frame construction described in the appendix is equivariant, this is different from what is done in the main text, since there is no nearest-neighbor atom $x_k$ and absolute positions $x_i, x_j$ are used.\n\nJustification for score. Although the paper is a commendable attempt to learn from MD data, I am not convinced that the problem formulation makes sense, and the experimental results are rather weak. The frame based architecture is not a significant technical advancement over existing frame architectures and appears to have flaws."
