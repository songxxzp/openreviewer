                "value": "- One of my concerns is the motivation of the paper given in the introduction. Why is it important to have end-to-end training and why are we not happy with the two-stage Meta-Baseline training? I think 2-stage training makes a lot of sense as one can simply take any pre-trained model. It is known that just throwing a backbone pre-trained on more data benefits few-shot learning. Having to re-train this backbone for few-shot learning specifically would be unnecessary use of time and resources.\n- The authors comment on figure 1 \u201cas shown in Figure 1, we observe that in the second stage of Meta-Baseline, the perfor- mance on the validation set first increases, then decreases, and finally, is even lower than that of the Prototypical Networks, indicating that the training of the first and second stages have some negative impact on each other\u201d. Is in it just called overfitting? The network has already been trained on the same dataset with a slightly different objective. It is no surprise that fine-tuning further will lead to overfitting faster.\n- The central result of the paper -  Equation 6 - is given without explanations and it is hard to understand why it is valid.\nWhile the authors suggest that their method is more efficient in terms of wall-clock time, there is no justification. To support this claim, it would be nice to see how much time it takes to train the Meta-Baseline, i.e., the classification pre-training + several epochs of meta-finetuning, vs full training of the proposed method.\n- It is nice to see encouraging results on the mini-ImageNet and tired-ImageNet dataserts, however these are old and non-informative datasets at this point. It would be nice to see some results on meta-dataset [A].\n- Last but not least, the authors suggest that one-stage training would be conceptually simpler, however after reading this paper I have the opposite feeling. Training Meta-Baseline, even though in two-stages, is a streamlined process with simple classification pre-training and simple meta-learning fine-tuning. On the other hand, in the proposed paper, it seems quite cumbersome to desing the inner and outer loop updates, and tune their hyperparameters, such as the number of iterations in each loop.\n\n\n[A] Triantafillou at al, Meta-dataset: A dataset of datasets for learning to learn from few examples, 2019"

Then, for T times, the inner loop is completed where the model is trained episodically but the propagated loss is a convex combination of the inner and outer losses.

Although the two-phase training is widely used as a routine process, not much is known about the reason why the process shows performance gains beyond the single-phase episodic training. Also, we do not know much about the optimality of the two-phase process in training deep models with strong generalization. This work has found that the two-phase training shows somewhat conflicting behaviors between phases (as shown in Fig. 1), which makes re-design the learning procedure of few-shot learners. That is the most interesting and valuable contribution of this paper.\n\n**Strength 2:** The proposed single-phase training process is fully model-agnostic, and we can even say that it is algorithm-agnostic. Therefore, I expect the proposed method can be widely applied to the prior meta-learners and other possible future learners."

In my opinion, the most important and fundamental question is the synergetic effect between conventional training and episodic training. Some authors have tried to focus on the differences between conventionally-trained and meta-trained feature extractors (Goldblum et al., 2020), but not many facts are unexplored yet. Therefore, I expect this work to unveil the role of the inner and outer optimization of the proposed method to fully understand the effects of the full-class classification objective and the few-shot training objective, respectively.\n\n**Weakness 2:** More experiments for validating the applicability of the proposed method would be required. I believe that one of the biggest advantages of this method is its wide applicability. Because this work touches on the training procedure, which is algorithm-agnostic, potential gains from applying the training procedure to a wide range of meta-learners would clearly elucidate the novelty of this method. However, only a naive version of 'Boost MT', which applies the training procedure to a simple ProtoNet style model, is experimented with. Will the method yield consistent gains when applied to other early meta-learners, including TPN (Liu et al., 2019) and TADAM (Oreshkin et al., 2018), or relatively recent approaches, including CAN (Hou et al., 2019) and STANet (Lai et al., 2023)? The first group of prior works is advanced metric-based meta-learners, and the second group is based on attention or transformer to boost the few-shot learning performance, which is now positioned as the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Weakness 3:** Further ablation studies that verify the algorithmic procedure in the proposed training should be provided. To the best of my understanding, I cannot find any ablation studies that answer the question of why we have to devise training procedures with the inner and outer structures. Also, what is the reason behind the losses for the inner and outer optimizations? What happens when we drop one of the inner and outer optimizations? In fact, these questions are closely related to 'Weakness 1' for verifying the synergetic advantages of the proposed training procedures.\n\nThere are some minor errors:\n- In Abstract, it would be better to say \"Also,\" rather than \"And\" at the beginning of a sentence.\n- In Introduction, please add a citation of 'Meta-Baseline', which is directly analyzed in the motivating experiment shown in Fig. 1.\n\nM.
