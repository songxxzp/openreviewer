Analytic experiments show that early exiting may, to some extent, mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem. Furthermore, the authors observed that the traditional early-exiting strategy is not suitable for continual learning, since a multi-exit model tends to have higher confidence for new tasks. Based on this, a threshold calibration trick is proposed, which improves the performance of early-exiting models in continual learning."

                "value": "This paper studies applying early exit image classifiers (ResNets) in a continual learning (CL) setup. The paper analyzes the accuracy and softmax-based confidence measures across different exit gates. The findings (e.g. figure 3) indicate that while for more recently observed tasks the accuracy increases throughout the layers of the model (as expected), for older tasks the performance stays roughly stationary. The authors conclude that older tasks can benefit more from early exiting, and that different tasks can use different confidence thresholds for exiting.\n\nThe authors propose to adjust the exiting confidence threshold according per task (called TDI). Experiments are performed on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets in a continual learning setup with multiple different CL methods. TDI provide better accuracy for matching speedup, though as expected all methods are far behind the non-CL setting that trains on all tasks jointly (JT)."

                "value": "1. The proposed TDI method requires knowing the total number of tasks $T$ which is not realistic for continual learning setup, and the specific task index $t$ which doesn't aligned with the experimented task-agnostic learning (TAG).\n2. Parts of the analysis are not convincing enough and the presented results don't always align with the claims in the text. For example, figure 5 only examines the confidence of the final layer, so it doesn't prove the claim in the text that \" it is significantly more likely to exit for later task data\". The confidence of earlier layers (and taking into account the exit policy) should be known for examining this. Also, the experiment in Figure 3 (b) should be repeated with different shuffling of the tasks to allow disentangling ordering of the tasks vs. task-specific features. \n3. The main repeated claim that the observed pattern \"can be leveraged to reduce catastrophic forgetting in the continual learning scenario\" also doesn't sound accurate. On the best performing CL method (BiC), early exits reduce the accuracy (Tables 1,2). Perhaps claiming that early exit models are less affected by catastrophic forgetting would be more aligned with the findings?\n4. Some details in the writing could be improved to flow better and help clarify the experiments. For example, sec 2.3 presents many CL methodologies but doesn't position them with the rest of the paper. sec 3.1 presents some settings (TIL, CIL, TAG, TAW), but the rest of the paper doesn't stick to them. The compute of FLOPs for speedup should be clarified, and what does it mean ~0% speedup in the tables? It's not entirely clear if comparing methods within the same column is fair or could there be differences in the actual speedup."

Additionally, the proposed TDI, is only applicable on a small subset of the examined cases, where the task-id at each CL-stage is available, and task classes are disjoint. Overall, although the paper offers several of useful insights from the preceding analysis, it lack a novel technical contribution that takes sufficient advantage of these findings. \n\n-The breadth of the evaluation (as well as analysis in Sec.4) in terms of the EE-models adopted is severely limited to help guide conclusive results. In reference a single CNN-based EE model is used and evaluated on Cifar-100 (and in some cases on TinyImagenet). More robust experimental evaluation and analysis of key finding is required to validate their robustness, considering more complex EE architectures (e.g. MSDNet) as well as validate that the results hold for EE-based vision transformers. \n\nGiven the above, I believe this work takes a very promising approach, but is not yet ready for publication at ICLR; but strongly encourage the authors to continue their investigation in this field extending the current progress."
