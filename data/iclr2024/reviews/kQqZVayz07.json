Compared to typical LLMs with at least 2k steps, isn\u2019t it too small to memorize useful information in the context?\n4. During alignment, try PPO algorithm, which is verified as effective by many papers. Furthermore, why this paper utilizes an **undiscounted** version of REINFORCE? How about direct policy optimization (DPO) that utilizes supervised learning style alignment? As this paper only finetunes the last layer, how about full-parameter finetuning? How about LoRA?\n5.

Some substantial augmentation on the experiment part should be done before it can be accepted by a major conference. Here are some suggestions:\n\n-Width: the authors have claimed they \"investigate how the procedure for aligning LLMs can be applied to aligning agents from pixels in a complex 3D environment\". Although I do agree that the environment can be visually perplexed, the task, however, might not be challenging enough. Is the goal hard to be recognized/identified due to the complextity of the 3D environment? Are there many distractions or interferences? Is the goal semantically rich therefore understanding it could become a challenge? Does the human preference over such goal go beyond simple multi-choice selection? Unfortunately, I find many of these aspects of interest when exploring pretraining - instruction-tuning - RLHF in game AI unchecked in this paper. Point is, this scheme has been verified in the language domain teaming with many of these aforementioned challenges and it actually work pretty well. Therefore, investigating this on a different domain (game AI), but without on par challenges, could be less illuminating to the community.\n\n-Depth: although the paper offers rich variants of reward models in the RLHF experiments section, some aspects can still be missing. To name a few: the scale of the model(both the base model and the reward model), error range, etc. These will help with a better understanding on applying RLHF in a new domain."

This is a meaningful contribution even if the overall process itself is not novel, however, I believe that the current set of behaviors studied in this work (navigating to 3 different locations) is too limited. The paper would be greatly strengthened if the sets of behaviors or tasks demonstrated by the base and fine-tuned agents were more complex. While I understand the merit of first studying the approach in a simpler setting to disentangle what the agent is learning at each stage, the paper would be more complete with additional experiments showing the methodology also works on learning more complex behaviors, as this is the underlying motivation of the work. \n- Rather than just having the bar plots in the first two stages and then reward curves for the final stage, the paper presentation would be strengthened with an overarching connecting figure showing a heat-map of how the agent behaviours across the map evolve at each stage (first showing diverse locations visited, then focusing on the jumppads evenly, then focusing on just the left/right one)."
