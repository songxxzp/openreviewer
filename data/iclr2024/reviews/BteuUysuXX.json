                "value": "The paper investigates the attack of VLMs, which will induce high energy-latency cost during inference via maximizing the length of the sequence. To achieve this aim, the paper proposes three losses, which first decrease the probability of the end-of-sequence token, and then increase the uncertainty of output tokens and diversity of token embeddings. Experiments are done on popular VLMs models including BLIP, BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4, and on common datasets including MS-COCO and ImageNet datasets."

I think the second loss, which increases the uncertainty of tokens is more like destroying the accurate outputs. While the paper claims that the second loss can help with longer sequences, I do not see a strong correlation. Can the authors give some description to build the relationship between sequence length and token uncertainty, which usually indicates less favorable accuracy performance? \n\n* In the third loss part, the paper claims that \u201cfor a matrix, the calculation of the matrix rank is an NP-hard non-convex problem\u201d, and thus proposes the third loss. Unfortunately, this is not true. For the 2-way matrix that corresponds to [token, hidden_states] in this example, the rank calculation is available by Gaussian elimination and is not NP-hard. Therefore, I keep doubting the motivation and design of the third loss, which also shows the least performance improvement in the ablation study.\n\n* The paper seems to target the problem in VLMs and claims that VLMs have special things like vulnerabilities from the manipulation of visual inputs. While it says that other methods for LLMs, can not be directly applied to VLMs, I do not see the special design or consideration in this method for challenges in VLMs."

I am not sure is this a real problem or not, as pointed by 1, a simple approach can resolve it (but with some tradeoff); on the other hand, as the attacked results do not make sense anymore (e.g. Fig.8), it seems the attacks can be easy identified.

To maximize the generated sequence length, this paper seeks to craft an imperceptible perturbation during the inference stage and proposes three losses to guide the derivation of the verbose image, including a delayed EOS loss, an uncertainty loss and a token diversity loss. In addition, a temporal weight adjustment algorithm is proposed for better optimization. Experiments on MSCOCO and ImageNet show the effectiveness of the proposed verbose images. Beyond inducing longer generated sequences, the verbose images can introduce more dispersed attention and enhance the object hallucination."
