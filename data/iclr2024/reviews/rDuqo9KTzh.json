The main idea is to leverage prompt to fast adapt input to the fixed meta-leaner (feature extractor), instead of computing nested gradients on the whole model, in order to improve learning/inference efficiency. Experiments on four benchmark datasets were provided under two simple backbone models (4-conv layer network and ResNet12) compared with a series of strong baselines."

While lacking strong empirical evidence (see weaknesses), the Bayesian treatment of prompt learning is provided and seems to work in practice. \n- The experiment is designed well with a series of relevant baseline methods, a detailed ablation study, and necessary model discussions."

The main goal of this work is to leverage prompt tuning to avoid inefficient nested gradient calculation on large models; yet the backbones used in the experiment are too small to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. *Table 2* also exacerbates the above concern, where all the methods actually report a comparable training/adaption time. \n- The prompt poster is inconsistent through Eqs (1), (4), and (6). It remains confusing 1) where the meta prompt is sampled from and 2) what parameters are used in optimizing the prompt posterior. Is $p(s)$ in (1) the prompt prior or the posterior, or should it be written as $p(s|D)$? In meta-training, should the method sample prompt from the prior or the learned posterior? Comparing (4) and (6), is $q(s)$ optimized through $\\phi$ or $\\theta$?\n- It lacks strong empirical evidence to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian meta-prompt. From Table 3, the probabilistic formulation of the meta-prompt did not show a significant improvement. How about directly learning $s$ through a MAML approach? \n- The lit review is insufficient. Some relevant works, e.g., Probabilistic Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, should be clearly discussed in the paper."

The manuscript proposes two gradient-based update rules to update the task-specific prompts from the meta-prompts using the uncertainty captured by the standard deviations of the posteriors of the meta-prompts (hence why the proposed method is called uncertainty-aware prompted meta-learning).

I understood that the proposed two gradient-based update rules (in eq. (11)) are not designed to directly optimize the something derived from a full Bayesian model including the meta-prompts and task-specific prompts (like eq. (6)). The fact that the two update rules takes different inputs from the posteriors of the meta-prompts (the hard modulation takes the means and the standard deviations, but the soft modulation takes only the standard deviations) makes both update rules look more ad hoc. \n\nI think the manuscript could be improved in presentation. There are missing details and typos in the main text. For example:\n1)  The exact definition of the Gaussian distributions for the meta-prompts is not given in the main text. (as well as the definition of the standard deviation of d-th dimension of the meta-prompt, \\sigma_d). I could find some descriptions in the appendix, but I think these descriptions should be included in the main text for easier reading. \n2) In Section 5.2 (RQ2), the figure and table are referenced incorrectly (Figure 1 and Table 1?); what is the exact definition of the (weighted) KL-term considered in this section? Could it be eq. (4)? What is the exact meaning of the removal of the Bayesian treatment?        \n\nMinor comments:\nFigure 1 is not directly mentioned in the main text? \nThe symbol \\mathcal{L} was introduced as a loss function but also was used as the lower bound (which should be maximized) in eq. (6). Please also check eq. 5 (the relationship between the loss function and the likelihood)."

However, in the experimental result section, the improvements in the computation time do not look significant compared to the baseline (e.g., MAML) for the choice of the backbone network (e.g., Conv4). This could lead to the misunderstanding that the improvements reported in the experimental results are a matter of implementation (e.g., code optimization). The datasets may not be large enough to contrast the improvements in the computation time of the methods? \n\nIn Section 5.2 (RQ2), what did you intend to show the performance changes in the dimension of the meta prompts? It does not clear from the text. How can we understand this pattern in terms of Bayesian learning? In the current version of the manuscript, the figures just say that the dimension of the meta prompts is also the hyperparameter to be tuned by the users."
