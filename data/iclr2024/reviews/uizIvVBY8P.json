                "value": "Many anomaly detection papers assume that only normal instances are present in the training, and train the model unsupervised.\nHowever, in the real world, there are situations where even a few labeled abnormal instances are available.\nIn this case, studies have shown that even a very small number of anomalies can significantly improve the performance of the detector.\nIn addition, anomaly detectors are often trained under the assumption that the data distribution is stationary, but in real-world deployments, the distribution changes over time.\nTherefore, the authors propose a supervised anomaly detection method using continual learning.\nThe method consists of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and a binary classifier.\nThe VAE uses the reconstruction error to determine whether the input data is an unseen anomaly, and the binary classifier determines whether the input data is a seen anomaly, and calculates the anomaly score by aggregating the results of both models.\nIn addition, the VAE's decoder is used to generate data, which is then used for generative replay to prevent catastrophic forgetting in continual learning."

The authors naturally integrated supervised anomaly detection with continual learning.\n- The proposed method works with various types of input data, such as images and tabular data.\n- It is impressive that the method utilizes CVAE and a binary classifier to learn the process of generating rare abnormal instances by gradient descent, which is then used for generative replay."

                "value": "The main weakness is that experimental results do not sufficiently support the superiority of this method.\n\n- On tabular datasets such as UNSW, bank, and credit, the model does not significantly outperform the other baselines. In many cases, the performance is similar to that of the binary classifier, suggesting that the performance is due to the binary classifier included in the method rather than the proposed method.\n- The experimental baselines are too simple. BC and VAE are components of the proposed method, and there are many methods that might outperform DevNet and Deep SAD, at least in the image domain (Liu et al., 2023). Many anomaly detection methods in the image domain are not designed for continual learning, but since EWC and A-GEM can be applied, it would be meaningful if the proposed method outperforms in this setting.\n- In the image domain, the proposed method shows better performance than other baselines, but it seems that experiments on larger datasets are needed to show the practicality of the proposed method. The method was only tested on FMNIST and MNIST with MLP structure, but it would be useful to test it on larger datasets such as CIFAR10 and CelebA.\n---\n**Liu et al.** [Deep Industrial Image Anomaly Detection: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11514). *arXiv*, 2023"
