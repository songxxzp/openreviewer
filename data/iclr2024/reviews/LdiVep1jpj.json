                "value": "The paper lacks reference to a number of highly relevant related work that develops a context for the current paper. Here are some places (non-exhaustive list) where I think a citation is needed, with specific recommendations:\n* Section 1 first paragraph: cite something for Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Although this is folk wisdom, a citation is required for the claim \"MCMC is not practical for large learning architectures that often contain billions of parameters.\"\n* Section 1 second paragraph: cite something for mean-field variational inference (MFVI). MFVI didn't appear out of thin air. The development/popularization of MFVI is often attributed to [1-3].\n* Section 1.2 last sentence: stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) was independently developed by [4-6], where the use of SGVB for general Bayesian inference is commonly attributed to [4,5]. I suspect the intended citation here was Kingma and Welling [6]?\n* Section 2.1 first sentence: cite something for variational inference. In general, people cite these two well-known reviews [7,8].\n\nProbably due to the issue above, the paper misses a very important line of related works:\n* Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RMQC) for variational inference [9]\n* RQMC and stochastic quasi-Newton optimization for variational inference [10]\n\nWhile I'm not claiming that the method lacks novelty, this paper does not do a good job of putting the work in the context of this line of work. Does this method improve over these works? Is it different from the (randomized) quasi-Monte Carlo schemes that are used in these works? This leads me to the next point.\n\nThe choice of baselines and the overall design of the experiments makes the conclusion of the experiments unclear. In particular, the experiments do not appear to be doing an apple-to-apple comparison. Also, some experimental details are missing.\n* Variational inference is fundamentally a method for approximating the posterior. How was the joint likelihood obtained here? Was a prior set on the parameters of these models? Was an improper flat prior set on the parameters? What were the hyperparameters? It is, in fact, known that the choice of prior in deep learning models affects the result a lot [11].\n* The paper only compares against the following combinations: RASP + QNVB, MC + SGVB, MC + QNVB, QMC + QNVB. Why was RASP + SGVB not compared against? Also, the closely related works based on randomized QMC [9,10] and the QNVB algorithm proposed in [10] should also have been included.\n\n\n### Minor Comments\n* When denoting the variational approximation q, it is non-standard to denote conditioning on $\\varphi$. This is because the variational parameters $\\varphi$ are not considered to be random variables (their probability density has not been defined)\n* Section 1.1 third paragraph second from the last sentence \u201c... Hessian diagonal of the training loss, which can be expensive to compute.\u201d I believe saying that it is noisy is more accurate. In fact, noisy estimates are cheap to obtain, as shown by [12].\n* Section 2.2 last sentence: is there any evidence that alternative integration schemes scale better in terms of dimensionality? Because quasi-Monte Carlo methods, while converging faster with respect to the number of samples, have an explicit dimension dependence, unlike regular Monte Carlo. I suspect RASP would have similar behavior, although it is hard to tell since the author did not present a convergence bound akin to those in the QMC literature. Nonetheless, when the number of samples is small, I am not sure if the method can be claimed to be scalable in terms of dimension.\n\n### References\nI am not the author of nor affiliated with any of the references below:\n1.

What does squaring mean here?\n- p3: In the first paragraph of Sec 2.3 f: R^d \\mapsto \\R should use \\to rather than \\mapsto.\n- p4: \"For quadrature formulas that obtain second-order exactness (integrating all quadratic total-degree polynomials exactly) over multivariate Gaussians, the evaluation nodes are called sigma points.\" It would be good to note that sigma point terminology is far from universal and only really used in non-linear filtering literature.\n- p4: Given McNamee & Stenger (1967) and other old fully symmetric quadrature formulae, I doubt that Uhlmann (1995) was the first to design a second-order accurate quadrature rule.\n- p9: The description of QMC in Section 5 is rather misleading (as is labelling some alternative methods as QMC methods in Figure 4): QMC methods share nothing common with MC methods beyond the fact that they use uniform integration weights w_k = 1/n.
