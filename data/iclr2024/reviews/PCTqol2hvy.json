Worry not!, here is how to fix this issue:\n\n1. the curse of dimensionality is not only something that MLPs experience, but every (reasonable) class of function approximators which are uniformly approximating in the Lipschitz ball on some compact subset of a metric space.  Indeed, this is due to metric entropy limitations and the result is essentially due to Kolmogorov [1].  I think the authors should add 1 sentence at the end of page 2 to explain how this is a **generic** problem, and that the reader should expect this to **always** be the case.\n\n2. By the same token as (1), above, the reason which people consider speacialized classes of functions as a viable way to circumvent the curse of dimensionality is again rooted in metric entropy number arguments.  Indeed, [1] or even [2] show that the metric entropy (which is a non-linear notion of comprehensibility of a function class), or even linear notions such as Kolmogorov linear widths, are not cursed by dimensionality for smooth classes.  Indeed, the metric entropy of the unit ball in $C^k$ wrt the uniform topology is $\\Theta(\\varepsilon^{-r/d})$ so one can expect that the optimal (non-linear) approximator can achieve such rates.  These ideas should be communicated to the reader atop page $3$ so that it does not seem that consider \"special functions classes\" is a \"magic trick\" :)  \n\nFyi, the relationship between linear and non-linear measures of compressibility (the above which I mention) are given by Carl in their wonderful paper [3].\n\n3. There similar reason justified why the MLPs with super expressive activation in the following paragraph.  Namely, due to the (near) discontinuity of these classes, as a function of their parameters.  See [4].  So again, there is a simple, conceptual explanation for why these approaches work, but also why they should not be employed (since beating the curse of dimensionality in this way is only possibly by models whose input-output relation changes chaotically if the training data is perturbed only a tiny bit, since minor parameter changes result in dramatically different functions.  For instance, this is very clear in Theorem 1 of [5].\n\nI strongly feel that, points 1-3, should be communicated to the reader.  Albeit more conclusively due to the page limitations, if one even considers embarking on a meaningful discussion on the curse of dimensionality, and why/how it can be beaten.  More critically, the authors should, in such a discussion, highlight the reproductions of beating it; namely: the choice between an unstable model class (in its parameters) or a restriction of the functions which can be effectively approximated.\n\n\n-----\n\n**2) Suboptimal Rates Due to Polynomial Approximation and Not Quantization**\n\nThe proof strategy is akin to [6] (or its quantitative version in Proposition 53 - [7]) where one first approximates polynomials using the network class (here ResNet and in those papers deep but narrow MLPs), then one concludes by relating the polynomials to the target function being approximated (e.g. via quantitative Stone-Weirestrass theorems using Bernstein polynomials).  However, due to the \"triangle inequality\"-based argument these rates are suboptimal compared to the more modern quantization-based arguments of [8] which are possible for structures with recurrence/depth like MLPs ResNets.  For this reason, the rates which the authors derive are suboptimal by an exponential factor of $1/2$.  \n\nFor example, in Theorem 3.3 [9], the author exhibits the existence of an MLP with ReLU activation achieving the optimal (with the optimality given, for example, by Theorem 3.1 [9] ) depth of $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-r/(2d)}$ is required to approximate any function in the unit ball of $H^r$ (as opposed to the current manscript's ResNet guarantee of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-r/d})$.\n\n** 3) Minor Comment(s)**\n\nSome figures, e.g. Figure 6 in the appendix, seem not be expored as pdf or eps files making them pixelated.

                "value": "The paper studies approximation properties of residual networks under usual assumptions. Given a function space, input dimension, and a precision requirement, upper and lower bounds on the number of parameters of a ResNet architecture are studied. These bounds are derived to ensure the function family parameterized a ResNet architecture is dense in the function space under the supremum norm. By extending a result by Yarotsky (2017), a lower bound for the size of a ReLU network which approximates a multivariate product function is first derived. Since there is always a ReLU network which represents a ResNet, a lower bound in ReLU networks also serves as a lower bound for ResNets. As the family of multivariate product function is a subset of polynomials, the lower bound derived is also applicable to polynomials. Then, upper bounds are derived for monomials, which is smaller by a factor of input dimension d compared to the upper bound on the family of ReLU networks. Next, the bound is extended to polynomials and the Sobolev space. The bound is also smaller by a factor of d compared to the one on ReLU networks. Finally, it was shown that any continuous piecewise linear function can be approximated by a ResNet with width $(d+1)$ when the depth $L$ is large enough. Then, the authors argue that ResNets can approximate any continuous function. A relation between ResNets and dynamic systems is also studied. By limiting the regularity of the outer function of the Kolmogorov representation of a continuous function, the authors show that any function in this special family can be approximated by ResNets in the uniform norm.\nIn addition to the above theoretical results, the authors also demonstrate the approximation ability of ResNets by changing their size in computer simulation where mean squared error is used to measure the approximation capability."

The upper bounds for monomial and polynomials (Theorem 3 and 4) in this paper are not surprising in the sense that any layer in a ReLU network can be configured to implement a d-dimensional identity function if the width is sufficiently large. Since a $d$-dimensional identity function can be represented by a layer of $2d$ ReLU units, a smaller upper bound (for approximating monomials) by a factor of $d$ is expected. The upper bound given in Theorem 5 is the same as the bound given in Theorem 1 by Yarotsky (2017). Although this is for ResNet, it is not surprising using the above argument. The large constant d is also hidden in the big O notation. This piece of result can be more interesting if the authors can show the dependency on d explicitly and demonstrate that it is also some factors of reduction similar to case of monomials. \n\n2. For the lower bound (Theorem 2), it is not very useful given the product function is limited. The authors give a comprehensive discussion but the result extending this bound to the space of continuous functions is missing. It is good to discuss existing results, but a comparison is expected.\n\n3. In Theorem 6, the upper bound for approximating continuous functions grows with the input dimension given that the width is bounded by $(d+1)$, provided the depth is sufficiently large. Such dependency on the input dimension is usually not friendly given that many neural networks in applications directly work on raw data. A dimension-independent bound (reference below) can be derived when the number of pieces in the continuous piecewise linear function is known.\n\n>Chen, Kuan-Lin, Harinath Garudadri, and Bhaskar D.

Since the approximation quality is measured by the uniform norm, it seems not reasonable to measure the mean squared error.

                "value": "The paper aims to provide a theoretical understanding of the expressive power of Resnets. The authors study this question w.r.t. function approximation. They first start with d-dimensional monomials of degree p, then they study smooth functions that are differentiable up to degree r, and they also provide a class of lower bounds. Their main results are to derive bounds on the number of tunable weights needed or sufficient for the function approximation. The authors' results showcase the benefits of ResNets compared to ReLU nets in terms of necessary tunable weights. \n\nThe main idea behind the results is to show a connection between ResNets and their feedforward counterparts. The authors show that ResNets can be viewed as a sparse FNN. The authos also provide specific constructions that show how to approximate classes of functions mentioned before with a bounded (and they provide the bounds) number of tunable weights."

                "value": "Overall i like the paper however, I find the most important weakness to be w.r.t. novelty and technical innovation.\n\n-the main concern is that many of the ideas/constructions upon which the paper relies to prove their results have been known in prior works. This is the case with the proposed lower bound for example. The most interesting observation I would say is the implementation of quadratics \"x^2\" and product \"xy\" using ResNets, but I don't find this contribution enough for ICLR."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Q: A related interesting question is about the depth-width tradeoffs for ResNets. Perhaps this is something that follows from your work on just the tunable weights, but as far as I can tell it's not obvious. Given that there are many results for FNNs and their depth/width tradeoffs,  I believe it is important to highlight this too."
