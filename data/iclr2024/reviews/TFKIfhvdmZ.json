            "questions": {
                "value": "To be fully transparent, this is the third time I'm reviewing this paper, after ICML23 and NeurIPS23. Each time I was in favor of accepting the paper because I believe the proposed algorithm is truly interesting, but each time the authors failed to convince some reviewers, mostly due to some writing issues and insufficient focus on the comparison between TD3GA and PPGA. I hope this time could be the right time with a further writing effort that I will try to contribute to below. So my review will mostly focus on writing aspects, but keep in mind that the TD3GA vs PPGA comparison is crucial and not even mentioned in the main paper.\n\nAbstract: \n\n- \"Existing QD-RL approaches have been constrained to sample efficient, deterministic off-policy RL algorithms and/or evolution strategies, *and struggle with highly stochastic environments*.\" -> the rest of the abstract makes it clear that you switch to on-policy RL, but it does not make clear that you will solve the highly stochastic environments issue. Do you really need to mention that? If yes, you need to mention how you will solve it.\n\n- \"propose several changes\" -> changes wrt what? It is a weird formulation, you have a new algorithm, you propose new things, no need to mention that...\n\nIntroduction:\n\nparag 1 is OK (maybe a ref at the end of the sentence finishing with \"high-quality solutions\" or merge the sentence with the next ones, where the references are).\n\nparag 2 has several issues:\n\n- \"For example, all QD-RL algorithms for locomotion to date use non-differentiable measure functions, which in most cases prevents direct RL optimization.\"\n\n-> At this point, the standard ML reader does not know what a measure function is, \n\n-> I don't agree that having non-differentiable measure functions prevents direct RL optimization. RL methods are precisely good at approximating some gradients when they are not available. Even if you want to discuss this with me, this sentence is ill-placed, as the standard reader cannot get its meaning.\n\n- \"Prior methods that investigated combining DQD\". You should re-explain the acronym, doing it once in the abstract is not enough.\n\n- \"However, given the gap in performance between standard RL and QD-RL algorithms in terms of best-performing policy, we believe that DQD algorithms, under a different formulation more synergistic with its underlying mechanisms, can close this gap. We instead believe that one or both of existing DQD and RL methods must be adapted to each other in order to maximally exploit their synergy.\"\n\n-> Both sentences say more or less the same thing, I suspect this is a last-minute-no-reread edition issue.\n\n- \"maintain a single search point within the archive that\" -> at this point, the standard ML reader does not know what the search point is, and what the archive is.\n\n- \"The question we aim to answer becomes clear through this high-level view \u2013 can we better adapt DQD algorithms to challenging RL domains by exploiting its synergy with PPO?\" -> the third time you mention exploiting this synergy in the same paragraph...\n\nI afraid that, with all the points above, you have already lost the standard reader, who won't read your paper any further. Instead, you must give a high-level view of PPGA from the RL viewpoint, with the RL vocabulary (a search point is a policy, etc.).\n\n- As contribution (1), you propose an implementation ... : I see no link to a source code in the paper, so you should not mention such a contribution [EDIT: OK, the source code is in the supplementary, forget this comment]\n\n- What a \"non-stationary QDRL task\"? \n\n- Contrib (4) sould be reformulated with the RL vocabulary. Otherwise, rather submit your paper to GECCO, as I already advised you twice...\n\n- where T is (the) episode length\n\n- the deep neural network represents *a* state-action mapping, not necessarily the optimal one.\n\n### Deep RL background:\n\n- About your Deep RL background, it is close to good (there is no major mistake), but it is still confusing for the non-expert and you can do a better job.\n- I think the point you want to make is that PPO is on-policy. In the current classification, it is not in the \"on-policy\" part, but in the \"trust region\" part\n- Mentioning actor-critic in the on-policy part the way you do brings confusion. It is true that A2C and A3C are actor-critic and on-policy, but DDPG, TD3, SAC and others are actor-critic too and they are off-policy.\n- I think what you need is the distinction between policy-based methods (Reinforce, A2C, TRPO, PPO) which derive their gradient from the policy and are on-policy, and value-based methods (DQN, DDPG, TD3, SAC, ...) which derive their gradient from the critic and are off-policy.\n\nSee e.g. Nachum, O., Norouzi, M., Xu, K., & Schuurmans, D. (2017). Bridging the gap between value and policy based reinforcement learning. Advances in neural information processing systems, 30.\n\n### Other points\n\n- the equation with L(theta) should finish with a dot.\n\n- In the QD optimization section, don't you want to mention QDRL in the last parag?\n\n- \"gradients around the search point \u2207 1 , ..., \u2207 \u03bb\" -> gradients \u2207 1 , ..., \u2207 \u03bb around the search point. \n\n- Again, why not call the search point \"the current policy\"? The same for \"solutions\", they are policies.\n\n- \"some minimum threshold\". Why call this a minimum threshold? Threshold for what? I rather see it as an exploration bonus...\n\n- \"in the direction of the archive that is least\" -> doesn't this also take performance into account?\n\n- In 2.4: \"In prior work (ref) ... In this work\" -> You should not write this in a way that let us know who you are. *Your paper could be desk-rejected for that. Actually, this is transparent given the (too) many self-references, but you have to follow the rules*.\n\n- In 3.2, I'm afraid the claim that trust region methods provide formal guarantees on the quality of the gradient estimates is wrong. The proof in TRPO comes with unrealistic assumptions that are always violated in experimental RL work.\n\n- You use the MMPs as rewards to optimize. So it means that your algorithm is looking for as much leg contact as possible. Shouldn't it be looking for as much \"leg contact diversity\" as possible instead? This is unclear. Could you clarify?\n\n- \"We additionally modify the computation of the policy gradient into a batched policy gradient method, where intermediate gradient estimates of each function w.r.t. policy params only flow back to the parameters corresponding to respective individual policies during minibatch gradient descent.\" -> This part is very unclear to me, a small diagram or equations would probably help.\n\n- jacobian -> Jacobian\n\n- There are many considerations about using constant variance or not. Actually in the literature, there are 3 options: using a constant variance, using a tunable variance which is not a function of states, and using a tunable state-dependent variance where the NN outputs a mean and a variance for each state. The second one is used e.g. in the TRPO paper, see Fig. 3 here: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/schulman15.pdf\nI think you need to further study this point, your work is not convincing in that respect. The fact that you \"disable gradient flow\" to the variance parameter or not depending on the environment is not satisfactory at all.\n\n- About Section 3.3, I think the first paragraph which establishes that xNES is a better option that CMA-ES in your context could be moved in an appendix together with the corresponding sutdy, as this is not central to your story. You could make profit of the earned space to add a paragraph about the comparison between TD3GA and PPGA (with selected results), which is much more important.\n\n- At the end of 3.4, you mention the outer optimization loop, but the inner/outer loop distinction has not been made explicit in the main paper.\n\n- \"We use an archive learning rate of 0.1, 0.15, 0.1, and 1.0...\" -> The fact that there is such a learning rate is not explained before.\n\n- All experimental figures and tables make a poor use of space. By reworking this aspect you can both save more space and make your results more readable and explicit.\n\n- In Fig. 4, using +/- one std as variance information is a bad practice in RL, where the variance is generally not Gaussian. See \nPatterson, A., Neumann, S., White, M., & White, A. (2020). Draft: Empirical Design in Reinforcement Learning. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 1. and Agarwal, R., Schwarzer, M., Castro, P. S., Courville, A. C., & Bellemare, M. (2021). Deep reinforcement learning at the edge of the statistical precipice. Advances in neural information processing systems, 34, 29304-29320, the latter comes with a useful visualization library.\n\n- Figure 4 is cited before fig 3, you should reorder\n\n- \"We present a new method, PPGA, which is one of the first QD-RL methods to leverage on-policy RL,\" -> one of the first, so what are the others?\n\n- \"We show that DQD algorithms and on-policy RL have emergent synergies that make them work particularly well with each other.\" -> I'm sorry but this point does not emerge clearly from reading the paper. You should have somewhere a paragraph about the investigations of these synergies.\n\n- Your paper needs slightly more than 9 pages. Again, *it could have been desk-rejected for that*. Please follow the rules."

This paper shows that there are potentially many different sets of behaviors that could achieve optimal or near optimal performance.

These strategies can all be characterized by some measurements that are computed on trajectories. Figure 1 demonstrates this concept quite well. It plots two different measures with a heatmap of how well the policy at each point fulfilled the main objective (locomotion)\n\nThere are already prior works which establish this idea of characterizing policies with measures and attempting to maximize diversity in measure space. There are works that focus on differentiable measures and works that use non differentiable measures. This paper considers non-differentiable measures and approximates them using the bellman equation.\n\nSeveral value functions are learned which each approximate the instantaneous measure functions (deltas) and the overall objective function f. ***Each measure function is the average of the instantaneous measurement (delta) in each state.***\n\nSince all value functions are differentiable then a gradient of policy parameters with respect to a linear combination of these value functions can be obtained.

                "value": "The authors propose Proximal Policy Gradient Arborescence (PPGA), a new QD-RL algorithm that builds on a DQD algorithm, specifically CMA-MAEGA, with an on-policy RL algorithm, specifically PPO, as the gradient estimator. To make this integration more stable, the authors propose multiple changes: 1) replace the CMA-ES in CMA-MAEGA with a more contemporary xNES algorithm to update the distributions, as a solution to accommodate the noisy RL objective, 2) use PPO with weighted rewards to walk the search point to avoid gradient staleness. The authors also implement a vectorized PPO for efficient gradient estimation.\n\nEmpirically, the author demonstrates that PPGA achieves much higher quality solutions compared with previous QD-RL baselines with matching coverage rates in multiple Mujoco locomotion domains."

                "value": "- The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.\n- The proposed techniques to accommodate the integration issues of PPO are all logically and empirically justified.\n- There are substantial empirical improvements over previous baselines, especially in terms of solution qualities. As a side note, I do find the introduction of the Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function provides a very intuitive way of evaluating the solution quality and diversity."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- At the beginning of Sec 3.2, the authors claim \"Being an approximate trust region method, it provides some formal guarantees on the quality of the gradient estimates\". Could the authors expand on this and more formally establish this claim? This claim is an important reason of choosing PPO since there are other parallelizable RL algorithm choices such as IMPALA[1].\n- I have a slight concern that all the ablation studies show a dramatic decrease in performance. Could finding a better set of hyperparameters instead of inheriting the PPGA hyperparameters help?\n\n[1] Espeholt, Lasse et al. \"IMPALA: Scalable Distributed Deep-RL with Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architectures.\" Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). 2018."
