To take your meme example: Doctor prescribes S, which was prescribed due to X, and the resulting treatment as a result of the patient not adhering to the prescription is T. The resulting outcome is Y, with measurement error too. So wouldn't the DAG be: X->S | S+U->T | X + T + eps -> Y\n- Is ATTNet different from TransTEE, because the actual name from the paper.\n- The experimental results section is disappointing. On synthetic datasets, unless you have a high measurement (which I'm not sure if completely reasonable but regardless), the non-VI approaches perform basically on par. But semi-synthetic really shows the this method is ineffective: VI underperforms significantly. And only reason to use NN is when there is when there is high-dimensions, so not sure what the point of this method is then.\n\nMinor Comments:\n- Plots are hard to read when printed. Perhaps less graphs, but bigger?"

To do this, it formulates a probabilistic model treating the unobserved true treatment as a latent variable. This allows measurement error to be handled in a principled Bayesian way. To approximate the posterior, it uses a variational inference approach to avoid expensive MCMC methods. The method can leverage state-of-the-art neural networks for ADRF estimation in the error-free setting by integrating them into the variational framework. Extensive simulation studies and experiments on semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework compared to recent nonparametric methods."

Being able to handle measurement error robustly significantly expands the applicability of these methods. The flexible modeling framework could pave the way for practical use in areas like medicine, social sciences, and policy evaluation."

Could identifiability improved by the use of some auxiliary information, similarly to https://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/khemakhem20a/khemakhem20a.pdf?\n- Plots are very small, please update the fonts to make it more readable. Also mark your method as \"ours\" to make sure the reader sees what they compare.\n- nitpick: Data generation model is usually called data generating process. Not sure if you should change to this, but worth mentioning it.\n- Figure 2. it's common to also add the parameters of the models in the plot (\\theta_y, \\theta_t, \\phi). e.g. check also the original VAE paper.\n- Figure 3. What does MiM stands for?\n- Metrics: \"we employ the widely recognized metric\" - can you please provide citation?\n- \"this metric quantifies the proximity of our predicted outcomes to the true potential outcomes when considering covariates and the corresponding treatment\" -> from the definition of the metric this doesn't quantify the error for the corresponding treatment but for all possible treatments in T. Please update the text.\n- Figure 4. True response seems same between all plots, is this correct? So in that sense it's one simulation dataset but for different noise distributions? \n- Table 1. Why APE is 0.0 +- 0.0? The model seem to have high AMSE error but no error (!) on APE. Would be curious to understand what happened there.\n- Appendix B.4 last sentence. Fix the citation (?)"
