Specifically, REX is shown to extend the capabilities of Anchors, LIME, and Kernel-SHAP. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated on two datasets using metrics including coverage/precision, accuracy, and AUROC. Notably, coverage/precision is also employed as a measure of human interpretability.

Algorithm for \"Extending Vocabularies\": The paper would benefit from a more detailed explanation of how 1-D and 2-D predicates are extracted from the model inputs, as this is a core component of REX. Additional analyses on the algorithm for extending vocabularies would be beneficial. Specifically, do all 1-D and 2-D predicates positively impact explanations? Including more examples beyond those discussed in Section 3.1 could strengthen the paper's argument for the advantages of REX. Additionally, incorporating another textual dataset could bolster claims regarding REX's generalizability.\n\n2. Details on Human Evaluations: The section on human evaluations lacks some details. For instance, is the experimental design a within-groups setup? If so, biases could arise from the order in which explanations from different methods are presented. What is the precise procedure for the user study? Does each set consist of ten new sentences used specifically for that test block? Furthermore, exploring challenging tasks, such as instances where the model makes incorrect predictions, would offer additional insights into human understanding of model reasoning. If humans can also make \u201cwrong predictions\u201d made by the model, it is very convincing that users understand the model's reasoning.\n\n3.

                "value": "* **Weakness #1: Clarity.** My primary critique of this work is that I found the present draft difficult to understand.  The notation used was not sufficiently explained, and I found the authors' descriptions of their methodology and experiments to be severely underspecified.  Unless these details are clarified, I do not believe this draft is ready to be published in its present state. Specifically:\n  * Section 2 (Notation). The description that you provided in the second paragraph is confusing, and does not clarify exactly how to interpret the notation.  Specifically, what is $d$: is it the order in which the token appears in the sentence? What is the minus sign notation (what is $Pos_g$, and how does it differ from $Pos_f$)? What do the numbers mean (e.g., why is there a 2 in the statement $Pos_{fails} - Pos_{never} >= 2$?)\n  * Section 3. Your notation is under-specified. It may be helpful in this section to clarify what the 'features' of the example inputs you presented are (e.g., what are the 'features' of the sentence input \"Bob is not a bad boy\")? Is $f_j$ in this case the token that appears at index $j$ in the sentence, or something else? Similarly, do your feature predicates $p_j$ compare the value of token at index $j$ to some threshold (e.g. \"the token at timestep $t$ = 'fails'\", or something else? (EDIT: After reading Section 3.1, it seems like $f_j$ is the value of the token at index $j$?  Can you clarify?)\n  * Section 3.2. \"Extending vocabularies: I don't understand what is described in this paragraph. What do you mean by 'serve as a feature of an input', and a 'method to evaluate the predicate on a given input'? Do you mean that you construct a new set of indicators for each original datapoint where you evaluate whether the predicate holds for that datapoint, and then learn each \"surrogate model\" using the set of original features plus the predicates?\n  * Section 3.3. I am confused from the explanation provided about how the perturbation model that you've described is used for each of the individual explanation methods.  It is unclear to me how this perturbation method, evaluates the possible importance of all of the possible predicates (from the many possibilities that exist).  Take LIME as an example. I am confused about how being able to generate new datapoints where features are \"switched\" (for example, say we switch $f_j = c_j$ and $f_i = c_i$, allows us to assign an \"importance score\" to, for example, the predicate $f_j = c$ AND $f_i = c_i$ AND $i - j >= 1$.  Can you clarify exactly how you calculate the importance scores for each of the 1D and the 2D temporal predicates using such perturbation methods?\n  * Section 4.3. Can you clarify how you assigned participant to explanation conditions in the user study? Did a single participant only see explanations from 1 of {Anchor, Anchor*}?  Did you present a single \"test\", and then ask them to simulate the model on 10 sentences, several different times (so elicited 50 total predictions), or show all 5 \"tests\" right away and then collect 10 predictions per user?\n  * Section 4.3. Can you provide screenshots of your study interface (e.g., how you presented the Anchors explanations to users)? I wonder if simply highlighting the most important tokens identified by Anchors within the existing sentence, like in Figure 4 of [1] (rather than just showing them the rule) may result in similar performance increases as showing them the Anchors* explanation.\n* **Weakness #2: No comparison to popular existing post-hoc methods for sequential data.** In your Related Work and in the paper's Introduction, you compare post-hoc feature attribution methods like LIME to DFA methods that explain RNNs.  However, there have been many other post-hoc explanation method techniques that have been proposed to explain sequence models like transformers (most notably, attention [2]). Can you provide additional motivation for the benefits of your proposed method over other existing popular methods?\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08450.pdf\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04626"

Why does failure to learn the true regular expression imply that the network is difficult to explain?\n* Figure 2: I am confused about this example.  My understanding is that the anomaly data point is 428, and both Anchors and Anchors* identify only datapoints before this anomaly point.  Wouldn't a more suitable explanation include both datapoints that come before, and after point 428?  Is the problem set-up here that you must predict if timestep $x_t$ is an anomaly, given only the observations that came before it?\n* Section 2, nit: isn't it more appropriate for the local explanation to be a function of $f$, i.e., $g(x, f)$?\n* Section 3. \"Anchors is a conjunction which must evaluate to true on $x$\".  Can you define what a \"conjunction\" is inline?  What do you mean by \"evaluate to true on $x$\"?\n* Section 3.1. Can you provide intuition for the explanation with the \"I hate that man\u2026\" example?  Why does it make sense for \"j >= 3\" to be the explanation? This seems less important than \"but\" coming before \"love\", or after \"hate\"?\n* Section 4.1. Can you provide more detail about the anomaly detection ECG dataset? Is there only a single \"feature\" being measured at different timesteps? What is the prediction task here (is it given the measurements $x_1, \u2026, x_{(T - 1)}$, to predict if $x_T$ is anomalous)?\n* Section 4.2. Your paper says that \"REX improves the coverage by 98.2%\".  Do you mean that $1.982 x = y$, where $x$ is the average coverage across all of the models and explanation methods before REX, and $y$ is the average coverage across all of the models and explanation methods after REX?\n* Section 4.2. I don't understand the intuition for REX's runtime. You state, \"REX does not require a larger number of sampled instances\".  Why is this the case?\n* For your \"it's not a bad journey at all\" example in 4.2, I think your explanation is incorrect (the token \"good\" doesn't appear in the original sentence).\n* Section 4.3. You state that users \"would ignore input length constraints\" when \"misusing [the original] Anchors' explanations\".  But unless I am mistaken, the original Anchors did not include predicates over the input's length? Can you clarify what you mean by this?'"
