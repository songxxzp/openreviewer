The authors propose  an edge contraction method applied to time-stamped graphs, which compresses the evolving graph to a reasonable size using node representations. At each time step, tasks are learned on the coarsened graph, and the learned representations further assist in the next time step's coarsening process. The paper also proposes Node Fidelity Preservation to retain important nodes and prevent them from being compressed. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Would this approach still have the same issue in terms of the representation power? I hope the author could clarify a bit on this point.\n- Will the proposed method be affected by the time interval of the dataset?\n- The author utilized average forgetting as the metric, which is defined as the maximum forgetting observed thus far. It would be beneficial if the author could also compare long-term forgetting and short-term forgetting with the baseline. This comparison is relevant because various continual learning practices may have distinct requirements.\n\n**Minor comments**:\n\n- In Appendix A, \"GraphCoarseninAlgorithm\" should be \"GraphCoarseningAlgorithm\"."

For example, [3] does not split the growing graphs into independent graphs, [4] may also be a related work. Similar works are abundant and the authors are enouraged to do a thorought literature review.  \n\n2. The datasets are split according to time, then how do the classes increment? Does each time stamp necessarily contain new classes?\n\n3. According to Table 3 in the appendix, the number of classes are very small. For DBLP and ACM, 4 classes are used to construct 10 tasks. Then many tasks are actually containing same classes, and it is not a class-incremental situation with large distribution gap. \n\n\n4. Is the proposed method related to graph pooling methods? Graph pooling methods seem to be able to maintain a low computation burden while considering the node features at the same time.\n\n[1] Carta, Antonio, et al. \"Catastrophic forgetting in deep graph networks: an introductory benchmark for graph classification.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.11750 (2021).\n\n[2] Zhang, Xikun, Dongjin Song, and Dacheng Tao. \"Cglb: Benchmark tasks for continual graph learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 13006-13021.\n\n[3] Feng, Yutong, Jianwen Jiang, and Yue Gao. \"Incremental Learning on Growing Graphs.\" (2020).\n\n[4] Das, Bishwadeep, and Elvin Isufi. \"Graph filtering over expanding graphs.\" 2022 IEEE Data Science and Learning Workshop (DSLW).

As a rehearsal-based method, it preserves graph topology information and captures the correlations between two tasks. To preserve graph topology information, a graph coarsening algorithm based on Node Representation Proximity (RePro) serves as the main component in the framework. RePro leverages node embedding from the first GNN layers and calculates the cosine similarity for connected nodes and merges nodes with high similarity, which satisfy the requirements of feature similarity, neighbor similarity and geometry closeness.  It also preserves representative nodes in the buffer for keeping important path information. Using GCN as backbones, it demonstrates the effectiveness by showing better experimental results using CL methods such as regularized-based methods (EWC,TWP\u2026) and rehearsal-based methods(ER variants) on three datasets.
