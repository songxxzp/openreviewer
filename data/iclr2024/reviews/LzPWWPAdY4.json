LoftQ is inspired by QLoRA and aims to improve over it by providing a better quantisation and better initialisation for the low-rank adapter weight matrices.  \n\nFor background: LoRA makes the assumption that the difference between pre-trained and fine-tuned weights can be approximated by a low-rank matrix, i.e. $W_{ft*} = W_{pt} + AB^T$. \n\nThe core contribution of this work relies on the observation that QLoRA quantises $W_{pt}$ but still relies on the default LoRA initialisation which assumes a non-quantised matrix $W_{pt}$.\n\nTo address this shortcoming, the authors propose an iterative LoRA-aware quantisation which jointly improves the quantisation of $W_{pt}$, making it more similar to the pre-trained weight, and the initialisation of $A$ and $B$ (as the authors note, QLoRA is a special case of their proposed algorithm). \n\nThe authors compare their proposed approach to QLoRA and full fine-tuning across several models and datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms QLoRA.\n\nIn addition to their main experiments, the authors provide ablations investigating their proposed approach in more detail.\n\n- Dettmers et al. 2023 - QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs"

An interesting ablation would be to discard $A_T$ and $B_T$ and use the default LoRA initialisation instead. This would tell us more about the importance of initialising $A_T$ and $B_T$ differently.\n- One of the findings in the QLoRA paper is that it is crucial to add LoRA adapters to every linear layer of the model (Figure 2 in the QLoRA paper). It could be interesting to run a similar ablation with your method. Given your improved initialisation, maybe it is sufficient to add LoRA adapters to fewer layers.\n- It could be interesting to study the difference in initialisation of the low-rank matrices more. Does your work provide insights into what makes a good LoRA initialisation and could these insights be potentially applied to non-quantised LoRA as well? \n\n\n**Typos and writing suggestions**\n\n- Introduction, second paragraph: \"It is predicated on the hypothesis ...\" \n    - You might want to use \"based\" instead of predicated\n- Discussion, LoftQ better than full precision LoRA: \"Such zero initialisation could cause the fine-tuning unstable\"\n    - This sentence needs rewriting"

The initialization process is iterative where the quantized matrix is obtained through a standarized quantization process and the lora quantized weights are obtained from a SVD decomposition.\n\nExperiments on encoder models (classification), encoder-decoder models (summarization), and decoder models (math reasoning, language modeling) are conducted and results are in favor of the LoftQ initialization."

Maybe 4 bit quantization does implicit regularization, and FP LoRA  was not regularized well enough? This would especially make a difference if the tasks are low dimensional. In other words, if a high capacity LLAMA 13B model is fine-tuned LoRA style on GSM8k, how did the authors ensure that the model was not overfitted?\n\n2) It would be nice to analyze number of epochs, and training steps required for baseline full precision LoRA and LoftQ. \n\n3) LoRA's original motivation stems from \"training efficiency\" while maintaining the inference cost the same as the base model. Conversely quantization's main motivation is inference efficiency. Keeping training efficiency aside, a good baseline maybe quantization aware fine-tuning (i.e. no LoRA), to establish upper bound on accuracy for LoftQ. \n\n4) It wasn't very fully clear but are the LoRA adaptors, A and B, quantized as well in LoftQ?"
