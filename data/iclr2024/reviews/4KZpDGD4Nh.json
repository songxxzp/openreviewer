I would have appreciated ablations in this paper, including ones that explored whether or not having both real vectors and a vector of symbolic attributes is actually helpful. What should the real vector capture that the symbolic attribute is not capturing, especially given that the rules of the evaluation domain seem to only rely on these attributes?\n\nW2. An additional note is that I would have appreciated more clarity of what information is given to the model, and whether other methods have access to the same information. From my understanding, a strong assumption is that the symbolic labeling module requires a predefined list of attributes that is important for the downstream task. I think in many downstream tasks this may not be reasonable to know a priori. Potentially, you can run experiments showing that with a superset of attributes, directly predicted by some foundation model, that you can still learn the correct correspondence to rules given this noise. \n\nW3. Similarly, are there assumptions made on how many rules there are in the evaluation domain? I understand that the rule is a learnable encoding, but is the amount of rules learned as well? One can imagine that the method discovers rules that are correct, but not optimal (e.g., decompose rules into many smaller rules that overfit to the train set). \n\nW4. I would have appreciated evaluation on a different domain, such as maybe Physion, and learn more complex and less obvious rules such as rigid and soft-body collisions, stable multi-object configurations, etc. In the block-pushing domain, it seems like the rules are tied to clear attributes such as shape and color, without having to further learn whether non-uniform combinations of these would lead to certain downstream effects. Also related to the known attributes assumption in W2."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There are two main weaknesses of the paper.\n\nFirst, the problem setting of object composition seems very contrived to me, for two reasons.\n- In the physical world, it is unclear what's a concrete example where such kind of metarules would apply. In particular, the authors are training the model on seeing two red blocks moving together and two green blocks moving together, and hope that the model would generalize to predict two blue blocks would also move together. Such kind of \"attribute-relationship\" based generalization doesn't seem natural to me. Arguably, this kind of generalization can be dangerous: two blocks can be stacked together; two cylinders can be stacked together, but not two spheres, in the physical world.\n- There is some serious machine learning identifiability issue with this setting. If the model does not have inductive biases in training, there is no way that it can generalize.\n--- Based on these two concerns, the arguments around object compositional generalization is weak.\n\nSecond, the model is only trained and evaluated on a fairly toy environment, and the downstream application to planning is only shown in a very simple setting. It is unclear how this approach can be generalized to more complicated scenarios.\n\nSlightly minor is that the paper missed some important related work along the direction of learning neuro-symbolic transition models. For example,\n- PDSketch: Integrated Planning Domain Programming and Learning https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05501\n- Learning Object-Oriented Dynamics for Planning from Text https://openreview.net/forum?id=B6EIcyp-Rb7\n\nThey are not exactly the same setting but a lot of the high-level ideas are definitely the same, including learning lifted transition rules, using factorized embeddings (colors, shapes, etc.) to represent objects.\n\nWhile I overall like the presentation of the paper---it's well-organized and overall good. I found the description of some details very unclear. In particular:\n- Page 3, the object composition part. I have to check the appendix and read through paragraphs/figures several times in order to understand what this object composition means. I think the name is not very descriptive. The authors should consider change it to a better name that describes such kind of \"metarules\" (e.g., two objects have relations if they share the same color) and present concrete examples in the main text.\n- Parge 4-5: the authors should keep the \"...\" in the sets. Otherwise it's very confusing to look at \"{c1, c2, cp}\"\n- The writing of the method section could be further improved by having a running example (and referring back to this example in 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3).\n\nFinally, the paper does not have a limitation discussion section.\n\nMinor notes on the writing: I think using CG as an acronym for \"compositional generalization\" is a bit uncommon. The term is easily confused with other concepts like \"computer graphics.\""
