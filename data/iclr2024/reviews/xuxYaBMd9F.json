However, it would be beneficial to understand whether the performance gap between SPADE and S4 is caused by adding Transformer blocks on top of the SSM module. Training SPADE with Hyena may not improve performance over Hyena while being better than SPADE with S4. In this case, the motivation for the paper will disappear.\n- I struggled to understand which SSM was used in SPADE (did I miss it?). It should be S4 based on the text. However, it would be helpful to name it in Section 3.2 explicitly.\n- The paper lacks reproducibility despite an extensive description of training within the text since no supplementary material with source code was released.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04933.pdf\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10866.pdf\n\nWhile at this point, I voted for rejecting this paper, I believe that flaws with baselines could be fixed.

SPADE integrates a state space model (SSM) into the bottom layer of a Transformer architecture, which enhances global information processing. This is complemented by local attention methods in the upper layers to handle local dependencies. The proposed method addresses the limitations of existing attention variants that struggle with long-range dependencies and computational inefficiency. SPADE demonstrates improved performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and various language modeling tasks. The architecture allows SPADE to scale efficiently and outperform baselines in both natural language understanding and generation tasks, with the additional benefit of being able to handle longer sequences than it was trained on due to the SSM's extrapolation capabilities."
