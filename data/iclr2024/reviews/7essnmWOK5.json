However, several methods perform attention across different dimensions (e.g., [1]) and there's little novelty in the mechanism used to learn such matrices end-to-end.\n* The architecture appears overly complicated compared to alternatives from the literature and such complexity is poorly justified (see minor comments).\n* The considered datasets have at most 3 channels which does not justify modeling intra-channel dependencies with a graph. As shown by the ablation study in Tab. 2, removing the intra-dependency learning module results in a decrease in performance that is not statistically significant by considering the reported standard deviations.\n* Empirical results on the existing traffic datasets are worse than those of much simpler baselines such as [2], which consists of a simple MLP with spatial and temporal embeddings.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n* Several claims are not supported by appropriate evidence. For example, in the introduction: \"These methods can provide acceptable results depending on circumstances, but they may also introduce a higher degree of uncertainty, which can impact the reliability of predictions\"; it is not clear what uncertainty the sentence is referring to and, at same time, how the introduced method should reduce uncertainty.\n* \"Even so, the temporal correlations regarding the changing spatial dependencies are not well-considered, which makes these methods ineffective in learning from dynamic graph topologies.\" There are a few papers that learn dynamic adjacency matrices using a mechanism similar to the one used here (e.g., [3]), but it is not clear how HSDGNN should be better than the current approaches.\n\nGiven the above, I cannot recommend acceptance.\n\n\n[1] Ma et al. \"CDSA: Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention for Multivariate, Geo-tagged Time Series Imputation\" arxiv 2019\\\n[2] Shao et al. \"Spatial-Temporal Identity: A Simple yet Effective Baseline for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting\" CIKM 2022\\\n[3] Liu et al. \"Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting with Temporal Polynomial Graph Neural Networks\" NeurIPS 2022\\"

HSDGNN captures the spatiotemporal dependencies among variables at two levels: attribute and variable.
