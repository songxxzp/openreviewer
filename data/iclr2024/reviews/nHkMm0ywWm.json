While previous Linear non-Gaussian variants assume either no-latent variable, specific position or the number of latent variables , the proposed method relaxes such assumptions. When reconstructing a causal graph, the authors use a set of variables called the atomic unit, which represents the basic building block of casual structures. The PO-LiNGAM identification procedure consists of three step: (Phase 1) : Identify a leaf node and its parents; (Phase 2): Discover atomic units; and (Phase 3) : Refine the atomic units. Discovering relationships between atomic units is based on theorems under GIN (Generalized Independent Noise) condition which is an existing graphical condition for identifying a latent hierarchical structure."

This approach actively utilizes linear transitivity to infer latent variables. The author clearly describes the entire process of the method, and helps the reader's understanding by showing various examples. A sufficient amount of experiments demonstrates the validity of the paper."

However, for the algorithm to work properly, each atomic unit must have a sufficient number of pure atomic unit children. It is difficult to say that this is not a strong condition. The authors are aware of this issue and presented relaxing this as future work. One thing to add is that the only explanation of notations in the paper is provided through table 1 in figure 1. It is difficult to clearly understand the notations just from the table. For example, in definition 3, the term 'pure atomic unit child' is used for the first time.

It considers a general scenario in which both measured and latent variables collectively form a partially observed causally sufficient linear system, allowing latent variables to be situated anywhere within the causal structure. The paper establishes a theoretical foundation, demonstrating that with the application of high-order statistics, the causal graph can be (almost) fully identified. This identification is achieved under the condition that each latent set contains a sufficient number of pure children, whether they are latent or measured variables. Importantly, this extends beyond LiNGAM, a model without latent variables.\n\nExpanding on the identification theorem, the paper introduces a systematic algorithm for identifying the causal graph. This algorithm involves three iteratively executed phases that sequentially identify latent variables and infer causal relationships among both latent and measured variables. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately recovering the causal structure, even when latent variables are influenced by measured variables."
