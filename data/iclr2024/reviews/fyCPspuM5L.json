Some conclusions made in the paper seem wrong. For example,  authors demonstrate that \u201cWhile the classification models showed consistent performance across various power grids, the regression models demonstrate lower MSE values for larger power grids. This observation can be attributed to the fact that larger power grids offer a greater diversity of scenarios, thus making it increasingly more difficult for a GNN model to identify and learn cascading failure patterns.\u201d It seems that authors want to say larger power grids are more difficult to predict. However, a lower MSE(\u201cthe regression models demonstrate lower MSE values for larger power grids.\u201d) indicates a better performance which means larger power grids are in fact easier to predict, which totally contradicts the author's statement."

GNNs have the potential to capture complex power grid phenomena and improve the accuracy of graph-level tasks such as identifying critical lines and predicting cascading failures. The lack of publicly available datasets for GNN applications in power grids has hindered progress in this area. PowerGraph aims to fill this gap by providing a large-scale, realistic dataset that can be used to train and evaluate GNN models for various tasks. The authors simulate a large number of cascading failure events on a synthetic power grid model. The resulting dataset contains over 10,000 graphs and can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Several baseline models are implemented for comparison and demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNs on PowerGraph. The dataset can also be used to benchmark GNN explainability methods as ground-truth edge-level explanations are also provided. Overall, the paper provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in applying GNNs to power grid analysis and highlights the potential of these models for improving the reliability and resilience of electrical power systems."
