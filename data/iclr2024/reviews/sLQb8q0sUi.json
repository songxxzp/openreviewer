The paper proposes VerFedSV which consider clients\u2019 contributions at multiple time stamps during training. VerFedSV satisfy desirable properties of fairness, can be efficiently computed without model training and extra communication cost.\nFor the synchronous setting, computing VerFedSV will require the embedding of all data points. However, only the embedding for a mini-batch is available. The paper proposed how to obtain the embedding matrix through low rank matrix completion and show that error in the estimated VerFedSV is bounded.\nFor the asynchronous setting, VerFedSV can be directly and exactly computed for the mini batch. VerFedSV will reward clients with more computational resources (batch size) and frequent communication."

Fan et al. (2022) have used low rank matrix completion to estimate utilities of subsets. In the introduction, it is mentioned that it is more challenging to compute Shapley value to VFL than HFL as it is not applicable (possible) to obtain the global model by concatenating private local models. The challenge has to be further clarified. Is the challenge resolved by using local embedding (as in other VFL work)?"
