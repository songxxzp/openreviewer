In Algorithm 1, how does the ReverseRandomResizedCrop function operate? Does it directly restore and scale a crop, or is it applied as a patch to the original image? Additionally, aside from preserving the same resolution, does it serve any other purpose in the overall process?\n5. The settings for reverse curriculum learning are not entirely clear. Could you please specify the actual values of \\beta_l and \\beta_u that are used during training?\n6. The experiments conducted in the study is not sufficient: (a) It would be valuable to include cross-architecture performance evaluations. Instead of exclusively training on the ResNet family (e.g. Table 6 and 7), consider testing the approach with a broader range of models such as LeNet, VGG, MLP, etc. (b) Expanding the evaluation datasets beyond ImageNet to include other datasets like SVHN, MNIST, etc., would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's performance. (c) More baselines should be compared, such as Gradient Matching, Differentiable Siamese Augmentation, Distribution Matching, KIP, and Training Trajectory Matching (d) Considering a wider range of IPC settings, especially with smaller IPC values like 1, 10, 20, would offer insights into the method's performance across various scenarios.\n7. It would be better to include a time and efficiency comparison when training on massive datasets like Image-21k.
