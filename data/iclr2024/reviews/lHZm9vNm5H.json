This paper is more like introducing a useful technical trick to reduce the overhead of ConvBN's eval mode in transfer learning. There are no foreseeable follow-up research directions here. This method technically belongs to Gradient Checkpointing (Bulo et al. (2018)), but the authors cleverly use the affine transformation of BN to escape the time cost. On the other hand, this trick can only apply to BN with eval mode."

Therefore, the authors should provide more experiments than the two selected models to verify this strong conclusion.\n2. As SyncBN's eval mode has similar behavior to BN, I am not sure whether the Tune mode can be directly applied to the backbone trained with SyncBN. The author can explain this in the response."

Thus, a new mode called Tune mode is proposed, which boasts the advantages of training stability and low computational time and space costs. \n\nTo verify the effectiveness of Tune mode, the authors selected 5 datasets and 12 models, and conducted extensive experiments in classification and detection tasks. The experiments show that using Tune mode for transfer learning results in a slight improvement in model performance, and a significant reduction in time and space costs. Furthermore, the authors tested the effectiveness of Tune mode in the generation of adversarial samples, thereby demonstrating the general applicability of Tune mode as a replacement for Eval mode in tasks that originally used Eval mode."
