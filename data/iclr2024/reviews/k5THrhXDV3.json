                "value": "This paper introduces a novel multimodal Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model that combines weakly-supervised learning and clustering for multiple heterogeneous modalities. The key contributions of the paper are as follows:\n\n**Multimodal VAE Model:** The paper presents a new multimodal VAE model that extends the latent space to simultaneously learn data clusters while leveraging shared information across different data modalities.\n\n**Improved Generative Performance:** Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing multimodal VAEs in terms of generative performance, particularly for unconditional generation tasks.\n\n**Automatic Cluster Selection:** The paper introduces a post-hoc procedure to automatically determine the number of true clusters, addressing critical limitations of previous clustering frameworks. This enhances the model's ability to discover meaningful clusters in weakly-supervised settings.\n\n**Comparison to Alternative Clustering Approaches:** The proposed method is compared favorably to alternative clustering approaches in weakly-supervised settings, highlighting its effectiveness in clustering and learning representations from multimodal data.\n\nIntegration of Diffusion Models: The paper incorporates recent advancements in diffusion models into the proposed method to further enhance generative quality, particularly for real-world images. This integration helps improve the realism of generated images."

The first is the application of weakly-supervised clustering, and the second is to combine multi-modal VAEs with DDPM to improve its generative quality. However, both applications of VAEs are not novel and can be viewed as an extension from VAEs to multi-modal VAEs. Though some new tricks are proposed in the form of multi-modal VAEs like Eq.8, it is not properly discussed and evaluated with sufficient ablation studies. \n\n2. The experiments are only conducted on one realistic multi-modal dataset that only contains two modalities. The authors mention the state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods are not scalable to numerous modalities while the proposed method is. The prior work is either on image-text [1] datasets or video-audio [2] [3] datasets. In Table 2, on PolyMNIST the proposed method is not improved over non-VAE SOTA either.\nTherefore, I think the authors overclaim the contribution of the scalability of numerous modalities. Especially for weakly-supervised clustering, in my opinion, a realistic multi-modal dataset is essential to claim the contribution of scalability to more modalities.\n\n\n[1] Zhou et al., End-to-End Adversarial-Attention Network for Multi-Modal Clustering.\n\n[2] Chen et al., Multimodal Clustering Networks for Self-supervised Learning from Unlabeled Videos.\n\n[3] Alwassel et al., Self-Supervised Learning by Cross-Modal Audio-Video Clustering."

It is important for the authors to focus on to further justify the contribution of extension VAEs to multi-modal VAEs in these tasks are not trivial and require careful design. I suggest the authors conduct ablation studies of such designs e.g. Eq.8.\n\n2. To claim the scalability of the method, the authors may consider more experiments on realistic datasets with more than two modalities.\n\n### After rebuttal\nThanks for the response and addressing my concerns. I raised my score to borderline accept. I suggest the authors consider moving some content in the Appendix (e.g. Eq.8 ablation study) to the main manuscript."
