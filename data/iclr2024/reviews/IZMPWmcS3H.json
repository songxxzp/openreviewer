                "value": "This work proposes four techniques on the task of 2D diffusion-guided text-to-3D generation, to enhance the generation quality. In particular, the authors 1) propose score distillation in both the latent and image space of the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models; 2) introduce a timestep annealing strategy to achieve photo-realistic and highly-detailed generation; 3) present a regularization method on the variance of z-coordinates along NeRF rays to encourage crisper surfaces; 4) they also propose a kernel smoothing technique to address flickering issues in the optimized NeRFs. They conduct qualitatively ablation studies and the experimental results demonstrate the effectness of the proposed techniques."

Can you provide more results to show that yours is better? I provide following text prompts from DreamFusion: 1) an orangutan making a clay bowl on a throwing wheel; 2) a raccoon astronaut holding his helmet; 3) a blue jay standing on a large basket of rainbow macarons; 4) a corgi taking a selfi; 5) a table with dim sum on it; 6) a lion reading the newspaper; 7) a tiger dressed as a doctor; 8) a chimpanzee dressed like Henry VIII king of England; 9) an all-utility vehicle driving across a stream; 10) a squirrel gesturing in front of an easel showing colorful pie charts. Can you do the comparisons with those prompts?\n\n* For the kernel smoothing, you only choose [1, 1, 1] as the sliding window kernel, have you tried other choices?"
