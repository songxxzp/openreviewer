                "value": "This paper introduces a differentiable optimization approach for solving the hierarchical clustering problem. Specifically, for the Dasgupta\u2019s objective and TSD objective. To this end, the authors begin by encoding the tree structure as two 0-1 matrices $\\hat{A}, \\hat{B}$. Then they relax the integer constraint and obtain two continuous matrices $A,B$, which can be interpreted as the probability distribution over the discrete tree structure. Consequently, the goal is transformed into optimizing the expectation over the distribution represented by $A$ and $B$. Moreover, the authors prove that the optimal value of the expectation is equivalent to the discrete version. \n\nIn the optimization procedure, the authors replace the expectation with its appriximation, the mean computed from sampled hierarchies. Due to the high complexity of computing Dasgupta\u2019s objectives, they employ subgraph sampling techniques to accelerate the evaluation process.\n\nFinally, the proposed method is extensively evaluated on diverse datasets to assess its performance and effectiveness."

For instance, considering $Das(\\tilde{T})$, $c(v_i\\wedge v_j)$ is the number of leaves under $LCA(v_i, v_j)$ and it should be computed as $\\sum_{z\\in Z}\\sum_{v\\in V}\\Pr(z=LCA(v_i,v_j)\\ and \\text{ v is under z})$ in the probabilistic tree. The two conditions in the formula are not independent hence eq. 13 is more accurate than eq. 9.\n- The new scaling method proposed by this work has better explainability than its counterpart in [1].\n- The experiment results demonstrate that EPH method is competitive in practical application.\n\n[1] End-to-End Learning of Probabilistic Hierarchies on Graphs"
