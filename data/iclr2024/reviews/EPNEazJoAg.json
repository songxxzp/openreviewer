Therefore, they recommend exploring feature interaction strengths within a model class consisting of approximately equally accurate predictive models. The authors suggest exploring feature interaction strengths within a model class comprising models that are approximately equally accurate. The authors introduce the concept of Feature Interaction Score (FIS) within the framework of a Rashomon set. To facilitate the calculation of the FIS within this model class, they present a practical algorithm to calculate FIS. FIS is a straightforward and heuristic method, but it is still novel to me."

In the example where the paper considers roots of a quadractic equation, it is unclear what \"the input variables a, b, and c exhibit different feature interactions in these two models\" means. Are the \"two models\" the two roots?  Further explanation is required, it is confusing what the readers are asked to infer.\n\n2. Consider adding a sentence to connect eq (6) to (2), currently it is a sentence fragment. \n\n3. \\mathcal{M} is not defined in (7) (its first use).\n\n4. How is eq (6) connected to (7)? It seems that the write-up connecting these two was skipped.\n\n5. Is there a reason to define and call the function in (5) as g(.)? Since the write-up so far uses f(.) for the predictive fuction, can the paper use f(.) instead of g(.)? The rationale is that in (8) the authors define the Rashomon set using g, while (1) uses f. Further, this change means that \\mathcal{M} can be defined in (1), and can improve the flow of the paper.\n\n6. What does the paper mean by \"then inversely calculate any order of interaction by decomposing...\" at the end of 3.2.1.\n\n7. Notation \\mathbbm{1}{i=1}^{p} will be more appropriate than $(1)_{i=1}^{p}$ in Algorithm 1. But more importantly, it is unclear how m+ is different from m-. They seem like a vector of size p of ones, i.e. both are the same. If so, then what is the difference between m_i+ and m_i-?\n\n8. Algorithm 1 is somewhat difficult to follow. Since this is the key contribution, can the authors explain the role of various terms such as \"learning rate\", \\phi_s etc. are?\nEditing the algorithm to have comments, or updating 3.2.2 to reflect the terms in Alg. 1, can help. For instance, I am still unclear how the computations are taking place over multiple models, and if this is being influenced by \"learning rate\" somehow. \n\n9. Can the authors explain what they mean by \"In theory, the joint effects of features should not exceed the boundary when there is no feature interaction.\"? Mathematical formulation can help. \n\n10. Which functions is depicted in Fig. 3? We see x_0, x_1, and x_2, but it is unclear what was the original functional form.\n\n11. What does \"*\" refer to in computational time section?\n\n12. Fig. 4 would benefit from axis labels, and needs to be referred to in the write-up.\n\n13. Halo plots -- the blue curves for a fixed \\epsilon account for all \\phi_{i,j} (in the 2D case), but what is the x and y axis supposed to denote? Do the negative and positive values on the y axis carry meaning? Why does the x axis not have any axis values?\n\n14. The term \"MCR\" is undefined."
