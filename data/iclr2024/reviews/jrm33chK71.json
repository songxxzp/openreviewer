The paper presents approaches for three different \u2018levels\u2019 of available target information, validated by experiments on several datasets and a variety of different heuristics for the case of least available information (aka uninformed setting). The authors demonstrate that a careful selection can indeed improve results across most benchmarks, but equally point out and discuss potential challenges when domain gaps are relatively big."

(i.e. the presented approach) \u2013 some comments/insights regarding this would be helpful; \n\n- Along the same lines: Given this motivation, wouldn\u2019t then a reasonable baseline to compare to be the network \u2018just\u2019 trained on the subset of classes from scratch? In other words, how important is the pre-training on all the base classes? (as stated, it might even be harmful?)\n\n**Slightly limited scope**:\n- The presented results are somewhat constrained to the authors\u2019 own setup \u2013 i.e. one baseline architecture that is used and then improved; However, the authors do not provide any indication as to what \u2018sota\u2019 methods that use the same backbone currently achieve on the chosen datasets;   \n&rarr;  *Note*: I do in no way expect the authors to \u2018beat\u2019 any sota method as this paper is mainly about providing insights, but it would be interesting for the reader to know how far the \u2018plain\u2019 baseline and the \u2018improved\u2019 one are from top-performing methods; Some insight whether this sub-class finetuning setup might help in other methods as well (e.g. during meta-finetuning) would also be helpful to further support the paper\u2019s findings.\n\n**Missing ablation**:\n- The authors note that they choose the top 50 classes (AA) in the informed settings to create the subsets, mainly to keep \u2018similar size of subsets\u2019 to the uninformed settings;   \n&rarr; How important is this selection to achieve \u2018good\u2019 results? (robustness) \u2013 Some ablation would be helpful here;  \n&rarr; It feels like this might be highly dependent on the composition of the dataset (base classes)?  \n&rarr; I suspect there might be a more \u2018generalizable\u2019, dynamic and potentially better justifiable way to select the classes than a mere \u201ctop x\u201d constant, e.g. certain % of the total mass / classes that cumulatively achieve certain threshold in the softmax; or even just a threshold on the \u2018minimal contribution within the softmax\u2019."

Additionally, what impact might this have on the representational capacity of the fine-tuned feature extractor, especially when considering domains with a significantly higher or lower intrinsic class cardinality?\n\n- How do the proposed heuristics for selecting specialist feature extractors address the issue of distributional shifts between the labeled support set and the unseen query set in few-shot learning tasks? Considering that these heuristics (SSA, SSC, LOO, SNR, RKM, MCS, FIM, AA) rely on the assumption that the support set is a representative sample of the task's data distribution, isn't there a significant risk that the heuristics will fail to predict feature extractor performance accurately in the presence of such shifts? \n\n- How can the method be robustified to account for potential discrepancies between the support and query distributions, which are common in real-world scenarios?"

They propose a novel pipeline that fine-tunes a pre-trained model on a subset of training examples (\"base classes\"), which are similar to the testing domain, to emphasize these parts and benefit the testing performance. They investigate three settings of tasks, including informed and un-informed, and design specific methods for them. The experiment results show that the proposed pipeline significantly improves the results."

This makes the audience unable to see a rigid, complete version of their method from a main paper, raising concern about page limit circumvention.\n- In Sec. 3.2 about informed settings, a method is directly put there without any analysis, reasons, and details. I would like the authors to provide the motivation and some details behind these methods: Why is AA designed in this form? What is the implementation of $g$, fine-tuning on a pre-trained, fixed $h$; using a non-learning method on $g$; or co-train $h$ and $g$ on the pre-trained dataset? Is the same $g$ used in the latter testing phase? Does the scale of $g$ (as logits) matter in selecting $\\mathcal{X}$?\n- In Sec. 3.3 about uninformed settings, the authors introduce the method just by listing and citing a number of related works. So, I would like to know what the authors contribute to this part, or whether they are just summarizing or aggregating existing methods.\n- All the tasks are image classifications. I wonder if other tasks, other than image classification, can be applied with the proposed pipeline. I would like to see some simple yet representative results on any other tasks. If the proposed method can be applied not only in image classification but also in many other tasks, the contribution of this paper can be even higher.\n- (Minor) In Alg. 1, the set of examples is defined as $\\mathcal{X}$, but the pseudo code uses $X$. And, line 2 is actually not required since operation 3 \"selecting top $M$\" already requires a top-$M$ partition."
