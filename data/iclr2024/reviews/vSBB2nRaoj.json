They introduce hindsight re-labeling for the forward tasks and a concept called `Foresight` for reverse tasks. To learn reverse moves from the reverse paths, agents are initiated from these paths to gather forward moves. All these components are glued together in a framework named `Scrambler-Resolver-Explorer (SRE)`. \nExperiments are ran on toy problems with discrete state and action : `NChain` and a `Simple Gridworld`."

And this idea has similarity to [1] where a forward and backward representation of the reward is being learned.\n- It is also a nice concept to try to have a distinction between an explorer, scrambler and resolver module where the primary focus of exploration of each module is distinct.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Learning One Representation to Optimize All Rewards - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07945.pdf"

The tasks `NChain` and `Simple GridWorld` are too simple and despite that the results seem very unstable.\n- All the results are single-seeded and there is no measure of variance among multiple runs. I recommend the authors to present multi-seeded results over at least `10` random seeds per run to ensure reproducibility.\n- `Figure 3` : All methods including the `HER` and `RE` baselines seem to work on-par and `SRE_NITR` diverges on the 10Chain. And on 15Chain all methods perform the same.\n- `Figure 4` : Mixed and unstable results. The proposed method `SRE_NC` seems to have divergence issues.\n- There has been more work for exploration in RL, looking at expanding trees and search - for example [1] which can potentially be a baseline.\n- The framework still operates under a simple discrete states and action setting building on `DQN`. The authors claim that nothing is preventing \nthe framework to being extended to a continuous setting. However given the performance on the simpler setting, I'm not convinced it can readily be extended.\n- HER has been tried on many grid world navigation tasks. I recommend to the authors to redo a literature survey on this to pull more related work.\n- The writing and flow of the related work can be improved significantly. For instance, there is a related work section on `Surrogate Objective for Goal-conditioned RL` going through equations for the Lipschitz continuity assumption and Wassersetein distance and its not even relevant to their framework. Overall this makes reading the paper more difficult because I don't need to see the equations for related work.\n\n[1] Probabilistic Planning with Sequential Monte Carlo methods - ICLR 2019 - https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByetGn0cYX"

I understand it is difficult to provide any theoretical guarantees for relabeling methods, and perhaps this is out of scope of the paper. But, see the next point.\n4) All experiments are performed on extremely simple toy MDPs where judging the benefits of a complex goal sampling technique can be difficult. Moreover, the proposed method SRE-DQN doesn't perform the best in any of the tasks. \n5) It is surprising that the success rate on such simple MDPs is lower than 20%. For example in a 3x3 MDP, both the SRE-DQN and HER get around 0 success rate. I suspect that an error in the implementation is causing this. \n5) Implementation details as well as the code have not been provided."
