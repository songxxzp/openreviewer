It points out that the class descriptions generated by existing methods may not provide useful information that differentiates the class from other classes. \n\nTo address this problem, this paper proposes the Follow-up Differential Descriptions (FuDD). FuDD first identifies a set of ambiguous classes using the basic class descriptions. Then, for each ambiguous class, a LLM is prompted to generate descriptions, which involve information that can distinguish it from other ambiguous classes. The generated class descriptions are then used to obtain the final classification results.\n\nThe empirical studies show that FuDD outperforms the basic class descriptions and na\u00efve LLM generated descriptions that do not consider differential attributes between classes. The experiments include two kinds of LLMs, i.e., the GPT-3.5 (accessed via API) and the open-sourced LLAMa2. It is shown that LLAMa2-based FuDD can achieve effective results after being fine-tuned on the descriptions generated by GPT-3.5."

The effectiveness of such models hinges critically on and is bounded by the vision-language models. I suspect that this could be why the performance improvement is not very significant and why different CLIP variants could exhibit huge performance variations.\n\nI would appreciate an error analysis: how many of the mistakes are due to insufficient / erroneous differential descriptions and how many of the mistakes are due to CLIP\u2019s insensitivity to descriptions?

For k=10, does it mean we need to create 55 queries? For experiments where k = |C|, will the cost become prohibitive (even with caching)?\n\nIt would be better if such details are discussed in the main text."
