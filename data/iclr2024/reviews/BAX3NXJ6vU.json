To give one such example (among several), Assumption 2 is not quite precise: There should be a quantifier on \\xi, \\zeta (e.g. I suppose this should hold for almost every \\xi and \\zeta).\n\n- The authors never define HV and JV as stated in Theorem 2.  I assume these are the number of required Hessian and Jacobian vector products.\n\n- The description of the algorithm is fairly difficult to follow.  I would recommend moving the second empirical result on hyper-representation learning to the appendix and perhaps using the extra space to more clearly explain the algorithm."

                "value": "1. This question is a bit broader than the scope of the paper, but answering it would help quite a bit in terms of clarity.  The authors mention a lower bound of Zhang et. al (2021) which is achieved for deterministic algorithms by Lin, et. al (2020b).  Could the authors clarify the situation on the lower bound in the specific setting they consider? E.g. with the smoothness assumptions imposed by Assumptions 2, 3 and strong convexity Assumption 1, are there known results for lower bounds on reaching a second order stationary point as considered here? It is interesting to improve upper bounds as done in this paper, but some guidance on lower bounds would either (i.) situate and clarify the results quite a bit if known or (ii.) strengthen the results significantly if not known. \n\n2. Regarding the numerical experiments, the trajectory of the proposed algorithm exhibits some interesting behavior which would be nice to clarify.  In particular, should the reader interpret the flat regions (e.g. Figure 1.(a) iterations 10^{4} \u2013 2\\cdot 10^{4}) as while the algorithm is trying to escape from a bad critical point? Moreover, there seem to be distinctions in the convergence behavior in the different phases.  It is a bit hard to tell, but the proposed method seems to enjoy linear convergence to the first critical point and thereafter sublinear convergence behavior (with different rates of convergence, for instance at iterate 4*10^{4} in Figure 1.(a)).  Could the authors clarify this a bit?"

In minimization problems, this is natural. However, in games, we care about equilibria. For instance, [1] discussed the significance of the local minimax point in this area, while [2] mentioned that a second-order stationary condition implies a local minimax point (Fact 1). Nevertheless, the relationship between saddle points of the primal function and the local minimax point remains somewhat unclear to me. Do they not intersect at all? Why should we escape these saddle points? What happens in bilevel optimization?\n\n* Although the work proposes the first first-order stochastic algorithm for NS-SC minimax optimization with second-order convergence and improves the complexity for bilevel problems, the techniques seem similar to existing methods, namely, LENA [3] and SREDA. Could the author elucidate the novelty in the algorithm design or proof techniques?\n\n* Regarding the experiments, how did the author choose the hyper-parameters? Were these hyper-parameters optimized for each algorithm? While the sensitivity of StocBio + iNEON to hyper-parameters is discussed, I am curious about the fairness of the comparison.\n\n* Some claims appear unsound:\n    - Theorems 1 and 2 should also include assumptions regarding noise. This is only mentioned in the appendix during the proof of these theorems. Additionally, the noise assumption (Equation 13) is not \"bounded variance\" but should be termed as bounded noise or bounded noise support, which is stronger than bounded variance.\n    - \"PRGDA is the first algorithm that is guaranteed to obtain second-order stationary point for stochastic nonconvex minimax optimization problems.\" However, newer versions of the cited paper (Chen et al. (2021b)) introduce a stochastic version. This should also be reflected in Table 1; for instance, Cubic-GDA should be marked in the \"Stochastic\" field.\n    - Some references appear to be inaccurate, for example, \"including intuitive methods SGDmax (Jin et al. (2019))\", and \"SGDmax (Jin et al. (2019)) is an intuitive double loop algorithm\".\n\n* Some notations either are not introduced or are only formally defined in later sections, such as:\n    - \"$Gc$\" in the abstract.\n    - \"$\\Phi$\" is introduced early on but is only defined in section 3.\n    - \"SFO\" is not defined. I assume it stands for \"stochastic first-order oracle\".\n    - \"$JV$\" and \"$HV$\" in Theorem 2 are not defined.\n\n# References\n\n[1] Jin, Chi, Praneeth Netrapalli, and Michael Jordan. \"What is local optimality in nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization?.\" International conference on machine learning.

Specifically, in sections 4 and 5 where algorithm 1 is introduced, the description is very dense and difficult to parse. The authors refer to quite a few previous algorithms such as SREDA, PiSARAH and SPIDER without actually giving a brief summary of what these algorithms do. Also missing from this section is a highlight of what makes PRGDA different from the previous SOTA method in Huang et al. 2022. \n- Another major weak point in the presentation is a lack of clearer comparison with prior work. In tables 2 and 3, it is unclear to me if most of these results are actually comparable, since I'm not sure if they use all the assumptions 1-5 in this paper. In addition, the related work is scattered throughout the whole paper, and many prior algorithms are named, but not described at all. Obviously the authors do not need to describe all prior work in detail, but I think it is important to highlight what makes PRGDA from prior algorithms except from stochasticity and a simple perturbation. \n- Section 6 is called convergence analysis, so i expected this section to include a discussion of the theoretical innovations of PRGDA that allows the authors to prove a better gradient complexity. However, there is no convergence analysis at all. Instead, only the two main theorems are stated, without any further explanation. This makes it hard to gauge how significant the theoretical guarantees are. For instance, in section 2.3 the authors claim that perturbed GD in the deterministic and stochastic settings are totally different. However, this is not the case at least in Jin et al. [1], where the proof for GD and SGD are quite similar. The analysis for GD and SGD might be more different in bilevel and minimax optimization, but I think it needs to be spelled out in more detail. \n\nOverall I think the actual contributions of this paper are a bit hard to see because of the presentation. I suggest the authors spend more space to clarify difference with prior work and spell out the innovations in both your algorithm and proof technique.\n\n[1] Jin, Chi, et al. \"On nonconvex optimization for machine learning: Gradients, stochasticity, and saddle points.\" Journal of the ACM (JACM) 68.2 (2021): 1-29."
