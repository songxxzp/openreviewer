                "value": "This paper introduces a novel approach to curriculum learning in deep neural networks. Curriculum learning is a technique where the learning process is guided by the order in which training samples are presented, typically starting with easier examples and progressively moving to more difficult ones. Traditional curriculum learning methods require sorting data by difficulty, which can be cumbersome. In contrast, LeRaC proposes a data-free curriculum learning strategy that dynamically adjusts the learning rates for different layers of a neural network during initial training epochs. Specifically, it assigns higher learning rates to layers closer to the input, gradually reducing them as layers move away from the input. The learning rates converge to a uniform value, and the model is then trained as usual. This approach is tested across various domains (computer vision, language, and audio) and architectures, outperforming traditional training and a state-of-the-art data-free curriculum learning approach called Curriculum by Smoothing."

                "value": "- In Figure 2, the authors present a straightforward example illustrating the relationship between shallow and deep features. This example is intuitive and easy to grasp; however, there are some points open for discussion. For instance, the statement \"as the information in $x$ is lost\" might not necessarily hold when utilizing random convolutional kernels or random transformations, as seen in the popular diffusion model's noise injection process. Therefore, I suggest rephrasing this part.\n\n- Regarding the example mentioned earlier, I believe the network's representation should be considered holistically. Is it meaningful to discuss the representations of individual layers separately? Will merely increasing the learning rate for shallow layer parameters lead to faster convergence of shallow network parameters? The first theorem seems insufficient to address this issue.\n\n- In Equation (9), the author mentions, \"we empirically observed that an exponential scheduler is better.\" It would be beneficial for the author to provide an insightful explanation as to why the exponential scheduler is superior to linear or logarithmic schedulers. Are there any other potentially better scheduling methods, such as cosine learning rate variations?\n\n- The author should provide clarification on the aforementioned points. Once these issues are addressed, I will assess these clarifications in conjunction with feedback from other reviewers to determine whether I should reconsider my evaluation."
