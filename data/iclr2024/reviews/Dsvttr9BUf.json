These seem very arbitrary. Would it not have been more informative to have used the same base pre-trained model weights for all fine-tuning experiments instead of training to different numbers?\n\n\nThis method seems to suggest that one would like to deploy a backbone model for a variety of tasks and SPLoRA will allow you to accelerate that model as well as adapt the tasks while preserving the size on disk.
