                "value": "This paper studies the problem of estimating, given samples from a discrete distributions, the collision probability of the distribution to within an *additive* (constant) factor. The collision probability is the probability that a pair of samples from the distribution collides (equals the same value), and is essentially equivalent to the well-studied second moment of the distribution. For a distribution with support size\u00a0\n$k$\u00a0and probabilities\u00a0$p_1, \\ldots, p_k$, the collision probability is\u00a0$\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i^2$. The goal is to estimate this quantity to within an\u00a0additive\u00a0error of\u00a0$\\pm \\epsilon$. \n\nAs mentioned, estimating the second moment of a distribution is a classical problem in statistics and data analysis. However, most of the literature (for example, all of the streaming literature) focuses on\u00a0multiplicative\u00a0\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation of these quantities, rather than additive approximation. In many interesting cases, an\u00a0$\\epsilon$-additive approximation is much more crude (and consequently, much easier to compute) than a\u00a0\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-multiplicative one. Indeed, it is not hard to see for example that the collision probability is smaller than\u00a0\n$\\max \\{p_1, \\ldots, p_k\\}$, so for any distribution that doesn't have an heavy hitter with probability more than\u00a0$\\epsilon$, returning the value $0$ or $\\epsilon$ would trivially satisfy the approximation requirements.\n\nThe main two contributions of the authors are as follows:\n1. A differentially private estimator for the collision probability in the local DP model. The sample complexity for local\u00a0$(\\alpha, \\beta)$-DP estimation to within additive error\u00a0$\\epsilon$ is $O(\\log (1/\\beta) / \\alpha^2 \\epsilon^2)$, an improvement by a factor of $1/\\epsilon^2$\u00a0over previous work [Bravo-Hermsdorff et al., NeurIPS 2022]. Notably the results in Bravo-Hermsdorff et al. are in the pure DP local model, whereas here the results are in the approximate setting.\n2. An estimator, not differentially private, for the sequential setting where we do not know\u00a0$\\epsilon$\u00a0in advance and need to test whether the collision probability is equal to some value\u00a0$c_0$ (null hypotheses) or\u00a0$\\epsilon$-far from it in additive terms. The sample complexity, for constant success probability, is\u00a0$O(\\log \\log (1 / \\epsilon) / \\epsilon^2)$, and it is standard and easy to see that this is optimal up to the lower order term."

                "value": "This work considers the problem of estimating or testing collision probabilities given samples from an unknown distribution in two interesting settings: local privacy and sequential testing. For the former problem, the goal is to develop a sample- and communication-efficient mechanism that achieves $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-privacy in the usual DP sense, with the local constraint ensuring that privacy is maintained even with an untrusted server. When $\\alpha,\\beta>0$, this work extends prior work of Bravo-Hesdorff, et al. [Neurips'22] by providing a distributed hashing-based approach that achieves sample complexity $O(\\log(1/\\beta)/\\alpha^2\\varepsilon^2)$ to attain $\\varepsilon$ additive accuracy with constant probability. This is complemented with a lower bound for the case $\\beta=0$, where it is shown that the denominator is necessary. The sequential testing problem is as follows: given a value $c_0\\in [0,1]$ and error probability $\\delta$, query samples from the distribution and either (i) never reject with probability at least $1-\\delta$ if the true collision probability is $c_0$, or (ii) if the true collision probability is at least $\\varepsilon$-far from $c_0$, reject after $N(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$ samples with probability $1-\\delta$ with minimal $N(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$. In this case, this work shows that $N(\\varepsilon,\\delta)\\leq O(\\log(\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/\\delta)/\\varepsilon^2)$ is sufficient, while $\\Omega(\\log(1/\\delta)/\\varepsilon^2)$ is necessary. The upper bound is attained by leveraging powerful martingale inequalities to analyze the deviations of an appropriate estimator."

                "value": "Recommendation: While the paper is nicely written, my current understanding is that the technical achievements of this paper are somewhat overstated or unclear at present. As a result, my current inclination is weak reject; however, I could very well be convinced by the authors or other reviewers that my understanding is flawed, and I would be more than happy to revise my score in this case.\n\nMajor Comments/Questions\n\n---It may also be worth giving more motivation for why sequential testing (i.e. where the cutoff parameter $\\varepsilon$ is not given as an input) is a relevant goal compared to more standard objectives in property testing.\n\n---What specific properties of the hash family do you need? The reason I ask is that communicating a random hash function requires a large number of bits; however, this can be reduced drastically if one can settle for $\\ell$-wise independence in the analysis using standard techniques from the pseudorandomness literature (see, e.g. Vadhan's monograph).\n \n---As best I can tell, the lower bound in Theorem 3 is not really comparable to the upper bound in Theorem 2 since one imposes $\\beta = 0$ in the former while the upper bound requires $\\beta>0$. For instance, when $\\beta>0$, it does not seem to be necessary to have any dependence on $\\alpha$, since it seems to me that simple approach is to have each agent to uniformly randomize their sample with probability $(1-\\beta)$ and then debiasing the resulting collision probability. This would require $\\mathsf{poly}(1/\\beta)$ samples, so it may also be worth explaining which parameter dependencies are better in practice.\n\n---Unless I'm missing something, the claim that the guarantee of Theorem 2 improves upon the prior result of Bravo-Hemsdorff et al. might be a bit misleading since their result holds for $\\beta=0$ whereas Theorem 2 does not. While I'm not an expert, one expects that enforcing $\\beta=0$ leads to different or incomparable technical challenges. However, the lower bound in Theorem 3 gives some evidence that the Bravo-Hemsdorff et al. result may be improved.\n\n---I might be missing some subtlety, but can one obtain the sequential testing guarantees using the existing results of Daskalakis and Kawase [ESA'17]? Namely, given a stream of samples $X_1,X_2,\\ldots\\in [k]$ from some fixed distribution, consider $Z_1,\\ldots\\in \\{0,1\\}$ with $Z_t = \\mathbf{1}[X_{2t-1}=X_{2t}]$. Then the $Z_t$ are independent coin flips with bias $p$ where $p$ is the collision probability of the distribution. The two cases are then that $p=c_0$ or $\\vert p-c_0\\vert=\\varepsilon>0$. My understanding is that Daskalakis and Kawase [Theorem 2, ESA'17] have shown that a natural sequential testing rule that, given a candidate $c_0$ and the stream $Z_1,Z_2,\\ldots$, proceeds by testing whether this bias is close or far to $c_0$ with dyadically decreasing thresholds will properly reject after $\\Theta(\\log(\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/\\delta)/\\varepsilon^2)$ samples of the $Z$ with probability at least $1-\\delta$ or never reject with probability at least $1-\\delta$ in the good case.\n\n---Relatedly, Theorem 6 is nontrivial compared to the problem of testing (sequentially or not) the bias of a coin from independent samples since one gets strictly more information in this case. One suspects that the extra $\\log\\log$ term is inherent, but this does not appear to follow from the lower bounds of Daskalakis and Kawase since one gets more information  in this setting (namely, the actual values in $[k]$). Closing this gap would be quite interesting.\n\nMinor Comments\n\n---It may be worth a footnote to explain the difference between ``local'' DP and DP for the non-expert.\n\n---I did not get a chance to check the proofs in the Supplementary Material too carefully, but the proof sketches seemed reasonable.\n\n---While my own interest is more on the theory side, the empirical results in Section 6 appear quite interesting.\n\n---For what it's worth, there is probably a simpler proof of Theorem 7 in the Appendix; since the collision probability is the probability of the event two independent samples are equal, the difference in collision probabilities is at most the total variation between the product distributions $X^{\\otimes 2}$ and $Y^{\\otimes 2}$. But this is at most twice the total variation between $X$ and $Y$ by a hybrid argument."

CP estimation is well motivated and has applications to a number of areas in statistics. This work considers the problem in the distributed privacy setting where there are a number of users that have a single sample drawn from a distribution. The aim is to design a mechanism that lets the users communicate their information to a central server, such that the server can determine the CP without learning too much about the sample held by any particular user.  \n\nThe solution presented in the paper improves upon the state of the art in terms of the minimum number of samples required to ensure the privacy guarantees are met. The proposal is nearly optimal in the sample complexity, as shown by lower bound is also provided in the paper.  The authors implement their algorithm and test it on a dataset, to find that the algorithm performs better in practice as well. \n\nThe authors also consider the problem of sequential testing in the standard non-private setting, where one has sample access. Here the task is to test whether the CP is some value c_0 or if it additively epsilon far from c_0. The sequential testing problem also requires that the test be adaptive in terms of epsilon, when the epsilon is unknown. Here they provide an algorithm nearly optimal in epsilon."
