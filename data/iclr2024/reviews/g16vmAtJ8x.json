            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I do have some concerns, however.\n\nWhile the numerical results that authors demonstrate are very impressive, their choice of datasets is rather limited: in many cases, this is just a limitation/future work area, however, in this work, i argue this is a major flaw. These datasets were commonly known as the relatively \u2018trivial\u2019 ML tasks, mainly because of how simple they are. Therefore, reconstructing this data (as shown in works such as [1,2,3,4]) is A) relatively straightforward even with simple inversion attacks and B) is very often due to a very limited reconstruction space that the adversary is present with (i.e. there are many ways to define a valid number in MNIST, for instance). So while these results demonstrate that the metrics are indeed poorly performing on these specific datasets, I am not convinced this is the case for more complex settings, where the reconstruction space is much larger (e.g. even in CIFAR10). Therefore, I would like to see similar results being presented on non-trivial tasks to show that the proposed flaws do affect more realistic settings too. \n\nOne fundamental concern of mine related to this is that this attack may require human supervision: from section 5, it reads that even for cases as simple as MNIST, the adversary needs to \u2018strategically\u2019 perform some sort of reconstruction guidance (e.g. excluding certain pixels). I would argue that this, in part, violates your threat model and really harms the applicability of your method to real-world imaging tasks. Because in order to know which pixels need removal, the attacker needs to have some sort of prior on the images: sure it is trivial with handwritten digits what pixels to remove, but what about skin pathology imaging? The images are much more identifiable if one knows attributes associated with individuals in the dataset, but also require much more expertise to know how to interpret them and what to keep/remove. \n\nAdditionally, while the authors claim that the models they attack are SotA, I am not fully certain that this is indeed the case. It was previously shown that models such as DPGAN, for instance, are not particularly great at generating meaningful datasets when there are outliers which need to be represented (which is, again, poorly captured in datasets such as MNIST).\n\nSome of the issues with the SBPM metrics are valid, but rather inflated. In particular, I agree that issue 4 correctly identifies the issues when adversarial samples are present - but this is also an assumption applicable to almost all ML settings too? Same for issue 5: while I agree that it is often easy to misinterpret what SPBM mean numerically, the same can be said about DP (which given issue 1 is \u2018supposed to be\u2019 an alternative to SPBMs as it gives you objective guarantees), which has a privacy parameter often poorly interpreted and contextualised. So yes, this is an issue, but it is not specific to SPBMs and I would go as far as arguing that it is not fully fair to associate these issues with every single SPBM method: in my view, IMS is extremely easy to interpret, and this is precisely why its problematic (i.e. its interpretation is easy, but the score itself is unrepresentative, causing its misuse).  \n\nMy concrete suggestion here would be to tone down some of the issues (and maybe consider if all of them are really relevant to these specific methods you present) and then use the space that you gained to include more information on how the attack works in the main body. I understand that the algorithm itself is in the appendix, but there is nothing in the main body at all that helps the reader understand how this attack actually functions. All we have is a threat model and assumptions. The reason I find this important is because you are able to leverage these privacy violations primarily because you were able to present a novel data reconstruction attack, which is the core contribution of this work, but you are really not presenting this main contribution at all (except for the appendix)."

                "value": "Could you also, perhaps, clarify how exactly was DP training performed? From my understanding, construction of privacy filters requires you to derive information from the private data: hence it is unclear to me how this was handled and accounted for in terms of the privacy budget? This might be related to the leakage comes from the privacy metrics; as they require access to the train data and are deterministic: does this mean that your empirical evaluation is done in this manner and hence uses unaccounted private information? If so, you are leaking information, thereby completely invalidating your DP. Could you clarify this in detail, as DP is a large section of your work and your conclusions strongly suggest that DP cannot mitigate your attack. Also: it seemed to me that all of your algorithms except for CT-GAN used DP already, why a separate section?\n\nAdditionally: I would like you to present the SearchAttack in more detail: it is unclear what \u2018history of records from the first pass\u2019 is. \n\nOverall, I am really on the fence about this work. The conclusions and empirical examples can be incredibly useful for the ML community as a whole, but the results themselves are not particularly representative and the DP section is very unclear (and can potentially be very misleading). I would like the authors to address the issues I outlined above, in which case I will be willing to increase my score.\n\n[1] - Geiping, Jonas, et al. \"Inverting gradients-how easy is it to break privacy in federated learning?.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 16937-16947.\n[2] - Zhu, Ligeng, Zhijian Liu, and Song Han. \"Deep leakage from gradients.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 32 (2019).\n[3] - Usynin, Dmitrii, et al. \"Zen and the art of model adaptation: Low-utility-cost attack mitigations in collaborative machine learning.\" Proc.

However, they evaluate privacy via heuristics that do not provide strong guarantees.  \n\nThe contribution show that IMS, DCR and NNDR are not good metrics for privacy. They do so by (i) exposing major flaws in the design with respect to standard privacy and security guidelines  (ii) illustrating contradictions in the privacy assessment of the metrics by the use of counter examples and (iii) providing a data reconstruction attack that is able to recover a substantial amount of dataset outliers by having black-box access to the synthetic data generators and the output of the privacy metrics."

                "value": "As said, early sections of the paper successfully identify important design flaws in the assessment of the privacy provided by synthetic data. However, the arguments provided by the main contribution, which is the ReconSyn the attack, are not sufficiently solid. \n\nThe main objective of the paper is to show that IMS, DCR and NNDR are inadequate as privacy metrics. This essentially means that these metrics fail to assess how much sensitive information is leaked by sharing a synthetic dataset. To do that, the contribution presents an attack that attempts to recover the original data points from the synthetic data generator. However, the attack proposed by the protocol (ReconSyn) seems to have a major flaw: it success does not rely on the sensitive information released by synthetic data, which is only used marginally. The attack heavily relies on the ability to query privacy metrics an arbitrary amount of times. These queries provide a *huge* amount of information: the distance to real data points (given by DCR and NNDR) and the amount of synthetic data points that match the real ones (given by IMS). It is not surprising that one could successfully reconstruct outlier data points with arbitrary access to that information. \n\nThe above is confirmed from the results of Section 5.2 which show that the attack performs well regardless of the quality of the synthetic data and even when data is generated with strong DP guarantees (see Section 5.2.3). \n\nMy impression over the main take-away of the paper is that revealing the privacy metrics is dangerous. Therefore, the impact of the contribution seems low: it does not provide a compelling argument against the release of synthetic data itself when its IMS, DCR and NNDR scores are not revealed (even if the synthetic data has been evaluated with these metrics). \n\nIn addition, I do not think that the evaluation of the attack against differentially private techniques of generation is well addressed. In the current setting, the attacker has the possibility to access information that is not differentially private (i.e the privacy metrics) and has unlimited queries to the privacy mechanism. It is well known that epsilon and delta DP parameters degrade after each query to the mechanism."

                "value": "## Paper Structure/ Understanding ReconSyn\nWithout reading the appendix, I had little to no idea about how the attack works. Then I read the appendix, and I found it still to be rather unclear (although I get the general idea). \n1) The attack needs to be described in the main paper. One suggestion to make room for this could be to cut the incredibly verbose evaluation section down to summarize the key points over all datasets with a few interesting anomalies. As the paper is currently written, we read the evaluation with little idea of what is being evaluated.\n2) The algorithm needs to be described more formally as to the exact set operation that takes place during filtering and the exact branching conditions based on the metrics.\n\n## How practical is the attack?\nWhile I was convinced that the similarity metrics are a bad idea without the attack, I think the attack is not as practical as it is portrayed. \n1) Assuming the adversary can query any dataset with the metric seems far-fetched. Although the paper argues this is the case in practice, it would be easy for companies to restrict this.\n2) In Section 5, it seemed the attack was adaptive (The search attack is deployed based on the performance of the Sample attack). However it was not clear how the attack could know the reconstruction rate of the previous component without access to the training data. \n3) It would be helpful to list the number of queries to the metric oracles/the effect that a rate-limiting defence would have on attack success.\n4) While the attack is useful for a proof of concept, it doesn't have any merit in the case that the privacy metrics are not leaked. Thus, the argument that it outperforms related work in terms of its lack of assumptions is a little misleading.\n\n## DP argument\nThe section about the effect of DP is somewhat a moot point as it can not be DP while allowing unperturbed queries about the training dataset (the metrics). I somewhat get the idea to show that even if they decided to use DP on the generator, it still wouldn't be enough with the metrics being present. Perhaps more interesting would be to show what happens if the metrics are released with DP (an actual defence). Although epsilon already gives an indicator of how private the synthetic data is, the best defence would be removing the metrics entirely.\n\n## Minor comments\n- Consider using parenthesis around citations, as some sentences are hard to parse when filled with citations that are not distinguished from normal text.\n- 2D gauss was missing from Table 1 despite section 5.1.1 referring to it.\n- No mention of how the ground truth outliers are computed in the evaluation.\n- Figure 5 is very hard to read. The shading is subtle and changes the colour to make it even more confusing. Perhaps shapes for eachepsilon and make them shaded or hollow for the two attacks?\n- $1/n$ is too large for a delta parameter. It technically allows a trivial mechanism that publishes a single record of the database. The general rule of thumb is that $\\delta << 1/n$ [Dwork & Roth](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/TCS-042)"

The authors provide a thorough review of these metrics and provide counter-examples where a metric would declare synthetic data to be safe even though it isn\u2019t. The authors then propose a threat model for attacking synthetic data as typically provided by a start-up, where the adversary has unlimited query access to the generative model and the ability to recompute the privacy metrics over arbitrary datasets. They develop a reconstruction attack and demonstrate on several datasets that the attack succeeds in reconstructing a large fraction of outliers in the datasets. Finally, they show that even when the generative model is DP, reconstruction still succeeds better than expected due to leakage in the privacy metrics."

This may lead to over-optimistic results.

In the Appendix, to ensure reproducibility, the authors should precisely describe steps 18-32 of Alg. 1. The current textual descriptions are too informal/imprecise.\n\nMinor (suggestions for improvement):\n\n- 4) Missing (conceptual and/or empirical) comparison to the reconstruction method of Dick et al. Can the authors describe (add a paragraph on) how their reconstruction method relates to Dick et al.? Even though the methods operate on different objects (aggregates in Dick et al. as compared to synthetic data here), they both involve repeated generation of datasets of \u201ccandidate\u201d records and filtering of these records in some way to only keep the most likely records. \n- 5) Unfinished sentence on page 3: The test passes if [...]-5th percentile is larger or equal.\u201d"
