It is made more concrete by theorem 2 and corrolary 1.\nThe experiments investigate the interplay between type order L (order of the Spherical Harmonics expansion, e.g. L=1 is vectors, L=0 scalars, L>1 are high order tensors), depth, and channel number, in the context of fixed feature dimension. This allows the authors to formulate the cautious claim \"preserving the feature dimension, the expressiveness of equivariant GNNs employing steerable features up to type-L may not increase as L grows.\"\n\nI update my rating to 6, marginally above acceptance threshold."

                "value": "1. In the definition of k-hop geometric GNNs, k is not defined (its role is not defined).\nActually, the definition of k-hop GNN is a bit overlooked (although it's rather intuitive what the meaning of k-hop is), and more importantly, it is not clear to me how these are not essentially equivalent to regular GNNs with more layers (since a single layer of a 2-hop GNN aggregates information with a similar receptive field as a 1-hop GNN with 2 layers).\nProbably authors should elaborate on that or cite appropriate references.\n\n2a. About Lemma 1, page 4. When you define the function c, why can't it simply be always the identity? One could always choose the neutral element from the group G.\nI do understand why the set {g \u2208 G | g \u00b7 c(G \u00b7 X) = X} is not empty.\nI do not understand what is non trivial about c(G \u00b7 X)\n\n2b. Also, V_0^{\u2295d} is not explicitly defined early enough. What is d ? Does it relate to the maximal rotation order L ?\n\n2c. You proove that the decomposition of Lemma 1 is unique. But, concretely, what is lambda ? Isn't it almost always simply the norm of the irrep ? Like, for a vector, its norm, or for a higher-order tensor, also its norm ? And then \\rho(g_X) is just the usual (matrix) representation of g_X.\nCan it be otherwise ? Or is it more complicated ? Am I missing the point ?\nIf in practice things are simple, in most of the usual settings, saying so is helpful to the reader.\nOR, maybe g_X simply encodes the orientation of X (say if it's a vector)?\n\n\n2d. In ref [16], page 3, it says:\n|At initial-\n|isation, we assign to each node i \u2208 V a scalar node colour\n|c i \u2208 C \u2032 and an auxiliary object g i containing the geometric\n|information associated to it\n|i.e. they already separate (factorize) the scalar (feature only) contributions from the geometric ones (vectorial one v + previous color).\nIn this respect it is not obvious how contribution (1) (your lemma 1) is new.\nFurthermore, I lack an intuitive view of what may concretely go into your scalar function lambda(X).\n\n\n3. gothic{g} appears in the r.h.s. of Eq (4) or in the last line of the previous est of equations (let me call this last line Eq. 3bis) (actually the gothic-style has been forgotten in Eq. (4), this is a typo I believe).\nHow can we identify the right term in the r.h.s. of Eq. 3bis as a lambda (invariant), when g^-1 appears in it ? I don't see why g^-1\\cdot x_ij should be invariant, on the contrary, it seems to me like an equivariant feature.\n\n\nIn Eq. 7, first line, why isn't it 2l+2 instead of 2l+1 (in the r.h.s.) ? I understood that representing O(3) required one additional component ? Could you provide an intuitive explanation?\n\n4. You write, in page 6:\n|Does any (2l + 1)-dimensional invariant feature \u03bb(X) correspond to a type-l steerable feature f (X)?\nWhich sounds like an interesting question (although ideally I'd like to know the mapping, not just know about its existence)\n|Note that this question is essentially asking whether the space of all type-l steerable features f (X) has a dimension of 2l + 1 since D l (g X ) is invertible.\nBut that sounds like a known fact: using Spherical Harmonics, it is known that  type-l steerable features  need components $h_m$ with  $m\\in[-l,+l]$ to be represented. That is, they need 2l+1 numbers (dimensions)\n\n5. The remark below corrolary 3 is a very strong, original conclusion.\nI think I understand corrolary 3 (altohough I feel like in practice lambda is the norm of the representation, and in that case it's kind of trivial..).\nIn any case I do not see how the remark  \"the expressiveness of learning steerable features is primarily characterized by the feature dimension \u2013 independent of the highest type utilized\"  follows from corrolary 3.\n\n\n6. In table I, I can do the maths for line 1 and 2, but not line 3.\n(5+3+1)*256 = 2304\n(5+3+1)*824 = 7416\nbut then,\n(1+3+5+7+9+11+13)*256 =12544 , not 7424\n\n\n7. experiments are a bit disappointing.\n7a. First, Table 2 shows a number of red (intersting) cases, but they turn out to be related to eSCN being SO(3)-eqivariant, when the task is O(3). This is not making the point of the paper, and instead is rather confusing, at first sight.\nMost importantly, it's not clear to me in which sense table 2 is different from the table 1 of ref [16] (which by the way seemed more readable and dense).\nPlease clarify this.\n\n7b. IS2RE. Table 3.\nHere I enjoyed a lot the idea of comparing models with comparable feature dimension.\nHowever, several points:\n- why not report also the total number of parameters ? They do not grow as fast as feature dimension since weights are shared for a given L (type order)\n- although I understand it's somewhat hardware dependent, please also report the training time for these models. Maybe even the memory footprint (on GPU).\n- Figure 3 gives an idea of how things perform over a reasonable number of epochs (and I salute the attempt to not go to an exceedingly large number of epochs), but it seems that a more thorough study of variations with L and c, reporting only the epoch=12 validation performances, would be useful to the reader (I did not have time to look at the content of ref [5])\n\n7c. S2EF. Table 4 is commented, but no conclusion stands out. What is the point of that table ?\n\n\n8. Conclusion. Two key findings are claimed:\n| (1) Propagating steerable features of type \u2265 1\n| equips geometric GNNs with the inherent ability to automatically capture the geometry between local\n| structures. (2) When the feature dimension remains constant, increasing the use of steerable features\n| up to type-L cannot essentially improve the performance of equivariant GNNs\nBut I think that  (1) is vague and already known. For instance from (16), which clearly distinguishes invariant (L=0) from equivariant L>=1\nnetworks.\nAnd that (2) is known as oversquashing and was known before.\nI note that the term oversquashing is absent from the manuscript, although it is mentionned several times in [16].\nI think the term should appear. If it sounds too buzzwordy to the authors, they should mention it at least once, and explain why they don't like it."

They use the notion of equivariant moving frames to connect invariant features with equivariant features, illustrating that any equivariant activation space can be converted to an invariant activation space of equal dimension, so long as the frame is tracked (via an input-dependent group element). With this perspective, they show that k-hop invariant GNNs lose some geometric information relative to equivariant GNNs, but that the particular representations internal to equivariant GNNs matter less (in some sense) than the dimensions of the representations."

Moreover, the insights presented in the paper are prescriptive, and give a rule of thumb for selecting hyper parameters such as the highest \u201cL\u201d (indexing the irrupts of O(3) or SO(3)) to include, and how many channels to use. The use of equivariant moving frames to convert to invariants is uncommon elsewhere in the literature, and its application to expressivity considerations is creative. The paper is generally clear and well-written. The authors\u2019 theoretical claims, and even some less rigorous intuitions, are backed up with large-scale experiments on cutting edge architectures for the OpenCatalyst dataset."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. My main qualm is with Corollary 3 and similar statements. In this Corollary, the authors note that given an equivariant function on a k-dimensional input representation space, it can be converted to an equivariant function on any other k-dimensional input representation space. As a result, they claim that the choice of representation to which the internal activations of a neural network transform is irrelevant (modulo its dimension). However, the conversion mapping from one equivariant vector space to a different (equal-dimensional) equivariant vector space may be arbitrarily complex or difficult to compute, and indeed, it may or may not be computable with a given architecture. In the case of rotations, one needs to recover g from a faithful representation (e.g. l=1), and then evaluate another representation at g \u2014 but computing a Wigner D matrix of high L may take many layers/parameters in the GNN. This is in the same spirit as universality results, which e.g. require increasing numbers of layers to approximate polynomials of increasing degree (see e.g. the appendix of Bogatskiy et al 2022, Lorentz Group Equivariant Neural Network for Particle Physics). In other words, there is a critical distinction between whether the **information** to compute a particular mapping is available, and whether a given architecture can actually **efficiently compute** that mapping. The authors of this work seem to focus more on the former perspective; namely, whether or not there is information loss from a certain architecture, which precludes one from ever computing a particular function (by any means). This has been a fruitful perspective for existing impossibility results on invariant GNNs \u2014 since these results roughly establish that, by only working with invariants, some neighborhoods are indistinguishable, and so **no** architecture can distinguish between them. This is a strong notion, but the converse does not hold: when the information is **not** lost, this does not imply that any architecture can actually compute the mapping. All of this is to say that, in my opinion, Corollary 3 does not sufficiently imply that the choice of equivariant representation is irrelevant up to dimension. I suspect even that the choice of representation may affect the universality of a fixed architecture family.\n2. On a related note, many of the paper\u2019s claims are informal \u2014 e.g. \u201cthere is no fundamental distinction in message-passing mechanisms arising from different values of L\u201d in Remark 3, or \u201canalyzing the message passing using the corresponding invariant features is a reasonable approach\u201d on page 4. It would be very helpful and important to make these precise. \n3. There are a few very related lines of work which aren\u2019t cited, but probably should be. For example, the paper\u2019s reasoning relies heavily on the concept of \u201cequivariant moving frames,\u201d which are a classical notion (dating back to Elie Cartan); yet this term does not appear in the paper, nor does a citation to e.g. Puny et al\u2019s frame averaging paper, which is a more recent machine learning paper that harnesses the concept of frames. A small section (the start of Section 3.2 on page 6) in this paper also notes that the output symmetry of an equivariant function must be at least the input symmetry; this is a well-established fact about equivariant functions, e.g. see Smidt et al 2021. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, related ideas were discussed in ClofNet (Du et al 2022) and its follow-up LeftNet (Du et al 2023), both of which use the precise idea of moving frames and invariantization to obtain equivariants from invariants. The latter work in particular includes an expressivity result for two-hop geometric GNNs. \n\n\nReferences:\n* Frame Averaging for Invariant and Equivariant Network Design by Omri Puny,\u00a0Matan Atzmon,\u00a0Heli Ben-Hamu,\u00a0Ishan Misra,\u00a0Aditya Grover,\u00a0Edward J.
