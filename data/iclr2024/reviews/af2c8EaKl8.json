The experiment results on both Mojuco and atari shows that it's better in both offline and online finetuning. The discussion section shows that the model generalizes better in RTG and dependes more on state in a meaningful way."

The authors' empirical studies demonstrate that the previous designs of the transformer for RL (e.g., decision transformer) could be an inefficient overparameterization mainly due to the lack of exploiting Markov property, which is a common assumption in RL. As a part of utilizing Markov property, the authors propose a new transformer model (which is a variant of MetaFormer), called Decision Convformer (DC). They empirically show the efficacy of DC in various environments, in particular, when Markov property holds."

The convolution filtering helps to reduce the number of model parameters (in particular, the number of token mixer parameters) and provides performance gain in offline RL settings (in particular, in hopper and antmaze datasets).\n\nIn the case of weak Markov property, the authors also propose DC^{hybrid}, which uses both the convolution filtering and the attention model. The hybrid DC showed superiority in Atari datasets, compared to DT.\n\nThe proposed DC and DC^{hybrid} might provide new promising options for model architectures in deep RL."

In my understanding, just DT with a small K (i.e., short context length) could be sufficient and show comparable to or even better than DC. Additional comparisions (in terms of performance and computational complexity) on DC and DT with different choices of K would be helpful. Otherwise, it is unclear whether the gain of DC (or hybrid DC) is mainly from the good combinations of hyperparameters (including the embedding dimension, GELU, K, ...), or indeed the convolution filtering. \n\nIn addition, the advantage of the proposed method (DC) is particularly remarkable in hopper and antmaze datasets. In fact, the gap between DC and DT is not significant in other environments. It seems necessary to clarify the environment-specific gain of DC over DT."
