                "value": "The paper considers the problem of evaluating the quality of a pretrained model (for classification) without any data from or knowledge of the downstream tasks for which it will be used. The idea is to generate binary classification data from a Gaussian mixture model and evaluate how well the representation separates the two classes relative to a theoretically optimal classifier. Models are evaluated in terms of standard accuracy and $\\epsilon$-robust accuracy (in a certain adversarial sense). Depending on the experiment, evaluation metrics are based on CIFAR10, SVHN, TinyImageNet, or the average performance over the 27 benchmark tasks from the CLIP paper.\n\nGenerally, this paper was interesting to read and clear, but there are some issues that need to be addressed before it is ready for publication."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* The paper assumes that the raw input data for each class has a Gaussian distribution. In computer vision, this means assuming that, in pixel space, two visual categories have Gaussian distributions. This is akin to assuming we start with quite a good representation! What's the point of representation learning if that's where we start? Why would you transform your data? \n* One of the key claims of the paper is that the \"Pearson correlation between SynBench-Scores and the average real-life task accuracy is larger than 0.9\". Flipping to Table 7 in the appendix, we learn that these Pearson correlations are based on $n=5$ data points! It is statistically unacceptable to make this claim without reporting confidence intervals. Running through the [standard calculations](http://faculty.washington.edu/gloftus/P317-318/Useful_Information/r_to_z/PearsonrCIs.pdf), it seems to me that the confidence interval for the Pearson correlation of 0.92 would be $[-0.81, 1.0]$. That is, this correlation value is not very meaningful. This seems to be a highly misleading error, but I'm eager to be corrected if I'm off base on this point. In the absence of this claim, there is little evidence that \"real world\" task performance is related to the scores computed in this paper. \n* There are many hyperparameters in this paper and no mention of hyperparameter tuning, e.g \"$a_t$ ranging from 0.7 to 0.9\" or \"$\\epsilon$ from 0 to 0.8\" or \"attack strength 0.2\" etc. Can details be provided? If not, the reader should probably assume that the hyperparameters are charitable to the proposed method. \n* SimCLRv2 has the highest SynBench-Score in Table 1, but is generally understood to perform more poorly than the other techniques in the table in common evaluation protocols (see e.g the papers for DINO, BYOL, MAE, or other more recent methods). No mention is made of this in the discussion. This seems like a fairly large problem for the proposed method. \n* The paper considers CIFAR10 and TinyImageNet as \"real-life downstream data\" (see Sec. 4.3) - I think many in computer vision would disagree with this characterization. \n* The paper cites Zoran and Weiss 2012 to support the claim that natural image statistics can be well-represented by GMMs. However, that work focuses only on small image patches and (as far as I know) makes no claim that entire natural images can be well-represented by GMMs. Isn't this a misleading use of that reference? (Appendix A.1)."

                "value": "See \"Weaknesses\" for supporting details on these questions.\n1. A few big picture conceptual questions: Why should we even think it's possible to evaluate the quality of a representation for arbitrary classification tasks without any knowledge or data related to downstream tasks for which it will be used? Moreover, why should we think it's possible to boil that down to a single scalar? What does \"quality\" even mean without reference to downstream tasks?\n2. Are the Pearson correlations appropriately reported (see weaknesses)? Absent that, is there strong evidence that the method in the paper produces scores that are predictive of performance on downstream tasks? \n3. Why is it not a problem for the proposed method that SimCLR has the highest score in Table 1, despite being generally understood to underperform DINO and supervised pretraining? \n4. The Gaussian assumption is basically an assumption that we start with a very good representation - this seems pretty unrealistic. Why would we bother transforming our data with a pretrained model at that point? \n5. Is the reference Zoran and Weiss used appropriately in Appendix A.1? \n6. How were the hyperparameters in this paper tuned?"
