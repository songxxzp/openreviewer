                "value": "The authors propose an approach for solving two stage robust optimization that empirically solves previously intractable problems. The setting considers optimization problems where a set of initial decisions are made, and then a worst-case setting is evaluated and in that worst-case setting the decision-maker can make second-stage decisions to react and ideally improve their deployment. Here the first stage solutions are evaluated based on how robust they are to adversarial settings considering that the decision-maker can react in a pre-specified manner. As this problem considers the nesting of 3 optimization problems it\u2019s empirically very difficult to solve. The standard method here is to maintain a main problem, and then add worst-case scenarios modeling them as cutting planes. The issue here is that due to the inherent multi-level optimization problem, these problems are intractable. The proposed approach is to approximate the value of the lower-level problem in each of these settings using a neural network and then embed the neural network in the outer optimization formulation. Here the neural network is trained to take in a first stage decision as well as a setting and output a value estimating the quality of the best possible second stage recourse given the first stage solution and setting. As such, finding the worst-case adversarial setting amounts to optimizing the output of the neural network value estimator, and finding an estimate of the best possible first-stage solution amounts to optimizing over all possible settings, the output of the neural network estimator. They demonstrate performance on a robust two stage knapsack setting and a capital budgeting setting, demonstrating that their approach can give high-quality solutions in tens of seconds which aren\u2019t solvable by previous methods in 3 hours. The approach demonstrates scalability, and the authors also prove convergence guarantees demonstrating that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge in finite settings."

By embedding a neural network in the subproblem solver as well as the top-level solver they ensure that the deployed solution is guaranteed to satisfy the constraints and be robust to the enumerated settings. Furthermore, by working with an exact solver, and using the true objective function, the authors guarantee that the resulting objective value of the top-level problem is an objective value corresponding to the first-stage solution for an actual setting."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The main weakness is that the scope of impact is somewhat limited to two stage robust optimization. It might be helpful to expand somewhat on where this approach might be useful by giving some examples that are two stage robust optimization from the cited survey on adjustable robust optimization. Alternatively, it might be helpful to give some examples on ways that this can be readily extended to cover more flexible problems such as general-purpose multi-level solver.\n\nAdditionally, it is not the first use case of embedding neural networks in optimization to solve hard optimization problems as this was previous done in the cited Dumouchelle 2022 paper. However, this is certainly not a direct extension of that work as the neural network is embedded both in the subproblem as well as the main problem in a manner that is cohesive with the optimization formulation to ensure convergence guarantees and which mimics the original solver.\n\nOne slight weakness might be that there are limited baselines. However, it should be noted that there are not many general-purpose solvers in these settings. Would it be possible to compare against a na\u00efve extension of Dumouchelle 2022? It might be possible to train a neural network to take in as input only first stage decisions and output the value of all subsequent decisions. It might be computationally expensive to create a training dataset as one would have to evaluate first stage solutions; however, it may be possible. It seems that might be more difficult for a neural network to model, but potentially give a heuristic solution with one solver call.\n\nAnother slight weakness is that there are not many settings evaluated outside of two knapsack-like settings. It might be helpful to demonstrate this approach on other two stage robust optimization settings with potentially more complex feasible regions that would potentially be more difficult for the neural network to model."

It seems that the adversarial problem is the minimization over xi. Is the second stage problem the optimization over y?\n\nAre the samples used for training randomly drawn before any solving happens? Are those samples representative of the settings in which the optimization will be occurring over? For instance, the optimization may be performed over a very different part of the feasible space than what was used for sampling. It would be interesting to see a measure of accuracy for the learned models over time at different stages of the solving process.\n\nWhat does the solving performance look like over time? The solution qualities are somewhat similar whereas the runtimes are drastically different. Is it the case that the baseline very quickly jumps to high quality solutions and stays there? Or does it continue to improve gradually. You might consider evaluating a form of primal integral measuring the performance of the first stage solutions over time. As a quick solution, you might also consider evaluating the solution quality at around the same time it takes the Neur2RO model to terminate.\n\nIt would help to have notions of error on the statistics since some of the relative errors are somewhat close.\n\n\nSmall comments:\nP6, experimental setup 2RO Problems\nAs larger or larger -> as large or larger"

The key idea is to use DNN to learn the input to objective value mapping of the stage-2 problem. Then, the DNN model is embeded into the original stochastic programming problem as a mixed integer programming formulation. The idea of the paper is similar to that in [R1]. The authors are suggested to explain the key differecens the these two papers and show the contribution of the paper clearly. \n\n2. In paragraph 4 of Sec. 3.2, the authors mention \"Prediction inaccuracy is then compensated for in equation 4a by exactly modeling the second-stage cost. As a result, when solving the MP, the true optimal first-stage decision for the selected scenario will be the minimizer, rather than a potentially suboptimal first-stage decision based on any inaccuracy of the learning model.\" This is not easy to follow. The authors are suggested to express it more clearly.\n\n3. To accelerat the column and constraint genration algorithm using DNN, one straightforward approach is using DNN to predict the worst-scenario for the stage-2 problem and then add the obtained scenario to the main problem. The authors are suggested to explain why this straightforwrd design will not work. Otherwise, the authors are suggested to use this straightfoward design as a baseline approach to show the superiority of the proposed approach. \n\n4. The authors are suggested to use more real-world problem as the case study. For example, the robust unit commitment problem in power system operation.\n\n5. The authors are suggested to analyze the impact of the DNN prediction errors to the performance (such as convergence and optimality gap) of the proposed approach.\n\n\n\n[R1] Patel, R.M., Dumouchelle, J., Khalil, E. and Bodur, M., 2022.
