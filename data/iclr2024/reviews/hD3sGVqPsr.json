The authors carefully deal with the reformulation to make the algorithm can sufficiently incorporate the desire for sample selection.\n\n3) The authors conduct a range of experiments on the representative datasets like small dataset CIFAR100-LT, the mid-scale ImageNet-R, and large-scale iNaturalist.

The other choice like introducing a hard equality constraint about the mass of the virtual cluster and applying the lagrange multiplier can be also possible. The main concern here is that the authors introduce two hyperparameters for weighted KL: one is for the target clusters, i.e., \\lambda, and the other is the large value for the virtual cluster.  How is the performance of directly constraining the equality about 1-\\rou with lagrange multiplier compared with Eq.(13).\n\n2) It is not clear why the authors have not compared with the clustering with self-labeling by Asano from the perspective of OT. For SPICE, the performance reported in the appendix is also not convincing. How is the performance comparison of SPICE and P^2OT on the balanced datasets. It will be provide more comprehensive comparison here on both imbalanced datasets and balanced datasets to show their pros and cons.\n\n3) In the perspective of representation learning, some related works should be included with the proper discussion, e.g., about the self-supervised long-tailed learning, like SDCLR [1], BCL [2] and re-weighted regularization, as they also target to representation learning of imbalanced data without label information. Some proper comparison will be better.\n\n[1] Jiang, Z., Chen, T., Mortazavi, B.J. and Wang, Z., 2021, July. Self-damaging contrastive learning.

                "value": "1. Great computational cost. In Figure 5, it takes 1 second to estimate the pseudo-labels when K=40. It is impossible in practice with a larger number of clusters, eg, imagenet, and mini-batch training.\n2. Missing comparisons on balanced datasets. The true data distribution is unknown in real-world applications. This paper only investigates the settings of imbalanced data or tests on balanced data. It is not well aligned with most literature of deep clustering.\n3. This paper does not learn representations, which may be confusing and needs to be clarified. In addition, this paper uses a large pre-trained model and lacks a simple baseline with representation learning models. For example, BYOL or DNIO pre-trained on ImageNet can be used to extract the representations for subsequent K-means clustering. In such settings, we do not need to determine whether the data is imbalanced, as each sample belongs to a single class or a large number of clusters can be pre-defined.\n4. A good evaluation metric should be important for imbalanced deep clustering. Under the imbalanced setting, no samples may be assigned to tail classes during Hungarian matching. As we can see in Figure S7, the predictions of the proposed method are more uniform than baselines. There are more samples assigned to tail classes, though this is not true in training data. It confirms that a uniform clustering result is beneficial for evaluation. I suggest that kNN evaluation in representation learning can be adopted for imbalanced clustering, without the need of Hungarian matching. Due to the uniform constraints, more discussion should be paid to Huang et al., 2022.\n\nAlthough I have raised many questions, I think this paper is interesting, and I will keep/increase my score if the authors have addressed my concerns."

I don't think Eq. 5-Eq. 6 are necessary. You can consider introducing Eq. 8 directly after Eq. 3 by introducing a virtual cluster. If I am wrong, please point it out.\n3. The technical contributions are overclaimed. It appears that the most important aspect of the proposed method lies in the KL constraints. If these KL constraints are added to other clustering baselines, the superiority of the proposed method will be marginal. Additionally, gradually increasing the number of high-confidence samples has been widely adopted in other clustering papers such as SPCIE. It is true that the proposed method can avoid manual selection, but it still introduces an additional hyperparameter in Eq. 7, i.e., $\\rho_0$. More importantly, it does not demonstrate the superiority over the baselines.\""
