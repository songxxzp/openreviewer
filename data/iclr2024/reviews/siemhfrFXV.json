                "value": "1. The authors mentioned in the abstract that most methods for determining the structure of proteins rely on sequential information but tend to ignore structural information, which I also agree with. But I'm wondering why the authors chose the X-ray diffraction pattern as input: why not simply encode protein structure with atomic positions instead of inferring electron density, and if it's indeed necessary to predict electron density map, is it possible to use train a neural network which can achieve near-DFT accuracy?\n\n2. The authors claimed that the tokens from the additional partial structure are from the initial embeddings and will not be passed to the following layers because they are used as a stable reference to attend in each layer. However, I doubt whether this really helps improve model performance: while the embeddings of Patterson Map are updated in the latent space, it seems more acceptable to me that the embeddings from partial structures should also be updated.\n\n3. Can the authors clarify the dataset sizes? In the section New Datasets, about 24000 protein structures are picked out, while the dipeptide dataset seems to have 2M data in total. Besides, is there any reason that the datasets are split into training and test sets instead of training, validation, and test sets, or implementing k-fold cross-validation?\n\n4. Why is there a lack of comparison with baselines for experiments on 15-residues?\n\n5. How does the attention work when performing refining training? To be specific, how are the embeddings from the original training run's predictions concatenated to the input, and are the embeddings kept constant for stable reference or updated in each layer?\n\n6. The authors provide abundant evidence to illustrate the reduced computation costs of CrysFormer in terms of the time needed, but I'm wondering how the memory cost of the model compared with baseline models."

Protein crystallography, partial structure information, or sequence information?\n- The lack of real cases in the dataset might considerably constrain the efficacy of your proposed method. Why haven't the authors utilized datasets of current crystal structures for small proteins? What hurdles have they come across in this regard? Are the obstructions due to a shortage of data, challenges in generalization, or issues with the model's scalability?\n- The authors have mentioned AF2 in the abstract, but the content of the manuscript does not seem to have an apparent relation to AF2.
