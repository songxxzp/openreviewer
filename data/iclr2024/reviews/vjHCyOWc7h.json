Although some studies on multiplex graphs exist, the scarcity of research on multi-group community detection may be due to the difficulty of the topic or its limited occurrence in the real world. Please clarify the reasons behind the lack of research or provide examples from the real world to support the importance of this study.\n\nW2. The paper lacks novelty. While the authors mention Stanley et al. (2015) as existing literature on multi-group community in multiplex graphs, the paper only highlights the difference between this work and Stanley et al. (2015) in terms of the learning of layer-to-group assignments, with the former using the EM algorithm instead of k-means. What are the challenges in replacing k-means with the EM algorithm? Are there any differences in the modeling assumptions between this paper and Stanley et al. (2015)?\n\nW3. The experimental section is weak. Firstly, the paper does not compare the proposed model, which incorporates layer-to-group assignments, with other models that handle multiplex graphs but do not consider layer-to-group assignments [1,2,3,4]. This comparison is necessary to highlight the importance of layer-to-group assignments. Secondly, the datasets used in the experiments are relatively small, while real-world data often exhibit large-scale characteristics. What is the time complexity of the proposed algorithm? Can it handle large-scale data?\n\nW4. The references are incomplete. For example, [1,2,3,4] are all methods for multilayer graphs, but the authors did not cite them. Although [4] focuses on dynamic networks, its modeling approach for generating multilayer networks is similar to the approach in this paper. I recommend that the authors cite and analyze this reference.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Han Q, Xu K, Airoldi E.

However, the basic architecture of the model is not very clearly for me. To my understand, the underlying layers are proposed for the simulation of multiplexity of a graph. Each layer is partitioned into $K$ groups and each group is partitioned further into blocks (a bit weird, probably I have a misunderstanding here). The probability of presence of edges depends on the vertex-to-block assignments and the probability matrices for inter and intra blocks, just like the traditional SBM. But how do we understand that a layer is generated from a group? A layer has several groups, so I wounder how to generate this layer from a single group and how to understand vector $\\beta$ and $y_{lk}$. A simple example would be much helpful, but there isn't.

Compared to existing variational estimation-maximization technique for community detection, this reduces the complexity of parameters that need to be fitted which is desirable for high-dimensional datasets."

Only two naive approaches, K-means and the native SBM, are used as competing methods -- even though their drawbacks were made abundantly clear in the paper. Here, some validation on how well the communities in recovered multiplex SBM describes/generate the observed data in comparison to other community detection methods would be useful instead of only considering the two individual steps of the presented approach independently. Such a comparison might also contain synthetic SBMs with only shared groups as assumed by many existing techniques as a baseline and their failure to capture non-shared groups (highlighting the improvement of the new MSBM method). \n\nThe description of task 5.1 is confusing as it is initially refereed to as the vertex-to-block assignment task, but within the same paragraph it is described how the NMI is used to evaluate the layer-to-group association. I am assuming you compared your method which takes all layers into account to 30 independently fitted SBMs which does not seem like a fair comparison; however, this might just be a misunderstanding due to the confusing structure of 5.1 and 5.2. and missing details regarding the actual tasks that are performed. \n\nFor the task 5.2 multiple multiplex SBMs with different parametrizations should be considered to sample synthetic data for the graph clustering, like e.g. varying block or group sizes and varying blocks across layers. It is also not clear to me which different graphs clusters the task 5.2 tries to recover as only a single parametrization of an SBM is given. I am guessing that the clustering is not done on the level of Multiplex graphs, but on the level of their individual layers as graphs which then leads to a very small dataset of just 30 graphs with 3 very distinct inter-block probabilities that might be considered trivial to recover in monolayer graphs. It is not clear to see how recovering these graphs is an improvement to the state of this art. To highlight potential benefits various other graph clustering methods should be considered. However, this might also be a misunderstanding because initially I would have expected a clustering of the actual multiplex graphs based on their MSBMs when hearing \u201cGraph clustering\u201d. \n\nFurthermore, I would have liked to see the impact of larger graphs have on the computational complexity as currently only small graphs of size 100 are considered. This is especially crucial as you mentioned that other competing approaches like MLSBMs suffer from exponentially large parameter space which drawbacks should be highlighted on large graphs. For this the runtime or some similar measure should be included in the results. Additionally, the impact of varying levels of noise on recovering the clusters would also be an interesting addition to the synthetic experiments.\n\nRegarding the real-world application, it seems as task 1 was to differentiate between real datapoints and randomly generated data points which also seems to not be a suitable benchmark. Task 2 seem to differentiate the article-article graphs from two different datasets which however makes me wonder what the two rows for each dataset in Table 4 refer to as I would expect a single group-to-layer resp. vertex-to-block classification result. Maybe you can clear this up by properly introducing how the mutual information is used in this task. I also would like to ask why the adjusted mutual information (adjusted to random chance) was not used instead.\n\nIn summary, despite the well-motivated need for methods such as this, the promising underlying idea and sound theoretical foundation, it is not clear that the presented methods actually achieve this or improves the state-of-the-art. The experimental section does not quantify the quality of the recovered (Mixture) Multiplex SBM as it only shows that it performs better in the two individual steps compared to very na\u00efve approaches."

But inherent limitations of Multiplex graphs like the requirement of actors to be identical across types of interactions/layers are not addressed or mentioned. Although being a very powerful tool, it most likely is not the solution to all complex multi-dimensional datasets. I would like the authors to very briefly address and differentiate this to Multilayer Graphs (where inter-layer edges are used to model an n-to-m mapping between actors of nodes) and, potentially, outline how the presented approach could be generalized (or not) to this data representation as part of future work.\nThe categorization of existing techniques into flattening, consensus and direct approaches and the placement of the new approach overall seems reasonable, however the third category of \u201cdirect approaches\u201d seems to be very broad and might benefit from being further subdivided.   \n\nFurther questions:\nIt is not completely clear to me why similar results could not be achieved through consensus-based approaches that support some relaxation of the consensus across all layers to only consensus across groups of layers exhibiting similar community structures and allowing a disagreement between layers of different groups akin to the approach in this paper.\n\nWhat does \u201cLayers of the same strata present their groups,\u2026\u201d mean?

How different are the minimizers that the algorithm converge to at different runs? And how would you interpret these different minimizers?\n2. In the case of graph related modeling, it often appears that a simple spectral initialization can already give a pretty decent result. How much improvement is actually achieved by using variational EM after the spectral initialization? And without using spectral initialization, is the variational EM still capable of numerically finding a good local minimizer given sufficiently many iterations? If yes, how much iterations is saved by using spectral initialization?"

Detecting this structure amounts to performing two partitioning tasks at once: on the one hand, the layers need to be partitioned into groups (to determine which layers are generated by the same stochastic block model). On the other hand, for each group of layers, the corresponding block structure (partition of nodes) needs to be detected.\nThe authors estimate the partition of layers into groups by Estimation Maximization and estimate the partition of nodes into blocks by Variational Estimation Maximization."

                "value": "While the introduction is pleasant to read, I felt that it did not properly prepare me for the convoluted problem setup that unfolded in Section 3. Only after reading section 3 several times and going back and forth between section 3 and the introduction, did I finally understand that we are simultaneously clustering layers into groups and nodes into blocks. While I really like the problem setup, it really needs to be explained much better in order to make the reader understand how different it is from the 'normal' clustering problem. In particular, emphasis needs to be put on the difference between groups (sets of layers) and blocks (sets of nodes).\n\nThere are some notational errors in Section 3: $\\beta_1$ instead of $\\beta^1$ below (2), $ln$ instead of $\\ln$, $[1,L]$ (continuous interval) instead of $\\{1,\\dots,L\\}.\n\nSection 4 is difficult to understand and the presentation (and notation) could be improved significantly.\n\nThe experiments measure the performance by the NMI measure, which is known to be biased towards fine-grained clusterings [1]. I would recommend to either use the Adjusted Mutual Information or the Correlation Coefficient [2].\n \nThe fact that the method achieves 100% accuracy on the layer-clustering in the experiments is perhaps an indication that one should choose more challenging experiments. It is interesting to see how an imperfect layer-to-group performance impacts the vertex-to-block performance.\n\n[1] Vinh, N. X., Epps, J., & Bailey, J. (2009, June).
