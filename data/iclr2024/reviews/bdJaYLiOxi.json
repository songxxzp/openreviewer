For Figure 4a, it is better to use formulation instead of python code to describe the loss functions. For Figure 4b, such a simple architecture may be put in the supplement material. \n2. Changing the position encoding without finetuning may cause performance drop, and splitting the image may break some objects on the edge. A better and more common way is to pad black pixels to the top and bottom of the image. \n3. For the detection and segmentation downstream tasks, it is better to show some cases that the pretrained model helps improve the performance, not just numbers.\n4. For autonomous driving tasks, the localization abilitiy is more important than the classification. Could you provide some visualizations such as attention map or GradCAM to see if the retrieved objects are corresponding to the right location?\n\nOther issues:\n1. For Equation 4, a period should be added in the end of the formula. \n2. All the quotation marks are single quotes. Please use backquote in front of the quoted phrases. \n3. Some of the RADIal is mistaken by RADiaL.\n\nOverall, the proposed model is novel and the zero-shot results are interesting and impressive. However, the writing and lack of discussion lowered the final score. I would like to increase my score if the authors would polish the paper and redraw all the figures using vectorgraph."

Typically, radar data is processed in point cloud format, but raw radar spectra contain more detailed information, though they are harder to interpret. This research focuses on enhancing radar spectra interpretability in the automotive context. It introduces a radar spectra-language model that enables natural language queries about scene elements within radar spectra. To address data scarcity, the study aligns the embedding space of a vision-language model. By fine-tuning for automotive scenes, it improves performance. This learned representation benefits scene parsing, enhancing free space segmentation and object detection when integrated into a baseline model."
