The authors adopt a variant of VQ-VAE to well formulate microenvironment discovery as a codebook learning problem, and propose a novel pre-training strategy specialized for microenvironments, i.e., capturing the dependencies between different microenvironments by randomly masking the codebooks and reconstructing the inputs. Extensive experiments on various datasets, metrics, and data partitions have adequately demonstrated the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, generalization, and robustness. Overall, this paper has solid contributions and is expected to have a great impact on protein engineering, especially protein representation learning and PPI prediction."

More importantly, the definition of the microenvironment takes into account both sequence and structural contextual information, constructing it as a heterogeneous subgraph of the protein graph, which is well suited to existing deep learning models.\n\n(2) One of the main contributions of this paper is the formulation of microenvironment discovery as a codebook learning problem that greatly extends the limited vocabulary of (20 types) amino acids while taking into account the structural context of proteins. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to implement both microenvironment discovery and embedding in a computational way.\n\n(3) A novel pre-training approach for codebook masking modeling has been specifically proposed to capture dependencies between different microenvironments in the learned codebook.\n\n(4) MAPE-PPI inherits the high efficiency of sequence-based methods, while enjoying the structure awareness of structure-based methods, showing a good trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n(5) Adequate experiments, including a variety of datasets, metrics, and data partitions, covering aspects of effectiveness, efficiency, generalizability, robustness, ablation study, and visualization."

The authors are encouraged to explain more about the motivation for doing so and provide more experiments to demonstrate its advantages over previous existing masked modeling approaches.\n\n(2) Why does MAPE-PPI freeze the protein encoder instead of fine-tuning it?\n\n(3) This paper introduces validation sets for hyperparameter tuning and model selection in the data partition, which makes more sense than the previous data partition. The authors have also reproduced the results of HIGH-PPI using the same data partitioning as MAPE-PPI in Tables 1 and 2, right?\n\n(4) Some typos need to be corrected."

                "value": "Cons.\n\n1. The authors mention that \"the complexity of protein structure modeling hinders its application to large-scale PPI prediction\", and emphasize it as an efficiency limitation. Why? It is straightforward to see that complexity modeling hinders accurate modeling. However, it is not clear how it hinders the scalability of modeling and why it is inefficient.\n2. Important references are missing. (i) https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06366.pdf, which does almost the same codebook learning and masked codebook modeling in vision; (ii) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04599-z, which define microenvironments of an amino acid residue and do masked \"token\" prediction. Based on this omitted reference, the innovation of this work is limited. Also, it is inappropriate to claim \"propose... MCM\", since both microenvironments and MCM are pre-defined in the literature.\n3. What is the investigation of vocabulary redundancy? The authors create a sufficiently large vocabulary. Are they redundant? Or what is the relationship between vocabulary size or redundancy and archivable performance?\n4. The efficiency claim is very confusing. \"Extensive experiments show that MAPE-PPI can scale to PPI prediction with millions of PPIs\" seems to suggest an inference efficiency. \"predict unknown PPIs more efficiently and effectively\" also seems to suggest an inference efficiency. However, in the introduction, the authors claim the training efficiency. Also, why the proposed design can enable efficiency? What are the computational and memory overheads of the sufficiently large vocabulary and two-stage training? More detailed time complexity analyses are needed.\n5. Only a single level of sequence similarity is considered. More like 30%, 50%, 90% are encouraged. Meanwhile, as the main results in Table 1, multiple runs of experiments are encouraged to show the prediction stability."
