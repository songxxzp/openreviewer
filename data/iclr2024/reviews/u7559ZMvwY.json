AToP conceptualizes AP into two components: perturbation destruction by random transforms and fine-tu . ning the purifier model using supervised AT. The random transforms aim to enhance the robustness to unseen attacks, while the purifier model reconstructs clean data from corrupted data, ensuring correct classification output regardless of the corruption. The purifier model is fine-tuned through an adversarial loss calculated from the classifier output. The paper presents experiments on CIFAR and ImageNette datasets, comparing AToP with other AT and AP methods. The results demonstrate that AToP achieves good generalization ability against unseen attacks, and maintains standard accuracy on clean examples."

For adversarial training methods, auto-attack is one of the most effective attack methods to evaluate model robustness. This is because models with adversarial training usually show much better results under FGSM, PGD, and other attacks than under the auto-attack. \n\n    However, as indicated by Table 7 and Table 8 in this paper, the trained model even achieves much better robustness under auto-attack than under PGD20, FGSM attacks.\n    From this perspective, the comparisons in Tables 2,3,4,5 can be unfair because models with adversarial training show worst-case robustness under auto-attack while it is not the case for the model trained by the proposed method.\n\n3. Considering the issue in 2, to demonstrate their robustness, the models trained by the proposed methods should be fully tested under different attacks. For example, the CW attack with a large number of steps, and the PGD attack with 1000 steps."

(8) since only the clean sample $x$ is involved in $L_{df}$.\n  - Line 5 of Algorithm 1 is confusing. The notation $g_{\\theta_g}$ is not explained.\n- Some experimental details are not clearly stated.\n  - For evaluation, it is claimed that \"we randomly select 512 images from the test set for robust evaluation.\" It is not clear whether this applies to all results or all compared methods. The comparison may be unfair if different models are evaluated on different test sets.\n  - The \"Ours\" in Table 2,3,4 are not specified: Which RT and purifier model are used? What are the hyper-parameters for the training attack?\n- The results for AToP in Table 8 may be unreasonable. Specifically, considering the accuracy of the same model against different attacks, it is shown that FGSM < PGD < AutoAttack, which is exactly the reverse of common expectations since AutoAttack is believed to be a much stronger attack while FGSM should be the weakest attack.
