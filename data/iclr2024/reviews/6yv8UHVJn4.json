The theoretical results, both for the efficient setting and the inefficient one, are surely improving the state-of-the-art. Indeed, the paper answers different questions raised by prior work (e.g., whether the $\\sqrt{K}$ regret bound was achievable). From an algorithmic perspective, even if the authors employ many existing techniques such as dilated bonus and FTRL with logdet barrier, the novelty is clear. The theoretical analysis is interesting and non-trivial, even if part of it is partially adapted from existing work."

I think the combination of existing techniques to devise a computationally efficient PO-based algorithm with $\\widetilde{O}(K^{3/4})$ regret also has its merits.\n3.
