But here the authors have used directly g, should it be something like b(g) instead of g directly? \n\n- It is unclear why considering the effect of wireless channels directly in the algorithm updates would have additional benefits.

However, Equations (3) and (4) do not provide estimated gradients due to the unknown channel gain $h\\_{j,k}$ and noise $n_{j,k}$ terms. The channel gain and noise can drift the parameter update $\\Phi_k$ to arbitrary directions. Since they are unknown, the direction of the gradient remains unknown and the multiplication of $\\Phi_k$ in Equations (3) and (4) may not yield a gradient vector in the correct direction. With possibly incorrect gradient estimates, it is unclear how the algorithms can converge to the correct solution.\n- The system model multiplies the channel gains directly with the values transmitted by clients. It seems some kind of analog transmission without channel coding is considered. However, in practice, all cellular communication nowadays use digital communication with encoding, where the resulting bit error or noise will have very different mathematical expressions. The current system model and result does not seem to extend to such practical systems. It is further unclear why there is no channel considered in server-to-client communication (Line 3 in Algorithms 1 and 2).\n- The experiments are simplified and do not really have a baseline that is compared with, since FedAvg runs in an idealized setting without channel effects. The paper should compare with baselines in the same system setup (i.e., with channel effects of the same statistics). Some well-known FL algorithms with communication efficiency, such as top-k parameter compression with error feedback, should be compared with too.\n- Only very simple binary classification tasks using MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets and simple models have been considered in the experiments. It is not clear how the algorithms perform with more advanced datasets and models. \n- The writing of the paper needs significant improvement. To me, the main contributions (and especially the usefulness of such contributions) remained unclear before page 5, while pages 6-8 include mostly a list of mathematical assumptions and results with only a limited amount of explanation on what it is useful and novel."

This is in contrast to first-order and second-order methods for federated learning. The paper claims to be the first method that involves the effects of the wireless channel without explicitly requiring the knowledge of the channel state coefficients. Finally, the paper provides theoretical and experimental evidence for convergence and provides an upper bound on the convergence rate for both their one-point and two-point estimators."

                "value": "The experiment set-up is questionable in comparison to existing work, especially when compared to the experiments done in the baseline FedAvg federated learning algorithm. It is not clear why the authors decided to pick only two digits \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d from the MNIST dataset and only \u201cshirts\u201d and \u201csneakers\u201d from the FashionMNIST dataset. On the other hand, the experiments done in the original FedAvg paper were done on the full multi-class datasets, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. \n\nThe results were also only compared to FedAvg, with no comparison done against the competing methods (which also use less communication resources) cited in section 1.1.\n\nThe inconsistency in the 2 examples in Section 4 (Experimental Results) makes the discussion unconvincing without a supporting explanation or ablation study. For the first example, a logistic regression model is used, and the images were preprocessed using a lossy autoencoder, and was based on 2 class-labels from MNIST. The second example uses a different model, without compression and on a different dataset. The results would have been more convincing if the set-ups on the 2 dataset were similar. As it stands, I am unsure if the differences between the 2 examples, as illustrated by Figure 2 and 3, are due to the different dataset or the difference in compression or the different type of model used.\n\nThe experiment results and short discussion left much to be desired. It is not clear what the conclusions are from Figure 2 and Figure 3. Are the number of communications rounds the bottleneck or the number of scalar values the bottleneck? It would be better to provide a clearer discussion of the main advantage of the methods proposed in the paper."

                "value": "1. Why were the experiment set-ups reduced form (only binary labels) of the MNIST and FashionMNIST? Are the results for ZOFL methods limited to experiments for binary classification tasks?\n\n1. Could the evaluation for the 2 examples (Figure 2 and Figure 3) use a similar model and preprocessing? This would help isolate the reason for the difference in performances. For instance, 2P-ZOFL in Figure 2 shows a much faster rate of convergence initially, when compared to FedAvg, but this is not the case for Figure 3. It is not clear if this means that 2P-ZOFL only converges faster in terms of communication rounds only when logistic regression is used and not when multilayer-perceptron is used.\n\n1. For clarity, can the authors provide the main metric of consideration? Are the number of scalar values more critical than the number of communication rounds in the context of the federated learning example? Perhaps it would be clearer if results on the time taken and capacity of the wireless link is provided.\n\n1. In Section 1.1, under communication bottleneck, several competing methods that save communication resources were cited. How do these methods compare to 1P-ZOFL and 2P-ZOFL?\n\n1. It seems that the proofs hold for a general class of perturbation vectors as stated in Assumption 2, beyond vectors that only consists of 2 unique values for every dimension of the vector (in Appendix E.2), which is interesting. Are there experimental results for these vectors?\n\n1. The results were also only compared to FedAvg, with no comparison done against the competing methods (which also use less communication resources) cited in section 1.1."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper has the following weaknesses:\n\n1) The wireless channel model assumed in this work is highly simplistic. Eq. (1) refers to a \"flat fading\" channel which completely ignores the effect of multipath and inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by it, which requires more sophisticated processing at the receiver to mitigate its effect. One cannot simply assume a simple channel model that is unrealistic in order to admit tractable analysis of FL algorithms. Furthermore, in the case of IoT devices for which FL methods are applicable, the channel conditions can vary a lot from more stationary in time to highly time-varying. \n\n2) In the 1P-ZOFL algorithm, how does the device know the value of $\\sigma_h^2$ to be able to send $1/\\sigma_h^2$ to the server? This assumes that the device has knowledge of the wireless channel for the link from itself to the server, which in practical scenarios is only possible if the base station has transmitted pilot/reference signals to the device in prior communication rounds. However, the paper does not specify this at all. Also, the terms $h_{i,k}^{DL}$ are not defined when they first appear.\n\n2) Secondly, most IoT devices (e.g., smartphones, sensors, etc.) as well as the server (which is likely co-located at the cellular base station) have multiple antennas (i.e., MIMO technology) which make estimating the wireless channel not equivalent to estimating a single real-valued scalar value. This may render some or all of the derivations regarding the convergence analysis to be inapplicable.\n\n3) The experimental evaluation is insufficient. It needs evaluations beyond binary image classification. Also, evaluation on more realistic channel models, e.g., those specified by 3GPP such as CDL or TDL models would be helpful to observe the degradation in the proposed algorithms when the assumptions on the channel do not hold."
