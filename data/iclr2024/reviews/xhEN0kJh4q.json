Due to the nature of the optimization problem, it is desirable to learn a model that can judge the fitness of specific sequences.\n\n**Novel Idea**\n\nThis work proposes the learning of a weighted VAE such that high-fitness samples are weighted in the probability distribution. The intuition is that exploration in VAE space is more likely to result in succesful generations with this bias in place. However, all samples can still be used in training the model.\n\nThe PPGVAE is structured so that designs with higher fitness are generated closer to the origin. This means they will be more likely to be sampled when using a normal distribution prior. This is implemented in the form of a constraint between the ratio of log probabilities vs. fitness, and this constraint is relaxed to a weighted penalty.\n\n**Findings**\n\nExperiments showcase that the PPGVAE model can correctly separate between two modes. The modes are defined as the probabilities represented by a two-mode Gaussian mixture model. On protein datasets, the method showcases that the PPGVAE can separate between low and high fitness examples, and that separated models lead to faster convergence when using MBO."

The main concern in current model-based optimization methods is the sparsity of high-fitness samples in training datasets and the separation problem - wherein the desired optimum is situated in a region that is poorly represented and far from low-fitness areas. This paper pinpoints that existing tools do not efficiently handle this separation problem in the design space.\n\nThe authors introduce a new method using Property-Prioritized Generative Variational Auto-Encoder (PPGVAE). This VAE's latent space is structured by the fitness values of the samples, ensuring higher prioritization and generation probability for more desired sequences. This new method aims for better results with fewer optimization steps, which is particularly valuable for sequence design problems.\nA comparative advantage of this approach over prior methods is demonstrated via extensive benchmarks on real and semi-synthetic protein datasets. \n\nThe PPGVAE proves to be superior in robustly finding improved samples, regardless of the imbalance between low- and high-fitness samples and the degree of their separation in the design space. The authors further extend the versatility of their method by testing it on continuous design spaces, showcasing its efficacy on physics-informed neural networks (PINN)."
