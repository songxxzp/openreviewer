Lack of understanding of how the proposed method (LAS) influences the stability and plasticity of continual learners. For example, LAS may remarkably reduce the forgetting of old classes (improve stability) but also, with reduced plasticity, may sacrifice the accuracy of new classes significantly.\n\n3. There are some issues that need to be clarified. In section 6.2, experiments are also conducted on \u201cthe most difficult and realistic online GCL setup\u201d. However, as shown in Table 4 and Table 3, the performance (e.g., ER and ER+LAS) under online GCL setup is much better than that of online CIL, which seems to imply that the online GCL is simpler. Besides, it is known that LUCIR and GeoDL are much stronger than LwF in offline CIL. However, in Table 4, LwF performs remarkably better than LUCIR and GeoDL. The reviewer suggests authors include further clarification about those points."
