Function prediction models are (initially) trained on limited labelled data.\n\nThey use a training scheme that refines both methods in an iterative EM process. In several rounds they first fix the retriever model and use it to predict labels to refine the function predictor model (their E step), then the fix the function predictor model and finetune the retriever model using labels from the predictor as \"pseudo labels\" (the M step).\nSeveral rounds of the EM process produces both prediction and retriever models that have better accuracy that the original model by a significant margin in their evaluation.\nIt is the use of labels for function prediction that are expected to help finetune the similarity (retriever) model."

It is not correct to say that BLAST operates \"under the assumption that proteins with similar sequences likely posess similar functions.\"  BLAST has nothing to do with functional inference, per se.  It identifies evolutionary relationships.\n\nI found retriever/predictor terminology confusing at first.  Please define these terms explicitly.\n\nI was concerned by the baseline method proposed in Section 2.2.  BLAST is a fast heuristic approximation of the Smith-Waterman DP algorithm.  But even SW is not as good at detecting homologies as more advanced methods that rely on profile-profile alignment (e.g., HHPred/HHSearch).  Indeed, even PSI-BLAST (which is part of the BLAST package) is better than BLAST.  So I can't help but wonder why BLAST is being used here.  It's also not at all clear to me that Equation 2 represents a smart way to use BLAST. Indeed, one of BLAST's strengths is its statistical confidence estimation procedure.  As such, treating the BLAST output as an uncalibrated score and then doing ad hoc normalization seems like a bad idea.\n\nThe related work is almost comically dense, as is unfortunately required by this conference format.  But the upshot is that it's very difficult to get a sense for where you think ProtIR falls in terms of novelty relative to all of these prior methods.  The final sentences of the second and third paragraphs are the only hints along these lines.  Rather than a laundry list of existing methods, I'd prefer that you cite a couple of reviews and then use the space to explain how your method relates to the state of the art.\n\nI found it striking that almost all of the related work is from the last few years.  In fact, people have been working hard on this problem for decades.  See, e.g., Melvin PLOS CB 2011 for a retriever-based method that operates on protein embeddings using sequence and structure.  Or see work by JP Vert on kernels for protein sequence similarity.  This review might be a good place to get a sense for the long history in this general area: https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/19/2/231/2562645\n\nMinor: typo \"orignial\": \"v.s.\" -> \"vs.\""

What data set you had available for EC and GO training and testing?\n-- ProtIR iterates between the encoder model and prediction model fine-tuning steps. But, without knowing on what data this happens and what is the relationship between training and test data, it is difficult to imagine what is happening in the experiments. For example, is are fold classification and protein function data sets coming from different distributions? If so, what is the consequence on the experimental results?\n-- the paper is vague when it comes to what neural networks are used as encoder model and predictor model. Only deep into the experimental sections it becomes clear that the same neural network (GerNet or CDConv) is used for both. But, does that mean that there are two copies of the neural net -- one serving as an encoder and another as a predictor?\n-- the paper is inconsistent when it comes to explaining hyperparameters for the experiments\n- using the structure encoders is a major limitation of this approach because it is only applicable on proteins with known structure. Proteins with known structure are a highly biased sample of the protein space and are typically well studied with a good understanding of their functional properties. This, the usefulness of proposed approach is limited"

This makes it difficult to understand where this new method fits in the existing research. Although the paper is in the field of functional annotation, which has a lot of existing research, the authors did not discuss relevant works. Here is a list of some papers that focus on predicting EC numbers, just to give the authors an idea:\n\nEnzyme function prediction using contrastive learning\n\nDeep networks for protein functional inference \n\nECPred: a tool for the prediction of the enzymatic functions of protein sequences based on the EC nomenclature\n\nDeep learning enables high-quality and high-throughput prediction of enzyme commission numbers\n\nIt is important for the authors to do a fair comparison with these existing methods so that people can understand how valuable their new technique is.\n\n------\n\nThe title of Section 5.2 should be revised to accurately reflect its content, as it encompasses benchmarking of predictor-based methods alongside other topics.\n\n------\n\nThe impression conveyed by Table 1 is that predictor-based methods are unquestionably the superior choice for functional prediction. I fail to see evidence to support the claim \"retriever-based methods show promise, enabling accurate function prediction without massive pre-training\". In all evaluated tasks, predictor-based approaches with pre-training consistently outperform retriever-based methods by substantial margins.\n\n------\n\nThe subsection titled 'Predictors vs. Retrievers' in Section 5.2 lacks clarity and fairness in its comparison. The comparison is skewed because retriever-based models like GearNet and CDConv leverage structural information that is not utilized by their predictor-based counterparts.\n\n------\n\nIt is a time-consuming process for me to correlate Table 2 with Table 1 in order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed technique. It appears that the ProtIR framework may enhance predictor-based performance; however, the authors have not opted to demonstrate this in comparison to the best predictor-based method. Is there a particular rationale behind this choice?\n\n------\n\nAlthough Section 5.4 is intriguing, it appears to have a somewhat weak connection to the primary focus of this research."
