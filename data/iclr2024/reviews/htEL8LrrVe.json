To make the contribution clear, please provide some examples and discussions on that in the introduction part.\nIn addition, both the communication protocols mentioned in this paper rely on a coordinator. Why is it a reasonable assumption. Does it make any difference on the results if we change the model to a fully distributed one? \n\nAlso, all the experts are forced to commit to the same expert according to the depicted problem setting. Please provide reasons for making such an assumption. \n\nThe presentation of this work is poor and should be substantially revised.\n\nThe simulation results are too simple without any support of real-world data traces and lack comparison to other related works."

The authors also consider two message passing protocols, namely a protocol in which the central coordinator communicates directly with one server at a time, and a protocol in which the central coordinator can broadcast a message to all servers.

Thus, the losses are l^t_i,j \\in [0,1]. Looking at (generally a subset of) historical data, the algorithm needs to pick an expert at each time step t, so as to minimize regret (as compared to choosing the best possible fixed expert with hindsight). The key distributed twist to the problem is that communication cost is considered alongside regret, thus obtaining obtaining historical data from servers has a cost; in this context, two cost models are considered: message-passing and broadcast. Furthermore, multiple aggregation methods are considered for total loss: in summation aggregation, the cost of an expert is the sum of the cost of an expert across servers; in maximization aggregation, the cost of an expert is the max cost of that expert across servers.\n\nThe paper gives algorithms and lower bounds, and discusses trade-offs between regret minimization and communication minimization. The upper bounds are in the strong (adaptive) adversary model, where an adversary get to observe the full history realization before choosing the costs at the next time step. Lower bounds are in the weaker, oblivious adversary model; this means the lower bounds are more powerful, since they apply even if the adversary is weak. However the lower bounds require memory bounding assumptions; this means that the lower bounds are less powerful, since they only apply when the memory restrictions exist.\n\nThe paper also provides experimental data comparing its algorithms with distributed adaptations of classical multiplicative weights."
