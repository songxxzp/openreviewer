By proposing a diffusion-based model named Language to Control Diffusion (LCD), this paper addressed these issues."

The core idea is to pretrain a state encoder and then utilize the latent diffusion model to instantiate high-level policy, generating high-level goals by following the language instruction. The generated goals are then fed into the low-level policy network to obtain the final action.  The empirical results show performance improvements over the previous approaches. The authors also provided many empirical insights of the utilization of diffusion model for visual decision making tasks, which is valuable."

After going through HULC[Mees et al., 2022a], I just noticed that the encoder is possibly the one in HULC model. Therefore, the author considers both the encoder and LLP to be pretrained. I suggest the author add the corresponding description because it is currently hard to find out this from the logical flow of the paper. It is still important to clarify the training objective and the structure of the state encoder and low-level policy.\n\n2. The novelty of the paper is limited, as it is a combination of diffusion model and HULC.\n\n3. The assumption of the dataset being optimal is very strong in real-world settings, which limits the applicability of the proposed method. \n\n4. The textual encoder -  T5-XXXL model in this paper - is quite large, which increases the inference time. Is it possible to use the textual encoder in CLIP?"

What is the total number of parameters in LCD?\n\n3. Learning state mapping functions and latent planning models separately seems quite reasonable in RL tasks, is there a way to combine a pre-trained encoder on a more extensive visual dataset, similar to models like VQ-VAE used in Stable Diffusion, for state feature extraction, rather than pre-training the encoder solely on robot tasks?"

Can the authors comment more on the difference between the proposed method and previous text-to-video works, such as [1, 2]? Again, the authors mentioned that \"they again avoid the issue of directly generating low level actions by using a low-level controller or an inverse dynamics model which we are able to directly solve for\", but I didn't see the the downside of leveraging low-level controllers.\n3. Besides, I would like to know if these text-to-video methods are directly comparable to LCD in experiments.\n4. It is not very clear to me what dom(P(s'|s, a)) measures and the intuitive sense behind it. For terms that are not commonly used in RL theory, it would be better to state its definition and intuition of the proof/bound. It is also not clear what the circle means in the definition of the low-level policy.\n5. The theorem comes before the practical instantiation of the algorithm. The gaps between theory and practice should be explicitly analyzed.\n\n[1] Learning Universal Policies via Text-Guided Video Generation.\\\n[2] VIDEO LANGUAGE PLANNING."
