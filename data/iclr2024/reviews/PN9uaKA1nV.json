Synthetic data should be anonymous and can help AI researchers build models without touching real private patient data.\n\nTextual data is an important component in clinical data but structured data (vital signs, lab tests) is also critical. This work focuses on clinical text synthetic data generation only and more types of data can be considered as future works. However, the capability of LLMs to generate synthetic structured clinical data is questionable.\n\nThe clinical topics/concepts in section 4.1.1 are picked from KG and LLMs. How many topics are from KGs and how many are from LLMs? How is this ratio determined? Would a different ratio impact results? Why not ask a clinician to hand-pick clinical topics?\n\nThe current SOTA results (regardless of fully supervised or few-shot) should be added to Table 1 as reference points.\n\nD_train in Equation 1 has only K (K<=5) samples per label?"

Will it work on medical records?\n(3) Some of the tasks still have some issues in regards to entity coverage and it looks like generally the performance is low on these tasks.
