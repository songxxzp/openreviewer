All in all, do you agree that this result is not essential for the method? If so, I still suggest moving it to the Appendix. Otherwise, you should explain its importance together with clearer writing.\n\n*On Def 3.1* I believe we agree that there are admissible sets diff from yours and might provide better finite sample performance. So you need to admit and explain this, particularly because your defs of I, C, A are diff from usual.\n\nI still do not agree this method is theoretically guaranteed in a strict sense. You may want to explain in what sense you mean it.\n\n**End update**\n\nAs for the problem of treatment effect estimation under unconfoundedness, the paper proposes to decompose the observed covariates into three disjoint sets, roughly corresponding to the usual concepts of instrumental, confounding, and adjustment variables. The variables are defined in graphical terms, and then reduced to independence relationships, by Theorem 3.2. An adversarial learning approach is proposed to induce the independence.

                "value": "**Some problematic theoretical developments and discussions**\n\n*Th 3.1* (variance lower bound). The statement seems incorrect or has typo(s). For CATE, the bound should depend on the value of x, but your eq of V takes expectation on X. Moreover, for consistent estimators, V should depend on n, and V \u2192 0 as n \u2192 inf, but your V is a constant wrt n. Anyway, I don\u2019t see this result has a strong relationship to the method (or else I will give a lower score), you could remove this result if you cannot fix it.\n\n*Def 3.1* deviates from standard notions in the literature and also has practical limitations. For example, \n\n- in your Fig 1a, if there is an X4 that is a parent of both X1 and X2, this is usually understood as a confounder and can improve the precision of estimation, but is excluded from your approach.\n- your Fig 1b is actually the \u201cM-bias\u201d case (see model 7 [here](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r493.pdf)). X1 and X3 both satisfy the backdoor criteria and could be understood as confounders. Here, besides X3, both X1 and X2, which are excluded from your approach, could possibly improve the precision (though X2 alone is a bad control).\n\nI suggest being clear that the definition is nonstandard, discussing and comparing it to usual notions (possibly in the Appendix). In particular, you should mention there are possible variables in your IVs that are good to add as controls. \n\nSee Questions for more comments.\n\n**The method is theoretically motivated but *not* theoretically guaranteed.** \n\nProp 3.2 seems correct but the learning approach is not sufficient. Taking (i), I agree that independence means larger L_A than dependence, but, there can be many different functions A that give the independence. Worse, some A could take a confounder but \u201ccleverly\u201d through away the dependence on T. Similar comments apply to (ii). Could your theory rule out these concerns?\n\nThe ADR algorithm does not precisely enforce the required independence or even the approach in Prop 3.2, because L_A, L_C, L_I contain both prediction and adversarial terms, so the ADR is a trade-off but not a direct implementation of the theory. Moreover, training the losses together with hyper-parameters adds yet another layer of trade-off.\n\nI suggest weakening the claims on this contribution."

Some further points are as below.\n\nProp 3.1 (i) I think we can say \u201ceither\u2026or\u2026\u201d which is stronger than simply \u201cor.\u201d Also, it is safer to say \u201cX \\indep T and X \\indep Y\u201d which is weaker than the joint independence and seems enough. \n\nIt is confusing to only stress C in the last statement of Th 3.2. In fact, A may also be sufficient, as in your Fig 1b.\n\nThe comments below Th 3.2 are confusing. It is an identification because the 3 sets of variables are determined by the observable joint distribution, through the conditional independence requirements. In fact, the definition of I/C/A implicitly assumes graphical structures, and you reduce the graphical structure to independence by *causal Markov and faithfulness assumptions*. Indeed, these *are* the \u201cfurther assumptions\u201d you also use.\n\nAdd experiments that directly evaluate identification and decomposition. Actually, Fig 3 and 5 show the method does not fully identify and decompose the covariates. Thus, it is meaningful to examine this more closely. For example, we could build several datasets with only one I, C, A respectively, and plot the learned I, C, A against the truth.\n\nAs to identifiable representation, the recent advance in using deep identifiable model (e.g., [1]) to estimate treatment effect (e.g., [2, 3]) is worth discussing in the related work. \n\n[1] Khemakhem, Ilyes, et al. \"Variational autoencoders and nonlinear ICA: A unifying framework.\" International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics. PMLR, 2020.\n\n[2] Wu, Pengzhou Abel, and Kenji Fukumizu. \"beta-Intact-VAE: Identifying and Estimating Causal Effects under Limited Overlap.\" International Conference on Learning Representations (2022).\n\n[3] Ma, Wenao, et al. \"Treatment Outcome Prediction for Intracerebral Hemorrhage via Generative Prognostic Model with Imaging and Tabular Data.\" International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention., 2023.\n\nMinor (did not affect the score):\n\nIt is bad to use the abbreviation ITE for the Individual-level Treatment Effect. Maybe you could use \u201cILTE\u201d instead. Actually, \u201cITE\u201d in your paper refers to both ILTE/CATE and eq1, which is the correct definition of ITE.\n\n\"Adjustment variables\" usually mean the set of variables conditional on which the confounding is removed. Only in some ML papers do adjustment variables refer to those variables that affect Y but not T. This is another often-seen misnomer in the ML community.\n\nThe \\mathcal(L) in Prop 3.2 should be a typo."

The assumptions used in the paper are standard for observational inference (which I view as a strength of the paper). The point that variance bounds are affected by pre-treatment covariate number and that distinguishing between kinds of pre-treatment estimation variance bounds in an effort to improve the bound is intriguing, as is the notion that we can distinguish between pre-treatment covariates of different types in an identified manner. \n\nMy main comments concern the ability of readers to evaluate the contribution of the paper in view of the literature. For example, what is the relationship between the work on semiparametric efficiency bounds in effect estimation with some of discussion here. The literature on, e.g., semi-parametric efficiency is often focused on ATE (as opposed to CATE estimation as here), but even a discussion of the efficiency of the approach here for the ATE vs. in that setting would be most informative for this reviewer. \n\nOn a related note, the paper could further improve its contribution by evaluating observational ATE recovery against some of the most commonly used methods for that (e.g., doubly robust methods and something simple like inverse propensity score weighting). If readers can see that the proposals here by improving observational CATEs also improve observational ATEs (which have extremely broad applicability in existing applied work, much more than observational CATEs), the paper's contribution would be enhanced. \n\nOn another note, the decomposition of I(X), C(X), and A(X) would be extremely useful in practice. However, one limitation is that in any given experiment, we cannot know/validate for sure (and if there is good a priori reason to suspect a covariate is an I, C, or A adjustment could proceed directly with that knowledge). Nevertheless, if the authors could obtain a case (perhaps from, e.g., the biological context where biophysical relations are approximately known) where the decomposition provides useful information to the investigator, I would think the contribution would also be improved. By the way, it would be very convincing if the approach here was somehow better than using a priori knowledge of the decomposition directly. \n\nA few small comments: \n\n(1) Not to sound pedantic, but the writing at the sentence/paragraph level is somewhat stronger than across sections. For example, there is much discussion of the variance bound in the theory section, but this emphasis disappears later on. The paper can sometimes feel disjointed (as if separate contributions are fused). \n\n(2) I would edit the \"Algorithm 1\" text to remove the reference to (I believe) the specific optimizer Adam. Optimizers will come and go with time and presumably, the contribution here is more general, and other optimizers would work as well in principle."

The design of the loss function is somewhat heuristic and a logical explanation or guarantee is insufficient (see Question 2).\n1. The adversarial joint objective is not in a convex-concave formulation, which means there is no guarantee of convergence. Intuitively, it seems very unstable.\n    * Are there any existing studies of such a formulation that *maximizes* the loss function such as the MSE?\n    * While maximizing the MSE by the adversary is easily accomplished by making the predictions infinity, it seems to be difficult to predict it accurately.\n    * It may be helpful to show realistic convergence using a learning curve."

                "value": "1. What is the purpose of the decomposition? The original purpose was to combine weighting only w.r.t. the confounders in DR-CFR, in my understanding. Confounder variables should be limited to necessary ones to alleviate the estimation variance due to extreme weights. The proposed method does not use weighting and thus I am confused about its aim.\n    1. A possible reason for the above question is to limit the input, i.e., excluding instrumental variables from the input of the predictor, as suggested in Thm 3.1. Although, Thm 3.1 is only about the variance lower bound and I am not sure if that is dominant or critical in the estimation error. Does excluding I(x) from the input of the predictor really have a decisive impact? Any theory about the whole risk bound of the proposed method, or an ablation experiment on the \"with-I(x) model\" $f_{C\\cup A\\cup I\\cup T \\to Y}$ instead of $f_{C\\cup A\\cup T \\to Y}$ might provide empirical evidence.\n1. Why $L_A$ does not include the accuracy of $f_{C\\cup A\\cup I \\to Y}$? A(x) is input to $f_{C\\cup A\\cup I \\to Y}$, but the gradient for the connection is stopped. Does not this have any negative impact on the whole design of the optimization procedure?\n\nMinors:\n\n* P4 Theorem 3.2 stats -> states\n* P4 Hassanpour & Greiner (2020). -> [Hassanpour & Greiner (2020)]."

                "value": "The paper introduced a new decomposed representation learning method for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation. It is based on a theoretic property that all the covariates in the valid adjustment set can be either instrumental variables, adjustment variables, confounders, or background noise variables, and that this this decomposition is identifiable from the observational distribution. The paper then develops an adversarial learning technique to decompose the covariates into three categories of instrumental variables, adjustment variables, and confounders. The authors compare their method, namely, adversarial learning of decomposed representations (ADR), with the existing representation learning baselines for CATE estimation on several synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks."

I found the theoretic results of the paper regarding the decomposition of the insightful and important for representation learning for CATE. For example, I appreciate that the authors provided formal identification guarantees for the decomposed representation, i.e., Prop. 3.1 and Theorem 3.2. Also, the experimental results on decomposing, i.e., Figures 3-5, are very informative."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There are several issues in this paper:\n  1. Error in derivations. I spotted two issues. First, Theorem 3.2 claims that $\\mathbf{C}$ is a valid set $\\mathbf{X}\u2019$ in the definition of the instrumental variables. On the other hand, by looking at the example in Fig. 1 (b), $\\mathbf{C} = \\varnothing$, but $X_2 \\notindependent Y \\mid T$. Second, there seems to be an erroneous statement in the proof of Prop. 3.2, that the equality in the expectation $\\mathbb{E} (T \\mid A(X) ) = \\mathbb{E}(T)$ implies the independence, $T \\independent A(X)$, which is not true, if $T$ is continuous. Specifically, there could be inequalities wrt. to higher moments. Those two issues are further very important for the correct implementation of the ADR.\n2. Novelty. The implementation of the decomposed representation learning with adversarial representations, namely, ADR, was already proposed in [1], and this work is not even mentioned in the related work or included as a baseline. Therefore, the paper has only a marginal contribution.\n3. Implementation and tuning. Some details are missing on the implementation of the baselines, e.g., the dimensionalities of the representations.  Also, the authors did not provide any details on how to choose the dimensionalities of the decomposed representations in their method, which is a very important issue in practice, e.g., for the IHDP benchmark. Therefore, it is impossible to say, whether the empirical evaluation was fair.\n\nI am open to raising my score if the authors address all my concerns. \n\nReferences:\n[1] Chauhan, V.
