To generalize to the real-world scenes, the paper focuses on disentangling the learning of object intrinsics and the extrinsic separately.  The proposed approach significantly improves systematic generalization, enabling unsupervised learning of high-fidelity object-centric scene representations from sparse real-world images. The approach allows for the discovery of visually rich objects from a single real image, allowing for applications such as 3D object segmentation and scene manipulation."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. About the motivation\n\nIn the beginning, the paper states that the bottleneck of existing works is the entanglement of object attributes such as shape and appearance with extrinsic properties such as object location. However, there is a lack of concrete evidence to support this claim.  In this paper, why is separately learning per-object locations significantly better than others?\n\n\n2. About the method\n\n2.1. In sec 3.1, the description of Encoder/Latent Extraction Module seems not matched with the provided Figure 2. It's unclear how the two sets of feature maps f_g and f_l are fed into the second module. \n\n2.2. In Latent Extraction Module, for each object, its position p_i^{wd} in the world frame will be learned. In this case, what is the world coordinate? Is it predefined for the whole set of multi-view images of every single scene?  In this case, given two different input images of the same scene, the same 3D object needs to learn exactly the same 3D location. In this way, the network actually needs to learn a separate coordinate system conditioning on every input image, which seems not that sensible if I understand correctly. \n\n2.3. The paper models every object/background by a separate NeRF. How is such strategy able to deal with the potential under/over segmentation of 3D objects? For example, what if two chairs are grouped into a single NeRF (the center of two chairs may be learned as the combined object center)? What if a single chair is learned as two objects at the very beginning? Why will the entire background structure (usually complex) must be grouped into a single NeRF? In practice, there are typically a variable number of objects in each 3D scene to discover. There could be objects that are visible in input image, but invisible in multi-view images, or otherwise. \n\n2.4. The paper states that it incorporates two novel techniques: 1) object-centric prior learning and 2) object-centric sampling. However, in page 5, such two techniques are very briefly described by two small paragraphs. As to object-centric prior learning, what types of priors are planned to be learned? why is it helpful for the subsequent object discovery? As to object-centric sampling, how does it work in  detail and why is it important? \n\n\n3. About the experiments\n\n3.1. For the collected three datasets. How many objects in each image? From the samples in Figure 4, it seems every image has exactly four objects.\n\n3.2. As to the two real-world datasets Kitchen-easy/hard,  the objects are rather simple in terms of both shape and appearance. It's suggested to evaluate on more complex real-world images such as ScanNet[1]. \n\n3.3. For the evaluation metrics of object segmentation, only ARI related scores are reported. It's suggested to report additional metrics such as AP scores as analyzed by [2] in the community of unsupervised object segmentation. \n\n3.4. For the experimental results in Tables 1/2/3, why are the existing methods inferior in both segmentation and novel view synthesis? It's suggested to give more concrete discussions. \n\n3.5. There is a lack of ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed components. \n\n[1] ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes, CVPR'17\n[2] Promising or elusive? unsupervised object segmentation from real-world single images, NeurIPS'22\n\n\n4. Minor suggestions:\n\n4.1. In page 2, the claimed first contribution seems not very meaningful at all. \n4.2. For equations 1/2/3/4/5, it's suggested to use mathematical symbols rather than English words. It's a bit hard to track the meanings.\n4.3. The work ONeRF [3] should be discussed, as it also uses NeRF for unsupervised 3D object discovery. \n\n[3] ONeRF: Unsupervised 3D Object Segmentation from Multiple Views, arXiv'22"

What if you skip the stage 2 and directly train on stage 3 after learning object priors using stage 1? How much will the performance degrade? How much does stage 2 training actually help here?\nAlso, authors mention learning a global representation using ViT and a local representation using shallow UNet. Again, I didn't find an ablation justifying using two separate networks for these representations. Why not use some intermediate layer (or the spatial features) from ViT as local features? What's the intuition behind shallow UNet? Is it to prevent features from different objects entangling with each other? The authors should provide such ablations/intuitions in the main paper."

Consequently, the training pipeline itself lacks a significant degree of novelty.\n\nI have major concerns regarding the utilization of a pre-trained DINO encoder. DINO is already proficient at extracting meaningful and somewhat object-aware features from images, leading to the possibility that the model merely aligns these features with latent variables. This raises questions about how much the proposed pipeline genuinely contributes to object discovery.\n\nThe \"l_pos\" loss, which calculates the positional disparity between object poses from different viewing directions, relies on the fact that, during the initial training stage, there is only one object per scene, eliminating object-matching challenges. However, strictly speaking, the use of a single-object dataset disqualifies the proposed pipeline as an unsupervised model while making the learning problem considerably less challenging. To apply this method to a general dataset, one must manually select scenes containing only one object, a process akin to labeling. In other words, the training pipeline appears tailored specifically for the proposed dataset. While the author presents object-centric prior learning as a contribution, it might be perceived more as a limitation.\n\nThe fixed number of objects in each scene restricts the method, while most object-centric learning frameworks merely set a maximum number of objects in the scenes.\n\nThe limitations of the work are not adequately discussed or disclosed.\nThe ablation study is rather limited in scope."
