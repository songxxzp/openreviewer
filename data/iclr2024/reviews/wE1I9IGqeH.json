                "value": "The paper proposes a continual learning method for image classification. It addresses quite challenging setups as data incremental, class incremental and task incremental settings. The core of their method is a combination CLIP embedding for zero-shot prediction and tree-based kNN exemplar-based model (TreeProbe). The paper presents results a large variety of datasets and compares with a few well-cited continual learning methods from the past decade. CLIP enables open-vocabulary learning (within CLIP training set, of course) and their suggested TreeProbe shows quick training and inference. The two-model combination is inspired by a famous work in continual learning \"complimentary learning system\" that suggests that human brain has two types of memories: fast episodic memory (hippocampus) and slow consolidating memory (neocortex). It's been exploited in continual learning approaches before with limited success."

Typically neural nets suffer from catastrophic forgetting that makes incremental training pointless pretty much. Many attempts were made on solving this problem. \n\nOverall results look very promising. I am happy to not see permuted MNIST in benchmarks.\n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to read. The paper achieves SOTA results although the gap with the other CLIP-based model is pretty small. I found it convincing enough and sufficiently novel."

I couldn't however find a reference.\n\nThe main drawback is that it still relies on CLIP. While we don't know exactly what CLIP was trained on, I find it easy to believe that 400M dataset contains everything that the authors used for evaluation so in a way it is not really continual learning as we would like it to be."

While it is certainly not to compare their method against, it is useful to know \"are we there yet?\" in terms of how practical continual learning has become. It is also useful to know total number of classes that was obtained after merging all datasets."

It seems that the main difference is the use of CLIP encoder which boosts the model zero-shot capability but the core idea of continuously update the zero-shot model is similar. However, there is no discussion or comparison with these prior works.\n\n+ The reviewer also has doubted on the effectiveness of the proposed method as on average task performance the model only improve 0.5% compared the strong baseline ZSCL (as reported in table 1 in the main paper).
