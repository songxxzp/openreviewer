                "value": "The paper under review aim to sample a target distriubtion $\\pi$ over a discrete sapce $\\mathcal{X}$. To this end, they consider a discrete Langevin dynamics approach from (Sun et al 2023) and (Zanella 2020). This approach consists in sampling a continuous time Markov chain with transition matrix:\n$$\nR(x,y) = g(\\pi(y)/\\pi(x)) 1_{N(x)}(y) ,\n$$\nwhere $g$ is weight function satisfying $g(a) = ag(1/a)$ and $N(x)$ is a set of neighbors of $x$. \n\nThe main challenge addressed in the paper is that in many practical scenarios, computing $g\\left(\\frac{\\pi(y)}{\\pi(x)}\\right)$ can be either computationally expensive or intractable. To overcome this issue, the paper proposes a method that adapts the stochastic version of Langevin dynamics (Teh and Welling, 2011) to the discrete setting under consideration.\n\nTo achieve this adaptation, they develop a methodology for using biased estimators of the ratio $\\pi(y)/\\pi(x)$ through cache strategies and a discrete adaptation of the Polyak step size from optimization."

Toy examples would be valuable in understanding the limitations and biases introduced by the methods compared to exact MCMC algorithms, providing insight into the various approximations made by the authors in their methodology."

Am I right? If so, this point should be highlighted.\n- The statement of Proposition 4.1 lacks precision. I didn't understand what the authors mean by \"when the step size \u03f5 decreases to 0, the sampling process associated with the jump rate from Equation 12 is asymptotically unbiased.\"\n\nIn conclusion, while I believe the paper presents very interesting ideas, it's not ready for publication in its current state. The presentation appears more like a draft than a properly prepared submission."

The Wiener process in discrete steps is indexed with timestep and gradient looking into the future, summation over N and this is equation for $x_{t+h}$ depending on $x_{t+nh}$. I honestly can't make sense of it. I assume the authors made some honest typos there as were in a hurry with submission. Can you please explain/fix it as this is standard SGLD (and I assume that this is what authors wanted to write there).\n\n2. Likewise entire section 2 contains a lot of statements with under \"mild conditions\", \"easy to show\", \"asymptotically\" (in what sense). I'd like to see some references and examples what is meant by easy, mild and asymptotic, as for applications that concern Bayesian inference one might be interested in having guarantee of convergence up to p-th moment (which is also my question to the proposed method -- convergence that is asymptotic -- it is just in probability?), while what is easy to show under mild conditions is convergence in probability that is unaplicable to practical setups. Basically, some references are needed here.\n\n3. Appendix Equation 27. Should not there be minus sign before xWx as otherwise density is non-normalizable and henceforth this is not valid distribution?\n\n4. Propositon A.1 seems to be unapplicable to example in Section C.2. Generally, limitations of assumptions and their applicability to the examples is not shown.\n\n5. Out of curiosity, why this is called as SGDLD? This looks more like broader MCMC, whilst Langevin Dynamics is about stochastic differential equations (that are driven by some continious noise), while here it is justified by just showing that under certain conditions Kolmogorov equation gives invariant measure, however, this does look to me just some other form of MCMC rather than LD, as Kolmogorov equations are not about just LD. (nevertheless, this is interesting form of MCMC)"
