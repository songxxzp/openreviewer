First of all, the setting considered and the underlying ideas presented in the paper have already appeared in an earlier paper  (Akhtar et al., 2022) where authors have proposed SBFW. In SBFW, the authors consider a constrained stochastic bilevel problem and develop conditional gradient algorithms for solving the problem. Secondly, the authors of (Akhtar et al., 2022) have considered stochastic problems which are certainly more challenging than the deterministic setting considered in this work. I believe although the authors have shown dependence on condition number and removed the boundedness assumption on the partial gradient of $f$ w.r.t. $y$ (by using compactness of the constraint set) the major contributions may not be enough. In addition, the approximation of the product of Hessian inverse and partial gradient by solving a quadratic problem is quite popular in bilevel optimization and has already appeared in the AmIGO algorithm proposed in (Arbel et al ICLR 2022) and other papers. \n\n- Other than matrix completion and toy problems it would be interesting to see the performance of IBCG on large-scale machine learning problems. Will the algorithm be able to compete with stochastic algorithms in that case since the considered algorithm only works for the deterministic setting? \n\n\n**Minor**\n\n- Define $\\Omega_1$ and $\\Omega_2$ in equation (2).\n\n- The definition of training and test data before equation (3) is not clear. \n\n- What is $\\omega$ in the discussion before Section 3.1.\n \n- Please make sure that $\\mathcal{O}$ and  $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}$ are used consistently throughout the paper. \n\n- In the MAML problem are there algorithms that actually impose sparsity as shown in the formulation of equation (3)?"
