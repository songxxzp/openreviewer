A min-max objective mimicking this two-player game is optimized to estimate the inverse equilibrium using gradient descent ascent algorithm (and other variations of it). It is further proposed that for games that satisfy certain assumptions guaranteeing convex-concavity of the objective, the algorithm converges in a number of iterations that are polynomial in the precision of the obtained inverse equilibrium. This formulation is further extended to give algorithms for multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning and multi-agent apprenticeship learning, accompanied by polynomial time (and space) convergence guarantees under appropriate assumptions. Experiments are conducted to identify categories of games for which the method is effective, and whether its usefulness goes beyond provided theoretical limits."
