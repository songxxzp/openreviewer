The authors propose dual actor-critic to reconcile the problem: there are both conservative actor and optimistic actor, and an ensemble of critics used to compute the lower/upper bound of value estimates. The basic idea is to let actor acts optimistically while the other actor act is used for maximize lower bound of the Q values. The algorithm also adds some heuristic designs such as minimizing the KL divergence between the two actors, learning the optimism control parameter and the KL divergence weight. Empirical results are provided to show the effectiveness of the algorithm."

Currently the paper is written in a way that different updating rules are introduced; I expect to see a clear objective function (maybe with constraints) of Algorithm 1, so readers can easily see what it is optimizing, can the authors write it down in the rebuttal? \n\nWhen simultaneously maximizing both lower and upper bound of the Q values, would it squash all action values higher and still result in overestimation? \n\nempirically: \n1. Verify the proposed method indeed mitigate overestimation comparing with an algorithm without using any correction, e.g., compare the estimate value and MC estimation; the current version of the paper directly using evaluation return as a performance measure, which, I think lacks justification, as it is unclear where the improved performance results from; \n\n2. The added optimism is essentially an exploration strategy, some baselines aiming at exploration should be also compared. \n\n3. Ablation study should be provided to justify the following design choices: the effect of ensemble (and do those baselines use ensemble too?), the necessity of optimizing optimism and KL weight (can you use some intuitive choices instead of learning them)? \n\nAny comments how do you decide the order of the updating rules 10-15? And how their learning rates are chosen? \n\n4. The algorithm introduces many more hyper parameters comparing with commonly seen SAC or TD3 due to the added components in the losses, I would not consider the comparison to be fair with other baselines, unless evidence of similar efforts have been made to thoroughly sweep baseline\u2019s hyper-parameters is provided. \n\n5. Eq 7, how do you calculate the gradient w.r.t optimistic actor parameters, it appears the gradient should be also propagated through/to the first two Q functions and these Qs are interdependent with actor. \n\n6. The motivation of the paper is to avoid overestimation while keep good exploration. Isn\u2019t it quite intuitive to combine some exploration method with methods that mitigate overestimation?  it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to design such a baseline as mitigating overestimation typically require multiple critics and uncertainty estimate could be derived from the ensemble for exploration purpose. What is the proposed algorithm\u2019s advantage? \n\n7.
