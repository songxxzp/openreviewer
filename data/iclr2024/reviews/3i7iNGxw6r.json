The authors adopt a layer-wise context-masking method on GPTNeo and Bloom, discovering a \"task-recognition\" point in LLMs beyond which attending to the context is less significant. Further analysis reveals that finetuning layers around such a point are most effective and that layers after this point show higher redundancy."

It would be great to have experiments on other languages as well, such as En<->De.\n\nSecondly, the findings are only based on LLMs of one size, i.e. 3B. It's unclear whether readers could expect similar findings on other model sizes.\n\nBesides, based on Figure 1, retaining access to instructions pushes the task-recognition point to earlier layers. Does this also apply to prompt examples? For example, 5-shot prompting often outperforms 1-shot prompting. Can we get an early task recognition point by retaining access to 1 prompt example? If so, we might retain the 5-shot prompting performance but only attend to 1 example for most layers, indicating a high inference efficiency.\n\nLastly, the statement \"the most prunable heads occur after task recognition\" might be inadequate. In Figure 5, the head distribution for BLOOM is quite random."

I wanted to point out 3 biggest weaknesses to me - the presentation, the set-up and the conclusion.\n\n* The biggest weakness of the paper to me is that the presentation. I was very excited to read the work but later on I realize it is not that easy to follow the paper at all. I think the difficulty in following the work lies in several parts, to name a few as follows. First, the notations of \u2212, \u25e6, \u2022 as well as Instr\u2212Ex\u2212 are somewhat hard to follow and remember to me. I often have to go back and forth to understand this more. Second, there are difficult sentences/paragraphs (examples as below that I could not follow well). Third, I totally get lost at Figure 3 (what are instr_L1L2? what are instr_none?). Fourth, I have an issue with the section of 4.2, while this is nice \"Using the example of GPTNeo (32 layers), with a prompt size of 10, and lr = 20, the savings are approximately 35%.\", there is no detailed comparison of translation accuracy at all.\n\n\n* Context masking before a certain level of task- recognition results in a translation model that is often worse than the baseline which sees no instructions or examples. -> I have an issue with this sentence and I always want to take this chance to talk about my concern for the set-up. I consider this is not a surprising fact at all given that the prompt and translation examples appear BEFORE the input. Because of that masking them would obviously distort the representation of the input anyway. It maybe odd but I think the best set-up experiment for this is as follows:\nTranslate this input: input from english to french, given the following translation examples: ....\nI think with this set-up, masking the prompt (from english to french, given the following translation examples: ) and the examples (....) will NOT make that much impact to the translation.\n\n*\"Contrary to common fine-tuning wisdom, we show that fine-tuning of model layers is most beneficial in layers associated with task recognition, i.e. the middle layers of the model.\" -> I found this argument is very weak. The paper already mentions that \"Note that this setup is designed to tune the layers for task location. It is highly unlikely that the model can learn translation knowledge from this small amount of supervision\", so we cannot take results from such a set-up to say the above finding is correct.\n\n\nOther notes:\n* Interestingly, there is a strong inter-dependency amongst a sequence of layers, where masking out the context results in very poor task recognition. -> I really get lost at this sentence\n\n* Finally, we see that when instructions are masked with the examples (Instr\u2022Ex\u2022), model behavior closely follows that of models which do not receive instructions in their context at all (Instr\u2212Ex\u2022), suggesting that instructions are largely ignored when the examples are present. However, if the model is given complete access to instructions (Instr\u25e6Ex\u2022), it can use the intermediate processing of examples to achieve \"task recognition\" earlier. -> Somehow this paragraph is also not clear to me."

Use them and translate the following input\". In the case of different prompt, I was wondering if the specific layer where the plateaus appears (e.g. 20 for GPTNEO, 25 for BLOOM) will change?\n* Please elaborate more on Figure 3 about instr_none, intrst_l1l2"

Using GPTNEO2.7Band Bloom 3B for en <-> fr translation on FLORES, the authors explore combinations of instruction prompts and in-context examples and analyze model behavior by layer-from context masking. The authors find that 'task recognition' occurs in middle layers and that masking context earlier significantly disrupts model performance and access to instructions can encourage earlier task recognition. One implication is that increased efficiency can be achieved by masking context (avoiding computational overhead) starting at a certain layer. Additionally, LoRA fine-tuning applied to different layers showed that fine-tuning earlier-to-middle layers is more important than fine-tuning later layers.  The authors then apply the same masking strategy to attention heads, with inconclusive results."

                "value": "The paper exhibits certain limitations in its experimental approach, which consequently restrict the breadth of its conclusions. The exclusive reliance on the en-fr language pair raises concerns about potential biases. It remains unclear if the observed behavior would persist in en-sp or en-zh pairs or in direct transitions like fr-ge. By analyzing only two LLMs, both with a similar scale of 2.7B and 3B, the conclusions' applicability gets limited as well. This limitation becomes especially pertinent given that other studies, as acknowledged by the authors, like Wei et al. (2023) who suggest that In-Context Learning (ICL) procedure may be model size-dependent.\n\nThe paper's predominant focus on the attention mechanism during its ablation study might inadvertently introduce alternative explanations for task embedding, such as the potential for it to merely represent a semantic compression of input tokens. It is not clear which is the alternative research hypotheses to the task vector explanation and the found layer-wise behaviour. \nFor instance, one could have used a misleading instruction like 'write a summary in French', or 'plan how to solve the enumerated task in English'; or used several alternative instructions to perform the translation task, e.g. \"how can I say  '{{sentence}}' in French ?\", \"what is the English translation of \"{{sentence}}\" ? , ... etc. \n\nWhile Figure 1 and Figure 2 seem to display congruent patterns, it's challenging to reconcile them with Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3, in particular, is ambiguous;  the legend terms, like 'instr_L1L2' and 'instr_none', are not clearly defined. Similarly, the patterns oscillate and it is difficult to grasp conclusions w/o another task baseline finetuning.  Figure 4's alignment with the study's conclusions is also complicated due to the presence of layers exhibiting unexpected behavior. the main difference with Figure 1 is that  attention is limited to all other tokens, including the partial decoding and the input to translate. Maybe another interesting experiment is to mask attention from all input (not only instructions and examples), this could help understand this picture better or at least it will help to get a better hypotheses of why masking some initial layers. It might be that the task layers are simply compressing the input similarly to an encoder-decoder architecture and then the upper layers are simply decoding for which incrementally refining the hypotheses can provide limited gains. \n\nRegarding  the L0 regularization optimization, there might be several masks that can lead to similar solutions with different patterns. It would have been nice to see what happens if one biases the L0 masking loss towards both the \"task identification layers\" and the non-relevant layers. This modification would have been a stronger evidence towards the conclusion. \n\nAdditionally, conducting analogous experiments in other domains, such as summarization, would undoubtedly offer a more comprehensive perspective specially for figure 1 and figure 2. \n\nLastly, the use of \"Instr-Ex*\" nomenclature was frequently perplexing, especially when it often seems synonymous or expandable in the same manner as 'instr_L1L2'."
