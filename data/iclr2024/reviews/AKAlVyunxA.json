                "value": "The paper proposes an explanation-based approach to defend against backdoor attacks in deep reinforcement learning. The main observation is that a backdoor attack aims to cause an RL agent to fail a game or get a very low total reward, which can be explained using the triggers present in the environment. To this end, the paper applies the self-explainable framework of Guo et al., 2021b, called EDGE, to identify a set of time steps where triggers are most likely to present and then extract a set of features from the state vector of these time steps and treat their average as triggers. The paper applies their approach to detect both perturbation-based backdoor attacks in single and multi-agent settings, where triggers are injected into states, and adversarial agent attacks, where a sequence of actions serves as triggers. It further proposes a backdoor shielding method to retrain the agent in the operating environment. The approach is evaluated using Atari games and the SMC environment for perturbation-based attacks and the MuJoCo environments for adversarial agent attacks."

                "value": "Although various explanation-based defenses have been proposed for protecting deep learning, applying policy explanation techniques to protect RL agents from backdoor attacks seems new and promising. The approach does not require access to a clean environment or a set of clean trajectories. \n\nThe proposed approach applies to both perturbation-based attacks and adversarial agent attacks, outperforms several baselines in the former case, and obtains reasonable performance in the latter under some simple backdoor attacks against RL."

                "value": "The paper is a direct application of the self-explainable framework for RL in Guo et al., 2021b, where the framework has already been applied to identify critical time steps associated with adversarial agent attacks. The technical contribution seems limited. \n\nThe proposed method relies on reward signals in the actual environment in its explanation component, which requires many failure trajectories to identify triggers. Hence, it is not applicable in security-critical domains.\n\nI am not convinced that the approach can work in more challenging settings. To identify critical time steps associated with triggers using the EDGE framework, two assumptions are needed. First, there is a set of failure trajectories available. Second, the agent is supposed to win the game if the triggers are removed. However, a successful attack does not necessarily lead to a clear failure, especially in the case of stealthy attacks, where the goal could be reducing the agent's reward. Without domain knowledge of the expected performance of the agent in the target environment, it is hard to define what is considered a failure. Further, the evaluation considers a backdoor attack with a single fixed trigger placed at a fixed location, which is rather limited."

            "questions": {
                "value": "How is (4) solved? Algorithm 1 only shows how to estimate the constraint but not how the shielding policy is optimized. \n\nHow are the set of trajectories used to train SHINE generated in the experiments? Are these all known to be failures? \n\nThe trigger detection stage of SHINE takes 12 hours, with an additional 5 hours used to retrain the policy. Is this comparable with other baselines? Since the approach requires many interactions with an infected environment, the agent will suffer from a significant loss until the trigger is mitigated. Hence, it seems unfair to only consider the reward after retraining when comparing the approach with other baselines. \n\nGuo et al., 2021b show that significant improvement can already be achieved by partially blinding the victim agent's observation at the critical time steps in losing episodes. Thus, it would help to have an ablation study demonstrating the advantage of feature-level explanation and policy retraining.  \n\nIn the experiment, it is assumed that there is a trigger in the environment with a probability of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3. I wonder what would happen if triggers were present most of the time.  \n\nThe evaluation uses a single fixed trigger pattern across RL training and testing. I wonder what would happen if the attacker varies the trigger used over rounds/episodes. \n\nTable 2 shows that SHINE performs better than the original PPO in a clean environment. Why is this the case?"

Without any assumption, it may happen that the adversary may not attack when the algorithm is run. Does the algorithm still work?\n    \n4. As a case study, let say the adversary designs a patch trigger to be put on top right corner of the state image(say in ping pong game). Normally, the pixel value is uniformly 100 and the adversary has trained the policy so that when pixel value is 255 or 0, it takes backdoor action. While attacking the adversary only inject 255 pixel patch. Your method of simply deleting the feature would lead to a zero patch which is adversarial as well. How would you fix this?"
