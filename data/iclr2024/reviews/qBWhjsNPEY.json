In addition, the authors propose to reuse the layerwise features before the perturbed parameter's model layer, and parallelize the forward computation in multiple processes. \n\n(2) the authors propose the ZO-GraSP algorithm that uses ZO to estimate Hessian-gradient product for each parameter for the GraSP algorithm, and select a subset of parameters to perform the ZO update with CGE. \n\nThe authors perform experiments on ResNet-20 (and 8-layer CNN) on CIFAR10, black-box defense against adversarial attacks with DnCNN and ResNet-50 on ImageNet-10, and corrective NN with iterative PDE solver for simulating unsteady wake flow. In the image classification task, the authors also perform comprehensive scaling experiments with different sparsity ratio, parameter size, dataset size, batch size, and number of GPUs, and demonstrate the performance and scalability of deepzero framework."

This method is also tailored to CGE instead of RGE as RGE would perturb all layers, and therefore change the intermediate features of all layers per each query. \n\nChoosing a sparse set of indices to perform ZO update would be computationally-efficient to the ZO-CGE method. I also believe the DeepZero could be more general than only the ZO-GraSP method. In this case, DeepZero could be a general framework for training deep models with ZO from scratch. \n\nThe scaling experiments in the image-classification task are quite comprehensive."

This issue could be fatal as if we have a model with more than 1 million parameters, DeepZero will still take significant wall-clock time to pretrain even under 90% sparsity (in fact, it already takes 28 hrs with 12k parameters in Figure 3).\n\n- An ablation study missing in this paper is to show the performance of RGE versus the number of queries. We should expect such curve to plateau quickly, and still below the performance of CGE across multiple tasks to show the competitiveness of CGE. Ideally, this comparison should be done across models and tasks, as the statement on the advantage of CGE over RGE when $q$ = $d$ is quite strong and we will need a strong evidence to justify this argument.\n\n- The authors claim the idea of \"forward parallelization\" for ZO-CGE as the novelty of this paper. Prior research (e.g. the last sentence of section 3 in Ruan et al., 2019; the second paragraph of section 1.2 in Cai et al. 2021) have indicated that the gradient estimator of ZO (both CGE and RGE) is parallelizable. However, I did not find any prior literature indicating the intermediate feature reuse of CGE, and I would accept this novelty claim at this moment.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n- Ruan, Yangjun, et al. \"Learning to Learn by Zeroth-Order Oracle.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2019.\n\n- Cai, HanQin, et al. \"A zeroth-order block coordinate descent algorithm for huge-scale black-box optimization.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

The description of their approach is clear, and the paper is easy to follow."

If CGE is used with a small enough mu, the gradient should match that of backprop, so it is obvious that the accuracy will match that of first order methods as shown in Figure 2. If the goal of this comparison is to show the effect of sparsification and approximation errors in the finite difference, the authors should perform a thorough ablation study for the values of mu, q, and the sparsity ratio. Otherwise, I recommend removing the experiments on differentiable networks, since the aim of this paper is not to show how zeroth-order methods compare to first-order methods for differentiable problems. Having this comparison at the beginning of the experiments section may lead the readers to think about this comparison and get distracted from the true message of this paper."

            "questions": {
                "value": "I don't quite understand the rationale behind the comparison of CGE vs. RGE for q=d. Random sampling is a compromise you make when an exhaustive search of the whole space (q=d) is prohibitive. It is obvious that CGE would be better if you can afford to sample the whole space with orthogonal directions (e_i). It is also obvious why RGE is less efficient when q=d. Since the random vectors (u_i) are not orthogonal, the samples are not independent. The real question is how you can increase the accuracy   of estimating the gradient when q << d.\n\nIn the experiments the smoothing function mu is set to 5e-3, which seems fairly large. Since the gradient is exact at the limit of mu -> 0, it would seem like a smaller value would be better. How was this value chosen, and what is the motivation for not using a smaller value?\n\nIf I understand correctly, both the \u201cblack-box defense against adversarial attacks\u201d and \u201csimulation-coupled DL for discretized PDE error correction\u201d involve deep neural networks where part of the forward function is non-differentiable. If so, would it be possible to use finite difference just for the part that is non-differentiable, while using automatic differentiation for the modules that are differentiable? Theoretically, you just need to compute one of the chained Jacobians during backprop for the non-differentiable part using finite difference. I know such an implementation would be practically very painful, but if you could limit the number of parameters that you need to differentiate with finite difference it would result in a much larger reduction than pruning the whole network with GraSP."

The paper presents a well-constructed framework introducing a sparsity-induced, BP-free optimization method for ML tasks that lack explicit first-order information, such as  black-box prompt learning and adversarial attack and defense. The method adeptly balances query efficiency and training effectiveness, outperforming existing techniques while also extending the scalability of zeroth-order optimization."

This improvement would fortify the paper's pivotal contribution, ensuring its effective delivery to the audience.\n\n  -[2] In the paper, the introduction of improved inductive biases for ZO deep model training is mentioned, and the authors may need to carefully balance to ensure that these biases do not overly constrain the model's generalization performance. This may involve appropriately controlling the strength of inductive biases during model training to strike a balance between performance on specific tasks and generalization. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of inductive biases in the context of specific application scenarios and tasks is crucial."
