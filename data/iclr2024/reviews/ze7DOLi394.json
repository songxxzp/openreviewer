The learnt features in a trained model are defined as the principal components of the last layer's activations, and the proposed interaction tensor examines these feature representations of a dataset for a set of models. The interaction tensor is used to empirically validate several common-sense intuitions, such as feature distribution being long-tailed, which then leads to a further abstracted framework for combinatorial-style analysis. This framework is able to theoretically demonstrate empirical phenomena from the observations as well as prior works such as GDE."

However, I think the model proposed in this paper is too simplistic. The implicit biases of deep learning are core to some of the merging phenomenon that we see these days and the models that the authors propose fails to capture that. I also think that a good toy model should leave the door open to generalizations and getting closer to real world practice (for example, for the random features model of deep learning, there is a very obvious way to move towards making it more realistic). But the models that the authors propose is too abstract and it is not clear what simplifications are made to the real problem to arrive at the proposed model.\n\n- Although the model is based on some observations using the interaction tensor, I still find the model to be not very well motivated. Any insights on how this can relate to the training of deep nets?\n\n- It is not very clear how the authors set the hyperparameters in their model (e.g., the thresholds).\n\n- The notations are a bit confusing (i, j, k, etc.). I suggest authors avoid using these generic letters. Also, the paper will benefit greatly from a figure that summarizes all the notations (p_d, p_r, etc.). It will also help explain the method.\n\n- The authors \"prove\" GDE in their model without the explicit assumption of calibration. But the model is very abstract/high-level and I'm not sure if the assumptions that they make are stronger or weaker than calibration.\n\n- The theoretical understanding of feature learning is not as rudimentary as the authors claim.
