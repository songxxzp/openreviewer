This method addresses the challenge of adversarial modes encountered in the optimization process, improving design performance. By employing a compositional design system, the paper illustrates the potential to merge multiple diffusion models representing different subsystems, enhancing the complexity and specificity of the design.  The introduced Compositional Inverse Design with Diffusion Models (CinDM) method is highlighted for its capability to address out-of-distribution and more intricate design inputs beyond the training data, demonstrating promising advancements in the field of inverse design."
