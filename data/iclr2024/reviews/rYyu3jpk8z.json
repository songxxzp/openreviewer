Second, the discriminative CDM emphasizes calculating the probability of sequence generation using a contrastive approach. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the generative and discriminative CDM when comparing to several baseline methods."

Specifically:\n- For the generative CDM, there's no direct comparison with the expert/amateur model employed solely for constructing negative samples.\n- For the discriminative CDM, a direct comparison is missing where the expert model is used to compute the generation score.\n\nThese baselines are essential for establishing the paper's originality (applying the contrastive decoding idea into text generation evaluation) and shouldn't be omitted.\n\n**Limitations**: \nThe paper acknowledges some limitations in Appendix A.3. Additionally, I'm concerned regarding the method's applicability in two trends of open-domain generation evaluation:\n   - **Fine-grained Evaluation**:  This is the case where users arbitrarily set the evaluation perspective. It's unclear if the negative sample creation strategy can consistently control construction towards a specific aspect.\n   - **Holistic Evaluation**: This involves comparing generated outputs to a given input and assigning ranks. Given that the paper mentions that state-of-the-art Language Models like LLAMA-1/2 7b are too strong to act as amateur models, it suggests the approach is best suited for weaker models. This raises the question: can it effectively evaluate outputs from more advanced models? This potential constraint could limit its applicability."

The idea presented in the paper is highly influenced from the contrastive decoding (Li et al. 2022) where the model tries to decode a sequence maximizing the contrastive momentum: m(s) = log p_expert(s) - log p_amateur(s). It builds on the partial order assumption that  the model with a larger number of parameters (expert) performs better than the smaller one (amateur), in the same model family. The paper explores two ways to use contrastive momentum for text evaluation: 1) generative CDM: the constravie momentum is used to generate negative examples by perturbing positive examples and then a discriminator is trained to separate positive examples from negative examples, and 2) discriminative CDM: estimated as the sum of the contrastive momentum at each time step. \n\nThe experiments are done with multi-turn dialog (focusing on overall and coherence quality) and summarization (focusing on factuality) evaluations.  Discriminative CDM seems to perform better than the Generative CDM approaches on both tasks.\n\nThe paper is very interesting to read until the experiment section. The experiments and results section could have been better to strengthen their conclusions regarding their proposed methods for text evals."

What about other dimensions: for example, Coherence,  Factuality,  Fluency,  Informativeness? It would have been nice to see how CDM does on various aspects. Also the comparison is limited to very few other metrics. Please see https://openreview.net/forum?id=OIe3kpwl40D for a better experimental setup.\n\nThe captions in Table 1 and Table 4 are not very clear.

                "value": "1. The method design of negative sample generation seems not to make sense for me. It is commonly known that high-quality negative samples may promote the performance of discriminators. Even if low-quality samples are needed, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 also have the ability to generate texts with controlled qualities via prompt design. Thus, I\u2019m curious about the necessity to train a model on task-specific data to construct negative samples, which may degrade the generalization ability of the proposed method.\n\n2. The baselines used in the experiment are somewhat outdated with the rapid development of LLM-based evaluation metrics. Since the authors have already cited two representative works including UNIEVAL [1] and G-EVAL [2] in the introduction and claim that they have limitations, these two methods should be surely added to the baselines for direct comparison.\n\n3. The experimental analysis in this paper is too rough and needs to be largely improved. I even don\u2019t find the analysis on important ablation studies in the main content.\n\n[1] Towards a Unified Multi-Dimensional Evaluator for Text Generation.
