To achieve a logarithmic regret bound, it is common to deploy Newton-type method for OKL, but second-order methods are usually computationally inefficient. This paper attempts to address the issue by using sketching and better algorithms. To this end, they provide an algorithm with update time $O(Bk+k^2)$, when $k$ is small this is a strict improvement from prior works that rely on computing the Newton direction exactly. They also conduct extensive experiments to show that the proposed method is faster than other second-order methods and has a better error rate than first-order methods."

                "value": "This paper considers kernel learning in the online setting. The main goal is to give an algorithm with logarithmic regret that is also efficient. It is well known that online gradient descent based methods only achieve square root regret, while exact second order optimization methods achieve logarithmic regret. Thus,  the paper proposes a new approximate second order method, which approximates the kernel matrix at any time step using an online variant of CUR Decomposition/Nystrom approximation, proposed by Wang et al. 2016. This method is similar to others that have been proposed in the literature that use Nystrom based kernel matrix approximation to speed up second second order online kernel learning.\n\nNaively, applying this Nystrom decomposition method requires time roughly s^3 per iteration where s is the number of landmark points sampled. This is due to having to perform a truncated SVD of an s x s sampled matrix to reduce it to some rank k < s.  To address this, the paper proposes an incremental SVD approach which improves the s^3 runtime to O(sk+k^3).\n\nThe paper provides a regret analysis for their approach, as well as experiments. The paper also claims that the proposed algorithm is more robust in adversarial settings than existing approaches. However, it was unclear to me why this was \u2014 given that the algorithm largely follows the same blueprint as related prior work. No guarantees on robustness are given.\n\nI have two related major concerns about the presented results.\n\n1. The relationship between the proposed truncated incremental SVD (TISVD), (which seems to be the main algorithmic contribution of the work) and existing work on incremental SVD was unclear to me. Existing work on incremental SVD updates the SVD of a s x s rank-k matrix with a constant rank update in O(sk+k^3) time. Once this update is performed, the matrix may no-longer be rank-k. However, one can trivially truncate the new SVD back to rank-k if desired. This seems to be the only difference proposed by TISVD? It would be helpful if the authors could explain why the given O(sk+k^3) runtime then just doesn\u2019t directly follow from existing work on Incremental SVD. There is an extensive discussion in appendix D, but it is not clear and does not address my question above.\n\n2. Of course, truncating the SVD after each low-rank update, as is done in this paper has a cost. It means that after all the updates have been performed the output *is not* equivalent to just performing a truncated SVD on the sum of updates. Consider a simple example where I have a diagonal 2 x 2 matrix A. And rank parameter k = 1. Then say initially A_1,1 = 1, A_2,2 = 0. My rank-1 approximation to A (i.e. truncated rank-1 SVD) will be [1,0,0,0]. Now say I repeatedly make rank-1 updates where I increment A_2,2 by .5. Then every time I make a rank-1 update and then truncate back to rank-1, I will truncate A back to [1,0,0,0]. This will be a very poor approximation to my matrix, which after t updates will have A_11 = 1 and A_22 = t/2. \n\nThis issue is known in the literature. For example, it is addressed by work on Frequent Directions sketching \u2014 see https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01711, which performs a different type of truncation that prevent losing large weight of accumulated updates.\n\nCritically, the main regret bound of the paper Theorem 1, must depend then on some sort of accuracy guarantee for TISVD, since the algorithm it applies to uses TISVD. However, if one inspects the proof of Theorem 1, there is no mention of TISVD. From what I understand, it is simply assumed that TISVD does in fact output an optimal rank-k approximation to the accumulated updates (I believe specifically in equation (16)).\n\nIt would be very helpful if the authors could address the above concerns during the author response period and correct me if I am mistaken."

Why does OGD only use a linear combination of the feature vectors? This is only if the gradient is a linear combination of these vectors right? It would depend on the function being optimized no? OGD could be applied to highly non-linear models, such as neural networks. Are you focusing specifically in linear regression and kernel ridge regression here? It is unclear.\n-** In the discussion of the work of Calandriello et al. it says \u2018rendering a significant cost of updates\u2019. I didn\u2019t follow this? Why is this? Isn\u2019t the goal of that line of work exactly to make the cost scale linearly in the number of data points seen?\n-** In abstract and intro it is not clear what \u2018the budget\u2019 is. Relatedly I don\u2019t understand why the work of Calandriello has a quadratic scaling. Can this be made more concrete?\n- In the problem set up, can what class does f_t come from? Presumably it can\u2019t be just and function mapping inputs to labels. Are you assuming that it is linear in the RKHS?\n-** In the classic Nystrom method of Williams and Seeger, the approximation of the for KS(S^TKS)^+ S^K where S is a sampling matrix. I.e. U = (S^TKS)^+. See equation (10) in Williams and Seeger. U is very efficient to compute since S^T K S is just a small principal submatrix of the kernel matrix. Further, this approximation is optimal in the trace norm.\n- From what I can tell the approach described in (1), which optimizes U in the Frobenius norm, was not discussed in the Williams and Seeger paper, and is much more computationally expensive as it requires computing (KS)^+. Why is this variant being considered? Why does classic Nystrom not suffice? The approach of (2) seems reasonable, but why use it over classic Nystrom? Is it more accurate in some settings? Some justification needs to be given here.\n-** Why in 5 are you using a rank k SVD. Is the goal to further reduce dimension? If so, why?  Again \u2014 this needs to be justified as this seems to be a key computational step tackled by the presented approach.\n- Incremental SVD algorithms/algorithms for SVD with low-rank updates are widely studied. See e.g. https://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2006-059.pdf. More work should be cited here and a more clear comparison made.\n- The discussion of the randomized SVD in Appendix D might be inaccurate?. Assuming you are maintaining a reduced rank-k SVD of the s x s matrix, then this matrix can be multiplied by in O(s*k) time, not O(s^2) time. By multiplying by each factor sequentially. Thus, the runtime here I believe should be O(s*k^2+k^3).\n- In Theorem 1, the coherence is undefined. This has multiple different definitions in the literature so needs to be defined.\n-** Table 1 doesn\u2019t make sense to me. If one wants to achieve a faster algorithm, why not just set B = 0. Or just design an algorithm that actually looks at just a small fraction of the budget, giving any runtime desirable. In order for this table to sensical, there must be some notion of how the budget and the regret bound relate. Also as mentioned earlier \u2014 the term \u2018budget\u2019 is never defined. It is not clear what it means."

This trick is used in association with second order corrections of the weight w_t. The contribution is simple to understand when reading appendix C and it nicely completes the literature. A regret analysis is developed with an assumption about directional curvature of the  Lipchitz continuous loss (no strong convexity is required) additionally to classic assumptions about polynomial weight decay of the base kernel. Experimental results include comparisons between this algorithm and competitors with fixed budget (nb of streaming data with non-zero loss for which corrections have to be made). Moreover, FORK is also empirically shown to be robust against adversarial attacks."

I assume that the event on which the probability is computed should be $\\|  B_iA_i  - B_I S_p S_p^T A_i \\|^2 > Constant \\| A_i \\|^2 \\|B_I \\|^2$ with the right notations..."

I did not catch why the algorithm should be robust to such attacks. Is a theoretical guarantee is reachable ? \n- finally, overcoming concept drifting is also a claim of the paper but I don't really see a discussion about that."
