Such methods have limitations when the behavior policy is sub-optimal. The paper proposes to overcome this drawback by constructing an optimal supported dataset, which can then be used for offline learning via classical regularization-based methods.\n\nThe paper starts from the linear programming formulation for MDPs, with the density ratio being a variable. After learning the optimal density ratio, the original dataset can be reweighted. The problem is that a minimax problem is computationally hard to solve. Thus this paper introduces a relaxation and reduces the problem into a single minimization problem. \n\nFurthermore, optimality guarantee is given thanks to the MLE of the transition model and convexity of the objective function brought by an added squared regularization term. Experimental results on RL benchmark D4RL confirms the efficacy of the proposed method."

                "value": "The author introduces a method for reweighting datasets to optimize the behavior policy in behavior-regularized offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) for enhanced performance. The effectiveness of behavior-regularized offline RL algorithms is contingent on the behavior policy that accumulates the dataset. A prevalence of low-return trajectories in the behavior policy\u2019s collected data results in diminished performance of the offline RL algorithms. The proposed method modifies the behavior policy by adjusting the dataset weights, employing the density importance correction estimation (DiCE) technique to optimize these weights, thereby enhancing the performance of the behavior policy. Experimental outcomes indicate performance enhancements in several D4RL offline RL datasets."

                "value": "- Lack of baselines and related works discussion. Re-weighting offline RL training objectives or optimizing the dataset has been studied in prior works [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, the author didn't discuss and compare with them. Without comparing with these works, it would be difficult to answer the significance of this work.\n- Implementation details of the baselines are not presented. The results of Table 1 look pretty similar to the official codebase of AW/RW. However, it should be noted that the official codebase of AW/RW uses offline RL hyperparameters (e.g., the regularization weight of CQL) different than Sun 2023. It's necessary to set those offline RL's hyperparameters to be the same for fair comparison. It'd be great if the author can upload their baseline implementation and scripts to reproduce experiments.\n- Hyperparameter search results of baselines are not presented even though the author claims that the baselines' hyperparameters are also optimized.\n- The baseline scores in Table 1 don't have a standard deviation.\n- Performance improvement is limited, except for maze2d. From Table 1, OSD doesn't show a significant performance gain in MuJoCo tasks. Checking Lee et al. (2021), we see that their method also performs the best in maze2d but underperforms or match the baselines in others. But, the author doesn't compare Lee et al. (2021) in Table 1, which makes the contribution of OSD-RL unclear.\n- OSD-RL requires training two additional models, which increases the run time. The author should compare the run time (wallclock time) with the baselines. For this method to be impactful, the increased runtime should be proportional to their performance gain.\n\n[1] Wu, Yue, et al. \"Uncertainty weighted actor-critic for offline reinforcement learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.08140 (2021).\n\n[2] Chen, Xinyue, et al. \"Bail: Best-action imitation learning for batch deep reinforcement learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 18353-18363.\n\n[3] Xu H, Jiang L, Li J, et al.
