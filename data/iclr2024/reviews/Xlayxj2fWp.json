While it is in general quite pressing to understand the structure of GPT/LLM, and the authors indeed made some interesting observations, they seem to be quite explicit that they do not care about the execution quality. For example, Delta should be lower bounded but not upper bounded in order to justify using KL divergence/Total variations (smells like a doable fix to provide the other side of inequality; I dont know). In general there is a feeling that the problem is not studied thoroughly.  IMO, another major limitation is that if we dont know which model is used to generate the text. In general, one is most interested in determining whether a block of text is from some LLM, not a specific collection of 5-10 widely available models.\n\n-----\nupdated: \n\nI read the rebuttal that clarifies my misunderstanding. The current logic in the paper flows as \"let's introduce llh gap, then llh gap implies KL large, then let's forget about KL because it is hard to compute/estimate and go back to llh gap\"; some text in rebuttal appears to be more clear to me. \n\nAlso, it would be helpful to discuss more on why KL estimation is harder than llh gap (as both are effectively relating human and machine distributions) like llh requires smaller sample from human. Nevertheless, I think in general the paper is above iclr bar."

The method involves truncating the text and feeding the second half to an LLM and analysing the parts through an N-gram analysis. The paper addresses both black-box (probability distribution of LLMs is not known) as well as white-box models (probability distribution is known). The paper shows that the proposed method surpasses SOA performance in distinguishing between machine and human-generated text by evaluating on a number of proprietary (e.g. GPT3+) and open-source(LLAMA, GPT-NeoX) models, on both English and German datasets. The performance is based on the finding that the distribution of machine-generated text and human-generated text are different when given a preceding text. The proposed method also provides explanation and evidence for the prediction, can handle model sourcing and revised text attacks."
