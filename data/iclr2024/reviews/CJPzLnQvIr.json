The method is incremental to (Zhao et al., 2021), adapting it to the federated setting with many clients. This method reuses the gradient updates produced during FL training for DD, so the overhead of creating distilled datasets is very small. However, the result quality is not as good as the more expensive baselines, but finetuning steps on the original dataset can mitigate this issue to achieve comparable accuracy."

This specialized technique, known as Federated Unlearning (FU), is the central objective of the study.\n\nTo achieve this, the authors introduce an innovative and highly efficient FU methodology named QUICKDROP. QUICKDROP leverages the power of Dataset Distillation (DD) to streamline the unlearning process, resulting in a significant reduction in the computational resources required when compared to conventional approaches. The fundamental principle of QUICKDROP involves each client generating a concise and representative dataset referred to as a \"distilled dataset\" using DD techniques. These distilled datasets play a crucial role in the subsequent unlearning phase.\n\nFurthermore, the authors demonstrate their ingenuity by seamlessly integrating Dataset Distillation (DD) into the Federated Learning (FL) training process. This integration enhances the overall efficiency of QUICKDROP by capitalizing on the reuse of gradient updates generated during FL training for DD purposes. Consequently, the overhead associated with creating distilled datasets is effectively minimized.\n\nThe empirical evaluation of QUICKDROP's performance, conducted across three standard datasets, conclusively demonstrates its capacity to deliver remarkable efficiency gains in the context of federated unlearning."

While the findings indicate a significant improvement in efficiency, there are concerns about the effectiveness of the method, particularly in terms of accuracy. Sacrificing effectiveness for increased efficiency may not be a favorable trade-off in practical applications.\n\nThe organization of the paper could benefit from improvement.
