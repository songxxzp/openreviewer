How the proposed model will change accordingly?\n  - For example, one big file needs to replace a few small files and thus the action will change (action will no longer be binary but rather will need to span a few entries in the action matrix and hence the action will be very hard (combinatorial problem) - which video files to evacuate in order to place the new big file)\n- Reward seems to be designed to only capture the local reward and no global term. How to ensure consensus in terms of convergence? No convergence analysis is provided.\n- Scalability and scaling the algorithm to cover the more general form of different file sizes and servers differences will make the state space and action space (NP Hard, comb. problem) very large and thus very complex to solve. \n- Each EBS serves a distinct region (no overlap, as per the paper) and optimizing each EBS individually should be sufficed in my opinion. How sharing among servers will help here?\n- How is the three defined temporal metrics related to video file arrival rate?. Why not adopting arrival rate instead since it is widely used and correlate/encapsulate at least two of these three metrics?"

This paper conducted a measurement study and revealed that the primary factor influencing caching performance is the spatio-temporal diversities in request patterns. To tackle the issue of sparse requests in specific Edge Base Stations (EBSs), the paper proposes to use knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from request-dense EBSs to request-sparse ones. To further account for the spatio-temporal drift in request distribution across EBSs, the paper designs an adaptive KD-based cross-domain collaborative edge caching framework, named KDCdCEC. The proposed framework consists of three major components: 1) a RL agent to make caching replacement decisions in each EBS; 2) a deep deterministic policy gradient-based algorithm to adaptively configure the reference weights for adaptive KD; 3) a content-aware request routing mechanism. Experiment results shows the effectiveness of KDCdCEC under a specific caching setting."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The problem statement or definition of collaborative edge caching in this paper lacks clarity and support.\n1) The paper assumes that the EBSs collaborate by sharing caching policies rather than cached content. This assumption gives rise to two problems. Firstly, considering that each EBS has limited cache storage, if they don't share cached content among themselves, every cache miss would necessitate content retrieval from remote CDN servers. Consequently, the potential benefits of collaborative edge caching are constrained since it doesn't significantly reduce backbone traffic. Secondly, the paper also highlights the spatial drift and diversity of request patterns in different EBS domains. This raises a question about the rationale behind advocating the sharing of caching policies among EBSs. For example, if one EBS serves requests with a LRU pattern, while another EBS caters to a LFU pattern, how would these two EBSs benefit from sharing caching policies when their request patterns differ?\n2) This paper studies a caching problem with a fixed number of video contents, which significantly deviates from real caching systems where the number of videos or objects varies over time. Furthermore, the paper assumes the CDN server have cached all the videos. However, considering the substantial number of videos (i.e., 2.887 million) mentioned in the evaluation section, this assumption might be overly stringent, as CDNs typically have relatively limited storage capacity.\n2. The presentation of the proposed framework in the paper lacks clarity, and certain claims about the techniques are not well substantiated.\n1) The paper claims that the RL agent is slot-wise and can adapt to EBSs with different storage sizes. However, it's noted that the action space of the RL agent is C \\times C, where C seems a fixed number across all EBSs throughout the paper (including the evaluation section). If C does indeed differ among EBSs, then during knowledge distillation, how do you handle the variable input state size, which is 2C \\times F?\n2) What is the content-aware request routing mechanism? I did not find any technique description about it.\n3) The paper uses the names and notations interchangeably, which leads to confusion regarding the number of neural networks within the proposed framework, their specific functions, and how they are trained, particularly in the case of the popularity network.\n4) What is the ration behind the design of the reward in Equation 1? As the reward is determined by consecutive cache misses to the same cache slot, if that cache slot stores a popular video, the delay of reward for the popular video is much longer than the delay of reward in the situation of storing an unpopular video at the slot. This further indicates that the training data (i..e, the transition tuple (s, a, \\tao, s\u2019)) can be potentially imbalanced. \n5) How does the reference weight agent adapt to dynamic partner lists? If two EBSs are no longer pattern, it seems the corresponding action network parameter in the reference weight agent should be zero. Then, how do you enforce this when training the reference weight agent?\n6) it is unclear how the proposed framework update reference partner list.\n7) The training location and process of the RL agents and neural networks are not detailed in the paper, and additional information is not provided. For example, what is the training convergence speed and time of the RL agents? What is the size of training data for different EBS domain. This is important as the edge server often has limited computation and storage resources. \n3. The paper's evaluation results are not sufficiently robust or convincing. What is the reason to choose a cache size of 32? The caching size should be related to the total active video content number. Besides, the proposed framework should be evaluated on various caching size setting.\n4.
