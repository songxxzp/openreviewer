Different from the original EM methods like (Zheng et al. 2018), this paper 1) introduces and learns an additional variable to model regime participation, and 2) allows nonlinear relationships by using neural networks like that in (Brouillard et al. 2020, Liu & Kuang 2023). The performance is validated on simulated and real-world datasets."

                "value": "1. **The significance of the problem setting is unclear:**\n   - It seems unnatural to assume that the time series data is from several mixed unknown regimes while within each regime the temporal causal relations are stationary. Could the authors give some motivative or real-world examples of this kind of datasets?\n   - Usually it's more natural to think of nonstationarity in time series data as changing constantly but gradually, i.e., in the context of this paper, the regime partition is as fine as each single time stamp, while the causal relations (densities, edges weights) change smoothly across different time stamps.\n   - Specifically, in this paper, by \"time partition\" (Definition 2), did the authors assume that each partition is a continent time series block? If yes, it should be stated clearly, instead of a vague \"time partition\"; if no, why, and any motivations? Also, did the authors assume/constrain any \"similarities\" between the causal graphs of different regimes?\n\n2. **Even under this setting, the problem can already be well solved by existing methods:**\n   - This paper mentions CD-NOD (Huang et al. 2020) but claims that \"CD-NOD cannot infer individual causal graphs and necessitates prior knowledge about the number of regimes.\" But based upon my understanding on CD-NOD, this statement is generally incorrect, and the regime partition is actually readily obtainable from CD-NOD's abstract output.\n   - By using the time stamp IDs as the surrogate variable, CD-NOD's phases I and II can output the abstract causal graph where the parents of each variable is identified as the union of all its parents in graphs from different regimes. Then, note that there is a phase III, kernel non-stationary visualization (Fig 12), which generally estimates the variability of the conditional distribution $p(Xi | union.parents(Xi))$ over the time index surrogate. The different regime partition is then readily available, i.e., the locations/times where changes happen are detected. Finally, with regimes recovered, any methods like PCMCI can be used in each stationary regime to obtain the graphs of each.\n   - So what's the benefit of using the authors' proposed method than just using CD-NOD as above? Or please correct me if I am wrong regarding my understanding on CD-NOD or the problem.\n\n3. **The parametric assumption is quite limited:**\n   - The authors categorize the proposed CASTOR as score-based methods. Just for the convention, I would suggest to specify it as optimization-based methods (e.g., NOTEARS), to be distinguished from those real score-based methods, like GES.\n   - Just like many existing optimization-based methods, this paper assume that the exogenous noise in the additive noise model follows a standard Gaussian distribution (namely, the uni/equal-variance assumption). This, however, is generally untestable and highly impractical in real-world scenarios. When the equal-variance assumption is violated, these optimization-based methods can perform relatively bad.\n   - In this paper, is there any way to relax the uni/equal-variance assumption?\n\n4. **The experimental comparisons are incomplete:**\n   - The authors only provide experimental comparisons with stationary temporal causal discovery methods PWGC, VARLiNGAM, and DYNOTEARS. Moreover, the VARLiNGAM method is also misspecified for the non-Gaussian distributions.\n   - More comprehensive comparisons are needed with at least some non-stationary temporal causal discovery methods, as well as the CD-NOD one discussed above.\n\n5. **The presentation somewhat lacks clarity.**\n   - What is the mixing coefficients $\\pi_{t,u}(\\alpha)$ in Eq.5? What is such $\\alpha$? The readers are not expecting a choice of parameters (like the mentioned Same \u0301 et al. (2011)), but more from a definition perspective with physical meanings. E.g., in Eq.5, the mixing coefficients should be defined as something related to the regimes partition. Further parameter approximations are then introduced.\n   - Why did the authors choose to spell out $Pa(<t)$ and $Pa(t)$ separately in expressions like Eq.2?\n   - Question: does the proposed method output specific DAGs or equivalent classes? Since with instantaneous relations, usually the exact DAG is unidentifiable non-parametrically. Which is the critical factor that helps the exact identification in this method?"

For example, to show how is the accuracy in identifying the border (changed point) between two regimes.\n- Moreover, is the number of regimes identifiable?

For instance, the ordering of time partitions denoted by $u_1$ and $u_2$ remains unclear \u2013 should the time in $u_1$ consistently precede that in $u_2$? Moreover, the role and interpretation of $\\gamma_{t,u}$ are ambiguous. If $\\gamma_{t,u}$ serves as an indicator for time $t$'s association with partition $u$, its continuous nature as presented in Equation 11 raises questions about how to understand the defined likelihood $\\log p(X_{0:T})$ defined above Equation 8. A presentation from the perspective of variational inference might provide a more systematic and clearer framework, which could naturally elucidate derivations such as that of Equation 11.\n\nConcerning empirical evaluations, the paper's baselines, namely VARLiNGaM and DYNOTEARS, do not represent the stronger baselines. Including stronger method, such as Rhino, could significantly enhance the demonstration of CASTOR's efficacy in regime inference. Matching or exceeding strong baselines would underscore CASTOR's advantages; alternatively, any performance gap would still furnish useful insights into the framework's relative standing and potential areas for enhancement."
