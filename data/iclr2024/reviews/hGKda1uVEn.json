            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Eq. (7) is simply a polynomial hypothesis, possibly feeding into a non-linearity, with degree equal to the number of features. This is an unusual but of course viable model. The authors consider the potential computational burden of the exponential feature explosion, but they do not mention the associated learning theoretical risk, namely overfitting. LASSO-style L1-regularization is hinted at. However, standard L2 regularization is applied in eq. (9), as it is common in SVMs. There is no single word about the need to tune the regularization constant. How do I use a method for estimating feature importance if the resulting values depend on a magic parameter?\n\nProvided that the model is a simple polynomial, and provided that the polynomial kernel is among the few standard kernels considered in basically all SVM research (and all non-linear SVM software packages), I am very much surprised by Lemma 1. Why not simply leverage the polynomial kernel as it is used since 25 years or so?\n\nI am even more surprised by the discussion following eq. (14). For prediction making, an SVM never uses $m$ directly, but only $m^T x$, which can be computed efficiently using the kernel. This is an absolutely basic fact about SVMs and kernel methods in general. I can only conclude that the authors don't really know the methods they aim to leverage. It seems to me that Theorem 1 and the whole section 3.2 can be replaced with the standard prediction making scheme of SVMs. If I am mistaken, then I'd be appreciate being corrected in the rebuttal phase.\n\nFor my taste, the paper contains too many references to the appendix for information that is crucial for understanding the proposed method. This essentially amounts to circumventing the page limit. Put differently: ignoring the appending, the paper is not sufficiently self-contained.\n\nThe choice of combinations of methods and data sets in section 5.2 appears unsystematic. Why were these data sets used and not others? In order to be convinced, I'd like to see experiments on an established data set collection. In this case, it is fine to present a representative subset, with complete tables in the appendix.\n\nTable 2 presents results in terms of the MSE. Is this simply the quality of the model prediction, i.e., testing the fit of a polynomial to another predictor like a random forest? If so, what does it have to do with estimating the correct feature importance? Also, how do the authors justify its use as a measure of quality of an \"explanation\"? What if I fit an RF \"explainer\" to an RF model, with an error of zero? Would the authors then conclude that it is a superior explanation?\n\nFigure 2 can be improved in multiple ways. It definitely needs a log scale on the vertical axis! The range of features from 10 to 20 is extremely narrow, and definitely unsuitable for estimating complexity, which is an inherently asymptotic quantity. Please extend at least to a few hundreds. Simply restrict methods that don't scale well (like the Taylor expansion approach) to smaller dimensions.\n\nI appreciate that the authors provide code. Though, it is not sufficiently commented (or even documented). At the very least, please provide a README explaining prerequisites like required packages, data set files (and where to get them), and an overview of which script is supposed to do what. Naively running the scripts, I was not able to do anything useful with the code, and I was far from reproducing any experiments. Furthermore, the provided zip file contains hidden MACOS and PYTHON temporary files, as well as auto-generated html files and some (huge) javascript. It is entirely unclear to me why they are included.\n\nMinor points:\n\nWhen introducing the notation, please consider replacing the verb \"show\" by \"denote\".\n\nMobius -> M\u00f6bius ({\\\"o} in LaTex)\n\nTerminology, between eq. (8) and (9): $w^T \\phi(x) + b$ is not a hyperplane, but a linear function. For $m \\not= 0$, its kernel (zero set) is a hyperplane.\n\nSection 5.1: Please consider replacing the \"*\" symbol commonly used for multiplication in programming by a LaTeX math symbol like \\cdot or \\times.\n\nFigure 1: What does the vertical axis represent? It is in the text, but the information should really be in the figure caption."
