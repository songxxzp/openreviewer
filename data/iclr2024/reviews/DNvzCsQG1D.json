How does this InstructionGPT-4 compare with the Meta-Weight-Net?\n- The method obtained slightly better scores than the MiniGPT4 for some scores, but it is partially weaker than MiniGPT4. Moreover, in the benchmarks MME and MMBench, MiniGPT4 is a weak baseline. The marginal improvement over MiniGPT4 is not convincing. \n- If the data selector $F$ takes a data sample as input (see questions below for this), then in the paper the authors actually assign the same label to every data sample in the same subset $D_i$, which does not make sense because the label is due to the contribution of the whole subset (the model performance after being trained on the subset).\n\n[1] Shu et al., Meta-Weight-Net: Learning an Explicit Mapping For Sample Weighting"

But in the \"Testing\" paragraph, it seems that the data selector $F$ maps from the feature of a single data sample to a score. Can the authors clarify it?\n- Why did the authors not simply use the quality scores to select a subset for finetuning the final MLLM? It seems that the training data and the testing data for the data selector are the same. What is the meaning of performing the testing if we already have the labels on the data?\n- What is the relationship between the validation data used to generate the quality labels and the evaluation data?

However, considering the variance over the random selection is not massive, I think it's clear the selection method is effective in most cases.\n- The authors only explore one model/architecture, so it is unclear how well their method would apply to larger/different models. In particular, as models scale, they benefit less from instruction data, so it is unclear if the rules for selecting quality data derived from smaller models will transfer to larger models.\n- The GPT-4 evaluation is performed over only 60 questions, which seems quite small. In particular, I worry that 60 questions is not enough to thoroughly test the model over a diverse set of queries that may expose gaps in performance due to the small number of examples seen in finetuning compared to a fully-finetuned model. This can be seen e.g. in Table 2, where InstructionGPT-4 performs significantly worse than MiniGPT-4 in commonsense reasoning and OCR tasks. \n\nOverall, I think the work is solid, and presents an interesting and useful method for data selection. It would be nice to see better validation of the method through repeated trials and over different architectures/datasets, but I think the results presented here are solid, with extensive evaluation."

Why do you think this is?\n- It would be useful and interesting to see when using the data selection method becomes no better than random selection (if this happens) when increasing the number of data points selected (i.e. extending Figure 7 and adding a line for random data selection)."
