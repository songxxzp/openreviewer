The main claim in the paper is that HOGNN usually generates 2-D (or more) representations which cannot be naturally handled by PyG. But my question is why do we have to naturally support this feature (m-D tuple representations)? Using the example NGNN in the paper, NGNN has a 2-D tensor $H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n \\times d}$ where $H_{ij}$ represents the node representation of node $j$ in the subgraph $i$. In this case, I am curious why we cannot directly use a list of 1-D tensors where each item contains node representations in a subgraph. If we use this naive implementation/design, are there any disadvantages? In my view, this is the core/fundamental question for designing a new library and it should be clarified clearly. Otherwise, it is a bit difficult to understand the motivation.\n2. The empirical experimental results are not very informative. In the results, the authors show that the time spent using the proposed PyGHO is less than the time using the original implementation. But there is no detailed analysis for this. I wonder where the efficiency improvement comes from. I believe that the profiling is needed to have a deeper investigation."
