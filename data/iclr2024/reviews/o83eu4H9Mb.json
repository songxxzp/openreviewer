The proposed method consists of three stages that reflect the idea: (1) extract main features (2) find the most salient features -- make a copy of features with the salient ones removed (3) joint training of the features found in (1) and (2)."

Why not just minimizing the mutual information between $\\mathbf{z}_S$ and $\\mathbf{z}_M$?"
