The proposed benchmark incorporates human-subject ratings across diverse quality dimensions and ten robustness checks to gauge metric performance under varying conditions. Additionally, the study delves into several metric approaches, revealing that none of them prove successful on ContextRef due to their insensitivity to fundamental changes in examples. Lastly, the paper suggests that careful fine-tuning has the potential to enhance metric performance while acknowledging the ongoing challenge of effectively accounting for context."

Authors first build an evaluation dataset as a subset of the WIT dataset comprising 204 image-caption-context-description samples. This dataset is used for a user study, where humans are rating the quality of different image description across multiple axes. Human preference is then used as a reference to evaluate the quality of referenceless metric, alongside measures of metric robustness by applying several transformations to the generated descriptions. Finally, authors investigate whether model-based metrics can be improved by fine-tuning models on human scores and augmentations."

Providing a solution to understand which metrics are most accurate has the potential to be very useful.  \n\nAuthors have evaluated a large set of model-based evaluation metrics, with the somewhat low correlations suggesting a lack of reliability. Furthermore, the reference dataset and associated human study are a useful resource that could be used to evaluate future metrics."

The related work section is focusing almost solely on the clip model,and fails to provide an accurate review of pre-existing related literature. Authors should review pre-existing metrics, related benchmarks and evaluation strategies. Similarly, section 3 provides descriptions of metrics being analysed in this work, and lacks accurate descriptions to understand the particularities of each method. For example, only encoder architectures are discussed for the Flamingo model, but the actual mechanisms used to compute the metric are not discussed. The strategy used to integrate context information as also poorly explained, and could benefit from providing equations. \n\nCertain claims seem excessive. Authors mention that their results suggests that referenceless metrics can be successfully used based on observed correlation, however somewhat low correlations are observed (.2-.3), suggesting the opposite. In addition, the use of context is highlighted multiple times throughout the paper, yet the impact of integrating this context variable is barely discussed, the only relevant experiment is the use of shuffled contexts in section 5.2. It would have been interesting to discuss context more in depth and how it impacts user evaluation and metric performance. \n\nThe fine-tuning experiment in section 6 doesn\u2019t seem particularly necessary, as metrics become tailored for a specific dataset/user preference, This reduces applicability and generalizability, and seem to contradict the main objective of the paper."

Can authors clarify how related these two strategies are?"
