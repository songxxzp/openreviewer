                "value": "This work studied a distributionally robust federated learning problem, where the problem tries to improve the fairness among clients by optimizing a class of distributionally robust objective functions plus a regularizer that aims to keep the weights $\\lambda$ not far from the average weights. The resulting problem now becomes a min-max problem, where the max is take over weights within a prior constraint set $\\Gamma$ and the min is taken over the model parameters $x$ to minimize the weighted loss across all clients. The regularizer is chosen to be the penalty from Levy et al., 2020. The authors propose an accelerated primal-duel federated method using some tools from the variance-reduction idea in SCAFFOLD as well as an extrapolation step for acceleration. In theory, the authors characterize the convergence rate for the proposed method for the strongly-convex-concave and strongly-convex-strongly-concave geometry, which matches with centralized version under certain conditions. Experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1.\tThe formulation seems not to be quite new given existing studies. Although the authors show that their formulation is a generalization of existing ones, directly applying the distributionally robust objective (i.e., client weights optimized over a set of candidate distribution) is not new. The $\\Phi$ regularizer seems not to add too much new things into the formulation as well. In sum, although the formulation is general, the idea and individual components are not new. \n\n2.\tThe algorithms do not incorporate many new stuffs. For example, the SCAFFORD bias correction, the extrapolated step for min-max acceleration have been well studied. The proposed algorithm seems to apply to the general federated min-max problem. However, since the DRO-FL problem has its special structure, i.e., $\\lambda$ is linear in the first part of the total objective and the regularizer may still have some benign and dedicated structure in terms of $\\lambda$. It may be more interesting to explore such architecture to get better results rather than in the worst-case setting of federated minmax case. In sum, the developed algorithms are not existing enough. \n\n3.\tTheory is not strong. The analysis is only conducted for strongly-convex-(strongly)-concave settings, while most practical examples work under the nonconvex setting. In addition, there are quite a few works on general federated nonconvex-concave/PL/strong-concave setting (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04249 and related works therein). It would be great to discuss why only strongly-convex-(strongly)-concave settings are studied here. Again, the analysis is mainly developed for general case without taking the DRO min-max structure into account. \n\n4.\tExperiments can be made more convincing. The improvements in Table 1 are not that significant. In some cases, the worst-20% results are improved with too much loss in average accuracy. For example, for $\\alpha=0.1$, worst-20% increases from 29.5 to 29.78, but the average accuracy drops from 46.11 to 41.23."

Lemma B.2 is wrong and the proof is also wrong, which leads to the soundness of Theorem B.6 and Theorem 5.1. Specifically, \nto prove \n\\begin{equation}\nt_r(\\frac{1}{\\tau_r}+ \\mu_{\\boldsymbol{x}}) \\geq \\frac{t_{r+1}}{\\tau_{r+1}},\n \\end{equation}\nwe should not start from rewritting this equation, which already assumes that this inequality is correct. The procedure I did is shown below:\n\\begin{equation}\nt_r(\\frac{1}{\\tau_r}+ \\mu_{\\boldsymbol{x}}) =\\frac{t_r}{\\tau_r} (1+ \\mu_{\\boldsymbol{x}}{\\tau_r}) = \\frac{t_r}{\\tau_r} \\frac{\\gamma_{r+1}}{\\gamma_r}  = \\frac{\\sigma_r}{\\sigma_0\\tau_r} \\frac{\\gamma_{r+1}}{\\gamma_r}  = \\frac{\\sigma_r}{\\sigma_0\\tau_r} \\frac{\\sigma_{r+1}/\\tau_{r+1}}{\\sigma_r/\\tau_r}   = \\frac{\\sigma_{r+1}/\\tau_{r+1}}{\\sigma_0} =  \\frac{t_{r+1}}{\\tau_{r+1}}.\n \\end{equation}\nThat means there is no greater than or equal to relationship, the two sides always equal to each other. Meanwhile, $\\frac{t_r}{\\sigma_r} = \\frac{t_{r+1}}{\\sigma_{r+1}}$. \n\n3. From the assumptions and the definition of all symbols, I recognized that $\\tau_r = J\\eta_l\\eta_g$, which indicates that $\\tau_{r+1} = J\\eta_l\\eta_g$, too, if I did not miss anything. That means, for equation B.38, with $\\frac{t_r}{t_r+1} = \\theta_r$, we must have $V_{r+1}\\leq \\theta_{r+1}Z_{r+1}$, which however, is based on the condition that $\\theta_{r+1}>1$. However, $\\theta_{r+1} = \\frac{\\sigma_r}{\\sigma_{r+1}} = \\frac{\\gamma_r\\tau_r}{\\gamma_{r+1}\\tau_{r+1}} = \\frac{\\tau_r}{(1+ \\mu_{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\tau_r)\\tau_{r+1}} = \\frac{1}{1+ \\mu_{\\boldsymbol{x}}{\\tau_r}}<1$, which contradicts the assumption, which leads to me doubt about the soundness of the theorems. Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\n4. The experiments on synthetic and real datasets seem contradict each other. For example, Figure 2 shows that larger $\\rho$ leads to higher convergence rate while Figure 3 as well as in the analysis says \u201cMeanwhile, the experimental results suggest that smaller $\\rho$ leads to faster convergence w.r.t. worst-20% accuracy for our algorithm.\u201d Which one is correct and why larger/smaller $\\rho$ leads to faster convergence?\n\nI am willing to discuss and change my rating if my comments can be addressed. \n\nMinor comments:\n1.

However, there is no discussion about this in the main part.\n2. In the main part there is no expression for local stepsize. \n3. The formulation of Theorem 5.5 is not full. There is no word about the smoothness of function $f$. \n4. It is good that the authors compare Proxskip and SCAFF-PD theoretically, however, there are a lot of new algorithms of 5th generation of local methods (see some of them here in the literature review https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09832.pdf). Better to say some words about them and compare. Another interesting thing is related to ProxSkip for variational inequalities (see https://openreview.net/forum?id=ct_s9E1saB1). There is no comparison between SCAFF-PD and this algorithm. \n5. In the experiments, there is no comparison between the performances of SCAFF-PD and ProxSkip."

                "value": "1. Could you explain whether your proposed method has a speed up related to number of clients and number of local steps, which is observed for SCAFFOLD? \n2. Please, add explanation for derivation of eq. (B.59) from eq.(B.57)\n\ntypos:\n1.  In (A.1) one of $z$ in the last term have to be $x$.\n2. in the first sentence of proof of Lemma A.4, probably, there is no need $4$ in denominator. \n3. In the next sentence after eq. (B.17) in the formula for $\\tau_r$, there is an extra bracket."
