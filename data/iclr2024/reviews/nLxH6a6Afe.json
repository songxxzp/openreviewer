                "value": "This paper proposes an alternative to RL-based methods (e.g.: RLHF) for improving the quality of generations from instruction-tuned models by distilling preferences from other language models and using them in a supervised finetuning setup. Particularly, a teacher LLM is used to improve a student LLM by 1) generating a rubric (or criteria for good responses) for each instruction in an instruction-tuning dataset, and 2) iteratively rewriting the student's response given the rubric and the current response.\n\nThe student is initialized by training it on the instruction tuning dataset using SFT and then continued to be trained to rewrite its responses given the targets from the teacher. At inference time, a rubric is retrieved from the set generated for the training data, and an iterative process is followed to generate the student's response.\n\nThis process is used to train a Llama-7B model on the Alpaca dataset, and it is evaluated against SFT, RLHF,  RRHF (Yuan et al., 2023; RLHF with ranking instead of pairwise preferences) and RAFT (Dong et al. 2023; use reward model to select training data) in terms of win-rate according to GPT-4 on a held-out subset of Alpaca, reading comprehension, factual knowledge, and commonsense datasets."

                "value": "Algorithm: The student is trained as a response rewriter given a rubric during the iterative process. This raises the following concerns:\n\n- Because of this formulation the student model requires a rubric and a version of the response to rewrite at inference time. The dependence on additional inputs might impact the generalizability of the student model as obtaining. Particularly, the rubrics generated for the training data may not generalize to the new instructions at inference time.\n- Moreover, the inference process is required to be iterative due to this algorithm, and hence requires additional compute.\n- Since the student is initialized using SFT on the instruction tuning dataset, the initial draft responses produced by the model may be of good quality, but continuing to train it to be a rewriter might affect the original instruction following capabilities. An evaluation of the original drafts produced by the student after the iterative training might be helpful.\n\nOne solution to address the concerns above could be to train a separate rewriter (conditioned on the rubric and the previous responses), and iteratively finetune the student model only on the instruction following task (i.e., not condition its outputs on the rubric and previous responses)\n\nBaselines: This paper proposes multiple changes compared to the current RL from feedback setup for improving instruction tuning models: having the teacher generate a rubric, continued training of models with SFT, curriculum learning with minimal rewrites given by a teacher. These are all orthogonal improvements and can be evaluated separately. The current evaluation setup conflates these changes. I propose the following additional baselines:\n- Effect of continued training: Simply train the student model with additional SFT steps, and do not use a teacher model at all. The current comparison between CITING and SFT is not entirely fair because CITING uses additional training steps.\n- Effect of the rubrics: Use the teacher model to generate a rubric and train the student model with additional SFT steps also conditioned on the rubric.\n- Fairer comparison with RLHF: RLHF might perform better with better pairwise preference data. A good baseline would be to generate rewrites from a teacher model and use them to train a reward model and perform RLHF."

It might be good to compare CITING with these methods, or at least discuss why the contribution of this work is significant.\n\nI'm not fully convinced about the method of how you assign quality scores to the generated data. In Section 3.2, why does the fact that the candidate instructions have their embeddings near those of rubrics mean that the candidates are legit? In terms of the Appendix, the so-called rubrics are basically some descriptions or requirements of a certain task --- do we really need a complex pipeline like CITING or we can simply include them as the \"system message\" in the few-shot examples (for augmentation)?\n\nAlso, there is no code and data uploaded as supplementary materials, which causes some difficulties for me to fully understand your method.\n\n[1] Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4\n\n[2] WizardLM: Empowering Large Language Models to Follow Complex Instructions\n\n[3] MAmmoTH: Building Math Generalist Models through Hybrid Instruction Tuning"
