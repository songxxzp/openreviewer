The experiments consider two benchmarks: (1) FairEval along with human annotation results from Wu et al. (2023) \u2013 containing 80 open-ended questions with three annotators\u2019 annotations on two model outputs and (2) Topical-Chat along with human annotation results from Mehri & Eskenazi (2020) \u2013 containing 60 dialogue contexts with human annotation on six model outputs. Based on the findings, the authors claim that ChatEval \u201cdelivers superior accuracy and correlation in alignment with human assessment.\u201d In addition, they find that using diverse role prompts (using different personas) helps improve performance."

In doing so, however, it is unclear how the main goal of the proposed approach mirrors or differs from prior work (other than the proposed method itself; scoping the contribution/types of tasks more tightly can help here) and what kind of pros and cons or trade-offs there are in comparison to these other works that also leverage multiple LLMs. I\u2019d encourage the authors to provide more information on this aspect both in introduction and related work, as I find the current explanation to be a bit hard to understand in the related work (i.e., \u201cConcurrent with our work, Li et al. (2023b); Zhang et al. (2023) also propose a similar approach. However, they probe different dimensions of improving LLM-based evaluators and do not explore the effectiveness of natural language interaction.\u201d In this sentence, what are \u201cdifferent dimensions\u201d and what does \u201cnatural language interaction\u201d mean here?)\n* I think the idea of exploring diverse role specifications and communication strategies has a lot of potential. However, the current version that\u2019s explored in the paper lacks depth and justification. For instance, there is one line justification for how the diverse role specification was formulated (\u201cWe take inspiration from Wu et al. (2023) and formulate an analogous role description.\u201d), but it is unclear what other alternatives there are, why this is a good baseline to default to, what potential limitations are with this approach. Same thing applies to the design of communication strategies. The authors designed three strategies, but it is unclear how the design decisions were made and what factors are accounted for.\n* Regarding the experiments, I have some concerns about the authors\u2019 main claim. In Table 1, it\u2019s unclear whether the difference between different methods is meaningful since it\u2019s smaller than the difference between human annotators. More discussion on the inter-annotator agreement and how we should interpret the results would be necessary to make the claim about \u201csuperior accuracy and correlation\u201d.  To account for a small number of instances, I\u2019d highly encourage the authors to include standard deviations or errors on all tables and figures. On the other hand, I do appreciate that the authors delve into the importance of diverse role prompts, communication strategies, and the impact of role numbers and discussion turns. However, the qualitative analysis lacks nuance when reporting the finding; I\u2019d be very cautious to call model behaviors \u201chuman-like\u201d and \u201cnot just as a tool [...] but as an embodiment of interactive natural language dialogue\u201d solely based on the four patterns observed in the experiments.\n* Overall, I find the paper to have much room for improvement in terms of writing, need for more justification and explanation for design choices for the proposed method, and need more rigor in analyzing and reporting the experiment results."

                "value": "This paper focuses on the task of automatic text evaluation and highlights the limitations of existing n-gram metrics in correlating with human judgments. The authors propose ChatEval, a framework leveraging LLMs for automatic text evaluation. Instead of prompting a single LLM to assess the generation quality, ChatEval integrates multiple LLMs, facilitating debates among them to enhance the robustness and human-like quality of evaluation results."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The paper may benefit from providing more in-depth technical details about the ChatEval framework. While a prompt template is present in the appendix, the determination of LLM roles and the potential impact of varying roles and orders remain unclear. In addition, the framework relies on prompting LLMs, however, the paper lacks sufficient information on the design of prompts and their robustness.\n2. The evaluation results present a challenge in assessing whether the multi-agent debate framework outperforms existing LLM-based evaluators in general cases. Addressing questions related to the listed questions would contribute to a more informed judgment."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "1. As mentioned in section 3.2, two agents are employed in the implementation of ChatEval. Can they always reach an agreement at the end of debates?\n\n2. Regarding Table 2, does \"MA\" in the table represent multiple agents employed in the debating way. Are there corresponding results for multiple LLMs used in an ensemble manner, aligning with the methods in Table 1?\n\n3. Considering the performance gap between G-EVAL-3.5 and ChatGPT(MA) in Table 2 for dialogue response generation, it appears that the effectiveness of the proposed framework is influenced by the chosen LLM. Has there been an evaluation of ChatEval's generalization ability?\n\n4. It seems that the G-Eval framework can be easily adapted to open-ended QA evaluation. From the performance differences in Table 2 between G-Eval and ChatEval, I wonder whether the multiple-agent debating framework really works better than the single-agent COT framework?"
