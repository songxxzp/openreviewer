                "value": "This paper introduces BATTLE, a novel universal behavior-oriented adversarial attack method designed to induce specific behaviors in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents. Unlike prior approaches that focus on directing agents towards predetermined states or policies, BATTLE employs an intention policy aligned with human preferences for flexible behavior orientation, guiding the victim agent to imitate it. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of BATTLE through empirical results across various manipulation tasks in Meta-world, showing its superiority over existing adversarial attack algorithms. Additionally, BATTLE enhances the robustness of DRL agents by training with the attacker, achieving a convergence guarantee under mild conditions, and proving effective even against the latest Decision Transformer agents. In summary, the paper makes contributions in the realm of behavior-oriented adversarial attacks on DRL agents, both in theory and practical applications."

The assumption that an adversary can modify observations is strong and raises questions about practicality. For instance, if an adversary has the ability to control the sensor, they might as well directly control the effector, making an agent-based adversarial approach seem more practical. Additionally, the rationale for using preference-based RL remains unclear.\n4. The paper lacks some critical methodological details. For example, it doesn't specify how the victim policy approximator is trained or the volume of data required, leaving gaps in the understanding of the implementation.\n5. The experimental setup and evaluations could be more convincing. The choice of baselines (PA-AD and SA-RL), which are un-targeted attacks, makes the comparison seem potentially unfair.

Second, they train a weighting function to help prioritize relevant states and keep the next step from policy drift.

I do not think this makes sense as an explanation of why an intention policy is needed instead of a direct attack.\n    - I do not understand figure 1. Why is there an arrow between reward learning and the replay buffer?\n    - Numerous grammar mistakes. I would recommend using a grammarly browser plugin.\n2. This may speak to either issues with my reading of the paper, its writing, or the quality of the experiments. But I am unsure why BATTLE trains an intention policy with PbRL instead of just training the adversarial policy directly with PbRL. This would seem to be substantially simpler. \n3. I do not understand how SA-RL can perform so poorly relative to BATTLE unless it is just due to reward shaping. What is the reward function used for SA-RL? If an adversarial policy is directly trained to minimize the agent\u2019s reward, how can this do worse than BATTLE at making the target agents\u2019 reward be minimized? If the key difference truly is just reward shaping, then this paper would just seem to be one about how PbRL makes reward shaping automatic and implicit. And if so, then this paper would seem to have no novelty.\n4. Relatedly, I do not understand why this paper is about adversarial attacks. BATTLE could be used to make RL policies do anything \u2014 not just to targetedly adversarially attack them. But in reality, to make RL policies do things, we just finetune them directly. This relates to why I do not understand why the intention policy was used. Why not just finetune the target angent or adversary directly wit pbrl?"

In experiments, the authors mainly evaluate the attack success rate. However, it is not clear how the success rate is defined. Is it based on whether the victim acts as the intention policy suggests? But would it be biased since the intention policy is just an approximation of the real human intention? What if the intention learning does not learn a desired reward model or intention policy?\n3. For baselines, the authors used the codebases of SA-RL and PA-AD and modified their attack's reward as the learned reward. However, this straightforward modification of the PA-AD baseline contradicts with the original method (PA-AD's formulation is for a reward-minimizing adversary, so directly replacing the attacker's reward may not work). Since the original PA-AD method is to use an RL director to find the target policy and to use an actor to conduct targeted attack, a more natural modification of PA-AD in the behavior attack scenario can be to directly use the learned intention policy as the target of actor ($\\hat{a}$ in Equation (G) in the original paper)."
