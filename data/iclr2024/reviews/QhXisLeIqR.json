Traditional Transformer-based approaches, despite their advancements, struggle with computational efficiency and capturing the periodicity of time series data. WinNet seeks to address these issues with its unique architecture:\n\n1. **Inter-Intra Period Encoder (I2PE):** Converts a 1D sequence into a 2D tensor, capturing both long and short periodicities.\n2. **Two-Dimensional Period Decomposition (TDPD):** Models period-trend and oscillation terms, emphasizing the significance of periodicity in time series data.\n3. **Decomposition Correlation Block (DCB):** Exploits the correlations between period-trend and oscillation terms, enhancing prediction capabilities.\n\nA pivotal concept introduced is the \"periodic window,\" derived as the least common multiple of multiple periods obtained via Fourier Frequency Transformation. This enables the model to represent variations of multiple short periods and organizes the sequence into a 2D tensor, wherein each row signifies a short-period trend and each column stands for the long-period trend.\n\nWinNet's innovations result in a simplified structure with a single convolutional layer at its core, which significantly reduces computational complexity. Moreover, this model outperforms various baselines in both univariate and multivariate prediction tasks across multiple domains, as evidenced by experiments conducted on nine benchmark datasets."

However, one of the advantages of Transformer methods is their ability to capture interrelationships amongst multi-variables. Evaluating CNN-based methods purely on accuracy might not provide a fair comparison. Moreover, several existing methods, such as Seq-VAE, leverage CNN for MTS tasks.
