This is effective when only partial symmetries exist in the data, even in the case where each class has a different group element distribution acting on it. This work focuses solely on the SO(2) group (continuous rotations). An additional network $\\Theta$ that predicts the rotation is included on top of IE-AE, as well as a strategy based on Nearest-Neighbors to estimate the boundary of the uniform distribution.\n\nThe overall method is very well presented, and nicely backed with theory. The experiments on MNIST-like datasets also back the theory up, showing accurate learning of the symmetry boundaries."

In that sense, I would strongly suggest the authors to explore (at least) CIFAR-like data, with 32x32 RGB images.\n\n* There are some unanswered questions related to data that is inherently invariant to SO(2). For example, the Flowers dataset contains top-down photos of flowers, known to be almost invariant to rotation. Some experiment showing the limitations of the method (in this sense or another) would be extremely welcome.\n  * In a similar vein, another way to show the limitations of the method (and strengths hopefully!) is to perform an experiment on data that does not strictly obey a uniform distribution of group elements.\n\n* The work lacks an ablation study, given that several losses are combined, and there exist additional parameters such as $k$. Additionally, in the appendix there is mention to an additional consistency loss that is not mentioned in the main body, which I think should be amended for scientific rigour."

            "questions": {
                "value": "* The estimation of the symmetry boundary using $E=2 \\overline{|\\psi(N_k(x))|}$ is tailored for distributions of the form $U(-\\theta,\\theta)$. Have the authors thought about generalizing the method to arbitrary distributions? Even if it is only the case of arbitrarily bounded uniform distributions. In such case, the concept of \"center of symmetry\" as explained in the paper would not be valid anymore. Although uniform symmetry distributions are sensible, multimodal ones could naturally arise in datasets too.\n     * Related to this question, one experiment that would be interesting is to have non-overlaping rotation intervals per class (instead of all being subsets of the next class as in MNISTMultiple). \n\n* As far as I understand, the center of symmetry is an abstraction for \"canonical rotation\", which could be any absolute angle in practice. Therefore, the proposed method cannot estimate the absolute rotation of an image, but only the rotation wrt. its canonical one. Is this correct? \n  * What is the role of $L_2$. In general, it pushes the estimation given by $\\psi$ to be concentrated around $e$, right? Is the underlying idea to use it as some sort of regularization? \n\n* How limiting is the assumption _\"we shift from using equivalence classes $[x]$ to sets of objects semantically similar to $x$ for estimating $\\theta_x$\"_. Would it be possible to find the equivalence classes in practice? Or this is a form that helps the theoretical aspect of the method only?\n\n* Substituting the equivalence class by the $k$-Nearest Neighbors might rely strongly on the NT-Xent loss being satisfied. How important is the NT-Xent loss? I think an ablation of the different losses that compose the final loss would be of interest for this work, so readers understand the contributions and how to practically use the proposed approach.\n  * Additionally, NT-Xent usually requires quite large batch sizes. What is the training setting in this case? How are the positive and negative pairs formed?\n  * Is there a way to bound the boundary estimation error as a function of $k$?\n\n* In the Appendix I read: _\"An additional consistency loss is trained to ensure that the representations created by the contrastive routine and the reconstruction routine are similar and do not conflict each other.\"_\n  * Can the authors elaborate on this? If there is an additional loss that helps improve the results, I would suggest to include it in the main body of the paper. This adds another weighing parameter to the overall loss, which reinforces the need of an ablation study in that sense.\n\n* What do the up-down arrows from $\\theta$ to $\\hat{\\theta}$ represent in Figure 3? I suggest replacing them with \"MSE\" or $L_3$. Additionally, writing \"supervised learning\" might mislead some reader. It is supervised, but with pseudo-labels, which is a much less strong condition of the method (no need for annotations). \n  * Additionally, I suggest the authors to highlight in Figure 3 where the proposed losses are applied. For example $L_1$ takes the left and right $X$s. Loss $L_3$ takes $\\theta$ and $\\hat{\\theta}$, etc. \n\n* About results in Table 2 (Improving non-equivariant models with symmetry standardization). I notice that the improvement becomes smaller as the range of rotation is smaller. What is the intuition behind that effect? In that Table, how does the proposed method compare with a method that infuses equivariance without knowledge of distribution like IE-AE? I think this comparison is required, to understand whether the improvements shown are significative wrt. SOTA.\n\n* How does the method behave for images inherently invariant to rotation (eg. a circle). This would be the case of the Flowers dataset for example, where many flowers are photographed top-down and appear centered and \"almost\" invariant to rotation.\n\n* I suggest adding [Suau et al. ICML 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16058) given some similarities in the spirit of the work. In such paper, equivariances are learnt from data, and the distribution over $g$ elements is naturally learnt.\n\n----\n**Overall comment:**\n\nThe paper is very well written, almost typo-less, and with excellent language. I enjoyed the reading, I thank the authors for that. The theoretical formulation is solid, and the proposed method to learn symmetry boundaries is novel to the best of my knowledge. However, I still think this paper could strongly benefit from experiments with data beyond MNIST, as well as a thorough ablation study, as mentioned before. I also suggest to add some explicit discussion about the strengths and limitations of the method."

                "value": "1] While the decision to generalize the setting of previous works (especiall w.r.t. Partial-G-CNNs and IE-AE) to deal with partial, per-item distributions, in an unsupervised manner, the result is much more limited and less applicable as a result:\n* The assumption of pure rotation, that is uniformly distributed over a single segment (practically a 1-parameter estimation problem) is very limited and unnatural. This can be compared to IE-AE that handle discrete and continuous groups, including rotations, translations and permutations.\n* This limited setting is very obvious in the testing, which includes only uniformly rotated versions of MNIST. The above mentioned methods include demonstrating the potential on some slightly more realistic datasets (such as CIFAR and Shapenet), where there is no control or no way to model the true underlying symmetries. Especially when considering the potential of unsupervised learning, it is a little disappointing to see it demonstrated on controlled data that could allow fully supervised training.\n* There is not much of a discussion as to how you could drop some of the assumptions, if desired. For example, the uniformity is currently what enables rather easily estimating the center of the range and its boundaries. What would happen with other types and distributions of symmetries?\n\n2] The need for  (and the quality of) the self-supervision and the boundary prediction network $\\Theta$ itself is unclear. What I mean here is that it is not the case that the network $\\Theta$ can generalize to a new dataset, so for the given dataset, you still have to run the pre-training and then, given a new sample, you could just predict the pseudo-label itself. I imagine that it would be more precise, but perhaps less efficient because of the nearest neighbor computation. This should further explained.\n\n3] The way of calculating nearest neighbors is not specified (or perhaps I missed it). This is critical for identifying the equivalence classes."

(which would perhaps require dropping the uniform or continuous assumptions, or perhaps trying other more general classes of symmetry)."
