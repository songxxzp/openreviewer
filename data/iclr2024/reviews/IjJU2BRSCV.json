While the loss L_Q uses the Q-learning update rule (using the $\\max$ operator), the stochastic branch selection is more similar to the (expected) SARSA update rule. I'm wondering if this mis-match is a problem. In particular, is it even possible for the loss L_Q to go to zero: For example, even if we assumed we had learned the correct Q-function, I think L_Q wouldn't be 0?\n2. The loss L_D has the known downside that it pushes the action-values of actions not in the dataset to -infty. This is (somewhat) intended, but unlike in typically used learned Q-functions, here the Q-function is represented as a tree search. Hence the question arises of how the DTS Q-function represents the large negative Q-values and to what extends this creates problems?"

At a high level this work builds upon TreeQN and incorporates a best-first search algorithm for expanding the tree as opposed to the breadth-first approach taken by TreeQN. Whereas TreeQN expands all nodes up to a fixed depth, and thus has exponential complexity based on the branching factor, the primary contribution of this work is to selectively expand nodes based on their expected value which is not subject to the same blow-up in complexity and allows the algorithm to evaluate deeper. To do so in a way that isn't subject to discontinuities the authors expand nodes by sampling proportional to the softmax of the expected value of the entire path. \n\nThe authors also present a number of other improvements including a variance reduction technique based on a telescoping sum as noted by Guez et al. which takes advantage of the fact that by expanding the loss include repeated terms that add variance but are zero in expectation.\n\nSimilarly the authors apply their approach to problems in Batch RL using examples from an optimal policy, and hence they also introduce a term from CQL to address Q-function overestimation for infrequently visited states.\n\nTheir results show that these techniques improve over the various baselines on a number of procgen tasks."

This is addressing a real problem, but it's not clear by looking at the results that it gives a significant gain, although it clearly does provide gains. The additional minor contributions (e.g. the telescoping variance reduction technique and the CQL loss) are similarly minor. The first follows from other standard procedures for reducing variance for REINFORCE-style algorithms and the second is necessary but is one of a standard family of approaches which addresses the batch-RL setting (see my next point).\n\n(2) It is unclear why the authors are specifically addressing the batch RL setting. It would in my opinion be much more interesting to apply this to the online or at least growing batch setting. When learning the latent transition models and using them to inform how the tree is expanded the use of data from an optimal policy is particularly strong, and potentially more simple techniques based on behavioral cloning could be applied. This adds a new dimension that I'm not sure is necessary to compare against the original technique (and requires more info on how the data is generated, etc.).\n\n(3) Finally while the presentation of the work is reasonable there are a number of points where the the fundamental algorithm being discussed is not quite clear. In particular the pseudocode is only included in the appendix, and even the definition of the loss being optimized (e.g. the TD-error) is only defined in the appendix. Similarly the precise definition of what a node is is unclear, and things like the latent state are represented as h_t or h_n depending on whether this is depth or node. This can be inferred, but this section should be given another pass to make it much more explicit about what the algorithm is doing."
