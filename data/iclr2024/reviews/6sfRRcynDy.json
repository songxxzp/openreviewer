From the training perspective, the authors train a hyperspherical embedding based on the von Mises-Fisher distribution based on the MLE objective. Then, they use the hyperspherical free energy as a test objective. The authors show the efficacy of the proposed method in out-of-distribution detection benchmarks with varying sizes. Furthermore, as the evaluation metric does not rely on the nearest neighbors, the method significantly excels in computational speed compared to alternative out-of-distribution methods that rely on the test scores."

                "value": "Although I am fond of the simple and efficient out-of-distribution detection algorithm as a baseline for further research, I have various concerns about this paper, including novelty, clarity, and significance.\n\nOriginality\\\n(1) Authors train the hyperspherical embedding via MLE loss, as done in previous papers [1,2]. \\\n(2) Authors focus on novelty in testing measures but this is just a proxy term for the negative log-likelihood. Although the perception of novelty is subjective, I also do not find this high-level concept of applying likelihood for OOD detection surprising or novel.\n\nClarity\\\n(1) While this paper's concept is simple, the paper lacks details.\\\n(2) For example, I found it confusing to directly compare CIDER, SIREN, and the proposed loss function since CIDER and SIREN impose additional regularization terms. \\\n(3) Or a basic specification for random variable z.\n\nSignificance\\\n(1) The paper frameworks the work as cross-entropy vs hyperspherical embeddings. But I do not think the comparison is fair. Classifiers trained by cross-entropy loss are widespread and easily collected in the wild. A strategy tailored to output OOD detection statistics from pre-trained classifiers via CE loss gets its merit due to its ubiquity. However, I do not feel the same applies to the hyperspherical embeddings. Instead, this is a pre-training strategy like [3,4]. Hence, I feel like the method should be **compared against various state-of-the-art** OOD detection methods when (image, label) information is given.\\\n(2) I find the gain of this method as a postprocessing strategy is limited. For example, [5] scores 94.28\\%, [6] scores 95.06\\%, and greatly outperforms the performance of this method despite being trained on the CE loss. While this method can benefit its performance by combining such methods, it is not sure in the current experiment results and should be verified via extra experiments.\\\n(3) Furthermore, I am also skeptical of hyperspherical embedding as a training strategy that learns better representation **in general**. A recently proposed benchmark of [7] compares CIDER [2] (which originates from the same training framework as this paper) to other strategies and shows its deficit in Near-OODs (e.g. SSB-Hard, NINCO) even compared to a simple rotation prediction strategy [8]. Moreover, it scores the worst among all compared to pretraining strategies. I think the bold assumption of this paper of showcasing hyperspherical embedding as an effective training loss should be verified by comparing other strategies (e.g. AugMix, RandAugment, RegMixup) on such challenging OOD, instead of comparing against only easy ones.\\\n(4) While I mainly focused on criticizing on ImageNet-1k dataset, the same reasoning can be applied to CIFAR-100 given the low scores in Table 1. of [7].\n\nIn summary,  given that this work is outperformed by various works that perform OOD detection on a classifier trained by CE or other strategies, I do not find any reason why should we train the classifier on hyperspherical embeddings (which is a very time-consuming task, especially for larger real-world datasets) and then perform OOD detection. Furthermore, I feel like this paper proposes a straightforward combination of existing works: hyperspherical embedding for training and energy function for OOD detection. Hence, I lean towards rejection."

It introduces a novel framework known as \"Hyperspherical Energy\" for OOD detection, which connects energy with hyperspherical representations, offering a rigorous perspective from a log-likelihood standpoint. The method is designed to provide a reliable and theoretically justified OOD detection indicator, addressing the limitations of energy-based scores derived from models trained with cross-entropy loss. Hyperspherical energy operates on latent embeddings, modeled as hyperspherical embeddings with constant norm, and is based on the negative log partition function of the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. The paper includes theoretical derivations and optimization techniques. Notably, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance on OOD detection benchmarks, outperforming some baselines. The paper highlights the key distinctions and advantages of Hyperspherical Energy compared to conventional energy-based methods and non-parametric density estimation techniques. It is shown to achieve both strong empirical performance and theoretical soundness."

                "value": "1. What can be said of the _absolute_ OOD detection performance of the proposed method? For example in Table 3, is an average FPR95 of 38.5 good? Does the method actually perform well? In the Introduction you write _\"The ability to detect OOD samples is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models, especially in real-world applications where the consequences of misidentifying OOD samples can be severe\"_, does the method perform well enough for this important task?\n\n2. Can anything be said about common failure cases? For example, why is there such a big performance difference between Places365 and LSUN?\n\n3. Does the proposed method have any limitations?\n\n4. Could the proposed OOD detection approach be extended to regression problems (I am mostly just curious)?\n\n\nMinor things:\n- In equation (13), is $\\mathcal{L}$ the loss from equation (12)? ($\\mathcal{L}$ is not really defined anywhere?)\n- I was confused by how $\\cdot$ is used both to multiply scalars (e.g. in (1) and (5)) and vectors (e.g. $\\mu_c \\cdot z$ in (6) and (7)).\n- Introduction, \"Hyperspherical energy vs. energy\" bullet point, \"Liu et al. (2020) employ cross-entropy loss and derive energy from the unconstrained Euclidean space\": cross-entropy loss --> a/the cross-entropy loss?\n- Introduction, \"Hyperspherical energy vs. energy\" bullet point, \"constrained hyperspherical distribution\": distribution --> distributions?\n- Introduction, \"Hyperspherical energy vs. energy\" bullet point, \"our method enjoys ... theoretical property\": This sounds a bit odd?\n- Section 2, \"EBM (Lecun et al., 2006) captures...\": EBM --> An EBM?\n- Section 2, \"a connection between EBM and discriminative models\": EBM --> EBMs?\n- Section 2, \"Limitation of Liu et al. (2020)\" paragraph: This description is perhaps a bit too short/condensed?\n- Section 3.3: \"SupCon loss\u2019s formulation\" --> \"SupCon's loss formulation\"?\n- Section 3.3: Add a reference for SupCon?"
