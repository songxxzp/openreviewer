Specifically, I am inclined to give \"reject\" for the following reasons:\n\n**Weakness 1 : Difficult to figure out the \"main\" contribution**\n- There are too many proposed integrators, and it is difficult to figure out which one is / ones are the \"main\" contribution of the paper. More specifically, it is difficult to see in which situation we should prefer one integrator over the other. To me, it seems like the authors are taking a very unclear stance on their \"main\" sampler : the authors are proposing a whole arsenal of samplers, and picking results which happened to beat some baselines results under very specific dataset+sampler+hyper-parameter combinations.\n- For instance, what is the rationale behind choosing $B_t = \\lambda I$ and $B_t = \\lambda 1$? When should we prefer DDIM-I over DDIM-II and vice versa? While there is a theorem on DDIM-I, I don't see any theorem on DDIM-II, which could clarify differences between DDIM-I and DDIM-II.\n- Also, readers could expect conjugate+splitting integrators to out-perform conjugate/splitting integrators, as they combine the best of both worlds. However, we don't see this trend in Table 2, where we see Reduced OBA out-performing Conjguate OBA. The authors hypothesize \"this might be due to a sub-optimal choice of $B_t$\" -- I think this kind of explanation only confuses the readers, as it does not provide any guide on when we should and should not use conjugate splitting.\n- I think one factor that makes this paper confusing is the lack of theoretical results -- the authors rely mostly on numerical results to judge the performance of integrators. A theorem comparing, e.g., truncation error of proposed samplers would greatly improve the strength of the paper.\n\n**Weakness 2 : Incomplete / questionable baseline results**\n- The authors claim if $B_t = 0$, conjugate integrator is equivalent to DDIM. But, if we see Figure 2 (a), FID for DDIM ($\\lambda$-DDIM with $B_t = 0$) is too poor, compared to results in the original DDIM paper. For instance, in the original DDIM paper, DDIM achives FID 13.36 with NFE=10 while in Figure 2 (a), we see FID > 50.\n- Result for EDM + pre-conditioning is missing in Figure 5. Why do the authors add pre-conditioning for their methods, but not for EDM? Is it because EDM + pre-conditioning out-performs the proposed integrators? For instance, EDM + pre-conditioning achieves 1.97 FID with NFE=35, which beats the best result in this paper, 2.11 FID with NFE=100.\n\n**Weakness 3 : Incomplete evaluation**\n- Results on higher-dimensional data is missing. I would like to see additional results on $\\geq 512$ resolution images.\n- Results on conditional generation is missing. I would like to see additional results on e.g., class-conditional and text-conditional generation."

Please feel free to tell me if you have concerns about some of my suggestions!\n\nThis paper is based on a novel and fundamental idea, which has not been explored previously. I am supervised by the authors when they present their ideas, as it is a so fundamental and elegant formulation while I have not thought of it previously.\n\nThe authors propose to study the integral in a projected space, where the new variable has a stable homeomorphism with the original variable. Under this setting the original integral is equivalent to the new integral, while under careful design, the new integral could be much more easy and fast to compute. Almost all accelerating methods, as I can recall, can fit in this formulation, which means it can generally define the theory insights of all acceleration methods. It could be a good idea to simplify and extend the definition in this paper to a more generalized form. While this paper only considers linear projections, I think it is enough to cover most cases.\n\nThe authors then split the new integrals into multiple components, which earns further accelerations. The authors give enough discussions about the error analysis. Extensive studies on small datasets are used to fairly evaluate the proposed methods."

In my experience, in most cases, 25-step DPM-solver sampling could produce good enough sampling results for large models like StableDiffusions on large diverse image distribution; and less than 15-step DPM-solver sampling could produce good enough results for small diffusion models in small data domain. Please tell me if you observe a different phenomenon, and I will be happy to test it. Getting back to the subject, are the 100 and 50 NFEs considered by this paper a bit redundant?\n\n2. In eq 1, the authors actually simplify the original diffusion process to linear ones, and replace the f(z_t) function to linear map F_t z_t, so do please kindly mention that in the corresponding place. Otherwise, it may cause confusion. I care about the scope of this simplification, could it be applied to generation diffusion processes? Especially those in large-scale datasets and models? For example, \n\n3. The stability analysis seems to avoid the key points? I would like to know a two-phase conclusion: first, when will matrix A_t stability have an inverse, this is the key to the stable conjuncture; second, under the condition that A_t is inversible and stable, when will eq 7 and 8 as ODE solvers be stable? Theorem 2 seems like a naive application of ODE stability conditions, and gets rid of the key part. A_t is an integral of multiple components, so we may not directly assume it to be stably invertible. But you also do not assume it stable anyway (minimum eigenvalue larger than some positive constant). It would also be helpful if the authors could explain in what reality settings those conditions can be satisfied.\n\n4. Theorem 3 gives error analysis based on h, I have concerns about its error with respect to the original t. After the projection is to solve the original problem, measuring the error in a projected space could be less meaningful. This is the same problem in the DPM-Solver paper, they only analyze errors when lambda is stably transformed from t, but in reality is often not the case. But DPM-Solver performs great generally so I am not criticizing it. Just point out that error analysis with respect to t variable is preferred for typical ode numerical analysis.\n\n5. This work, also reminds me of the DPM-Solvers. DPM-Solver could be viewed as a special case, it also projects the integral to another space, the lambda space in fact. It uses a prediction-correction (PC) method to achieve much higher accuracy in the projected space. So I care about two things: first how the dpm-solver will formulate under your settings and when will your method outperform it? Second, can your method benefit from PC? While this work does not compare with DPM-Solver, considering the huge influences of and similarity with DPM-Solver, it could be better if the authors could compare with it.\n\n6. Improvements seem not to be good enough, especially considering speed. Large datasets and models are also not considered.\n\n\nSome minor things and suggestions include:\n1. I recommend using the ICLR official math notations, including in the original tex file, to express math concepts. For example, $dt$ should be $\\mathrm{d}t$, $\\bm{z}_t$ is better than $\\rv{z}_t$ in an ODE equation (and I also think is better in SDEs), and set A should be $\\mathcal{A}$.\n2.
