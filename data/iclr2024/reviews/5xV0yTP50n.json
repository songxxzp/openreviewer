Lack of discussion on related works. For one thing, the subgraph-based model should be carefully compared with enclosing subgraphs used in GraIL and CoMPILE. For another, the path-based model should be carefully compared with the path-based method NBFNet. The authors also indicate that NBFNet is very similar to the proposed model, but what are the key differences?\n\n3. The proposed method only performs the best in a few cases. The results on FB15K-237 and Nell-995 are claimed to be SOTA, but only a few numbers are the best. The relative gain is really marginal compared with the gap to the best when SiaILP is not the best.\n\n4. The design of relation embeddings is inspired by Word2vec, but word2vec is for words/nodes. The authors should talk more about this design.\n\n5. Lack of complexity analysis. It is well known that the number of paths can be large between two entities, so the running time comparison and complexity analysis are essential."

The model learns input and output relation embeddings (in addition to BiLSTM weights) and is applicable for inductive relation prediction tasks where entities at inference time can be new, but the set of relations is the same."

                "value": "**W1.** No scientific novelty - SiaILP is a rather brute-force approach that directly mines relational paths for each triple in each inference graph and applies standard BiLSTM for encoding the paths. When there are not enough paths (less than 3), the approach resorts to mining paths within the entity\u2019s subgraph. The authors do not provide any detail on the preprocessing time or memory requirements necessary for path mining for the benchmarked datasets. Generally, such brute-force mining of a hardcoded number of paths is always inferior to GNNs like NBFNet that capture _all_ possible paths thanks to the algorithmic alignment between GNNs and dynamic programming (such as the Bellman-Ford algorithm in NBFNet). \n\n**W2.** There is no motivation behind the design choices in SiaILP, e.g., why the model takes exactly 3 paths, why the decoder is a concatenation-MLP which is permutation-variant (i.e., a different order of the same aggregated 3 paths would return different results), why is there a need for an RNN. All the components seem to be chosen ad-hoc and leave an impression of a technical report of a quickly assembled ML course project.\n\n**W3.** The state-of-the-art claims are rather exaggerated - SiaILP only shows competitive (to the 2021 baselines) performance in the easiest relation prediction task $(h, ?, t)$ when there are at most 200 relations to rank in the benchmarked splits. Relation prediction is a rather trivial task that usually supports the main entity prediction $(h, r, ?)$ task, the actual KG completion. When it comes to the KG completion, SiaILP is evaluated on the toy setup of 50 random negatives (originally chosen because of the excessive computational complexity of GraIL) whereas modern approaches use evaluation on the full entity set (including NBFNet, RED-GNN [1], ReFactorGNNs [2]). Even in that toy entity ranking setup, SiaILP is mostly behind the old baselines (sometimes by a large margin).\n\nFollowing that, I would recommend reporting evaluation results on the full entity ranking (for both head and tail prediction) task. I suspect that due to the path mining and aggregation mechanism, all-entity ranking for SiaILP would take an enormous time that would render the approach inapplicable for any graph larger than those small GraIL splits.\n\nOverall, I do not see enough theoretical or experimental merits that would support the publication at ICLR.\n\n\n**Writing comments:**  \nThe paper contains rather strange wording in some parts:    \n* Abstract: \u201ctypologies\u201d -> topologies.  \n* Abstract: \u201crules \u2026 lack generosity\u201d -> lack generalization?   \n* Experimental results: \u201c... if the existing structure reaches an optimism\u201d -> optimum? Optimality?   \n\n\n**References:**  \n[1] Zhang et al. Knowledge graph reasoning with relational digraph. WebConf 2022.  \n[2] Chen et al.
