As for (i), Theorem 4.4 proves that, if two network inputs have small angle, then the model gradients become less and less aligned as the depth of the network increases. As for (ii), Theorems 5.2 and 5.3 show that the condition number of the NTK is smaller than that of the Gram matrix containing the inputs (meaning that the NTK is better conditioned). Specifically, Theorem 5.2 looks at the case in which we have only 2 data samples and shows that the condition number decreases with depth; Theorem 5.3 looks at an arbitrary non-degenerate dataset (i.e., inputs not aligned), considers the NTK of a two-layer network where the outer layer is not trained, and proves that the condition number of such NTK is smaller than the condition number of the Gram matrix of the input. All NTK results refer to the infinite width limit. For comparison, in a linear network, data separation and condition number of the NTK do not change with depth. The fact that the NTK is better conditioned has implications on optimization which are shown via numerical results on MNIST, f-MNIST and Librispeech (see Section 6). Numerical experiments also demonstrate the better separation and conditioning of ReLU networks (compared to linear networks)."

Other relevant parameters such as the input dimension $d$ and the number of samples $n$ are assumed to be constant (which is rather unrealistic in typical datasets). \n\nThe regime being restrictive is even more evident in the NTK results. Theorem 5.2 holds only for two data points. Theorem 5.3 holds for a general two layer network with the outer layer being fixed. However, it implicitly requires that the input dimension $d$ is bigger than the number of samples $n$. In fact, if that's not the case, $G$ is not full rank, and the statement becomes trivial (as the smallest eigenvalue of $G$ is $0$, and it is well known that the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK is bounded away from $0$). Note that having $d>n$ is violated in all the experiments of Section 5. Actually, the numbers reported in Figure 2(b) when $L=0$ are a bit suspicious. I would expect the condition number to be $\\infty$ since $G$ has at most rank $d$. Or am I missing something here?"

I applaud the authors for studying Equation (7) and (8) as they are challenging objects. However, the current results (Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.4) are only considering the points that are very close to each other $\\Theta(x,z) = o(1/L)$ and if $L$ is big, this quantity is very small. As the authors mentioned, for small $z$, $g(z)$ behaves like identity. Thus, although Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.4 is able to show that ReLU improves the data separability, the improvement is also very small in the regime the authors are considering in this paper. Thus, the model gradient angles are nearly non-changing from the input angles. This is also why the improvement for the condition number in Theorem 5.2 can also be very small. It would be more interesting to see ReLU can improve data separability for input pair with small angle (but larger than the regime this paper presents). Further, although Proposition 5.1 is able to connect the model gradient angle with the upper bound of the smallest eigenvalue and the lower bound of condition number, it is also not clear how tight the upper bound is. \n\n[1] Arora, Sanjeev, et al. \"On exact computation with an infinitely wide neural net.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 32 (2019)."
