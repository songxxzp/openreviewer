The paper considers an extension where a player is partially controlled by the attacker and follows the original policy with a certain probability and the malicious policy otherwise. The paper derives some analytic results regarding the effects of attack budget on attack detectability. It then formulates the victim's problem of minimizing the one-side exploitability, proposes two algorithms, and establishes their convergence."

Both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 follow the general framework for finding the Stackelberg equilibrium in deep multi-agent RL summarized in Gerstgrasser et al. (2023). The convergence analysis of the two-timescale approach follows Daskalakis et al. (2020) and Zeng et al. (2022). Thus, the technical contribution of the paper seems limited. \n\nThe paper assumes that the original policy \\hat{\\pi}_alpha of the agent partially controlled by the attacker is fixed so that existing algorithmic and analytic frameworks can be applied. However, this is not a reasonable assumption. Since the agent is playing a game with the victim (even without the attacker), it should adapt its (original) policy against the victim's policy rather than using a fixed policy. \n\nIn Section 3, since the victim's policy is assumed to be fixed, the problem reduces to a single agent MDP, and Propositions 3.1-3.3 are simple variants of well-known results in approximate dynamic programming. Also, I don't see the purpose of mentioning concepts such as generative modeling and distribution matching.  \n\nMatthias Gerstgrasser and David C. Parkes.

They are just different types of attacks. In the air traffic control example, what is the Markov game between the radar system and the commercial drone? \n\nAlthough it makes sense to consider a constrained attack model to obtain better stealthiness, the proposed formulation is a bit confusing. In particular, if the agent is only partially controlled by the attacker, there is a three-player game between the victim, the agent partially controlled by the attacker, and the attacker.  In this case, why should the agent adopt a fixed policy without adapting to the victim's policy? \n\nIn Figure 1, it says that an unconstrained adversarial policy and a constrained policy with the same winning rate are chosen. How is this achieved? Also, is the same victim policy used in both cases? Intuitively, a smaller epsilon should produce a lower state distribution shift and a stealthier attack, but at the same time, the victim's (best possible) performance should improve, given that the attacker becomes weaker."

The paper derives a bound on policy discrepancy given p and investigates the stealthiness of an attack for a given p, where stealthiness is defined either as variation in the induced state distribution or as variation in the conditional transition dynamics. The paper then investigates adversarial training with timescale separation to achieve provably robust victim policies and derives a convergence bound that is polynomial with respect to the size of the state and action space. The paper then verifies the stealthiness of the proposed attack and the exploitability of robustified victim policies in two benchmark environments."

(2019). \n\nThe motivation of the attack budget and partial control is not enough convincing. From the attack side, it is true that the setting of attack budget can improve the stealthiness, but it is hard to say that the proposed attack is optimal subject to the limitation of the discrepancy between the state distributions (or marginalized transition dynamics). From the side of the defense (adversarial training), there is no insight into the choice of the defense budget which is the budget used to train the robust victim. What is the benefit of introducing this defense budget? More discussion would be helpful.\n\nThe result in Figure 1 is confusing. 1. Why the bottom-right subfigure is empty? 2. Is original state distribution means that the distribution without any attack? If it is true, should not the original state distribution be same in the bottom and top subfigures? The original state distributions in top-mid and bottom-mid subfigures are different. Could you explain the reason? 3. Where do the results in Figure 1 come from? The paper only mentions that two attack polices are assessed under the same winning rate. However, according to the Figure 6, the unconstrained policy has higher wining rate."
