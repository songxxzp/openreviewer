It finetunes the pre-trained model in the target dataset and is evaluated in the target dataset. In [A], they claim to be robust in generalization as it is not finetuned in the target dataset.\n\n- The ablation study is not well-written. It is difficult to follow the decision process of each module (DSF & MLDC). It is better to focus on each module separately. It is recommended to follow Table 2 in [A] to show better ablation study. It is unclear why the softmax normalization is replaced by Sigmoid function to validate the long range dependencies. Wouldn't it better to remove the MDLC module for the ablation study as in Exp3?\n\n- The goal of the specific IB is to perform the deep supervision in the lower resolution so that the distribution of the lower-level cost volume can be supervised by the distribution of ground truth disparity. The idea of deep supervision is not new because it has been done in [B] as well. However, it is unclear how the proposed additional supervised loss can lead to better performance. \n\n- The performance improvement seems to be incremental, while the justification of the proposed method is lacking due to unclear experimental results. More exhaustive ablation study is required to justify the performance, especially comparison with various layer fusion methods, global and local attention stereo matching methods.\n\n- The motivation of the problem is unclear. There is no experimental based justification that the current stereo matching method performance is insufficient due to lack inductive bias in the network design. Selecting the state-of-the-art methods and showing the problem quantitatively might be better approach to show the motivation. \n\nAdditional references\n- [A] Domain Generalized Stereo Matching via Hierarchical Visual Transformation, CVPR 2023\n- [B] CFNet: Cascade and Fused Cost Volume for Robust Stereo Matching, CVPR 2021"

                "value": "The paper developed a model named UStereo to introduce the general IB to stereo matching. It adopt inter-layer fusion to break down volume-level scale invariance to a recurrence strategy in initialization for information at low resolution and refinement process for the high, which further extends to capture long-range dependencies after shallow stacks of convolutions and normalization without time-consuming Transformers. Additionally, to reveal the role that the volume structure constructed by specific IB plays during inference, it proposed the first-time in-depth study of volume at low resolution through varying degrees of restraint as well as 3 original statistic indicators to reflect the characteristics of representation within volumes."
