First the marginal likelihood comparison with other methods, are the PhyloGFN better in terms of lower bound and what is the running time required to get these results. Second, regarding the better estimates of posterior probabilities for low posterior  phylogenetic tree (which may be the main selling point for this paper), what is the gold standard and how does your running time compare with that of he gold standard and those of the other methods? Running time doesn't have to be measured as wall-clock or using a formal analysis, but could be based on the number of so-called Felsenstein peeling operations (or whatever that make it likely that this approach may with sufficient effort yield a efficient method in the future, if that isn't already the case). The proper resolution of these issues should make this become a good contribution."

See my question below. \n\n * Likewise, the paper would be more readable by the machine learning community if the used tree-level features are explained. As far as I was able to detect, the main paper mentions only that they are Fitch and Felsenstein features, which may be obvious to an evolutionary biologist but they do not tell anything to me as a machine learning researcher. Now that this is not a biology journal but a machine learning research venue, an introduction to such basic concepts somewhere in the paper could be beneficial.\n\n * The paper reports log-likelihood results, which measures model fit. It measures parsimony, which appears to be about the computational aspect. The log densities reported in Figure 2 is an indicator of diversity. It may be better to have a more direct and interpretable score of the discovery performance, for instance prediction accuracy of evolution tree links or ancestral relationship detection between pairs of species in cases where there is agreement on the ground truth.

These problems have recently seen a lot of development in the machine learning space with a flurry of variational approaches.  The novelty in this paper is framing the problem as a Markov Decision Problem, where one needs to sequentially build a tree from the bottom up by joining the roots of rooted trees (starting with each leaf being its own rooted tree with one node).  This paper tries to learn a good policy for the MDP (i.e., a generative model for building trees) using the recently developed GFlowNets.  The paper puts some effort into finding provably good features to use when learning the policy, and showing that the optimal policy would, in fact, result in a distribution over trees equivalent to the posterior.  The authors apply their approach to a number of standard benchmarking datasets and find reasonable performance, particularly for low probability tree topologies."

As the authors note, taking $K \\to \\infty$ in equation (5) or the log of (S1)results in the true MLL regardless of the distribution used.  For finite $K$, both the bias and variance of the estimated MLL will depend on the learned posterior and it is incredibly difficult for me to compare methods.  For example in Table 1, on DS7, GeoPhy is bolded for having the smallest mean MLL, but its standard error is huge, which suggests to me that by some measures it may not have learned a very good posterior.  Is there a different task that could get at the quality of the posterior in a more interpretable way?\n* I also find it somewhat surprising how much VBPI-GNN outperforms PhyloGFN on the MLL estimation task.\n* Saying that VBPI-GNN is \"severely\" limited in its applicability to postulating alternative phylogenetic theories feels like far too strong of a statement, especially in light of Table 2 -- for trees with non-negligible posterior probability VBPI-GNN is quite accurate.  I agree that VBPI being unable to put mass on all of tree space is conceptually displeasing, but I don't think the presented evidence supports the claim that VBPI would result in any real-world failures of inference.\n* Are the axes flipped on Figure 2? If I understand correctly the x-axis should be the unnormalized posterior under the long run of MrBayes, and the y-axis is the unnormalized posterior for either GFN or VBPI.  Why do the points fall on different x-axis ranges for the two columns but very similar y-axis ranges?  (Similarly for Figure S1)\n* It would be nice to include some information about runtime and to include some training curves.  Are these models difficult to train?  How sensitive is training to the choice of distribution over $\\tau$?  Etc...\n\nTypos:\n* \"Given a set of observed sequence\" --> \"Given a set of observed sequences\"\n* \"Each action chooses a pair of trees and join them\" --> \"Each action chooses a pair of trees and joins them\"\n* Is it important or a typo in Proposition 1, Lemma 1, and Lemma 2 that only the branch lengths of the first tree are different?  I.e., it is $(z_1, b_1)$ and $(z_1', b_1')$ but then $(z_2, b_2)$ and $(z_2', b_2)$ and so on.  I don't see that used anywhere.\n* In the statement of Lemma 1 I believe it should be $(b(e_{uv}), b(e_{uw}))$ not $(b(e_{uv}), (b(e_{uv}))$.\n* This sentence needs substantial rewording: \"Note that $R(x) \\ne R(x') even $s_1$ and $s_2$ share the same Fitch feature because two trees can have different parsimony score when their root level Fitch feature equals.\"\n* In the proof of proposition 2, I believe that one must multiply by $\\frac{\\exp \\frac{\\sum_i M(z_i)}{T}}{\\exp \\frac{\\sum_i M(z_i)}{T}}$, not $\\frac{\\frac{\\sum_i M(z_i)}{T}}{\\frac{\\sum_i M(z_i)}{T}}$.\n* At the bottom of the first paragraph on p. 17 should it be $-\\log P(\\mathbf{Y} | z,b) P(b)$ not $-\\log P(\\mathbf{Y} | z,b) P(z)$ in order to match what is in the reward function?\n* \"ground-trueth\" --> \"ground-truth\""

                "value": "* I am being a bit of a devil's advocate here, and it is a minor point, but, who cares about extremely unlikely trees?  Difference in log-likelihood on Figure 2 suggests that the trees with lowest posterior support are about $10^{-66}$ less likely than the trees with highest posterior support.  Does saying that those trees have zero probability really matter? Is there a real world use-case where knowing the posterior probability of those trees more accurately would be useful?\n* Would it be possible to use the machinery presented in this paper just for topologies in the Bayesian setting by somehow marginalizing out branch lengths at each step?  This is obviously not necessary for the present manuscript, I am just curious.\n* A preprint that was posted shortly after the ICLR deadline is highly relevant: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09553.  Since that was posted after the ICLR deadline, it did not influence my review of this paper.  The method in that preprint, ARTree, is based on reinforcement learning and also seeks to learn a posterior via framing a tree as the outcome of sequential tree building.  Yet, the training objectives and MDP formulation are substantially different, and so I do not see ARTree as reducing in any way the novelty of the present work.  I just bring this up in the hopes that it is interesting/helpful to the authors."

                "value": "The paper presents an application of GFlowNets for phylogenetic inference. The approach encompasses both Bayesian posterior inference and parsimony-based inference (MLE with the assumption of site independence). To address the continuous nature of branch lengths, they are transformed into discrete bins, making the phylogenetic inference problem discrete. GFlowNets are parameterized by neural networks, teaching them a policy to generate phylogenetic trees by selecting and connecting pairs of subtrees. With its probabilistic policy, the system can produce a distribution of phylogenetic trees suitable for posterior inference. In the MLE scenario, the model employs a temperature parameter that, when annealed, ensures the GFlowNet samples align with the MLE samples. The training of GFlowNets utilizes standard trajectory balance. The results suggest that the approach matches the performance of variational inference-based methods for Bayesian posterior inference, and in the MLE case, it is comparable to traditional greedy heuristic-based search algorithms."
