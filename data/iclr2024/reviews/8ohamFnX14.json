It seems we agree that beliefs of finite depth are important.\" No, I'm claiming the opposite. Belief about belief about beliefs to finite depths are not useful and are misleading. The infinite limit (equilibrium) is useful, but as in the link I provided above, stopping at any finite depth often gives beliefs that are a function of the depth, not of anything else.  Beliefs about actions are imperative for intelligent action and AI, but that is not the same.\n\n(I am not objecting to you claiming they are useful, I am objecting to you asserting they are useful without any evidence.  I'm also not clear why a category theory formalization is useful. Also, it isn't really relevant to ICLR.)\n\nIn another answer you said there wasn't a recent literature. Monte Carlo tree search (as, e.g., used in AlphaZero) can be seen as stochastic simulation through the space of belief about beliefs (where the beliefs are about the *actions* of the other agent); one reason it works is that it does not stop at an arbitrary point, but goes to the end of the episode/game. Also, (depending on what you mean by recent) Joe Halpern of Cornell has written many papers on this topic. A quick look found https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/abstract.html#journal67"

The Nash equilibrium has a maximization step (agent agent has a utility it is trying to maximize), which seems essential to the running example, but doesn't  appear in the paper. (One of) the brilliance(s) of Nash's result is that an agent does not need to do the recursive reasoning that this paper is about. We can compute the fixed point directly.\n\nThe rest of the running example is all nonsense. \"In order for Bob to generate his own strategy, he must consider what he knows...\" is not true.

Besides this, the paper shows connections between these two settings, ans well as relations with a setting of index-dependent distributions.\nThe authors end their paper with some examples of specific structures, with an summary of how to compute the distance in a simple 3-state game, and with an overview of related work."

Does the metric space {\\cal X} contain distributions?\n- If not, can we always assume that n\u22651? Why?\n- If so, that is a structural assumption on {\\cal X} that seems strange, and needs to be spelled out.\nIt could be that I misunderstand something here. What could improve my understanding, is having the answer to the following question: What is the form of the equivalence class that contains an element of {\\cal X}?\n\n2/ page 5, Lemma 6: The authors don't prove that the alleged metric is positive definite (that W(mu,nu)>0 if mu\u2260nu). I believe that this is a requirement of the usual definition of a metric. Do the authors need this? If so, does their map W satisfy this?\n\nI conclude my review with a list of some small remarks and typos:\n\npage 1, first paragraph following the abstract: \"... to sequences of beliefs quantify uncertainty ...\" should read something like \"... to sequences of beliefs that quantify uncertainty ...\" (so sets with a \"that\", or an alternative).\n\npage 1, second paragraph: There is a dot missing after the third sentence.\n\npage 1, fourth paragraph: \"... one must play of the three options.\" should read \"... one must play one of the three options.\".\n\npage 1, fifth paragraph: \"geoemtric\" should read \"geometric\". In the following sentence, the word \"gives\" is superfluous.\n\npage 2, paragraph following Theorem 1: \"Parts (2)--(6)\" should be \"Parts (2)--(5)\", I believe, since there are only 5 parts in Theorem 1.\n\npage 3, Lemma 3: In the proof, the authors use a result that guarantees that each {\\cal P}^m({\\cal X}) is T1 if {\\cal X} is T1. While I can believe this is true, I would like to have a proof. Is this a standard \nresult? If so, it might be worth giving a reference.\n\npage 3, Lemma 5: Its proof appears in the supplementary material as well as in the paper; perhaps the copy in the paper can be omitted?\n\npage 4, proof of Theorem 4: Theorem 1 part (4) talks about *compact* spaces, and not about the weaker notion of *paracompact* spaces. Why can this be inferred? If that's not immediate, perhaps it suffices for the \nfurther applications that the spaces are compact, in addition to being paracompact?\n\npage 5, Lemma 6: There is a dot missing at the end of the lemma.\n\npage 5, right hand side of Equation (10): the part of the expression after | is not a condition, which reads a bit strangely. I suggest that the authors add that \\tilde\\nu \\in the sets shown, if that's correct.\n\npage 5, Equation (11): Why is does \\Delta^i commute with \\bigcap and \\bigcup? This must be some standard result, but I don't seem to find a reference for this.\n\npage 6, Lemma 11: The authors should define the map ev already here, as they use it in their commuting diagram. Now they only define the map ev later on in Section 2.\n\npage 8, subsection \"Competitive/Cooperative games\": There is a dot lacking between the first two sentences. Also, \"In this sense, both agents beliefs ...\" should read \"In this sense, both agents' beliefs ...\"."
