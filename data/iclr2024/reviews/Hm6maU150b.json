Inspired by the interpretation, that models with skip connections can be seen as ODEs, the authors argue that it is reasonable to remove some residual blocks, as skipping some steps in solving ODEs. \nThe motivation is valid and interesting. \n\n**2**, Experiments cover different sub-model methods. \n\nThe author compared NeFL with both depth scaling and width scaling methods. The results show promising results."

For instance, why scaling both width and depth is better than scaling one dimension only?\n\n\n**2**, Lack of contributions.\n\nEssentially, NeFL is a combination of width-scaling (e.g., HeteroFL) and depth-scaling (e.g., DepthFL). Other than that, I did not see a nontrivial contribution in this work. \nImportantly, it is doubtful such a combination can bring significant improvement over prior works."
