Even though fairness has been a widely studied topic in federated learning and many earlier works have discussed that, it remains a major challenge to design an FL algorithm that both improves the global (final) model performance and guarantees fairness. The authors tackled the challenge by modifying the aggregation rule via a method inspired by entropy, a central notion in information theory."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The algorithm may have flaws: \n- The communication overhead appears to be much higher than FedAvg in Algorithm 1.  According to Line 3  and Line 9,  clients need to communicate with the server twice at each round t. This contradicts the traditional FedAvg that only communicates once at each round. \n- In Line 9, $\\tilde{g}^t$ is the fair gradient of the selected clients obtained using one local update. However, there is no step before line 9 that collects the one local update from clients. The authors should clarify this process.  \n-  In algorithm 1, Line 10  indicates that Eq 3 will use the local model $x_{t,K}^j$ as $x$ to calculate the $p_j$. However, using local model $x_{t,K}^j$ for Eq 3 leads to different denominators $\\sum_{i=1}^N \\exp[F_i(x_{t,K}^j)/\\tau]$ for different client $j$. Then $p_j$ for different clients is not normalized by the same denominator.  I am not sure how it satisfies the constraint  $\\sum_j p_j=1$ in Eq 2. An explanation of how this approach satisfies the constraint would be helpful.\n\n\n\nWriting: \n- Although the high-level idea is communicated well, the mathematical presentation could be improved for better accessibility. The paper's current use of a complex and inconsistent notation system hampers understanding.   For example, it seems that the notations, $\\nabla \\tilde{f}(x)$, $\\tilde{\\Delta}_t$,  and $\\tilde{g}^t$ are interchangeably used to represent the FedSGD global gradient,  (e.g., the aggregation of one-step local updates) in different sections, causing confusion. \n- It would be clearer if the authors could connect Eq 8 and Eq 10 to Eq 6, given that they share a similar form and intuition. For example, Eq 6 is not referenced in Section 4.2.2, thus making the purpose of Equation 10 unclear.\n\n- The motivation of maximum entropy for fairness may need further clarification.  Though the authors discussed fairness in the introduction and mentioned the Shannon entropy in Section 4.1, the connection between entropy and fairness is not intuitively clear. More explicit reasoning or examples illustrating why higher entropy equates to greater fairness would be beneficial, especially in federated learning settings.\n\n- From equation (2),  the term \u201cideal loss\u201d $\\tilde{f}(x)$ is introduced without a clear definition or expression, leading to confusion that is not resolved until later sections (4.2.1 and 4.2.2).  It would be beneficial if the authors could provide more discussion or examples for  \u201cideal loss\u201d here. \n\n\nClarification: \n\n- The fairness of FedEBA+ is partly achieved based on the assumption that the FedSGD global gradient is an ideal fair gradient. Specifically, according to the end of Section 4.2, the authors view a FedSGD global gradient as the ideal global gradient and the ideal fair gradient. Clarity is needed on why this assumption is made and whether the FedSGD gradient truly encapsulates ideal fairness.  Also, it would be helpful to consider FedSGD as one fairness baseline in the experiments, to demonstrate the effect of another component in FedEBA+, maximum entropy aggregation, for fairness. \n\n\n- The following statement is not clear: \u201cThe specific challenge lies in finding a way to introduce entropy into the FL training process while incorporating FL\u2019s uniform performance as a constraint within the framework.\u201d  Isn\u2019t maximum entropy encouraging uniform performance? (Intuitively,  the outcomes with uniform probability give the highest entropy, i.e., uncertainty, based on the definition of entropy)  Does maximum entropy go against the goal of uniform performance? The reason why these concepts are treated distinctly in this statement requires clarification. \n\nTheory: \n- The claimed convergence rate is not appropriate because there is a non-vanishing constant error term, which means that the gradient of the algorithm will never approach zero. The convergence rate is O(1) instead. This finding is inconsistent with previous studies, such as FedAvg convergence under the non-iid setting [1], which does not have the constant error term. \n\n- The Theorem 5.3 claims that FedEBA+ achieves a smaller variance than FedAvg. However, the effect of FL data distributions is not reflected in Theorem 5.3. It would be clearer if the authors could justify how non-iid degree will affect the fairness results. Moreover, could the authors provide definitions for T() and A() in the variance analysis?\n\nExperiments: \n- The algorithms introduce a few additional hyperparameters: temperature $\\tau$, angle threshold $\\theta$, and $\\alpha$. From Figure 4, it appears that the performance of the algorithm is quite sensitive to the hyperparameters, and different datasets have different optimal hyperparameters. It indicates a need for extensive hyperparameter tuning across different datasets. This requirement potentially reduces the algorithm's practicality compared to more straightforward federated learning algorithms like FedAvg.\n- The influence of the angle threshold $\\theta$ on FedEBA+'s performance is not demonstrated. It would be beneficial to provide an ablation study on  $\\theta$.\n\n\nReference:\n\n[1] On the Convergence of FedAvg on Non-IID Data, ICLR 2020"
