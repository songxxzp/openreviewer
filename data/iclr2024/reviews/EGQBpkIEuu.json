                "value": "This paper presents an analysis of various data augmentation techniques applied in image-based deep reinforcement learning.  \nThe authors classify these techniques into two primary categories: implicit and explicit data augmentation where implicit DA consists of directly applying transformations on the observations during training, oppositely to explicit DA where transformations are applied on samples used for an auxiliary regularization term.  \nFollowing this classification, the authors then put forth a generalized formulation for integrating DA within actor-critic methods, covering both the previously mentioned implicit and explicit DA techniques. One of the paper's most salient contributions lies in the analysis of how DA impacts the variance associated with the actor and critic losses.  \nThe insights drawn from this analysis guide the authors towards designing a principled data augmentation strategy.  \nA notable aspect of their proposed method is the integration of a computer vision regularization called tangent prop into the learning objective for the critic. This modification is suggested to potentially improve the stability and efficiency of the learning process.  \nThe experimental segment of the paper includes tests on the DeepMind control suite benchmark to evaluate the proposed data augmentation scheme. Additionally, the authors test the generalization capabilities of their method using the dmcontrol-generalization-benchmark."

This holistic approach serves to streamline various data augmentation techniques within the context of reinforcement learning.\n\n **Analysis on KL regularization direction:** The paper offers a commendable examination regarding the optimal direction for applying the KL regularization term. While the theoretical insights are appreciated, an empirical evaluation would have added further depth to this assessment.\n\n **Variance Analysis in SAC:** The comprehensive analysis of the variance associated with the different terms used in SAC when DA is applied is insightful and sparks intriguing questions that could guide future research in the domain.\n\n**Tangent Prop regularization:** Although the tangent prop regularization has its roots in the computer vision world and might not be a groundbreaking addition to RL, its introduction in this context is promising.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**Oversimplified Unified Framework:** While the proposed unified framework is a step forward, it seems overly simplified. Specifically, the representation of implicit data augmentation as solely reliant on KL regularization seems limiting. Other methods like SODA [1] and SGQN [2] incorporate data augmentation using auxiliary objectives, drawing parallels with techniques in self-supervised learning. Such nuances should have been addressed for a more comprehensive overview.\n\n**Excessive Reference to Appendix:** The frequent deference to the appendix, especially in sections 5.2 and 6, detracts from the paper's flow. Readers are forced into continuous back-and-forth toggling, making the narrative harder to follow.\n\n**Unverified Claims:** The assertion that introducing image transformations in the target doesn't lead to significant variance seems unsupported, particularly when considering table 5 in the appendix. Such claims should ideally be substantiated with empirical evidence.\n\n**Comparison with RAD and SVEA:** In the original paper, SVEA, which does not employ data augmentation on the target, significantly outperforms RAD. A comment or analysis from the authors on this discrepancy would have been informative.\n\n**Unclear Table Presentation:** Table 4 in the appendix is a bit perplexing. The logic behind measuring variance in relation to augmentations not employed during SVEA training (such as overlay, randomconv, rotation, or blur) is unclear. Additionally, the specific \"DA\" used here is not explicitly mentioned, leading to further confusion.\n\n**Novelty and Contribution:** A major point of contention is the actual novelty and impact of the paper's contributions. Its principal contribution seems to revolve around the unified framework and the introduction of tangent prop in RL. Yet, the proposed principled algorithm appears to be a minor extension of DrQ by merely incorporating a KL term. Based on figures 1 and 2, the tangible benefits seem largely attributed to the tangent prop, emphasizing its crucial role. While integrating this regularization in RL is commendable, its novelty in the broader context appears somewhat limited.\n \n**Minor comments**\n Bolding in Tables: The rationale behind the use of bolding in tables (specifically tables 4 and 5) needs clarification. \nLimitations are located in the appendix these and should be explicitly referenced in the main body.\nMissing legend in figure 7, what is the green line?"

                "value": "* Based on the data from Table 2, RAD+ exhibits lower variance on the critic loss compared to DrQ. Yet, it underperforms DrQ in terms of overall results. Given that both methods utilize the SAC algorithm, this seems to counter the claim made by the authors that reducing critic loss variance leads to more stabilized training. Can the authors provide insights or explanations for this observation?\n\n* My understanding is that the only discernible difference between the authors' method and DrQ+KL is the introduction of the tangent prop regularization. Drawing from Table 1, it appears that this regularization is the primary factor that reduces the critic loss variance, rather than the authors' generic algorithm. Could the authors comment on the role and impact of tangent prop in this context?\n\n* The authors assert that employing random convolution in SVEA doesn't induce significant variance. However, the empirical results from Table 5 seem to suggest otherwise. Could the authors clarify?\n\n* What drives the intuition that the KL term assists in reducing the variance of the target critic?\n\nFor a more comprehensive analysis, would it be feasible for the authors to include SVEA in the experiments of the initial experimental setup?"

                "value": "Originality:\nIt conducts a comprehensive analysis of existing data augmentation methods, initially based on the author's introduction of assumptions regarding uncertainty in reinforcement learning and existing image-based online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) data augmentation techniques. The paper establishes an integrated AC framework incorporating data augmentation. Within this framework, the mainstream data augmentation methods are analyzed and categorized into explicit and implicit regularization techniques. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of these augmentation methods are performed. Building upon these two types of regularization, the paper introduces a novel regularization technique \u2013 tangent prop \u2013 providing theoretical support for addressing uncertainty in the Critic component.\n\nQuality and Clarity:\nI think the quality of the paper is very high. Each proposition and hypothesis presented in the paper is accompanied by corresponding formulas, and the appendix contains detailed derivations of these formulas. Additionally, I find the paper to be very logically structured.\nFirst, the paper explains the process of the Data-Augmented Off-policy Actor-Critic Scheme and introduces the key hypotheses regarding the uncertainty in Q-values and policy \u03c0. The subsequent proofs and derivations are based on these definitions. The paper then elaborates on how explicit and implicit uncertainties are defined within the A-C framework and how they affect the Loss function of Actor and Critic. After providing the theoretical background, the paper proposes its own generic algorithm and provides detailed derivations and proofs.\n\nFurthermore, the paper analyzes the effects of applying different image transformations when calculating target Q-values, as well as the empirical actor/critic losses estimated under data augmentation. In implicit regularization, the author, unlike the previous SVEA method, incorporates KL divergence into the training process for policy. The paper explains and proves that, under the premise of Critic invariance, introducing KL divergence helps the model better learn the invariance of the Actor. Finally, the paper introduces the innovative concept of Tangent Propagation to further demonstrate how this newly introduced additional regularization term promotes Critic invariance.\n\nThe logic throughout the main body of the paper is very clear. It systematically proves its hypotheses about uncertainty and effectively addresses the initial problems posed in the paper.\n\nSignificance:\nThe paper holds significant value for the DRL research community. By offering a theoretical framework and introducing a novel regularization approach, the paper addresses a key challenge in DRL, enhancing the understanding and application of data augmentation techniques. The experimental validation across various environments supports the significance of the proposed methods. The findings are likely to influence future research directions, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field."

                "value": "The theoretical derivation in the paper is very thorough. However, I believe the experimental section of the paper is somewhat lacking. It compares the performance with the previous statistically trained model, SVEA, providing detailed experimental data and theoretical analysis. Nevertheless, there is a lack of in-depth analysis of the shortcomings of the previous algorithms and the advantages of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, I think the algorithm should be further compared with more methods and applied in various domains to validate its generalizability.\n\nThe entire article is dedicated to theoretically proving the reliability of its algorithm, and it has obtained favorable experimental results. However, throughout the entire text, there is no discussion about the shortcomings and limitations of the algorithm, nor is there any mention of how to extend the algorithm or areas that need further exploration in the future.\n\nThe article discusses how different complex image augmentation techniques have varying impacts on the invariance of target Q-values. The paper proposes using cosine similarity measured from encoder outputs for this evaluation. It is mentioned in the article that techniques such as random addition or Gaussian blur easily achieve invariance through these transformations because they result in high cosine similarity. When using these types of image transformations in computing target values, it does not affect performance. In contrast, image transformations like random convolution or random rotation are relatively challenging to achieve invariance during the training process, as they result in lower cosine similarity. The solution proposed in the paper is to enforce this invariance by performing more updates at each training step. However, the paper does not address whether there might be potential overfitting issues under these specific conditions and how to handle them."
