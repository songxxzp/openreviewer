                "value": "The authors propose a novel method to control generation process by diffusion models using arbitrary guidance functions without any retraining. The proposed method comprises two types of guidance: forward guidance and backward guidance. In the forward guidance, an estimated clean data is used to compute the guidance function, and its gradient is directly employed to adjust the estimated noise at each timestep. On the other hand, in the backward guidance, the adjustment is obtained by multiple step gradient descent, which leads to more faithful results to the constraint incurred by the guidance. The exprimental results show that the proposed method works well across various types of guidance."

This approach is quite similar to that employed in DPS and FreeDoM [R1]. \n  - In addition, the stepwise refinement is also similar to time-travel strategy in FreeDoM.\n    - [R1] \"FreeDoM: Training-Free Energy-Guided Conditional Diffusion Model,\" ICCV 2023.\n\n- The advantage of the proposed method over existing methods is not clear. The experiments lack comparison with baseline methods, though several related studies are refered in Section 2. Specifically, Diffusion Posterior Sampling (and FreeDoM as well) is closely related to this work and should be compared qualitatively and quantitatively.\n\n\n<Minor ones>\n\n- As any kind of guidance function can be used in the proposed method, it would be interesting to see how its performance varies according to the design of the guidance function. For example, in the case of segmentation map guidance, we may have a lot of publicly-available segmentation models that can be utilized for the guidance. In this case, can we simply choose the best performing model? This point is not clear in the manuscript, because only single model is examined for each conditional generation task."

To solve the problem, it proposes to add a loss gradient term to the denoising score function. Let c be the guidance that is the output of some function c=f(z0) for the unknown sample z0. Then the loss is defined to be defined between c and f(\\hat{z}), where \\hat{z} is an estimate for the z0 based on noisy observation zt based on MMSE estimation. This approximation has been commonly used in the diffusion literature e.g., in DDIM, DPS [Chung et al\u201922 ], PGDM [Song et al\u201922]. Experiments show that this loss-guidance works to properly guide stable diffusion sampling. \n\n[Song et al\u201922] Song, Jiaming, Arash Vahdat, Morteza Mardani, and Jan Kautz. \"Pseudoinverse-guided diffusion models for inverse problems.\" In International Conference on Learning Representations. 2022.\n\n[Chung et al\u201922 ] Chung, Hyungjin, Jeongsol Kim, Michael T.

I think it is needed to include an experiment to support this claim. In addition, only \"object location guidance\" in Sec 4.2 provided the ablation of forward and backward guidance, the results for at least more than one tasks are helpful. \n\n* I appreciate the experiments on conditional stable diffusion in Sec4.1 and unconditional imagenet diffusion in Sec 4.2. However, I am curious why not also conducting segmentation map guidance in 4.2. I think including same task in both 4.1 and 4.2 can be helpful for readers to understand the differences between the two diffusion models. \n\n* My primary concern is: all presented visual results are not diverse - dogs are everywhere. I also checked all results in the supplemental, it is similar. How about other cases?"
