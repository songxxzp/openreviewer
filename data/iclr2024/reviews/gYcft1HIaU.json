Someone seeking to use this evaluation method may need to consult expert opinion themselves, just to calibrate the alignment scores. The motivation behind the linear combination of BLEU-1, ROUGE-1 and cosine sim is empirically driven and is not inherently convincing as a metric."

The experiments are exclusively conducted in Chinese. However, this critical detail is not adequately emphasized in the main paper, particularly in their conclusion that \"none of the evaluated LLMs have mastered sufficient knowledge to handle real clinical problems effectively.\" Based on their evaluation, the valid conclusion should be that LLMs do not possess adequate clinical knowledge **in the Chinese language**, and this finding cannot be generalized to other languages.\n\n2. In the second paragraph of the introduction, the authors claim that current QA-based medical evaluation datasets cannot evaluate whether LLMs have mastered sufficient medical knowledge because those datasets cover only some common diseases. It would be more robust if the authors could further justify this statement with some analysis (e.g. to quantitatively show the coverage of diseases in the existing benchmarks).\n\n3. For the proposed knowledge base MedDisK, it would be better for authors to include more details of the construction process. For example, how is the agreement among the clinical experts, is there any strategy used to tackle disagreement, and will this process introduce any additional human bias?\n\n4. In section 3.2.1, the authors \"employ a specialized NER model to identify and extract medical entities from the text\". However, the exact name and citation of the used NER model are missing, and it will be more convincing to include an analysis of the accuracy of the NER model as incorrectly recognized entities could impact the evaluation results of LLMs."

However, in section 3.1 where the authors introduce their proposed knowledge base, it is said that \"We first select a subset from the ICD10 database according to whether the diseases are common in clinical (determined by clinical experts) and are statistically frequent in EHR (Electronic Health Record), resulting in 10,632 common diseases.\" I wonder why they also consider common diseases in their knowledge base?\n\n2. In the section of \"Disease-Knowledge-based Automated Scoring\", are there any better metrics to evaluate the similarity? The token-level BLEU-1 and ROUGE-1 cannot consider semantic meaning, and the M3E model is described as a sentence-level metric, whereas the evaluation in this context focuses on the meaning of individual tokens.\n\n3. In Table 3, one completely wrong example of LLM response is \"ok, I see\". Since the authors mention that they employ a specialized NER model to identify and extract medical entities from the text, I wonder why the NER model could extract such words from the responses.\n\n4. In section 4.2.2, the authors assign scores of 0, 5, and 10 to \u201dCompletely Wrong,\u201d \u201dPartially Correct,\u201d and \u201dBasically Correct,\u201d respectively, to calculate a total score.

These benchmarks collect questions from diverse sources, including medical examinations, electronic health records, online resources, and expert crafting\u2026\u2026cover only some common diseases and lack extensive coverage of knowledge across various aspects of diseases. \u201d  Can you compare each of these resources the paper is referring to in this sentence with MedDisK in terms of coverage of common diseases, disease base knowledge and public availability?  How does this compare with other existing medical relational databases - MIMIC, i2b2, iBKH KG etc?\n\nI understand that the paper does interval sampling (10 examples from each interval) and engages clinical experts to provide a categorical standard - wrong, correct or partially correct.  And this resulted in the following standard (0-0.3 is wrong) and (0.3 to 0.8 is partially correct) and (0.8 to 1.0 is correct). How representative are these categories? Did the experts find that all the samples in 0.8 to 1.0 are correct and correspondingly all in 0-0.3 are wrong? Can you provide more representative examples or more thorough classification of the \u201cCompletely Wrong\u201d category?\t\n\nSince LLMs response is post-processed using the NER model I think the NER model's performance is extremely crucial to evaluation. How well does it perform in identifying medical entities? From the analysis conducted in Table 8, it appears that all the LLMs are underperforming in identifying symptoms, affected sites, etc., while they generally perform well in recognizing population ages involving numeric entities. \n\nWould it be considered a correct hit if the model predicts 'GI tract' instead of 'digestive system' in the examples from Table 3? What kind of standardization was performed in evaluating LLMs response with the experts output?\n\nWhat according to the authors are the limitations of the dataset and the evaluation procedure outlined here?"
