It is possible that similar techniques may have been previously presented elsewhere.\n\n- The experimental section of the paper is relatively weak. Given the experimental nature of the paper, it would be beneficial to compare the proposed method with more recent supervised techniques, offering more quantitative results. This could include metrics such as the average performance on a subset of the test set, providing a more robust evaluation.\n\n- Additionally, comparing the proposed approach with the DPS method seems unfair, as DPS operates in a distinct unsupervised regime where no target values are provided. Furthermore, it appears from observations, such as Figure 4, that DPS outperforms the proposed approach when the problem is expected to be solvable. For instance, when $s = 9$, it is conceivable that a simpler method, like a direct estimation of $x$ from $b$, might yield better (or comparable) results than the proposed approach.\n\n- Lastly, the experiments do not clearly demonstrate whether the role of the embedding is merely to increase the number of parameters in the neural networks, which is a well-established practice. A more convincing set of experiments would compare the proposed method with the one without embedding *but* keeping the number of learnable parameters fixed."

This work lacks of clear definitions for the terminology \u201cembedding\u201d which could hinder comprehension, especially for readers not familiar with these concepts. Since, this work shares several similarities with \u2018sparse coding\u2019, thus it is advisable to elucidate on such terms in a way that a reader from other field (especially those who are familiar with the concept of sparsity) would grasp the terms.\n\n    2. Needs improved referencing, particularly in clarifying the use of terms and concepts similar to \u2018sparse coding\u2019 and in referencing relevant works such as Tikhonov's work for $\\ell_2$ smoothness regularization.\n\n    3. citing (Tenorio et al., 2011) in this paper is not needed, and it can be removed. \n\n    4. The third paragraph on page 1 should be revised to cover three prevalent methodologies commonly employed for tackling linear inverse problems, i.e. end-to-end deep learning-based approaches, unrolled algorithms, and the plug-and-play prior framework (which employs denoisers as implicit priors). It's important to note that while these are significant approaches, they don't encompass the entirety of solving methods for such problems. Proper referencing and detailing of these methodologies will provide a comprehensive overview for the readers.\n\n    5. A subsection should also be included to discuss similar/related work, e.g., \u201cTheoretical linear convergence of unfolded ISTA and its practical weights and thresholds\u201d; \u201cALISTA: analytic weights are as good as learned weights in LISTA\u201d; \u201cSparse coding with gated learned ISTA\u201d; \u201cAda-lista: learned solvers adaptive to varying models\u201d; \u201cNeurally augmented ALISTA\u201d.\n       \n    6. The third paragraph on page 1 could be rewritten so that it covers three widely-used approaches for solving linear inverse problems with proper references, i.e. end-to-end deep learning-based methods, unrolled algorithms, and plug-and-play prior framework (or using denoiser as implicit priors) -- note that this is not the ultimate category of the solving approaches. \n\n    7. On page 2, in \u201cthe unrolling allows for greater expressiveness\u201d and \u201cthe original coordinates of the solution\u201d, \u2018expressiveness\u2019 and \u2018coordinate\u2019 are vague. On page 4, \u201csimilarly to other existing methods.\u201d is vague! They require better elaboration or clarification.\n\n    8. Equations (12) and (13) ought to be reformulated into a matrix-vector form that aligns with the structure of the forward model elucidated in Equation (1). \n\n    9. It lacks discussion regarding theoretical convergence guarantees and a comparative analysis for the results without embedding in Figure 6.\n\n    10.  Equations (8) and (9) are pertinent for analysis-based recovery, which, as per compressive sensing theory, can be achieved under the assumption of sparsity or compressibility of $z$ and incoherence between $A$ and $E$. Are these conditions met in the given scenario?\n\n    11.  The visual representation of the results, exemplified in Figures 4, 7-10, demonstrates that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of the rival method, specifically, the proximal methods.
