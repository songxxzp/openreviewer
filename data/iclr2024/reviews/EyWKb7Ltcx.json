To improve the classification of non-Euclidean features, researchers have explored intrinsic classifiers based on Riemannian geometry. However, existing approaches are limited due to their reliance on specific geometric properties. This paper introduces a general framework for designing multinomial logistic regression on Riemannian manifolds. This framework requires minimal geometric properties. The focus is on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds, and the study includes five families of parameterized Riemannian metrics to develop diverse SPD classifiers. The versatility and effectiveness of this framework are demonstrated in applications such as radar recognition, human action recognition, and EEG classification."

However, they only derive results for multinomial logistic regression on the SPD manifold.\n\nSecond, the contributions are not very clear. For example, the derivation of Theorem 3.4 has already been done in eq 17 of \"Riemannian Multiclass Logistics Regression for SPD Neural Networks\" from Chen et al. Furthermore, it can be directly derived from eq (3) by parametrizing $b_k$ as $\\langle p_k, x \\rangle$ and then interpreting the subtraction as a Riemannian logarithm.\nThe distance $d(S, \\tilde{H}_{A, P})$ is defined twice: in eq (8) and eq (11). One should be a proposition and the other a definition.\nThere is a mistake in $b_k$ in Appendix C.\n\nThird, the section 4 is really hard to understand. Specifically, the first paragraph of sub-section 4.1 discusses metrics that have not been presented so far. An example of how to apply theorem 4.2 and lemma 4.3 to a Riemannian metric should be added to understand their implications better.\n\nForth, the tables in the experiment section are not very clear. For example, in table 4, the authors mention methods [93, 30] and then [93, 70, 30]. What does it mean? The second row of results utilizes the same methods as the first row?"

                "value": "I have several concerns about the paper (please also see the question):\n\nFirst of all, there are definitions and statetements that look strange to me. \n\nAs stated by the authors, the main motivation behind the proposed approach is that it can be applied to Riemannian manifolds that only require geodesic connectedness as opposed to existing works. However, the definition of geodesic connectedness (Definition 3.1) given in the paper does not seem to be corrected. I'm wondering if \"geodesic connectedness\" means \"there exists a unique geodesic line connecting any two points\". As far as I know, the existence of a unique geodesic in Definition 3.1 is too strong. See for instance:\n\nhttps://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis6100/diffgeom-n.pdf\n\nIt says that a Riemannian manifold is connected iff any two points can be joined by a broken geodesic (a piecewise smooth curve where each curve segment is a geodesic, Proposition 12.10). \n\nAm I wrong ? Please clarify.\n\nThis also leads to another question: What are the requirements for the proposed approach to be applicable ? If the requirement is that there must exist a unique geodesic line between any two points of the manifold, then I'm wondering if the range of applicability of the proposed approach is as limited as the approach in Nguyen & Yang (2023) ? Please clarify.\n\nI also doubt the statement at the end of Section 4.2 \"our work is the first to apply EM and BWM to establish Riemannian neural networks, opening up new possibilities for utilizing these metrics in machine learning applications\". Note that Han et al. (2021) has thoroughly studied the Bures-Wasserstein (BW) geometry for Riemannian optimization on SPD manifolds, where different machine learning applications have been presented. \n\nIt is also claimed in the paper that the proposed method is applicable to a broader class of Riemannian manifolds compared to existing works. However, the derived MLRs are all built on SPD manifolds and it is not clear if the proposed method is also effective in improving existing neural networks on other manifolds, e.g. Huang et al. (2017; 2018).\n\nConcerning the experiments, the authors only present comparisons against SPDNet and SPDDSMBN. I could not find any other comparisons against state-of-the-art methods on the target applications in the supplemental material. This makes it hard to make rigorous judgments about the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to other categories of neural networks. Taking action recognition application as an example. Many DNNs have been proven effective in this application on large-scale datasets. Experiments on large-scale datasets are thus important to show the advantage of learning on SPD manifolds over other manifolds (e.g. Euclidean, hyperbolic, Stiefel,...). \n\n\n**Questions:**\n\nIn Remark 3.2, it is not clear if item (a) is an observation made by the authors or it is a well-known result in the literature. In the first case, could the authors give a brief proof for that ? Otherwise, the result should be properly cited. \n\n\n**References**\n\n1.
