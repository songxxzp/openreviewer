                "value": "The paper examines post-training quantization of neural networks featuring linear layers, taking into account cosine distortion. The authors first demonstrate the rate-distortion trade-off between the original and quantized weights to establish the step size, $\\Delta_{\\ell}$, for each layer. Notably, all $\\Delta_{\\ell}$ values are governed by a singular parameter, $k$. Additionally, the paper investigates the rate-deviation analysis, wherein the deviation assesses the disparity in output. The authors introduce surrogate models in which the quantized weight is uniformly distributed across a space subject to random rotation, characterized by the angle $\\theta_{\\ell}$. Subsequently, it is proven that the mutual information is minimized when using the product distribution."

Lemma 1 could benefit from a more rigorous presentation, especially concerning the $o(\\cdot)$. Additionally, both Lemma 1 and Corollary 1 do not appear to offer significant novel contributions.\n\n3. The surrogate model feels somewhat contrived. Moreover, the method for deriving $\\tilde{w}_{\\ell}$ is not clear. For instance, are the angles $\\theta_{\\ell}$ specified? The notion of being \"uniformly distributed on a cone\" is ambiguous due to its unbounded norm. As a result, Theorem 1 requires a more comprehensive problem definition.\n\n4. There seem to be some technical inaccuracies in the proof of Theorem 1. It is also essential to ensure that each mutual information, \n$I(w_{\\ell}, \\tilde{w}_{\\ell})$, adheres to the distortion criteria.\n\n5. The link between distortion (related to weights) and deviation (pertaining to output) is unclear."
