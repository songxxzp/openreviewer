This attack is much less effective in verification mode, 1-to-1 matching. If a system is run on identification model, collecting data from one particularly registered user is very possible. Thus, target attack can be performed. \n2.\tThe proposed work is an integration of the existing models and tools. It affects it novelty. \n3.\tThis work can be considered as an extension of Friedlander et al 2022, which also generates 2D and 3D master faces. The proposed work uses better components to achieve better performance. It further weakens the novelty. \n4.\tThe presentation of the experimental session is not good enough. I read several times to try to understand the contents. The authors also use abbreviation defined in appendix, e.g., dev. The table numbers in the main text are not in order. Very significant effort is needed to improve the presentation.\n5.\tMost of the attacks are ineffective. Many zero FMR in Table 3. Most important, in black-box setting, the attack is totally ineffective. \n6.\tThe current study is in digital domain but 3D face is called in physical domain.\n7.\tFurthermore, all the previous related works are published in the biometric conference and biometric journals.

Which are the data used to learn the 3DMM in the different experiments?\n- 3DMM are not very good to reproduce fine shape details of the face. So one question here is how this impact in the proposed solution. Is it something desired this lck of detail or a more precise 3D face generation solution could be helpful?\n- the 3D information is transformed to depth images. How does this solution affect the method? Would it be possible to work directly in the 3D domain? \n- the BU-3DFE and Texas3D datasets are quite low-resolution with smooth surfaces. So, it can be this lack of details can couple better with the used 3DMM. Authors should use higher-resolution 3D datasets. I strongly suggest to use the FRGC v2.0 dataset."
