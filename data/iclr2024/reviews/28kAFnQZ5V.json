The proposed tensor based method can incorporate multi-object relationships using Tucker decomposition. In particular, for the attention layer, along with the query Q and memory (key) K embeddings, a semantics embedding S is considered, and the attention mechanism is defined through a Tucker decomposition with a trainable core tensor G. Then an aggregation layer is used to convert the multi-dimensional attention tensor into a 2D matrix by summing up along the semantics axis. Several numerical results are presented an a Reddit dataset to illustrate the performance of the method compared to the standard attention and an alternate tensor attention mechanisms."

This might be interesting in applications where there is natural multi-dimensional correlations such as videos, genetics and others.\n\nI have the following comments about the paper:\n\n1.  The intuition behind introducing the semantics information when defining attention, and what information does the 3rd order tensor capture are not very clear. There does not seem to be any activation function (say softmax) used after the Tucker product. Typically, the attention mechanism tries to capture key token to token interactions. Here, it is not clear that does the attention layer learn.\n\n\n2. The paper presents interesting numerical results. However, there are few questions here. \nFirst, the exposition seems limited as only one dataset is considered with just 2 types of semantics. Are there other datasets or settings/applications where there might be natural multi-dimensional objects.\nSecond, the evaluation metric considered seems slightly different from other attention based papers,  where typically accuracy is considered. Perhaps R_{10}@1 is similar. Is there a reason why R_{10}@k is considered?\nNext, in the results presented, it appears TAM has more #params than the standard BERT. Perhaps the performance gain is due to this. It would be interesting to see if standard attention would come close to TAM if similar #params are used. \nLastly, why does TAM without semantics information perform better than standard BERT or tensorized attention?\n\n\nMinor Comment:\ni. Use \\citep to get the standard citation form. Otherwise it results in double parentheses if (\\cite{}) is used."

It is similar to the argument because previous methods use more parameters, they suffer from overfitting.\n\n- The experiments are incomprehensive. Executing the method on only one dataset is insufficient to assess its effectiveness.\n\n[1] Actbert: Learning global-local video-text representations, CVPR 2020."
