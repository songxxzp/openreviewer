This work mainly taken the temporal attention window which results in an increase in number of parameters and that may be the reason why the authors get accuracy improvement. I am not sure if the temporal attention has anything to do with it. If yes, it ll be good if the authors can elaborate. Further,there is no result on imagenet dataset. I feel the reason why authors didn't do it was the temporal attention ll explode the overall parameter requirement which becomes unmanageable in alarge dataset. On the other hand, the original spikeformer work has imagenet results. Kindly clarify the scalability of your approach or discuss its limitations.\n\n- Specificity of Application: While DISTA shows significant improvements in vision tasks, its adaptability to other types of tasks is not demonstrated. Can the authors comment on this?\n\n- Overfitting Risk: There's a potential risk of overfitting as the model complexity increases with multiple attention mechanisms, though this is not explicitly discussed in the paper. Can the authors provide their opinion on this?\n\n- Can the authors do some off the shelf energy estimations maybe by using some spiking hardware simulator tools like [1] (its understandable if the authors are not able to do it fully, a qualitative discussion on the efficiency benefits- as in whether they expect sparsity advantage at compute level or memory storage reduction from a hardware point of view will be useful) ?

                "value": "Originality \n- Incorporating spiking neural networks with the vision transformers is a very recent yet challenging issue. The authors are expanding on the work of Spikformer [1]. Even that work is very recent. The main objective of the paper is to make efficient spiking transformers that take advantage of temporal information.  Previous work is lacking in this regard; however, the authors have tackled this issue and improved the approach. They also involve a denoising technique for the accumulated spatiotemporal maps since they do not use a rather complicated function Softmax. Therefore, I believe this work is reasonably new and the concept itself deserves more attention. \n\nQuality\n- Spiking neural networks, more or less, mimic biological networks. Of course, it all depends on the biological plausibility of the models. For example, leaky integrate and fire models are very efficient neuromorphic models; however, compared to the Hodgkin-Huxley model, they are comparatively less biologically plausible. Thus said, current neuromorphic hardware does take advantage of the concept of LIF models to develop an SNN-based chip, and these models are not just space-efficient but also energy-efficient.\n- Given the progression in transformers, the authors of this paper have shown that making transformers more biologically plausible can indeed have significant advantages over the other neuromorphic approaches. They do so by comparing against the most recent Spikformer [1], and other neuromorphic approaches with variable time steps.\n- Specifically, the authors have integrated learnable time-constant (tau), which is a very important parameter in LIF that decides the significance of the input at the current time-step to the future ones. Further, to make the spatiotemporal attention mechanism less computationally expensive, the spiking networks have discarded Softmax masking, instead, the authors have used a threshold-based masking technique that significantly reduces the computational overhead.\n- The authors have shown significant improvement over the other baseline approaches, and have done extensive ablation studies. \n\nClarity\n- The paper is well-written and straightforward. The objective is clearly stated and tackled reasonably well throughout the paper.\n\nSignificance\n- Since this approach is tackling a very recent and significant challenge of making neural networks more energy-efficient using spiking neural networks, it could have a good impact on the current research.\n\nReferences:\n1.
