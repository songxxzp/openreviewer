The paper seems to miss discussion of this and sharing what settings used in the presented results, and how authors reached that setting.\n\n2- The adversarial objective may pickup noisy or outliers and divert the optimization. I think this deserves more investigations. \n\n3- The learning objective is encouraging reduction of loss variance across groups, I was wondering why authors didn\u2019t directly go for optimization macro average of loss which is a bit more intuitive and has less chance to have side-effects on the overall performance as mean is generally more stable than variance?\n\n4- Robust optimization has been extensively studied in the general optimization context. Many of such methods could be applicable to the RLHF/LLM problem and the method proposed in this paper is also also applicable to other settings. I do not see any comparisons to support this method is optimal for RLHF compared to existing robust optimization methods.\n\n5- Related to the previous two comments, we we should have compared with other robust optimization methods and variations of applying the group loss\n\n6- In Section 3, \u201cThe training of an AI assistant consists of three main stages...\u201c is not necessarily the case for all AI Assistants. I suggest revising this statement and connecting the presented method to more broader usecases as it is not really limited to this case."

Essentially this automatically adds additional training weight to difficult examples. The paper then presents empirical evidence that the proposed approach substantially improves response quality."

                "value": "The paper is motivated by the notion that maximizing only the expected return of a policy can be suboptimal when the return distribution has high variance or long tails. In Reinforcement Learning, the goal is to learn a policy that performs consistently across different data groups or scenarios. Here the group refers to different data distributions with varying performance characteristics. To achieve this, the authors propose incorporating a group inference classifier in the critic model to softly assign data points to groups. They maximize a variance objective to amplify the differences between groups. Additionally, they introduce an adaptive KL regularization scheme that allows different groups to have varied regularization strengths. This balances exploration and exploitation based on the group's difficulty. In summary, the paper aims to improve policy generalization by minimizing performance disparities between automatically identified data groups, while dynamically adapting the regularization to enable optimized exploration."

Good experimental results. \tThe method demonstrates good experimental results, outperforming baselines on in-distribution data. This highlights its capabilities in known domains.

The approach relies on accurate group label inference. Incorrect initial grouping could potentially lead to improper KL penalties.
