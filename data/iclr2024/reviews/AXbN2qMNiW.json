                "value": "The paper introduces a novel approach named BindNet, designed for the pretraining of protein and ligand 3D representations. This method leverages two core objectives:\n\n    Utilizing 3D representations of proteins and ligands sourced from Uni-Mol, BindNet aims to predict the pairwise atomic distances between atoms within a ligand-protein 3D complex.\n\n    BindNet also employs protein 3D representations from Uni-Mol to predict masked ligand 3D representations, also obtained from Uni-Mol.\n\nBoth of these tasks are initially pretrained on a subset of the BioLiP dataset. Subsequently, the resulting protein and ligand representations are fine-tuned for tasks such as binding affinity prediction (LBA 30%, LBA 60%, LEP), virtual screening (DUDe, AD), and docking (CASF-2016). The performance of BindNet is compared against several baseline methods including UniMol, CoSP, GeoSSL, DeepAffinity, and SMT-DTA.\n\nThe study demonstrates that BindNet outperforms these baseline methods significantly in various downstream tasks. Additionally, the authors conduct an analysis to determine the importance of each pretraining objective in the process of representation learning.\n\nWhile the experimental results are interesting, there are some concerns regarding the adequacy of leakage controls, a lack of comparison to stronger baselines, and the overall reproducibility of the research."

It's the first time I've encountered a research work where the 3D protein-ligand complex is harnessed to learn a unified representation for both proteins and ligands, which has promising implications for practical binding affinity prediction.\n\nBoth of the proposed objectives for acquiring this joint representation yield compelling results, despite their simplicity. The paper is excellently written and presents a comprehensible narrative. The experiments encompass a wide range of tasks, including affinity prediction, docking, and virtual screening, and they feature thorough comparisons against numerous baseline techniques, including state-of-the-art methods in the field."

It appears that the representations learned from BioLiP, which contains a subset of PDBind used for validating the results, may introduce a form of leakage, thus giving pretrained methods an advantage over other baseline techniques. To address this, it is advisable to consider re-executing the experiments with the exclusion of all overlapping data between BioLiP and the downstream tasks, including overlaps with datasets for binding affinity prediction (LBA 30%, LBA 60%, LEP), virtual screening (DUDe, AD), and docking (CASF-2016).\n\nFurthermore, I recommend including state-of-the-art protein representations like ESM-2 and ESM-1b (accessible at https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm), molecular representations such as MolFormer (available at https://github.com/IBM/molformer), and simple yet effective drug representations like Morgan fingerprints as baseline representations for a more comprehensive comparison.\n\nAnother significant concern is the reproducibility of the work. The absence of available code, missing details regarding hyperparameter settings, and the lack of transparency in releasing experimental settings, including dataset splits and configurations for downstream tasks, hinder the reproducibility of the research. Addressing these issues would greatly enhance the credibility and transparency of the work."
