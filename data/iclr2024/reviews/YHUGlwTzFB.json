Traditionally, models rely heavily on heuristic and empirical studies without further adaptation. The authors challenge this convention by introducing a mechanism that allows the model to actively query an oracle (typically a human) during test-time to obtain labels for certain instances. The objective is to enhance the model's performance on the test set by leveraging this limited interaction with the oracle.\n\nThe primary contributions of the paper are as follows:\n\n1. Introduction of the Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) framework.\n2. A novel algorithm for determining which instances should be queried from the oracle, based on their potential impact on the model's performance.\n3. Experimental validation of the ATTA framework on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvement in performance over non-adaptive baselines."

While the approach shows promise on benchmark datasets, its scalability to very large datasets or real-world applications remains untested. The computational overhead of deciding which instances to query and updating the model during test-time could be prohibitive in some scenarios.\n\n3. The paper assumes a limited budget of queries to the oracle. In many real-world scenarios, determining this budget or ensuring its strict adherence might be challenging.\n\n4. Continually adapting the model during test-time based on feedback from the oracle could lead to overfitting, especially if the test set is not representative of the broader data distribution."

First, the theory establishes a learning bound that has the notions of composition of training data, estimated distribution shift, and ideal joint hypothesis performance. Second, the fore-mentioned theory is utilized to shown that catastrophic forgetting can be mitigated by performing selective sample selection through entropy minimization. \n\nSimATTA, a practical algorithm built upon the ATTA theory, is then developed. It integrates incremental learning and selective entropy minimization techniques. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks simulating distribution shifts demonstrate the effectiveness of SimATTA when compared to the existing work. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy under distribution shifts while maintaining the computational complexity that is not significantly higher than that of the prior work."

There are many hyper-parameters in this work, such as two entropy thresholds $e_l$ and $e_h$, number of cluster centroid budget $NC(t)$, centroid increase number $k$, etc. The question is how to choose them for different datasets. In some sense, this is not the weakness/limitation of this particular paper but rather applies to the whole AL paradigm.\n\n4. It is unclear what the meaning of `steps=10` is. And what is the config of SimATTA? SimATTA (`steps=1`) or SimATTA (`steps=10`)?\n\n5. How to deal with an extreme situation in which only one sample is in a mini-batch, i.e., the batch size is 1.\n\n6. Another minor question is, why the performance of Enhanced TTA on Tiny-ImageNet-C (severity level 5) is poor? Also, why the baseline results (CLUE) on VLCS of Tab. 4 are too low, even worse than that of the Random method?\n\n7. In Section 5.2, \"randomly select labeled samples and fine-tune them with `their selected pseudo-label samples.`\" Is it a mistake?"
