They multiply the final score with the maximum logit output to boost\nperformance. They run experiments with common benchmarks on image classification."

                "value": "1. At times, the manuscript is a bit misleading. For instance, the sentence \"Intuitively, these properties depicts the tendency of the network to maximally separate class features while minimizing the separation within them\" is quite counter-intuitive. I'd suggest the authors to proofread the manuscript again to make it easier to digest.\n\n2. Although NECO shows strong ID classification and OOD detection capabilities across aggregated benchmarks, it undeperformson standalone datasets such as ImageNet-O, Textures, and iNaturalist depending on the encoding architecture that is used. An explanation for this behavior could make a stronger case for the paper.\n\n3. Since NECO is a post-hoc method, it is not obvious from the manuscript at what point in the training process does the neural collapse occurs for NECO to kick in. In other words, a model could still be well-trained without necessarily reaching the neural collapse phase. In that specific case, would NECO require training the model a bit more, or how would NECO's performance compare with say NuSA or ViM?\n\n4. NECO makes a somewhat stringent assumption that the subspace of the ID (and OOD?) is linear by making use of PCA to learn the matrix $P$ spanned by the d eigenvectors corresponding to the largest d eigenvalues of the covariance matrix $H$, where $H$ represents the feature space of the ID data. I think a justification as to why this feature space is linear is important. A non-linear dimensionality reduction, or a manifold-based learning method, would be more appropriate given the fact that neural nets are non-linear in nature."
