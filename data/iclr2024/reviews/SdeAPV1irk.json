The authors present a method that decreases the sample complexity of randomized smoothing in the setting where there is a classifier $f$ and an approximation of the same classifier $f^p$ (for example, $f^p$ is a quantized version of $f$).

The method relies on estimating the disparity $\\zeta_x$ which is the upper bound on the probability that outputs of $f$ and $f^p$ are distinct."

I find one of the assumptions very strong and the practical implications of the method very limited. More detail below. \n\nThe authors state the following sentence in the abstract:\n\n_``[...] when the smoothed model is modified (e.g., quantized or pruned), certification guarantees may not hold for the modified DNN, and recertifying from scratch can be prohibitively expensive.``_\n\nLet $f$ be a base classifier, $f^p$ be a quantized version of $f$, and let $g$ be the smooth version of $f$ and $g^p$ be the smooth version of $f^p$. \nIt is true that a certificate computed from the _base model_ $f$ will not hold for the quantized version $f^p$. However, it would be possible to apply randomized smoothing directly to the quantized version $f^p$ via:\n$$\ng^p(x) = \\underset{c \\in \\mathcal{Y}}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\ \\mathbb{P}_\\epsilon [\\ f^p(x + \\epsilon) = c\\ ]\n$$\n\nInstead, the authors propose to compute the certificate of $f^p$ by first computing the certificate for $f$ (which is the unquantized model and therefore expensive to run) and then computing the disparity $\\zeta_x$, which is an upper bound on the probability that the outputs of $f$ and $f^p$ are different.  \n$\\rightarrow$ It seems to me that this method is more expensive than computing the certificate directly on the quantized version $f^p$. \n\nTo claim that the approach is more efficient, the authors **assume** that the certificates for $f$ are available **for all $x$**, and therefore only the disparity $\\zeta_x$ is needed to compute the new certificate. The authors state:  \n\n_``The IRS algorithm utilizes a cache $C_f$, which stores information obtained from the RS execution of the classifier $f$ for each input $x$. The cached information is crucial for the operation of IRS. $C_f$ stores the top predicted class index and its lower confidence bound $\\underline{p_A}$ for $f$ on input $x$.``_\n\n$\\rightarrow$ The authors assume that the test data is already available and that the certificates have already been computed. I don't see how this can be realistic, especially since the authors mention that the quantized version $f^p$ can be used on edge devices, except perhaps if the model is only used for a limited set of inputs that are known in advance.\n\nCan the authors comment on this and provide a practical use case that I may have missed?"

Given a modified version of a base model $f_p$ for some original base model $f$, the task is to provide a robustness certificate for the prediction of smoothed model $g_p$ at a point $x$ by efficiently reusing the values observed when calculating the certificate for smoothed model $g$ at the same $x$. The authors propose to do this using the fact that the difference between the value $g(x + \\epsilon)$ and $g_p(x + \\epsilon)$ around any point $x$ is very small (close to $0$) and the fact that the number of binomial samples required to estimate a parameter close to 0 is much smaller than the number of samples needed to estimate a binomial parameter close to 0.5. Given the difference in the value of $g$ and $g_p$ around a point $x$ and the certificate for $g(x)$, the authors give a formula to bound the certificate for $g_p$ at $x$."
