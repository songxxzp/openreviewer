This limitation makes it difficult for conventional models to generalize well to unseen fault patterns. To address this, the authors introduce a domain generalization method, Load-Domain (LD) domain generalization, specifically designed based on the CWRU bearing dataset. In this method, the domains are divided based on different operating conditions that have specific loads, which correspond to the actual load magnitude. This inclusion of physical information helps enhance the model's accuracy for unknown domains. The authors propose the Feature Shift Network (FSN), which is trained to shift features between adjacent source domains and the target domain for better generalization. The effectiveness of FSN is shown through experiments on both the CWRU bearing dataset and the MNIST dataset, where FSN outperforms existing methods."

The abbreviation in Paragraph 3, Section 2 might be RAP. In the second line of paragraph in section \u201cDistribution Law Conjecture\u201d, F_p should be the the mapping relation between features, not labels.\n2. Besides the ones from 1., the Experiment part (e.g., paragraph 4 in \u201cClassical Model Contrast\u201d part) is hard to understand. Bad formatting and discontinuous sentences make it unreadable to me.\n3. Key references are absent. In the first paragraph of Section 4.2, methods aligning the three types of distributions should be cited to justify the categorization. The compared methods in \u201cComparison with Classical Models\u201d should also be referred to, and the Li et al. (2018) reference in this paragraph is wrongly cited, this paper should be \u201cDeep Domain Generalization via Conditional Invariant Adversarial Networks\u201d.\n4. As to the experimental results, the metric of Table 1 is not clearly stated. Also, the experimental details like backbone choice, learning rate, optimization schedules are not provided.\n5. The setting is still too limited. The current method and experiments only focus on generalizing from highly relevant and sequential source domains to a target domain close to the last seen source domain. The performance of the proposed method should be further evaluated on broader settings where the relationship of source and target domains is not fixed. Also, the setting seems much relevant to that of Continuous Domain Generalization, which should be discussed."
