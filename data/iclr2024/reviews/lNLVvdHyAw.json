The paper would benefit from including evaluations on the adaptive attack setting. Currently, the perplexity s calculated using another LLM, namely GPT-2, which can potentially be deceived by adversarial attacks such as GCG. It is essential to consider that an attacker may strategically leverage the proposed defense mechanism to perform an overall optimization and potentially overcome the entire system. Therefore, it is important for the authors to explore and address this potential vulnerability in their evaluation.\n\n3. A more realistic scenario to consider is when the benign tokens of the prompt are considerably longer, while the adversarial suffix only consists of a few words. In such cases, the overall adversarial prompt may still maintain a relatively low perplexity (PPL) value. It would be valuable for the authors to acknowledge and discuss this potential challenge, as it can have implications for the effectiveness of the proposed detection method."

To address this, they consider both perplexity and token sequence length as two features, and train a classifier to reduce false positive rates. Overall, this work demonstrates a potential way to defend against adversarial suffixes."
