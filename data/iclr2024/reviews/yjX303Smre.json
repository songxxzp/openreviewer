The key contributions of this work is (1) using softmax-based per-expert context distribution to model the curriculum which enables validity and multi-modality of the sampled context curriculum; (2) using trust-region and PPO to stabilize the bi-level policy training. The proposed approach is compared against two baselines BBRL and SVSL on Table Tennis Env and Box Pushing Env and shown to outperform baselines."

To better understand the action space of the contextual episode-based policy, could the author give some details or examples of the concept of motion primitives and how to convert the policy parameters into the episode-wise robot action trajectory?\n\n2. Eq (3) seems to be not original from this work, a proper reference would help readers to understand the background of this line of work.\nThe derivation from Eq (4) to Eq (5) and Eq (6) is unclear. It would be more clear to have an intermediate objective which is jointly optimizing for $\\pi(\\theta|c, o)$ and $\\pi(c|o)$, and derive from there to have two separate objectives for bi-level optimization.\n\n3. In Section 3.1, it says \u201cmapping the context $c$ to a mean vector and a covariance matrix\u201d and \u201cNote that in most cases a context dependent covariance matrix is not useful and introduces unnecessary complex relations.\u201d It is confusing that whether the covariance matrix in the implementation is context dependent.\n\n4. Line 10 in Section 3.2, should \u201cFig. 2c\u201d be \u201cFig. 2d\u201d?\n\n5. Which terms in Eq (8) and Eq (9) accounts for encouraging the coverage of the context space by experts? From the formulation, it seems to try to learn a set of policy each of which can solve the entire task space as much as possible. The learning of policies seem to be relatively independent and is it possible to learn a set of experts whose preferred context distributions are the same.\n\n6. More testing environment description would be helpful. Some details about action space and reward definitions are missing for both tasks.\n\n7. Evaluating the algorithm on more environments will make the comparison more thorough. For example, it would be helpful to evaluate on the other tasks used in Otto et al. 2023.\n\n8. It would also helpful to show complete comparison against both SVSL and BBRL on all evaluated tasks (at least provide comparison plots in Appendix)\n\n9. Given the proposed approach is built upon SVSL with two improvements, it would be great to do ablation study on both improvement techniques.\n\n10. The multi-modality in this work is achieved by mixture of experts, however each expert is still modeled by uni-model gaussian policy. \n\n11. Recent work (Huang et al. 2023 [1]) proposes some multi-modal policy parameterization. How is the proposed approach compare to this work and can the proposed approach enhanced by the policy reparameterization from [1]?\n\n12. Is this proposed approach also applicable to step-based RL problems?\n\n[1] Huang et al, Reparameterized Policy Learning for Multimodal Trajectory Optimization."
