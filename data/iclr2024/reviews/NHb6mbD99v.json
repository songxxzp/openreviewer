A typical probem in offline RL is that algorithms suffer from OOD issues, an attempt to remedy this is to stay close to the data distribution. This paper achieves this by decomposing the actor into a behavior policy part and perturbation part, the behavior policy is learned by a diffusion generative model and perturbation part is learnable by the distributional risk-averse RL loss. The contribution of the policy is controlled by a hyperparameter $\\lambda$. The method achieves SotA results in risk-averseness on multiple benchmarks and is comparable to risk-netural algorithms on D4RL, some sensitivity analysis is provided."

You use diffusion generative models to model the behavior policy, that's it?\n\np2.par2 - \"We conducted extensive experiments in three different environments covering both risk-sensitive\" - it's 3 different benchmarks, you use multiple environments of D4RL.\n\np3. par2 - \"For simplify\" - to simplify\n\nIn Section 4 and earlier you talk about \"risk-distortion operators\", but you do not define the concept in the background section, yet it seems essential for your method.\n\nIn Section 4.1 you talk about implicit quantile functions, yet this concept has not been defined (what is implicit about them?) and no reference is given, I suppose you need [1].\n\nThere is no citation for the quantile Huber loss, you should provide a citation for it and refer to the equations the first time it is mentioned (ideally the definition would preceed  the first usage of the function).\n\np3, last par - you say that you use both uniform sampling and a quantile proposal network, then you say that you don't use a quantile proposal network and leave it for future work? If you don't use it, don't mention it here or mention it as a comment (an alternative is to use a quantile proposal network such as in (xyz citation)\n\nIn eq. 5, I suppose that you have N fixed quantile levels $\\tau_i$, hence the indexing. However, this was not mentioned previously, yet it is part of the methodology (also along the lines of earlier work?). Moreover, the loss is a function o $\\theta$ and there is no expectation defined over s, a, s', a', though the quantile td error depends on the former. Also, \"J\" is commonly used as return? Also normalizing factor should be $N^2$?\n\neq. 6 - is it \"distortion risk function\" or \"risk-distortion function\"? I also don't understand this loss function, you have expectations wrt. marginal state distribution, however you have an action appearing in the implicit quantile function, where does the action come from? You are missing a policy here, please define this correctly.\n\nI think that your description of diffusion generative modelling needs significant adjustments. What you call an $\\epsilon$-model is the denoiser, the Gaussian reverse process transition kernel arises from a continuous treatment of diffusion and exactly because of the choice of noise schedule. Since you don't provide contributions on level of diffusion generative modelling, this shouldn't take so much space of the paper.\n\np6 -   CQL is not a distributional RL algorithm?\n\nsuggestion for table 1 - use colors instead of bold and *\n\nfigure 2 needs correction, y axis is not visible, also there are no error bands - how do we know what is the stability across reruns?\n\nIs the diffusion generative model absolutely necessary in order to achieve this performance? Would you switch it out for a CVAE in order to compare?\n\n[1] Will Dabney, Georg Ostrovski, David Silver, R\u00e9mi Munos, \"Implicit Quantile Networks for Distributional Reinforcement Learning\""
