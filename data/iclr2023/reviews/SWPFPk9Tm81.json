Due to little originality and minimal assessment, the paper is not suitable for the ICLR.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The application of deep learning to EEG denoising looks interesting, but novelty in the proposed approach is lacking. The authors seem aware of ICA and EEGNet, but other successful strategies, such as EMD or BrainDecode are unfortunately ignored. Another submission limitation is a minimal and not-that-perfect evaluation on a tiny open-access dataset. The proposed CLEEGN is a standard and of the shelf available convolutional encoded + decoder, thus hard to find novelty in the proposed approach. ",

In Figure 1, the differentiation of each part in the encoder and decoder is not clear and it is recommended that it be redrawn.\n2. How can the Decoder part of the model process data of size [1*T*C] and output a result of size [C*T*1] using a convolution kernel of size (C,1)?\n3. Is the purpose of denoising and reconstructing to approximate the effect of the offline denoising method? The reference EEG is demanding and how to ensure that the reference EEG is clean.\n4. There are certain errors in the Decoder module in Table 1.\n5. The experimental setup is unclear. How are the data sets divided? Is the data used after some pre-processing, or is it raw data without any processing? How are the model parameters set? \n6. The experimental results of EEGNet on the raw data should be added to Tables 2 and 3.",

The novelty of the paper is relatively ordinary. The implementation code is not provided reducing the reproducibility.",

Could the authors also envision instead synthetically adding artifacts to clean EEG (potentially also synthetic) data? Not necessarily as part of this manuscript, but these questions would be worth discussing a bit.\n\nAlso more datasets and cross-dataset performance may be interesting, like would it be possible to go towards a general-purpose reconstruction method that can be applied to a new dataset without training? Some discussion on that could be interesting as well.\n\n",
